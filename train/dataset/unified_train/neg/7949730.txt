we present linkage map intracisternal a-particle (iap) proviral loci. the
iap family consists 2000 endogenous proviral elements widely
dispersed mouse genome. map constructed using interspecific 
backcross markers defined oligonucleotide probes specific subclasses
of expressed iap elements. genomic dna c57bl/6j mouse, probes 
detected 12 44 hindiii restriction fragments represent junctions
between proviral 5'-flanking dna. fragments characteristic strain
distribution patterns (sdps) particularly polymorphic dnas of
c57bl/6j mus spretus mice used backcross. iap loci placed the
map comparison distribution patterns known genetic
markers backcross. map includes 51 iap loci been
previously mapped 23 iap proviruses previously mapped in
recombinant inbred (ri) strains. comparable map positions obtained 
iap markers interspecific backcross ri strains. mapped iap
loci widely dispersed x chromosome (chr) autosomes
except chrs 9 19, providing useful genetic markers linkage studies.
