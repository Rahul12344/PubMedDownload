the emergence mutations leading drug resistance main cause of
therapeutic failure human hiv infection. chemical system biology approach 
has drawn great attention discover new antiretroviral hits high efficacy 
and negligible toxicity, used prerequisite hiv drug
resistance global action plan 2017-21. discover potential hits, docked 49
antiretroviral analogs (n = 6294) hiv-1 reverse transcriptase q151m
mutant & wild-type form narrow downed number three sequential
modes docking using schrödinger suite. later on, 80 ligands better
docking score reference ligands (tenofovir lamivudine) screened for
adme, toxicity prediction, binding energy estimation. simultaneously, the
area curve (auc) estimated using receiver operating characteristics
(roc) curve analysis validate docking protocols. finally, single point energy 
and molecular dynamics simulation approaches performed best two ligands 
(l3 l14). study reveals antiretroviral efficacy obtained two best
ligands delivers hits hiv-1 reverse transcriptase q151m mutant.
