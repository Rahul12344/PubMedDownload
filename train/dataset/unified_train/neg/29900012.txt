zika virus (zikv), mosquito-borne flavivirus, first identified 1940s
in uganda africa emerged americas brazil may 2015. 30 
months since zikv emerged major public health problem, spectacular progress 
has made vaccine development cumulating publication three
reports phase 1 clinical trials 4th quarter 2017. clinical trials
involving candidate dna purified inactivated virus vaccines showed were
safe well-tolerated small number volunteers induced
neutralizing antibodies, although varied vaccine candidate dosing
regimen. results suggest zika vaccine developed that
phase 2 clinical trials warranted. however, difficult compare the
results different phase 1 studies neutralizing antibodies
induced licensed flavivirus vaccines (japanese encephalitis, tick-borne
encephalitis, yellow fever) neutralizing antibody assays vary and,
unfortunately, standards zika virus neutralizing antibodies. 
addition clinical studies, substantial progress continues made in
nonclinical development, particularly terms ability candidate
vaccines protect reproductive tissues, potential use monoclonal
antibodies passive prophylaxis.
