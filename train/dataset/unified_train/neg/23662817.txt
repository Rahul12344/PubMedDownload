development hepatitis c virus (hcv) entry inhibitors represents emerging
approach satisfies tandem mechanism use inhibitors a
multifaceted cocktail. screening chinese herbal extracts, oleanolic acid (oa) 
was found display weak potency inhibit hcv entry ic50 10 μm.
chemical exploration triterpene compound revealed pharmacophore
requirement blocking hcv entry, rings a, b, e, conserved ring d
is tolerant modifications. hydroxylation c-16 significantly enhanced
its potency inhibiting hcv entry ic50 1.4 μm. modification by
conjugation new lead disaccharide 28-cooh removed undesired
hemolytic effect and, importantly, increased potency ~5-fold (54a,
ic50 0.3 μm). formation triterpene dimer via linker bearing triazole (70) 
dramatically increased potency ic50 ~10 nm. mechanistically, such
functional triterpenes interrupt interaction hcv envelope protein e2 
and receptor cd81 via binding e2, thus blocking virus host cell
recognition. study establishes importance triterpene natural products
as new leads development potential hcv entry inhibitors.
