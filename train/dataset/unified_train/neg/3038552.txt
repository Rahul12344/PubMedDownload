thirty-four patients without igg antibodies cytomegalovirus (cmv) prior
to open heart surgery studied. patients randomized receive blood
either unselected donors, donors without detectable cmv antibodies. 
fresh whole blood mainly used. eleven patients received cmv seronegative
blood only. uneventful convalescence period remained seronegative.
ten 23 patients received blood unselected donors typical cmv 
disease onset symptoms third fourth postoperative week, and
fever lasting two three weeks. liver enzyme release later
seroconversion cmv. four patients hospitalized period.
the incidence symptomatic cmv infection open heart surgery higher
than usually reported among cmv seronegative patients. selection blood
donors lack antibodies cmv may adequate protective measure.
avoidance fresh blood reduced use blood products presumably also of
importance.
