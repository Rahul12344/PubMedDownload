using reverse genetics (rg), generated two reassortant viruses carrying the
ns1 gene two closely related hpaiv lpaiv h7n1 variants (designated rgh7n7 
hp(hpns1) rgh7n7 hp(lpns1), respectively) backbone hp h7n7
strain a/chicken/netherlands/621557/03 (rgh7n7 hp). comparison these
reassortants allowed us determine effect amino acid differences 
nuclear export nucleolar localization sequences ns1 pathogenesis in
chickens. compared rgh7n7 hp(lpns1), delay weight gain increase in
mortality observed rgh7n7 hp(hpns1). furthermore, increase viral
load brains, lungs, cloacal swabs, well increased induction of
mrna type interferons pro-inflammatory cytokines brains, were
observed rgh7n7 hp(hpns1). comparison rgh7n7 hp(lpns1) backbone
strain rgh7n7 hp allowed us examine differences pathogenesis due to
differences ns1 alleles. rgh7n7 hp, contained allele ns1 showed a
higher vitro replication rate proved virulent isogenic
virus carrying allele b ns1(rgh7n7 hp(lpns1)). addition, higher virus
accumulation lungs brains, increased induction host gene
responses, especially brains, found rgh7n7 hp compared rgh7n7 
hp(lpns1). large differences observed type interferon expression 
the lungs chickens infected viruses, suggesting that
differences virulence due differences ns1 could related to
differences induction pro-inflammatory cytokines vital organs such
as brains.
