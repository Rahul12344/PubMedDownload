highly immunogenic artificial complexes based synthetic immunopotentiating
polyions (artificial antigens vaccines).

petrov rv, khaitov rm.

an interpretive review theoretical experimental data the
immunogenetic concept "there strong weak antigens, high
and low responder genotypes," developed upheld authors presented.
to achieve phenotypic correction (finding ways turning genetically low
responder individuals high responder ones) authors developed
complex antigens--artificial macromolecular complexes containing the
required antigenic determinants adjuvant structures. synthetic nonnatural
carbohydrates heterochain polyions controlled structure (paa, pvp,
polyconidine quarternary salts) shown act immunopotentiators,
substituting helper signal t-cells. authors' data confirm this
immunogenetic principle developing highly immunogenic preparations,
prototypes future vaccines.
