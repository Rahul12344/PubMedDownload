grapevine fanleaf virus (gflv) detected samples bermuda grass (bg) from
iran reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) using two
different pairs gflv-specific primers, also enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (elisa) using antiserum specific north american isolate virus.
rt-pcr detected gflv fresh dried bg tissues virus preparations
purified plants. cloning sequencing rt-pcr products
confirmed amplified sequences sections gflv coat protein
gene. similar results obtained random oligo(dt) primers used
on viral rna templates recovered bg synthesize cdna cloning and
sequencing. virus induced symptoms bg, could nonetheless 
transmitted bg chenopodium quinoa mechanical inoculation. some
isolates induced systemic chlorotic spots leaf deformation; others remained
symptomless plant. symptomatic symptomless c. quinoa plants were
found infected gflv, giving positive elisa rt-pcr tests. north
american isolate gflv found mechanically transmissible bg as
indicated positive rt-pcr results root samples inoculated plants.
gflv-infected bg widely distributed fars province iran.
