interferon production mammalian cells grown serum-free medium.

pumper rw, molander l.

interferon, produced rabbit heart cells grown serum-free medium, failed
to protect rabbit heart serum-free cells, protected rabbit heart
serum-containing-medium cells vaccinia vesicular stomatitis virus.
interferon produced serum-free cells greater species specificity than
that produced serum-containing media. difference activity shown 
be due lack adsorption serum-free-medium cells.
