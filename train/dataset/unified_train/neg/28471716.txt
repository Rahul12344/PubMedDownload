viral infections play direct indirect roles etiology bovine 
mastitis. mx dynamin-like gtpase 2 (mx2) gene main effector antiviral
innate immune defense mediated type interferon (ifn i), was
demonstrated confer positive antiviral responses many viruses. given the
importance mx2 modulating host immune response, mx2 gene may a
suitable candidate gene studying disease resistance dairy cattle. here, we
scanned sequence variation mx2 gene chinese indigenous cattle
breeds. twenty-three previously reported snps identified. analyze
the effects snps detected mastitis disease, analysis two snps (g.787527 
c > t g.787610 t > c) 297 chinese holstein cows revealed significant
association somatic cell score (scs). although functional studies are
necessary ascertain whether two snps causal polymorphisms merely 
in linkage true causal snps, implementation two snps genetic
markers dairy industry may beneficial selecting individuals with
lower scs.
