the majority human emerging infectious diseases zoonotic, viruses
that originate wild mammals particular concern (for example, hiv, ebola and
sars). understanding patterns viral diversity wildlife determinants 
successful cross-species transmission, spillover, therefore key goals 
pandemic surveillance programs. however, analytical tools exist identify
which host species likely harbour next human virus, viruses
can cross species boundaries. conduct comprehensive analysis of
mammalian host-virus relationships show total number viruses
that infect given species proportion likely zoonotic are
predictable. controlling research effort, proportion zoonotic
viruses per species predicted phylogenetic relatedness humans, host
taxonomy human population within species range-which may reflect
human-wildlife contact. demonstrate bats harbour significantly higher
proportion zoonotic viruses mammalian orders. also identify 
the taxa geographic regions largest estimated number 'missing
viruses' 'missing zoonoses' therefore highest value future
surveillance. show phylogenetic host breadth viral traits 
are significant predictors zoonotic potential, providing novel framework 
assess newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.
