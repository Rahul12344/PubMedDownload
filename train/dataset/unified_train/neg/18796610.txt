monkeypox virus (mpv) virulent human pathogen gained increased
attention potential use bioterrorism agent inadvertent
introduction north america 2003. us outbreak also provided an
important opportunity study mpv-specific cell immunity. although
mpv-specific cd4(+) cd8(+) cells could recognize vaccinia virus
(vv)-infected monocytes produce inflammatory cytokines ifngamma and
tnfalpha, largely incapable responding autologous mpv-infected
cells. analysis revealed that, unlike cowpox virus (cpv), mpv not
interfere mhc expression intracellular transport mhc molecules.
instead, mpv-infected cells capable preventing cell receptor
(tcr)-mediated cell activation trans. ability trigger state of
nonresponsiveness represents unique mhc-independent mechanism blocking
antiviral cell activation inflammatory cytokine production likely an
important attribute involved viral dissemination infected host.
