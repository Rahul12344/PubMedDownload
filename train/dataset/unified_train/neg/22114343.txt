composed 35 amino acids, o3 smallest characterized protein encoded by
vaccinia virus (vacv) integral component entry-fusion complex
(efc). o3 conserved 100% identity orthopoxviruses except for
monkeypox viruses, whose o3 homologs 2 3 amino acid substitutions. since 
o3 part efc, high conservation could suggest immutable requirement
for interaction multiple proteins. chordopoxviruses genera also
encode small proteins characteristic predicted n-terminal Î±-helical
hydrophobic domain followed basic amino acids proline relative
genome location vacv o3. however, statistical significance of
their similarity vacv o3 low due large contribution the
transmembrane domain, small size, sequence diversity.
nevertheless, trans-complementation experiments demonstrated ability a
representative o3-like protein chordopoxvirus genus rescue the
infectivity vacv mutant unable express endogenous o3. moreover, 
recombinant viruses expressing o3 homologs place o3 replicated formed
plaques well nearly well wild-type vacv. o3 homologs expressed by
the recombinant vacvs incorporated membranes mature virions and,
with one exception, remained stably associated detergent-extracted and
affinity-purified efc. ability sequence-divergent o3 homologs to
coordinate function vacv entry proteins suggests conservation of
structural motifs. analysis chimeras formed swapping domains o3 with
those proteins indicated n-terminal transmembrane segment was
responsible efc interactions complementation infectivity.
