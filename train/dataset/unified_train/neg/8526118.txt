we investigated role blood dendritic cells (dc) transmission hiv-1
from infected uninfected cd4+ cells, accessory molecules involved.
dc promoted transmission infected uninfected cd4+ cells, blood dc
themselves infectable. dc-mediated transmission blocked mab to
cd4 mhc class ii, strongly increased mab cd40 dc cd28 t
cells. dc-dependent infection inhibitable anti-cd80 soluble
fusion protein cd80 ligand, ctla4; soluble ctla4ig also blocked infection 
augmented crosslinking cd40. also demonstrated mab cd40 up-regulate
the expression ctla4 ligands cd80 b70/b7-2 (cd86) dc. data
suggest dialog cd40-cd40 ligand (cd40l) cd28-cd80
counter-receptors dc cells may linked hiv infection vivo.
