during 2009-2010 northern hemisphere influenza season, seasonal and
pandemic influenza vaccines expected administered elderly people,
which important target group influenza vaccination. two multicentre
randomised clinical studies conducted participants aged ≥61 years to
assess immunogenicity reactogenicity following vaccination two doses
of as03-adjuvanted a(h1n1)pmd09 vaccine either sequentially administered 
(21 days first dose [n=73] 21 days second dose [n=72]) or
co-administered (first dose [n=84] second dose [n=84]) licensed
trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine (tiv). overall, 313 participants 2
centres sweden (clinicaltrials.gov, nct00968890) 6 centres germany
(nct00971425) randomised one four treatment groups. the
as03-adjuvanted a(h1n1)pmd09 vaccine elicited good immune response against
a(h1n1)pmd09-like virus treatment groups first second dose, 
meeting exceeding european licensing criteria pandemic influenza
vaccines. one dose as03-adjuvanted a(h1n1)pmd09 vaccine,
haemagglutination inhibition seroconversion rates ranged 85% (95% confidence
interval: 74-93%) 93% (85-97%), seroprotection rates 87% (76-94%) 96% 
(90-99%) geometric mean fold rise 15 (11-19) 20 (16-25). the
haemagglutination inhibition immune responses as03-adjuvanted a(h1n1)pmd09
vaccine seemed lower tiv administered 3 weeks before, immune
responses tiv seemed affected either vaccination schedule. solicited
symptoms frequently reported following administration the
as03-adjuvanted a(h1n1)pmd09 vaccine compared tiv, mainly mild 
to moderate intensity transient four treatment groups. these
results suggest sequential co-administration as03-adjuvanted
a(h1n1)pmd09 vaccine tiv induced good immune response vaccines 
had clinically acceptable safety profile people aged ≥61 years.
