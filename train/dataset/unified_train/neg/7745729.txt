the epstein-barr virus immediate-early protein bzlf1 mediates switch from
latent lytic infection. bzlf1 transcription derived either the
bzlf1 promoter brlf1 promoter (rp). productive viral infection of
ebv-infected b cells induced 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (tpa)
treatment, well cross-linking surface immunoglobulin with
antiimmunoglobulin antibody. tpa antiimmunoglobulin antibody known
to activate expression cellular transcription factor zif268 b cells. in
this study, examined regulation bzlf1 transcription zif268. 
show rp (but bzlf1 promoter) activated zif268. bacterially
synthesized zif268 binds strongly upstream sequence rp promoter
(located -131 -123 relative start site) weakly a
proximal sequence (-49 -40). zif268 activation rp requires two zif268
binding sites. tpa treatment b cells induces expression zif268 protein,
which binds rp. furthermore, tpa activation rp requires upstream zif268
site. findings indicate zif268 activate critical epstein-barr
virus immediate-early promoter and, therefore, may play key role the
regulation viral latency.
