background: intrarenal activation renin-angiotensin system been
suggested play pivotal role progression various renal diseases,
but regulation component fully clarified. we
investigated roles nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab) activation the
intrarenal renin-angiotensin system changes induced proteinuria.
methods: used unilaterally nephrectomized rats loaded bovine serum
albumin model proteinuric renal injury. renal nf-kappab activation was
inhibited gene transfer truncated form ikappabalpha via injection of
a recombinant adenovirus vector renal artery, reported previously.
results: inhibition renal nf-kappab activation attenuated increases in
intrarenal angiotensinogen protein (2.0-fold rats protein overloading and
saline injection 1.3-fold rats protein overloading injection 
truncated form ikappabalpha) angiotensin ii (1.8-fold 1.2-fold), and
angiotensinogen mrna. increases angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) and
angiotensin ii receptor type 2 unaffected nf-kappab inhibition. the
expression ace2, enzyme metabolizes angiotensins ii, was
decreased 37%, nf-kappab inhibition abolished decrease.
immunohistochemical analysis revealed angiotensinogen ace2
expression changes occurred mainly proximal tubule cells (i.e., target 
adenoviral gene transfer).
conclusion: results indicate proteinuria induces increase renal 
angiotensin ii nf-kappab-dependent manner. induction angiotensinogen and
decrease ace2 levels may involved nf-kappab-dependent increase in
angiotensin ii.
