hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural protein 3 (ns3) helicase essential 
viral replication. cloning human antibody fragments binding inhibiting
hcv helicase intracellularly (intracellular immunization) attempted. phage 
display system employed isolate human sfv fragments. large phagemid
library cloned patients infected hcv. phages expressing human sfv
fragments binding activity ns3 highly enriched affinity 
selection. selected sfv antibody fragments showed high affinity hcv helicase. 
the variable domains cloned antibody fragments sequenced their
germ-line origin determined. k(d) values describing affinity sfv ns3
were measured competition-eia. bacterially expressed recombinant human high
affinity antibodies used diagnostic therapeutic purposes. 
experiments select antibody fragments inhibiting ns3 helicase. employing
vectors transduction encoding cdna infected cells might a
novel gene therapy strategy intracellular immunization chronic hcv
infection.
