pregnancy outcomes, mother-to-child transmission (mtct) human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv), child mortality.
methods: total 884 hiv-infected pregnant women participating a
vitamin supplementation trial tanzania monitored assess pregnancy
outcomes child mortality. association outcomes maternal
vitamin status enrollment examined observational analysis.
results: association observed maternal vitamin status and
adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight preterm birth. in
multivariate models, low maternal vitamin level (<32 ng/ml) associated
with 50% higher risk (95% confidence interval [ci], 2%-120%) mtct hiv 
6 weeks, 2-fold higher risk mtct hiv breast-feeding among
children hiv uninfected 6 weeks (95% ci, 1.08-3.82), 46% higher
overall risk hiv infection (95% ci, 11%-91%). children born women a
low vitamin level 61% higher risk dying follow-up (95% ci,
25%-107%).
conclusions: found efficacious randomized trials, vitamin d
supplementation could prove inexpensive method reducing burden of
hiv infection death among children, particularly resource-limited
settings.
