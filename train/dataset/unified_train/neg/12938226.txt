theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (tmev) induces chronic demyelinating
disease central nervous system susceptible mice. resistance to
persistent tmev infection maps locus major histocompatibility
complex suggesting prominent role antiviral ctl protective immune
response. introduction d(b) gene fvb strain confers resistance to
this otherwise susceptible mouse line. infection fvb/d(b) mouse tmev 
provides model antiviral resistance determined response elicited 
by single class molecule. resistant mice h-2(b) haplotype mount a
vigorous h-2d(b)-restricted immunodominant response vp2 capsid protein. to
investigate extent contribution immunodominant cell
population resistance tmev, fvb/d(b) mice depleted vp2-specific
cd8(+) cells peptide treatment prior virus infection. peptide-treated
mice able clear virus developed extensive demyelination.
these findings demonstrate d(b)-restricted cd8(+) cells specific a
single viral peptide confer resistance tmev infection. ability to
manipulate cellular response provides model investigating the
mechanisms mediating protection virus infection cd8(+) cells.
