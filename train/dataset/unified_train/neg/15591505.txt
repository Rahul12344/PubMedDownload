background: several studies suggested chronic inflammatory bowel
disease may consequence antigen specific recognition appropriate t
cells expand induce immunopathology.
aims: wished investigate whether autoreactive cd4+ cells initiate the
disease recognition enterocyte specific antigens directly induction 
of mucosal tolerance occurs.
methods: transgenic mice (villin-ha) generated showed specific
expression haemagglutinin influenza virus exclusively enterocytes of
the intestinal epithelium. investigate impact enterocyte specific
haemagglutinin expression autoimmune environment, mated villin-ha mice
with cell receptor (tcr)-ha mice expressing alpha/beta-tcr, recognises
an mhc class ii restricted epitope haemagglutinin, analysed ha
specific cells induction autoimmunity tolerance.
results: villin-haxtcr-ha mice, incomplete central deletion ha specific
lymphocytes occurred. peripheral ha specific lymphocytes showed activated
phenotype increased infiltration intestinal mucosa, into
other organs double transgenic mice. enterocyte specific lamina propria
lymphocytes showed dose dependent proliferative response antigen stimulation
whereas proliferative capacity intraepithelial lymphocytes reduced.
mucosal lymphocytes villin-haxtcr-ha mice secreted lower amounts of
interferon gamma interleukin (il)-2 higher levels tumour necrosis
factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, il-6. mucosal immune
reactions accompanied broad changes gene expression profile with
expression proinflammatory genes, strikingly also remarkable set of
genes discussed context peripheral induction regulatory cells,
including il-10, nrp-1, foxp3.
conclusions: enterocyte specific antigen expression sufficient trigger a
specific cd4+ cell response leading mucosal infiltration. model,
progression overt clinical disease counteracted likely induction
of regulatory cells.
