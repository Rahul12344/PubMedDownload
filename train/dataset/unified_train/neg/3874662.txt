in order study pattern b cell involvement acute nonlymphocytic
leukemia (anll), multiple b lymphoid cell lines established epstein-barr 
virus transformation peripheral blood mononuclear cells two patients with
the disease heterozygous x chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (g6pd). one patient, progenitor cells involved the
leukemia exhibited multipotent differentiative expression, whereas other
patient cells showed differentiative expression restricted the
granulocytic pathway. patient whose abnormal clone showed multipotent
expression, ratio b-a g6pd b lymphoid cell lines skewed the
direction type b (the enzyme characteristic leukemia clone) and
significantly different 1:1 ratio expected. is, therefore, likely
that neoplastic event occurred stem cell common lymphoid series
as well myeloid series. contrast, evidence b cell involvement
was detected patient whose anll progenitor cells exhibited restricted 
differentiative expression. findings underscore heterogeneity anll. 
clinically morphologically similar malignancies two patients
originated progenitors different patterns stem cell differentiative
expression. difference may reflect differences cause pathogenesis.
