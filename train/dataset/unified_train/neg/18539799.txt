women significant risk heterosexually transmitted human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, mucosal epithelium cervix
and vagina serving major portal entry. cervicovaginal mucosa
naturally harbors dynamic microflora composed predominantly lactobacilli,
which may genetically modified serve efficient protective barrier
against heterosexual transmission hiv. selected vaginal strain of
lactobacillus, l. jensenii 1153, genetic modification display
surface-anchored anti-hiv proteins. genomic sequencing analyses revealed l. 
jensenii 1153 encodes several unique high-molecular-weight cell wall-anchored
proteins c-terminal cell wall sorting lpqtg motif. report, we
employed proteins express surface-anchored two-domain cd4 (2d cd4)
molecule l. jensenii 1153. studies indicated c-terminal cell wall
sorting signal lpqtg motif alone insufficient drive surface expression 
of heterologous proteins, display surface-anchored 2d cd4 molecules
required native sequences defined length upstream unique c-terminal
lpqtg cell wall sorting signal positively charged c terminus a
lactobacillus-based expression system. modified l. jensenii strain displayed 
2d cd4 molecules uniformly distributed bacterial surfaces. the
surface-anchored 2d cd4 molecule recognized conformation-dependent
anti-cd4 antibody, suggesting expressed proteins adopted native
conformation. establishment lactobacillus-based surface expression
system, potential broad applicability, represents major step toward
developing inexpensive yet durable approach topical microbicides the
mitigation heterosexual transmission hiv mucosally transmitted
viral pathogens.
