the hiv-1 regulatory proteins tat rev accessory proteins vpr, vpu and
vif essential efficient viral replication, cytoplasmic
production suggests processed recognition cytotoxic 
lymphocytes. however, limited data available, evaluating role of
immune responses directed proteins natural hiv-1 infection.
recent advances methods used characterization hiv-1-specific
cellular immune responses, including quantification antigen-specific ifn-gamma
production elispot assay flow-cytometry-based intracellular cytokine
quantification, allowed much comprehensive assessment of
virus-specific immune responses. emerging data show regulatory and
accessory proteins serve important targets hiv-1-specific cell
responses, multiple ctl epitopes identified functionally
important regions proteins. moreover, use autologous peptides
have allowed detection significantly stronger hiv-1-specific cell
responses variable regulatory accessory hiv-1 proteins tat and
vpr. data indicate despite small size proteins,
regulatory accessory proteins targeted cellular immune responses in
natural hiv-1 infection contribute importantly total hiv-1-specific
cd8+ cell response. multi-component vaccine, inclusion these
proteins plus structural proteins remains promising choice an
effective aids vaccine.
