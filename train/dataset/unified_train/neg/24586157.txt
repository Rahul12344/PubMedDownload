rna viruses take advantage cellular resources, membranes lipids,
to assemble viral replicase complexes (vrcs) drive viral replication. the
host lipins (phosphatidate phosphatases) particularly interesting because
these proteins play key roles cellular decisions membrane biogenesis
versus lipid storage. therefore, examined relationship host lipins
and tombusviruses, based yeast model host. show deletion pah1
(phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase), single yeast homolog the
lipin gene family phosphatidate phosphatases, whose inactivation is
responsible proliferation expansion endoplasmic reticulum (er)
membrane, facilitates robust rna virus replication yeast. document
increased tombusvirus replicase activity pah1δ yeast due efficient
assembly vrcs. show er membranes generated pah1δ yeast is
efficiently subverted rna virus, thus emphasizing connection 
host lipins rna viruses. thus, instead utilizing peroxisomal membranes
as observed wt yeast plants, tbsv readily switches vastly expanded 
er membranes lipin-deficient cells build vrcs support increased level
of viral replication. over-expression arabidopsis pah2p nicotiana
benthamiana decreased tombusvirus accumulation, validating findings 
also relevant plant host. over-expression atpah2p also inhibited the
er-based replication another plant rna virus, suggesting role of
lipins rna virus replication might include several eukaryotic viruses.
