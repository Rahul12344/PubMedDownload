background: antibodies liver-kidney microsome type 1 (anti-lkm-1), a
marker autoimmune hepatitis, found minority patients chronic 
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. whether interferon/ribavirin therapy safe
and effective patients unclear.
aim: describe prevalence, clinical features response to
interferon/ribavirin therapy anti-lkm-1 seropositive patients chronic
hepatitis c.
patients methods: anti-lkm-1 seropositive patients chronic hepatitis
c 1997 2002 underwent diagnostic liver biopsy liver
center maggiore hospital, milan, studied. serum hcv rna tested by
in-house pcr limit sensitivity 50 iu/ml. tissue antibodies were
assessed indirect immunofluorescence cryostat sections rat liver,
kidney stomach. liver biopsies graded staged ishak score.
autoimmune hepatitis defined according international autoimmune
hepatitis grading (iahg) score.
results: forty-eight (1.8%) 2675 hcv patients circulated anti-lkm-1 (30
females, 55 years age). twenty-eight genotype 2, 18 genotype 1, two
genotype 3. aminotransferase levels high 23 + 12 years, average. 
using iahg, autoimmune hepatitis excluded 44 patients (92%) found to
be probable 4 patients (8%). chronic hepatitis histologically mild 34
patients (70%), moderate severe 7 patients (15%) cirrhosis 7
patients (15%). sustained virological response (svr) achieved 20 
27 patients received interferon/ribavirin (13 genotype 2c 87% svr, 7
genotype 1b 58% svr). none patients serum aminotransferases,
immunoglobulins anti-lkm-1 levels flaring following therapy.
conclusions: lkm-1 antibodies rarely occur patients chronic hepatitis c
and predict autoimmune hepatitis, interferon/ribavirin hyporesponsiveness 
or immune-related reactions therapy.
