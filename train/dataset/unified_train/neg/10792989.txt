background aim: research hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection vivo has
been limited due absence suitable animal model. developed a
human-mouse radiation chimera normal mice, preconditioned lethal
total body irradiation radioprotected scid mouse bone marrow cells, 
permissive engraftment human hematopoietic cells solid tissues. this
resulting human-mouse model, comprises three genetically disparate sources 
of tissue, therefore termed trimera. study aimed assessing the
effect human il-6 hbv infection vivo trimera mice.
methods: trimera mice transplanted human liver tissue fragments with
hepg2-derived cell lines, previously infected ex vivo hbv 
the presence absence human interleukin-6 (hil-6) presence of
anti-il-6-neutralizing antibodies.
results: hbv sequences appeared sera animals liver tissue 
was incubated hbv hil-6 prior transplantation. similar result 
was obtained human hepatoblastoma cell line (hepg2), expressing hil-6 
receptor, infected ex vivo hbv presence hil-6 prior their
injection spleens trimera mice. however, liver fragments were
infected ex vivo simultaneously treated neutralizing antibodies 
hil-6 incubated hbv prior transplantation without hil-6, rate
of mice positive hbv dna sera lower. human mononuclear cells are
also permissive hbv infection vitro: presence hil-6 the
infection cells enhanced; infection suppressed the
chimeric protein named hyper-il-6, generated fusion hil-6 the
soluble hil-6 receptor (sil-6ralpha, gp80).
conclusion: hil-6 facilitates hbv infection vitro vivo.
