to study mechanisms involved membrane fusion, visualized fusion
process giant liposomes real time optical dark-field microscopy. to
induce membrane fusion, used (i) influenza hemagglutinin peptide (ha), 20-aa
peptide derived n-terminal fusion peptide region ha2 subunit, and
(ii) two synthetic analogue peptides ha, negatively (e5) positively (k5)
charged analogue. able visualize membrane fusion caused e5 k5
alone, well mixture two peptides. ha peptide however,
did induce membrane fusion, even acidic ph, described as
the optimal condition fusion large unilamellar vesicles. surprisingly,
before membrane fusion, shrinkage liposomes always observed. our
results suggest perturbation lipid bilayers, probably resulted
from alterations bending folds membranes, critical factor in
fusion efficiency.
