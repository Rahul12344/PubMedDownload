cronobacter sakazakii important foodborne pathogens causing rare but
life-threatening diseases neonates infants. crispr-cas system new
prokaryotic defense system provides adaptive immunity phages, latter
play vital role evolution pathogenicity host bacteria. this
study, found genome sizes c. sakazakii strains significant
positive correlation total genome sizes prophages. prophages contributed 
to 16.57% genetic diversity (pan genome) c. sakazakii, which
maybe potential virulence factors. subtype i-e crispr-cas system five
types crispr arrays found conserved site c. sakazakii strains. 
crispr1 crispr2 loci high variable spacers active showed
potential protection phage attacks. number spacers two active
crispr loci clinical strains significant less foodborne
strains, maybe reason clinical strains found prophages
than foodborne strains. frequently gain/loss prophages spacers in
crispr loci likely drive quick evolution c. sakazakii. study
provides new insight co-evolution phages c. sakazakii.
