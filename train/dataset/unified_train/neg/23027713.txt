objectives: use tenofovir highly associated emergence of
mutation k65r, confers broad resistance nucleoside/nucleotide analogue
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nrtis), especially tenofovir combined
with nrtis also selecting k65r. although recent hiv-1 treatment
guidelines discouraging combinations resulted reduced k65r selection
with tenofovir, updated information impact currently recommended
regimens population selection rate k65r presently lacking.
methods: study, evaluated changes time selection rate of
resistance mutation k65r large population 2736 hiv-1-infected patients
failing combination antiretroviral treatment 2002 2010.
results: k65r resistance mutation detected 144 patients, prevalence 
of 5.3%. large majority observed k65r cases explained use of
tenofovir, reflecting wide use clinical practice. however, changing
patterns time nrtis accompanying tenofovir resulted persistent
decreasing probability k65r selection tenofovir-based therapy. the
currently recommended nrti combination tenofovir/emtricitabine associated
with low probability k65r emergence. given dual nrti combination
including tenofovir, higher selection rates k65r consistently observed
with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease
inhibitor third agent.
discussion: finding stable time trend k65r despite elevated use of
tenofovir illustrates increased potency current hiv-1 therapy including
tenofovir.
