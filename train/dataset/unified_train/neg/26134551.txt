our study describes discovery series highly potent hepatitis c virus 
(hcv) ns5a inhibitors based symmetrical prolinamide derivatives benzidine
and diaminofluorene. modification benzidine, l-proline, and
diaminofluorene derivatives, developed novel inhibitor structures, which
allowed us establish library potent hcv ns5a inhibitors. optimizing
the benzidine prolinamide backbone, identified inhibitors embedding
meta-substituted benzidine core structures exhibited potent
anti-hcv activities. furthermore, battery studies including herg
ligand binding assay, cyp450 binding assay, rat plasma stability test, human
liver microsomal stability test, pharmacokinetic studies, identified
compounds 24, 26, 27, 42, 43 found nontoxic, expected be
effective therapeutic anti-hcv agents.
