mice inoculated replication-competent stocks murine acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (maids) virus severely immunocompromised proned
to development t- b-cell lymphomas. studied development of
t-cell lymphomas c57bl/6 rf/j mice inoculated helper-free stocks of
the maids defective virus. observed expansion cell clones (detected
by tcr gene rearrangements transplantation) rarely diseased
c57bl/6 mice slightly frequently rf/j mice. succeeded in
establishing four transplantable cell tumors malignant cell lines. the
three cell lines rf/j mice immature t-cells (thy-1+, cd3-, cd4+, cd8+, 
mac-1+), line c57bl/6 mouse phenotype mature
t-cells (thy-1+, cd3+, cd4+, cd8-). lines virus-producers despite the
fact helper-free stocks virus inoculated. helper mulvs
most likely originated endogenous mulv sequences. also, defective viral 
genome clearly detectable one cell line rearranged two other
lines. established cell lines may useful determine whether share
some characteristics anergic t-cells vivo study role 
of maids defective virus cell transformation.
