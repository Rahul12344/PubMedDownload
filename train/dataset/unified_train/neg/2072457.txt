the human t-cell leukemia virus type rex gene product plays critical role 
the expression retroviral structural proteins gag env from
incompletely spliced mrnas. rex protein acts cis element (rex-response 
element [rxre]) located u3/r region 3' long terminal
repeat present human t-cell leukemia virus type i-specific mrnas.
two domains predicted secondary structure rxre crucially
important rex action vivo measured two assay systems. vitro
studies using highly purified recombinant rex protein revealed specific and
direct interaction radiolabeled rxre sequences. correlation 
in vivo results direct binding rex protein mutant wild-type
rxre sequences supports existence predicted secondary structure
and importance direct interaction cis-acting rna sequence
for rex function vivo.
