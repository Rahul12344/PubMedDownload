the families viruses possessing single-stranded (ss) circular genome employ 
dedicated replication initiator protein (rep) making copies genome
through process rolling circle replication. replication begins at
conserved nonanucleotide sequence intergenic region. rep protein seems
to conserved amongst available proteins nanovirids and
comprises n-terminal endonuclease domain c-terminal helicase
domain. structural studies faba bean necrotic yellows virus endonuclease
domain suggests α + β fold comprising central β sheet built five
antiparallel β strands surrounded outer short α helices. catalysis is
mediated conserved tyr residue employs divalent metal ions (mn2+). on
one hand, reps associate oligomerize other
hand interact varied host vector associated proteins successful
infection. sequence analysis reps previously known nanovirids the
newly found ones metagenomics data shed light evolutionary pattern of
nanovirids comparison plant infecting ssdna viruses.
