this project addresses need provide visual context teach the
practical applications genome sequencing bioinformatics. present-day
research relies indirect visualization techniques (e.g., fluorescence-labeling
of dna sequencing reactions) sophisticated computer analysis. methods
are impractical prohibitively expensive laboratory classes. more
importantly, need curriculum resources visually demonstrate
the application genome sequence information rather dna sequencing
methodology itself. project computer-based lesson plan engages
students collaborative, problem-based learning. specific example focuses
on approaches human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) vaccine design based on
hiv-1 genome sequences using case study. students performed comparative
alignments variant hiv-1 sequences available public database. students 
then examined consequences hiv-1 mutations applying alignments to
three-dimensional images hiv-1 envelope protein structure, thus
visualizing implications applications vaccine design. lesson 
enhances problem solving application one type information
(genomic protein sequence) concrete visual conceptualizations. assessment
of student comprehension problem-solving ability revealed marked improvement 
after computer tutorial. furthermore, contextual presentation these
concepts within case study resulted student responses demonstrated
higher levels cognitive ability expected instructor.
