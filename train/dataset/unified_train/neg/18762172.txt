a sulfated polysaccharide, named fucoidan, marine alga cladosiphon
okamuranus comprised carbohydrate units containing glucuronic acid and
sulfated fucose residues. found compound potently inhibits dengue
virus type 2 (den2) infection. viral infection inhibited den2, not
other serotypes, pretreated fucoidan. carboxy-reduced fucoidan
derivative glucuronic acid converted glucose inhibit
viral infection. elimination sulfated function group fucoidan
significantly attenuated inhibitory activity den2 infection <1%
fucoidan. den2 particles bound exclusively fucoidan, indicating fucoidan 
interacts directly envelope glycoprotein (egp) den2. structure-based
analysis suggested arg323 den2 egp, conformationally proximal to
one putative heparin binding residues, lys310, critical the
interaction fucoidan. conclusion, sulfated group glucuronic 
acid fucoidan account inhibition den2 infection.
