an electron microscopic immunogold labelling technique employing monoclonal
antibodies applied antigenic analysis influenza b
viruses. reassortant influenza h3n2 viruses containing haemagglutinin molecules
from viruses isolated 1968 1982 analysed panel of
monoclonal antibodies raised viruses appeared period.
the immunogold labelling technique clearly demonstrated antigenic drift in
the haemagglutinin molecule occurred 1968 1982. the
technique applied examination viruses geographically
restricted influenza epidemic semi-closed community, antigenic variants were
found. furthermore technique enabled identification distinct antigenic
variant subpopulations within single clinical isolate. analysis ha of
mdck cell egg grown virus procedure provided data support the
hypothesis host cell exerts selective pressure subpopulations of
virus resulting emergence antigenic variants.
