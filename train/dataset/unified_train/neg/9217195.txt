the risk polytransfused patients hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection is
likely extend another recently identified member flaviviridae,
hepatitis g virus (hgv). investigated prevalence hgv 40 adult
italian patients transfusion-dependent thalassaemia evaluated the
clinical significance hgv infection. hgv-rna detected 9/40 patients
(22.5%). hgv infection significantly associated hcv viraemia (p =
0.0012), patients positive hgv also viraemic hcv. overall,
the clinical picture patients hcv/hgv co-infection different from
that patients isolated hcv. however, patients co-infected both
viruses lower values alanine-transferase (p = 0.035) lower titre 
hcv viraemia (p = 0.042) absence evident factors could
influence clinical expression hcv infection. conclusion, hgv highly 
prevalent among italian polytransfused patients. evidence clinically
significant pathogenic role hgv liver disease could found these
patients. subset cases possible interference hgv hcv infection 
was observed.
