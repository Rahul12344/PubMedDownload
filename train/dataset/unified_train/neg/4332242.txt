the 3'-terminal nucleosides high molecular weight rna c-type viruses.

maruyama hb, hatanaka m, gilden rv.

tumor virus rnas several mammalian one reptilian species purified; 
their 3'-terminal nucleoside identified separation trialcohols
produced periodate oxidation followed reduction tritiation with
nab(3)h(4). virus contained uridine predominant terminal nucleoside. 
molecular weight estimations based tritiation reactions consistent
with structure consisting four subunits.
