serial passage yellow fever virus (yf17d) mouse brain enhances
neurovirulence, causing reduction survival time intracerebral
inoculation adult mice. study biological genetic basis this
phenomenon, compared neurovirulence properties neuroadapted porterfield
strain (pyf) yf17d strain generated full-length yf cdna template
(yf5.2iv). adult mice infected olfactory bulb inoculation, results 
in widespread distribution virus throughout central nervous system.
although pyf yf5.2iv spread rapidly throughout neuraxis, maximal titres
of pyf brain spinal cord 1000- 10,000-fold higher those
of yf5.2iv. paralysis death occurred earlier pyf strain. several
cdna clones e/ns1 region pyf strain sequenced. three predicted
amino acid changes consistently observed envelope protein pyf 
strain compared yf5.2iv. common substitutions also identified ns1 
ns2a. potential contribution genetic differences neurovirulence
was evaluated generating recombinant, intertypic pyf/yf5.2iv viruses. physical
signs disease mean spinal cord titres inoculation one recombinant
were different yf5.2iv parent. data indicate pyf and
yf5.2iv differ significantly virulence properties, however, common amino
acid substitutions e/ns1 region pyf strain determine its
enhanced neurovirulence. regions viral genome may contribute
dominant effects virulence properties pyf strain.
