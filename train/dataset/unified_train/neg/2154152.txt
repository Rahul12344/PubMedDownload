in first three studies investigating widely held belief "milk
produces mucus," 60 volunteers challenged rhinovirus-2, daily
respiratory symptoms milk dairy product intake records kept a
10-day period. nasal secretion weights obtained weighing tissues
collected sealed immediately use. information obtained 51
subjects, yielding 510 person-days observation. subjects consumed zero 11
glasses milk per day (mean, 2.7; se, 0.08), secretion weights ranged 
zero 30.4 g/day (mean, 1.1; se, 0.1). response initial questionnaire,
27.5% reported practice reducing intake milk dairy products a
cold named milk dairy products bad colds. latter group, 80%
stated reason "producing mucus/phlegm." milk dairy product intake
was associated increase upper lower respiratory tract symptoms 
of congestion nasal secretion weight. trend observed cough, when
present, loose increasing milk dairy product intake; however, this
effect statistically significant 5% level. believe "milk
makes mucus" reduce milk intake colds reported significantly cough
and congestion symptoms, produce higher levels nasal
secretions. conclude statistically significant overall association can
be detected milk dairy product intake symptoms mucus
production healthy adults, either asymptomatic symptomatic, rhinovirus
infection.
