a defined vitro dna packaging system phage t3, composed of
purified proheads two packaging proteins, products genes 18 19
(gp18 gp19, respectively), displayed dna-dependent atpase activity. atp was
hydrolyzed adp pi. atpase activity stimulated nonpackageable
dna, single-stranded circular dna, rna (nonpac-atpase). among the
inhibitors dna packaging, actinomycin specifically inhibited atpase
activity tightly coupled dna packaging (pac-atpase), not
inhibit nonpac-atpase activity. activities depended upon functional
packaging complex, nonpac-atpase, activated, require dna.
unpackageable puc18 dna inhibited pac-atpase phage yield parallel.
approximately one molecule atp hydrolyzed translocation 1.8 
bp t3 dna.
