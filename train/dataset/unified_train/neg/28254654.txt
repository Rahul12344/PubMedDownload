a challenge protein based therapies ability produce biologically
active proteins ensured delivery. various approaches utilised
including fusion protein transduction domains protein biomolecule of
interest. compounding issue lack specificity, efficiency indeed
whether protein fusions actually translocated cell not
merely artefact fixation process. present novel platform,
allowing inducible export uptake protein interest. system
utilises combination tetracyline repressor system, combined a
fusion protein containing n-terminal signal peptide human chorionic
gonadotropin beta-subunit, c-terminal poly-arginine domain efficient
uptake target cells. novel platform validated using enhanced green
fluorescent protein gene interest. doxycycline efficiently induced
expression fusion protein. human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit
facilitated export fusion protein cell culture media.
finally, fusion protein able efficiently enter neighbouring cells
(target cells), mediated poly-arginine cell penetrating peptide.
importantly addressed issue whether observed uptake an
artefact fixation process indeed genuine translocation. addition
this platform provides number potential applications diverse areas such
as stem cell biology, immune therapy cancer targeting therapies.
