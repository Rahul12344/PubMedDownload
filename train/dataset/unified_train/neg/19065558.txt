indirect methods predict presence esophageal varices (ev) patients
with cirrhosis sensitive enough used surrogate endoscopy. 
we tested effectiveness liver stiffness measurement (lsm) transient
elastography presence insulin resistance (ir), marker associated
with fibrosis progression, noninvasive prediction portal hypertension. 
one hundred four consecutive patients newly diagnosed child hepatitis c
virus (hcv) cirrhosis underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy search for
ev. clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, ultrasonographic, metabolic
features, including ir homeostasis model assessment (homa), lsm by
transient elastography, recorded time endoscopy. evs detected
in 63 104 patients (60%). 10 patients (16%), evs medium-large
(>or=f2). multivariate analysis, presence evs independently
associated low platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (or, 0.998; 95% ci,
0.996-0.999) high homa-ir score (or, 1.296; 95%ci, 1.018-1.649), with
lsm (or, 1.009; 95%ci, 0.951-1.070). noteworthy nine ten patients
with medium-large evs platelet/spleen ratio less 792 homa-ir 
of greater 3.5. independent association low platelet
count/spleen diameter ratio (or, 0.998; 95%ci, 0.996-1.000), high homa-ir score
(or, 1.373; 95%ci, 1.014-1.859) presence ev confirmed subgroup 
of 77 nondiabetic subjects.conclusions: patients child hcv cirrhosis,
two simple, easy-to-get tests, namely platelet/spleen ratio insulin
resistance measured homa-ir, regardless presence diabetes,
significantly predict presence ev, outweighing contribution given by
transient elastography.
