foot-and-mouth disease (fmd) considered endemic ghana. however, our
knowledge local epidemiology disease restricted lack of
serological information data characterized viruses causing field
outbreaks. order improve understanding prevailing situation,
this study initiated establish fmd viruses (fmdv) circulating the
country. 2016, sera (n = 93) epithelia/oral swab (n = 20) samples were
collected cattle four districts southern ghana experienced fmd 
outbreaks. sera analyzed using priocheck® fmdv non-structural protein
(nsp) elisa whereas epithelia/oral swab samples examined virus
isolation, antigen elisa, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr), sequencing vp1 followed phylogenetic analysis. assay for
antibodies fmdv nsps provided evidence exposure fmdv 88.2%
(82/93) sera tested. serotypes viruses detected clinical
samples rt-pcr sequencing vp1. phylogenetic analysis vp1 coding
sequences revealed serotype viruses belonged west africa (wa)
topotype closely related viruses niger benin, the
serotype viruses clustered within genotype iv (g-iv) africa topotype and
were closely related viruses nigeria. study provides useful
information fmdv serotypes viral lineages circulate ghana west
africa may aid formulation effective fmd control strategies.
