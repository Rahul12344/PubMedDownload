porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) restricted cell
tropism prefers invade well-differentiated cells the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, pulmonary alveolar macrophages african
green monkey kidney cell line ma-104 derivatives, marc-145, vero 
and cl-2621. prrsv infection host cells actually receptor-mediated
endocytosis replication process. presence absence cellular
receptors decide whether cell lines permissive non-permissive prrsv
infection. several prrsv non-permissive cell lines, bhk-21, pk-15 and
cho-k1, shown become sensitive virus infection upon
expression recombinant receptor proteins. now, heparin sulfate,
sialoadhesin, cd163, cd151 vimentin identified important
prrsv receptors via involvement virus attachment, internalization or
uncoating. receptor characterized distribution different cells,
the function virus different infection stages interaction model with
the viral proteins genes. joint forces receptors recently attract
attentions due specific function. prrsv receptors become targets 
for designing new anti-viral reagents recombinant cell lines used 
isolating viruses developing effective vaccines due more
conserved sequences compared genetic variation virus. this
paper, role prrsv receptors molecular mechanism interaction
between virus receptors reviewed.
