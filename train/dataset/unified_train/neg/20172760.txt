background: according recent reports, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1)
induces bronchopneumonitis (bpn) immunocompetent patients undergoing prolonged
mechanical ventilation (mv), whose respiratory functions deteriorate poor 
outcome. hsv-1 bpn associated hsv symptomatic symptomless reactivation
in oropharynx.
objectives: sought systematically genetically characterize hsv-1
strains isolated immunocompetent patients receiving prolonged mv to
characterize genetic relationship strains sequentially isolated from
oropharyngeal samples (ops) broncho-alveolar liquids (bal) determine the
natural course hsv bpn.
study design: molecular epidemiological study, microsatellite technology 
was used determine genetic relationships 211 hsv-1 strains isolated
from ops and/or bal 106 patients receiving mv.
results: microsatellite haplotypes hsv-1 strains sequentially isolated from
the individual identical, hsv-1 isolates lung were
genetically indistinguishable strains isolated oral cavity. each
patient characterized hsv-1 microsatellite haplotype, no
nosocomial transmission strains patients observed.
conclusion: results demonstrate that, patients receive mv, hsv-1
pulmonary infection results reactivation genetically related hsv-1 in
the oropharynx, progressively infects lower respiratory tract.
