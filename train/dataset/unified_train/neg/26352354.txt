capillary electrophoresis based nucleic acid detection diagnosing human
infectious disease.

lian ds, zhao sj.

rapid transmission, high morbidity, mortality features human
infectious diseases caused microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, and
viruses. diseases may lead within short period time great personal 
and property losses, especially regions sanitation poor. thus, rapid 
diagnoses vital prevention therapeutic intervention human
infectious diseases. several conventional methods often used diagnose
infectious diseases, e.g. methods based cultures morphology, biochemical
tests based metabonomics. although traditional methods considered gold
standards used frequently, laborious, time consuming, and
tedious cannot meet demand rapid diagnoses. disease diagnosis using
capillary electrophoresis methods advantages high efficiency, high
throughput, high speed, coupled different nucleic acid detection
strategies overcomes drawbacks traditional identification methods,
precluding many types false positive negative results. therefore, this
review focuses application capillary electrophoresis based nucleic
detection diagnosis human infectious diseases, offers an
introduction limitations, advantages, future developments this
approach.
