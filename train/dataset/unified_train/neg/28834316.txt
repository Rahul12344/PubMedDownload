background: relationship silent cerebral infarcts (scis) history 
of parvovirus b19 (b19v) systematically evaluated. ancillary
study silent cerebral infarct trial (sit) (nct00072761), tested the
hypothesis history b19v infection associated increased
prevalence scis children sickle cell anemia.
procedure: used retrospective cross-sectional cohort study design; each
participant underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scan medical
record review prior b19v infection (n = 958).
results: sci present 30% (287 958) participants 17% (165 958)
had history b19v infection. based prior evidence low baseline
hemoglobin (hgb) levels associated increased odds sci, hgb levels
were divided tertiles (<7.6 g/dl, ≥7.6-≤8.5 g/dl, ≥8.6 g/dl) and
multivariable analysis used determine relationship joint
effect prior b19v infection, hgb levels, sci. prior b19v infection the
lowest hgb tertile associated increased risk sci (odds ratio [or]
2.12; 95% ci, 1.17-3.84; p = 0.013); prior b19v infection highest hgb 
tertile associated decreased risk (or 0.56; 95% ci, 0.38-0.84;
p = 0.004).
conclusions: efforts decrease incidence b19v infection, the
development b19v vaccine, may decrease sci prevalence.
