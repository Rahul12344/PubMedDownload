the neuraminidase influenza viruses target inhibitors
oseltamivir zanamivir. recent reports influenza viruses reduced
susceptibility neuraminidase inhibitors (nai) cause concern. several
amino acid substitutions, consequence one single nucleotide
mutation, known confer resistance nai. increase nai-resistant
viruses appears likely result wider application nai for
treatment prophylaxis seasonal influenza infections. monitoring the
occurrence spread resistant viruses important task. therefore,
rt-pcr assays developed subsequent pyrosequencing analysis (psq-pcr).
these assays allow rapid, high-throughput cost-effective screening of
subtype a/h1n1, a/h3n2, a/h5n1 viruses. various specimens respiratory
swabs, allantoic fluid, cell-propagated viruses used results are
available within hours. several a/h1n1, a/h3n2, a/h5n1 viruses isolated 
human avian specimens tested evaluate method. positive controls
encoding resistance-associated mutations created using site-directed
mutagenesis. results obtained controls showed assay can
discriminate clearly wild-type virus mutant virus. detection limit
of minor virus variants within viral quasispecies amounts 10%.
