background: dengue virus (denv) infections preferentially diagnosed by
detection specific igm antibodies, denv ns1 antigen assays amplification
of viral rna serum samples patients. type-specific immunity 
four worldwide circulating denv serotypes determined neutralization
assays. alternative complicated neutralization assays would helpful 
to study serotype-specific immune response people denv hyperendemic
areas also subjects upon denv vaccination.
methods: consecutive samples patients denv-1- 4 infection
type-specific antibodies detected using immune complex binding (icb)
elisa. incubation serum samples enzyme- labeled recombinant
envelope domain iii (ediii) antigens immune complexes (ics) formed, are
simultaneously bound solid phase coated fc-receptor (cd32). 
single washing procedure bound labeled ics determined. further
improve type-specific reactions high concentrations competing heterologous
unlabeled ed iii proteins added labeled antigens.
results: follow-up serum samples 64 patients rt-pcr confirmed primary
denv-1, -2, -3 -4 infections tested four enzyme-labeled
recombinant denv ediii antigens. antibodies ediii antigens found in
55 patients (sensitivity 86%). complete agreement serotype detected
by pcr early samples serotype-specific antibody later samples was
found. type-specific anti-ediii antibodies first detected 9-20 days after
onset disease. 21% samples collected people vietnam
secondary infections antibodies two serotypes could identified.
conclusions: data obtained icb-elisa show primary denv
infection corresponding type-specific antibodies detected almost all
samples collected least two weeks onset disease. method 
be value determine distribution various type-specific anti-denv 
antibodies denv endemic areas.
