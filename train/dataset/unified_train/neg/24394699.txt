human infection h7n9 influenza virus first identified china march
2013. 12 august 2013, total 135 documented cases 44 fatalities
had reported. genetic laboratory analyses novel h7n9 viruses
isolated patients indicate viruses possess several polymerase
gene mutations previously associated human adaptation potential pandemic
capabilities. however, function mutations emergence and
pathogenicity viruses well known. study, demonstrate
that pb2 e627k mutation, occurs 70â€Š% h7n9 patient
isolates, promotes replication h7n9 virus enhancing pb2 polymerase
activity enhances virulence mice. results show pb2 e627k mutation 
has played important role h7n9 influenza outbreak the
pathogenicity h7n9 virus.
