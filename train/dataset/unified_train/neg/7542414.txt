recent results implicated role vv k3l- e3l-encoded gene
products conferring vv ifn-resistant phenotype (beattie et al.,
virology 183, 419-422, 1991; beattie et al., j. virol. 69, 499-505, 1995). a
means establishing mechanisms functions mediate
this process vv-infected cells, assessed ifn phenotype 
k3l- (vp872) e3l- (vp1080) virus-infected cells. biochemical molecular
biological analyses performed comparing effects ifn wild-type as
well k3l- e3l- virus-infected cells. expression analyses k3l and
e3l gene products revealed evidenced virus-infected cells as
early 0.5 hr postinfection. e3l expression, however, appears prolonged,
in detectable 3 4 hr postinfection k3l was
undetectable 3 hr postinfection. despite similar expression profiles
at early times postinfection, pronounced sensitivity protein synthesis to
ifn observed 30 min postinfection vv k3l- virus-infected cells, whereas
ifn sensitivity observed vv e3l(-)-infected cells 2 hr
postinfection. subsequent analyses ifn-induced antiviral pathways in
vv-infected cells demonstrated k3l gene product contribute to
the previously identified specific kinase inhibitory factor (skif) activity but
does reduce level phosphorylated eif-2 alpha vv-infected cells.
interestingly, ifn-induced 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase-mediated antiviral
pathway active vv k3l(-)-infected cells wild-type
virus-infected cells. collectively results suggest k3l(-)- and
e3l(-)-encoded products abrogate antiviral effect ifn distinct levels.
