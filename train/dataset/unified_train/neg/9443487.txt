cerebellar disorders associated hiv infection typically result of
discrete cerebellar lesions resulting opportunistic infections as
toxoplasmosis progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy primary cns
lymphoma. clinical symptoms pathologic abnormalities related the
cerebellum may also observed hiv dementia. primary cerebellar
degeneration hiv previously reported. ten patients were
identified 8-year period five medical centers. patients had
clinical, laboratory, radiologic evaluations, three neuropathologic
examinations. patients presented progressively unsteady gait, slurred
speech, limb clumsiness. examination revealed gait ataxia, impaired limb
coordination, dysarthria, abnormal eye movements. cognition, strength, and
sensory function remained normal. cd4 lymphocyte counts varied 10 437
cells/mm3. neuroimaging studies showed prominent cerebellar atrophy.
neuropathology showed focal degeneration cerebellar granular cell layer
and unusual focal axonal swellings brainstem spinal cord. cultures,
histopathology, immunochemical studies showed conclusive evidence of
infection. report syndrome unexplained degeneration cerebellum
occurring association hiv infection.
