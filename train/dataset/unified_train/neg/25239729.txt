shorebirds primary reservoir avian influenza viruses (aiv). conducted
surveillance studies iceland shorebird populations 3 years, documenting
high serological evidence aiv exposure shorebirds, primarily ruddy
turnstones (arenaria interpres; seroprevalence=75%). however, little evidence 
virus infection found shorebird populations two turnstone
aivs (h2n7; h5n1) able phylogenetically examined. analyses
showed viruses iceland shorebirds primarily derived eurasian 
lineage viruses, yet h2 hemagglutinin gene segment north american 
lineage previously detected gull iceland previous year. h5n1
virus determined low pathogenic, however pb2 gene closely
related pb2 highly pathogenic h5n1 isolates china. multiple
lines evidence suggest turnstones infected least one

from different continents interact reassort, creating new virus genomes.
mounting data warrant continued surveillance aiv wild birds north
