we present genome organization molecular characterization three
formica exsecta viruses, along orf predictions, functional annotation of
genes. formica exsecta virus-4 (fev4; genbank id: mf287670) newly
discovered negative-sense single-stranded rna virus representing first
identified member order mononegavirales ants, whereas formica exsecta
virus-1 (fev1; genbank id: kf500001), formica exsecta virus-2 (fev2;
genbank id: kf500002) positive single-stranded rna viruses initially
identified (but characterized) earlier study. new virus fev4 was
found re-analyzing data study published earlier. formica exsecta
virus-4 genome 9,866 bp size, overall g + c content 44.92%, 
containing five predicted open reading frames (orfs). bioinformatics analysis
indicates gaps absent orfs complete, based our
comparative genomics analysis suggests genomes complete. following
the characterization, validate virus infection fev1, fev2 fev4 the
first time field-collected worker ants. colonies infected by
multiple viruses, viruses observed infect castes, and
multiple life stages workers queens. finally, highly similar viruses 
expressed adult workers queens six formica species: f. fusca, f. 
pressilabris, f. pratensis, f. aquilonia, f. truncorum f. cinerea. this
research indicates viruses shared ant species, further
studies viral transmission needed understand viral infection pathways.
