objective: objective obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic data for
acyclovir gravid women receiving herpes simplex virus suppressive therapy
with acyclovir prodrug valacyclovir.
study design: prospective, double-blind trial, 20 women history of
recurrent genital herpes simplex virus infection positive herpes simplex
virus 2 serologic results randomly assigned 36 weeks' gestation to
receive oral valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily) acyclovir (400 mg 3 times
daily). acyclovir pharmacokinetic profiles obtained initial dose
(36 weeks) steady state (38 weeks). amniotic fluid samples obtained
during labor simultaneous umbilical cord maternal plasma samples were
collected delivery. laboratory studies performed screen laboratory
evidence toxicity mothers infants.
results: peak acyclovir plasma concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation) 
higher valacyclovir recipients acyclovir recipients initial 
dose (3.14 +/- 0.7 microg/ml vs 0.74 +/- 0.6 microg/ml, p < .0001) steady 
state (3.03 +/- 1.0 microg/ml vs 0.94 +/- 0.7 microg/ml, p < .001). daily
area curve values higher valacyclovir recipients acyclovir
recipients initial dose (17.8 +/- 3.6 h x microg/ml vs 7.71 +/- 2.5 h x
microg/ml, p < .001) steady state (19.65 +/- 6.4 h x microg/ml versus 11.0
+/- 4.5 h x microg/ml, p = .009). significant difference drug
elimination half-life time peak concentration valacyclovir and
acyclovir recipients either sampling interval. acyclovir concentrated in
the amniotic fluid; however, evidence preferential fetal drug
accumulation (mean maternal/umbilical vein plasma ratios delivery 1.7 for
valacyclovir 1.3 acyclovir). valacyclovir well tolerated, no
significant laboratory clinical evidence toxicity detected.
conclusion: phase trial maternal valacyclovir therapy resulted in
higher plasma acyclovir levels, significantly higher peak concentrations and
daily area curve values, acyclovir therapy. additional trials 
are needed evaluate safety efficacy suppressive
valacyclovir therapy late pregnancy.
