natural killer (nk) cell function largely modulated growth factors and
cytokines. particular, interleukin (il)-2, il-12, il-15 major effects
on proliferative cytotoxic activities nk cells tumor and
virus-infected cells. thought members protein kinase c
(pkc) family serine/threonine kinases play important role mediating 
pleiotropic effects cytokines target cells. investigated 
downstream effects generated purified human nk cells il-2, il-12, il-15
on pkcalpha pkcepsilon--a canonical novel isoform pkc, respectively.
by means western blotting, pkc activity assays, immunofluorescence
performed highly purified preparations primary human nk cells, we
demonstrate that: 1) three cytokines similar effects pkcalpha and
pkcepsilon activities; 2) whereas pkcepsilon activity induced cytokine
stimulation, pkcalpha activity inhibited; 3) induction of
pkcepsilon inhibition pkcalpha functional activity relatively
early events nk cells, longer cytokine stimulations generate
significant variations enzyme activity, suggesting activation both
the canonical novel isoforms pkc events required early phases
of cytokine-induced nk cell stimulation.
