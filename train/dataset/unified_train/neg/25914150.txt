human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection occurs throughout body 
and dramatic physical effects, neurocognitive impairment 
central nervous system (cns). furthermore, examining virus resides in
the cns challenging due location done using samples
collected either autopsy, indirectly form cerebral spinal fluid (csf), 
through use animal models. unique milieu cns fosters viral
compartmentalization well evolution viral sequences, allowing new
cell types, macrophages microglia, infected. treatment must
also cross blood-brain barrier adding additional obstacles eliminating
viral populations cns. long-lived infected cell types treatment 
barriers may affect functional cure strategies people highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart).
