objectives: evaluate clinical rna load response antiretroviral therapy 
amongst patients infected hiv-2 study development drug
resistance.
methods: seven hiv-2 seropositive patients monitored clinical
examination, cd4 cell count hiv-2 viral rna load. viruses four subjects 
were genotyped vitro recovery virus co-cultivation pbmcs and
hvs t-cells attempted. viruses isolated two subjects assayed for
phenotypic antiviral resistance. main outcome measures relationship 
between disease stage, viral load, cd4 cell count, viral subtype clinical
course hiv-2 infection effect combination antiretroviral therapy on
disease progression, cd4 cell count, hiv-2 rna viral load drug resistance.
results: median time follow-up 3 years (range 0-8 years). three
patients aids, one symptomatic disease. four patients
genotyped, three infected hiv-2 subtype b one subtype a.
viraemia detectable cd4 counts less 300 x 10(6)/ml. two
patients high viral loads failed respond antiretroviral therapy
although treatment may optimal. one developed vitro
phenotypic antiviral resistance. genotype patient's viral reverse
transcriptase analysed.
conclusions: contrast hiv-1, hiv-2 rna levels often undetectable
despite advanced disease low cd4 cell counts. however, hiv-2 clearly
capable causing cd4 cell depletion resulting symptomatic disease. the
principles highly active antiretroviral therapy seem apply hiv-2 and
suboptimal therapy may lead drug resistance. timing therapy initiation,
monitoring response measurement resistance remain unresolved issues
and conclusions cannot extrapolated hiv-1.
