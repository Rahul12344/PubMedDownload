antrodia cinnamomea highly valued folk medicine used liver cancer, a
disease often caused long term infection hepatitis c virus (hcv). in
the present study, maleic succinic acid constituents (antrodins a-e) of
this medicinal fungus, vivo metabolites antrodin c analogue 
one metabolites tested inhibitory activity hcv protease.
most compounds showed potent inhibitory activity, antrodin being
the potent (ic(50) = 0.9 microg/ml). antrodin isolated one the
constituents a. cinnamomea also detected vivo metabolite of
the major constituent antrodin c. mode inhibition antrodin hcv
protease revealed lineweaver-burk plot competitive inhibition. 
results strongly support use folk medicine liver cancer hcv
infection global problem.
