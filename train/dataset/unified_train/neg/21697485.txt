enterovirus 71 (ev71) causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease neurological
complications young children. although underlying mechanisms remain
obscure, impaired aberrant immunity thought play role. infected
cells, ev71 suppresses type interferon responses mediated retinoid
acid-inducible gene (rig-i). involves ev71 3c protein, disrupts 
the formation functional rig-i complex. present study, report that
ev71 inhibits induction innate immunity toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) via
a distinct mechanism. hela cells stimulated poly(i · c), ev71 inactivates
interferon regulatory factor 3 drastically suppresses interferon-stimulated
gene expression. notably, ev71 specifically downregulates trif, tir
domain-containing adaptor inducing beta interferon (ifn-β). expressed alone 
in mammalian cells, ev71 3c capable exhibiting activities. ev71 3c
associates induces trif cleavage presence z-vad-fmk, caspase
inhibitor. trif cleavage depends amino acid pair q312-s313, which
resembles proteolytic site picornavirus 3c proteases. further, site-specific
3c mutants defective protease activity bind trif fail mediate trif 
cleavage. consequently, 3c mutants unable inhibit nf-κb ifn-β
promoter activation. trif cleavage mediated ev71 may mechanism impair 
type ifn production response toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) activation.
