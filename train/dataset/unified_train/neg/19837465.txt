hiv-1 infections resulting aids pandemic remain global challenge the
absence protective vaccine rapid selection drug-resistant 
viral variants response currently available antiviral therapies. the
development new highly active antiviral agents would greatly facilitate
effective clinical management hiv-1 infections delay onset aids.
recent advances understanding intracellular immunity conferred host 
cytidine deaminases apobec3g (a3g) apobec3f (a3f) mechanism 
the virally encoded virion infectivity factor (vif) protein induces their
proteasomal degradation provide fresh opportunities development novel 
antiviral treatments. interestingly, vif-a3g vif-a3f interactions that
overcome host defense mechanism structurally distinct provide two
potential targets antiviral drug development. review provides an
overview current knowledge apobec3-vif interactions recent efforts to
target interactions antiviral drug development.
