islet transplantation promising treatment type 1 diabetes, need
for chronic immunosuppression major hurdle broad applicability. ex vivo
introduction agents lentiviral vectors-improving beta-cell resistance
against immune attack-is attractive path pursue. aim study 
to investigate whether dissociation islets single cells prior viral
infection reaggregation transplantation would improve viral
transduction efficacy without cytotoxicity. procedure improved transduction 
efficacy lv-pwpt-cmv-egfp construct 11.2 +/- 4.1% moi 50 whole 
islets 80.0 +/- 2.8% moi 5. viability (as measured hoechst/pi) and
functionality (as measured glucose challenge) remained high. after
transplantation, transfected pseudoislet aggregates remained egfp positive
for 90 days expression egfp colocalized primarily the
insulin-positive beta-cells. increased vulnerability immune attack was
observed vitro vivo. data demonstrate dispersion islets
prior lentiviral transfection reaggregation prior transplantation 
highly efficient way introduce genes interest islets for
transplantation purposes vitro vivo, amount beta-cells
needed normalization glycemia eightfold higher using
dispersed cell aggregates versus unmanipulated islets. high price pay to
reach stable strong transgene expression islet cells certainly an
important cell loss.
