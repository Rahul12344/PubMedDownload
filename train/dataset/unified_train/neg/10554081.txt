alloimmune antiphospholipid antibodies react phospholipids an
epiphenomenon infectious disease. autoimmune antiphospholipid
antibodies recognise phospholipid-protein complexes proteins, beta2
glycoprotein prothrombin related clinical features the
antiphospholipid syndrome. lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies,
antiprothrombin, anti-beta2 glycoprotein antibodies studied 61
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) patients, 55 syphilis patients, 45
selected patients antiphospholipid syndrome. lupus anticoagulant present
in 72% hiv 81% antiphospholipid syndrome patients. none syphilis
patients lupus anticoagulant. anticardiolipin antibodies found at
comparable prevalence three groups (hiv 67%, syphilis 67%,
antiphospholipid syndrome 84%). hiv frequently anti-beta2 glycoprotein i
(13%) antiprothrombin (12%) antibodies syphilis (0 4%,
respectively), significantly less antiphospholipid syndrome (61 40%,
respectively). autoimmune antiphospholipid antibodies hiv without clinical
features antiphospholipid syndrome might reflex immunological
chaos and/or constant antigenic virus stimulus.
