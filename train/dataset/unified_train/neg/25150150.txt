hepatitis b virus (hbv) continues serious worldwide health problem
despite use protective hbv vaccines therapeutic regimens against
chronic hbv infection. chronic hbv patients cannot induce sufficient immune
responses virus. hbv antigens believed suppress immune
responses chronic infection. hence, studying role hbv immune
suppression important development alternative therapeutic
strategies hbv infections. present study, investigated effect
of hepatitis b virus e antigen (hbeag) generation bone marrow derived
dendritic cells (bmdcs) stimulation plasmacytoid dcs (pdcs). the
presence hbeag, ratio bmdcs decreased, ratio of
cd11b(+)ly6g(+) immature myeloid cells increased. expression 47
proteins also changed hbeag treatment; however, cpg-induced mhc-ii
expression pdcs affected. results indicate hbeag may a
negative effect generation dcs bone morrow precursors.
