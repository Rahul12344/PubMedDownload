the regulation human papillomavirus (hpv) late gene expression difficult to
analyse late proteins l1 l2 produced upper layers
of terminally differentiated keratinocytes. however, minor capsid protein
l2 hpv types 1, 6, 11 16, rare mrnas cdnas starting 3' e5 open
reading frame (orf) previously described. order analyse whether the
dna region preceding late orfs (late upstream region, lur) hpv-16 and
hpv-18 promoter activity, transient transfection assays employing luciferase 
reporter constructs performed. results show lur hpv-16 and
hpv-18 exhibits orientation-dependent promoter activity different cells. by
analysing 3'-deletion mutants hpv-16 lur, identified 78 bp within the
sequence e5 l2 orfs critical promoter activity.
furthermore, analysis 5'-deletion mutant revealed negative
cis-regulatory element located within e2 orf. hpv-16 early poly(a) signal
is located downstream critical promoter region. inactivation this
element site-directed mutagenesis strongly enhanced luciferase activity.
however, mutation two potential tata-binding protein (tbp) sites located
within critical promoter region abolish activity. altogether,
these data indicate possibility tata-less promoter hpv-16 and
hpv-18 lurs. together early poly(a) signal, potential promoter
might involved differentiation-dependent regulation late gene
expression.
