the lytic gene expression several members human herpesvirus family 
been profiled using gene-expression microarrays; however, lytic cascade of
roseoloviruses studied similar depth. based complete dna
genome sequences human herpesvirus 6 variant (hhv-6a) variant b
(hhv-6b), constructed cdna microarray containing dna probes their
predicted open reading frames, plus 914 human genes. gene-expression profiling of
hhv-6b strain z29 supt1 cells 60 h time-course post-infection, together
with kinetic classification hhv-6b genes presence either
cycloheximide phosphonoacetic acid, allowed placement hhv-6b genes into
defined kinetic classes. eighty-nine hhv-6b genes divided four
different expression kinetic classes: eight immediate-early, 44 early, 33 late
and four biphasic. clustering genes similar expression profiles implied a
shared function, thus revealing possible roles previously uncharacterized
hhv-6b genes.
