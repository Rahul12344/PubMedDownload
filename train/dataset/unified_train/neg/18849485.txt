the use antiretroviral therapy hiv type 1 (hiv-1)-infected patients does
not lead virus eradication. due, significant degree, fact 
that hiv-1 establish highly stable reservoir latently infected cells. in
this work, describe ex vivo experimental system generates high levels 
of hiv-1 latently infected memory cells using primary cd4+ cells. using this
model, able dissect cell-signaling pathways characterize 
the long terminal repeat (ltr) cis-acting elements involved reactivation of
hiv-1 memory cd4+ cells. conclude lck nuclear factor of
activated cells (nfat), nf-kappab, required optimal latent
virus reactivation memory cells. also found cis-acting elements 
which critical toward hiv-1 reactivation sp1 kappab/nfat
transcription factor binding sites.
