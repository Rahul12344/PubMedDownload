nuclear receptors represent key regulators cell proliferation,
differentiation, development. demonstrate nuclear orphan
receptor tr4 highly expressed hematopoietic cells tissues have
analyzed impact tr4 cell compartment. show tr4, when
ectopically expressed bone marrow cells via retrovirus vector, promotes
proliferation myeloid progenitor cells. cells represent promyelocytes as
judged morphological features, expression cell surface molecules, and
specific markers like mim-1 caat/enhancer binding protein beta. also
demonstrate growth promoting activity tr4 exclusively
dependent association dna, expression mutated tr4
version devoid dna binding domain exhibits similar proliferative
potential wild-type tr4. conclusion, data position orphan
receptor tr4 important regulator myeloid progenitor cell proliferation
and development.
