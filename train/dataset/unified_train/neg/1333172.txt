to determine potential sexual transmission hepatitis c virus
(hcv), specifically studied cohort 42 young adults (median age, 39 yr)
with chronic hcv infection stable sexual partners. hcv assays 
supplemented four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay, 39 42
partners tested hcv rna nested polymerase chain reaction. ninety 
percent partners reported frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with
the index patients. two 42 partners tested positive anti-hcv antibody 
and hcv rna positive; one independent risk factors viral
hepatitis. therefore, one 41 partners, (2.4%; 95% ci, 0.6-12.9%) without
independent risk factors hcv anti-hcv positive. woman one of
five partners (20%; 95% ci, 1-66%) reported frequent razor-sharing the
index patient. partner frequently sustained skin lacerations, bleeding, 
secondary shared razor blade. conclude heterosexual transmission 
of hepatitis c extremely uncommon, despite frequent unprotected sexual
intercourse.
