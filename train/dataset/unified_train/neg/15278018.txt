severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) caused newly identified
coronavirus, called sars-associated coronavirus (sars-cov) appears be
transmitted primarily droplets saliva. reason most
important international organizations recommend dentists adopt unique 
preventive approach problem: sars patients treated the
dental office. possible suspected case sars correctly and
promptly identified. correct identification made difficult several
factors, incubation period, possibly asymptomatic onset the
illness, still low specificity sensitivity laboratory instrumental
tests. case suspected case sars may thus unwillingly treated the
dental office. therefore necessary adopt protective measures the
dental personnel implement enforce infection control measures order
to eliminate risk viral contamination. nonetheless, procedures do
not ensure complete elimination sars-cov contamination risk since major
risk represented blood-borne infection, originated mouth of
patients, contamination dental units water lines (duwls) most
difficult control. blood-borne contamination may achieved adopting 
a high level, between-patients disinfection protocol duwls based the
use chemical agents biocidal activity spores, viruses, bacteria
and fungi (autosteril method). conclusion fully effective control the
cross-infection risk obtained adopting correct, integrated use 
of different infection control procedures.
