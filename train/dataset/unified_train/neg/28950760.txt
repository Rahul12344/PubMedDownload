a rapid reliable influenza method important meet diagnostic needs.
here, performance cartridge-based xpert flu assay evaluated in
comparison in-house real-time pcr method. analysis decentralized
from clinical microbiology laboratory located county hospital ryhov,
jönköping, sweden, clinical chemistry laboratories present three
hospitals region jönköping county, allowing 24/7 service. total, 189
clinical samples included 2014-2015. overall sensitivity and
specificity xpert flu 99%. xpert flu 24/7 service the
median turn-around time sampling available test result decreased from
22 h 2013 1.9 h 2015. summary, analytical performance xpert
flu excellent. large degree automation genexpert xpert flu 
assay demand allowed 24/7 service clinical chemistry laboratories
in county, significantly reduced turn-around time, valuable
