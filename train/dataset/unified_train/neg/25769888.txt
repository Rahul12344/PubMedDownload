diagnosing asymptomatic neurosyphilis (ans) hiv-infected patients is
difficult. recent report suggested cxcl13 promising diagnostic marker
for neurosyphilis hiv-positive patients. however, whether cxcl13 a
diagnostic marker ans hiv-infected patients remains unknown. purpose
of study determine role cxcl13 diagnosing ans in
hiv-infected patients. study comprised two study three control groups.
two study groups included 12 hiv-infected patients ans 25 patients 
syphilis hiv co-infection (without ans). three control groups included 9
patients ans without hiv infection, 25 hiv-infected patients without
syphilis 10 healthy volunteers. concentrations csf cxcl13 measured
before neurosyphilis therapy. results showed csf cxcl13
concentrations significantly increased hiv-infected patients
with ans, 25 hiv patients syphilis 9 ans patients without hiv,
but patients two control groups. csf cxcl13
concentrations declined two study groups patients following
neurosyphilis therapy. therefore, csf cxcl13 concentrations could improve the
diagnosis ans hiv-infected patients.
