a series dialkyl esters purine pyrimidine n-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]
derivatives substituted position 2, 6, 8 purine base position 2, 
4, 5 pyrimidine base prepared alkylation appropriate
heterocyclic base 2-chloroethoxymethylphosphonate diester presence of
sodium hydride, cesium carbonate, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5,4, 0]undec-7-ene (dbu) in
dimethylformamide. additional derivatives obtained transformations of
the bases suitably modified intermediates bearing reactive functions at
the base moiety. diesters converted corresponding monoesters by
sodium azide treatment, free acids obtained diester by
successive treatment bromotrimethylsilane hydrolysis. none pme
derivatives pyrimidine series, 6-aza 3-deaza analogues, exhibited
any activity dna viruses retroviruses tested, except the
5-bromocytosine derivative. substitution adenine ring pmea position 
2 cl, f, oh group decreased activity dna viruses tested.
pmedap highly active hsv-1, hsv-2, vzv concentration range
(ec50) 0.07-2 microg/ml. also 2-amino-6-chloropurine derivative was
strongly active (ec50 = 0.1-0. 4 microg/ml) herpes simplex viruses and
(ec50 = 0.006-0.3 microg/ml) cmv vzv. pmeg active
compound whole series dna viruses (ec50 approximately 0.01-0.02
microg/ml), though exhibited significant toxicity host cells. 
base-modified compounds show appreciable activity dna viruses
except 7-deazapmea (ic50 approximately 7.5 microg/ml) hiv-1 msv. 
the neutral (diisopropyl, diisooctyl) diesters pmea active cmv
and vzv, corresponding monoesters inactive. diisopropyl ester 
of 2-chloroadenine analogue pmea showed substantially (10-100x) higher
activity cmv vzv parent phosphonate. also, diisopropyl
and diisooctyl ester pmedap inhibited cmv vzv, esterification the
phosphonate residue improve activity either msv hiv.
