our objective determine whether cell-associated herpesvirus vaccines
used chickens control marek's disease tumors augment development of
lymphoid leukosis (ll) induced exogenous avian leukosis virus (alv). various
single mixed marek's disease vaccines inoculated day 1, alv was
injected 1 10 days, chickens several experimental commercial
strains. development monitored 16 48 weeks various
experiments. several strains chickens repeatedly found widely
used serotype 3 turkey herpesvirus vaccine augment comparison 
unvaccinated controls. however, development incidence prominently
augmented several chicken strains vaccinated serotype 2 vaccines, used
alone mixtures serotypes. one chicken strain, augmentation
was demonstrated natural exposure alv serotype 2 marek's disease
virus viremic shedder chickens. augmentation virulent attenuated
marek's disease viruses serotype 1 intermediate effect. serotype 2
marek's disease virus augmentation prominent three laboratory lines 
and one commercial strain white leghorns, observed an
ll-resistant laboratory line four commercial strains susceptible alv
infection. chickens developed similar levels viremia neutralizing
antibodies alv regardless presence augmentation ll, suggesting
that mechanism enhanced result differences in
susceptibility immune response alv. postulate serotype 2
herpesviruses may augment one several possible influences bursal
cells subsequently transformed exogenous alv.
