unlike beta-related phages isolated corynebacterium diphtheriae, phage 
782 readily plaqued strains c. ulcerans c. pseudotuberculosis. the
extended host range phage 782 not, however, due greater ability of
the phage absorb bacterial surfaces. using chemical mutagenesis, number
of phage mutants isolated diminished capacities infect c.
ulcerans, suggesting existence locus (ehr) extended host range.
pre-lysogenization c. ulcerans strains phage 782, mutant form
or beta-related phages, rendered susceptible infection by
previously excluded phages. examination recombinant phages 782,
pie, beta localized ehr 7 kilobase region dna including attp. the
data compatible notion ehr encodes anti-restriction
function.
