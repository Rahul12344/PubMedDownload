objectives: study carried evaluate risk factors associated
with chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection.
methods: case-control study used multiple logistic regression analysis to
determine risk factors associated hcv infection. study participants were
followed 10 liver gastroenterologic units included 294 subjects with
chronic hcv infection 295 age sex matched anti-hcv-negative controls.
results: use glass syringes surgical procedures reported as
many 77.6% 73.8% cases, respectively; blood transfusion recorded in
nearly quarter cases; 10.2% cases, none controls, reported
past current intravenous drug use. multiple logistic regression analysis
showed blood transfusion, sexual partner intravenous drug
user, surgery independent predictors likelihood hcv
infection.
conclusions: findings indicate that, besides well-known sources of
infection, blood transfusion intravenous drug use, surgical
procedures may play important role spread hcv infection italy.
given large proportion general population undergoes surgery, a
rational relatively inexpensive policy prevention hcv infection
must focus implementing efficient procedures sterilization of
instruments use disposable materials surgical units.
