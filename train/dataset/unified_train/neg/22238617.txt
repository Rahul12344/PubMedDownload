influenza viral polymerase heterotrimeric complex consists pa,
pb1, pb2 subunits. previously reported di-codon substitution
mutation (g507a-r508a), denoted j10, c-terminal half pa apparent
effect viral rna synthesis prevented infectious virus production,
indicating pa may novel role independent polymerase activity. 
to examine roles pa viral life cycle, generated
and characterized additional mutations regions flanking j10 site from
residues 497 518. tested di-codon mutations completely abolished or
significantly reduced viral infectivity, disparate
mechanisms. several showed effects resembling j10, mutant
polymerase supported normal levels viral rna synthesis nonetheless failed 
to generate infectious viral particles. others eliminated polymerase activity, in
most cases perturbing normal nuclear localization pa protein cells. 
we also engineered single-codon mutations predicted pack near the
j10 site crystal structure pa, found altering residues k378 or
d478 produced j10-like phenotype. studies j10 itself, we
found mutation affect formation release virion-like
particles per se, instead impairs ability particles to
incorporate eight essential rna segments (vrnas) make the
viral genome. taken together, analysis identifies mutations c-terminal
region pa differentially affect least three distinct activities:
protein nuclear localization, viral rna synthesis, trans-acting function
that required efficient packaging eight vrnas.
