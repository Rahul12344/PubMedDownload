over last decade previously unappreciated mechanism gene regulation 
been uncovered mediated large class small noncoding rnas known as
micrornas (mirnas), mechanism utilized organisms ranging from
plants humans. mirnas important downregulators gene expression 
seen dysregulated disease development. thus inhibition aberrantly
upregulated mirnas therapeutic approach become promising field.many
models mirna inhibitors currently exist, decoy models most
successful current research. promising inhibition model tough decoy
(tud) rnas inhibitor, uses antisense sequences bind target mirnas,
preventing binding endogenous targets. since tud
inhibitors ability successfully used vitro vivo studies,
this covetable inhibition method. chapter, introduce to
design generate mirna tough decoy inhibitors adeno-associated viral
construct. tud inhibitors two mirna binding sites. tud include
stem sequences, mirna binding site, linkers. vitro validation
experiments confirm effectiveness tud inhibit mirna are
described. also propose practical approaches making tud mirna
of interest. hope chapter facilitates readers create simpler method 
to generate tud used mirna loss function studies.
