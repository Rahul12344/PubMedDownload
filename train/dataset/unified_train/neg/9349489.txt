a gene encoding capsid-associated viral structural protein identified 
and sequenced genome choristoneura fumiferana multicapsid
nucleopolyhedrovirus (cfmnpv). gene 1872 nucleotide open reading frame 
(orf) encoding 624 amino acids predicted molecular mass 71.4 kda.
transcription, appeared initiated conserved gtaag motif of
baculovirus late genes, detected 12 h, reached maximum 48 h and
declined 72 h post-infection (p.i.). part orf cloned frame 
a prokaryotic expression vector, pmal-c2, fusion protein used to
generate antibodies rabbits. shown, aid polyclonal
antiserum, viral protein detectable 24 h p.i. infected cells.
the protein appeared 82 kda band occlusion-derived virus 82
kda band 72 kda band budded virus. amino acid sequence comparisons
revealed orf high homology orf p87 (77% similarity) of
orgyia pseudotsugata (op) mnpv orf p80 (60% similarity) autographa
californica (ac) mnpv. immunoblots confirmed cfmnpv protein had
antigenic similarities p87 protein opmnpv, p80 of
acmnpv.
