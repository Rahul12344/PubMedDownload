natural killer (nk) cells innate lymphocytes display features of
adaptive immunity viral infection. biallelic mutations irf8 been
reported cause familial nk cell deficiency susceptibility severe viral 
infection humans; however, precise role transcription factor in
regulating nk cell function remains unknown. here, show cell-intrinsic
irf8 required nk-cell-mediated protection mouse cytomegalovirus
infection. viral exposure, nk cells upregulated irf8 through
interleukin-12 (il-12) signaling transcription factor stat4, which
promoted epigenetic remodeling irf8 locus. moreover, irf8 facilitated 
proliferative burst virus-specific nk cells promoting expression of
cell-cycle genes directly controlling zbtb32, master regulator of
virus-driven nk cell proliferation. findings identify function and
cell-type-specific regulation irf8 nk-cell-mediated antiviral immunity 
provide mechanistic understanding viral susceptibility patients irf8
mutations.
