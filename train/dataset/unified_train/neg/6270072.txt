rna polymerase influenza virus. i. comparison virion-associated rna
polymerase activity various strains influenza virus.

kawakami k, ishihama a, hamaguchi m.

a systematic comparative study performed polypeptide composition
and rna polymerase activity associated virions various strains of
influenza virus, including four human two avian viruses. significant
differences found molecular weights hemagglutinin (ha)
but also nucleoprotein (np) membrane protein (m), determined by
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis denaturing conditions. results
indicate that, among viruses sharing serotype determined surface 
proteins ha na (neuraminidase), considerable variations exist the
structure viral proteins, including inner proteins. relative contents of
viral proteins also varied among strains grown similar conditions.
the total content three p proteins, putative rna polymerase subunits, 
within range 1.1 2.2% total viral proteins roughly
paralleled virion-associated rna polymerase activity. virion-associated
rna polymerase strains tested stimulated dinucleotide
primers, apg gpg, indicating specificity transcription initiation 
is conserved among wide varieties influenza virus.
