the association recent zika virus (zikv) infection neurological

underscores necessity protective vaccine. rational vaccine development 
requires in-depth understanding mechanisms could protect 
infection virus. however, far, analysis hampered by
the absence suitable small animal model. unlike situation humans,
zikv replicates effectively peripheral organs mice, type ifn 
signaling interrupted. type ifn also impacts adaptive immune

immunological analysis. report, show even wild-type (wt) mice 
i.c. infection low doses virus causes marked local virus replication 
lethal encephalitis naïve mice. furthermore, peripheral infection wt mice
with low doses virus induces significant immune response, provides
long-lasting protection wt mice fatal outcome subsequent i.c.

represents new approach studying adaptive immune response zikv in

mechanisms underlying resistance reinfection. using combination adoptive 
transfer, antibody-based cell depletion, gene targeting, show key
protective factor type ifn replete mice humoral immunity. cd8 cells are
not essential mice preformed specific antibodies, conditions
where initial antibody levels low, effector cd8 cells may play role

of natural immunity zikv infection zika vaccine design.
