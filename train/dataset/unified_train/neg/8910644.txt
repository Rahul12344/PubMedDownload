virus infection usually alters host cell shuts synthesis of
cellular macromolecules. order screen upregulated cellular transcripts 
during pseudorabies virus (prv) infection, employed mrna differential
display technique. screen based positive selection mrna level
for genes expressed normal cells increased corresponding prv-infected
cells. 14000 species mrna, isolated mock-infected prv-infected
madin-darby bovine kidney cell 1 h post infection, screened, 40
candidate clones recovered. southern blot analysis revealed 17 of
40 candidate clones, enhanced prv-infected cells. partial dna sequences
demonstrated 17 clones distinct cellular genes, including those
encoding modulators signal transduction (saposin, 14-3-3, adenylate
kinase, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase c-alpha), encoding components 
of translation (fau, ribosomal proteins s11, l31, l36), cellular genes
(peptidase, cyclin e, rch1, oligo-c-rich single-stranded nucleic acid binding
protein, rap, arginyl-trna synthetase), two unknown genes. thus, study
identifies successfully transcriptionally regulated cellular genes 
associated prv infection. furthermore, study provides support the
use mrna differential display method rapidly isolate differentially
expressed genes virus infection.
