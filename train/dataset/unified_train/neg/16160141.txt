the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) envelope glycoproteins (envs)
function trimer, mediating virus entry promoting fusion viral 
and target cell membranes. hiv-1 env trimers induce membrane fusion a
ph-independent pathway driven interaction env trimer its
cellular receptors, cd4 ccr5/cxcr4. studied viruses mixed
heterotrimers wild-type dominant-negative envs determine number (t)
of env trimers required hiv-1 entry. surprise, found single 
env trimer capable supporting hiv-1 entry; i.e., = 1. similar approach 
was applied investigate entry stoichiometry envelope glycoproteins from
amphotropic murine leukemia virus (a-mlv), avian sarcoma/leukosis virus type a
(aslv-a), influenza virus. pseudotyped hiv-1 virions, a-mlv and
aslv-a envs also exhibit = 1 entry stoichiometry. contrast, eight nine 
influenza virus hemagglutinin trimers function cooperatively achieve
membrane fusion virus entry, using ph-dependent pathway. different
entry requirements cooperativity among env trimers retroviruses and
influenza virus may influence viral strategies replication evasion of
the immune system.
