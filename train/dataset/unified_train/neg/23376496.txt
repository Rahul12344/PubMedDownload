hepatitis b virus x (hbx) protein involved initiation progression
of hbv-related hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) regulating host protein-coding
genes. however, role hbx epigenetic repression mirnas, which
play important roles gene regulation hepatocarcinogenesis, remains
largely unknown. study, expression mir-132 hcc cells,
hbv-related hcc tissues, serum determined using real-time pcr. level
of dna methylation promoter mir-132 examined using
methylation-specific pcr (msp). mir-132 functionally characterized hcc
cells transiently altered mir-132 expression. hbx-induced dna
hypermethylation promoter mir-132 found prevalent in
hbx-expressing hepg2 cells control cells. consistently, mir-132
expression also frequently down-regulated hbv-related hcc tissues
than adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues significant inverse
correlation hbx expression hbv-related hccs. serum mir-132 levels were
found significantly correlated levels tumor tissue. finally,
proliferation colony formation hcc cells found suppressed by
mir-132-mediated inhibition akt-signaling pathway mir132 transfected
cells. study demonstrated epigenetic repression mir-132 expression
through dna methylation induced hbx. work provides novel mechanistic
insights hbv-mediated hepatocarcinogenesis suggests mir-132 may 
a promising biochemical marker may therapeutic applications in
hbv-related hcc.
