the gene protein bacteriophage phi x 174 initiates replication of
super-twisted rfi dna cleaving viral (+) strand origin of
replication binding 5' end. upon addition e. coli rep protein
(single-stranded dna dependent atpase), e. coli single-stranded dna binding
protein atp, complete unwinding two strands occurs. electron
microscopic analyses intermediates reaction reveal unwinding
occurs movement 5' end duplex, displacing viral strand 
the form single-stranded loop. since unwinding occur absence
of either gene protein rep protein, presumed rep protein
interacts form complex bound gene protein. single-stranded dna
binding protein facilitates unwinding binding exposed
single-stranded dna. addition four deoxyribotriphosphates dna 
polymerase iii holoenzyme reaction results synthesis viral (+)
single-stranded circles amounts exceeding input template. model 
describing role gene protein rep protein duplex dna replication
is presented properties gene protein discussed.
