objective: investigate prevalence epstein-barr virus (ebv)-associated
gastric carcinomas guangzhou, clinicopathologic features related
protein expressions including dnmt1, p16, cyclin d1.
method: total 676 cases ebv-associated gastric carcinoma included in
the study. presence ebv-encoded small rna1 (eber1), marker ebv
infection, analyzed in-situ hybridization using formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tumor samples. expression ebv-encoded proteins, dnmt1, p16
and cyclin d1 detected immunohistochemistry.
results: forty-five 676 gastric carcinomas showed eber intranuclear positivity
in tumor cells. ebv involvement significantly frequent among the
male female patients, especially tumors less differentiated types 
(diffuse type) involving upper stomach (p < 0.05). ebna1 lmp2a
expression detected 42 (93.3%) 24 (53.3%) cases, respectively. none
expressed ebna2, lmp1, zebra. among 45 cases ebv associated gastric
carcinomas, dnmt1, p16 cyclin d1 expression seen 35 (77.8%), 10
(22.2%), 29 (64.4%) cases, respectively. contrast, among 40 ebv negative
gastric carcinomas, expression three proteins 20 (50.0%), 25 (62.5%) 
and 12 (30.0%), respectively. difference expression three proteins 
between two groups significant (p < 0.05). expression p16 correlated
with depth tumor invasion. correlated protein expression seen
between lmp2a dnmt1, dnmt1 p16, p16 cyclin d1 (p 
< 0.05).
conclusions: ebv associated gastric carcinoma accounts 6.7% gastric
carcinomas guangzhou latency pattern cases between
latency ii others. correlated expression lmp2a, dnmt1, p16 and
cyclin d1 may contribute pathogenesis ebv associated gastric
carcinomas.
