a number reports associate human papillomavirus (hpv) cervical cancer and
cancer cell lines derived tumour type. considerably fewer reports 
focused role hpv carcinomas sites female anogenital
squamous epithelia. study tested presence hpv eight
low-passage vulvar carcinoma cell lines one extensively passaged cell line,
a431. one cell line primary vaginal carcinoma included. presence
of hpv evaluated polymerase chain reaction (pcr), southern blot
analysis two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. general primer-mediated pcr 
was applied using primers l1 region, e1 region hpv 16 e7 region. 
southern blot hybridisation performed low-stringency conditions (tm =
-35 degrees c) using whole genomic hpv 6/16/18 probe mixture high
stringency conditions (tm = -18 degrees c) whole genomic probes hpv
16 33. hpv 16 e6-e7 mrna assessed ribonuclease protection assay (rpa).
hpv found one vulvar carcinoma cell line, um-scv-6. identified
type, hpv 16, integrated cell genome could amplified all
primers used. also e6-e7 transcripts found cells. five original
tumour biopsies available hpv-negative cell lines situ
hybridisation. hpv negative hpv 6/16/18 screening
probe mixture low stringency hpv 16 probe high stringency.
the results indicate vulvar carcinoma cell lines contain hpv less frequently
than cervical carcinoma cell lines suggest significant proportion of
vulvar carcinomas may evolve hpv-independent mechanism.
