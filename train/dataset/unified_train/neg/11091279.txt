primary biliary cirrhosis autoimmune disease liver helper
1 cytokines predominate helper 2 pathogenesis.
interleukin- 18 (il-18), gene recently cloned, novel t
helper 1 cytokine, augments interferon-gamma production. designed this
study clarify role il-18 primary biliary cirrhosis examine
whether serum il-18 level prognostic indicator disease. serum
il-18 levels measured using enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay mouse
monoclonal antibodies. twenty-two healthy volunteers, 31 patients primary
biliary cirrhosis (scheuer's stage i, 13; ii, 10; iv, 8), 20 patients with
autoimmune hepatitis, 11 patients virus-related liver cirrhosis six
patients obstructive jaundice enrolled. significant differences of
serum il-18 levels observed patients scheuer's stage iv and
those stage i, ii, virus-related liver cirrhosis obstructive jaundice
(p < 0.05). il-18 levels primary biliary cirrhosis increased according 
the disease progression, fell promptly living-related liver
transplantation. moreover, serum il-18 levels primary biliary cirrhosis were
correlated serum bilirubin concentrations risk scores mayo
clinic prognostic model disease. il-18 levels observed patients
with autoimmune hepatitis also elevated, correlated activity of
the disease. results indicate serum interleukin-18 levels reflect 
severity primary biliary cirrhosis, activity autoimmune hepatitis, 
may additive prognostic indicator primary biliary cirrhosis.
