the relationship virulence mice coxsackievirus b4 prototype jbv
strain selected mutants several vitro genetic markers been
examined. markers studied include t, d, ds, deae-d, guanidine resistance 
(g), markers plaque size marker, designated ps. jvb strain was
found characteristics t-, d-, ds+, deae-d+, g-, ps+ be
virulent inoculated intraperitoneal route suckling cd-1 mice
(log titer/ld50 = 6.4/6.0). one naturally occurring mutant strain (characteristic
= t-, d+, ds+, g-, ps+ selected terminal end point dilution found to
be virulent (log titer/ld50 = 7.0/6.0). passage jvb population the
presence guanidine hydrochloride (75 micrograms/ml) allowed selection of
avirulent, guanidine resistant mutants characteristics t-, d-, ds+,
deae-d+, g+. mutants produced small plaques (1.0-1.6 mm) were
designated ps-. prototype selected strains contained both
large plaque small plaque variants characterized ps+ were
invariably virulent. although variance character demonstrated
in strains, conclude virulence vitro genetic

system. relationship plaque size (ps) and/or guanidine resistance (g+) 
of selected strains coxsackievirus b4 avirulence demonstrated 
this system.
