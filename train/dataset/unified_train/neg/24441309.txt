epstein-barr virus (ebv) tumorigenic human Î³-herpesvirus, produces
several known structured rnas functional importance: two implicated in
latency maintenance tumorigenic phenotypes, eber1 eber2; viral small
nucleolar rna (v-snorna1) may generate small regulatory rna; an
internal ribosomal entry site ebna1 mrna. recent bioinformatics and
rna-seq study ebv identified two novel ebv non-coding (nc)rnas with
evolutionary conservation lymphocryptoviruses likely functional
importance. rnas transcribed repetitive region ebv genome 
(the w repeats) highly oncogenic type viral latency. one novel ncrna 
can form massive (586 nt) hairpin, rna generated a
short (81 nt) intron found high abundance ebv-infected cells.
