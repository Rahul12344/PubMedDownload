rmp-7, bradykinin analog, shown selectively open blood-tumor
barrier delivery chemotherapeutic drugs brain tumors. contrast
to bradykinin, rmp-7 hypotensive effects approved human
use. study initiated determine whether rmp-7 would open the
blood-tumor barrier virus vectors encoding tumor-killing genes an
experimental model. herpes virus vector used, hrr3, encodes virus
thymidine kinase gene lacz reporter gene, defective gene encoding
ribonucleotide reductase, replicates selectively dividing tumor cells 
in postmitotic neural cells. determined optimum dose rmp-7
(1.5-3.0 microg/kg 10-15 minutes) enhanced viral delivery brain tumors in
rats bearing intracranial 9 l gliosarcomas infused carotid
artery immediately prior virus vector application. maximum expression the
lacz reporter gene occurred 3 days intracarotid infusion. 8 days,
transgene expression largely confined tumor foci away main tumor 
mass. viral delivery essentially specific tumor cells, little
transgene expression elsewhere brain. minimal uptake pathology was
noted kidney, spleen, liver. findings indicate intracarotid
delivery rmp-7 augment selective delivery virus vectors brain
tumors experimental rat model, potential application human 
brain tumors.
