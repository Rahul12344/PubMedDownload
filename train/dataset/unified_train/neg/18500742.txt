oncolytic virotherapy demonstrated multimodal antitumor mechanisms both
preclinical clinical settings cancer treatment, including antitumor
immunity. compared conventional immunotherapy, oncolytic viruses the
advantages simultaneous cytoreduction conferring personalized anticancer
immunity, without need personalized manufacture. additionally,
oncolytic viruses engineered delete immunosuppressive viral
components insert transgenes enhance antitumor immunity. finally,
combination new immunomodulating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) cell
therapy approaches likely augment specific antitumor immunity of
virotherapy. virotherapy could become new paradigm potent, safe and
practical therapeutic vaccines cancer.
