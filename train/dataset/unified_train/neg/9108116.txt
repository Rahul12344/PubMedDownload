cerebral plaques containing beta-amyloid (beta a4) represent invariant
pathological feature alzheimer disease (ad). beta a4 proteolytically
generated parent molecule, amyloid precursor protein (app). in
non-neuronal cells beta a4 shown secreted via ph-sensitive and
endocytosis-dependent pathway, process, occurring brain, 
considered play important role ad. neurons mechanisms beta a4 
production known. analyzed mechanisms expressing
human app mutant versions hippocampal neurons using semliki forest
virus system. show cells initially generate two pools beta a4,
an extracellular intracellular, extracellular pool is
produced via ph-sensitive endocytosis-dependent pathway. thus, hippocampal 
neurons able utilize alternate pathway produce intracellular beta
a4. also show common feature two types app mutations ("swedish"
and "london") implicated early-onset ad increased production of
c-terminally elongated beta a4 (beta 42), intra- extracellularly. since 
neurons cells produce substantial levels intracellular beta 
a4 also main victims ad, findings may provide important link 
between beta a4 neurodegeneration.
