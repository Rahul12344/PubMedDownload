the morphological changes platelets acute subacute african swine fever 
(asf) relationship pathogenesis studied. eight pigs were
inoculated highly virulent strain african swine fever (malawi '83) 
14 moderately virulent strain (dominican republic '78) ultrastructural
study platelets, monocyte/macrophages vascular structures liver,
spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, lung kidney. viruses produced
activation degranulation platelets day 3 inoculation onwards,
coinciding activation mononuclear phagocyte system virus
replication monocyte/macrophages. platelet aggregation viscous
metamorphosis platelets observed 5 7 days inoculation with
the highly virulent strain, coinciding endothelial alterations, platelet
aggregation less prevalent sign viscous metamorphosis 
animals inoculated moderately virulent strain. virions within platelets 
were observed final stage acute asf 5-7 days inoculation
in subacute asf. suggests platelets assist disseminating asf virus
within body, especially subacute infections.
