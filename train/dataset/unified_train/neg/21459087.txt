the use recombinant lentiviral vectors (rlv) emerging viable candidate
for clinical gene therapy central nervous system. new generation vectors
are produced addressing viral safety concerns well production
capabilities. furthermore, ability combine envelope proteins targeting
specific cell types specific promoters guiding expression genetic
payload allow researchers clinicians precisely guide transgene
expression anatomically phenotypically distinct populations cells. a
recent issue experimental neurology, cannon colleagues demonstrate the
ability transduce specific populations cells rat midbrain using
differently pseudotyped lentiviral vectors results significant
differences transgene spread throughout nigrostriatal tract. results
highlight potential utility rlv clinical applications well in
research involving neurodegenerative disease.
