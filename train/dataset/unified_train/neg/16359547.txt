background: mitochondrial dna (mtdna) known high mutation rates caused 
lack protective histones, inefficient dna repair systems, continuous
exposure mutagenic effects oxygen radicals. alterations non-coding
displacement (d) loop mitochondrial dna present many cancers. has
been suggested extent mitochondrial dna mutations might useful 
the prognosis cancer outcome and/or response certain therapies. in
order investigate whether high incidence mutations exist mitochondrial
dna cervical cancer patients, examined frequency mutations the
d-loop region 19 patients cervical cancer.
results: mutations, often multiple, detected 18 19 (95%) patients. the
presence mutations correlated human papilloma virus (hpv) infection in
these patients. mutations also detected normal samples lymphocytes
obtained cervical cancer patients, frequency occurrence was
much lower compared cervical cancer tissues.
conclusion: findings indicate d-loop alterations frequent in
cervical cancers possibly caused hpv infection. no
association mtdna d-loop mutations histopathological grade tumor 
staging.
