human herpesvirus 8 gammaherpesvirus may implicated the
pathogenesis multiple myeloma. viral dna sequences found bone
marrow, peripheral blood leukapheresis products myeloma patients. these
findings significant implications use leukapheresed cells 
transplantation immunotherapy myeloma. studies suggest cell 
harbours virus may dendritic origin. previously reported that
dendritic cells cultured use clinical setting harbour hhv-8. in
this study, examined leukapheresis products larger cohort myeloma 
patients presence hhv-8 using highly sensitive pcr technique. a
strong association hhv-8 myeloma confirmed, 4% of
the patient samples positive viral sequences. study needed, 
the current use apheresis cells cultured progeny treatment of
myeloma compromised.
