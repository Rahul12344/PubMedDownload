we describe new global multiple-alignment program capable aligning large
number genomic regions. progressive-alignment approach incorporates the
following ideas: maximum-likelihood inference ancestral sequences, automatic
guide-tree construction, protein-based anchoring ab-initio gene predictions,
and constraints derived global homology map sequences. have
implemented ideas mavid program, able accurately align
multiple genomic regions megabases long. mavid able effectively align
divergent sequences, well incomplete unfinished sequences. demonstrate
the capabilities program benchmark cftr region, consists of
1.8 mb human sequence 20 orthologous regions marsupials, birds, fish,
and mammals. finally, describe two large mavid alignments, alignment all
the available hiv genomes multiple alignment entire human, mouse,
and rat genomes.
