several viruses, epstein-barr virus, known associated 
several human cancers, patients viral infections develop
cancer. transplantation, viruses often prolonged time gap from
infection cancer development, many preceded period circulating
and detectable nucleic acids peripheral blood compartment. the
interpretation viral load measure posttransplant risk developing 
cancer depends virus, cancer associated pathogenic factors. this
review describes current state knowledge regarding utility and
limitations peripheral blood nucleic acid testing epstein-barr virus in
surveillance risk prediction posttransplant lymphoproliferative
disorders.
