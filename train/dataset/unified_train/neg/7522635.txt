paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (pnh) acquired hematopoietic disorder
characterized complement-mediated hemolytic anemia, pancytopenia, venous
thrombosis. clinical manifestations arise underlying molecular
defect bone marrow stem cells. specifically, somatic mutations the
phosphatidylinositol glycan class gene result ability blood cells 
anchor complement-regulatory proteins (cd59 daf) cell surface via
glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (gpi). attempt circumvent functional
defect pnh cells, recombinant transmembrane form cd59 (cd59-tm) was
analyzed ability regulate complement activity. balb/3t3 stable
transfectants expressing similar levels either cd59-tm native cd59
(cd59-gpi) equally protected human complement-mediated membrane
damage. treatment cells phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase
c failed release cd59-tm cell surface. retroviral transduction of
gpi-anchoring deficient mouse l cells cd59-tm resulted surface expression
of protein rendered cells resistant human complement-mediated
membrane damage. conversely, l cells transduced cd59-gpi failed express
this protein cell surface. gpi-anchoring deficient complement-sensitive 
b-cell line derived pnh patient successfully transduced cd59-tm, 
resulting surface expression protein. pnh b cells expressing
cd59-tm protected classical complement-mediated membrane damage by
human serum. taken together, data establish functional recombinant
transmembrane form cd59 expressed surface gpi-anchoring
deficient pnh cells suggest retroviral gene therapy molecule
could provide treatment pnh patients.
