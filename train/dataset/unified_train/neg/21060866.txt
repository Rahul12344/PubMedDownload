deb025/debio 025 (alisporivir) cyclophilin (cyp)-binding molecule with
potent anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) activity vitro vivo. is
currently evaluated phase ii clinical trials. deb025 binds cypa, a
peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase crucial cofactor hcv
replication. report difficult select resistant
replicons (genotype 1b) deb025, requiring average 20 weeks (four
independent experiments), compared typically <2 weeks protease or
polymerase inhibitors. indicates high genetic barrier resistance for
deb025. mutation d320e ns5a mutation consistently selected the
replicon genome. mutation alone conferred low-level (3.9-fold) resistance.
replacing ns5a gene (but ns5b gene) wild type (wt) genome
with corresponding sequence deb025(res) replicon resulted in
transfer resistance. cross-resistance cyclosporine (csa) observed, 
whereas ns3 protease ns5b polymerase inhibitors retained wt-activity 
deb025(res) replicons. unlike wt, deb025(res) replicon replicated efficiently 
cypa knock cells. however, deb025 disrupted interaction cypa and
ns5a regardless whether ns5a protein derived wt deb025(res)
replicon. nmr titration experiments peptides derived wt the
deb025(res) domain ii ns5a corroborated observation quantitative
manner. interestingly, comparative nmr studies two 20-mer ns5a peptides that
contain d320 e320 revealed shift population major minor
conformers. data suggest d320e conferred low-level resistance to
deb025 probably reducing need cypa-dependent isomerisation ns5a.
prolonged deb025 treatment multiple genotypic changes may necessary to
generate significant resistance deb025, underlying high barrier to
resistance.
