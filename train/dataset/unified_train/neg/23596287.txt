interleukin-22 (il-22) redundant, protective, pathogenic functions 
autoimmune, inflammatory, infectious diseases. here, addressed the
potential role il-22 host defense pathogenesis lethal and
sublethal respiratory h3n2 influenza virus (iav) infection. show il-22,
as well factors associated production, expressed lung
tissue early phases iav infection. data indicate retinoic 
acid receptor-related orphan receptor-γt (rorγt)-positive αβ γδ cells, as
well innate lymphoid cells, expressed enhanced il22 transcripts early 2 
days postinfection. lethal sublethal iav infections, endogenous il-22
played role control iav replication development the
iav-specific cd8(+) cell response. lethal infection, wild-type
(wt) mice succumbed severe pneumonia, lack il-22 accelerate 
delay iav-associated pathogenesis animal death. stark contrast, during
sublethal iav infection, il-22-deficient animals enhanced lung injuries and
showed lower airway epithelial integrity relative wt littermates. of
importance, protective effect endogenous il-22 pulmonary damages was
associated controlled secondary bacterial infection. indeed, after
challenge streptococcus pneumoniae, iav-experienced il22(-/-) animals were
more susceptible wt controls terms survival rate bacterial burden 
in lungs. together, il-22 plays major role lethal influenza 
beneficial sublethal h3n2 iav infection, limits lung inflammation
and subsequent bacterial superinfections.
