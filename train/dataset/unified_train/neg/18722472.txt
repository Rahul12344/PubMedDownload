respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) common cause severe
bronchiolitis infants young children u.s. licensed rsv vaccines 
are currently available. established techniques recovering rsv cdna
utilize mammalian cells, hep-2 bsr t7/5, currently
suitable vaccine manufacture. using hep-2 cells, co-infection an
attenuated vaccinia virus expresses t7 rna polymerase also required. 
human clinical trials, processes require use helper viruses
and minimize use animal derived materials must developed reduce 
potential theoretical risk transmitting adventitious agents bse. rsv
was generated electroporating vero cells well characterized cell bank
with 6 plasmids expressing t7 rna polymerase, full-length anti-genomic rsv
and rsv n, p, m2-1 l. process optimized highly attenuated
and temperature-sensitive rsv vaccine candidates could recovered system
completely free animal derived components. efficiencies virus recovery
ranged 30% 100%. human metapneumovirus also readily recovered,
suggesting protocol applicable production clinical trial 
material non-segmented negative sense rna viruses.
