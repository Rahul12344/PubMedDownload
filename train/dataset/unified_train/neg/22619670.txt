anti-hepatitis c virus (hcv) antibody seropositivity independently associated 
with poor prognosis hemodialysis (hd) patients. however, anti-hcv antibody
cannot distinguish patients active infection have
recovered infection. therefore aimed study examine the
association hcv core antigen (hcvcag) seropositivity mortality hd
patients. first measured serum hcvcag using immunoradiometric assay and
anti-hcv antibody 405 patients regular hd, followed 104
months. 82 patients (20.2%) positive anti-hcv
antibodies; 57 (69.5%) positive hcvcag. follow-up,
29 patients excluded, tested association hcvcag seropositivity 
with all-cause, cardiovascular (cv) non-cv mortalities 376 patients. a
total 209 patients (55.6%) expired observational period, 92 out
of due cv causes. adjusting comorbid parameters, hcvcag was
independently associated overall mortality (hr 1.61, 95% ci 1.05-2.47, p <
0.05). hcv infection significantly related liver disease-related
mortality. past hcv infection also contributed cv mortality (hr 2.63, 95% ci
1.27-5.45, p < 0.01). contrast, anti-hcv antibody hcvcag seropositivities 
did associate infectious disease-related cancer-related (expect 
hepatocellular carcinoma) mortality. follows findings hcvcag
serology associated all-cause cv mortality hd patients.
