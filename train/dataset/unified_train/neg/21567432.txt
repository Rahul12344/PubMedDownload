the distribution evolution human rotavirus strains important for
vaccine development effectiveness. settings rotavirus vaccine
coverage high, vaccine pressure could select replacement common strains
(similar included rotavirus vaccines) uncommon strains, 
which could generated reassortment human animal rotaviruses.
between 2002 2004, phase-iii rotavirus vaccine clinical trial conducted
among american indian children navajo white mountain apache tribes,
which known high risk rotavirus diarrhea. evaluated the
rotavirus strains collected study participants received placebo during
the trial determine distribution rotavirus genotypes detect
emerging strains contribute disease could influence rotavirus vaccine
effectiveness. three uncommon strains human rotavirus, two g3p[3] one
g3p[9] strains detected stools children aged 3 6 months age.
segments 11 rotavirus genes sequenced genotyped comparison 
cognate gene fragments reference strains. g3p[3] strains similar
genotypes reference dog cat strains. g3p[9] strain
had similar genotypes cow, cat dog reference strains. genetic analyses 
these three strains support known diversity generating mechanisms of
rotavirus.
