a series short insertion mutations introduced poliovirus gene for
3dpol number different locations. substituted wild-type
sequences full-length, infectious cdna tested infectivity, 3d
mutants nonviable. mutant cdnas introduced bacterial plasmid
designed direct expression poliovirus 3cd, viral protein composed 
contiguous protease rna polymerase sequences. bacteria transformed these
plasmids expressed similar amounts 3cd, mutant proteins cleaved
themselves generate wild-type 3cpro mutant 3dpol polypeptides with
approximately efficiency wild-type 3cd. released mutant 3dpol
proteins defective rna-dependent rna polymerase activity vitro.
uncleaved 3cd protease required processing viral capsid protein
precursor, p1. vitro assay p1 cleavage activity, mutant
3cd proteins expressed escherichia coli showed normal activity, others
were clearly inactive. thus, alterations sequence and/or folding of
different regions 3d protein differential effects various
activities.
