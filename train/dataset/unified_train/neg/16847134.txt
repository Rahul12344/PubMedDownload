the rna genome plum pox virus (ppv) encodes one large polyprotein is
subsequently cleaved mature viral proteins. one products of
proteolytic processing, 6k1 protein, yet identified vivo 
any member genus potyvirus. study, 6k1-specific polyclonal
antiserum raised ppv 6k1 expressed escherichia coli a
translational fusion n terminus avian troponin c unusual
metal-binding cluster troponin t-1. detection 6k1 vivo, a
pppv-h6k1-nat infectious clone constructed, enabling concentration of
histidine-tagged 6k1 affinity chromatography. affinity-purified 6k1 was
detected locally infected nicotiana benthamiana leaves 4, 7 14 days
post-inoculation (d.p.i.) and, addition, systemically infected leaves 14
d.p.i., 6k1 detected exclusively protein 6 kda polyprotein
precursors identified raised anti-6k1 antiserum.
