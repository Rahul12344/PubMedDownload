the adherence bacteria eukaryote cells largely investigated 
essential step occurrence bacterial infection. clinical and
epidemiological studies revealed frequent association certain viral
infections bacterial infections originating ecological niche.
therefore, investigated effect viral preinfection (adv4) some
cultivated cells (hep-2 ic.sk-27) upon adherence staphylococcus to
these cells. analysis cell adherence within mentioned conditions,
estimated flow cytometry, allowed following conclusions: 1. bacterial
adherence cultivated virally preinfected cells augmented viral
preinfection, value given cell substrate may characterize a
bacterial strain; 2. bacterial adherence investigated cell substrates does
not correlate origin tested staphylococcus strains (infections or
carriers) cell lines differentiate bacterial strains depending upon 
the ecological niche inside it.
