chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection progression major health
problems many countries including saudi arabia facing. determination 
hcv genotypes subgenotypes critical epidemiological clinical
analysis aids determination ideal treatment strategy needs
to followed expected therapy response. although hcv infection been
identified second predominant type hepatitis saudi arabia,
little known molecular epidemiology genetic variability hcv
circulating jeddah province saudi arabia. aim study 
determine dominance various hcv genotypes subgenotypes circulating 
jeddah using partial sequencing ns5b region. best knowledge,
this first study kind saudi arabia. characterize hcv
genotypes subgenotypes, serum samples 56 patients chronic hcv
infection collected subjected partial ns5b gene amplification and
sequence analysis. phylogenetic analysis ns5b partial sequences revealed
that hcv/1 predominant genotype (73%), followed hcv/4 (24.49%) and
hcv/3 (2.04%). moreover, pairwise analysis also confirmed results based 
the average specific nucleotide distance identity: ±0.112, ±0.112, ±0.179 for
hcv/1, hcv/4, hcv/3, respectively, without interference between
genotypes. notably, phylogenetic tree hcv/1 subgenotypes revealed that
all isolates (100%) present study belonged hcv/1a
subgenotype. findings also revealed similarities nucleotide sequences 
between hcv circulating saudi arabia circulating countries such
as morocco, egypt, canada, india, pakistan, france. results indicated
that determination hcv genotypes subgenotypes based partial sequence
analysis ns5b region accurate reliable hcv subtype
determination.
