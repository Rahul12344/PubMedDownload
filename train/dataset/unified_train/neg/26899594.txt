a novel series metal-free artificial ribonucleases (arnases) designed,
synthesized assessed terms ribonuclease activity ability to
inactivate influenza virus wsn/a33/h1n1 vitro. compounds built two
short peptide fragments, include lys, ser, arg, glu imidazole residues 
in various combinations, connected linkers different hydrophobicity
(1,12-diaminododecane 4,9-dioxa-1,12-diaminododecane). compounds
efficiently cleaved different rna substrates physiological conditions at
rates three five times higher artificial ribonucleases described 
earlier displayed rnase a-like cleavage specificity. arnases the
hydrophobic 1,12-diaminododecane linker displayed ribonuclease activity 3-40
times higher arnases 4,9-dioxa-1,12-diaminododecane linker. the
assumed mechanism rna cleavage typical natural ribonucleases, is,
general acid-base catalysis via formation acid/base pairs functional
groups amino acids present arnases; ph profile cleavage
confirmed mechanism. active arnases study exhibited high
antiviral activity entirely inactivated influenza virus a/wsn/33/(h1n1) after
a short incubation period viral suspension physiological conditions.
