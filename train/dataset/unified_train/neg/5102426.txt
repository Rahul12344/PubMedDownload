modification sindbis virus glycoprotein host-specified glycosyl
transferases.

grimes wj, burge bw.

the amino acid sequence membrane glycoprotein sindbis virus is
specified viral genome, determined whether the
carbohydrate portion molecule specified cell virus.
we examined two enzyme activities catalyze transfer of
monosaccharides glycoprotein (sialyl fucosyl transferases). comparison 
particulate enzyme preparations infected uninfected cells showed no
difference either specific activity acceptor specificity these
enzymes. impressive view fact sindbis membrane
glycoprotein glycoprotein synthesized infected cell. was
also determined sialyl transferase uninfected cells capable of
transferring ((3)h) sialic acid acceptor prepared sindbis membrane
glycoprotein. results imply least carbohydrate the
virus glycoprotein arise host modification.
