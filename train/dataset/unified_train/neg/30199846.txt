background: rift valley fever virus (rvfv) emerging arbovirus africa and
the arabian peninsula, infection rvfv poses serious threat to
humans livestock globally. approved treatments rvfv infection, especially
for use humans, yet developed. urgent need for
effective drugs prevent rvfv disease.
methods: previous study, developed rvfv virus like particles (vlps)
expressing surface glycoproteins gn gc. morphology shown be
similar live rvfv electron microscopy. study, immunized
horses rvfv vlps, prepared immunoglobulin f(ab')2 fragments, and
characterized vitro neutralization vivo efficacy mice.
results: f(ab')2 found potently neutralize rvfv veroe6 cells, and
passive transfer immunoglobulin f(ab')2 fragments resulting reduced
mortality rvfv infected mice.
conclusion: results show passive immunotherapy equine
immunoglobulin f(ab')2 fragments promising strategy treat rvfv
infections.
