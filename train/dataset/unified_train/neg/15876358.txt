background: human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) associated the
development adult t-cell leukemia (atl). htlv-1 encoded tax1 oncoprotein
activates transcription genes involved cell growth anti-apoptosis
through nf-kappab pathway, thought play critical role the
pathogenesis atl. tax1 expression usually lost minimal atl
cells, cells still show high constitutive nf-kappab activity, indicating
that genetic epigenetic changes atl cells induce activation independent 
tax1. aim study identify molecules responsible the
constitutive activation nf-kappab atl cells using retroviral functional
cloning strategy.
results: using enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp) expression and
blasticidin-resistance selection markers, several retroviral cdna clones
exhibiting constitutive nf-kappab activity rat-1 cells, including full-length 
cd30, obtained atl cell line. exogenous stable expression cd30 in
rat-1 cells constitutively activated nf-kappab. elevated expression cd30 was
identified atl lines examined, primary atl cells small number
of patients (8 66 cases).
conclusion: elevated cd30 expression considered one causes of
constitutive nf-kappab activation atl cells, may involved atl
development.
