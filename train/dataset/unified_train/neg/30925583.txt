hepatitis b virus (hbv)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) major cause
of cancer-related deaths asia africa. developing effective and
non-invasive biomarkers hcc individual patients remains urgent task for
early diagnosis convenient monitoring. analyzing transcriptomic profiles 
of peripheral blood mononuclear cells healthy donors patients 
chronic hbv infection different states (i.e. hbv carrier, chronic hepatitis b,
cirrhosis, hcc), identified set 19 candidate genes according our
algorithm dynamic network biomarkers. genes characterize
different stages hcc progression identify cirrhosis critical
transition stage carcinogenesis. interaction effects (i.e.
co-expressions) candidate genes used build accurate prediction
model: so-called edge-based biomarker. considering convenience and
robustness biomarkers clinical applications, performed functional
analysis, validated candidate genes independent samples collected
cohort, finally selected col5a1, hla-dqb1, mmp2, cdk4 build edge panel
as prediction models. demonstrated edge panel great performance
in diagnosis prognosis terms precision specificity hcc,
especially patients alpha-fetoprotein-negative hcc. study only
provides novel edge-based biomarker non-invasive effective diagnosis of
hbv-associated hcc individual patient also introduces new way to
integrate interaction terms individual molecules clinical diagnosis
and prognosis network dynamics perspectives.
