standardisation nat assays necessary introduction assays
for routine screening blood blood products viral contaminants 
hbv, hcv, hiv-1. standardisation achieved use of
well-characterised reference materials (working reagents) validate assay 
run. working reagents hcv, hiv-1, hbv, hav, human parvovirus b19 have
been established nibsc. reagents reference panels also
available official medicinal control laboratories commercial
organisations. however, nucleic acid content reagents expressed 
in many different units, e. g. genome equivalents/ml, copies/ml, pcr detectable
units/ml, making comparisons results laboratories using different
reagents difficult. establishment internationally accepted standards
against working reagents could calibrated, using common standard
unit measurement, iu, would overcome major problem. first
international standard hcv rna assays established 1997. reagent, 
96/790, lyophilised preparation genotype 1 isolate the
concentration standard 10(5) iu/ml. two international standards
have since established; hiv-1 hbv, containing 10(5) iu/ml 10(6) 
iu/ml respectively. establishment hcv international standard 
critical introduction mandatory testing. since 1st july 1999, all
batches blood products marketed europe prepared plasma
pools tested found non-reactive hcv rna using validated assay can
detect sample containing 100 iu/ml hcv rna. germany, screening blood
donations hcv rna nat mandatory since 1st april 1999. minimum
sensitivity assays 5000 iu/ml single donation.
