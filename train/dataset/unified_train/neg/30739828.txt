the capsid assembly essential step hepatitis b virus (hbv) life cycle
and important target anti-hbv drug development. report, we
identified hit compound aminothiazole structure high throughput
screening (hts) inhibited interaction hbv capsid protein within 
cells. structure hopping sar studies hit compound afforded
compound 79 potent anti-hbv replication activity good basic drug-like
properties. working mechanism studies showed compound 79 could bind to
the similar binding site known hbv capsid inhibitor with
heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (hap) scaffold, similar hydrophobic
interactions different hydrogen bond. compound exerted potent
inhibitory effect upon hbv production, either cell culture mice 
obvious acute toxicity. propose development compound
could lead novel potent anti-hbv inhibitors target hbv capsid assembly.
