noroviruses (nov) leading cause outbreaks nonbacterial acute
gastroenteritis humans worldwide become important cause of
hospitalization children south america. nov belong family
caliciviridae non-enveloped single stranded, positive sense, rna viruses.
nov genotype gii/4 emerged worldwide, causing four epidemic seasons of
viral gastroenteritis four novel variants emerged. despite the
importance nov outbreaks, little known evolutionary rates, viral 
spread population dynamics nov populations. order gain insight 
these matters, bayesian markov chain monte carlo (mcmc) approach used to
analyze region full-length vp1 gene sequences gii/4 nov populations
isolated brazil japan, respectively. results studies revealed 
that expansion population growth model best fit data both
datasets. dates common recent ancestors revealed these
viruses quickly emerge geographical location. mean evolutionary rate
of 1.21 x 10(-2) nucleotide substitution/site/year (s/s/y) obtained the
vp1 gene using full-length sequences. rate higher rates reported
for rapidly evolving rna. roughly similar rates (1.44 x 10(-2)s/s/y) were
found using region sequences, revealing suitability region for
evolutionary studies, agreement previous reports. high evolutionary rates
and fast population growth may contributed vigorous initial
transmission dynamics gii/4 nov populations studied.
