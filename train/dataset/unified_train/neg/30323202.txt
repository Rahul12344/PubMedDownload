the human papillomavirus (hpv) present significant fraction of
head-and-neck squamous cell cancer (hnscc). main goal study to
identify distinct co-expression patterns hpv+ hpv- hnscc to
provide insights potential regulatory mechanisms/effects within analyzed
networks. selected cases deposited cancer genome atlas database
comprising data gene expression, methylation profiles mutational patterns,
in addition clinical information. intersection among differentially
expressed differentially methylated genes showed negative correlations
between levels methylation expression, suggesting genes
have expression levels regulated methylation alteration patterns in
their promoter. weighted correlation network analysis used identify
co-expression modules systematic approach applied refine and
identify key regulatory elements integrating results omics. three 
distinct co-expression modules associated hpv status molecular
signatures. validation using independent studies reporting biological
experimental data converged significant genes modules. this
study provides insights complex genetic epigenetic particularities in
the development progression hnscc according hpv status, contribute 
to unveiling specific genes/pathways novel therapeutic targets hnscc.
