because selectivity safety, microbial control agents (mcas) appear
to ready-made components integrated pest management (ipm) systems do
not pose threat applicators environment allow natural
enemies function. control several orchard pest insects using mcas,
including viruses, bacillus thuringiensis, fungi, entomopathogenic nematodes 
(epns), demonstrated apple, pear, stone fruits, citrus, several 
nut crops. b. thuringiensis used mca control lepidopteran
orchard pests. significant use epns citrus control root weevils is
also reported. granulovirus codling moth used increasingly apple and
pear organic growers, interest also shown conventional growers.
although success achieved, orchard systems mcas account for
a relatively small proportion pest control tactics employed, some
systems used all. research toward improving mca efficacy and
economic competitiveness required enhance role mcas ipm.
