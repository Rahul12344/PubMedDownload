african swine fever virus (asfv) etiological agent contagious and
often lethal viral disease domestic pigs. vaccines control
africa swine fever (asf). experimental vaccines developed using
genetically modified live attenuated asfvs obtained specifically deleting
virus genes involved virulence, including thymidine kinase (tk) gene. tk
has shown involved virulence several viruses, including
asfv. report construction recombinant virus (asfv-g/v-δtk)
obtained deleting tk gene virulent strain asfv georgia adapted 
replicate vero cells (asfv-g/vp30). asfv-g/p-δtk demonstrated decreased
replication primary swine macrophage cell cultures vero cells
compared asfv-g/vp30. vivo, intramuscular administration 10(6)
tcid50 asfv-g/v-δtk result asf disease. however, animals are
not protected challenged virulent parental georgia strain.
