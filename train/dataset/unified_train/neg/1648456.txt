a biotin labelled human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) dna probe ecori fragment
(17kb) hcmv ad 169 strain prepared. situ hybridization hcmv was
performed paraffin section tissues collected autopsy case of
congenital combined immunodeficiency syndrome associated systemic hcmv
and pneumocystis carinii infections. pathological lesions hcmv infection
showed three different patterns: 1, necrotic granuloma type, 2, diffuse type, and
3, scattered type. hcmv dna identified inclusion bodies piled 
or granular positive material found nuclei cytoplasms giant
cells. addition, morphologically intact cells might observed positive 
for cmv dna either nuclei cytoplasms.
