bone morphogenetic proteins (bmps), members tgf-beta superfamily, have
been implicated nervous system development response injury. previous
studies shown recombinant bmp7 enhance dendritic growth protect
cultured neurons oxidative stress. presence extracellular 
bmp antagonists, bmp7 seems act locally. therefore, present study uses
bmp7 overexpression using adenovirus (ad)-mediated gene transfer examine its
effect mixed neuronal cultures. enhanced bmp7 expression selectively induces
neuronal cgrp expression time-dependent manner. bmp7 overexpression only
significantly protects cultures h2o2 toxicity reduces lipopolysaccharide
(lps) stimulation. concurrently, profoundly reduces microglial numbers, but
increases oligodendroglial endothelial cells. together, low-dose and
continuously expressed bmp7 neuroprotective and
differentiation-inductive.
