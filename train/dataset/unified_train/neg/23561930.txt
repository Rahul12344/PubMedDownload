the mri characteristics 21 hfmd patients brainstem encephalitis resulting
from ev71 infection examined identify lesion patterns helpful disease 
classification prognosis. author reviewed clinical mri data 21
children brainstem encephalitis infected ev71 outbreak hainan,
china may 2008 september 2010. thirteen cases brainstem encephalitis
were classified type based unilateral bilateral symmetrical patch-like
hyperintense t₁ t₂ mri signals restricted posterior brainstem. a
significant minority cases (6/13), damage spinal ventral horn was
also found. among 13 type cases, 2 patients died, 7 recovered fully, 
4 suffered various neurological sequelae. eight cases classified with
type ii brainstem encephalitis based vague, speckled hyperintense t₁ t₂ 
signal pattern posterior brainstem. six patients recovered fully,
and 2 cases suffered mild sequelae. reexamination mri revealed an
enduring lesion one type ii case, restricted medulla oblongata.
the prognosis type ii cases better type cases. lesion
pattern revealed mri distinguish type type ii brainstem
encephalitis due ev71 infection may prove valuable prognosis. while
