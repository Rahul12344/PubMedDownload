retrovirus p30-related antigen human syncytiotrophoblasts igg antibodies
in cord-blood sera.

suni j, wahlstr√∂m t, vaheri a.

sensitive immunological techniques used detect retrovirus markers in
human pregnancy. total 1,540 human cord-blood sera tested for
retrovirus-reactive igg antibodies using solid-phase enzyme immunoassay and
purified rd 114 virus antigen. these, 118 (7.7%) sera positive.
blocking assays specific animal anti-p30 sera, use control antigen, and
electrophoretic protein experiments combined immunological detection
indicated human antibodies reacted specifically p30 protein.
the occurrence antibodies cord-blood serum highly significant
correlation complications pregnancy also correlated number
of previous abortions stillbirths. goat anti-rd 114 p30 serum used
in peroxidase-anti-peroxidase tissue staining procedure, p30-related antigen 
was detected sections placental specimens (early term pregnancies, 
blighted ova, hydatidiform moles, destructive moles choriocarcinomas).
however, case syncytiotrophoblastic cells positive. these
findings, supplemented different types blocking tests, lead us to
conclude retrovirus p30-related antigen selectively expressed the
highly differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts, normal placenta are
directly exposed maternal blood. suggested retrovirus-reactive
antibodies may represent autoimmune-like immune response p30-related
syncytiotrophoblast antigen escaping cellular damage.
