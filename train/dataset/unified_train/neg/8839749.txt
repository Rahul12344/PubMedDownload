we investigated time course infection coxsackievirus b3 murine 
myocarditis determine extent (if any) persistent latent infection
that might responsible recurrence. employed polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) method detect extremely small amount genome amplification
techniques four-week-old bald/c mice (n = 140) infected coxsackievirus b3
by single intraperitoneal injection 1 x 10(4) plaque-forming units
(pfu)/mouse (group 1) 1 x 10(2) pfu/mouse (group 2). mice sacrificed 
days 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21 28, hearts resected rna
extraction. single chain dna synthesized 1 microgram rna the
viral genome amplified pcr. virus genome strongly amplified in
group 1 days 3 10, group 2 days 5 7, afterwards both
amplifications rapidly diminished. however, positive signal, though faint,
persisted groups day 28, time histological evidence of
myocarditis disappeared group 2. results demonstrated was
persistent latent virus infection myocardium throughout entire
study period 28 days. persistence might provide pathomechanism 
exacerbation recurrence myocarditis.
