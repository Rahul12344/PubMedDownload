twenty-seven brassinosteroid derivatives tested antiviral activity
against measles virus (mv) via virus-yield reduction assay. compounds 6b
[(22s,235)-3beta-bromo-5alpha,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one], 1d
[(22r,23r)-2alpha,3alpha,22,23-tetrahydroxy-beta-homo-7-oxa-stigmastan-6-one], 8a
[(22r,23r)-3beta-fluoro-22,23-dihydroxystigmastan-6-one], 9b
[(22s,23s)-3beta-fluoro-5alpha,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one] 10b
[(22s,23s)-5alpha-fluor-3beta,22,23-trihydroxystigmastan-6-one], selectivity
indexes (si) 40, 57, 31, 37 53, derivatives good antiviral
activity mv. si values higher obtained with
ribavirin (used reference drug). comparative analysis 50% cytotoxic
concentration (cc50) values, using confluent non-growing cells, gives and
indication structure-activity relationship. according degree of
cytotoxicity compounds divided three groups: low, intermediate and
high cytotoxicity. observing chemical structures compounds belonging to
the first group see less cytotoxic activities related the
presence 3beta-hydroxy group c-3 (ring a) double bond c-22 
and c-23 (side chain). replacement 5alpha-hydroxy group a
5alpha-fluoro group enhances cytotoxicity. halogenated brassinosteroid
derivatives c-3 position cytotoxic acetoxy group
in position. compounds 1d, 6b, 10b ribavirin, cytotoxicity
measurements also done replicating cells; cc50 values low, but
they still competed favourably ribavirin mv.
