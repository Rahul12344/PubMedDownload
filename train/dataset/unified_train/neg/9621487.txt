purpose: assess comparative efficacy drugs inhibitors human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) human macrophages lymphocytes, to
correlate results clinical outcome.
materials methods: human primary macrophages lymphocytes infected
with hiv presence following hiv inhibitors, currently in
clinical use: zidovudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, didanosine, lamivudine, pmea,
pmpa (all inhibitors hiv reverse transcriptase), saquinavir u-75875
(inhibitors hiv protease).
results: reverse transcriptase inhibitors tested showed markedly higher
antiviral activity macrophages lymphocytes. also protease inhibitors
have substantial anti-hiv activity macrophages, yet efficacy is
markedly diminished drugs added macrophage culture hiv, 
is virus established chronical infection. experimental
conditions, however, protease inhibitors among hiv-inhibitors in
clinical use able decrease virus replication chronically-infected
macrophages.
conclusions: results strong clinical implications, due important 
role macrophages pathogenesis hiv infection. macrophages the
major source hiv extralymphoid tissue levels, particularly central
nervous system, blood-brain barrier strongly limits penetration 
antiviral drugs. reasons, drugs, like stavudine zidovudine,
provided good anti-hiv activity macrophages, reasonable barrier
penetration substantial chances effective central nervous
system, thus affect virus replication sanctuary hiv hides and
replicates control immune system.
