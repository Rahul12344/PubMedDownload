the proviral integration site moloney leukemia virus (pim) family includes
three homologous members. pim-1 kinase important target effective
therapeutic interventions lymphomas, prostate cancer leukemia. the
current work, performed free energy calculations calculate binding
affinities several inhibitors targeting protein. alchemical method
with integration perturbation-based estimators end-point methods were
compared. computational results indicated alchemical method can
accurately predict binding affinities, end-point methods give
relatively unreliable predictions. decomposing free energy difference into
enthalpic entropic components mbar reweighting enabled us investigate
the detailed thermodynamic parameters entropy-enthalpy
compensation protein-ligand binding case identified. studied
the conformational ensemble, important protein-ligand interactions were
identified. current work sheds light understanding the
pim-1-kinase-inhibitor interactions atomic level useful the
further development potential drugs.
