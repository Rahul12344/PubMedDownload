the presence human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) genome spleen tissue studied 
by using dna hybridization techniques seropositive seronegative organ
donors without clinical laboratory confirmed hcmv infection. serum samples
of patients screened latex agglutination test (la) enzyme
linked immuno sorbent assay (elisa) presence hcmv antibodies, and
confirmed immunoblotting technique (ib). detection hcmv sequences
in spleen tissue dot blot dna hybridization (dbh) using probes derived from
immediate-early late regions (es bh fragment respectively) hcmv
genome used. samples positive dbh tested situ dna
hybridization (ish) using es probe. number spleen tissue specimens
positive hcmv nucleic acids indicated hcmv may present human
beings, even without serological evidence.
