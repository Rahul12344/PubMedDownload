replication-competent avian retroviruses, capable transducing expressing
up 2 kb nonviral sequences, available effect widespread gene
transfer chicken (chick) embryos (s. h. hughes, j. j. greenhouse, c. j.
petropoulos, p. sutrave, j. virol. 61:3004-3012, 1987). constructed
novel avian retroviral vectors encode human placental alkaline phosphatase
as marker whose expression histochemically monitored. vectors have
been tested expression introducing embryonic chick nervous
system. revealed expression retrovirally transduced genes
can spatially temporally limited without need tissue-specific
promoters. varying site time infection, targeted gene transfer 
be confined selected populations neural cells course several
days, time window sufficient many key developmental processes. 
capability differentially infecting specific target populations may avoid
confounding variables detrimental effects transduced gene on
processes unrelated cells tissue interest. vectors methods
thus useful studies effect transduced genes the
development various organs tissues avian embryogenesis. in
addition, vectors facilitate studies aimed understanding viral 
infection expression patterns.
