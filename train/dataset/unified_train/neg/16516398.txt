we ask consulting patients regularly whether keep pets order identify 
zoonotic factors. became apparent patients breast carcinoma (n=69)
owned significantly often dogs cats compared age matched female
controls. compared frequencies dog pet ownership data from
public available statistics women (n=1320) age group bavaria.
the striking result twice number patients kept
dogs permanently last 10 years time interrogation as
compared control individuals time interrogation (p=0.0000003,
relative risk 3.5). internet search morbidity breast carcinoma 
showed dogs protracted course disease metastases lung, liver and
bones, resembling course disease human breast cancer. contrast 
this, breast cancer presented cats dramatically short course main
but unusual location metastasis presents hind legs. recent
publication norway reported high frequency (53.3%) breast carcinomas
in 14,401 investigated dogs. transmissible factor factors come into
question? variants mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) productively
replicate human cells different animals, including dogs. many
investigators, all, could identify mmtv-like sequences sporadic human 
breast cancer. mmtv mmtv-like sequences investigated canine
breast carcinomas now. also conceivable microbes 
dog, example bacteria, could participate first steps carcinogenesis
in human. recently shown bartonella species promote vascularization
and prevent apoptosis infected cells methods helicobacter
pylori. considerations require research. epidemiologic cohort studies
and identification potential carcinogenic microbial factors prove or
disprove hypothesis risk factors dogs could contribute the
carcinogenesis human breast cancer.
