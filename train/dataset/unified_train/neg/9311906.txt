the expression single capsid protein norwalk virus (nv) spodoptera
frugiperda (sf9) insect cells infected recombinant baculovirus results in
the assembly virus-like particles (vlps) two sizes, predominant 38-nm, 
or virion-size vlps, smaller, 23-nm vlps. describe purification
and biochemical characterization 23-nm vlps. 23-nm vlps purified 
to 95% homogeneity medium sf9 cultures isopycnic cscl gradient
centrifugation followed rate-zonal centrifugation sucrose gradients. the
compositions purified 23- 38-nm vlps compared sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein immunoblots. vlps 
sizes showed doublet 58 kda, size full-length capsid protein.
upon alkaline treatment, 23-nm vlps underwent dissociation soluble
intermediates able reassemble 23- 38-nm vlps upon dialysis,
suggesting assembly types structures common pathway.
antigenic biochemical properties 38- 23-nm vlps examined 
found conserved. immunoprecipitation assays using polyclonal monoclonal
antibodies indicated immunodominant epitopes capsid protein well
as conformational epitopes conserved two types particles. the
trypsin cleavage site residue 227 protected assembled particles 
both sizes exposed alkaline dissociation. results, the
conservation binding activity forms recombinant nv vlps to
cultured cells (l. j. white, j. m. ball, m. e. hardy, t. n. tanaka, n. kitamoto, 
and m. k. estes, j. virol. 70:6589-6597, 1996), suggest tertiary folding
of capsid protein responsible properties conserved two
structures. hypothesize 23-nm vlps formed 60 units nv
capsid protein assembles structure t=1 symmetry.
