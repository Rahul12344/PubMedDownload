background: epidermodysplasia verruciformis rare genodermatosis
characterized unique susceptibility cutaneous human papillomaviruses
infection. patients show autosomal recessive patterns inheritance.
case presentation: report case two sisters clinically
epidermodysplasia verruciformis specific lesions face, neck, trunk, and
extremities. pcr analysis indicated presence human papillomavirus type 5
in lesions. electron microscopic examination showed viral-like particles in
keratinocyte nuclei stratum corneum epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions. addition, examined ever1 ever2 genes using
eight different primer pairs without finding nonsense frameshift mutations
in gdna lymphocytes elder sister.
conclusions: report, patient's parents epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions consanguineous marriage. ev develop the
elder sister five years age, parents perceive ev an
inherited disease. probability ev developed sisters only
6.25%. thus, rare sisters develop epidermodysplasia
verruciformis lesions considering parents presumed carriers
and disease reveal autosomal recessive pattern inheritance.
