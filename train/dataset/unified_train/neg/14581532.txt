murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (mhv) causes demyelination the
central nervous system (cns) rats mice. apoptotic oligodendrocytes have
been detected vicinity cns demyelinating lesions animals. 
however, whether mhv directly induce oligodendrocyte apoptosis been
documented. here, established rat oligodendrocyte culture is
morphologically phenotypically indistinguishable primary rat
oligodendrocytes. using culture, showed mature rat oligodendrocytes 
were permissive mhv infection support productive virus
replication. significantly, oligodendrocytes infected live and
ultraviolet light-inactivated viruses underwent apoptosis similar extent,
which readily detectable 24 h postinfection revealed apoptotic
bodies dna fragmentation, indicating mhv-induced apoptosis mediated
during early stages virus life cycle require virus
replication. prior treatment cells lysosomotropic agents nh(4)cl 
chloroquine well vacuolar proton pump-atpase inhibitor bafilomycin a1, 
all block acidification endosome, prevented oligodendrocytes 
from succumbing apoptosis induced mhv mutant oblv60, enters cells via
endocytosis, indicating fusion viral envelope cell membranes
triggers apoptotic cascade. treatment pan-caspase inhibitor
z-vad-fmk blocked mhv-induced apoptosis, suggesting involvement the
caspase-dependent pathway. results, thus, first time provide
unequivocal evidence infection oligodendrocytes mhv directly results
in apoptosis. finding provides explanation destruction of
oligodendrocytes damage myelin sheath mhv-infected cns suggests
that oligodendrocyte apoptosis may one underlying mechanisms the
pathogenesis mhv-induced demyelinating diseases animals.
