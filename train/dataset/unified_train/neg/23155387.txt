background: need timely collection diagnostic biosamples during
symptomatic episodes represents major obstacle large-scale studies acute 
respiratory infection (ari) epidemiology. may circumvented 
participants collect nasal swabs. compared self- staff-collected
swabs terms swabbing quality detection viral respiratory pathogens.
methodology/principal findings: conducted prospective study among employees 
of institution ari season 2010/2011 (december-march). weekly
emails sent participants (n = 84), reminding come the
study center case new symptoms. participants self-collected anterior
nasal swab one nostril, trained study personnel collected one the
other nostril. participants self-collected another two swabs (one each
nostril) subsequent day. human β-actin dna concentration determined in
the swabs quality control. viral respiratory pathogens detected by
multiplex rt-pcr (seeplex rv15 kit, seegene, eschborn, germany). 84
participants, 56 (67%) reported least one ari episode, 18 participants two,
and one participant three. self-swabbing highly accepted participants.
the amount β-actin dna per swab higher self- the
staff-collected swabs (p = 0.008). β-actin concentration lower the
self-swabs collected day 1 collected subsequent day
(p<0.0001). respiratory viral pathogen detected 31% (23/75) staff-
and 35% (26/75) self-collected swabs (p = 0.36). approaches, 
most frequently identified pathogens human rhinoviruses a/b/c (12/75 swabs, 
16%) human coronavirus oc43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). almost perfect
agreement self- staff-collected swabs terms pathogen detection 
(agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.85, p<0.0001).
conclusions/significance: nasal self-swabbing identification viral ari
pathogens proved equivalent staff-swabbing population terms
of acceptance pathogen detection.
