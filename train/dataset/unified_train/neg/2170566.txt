long-term persistence avian leukosis virus (alv), the
transformation-defective mutant prague strain rous sarcoma virus subgroup c
(td pr-c) established heterologous duck hosts infection in
mid-embryogenesis. transient viraemia observed 4 weeks after
hatching lost infected ducks 6 months. loss of
viraemia accompanied increasing synthesis virus-neutralizing
antibodies. spite strong virus-neutralizing antibodies, virus detected 
by cocultivation assay duck tissues throughout observation period up
to 5 years. viraemic phase infection, found integrated proviruses in
various tissues, preferentially stomach muscle tissue thymus. the
long-term persistence virus frequently accompanied liver necrosis and
neoplastic diseases. injection td pr-c virus early embryos resulted in
more pronounced infection accompanied increased copy number viral dna
per cell, high mortality remarkable atrophy thymus tissue infected
ducklings.
