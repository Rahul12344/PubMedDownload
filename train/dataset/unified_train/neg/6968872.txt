monoclonal antibodies distinguish human nk cells cytotoxic t
lymphocytes.

although widely accepted cells major role specific tumour 
immunity, much evidence natural killer (nk) cells, exist 
in many species spontaneously lyse certain tumour cells vitro, provide
early resistance tumour growth. human nk-cell activity augmented
in vitro interferon inducers, including polyinosinic:polycytidylic
acid (poly i:c); furthermore, nk-like activity generated mixed leukocyte
cultures (mlcs) specific cytotoxic t-cell (tc) activity. effector
cells generated human mlcs lyse allogeneic autologous virus-transformed 
tumour cells, difficult evaluate relative contributions tc 
and nk-like cells lysis latter, like cells, form
rosettes sheep erythrocytes react xenogeneic anti-human thymocyte
serum. report monoclonal antibodies human mononuclear cell
subpopulations distinguish tc nk nk-like cells. okt3 okt8
monoclonal antibodies (reactive virtually subset cells,
respectively) complement (c') ablate mlc-generated tc activity against
allogeneic normal cells decrease lysis hla-negative, nk-sensitive
k562 leukaemia cells nk, poly i:c-activated nk mlc-activated nk-like cells.
in contrast, okm1 monoclonal antibody (reactive low proportion of
non-adherent mononuclear cells well macrophages) c' causes marked
diminution nk poly i:c-activated nk-cell activity.
