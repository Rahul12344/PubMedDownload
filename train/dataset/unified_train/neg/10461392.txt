in attempt enhance frequency level expression a
poor-performing mmtv-driven transgene, co-integrated construct the
ovine beta-lactoglobulin (blg) gene transgenic mice. seven lines transgenic
mice possessing co-integrated blg mmtv-rz5 transgenes compared 12
lines mice possessed mmtv-rz5 construct. co-integration enhanced
the frequency expression mammary gland two 12 lines the
mmtv-rz5 transgene alone, five seven co-integrated blg.
surprisingly, co-integration also resulted co-expression two transgenes
in salivary gland, lung spleen addition mammary gland.
furthermore, transgenes expressed virgin animals, throughout
pregnancy lactation, suggesting developmental regulation the
locus follows mmtv-promoter. findings represent novel locus
control property ovine blg gene confers commitment locus to
the mammary gland, also range heterogeneous tissues possibly defined 
by second promoter locus.
