tissue 13 cervical cancers pelvic para-aortic lymph nodes the
same patient evaluated deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization human
papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid probe presence human
papillomavirus-related deoxyribonucleic acid sequences. twelve primary
malignancies squamous cancers one adenocarcinoma. eight the
primary tumors contained human papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid
sequences, five contained viral sequences closely related human
papillomavirus type 16. histopathologic diagnosis confirmed malignant cells in
six 13 lymph nodes; three specimens contained human papillomavirus
type 16 sequences three human papillomavirus type 16-related sequences.
one lymph node failed show malignant cells also contained human
papillomavirus type 16 deoxyribonucleic acid. remaining lymph nodes not
contain malignant cells either histologic examination deoxyribonucleic acid
hybridization. human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences the
lymph nodes similar matched primary cancer cases.
these data provide evidence implicating human papillomavirus the
etiology cervical cancer.
