phenylglycidyl ether (1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxy propane) (pge) tested genetic
activity bacterial mammalian tests. active the
salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. concentration-dependent mutagenicity 
demonstrated s. typhimurium strains ta1535 ta100 without rat s9, 
but strains ta98, ta1537, ta1538. results suggest pge, a
direct-acting mutagen causing base substitutions. phenylglycidyl ether not
induce 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants chinese hamster ovary cells, or
without rat s9, without serum medium. dose-dependent
enhancement sa7 virus transformation primary hamster embryo cells was
observed concentrations 1.6 microgram/ml higher. addition, this
compound able chemically transform secondary hamster embryo cells at
concentrations 6.2 micrograms/ml higher. dose 2500 mg/kg p.o., pge
was active host-mediated assay using c57b1/6 x c3h mice s. typhimurium
strain ta1535. activity represented positive response 2 5 animals
tested. murine testicular dna synthesis inhibited oral administration 
of pge 500 mg/kg.
