we prepared extensive set dna restriction fragments, irradiated with
uv light, detected crosslinked complementary strands electrophoresis in
denaturing agarose gels. experimental data quantified densitometry 
to determine tetranucleotide contributions crosslinking. tetranucleotide
contributions used predict genomic maps crosslinking probability
that permitted us identify two strongly crosslinking genomic regions having
295 389 base pairs length. two sequences shared the
(attttata).(tataaaat) octamer, candidate hotspot uv
light-induced crosslinking complementary strands dna.
