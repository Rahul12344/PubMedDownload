pectin methylesterase (pme), cell wall enzyme, known factor plant
growth morphogenesis. recently, pme participation gene silencing, plant
virus reproduction transgenesis revealed. here, role pme in
antivirus resistance studied. shown increasing pme enzymatic
activity induced additional pme gene even empty vector resulted in
suppression tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) reproduction including short- and
long-distance virus movement plant. revealed increased pme activity in
stably-transformed intact plants. example, transgenic tobacco n.
benthamiana plants expressing tmv movement protein gene gfp appeared
increased pme activity. tomato plants co-suppressing polygalacturonase gene
have increased pme activity well. moreover, light-induced psbo gene activation
was accompanied transcription pme gene. introduction foreign gene in
plant cell excess transcription genome resulted increasing pme
activity leading transcriptome status quo returning.
