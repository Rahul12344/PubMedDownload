lower nadir cd4 cell counts higher hiv viral loads associated with
increased risks adverse events progression hiv disease. cases
where medical records inaccessible incomplete, little evidence is
available regarding whether nadir cdr cell count hiv viral load reliably
reported patient population. compare survey data collected 207
hiv-infected individuals detained san francisco jails data collected from
electronic medical records (emr) kept jails community health
providers. sensitivity self-reported nadir cd4 cell count less 200
was 82 % [95 % confidence interval (ci) 68, 88], sensitivity reporting
an undetectable recent hiv viral load 93 % (95 % ci 84, 97). this
suggests highly socially marginalized population, nadir cd4 cell count 
and recent hiv viral load recalled accurately compared emr.
