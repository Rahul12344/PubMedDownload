antigen requirements, sensitivity, specificity enzyme immunoassays for
measles rubella viral antibodies.

enzyme immunoassay (eia) systems measles virus rubella virus studied
from standpoints requirements suitable viral antigens control
antigens, sensitivity specificity tests detecting antibody
elicited past infection (determination immunity status), for
serodiagnosis currenet infections. crude semipurified measles virus
antigens satisfactory eia, antigens derived pelleting virus 
infected cell culture fluids slightly specific reactivity than
were antigens produced lysates infected cells. however, reliable rubella 
eia antigens could produced infected cell culture fluids, they
required density gradient purification render suitably specific. even
with gradient-purified rubella antigens, necessary use antigen prepared
in identical fashion uninfected cell culture fluids control the
specificity reactions obtained test sera. appropriate viral antigens
and control antigens, measles rubella eia systems highly sensitive 
and specific determination immunity status serodiagnosis of
current infections. antibody detectable earlier course infection by
eia hemagglutination inhibition complement fixation, 
limit diagnostic value test, since titer increases demonstrable eia
were usually greater detectable hemagglutination inhibition or
complement fixation tests.
