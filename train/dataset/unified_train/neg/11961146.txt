background: x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency due mutation the
gene encoding common gamma (gamma(c)) chain lethal condition be
cured allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. investigated whether infusion
of autologous hematopoietic stem cells transduced vitro the
gamma(c) gene restore immune system patients severe combined
immunodeficiency.
methods: cd34+ bone marrow cells five boys x-linked severe combined
immunodeficiency transduced ex vivo use defective retroviral
vector. integration expression gamma(c) transgene development of
lymphocyte subgroups functions sequentially analyzed period
of 2.5 years gene transfer.
results: adverse effects resulted procedure. transduced cells and
natural killer cells appeared blood four five patients within
four months. numbers phenotypes cells, repertoire t-cell
receptors, vitro proliferative responses cells several
antigens immunization nearly normal two years treatment.
thymopoiesis documented presence naive cells t-cell
antigen-receptor episomes development normal-sized thymus gland. the
frequency transduced b cells low, serum immunoglobulin levels and
antibody production immunization sufficient avoid need for
intravenous immunoglobulin. correction immunodeficiency eradicated
established infections allowed patients normal life.
conclusions: ex vivo gene therapy gamma(c) safely correct immune
deficiency patients x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.
