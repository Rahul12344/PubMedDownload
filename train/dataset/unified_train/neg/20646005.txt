the cellular changes ageing incompletely understood yet immune system 
dysfunction implicated age-related decline health. acquired
immune system shows functional decline ability respond new pathogens
whereas serum levels cytokines elevated age. despite these
age-associated increases circulating cytokines, function aged
macrophages decreased. pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors as
toll-like receptors (tlrs) vital response macrophages to
pathological stimuli. review evidence defective tlr signalling in
normal ageing. gene transcription, protein expression cell surface expression
of members tlr family receptors co-effector molecules show a
consistent age-dependent change across model systems. however, evidence 
for impaired downstream signalling events, including inhibition positive and
activation negative modulators tlr induced signalling events. paper
we hypothesize despite poor inflammatory response via tlr activation, 
ineffective clearance pathogens macrophages increases duration their
activation contributes perpetuation inflammatory responses ageing.
