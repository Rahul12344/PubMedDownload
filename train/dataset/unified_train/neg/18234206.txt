a new peptide-based elisa test developed detection anti-r7v specific
antibodies sera hiv seropositive patients described. hiv virus
acquires cellular antigen moment virus released budding, the
r7v epitope. certain patients produce anti-r7v ab described having
the capacity neutralize vitro cell infection hiv. anti-r7v ab also
detected asymptomatic patients lower likelihood progressing to
aids. tested 449 serum samples, prevalence anti-r7v ab 53.2% in
hiv positive patients 5.5% hiv negative subjects. according the
duration infection, seroprevalence reaches almost 80% non-treated
long-term infected patients. retrospective studies conducted 308
hiv positive samples; presence anti-r7v ab significantly higher for
177 asymptomatic patients (64.4%) compared 131 symptomatic patients
(35.1%). regarding neutralizing ability, anti-r7v antibodies detected 
at highest percentage asymptomatic hiv-infected patients naive of
treatment. besides conventional biological parameters (cd4 viral load), the
detection anti-r7v antibodies could proposed clinicians additional
tool manage treatment initiation improve psychological state of
their asymptomatic patients.
