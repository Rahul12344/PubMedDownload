incremental selection within population, defined limited fitness changes
following mutation, important aspect many evolutionary processes.
strongly advantageous deleterious mutations detected using synonymous 
to non-synonymous mutations ratio. however, currently precise
methods estimate incremental selection. provide first time
such detailed method show precision multiple cases of
micro-evolution. proposed method novel mixed lineage tree/sequence based
method detect within population selection defined effect of
mutations average number offspring. specifically, propose measure
the log ratio number leaves lineage trees branches
following synonymous non-synonymous mutations. method requires high
enough number sequences, large enough number independent mutations.
it assumes mutations independent events. require a
baseline model practically affected sampling biases. show the
method's wide applicability testing multiple cases micro-evolution.
we show detect genes inter-genic regions using selection rate
and detect selection pressures viral proteins immune response to
pathogens.
