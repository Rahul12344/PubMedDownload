b cell non-hodgkin lymphoma typical extrahepatic manifestation frequently
associated hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. mechanism hcv
infection leads lymphoproliferative disorder remains unclear. group
established hcv transgenic mice expressed full hcv genome b cells
(rzcd19cre mice). observed 25.0% incidence diffuse large b cell
non-hodgkin lymphomas (22.2% male 29.6% female mice) within 600 days of
birth. interestingly, rzcd19cre mice substantially elevated serum-soluble
interleukin-2 receptor α-subunit (sil-2rα) levels (>1000 pg/ml) developed b cell 
lymphomas. another mouse model lymphoproliferative disorder established by
persistent expression hcv structural proteins disruption interferon
regulatory factor-1 (irf-1(_/_)/cn2 mice). irf-1(_/_)/cn2 mice showed extremely
high incidences lymphomas lymphoproliferative disorders. moreover, these
mice showed increased levels interleukin (il)-2, il-10, bcl-2 well as
increased bcl-2 expression, promoted oncogenic transformation of
lymphocytes.
