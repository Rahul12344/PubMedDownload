intravaginal (ivag) infection mice herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2)
causes genital tissue damage, quickly followed development fatal
encephalopathy. delineate initial host responses generated hsv-2 infection,
here oligonucleotide microarrays compared gene expression vaginal tissue 
uninfected mice mice 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 days ivag infection with
10(4) pfu hsv-2. comparison mrna expression uninfected and
hsv-infected vaginal tissue detected changes first 2 days post
infection (dpi), 156 genes whose expression first significantly
altered 3 dpi remained significantly modified later time points
examined. 156 genes significantly enriched canonical pathways
associated interferon (ifn) signaling, activation ifn elements by
intracellular pattern recognition receptors, antiviral immunity induced by
cytosolic rig-like receptors. evaluation gene set national
center biotechnology information gene interferome databases corroborated 
pathway analysis, function (53%) linked ifn-mediated host
immunity. final set experiments, ivag administration toll-like
receptor 3 agonist polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid (poly i:c) 24â€‰h ivag
hsv-2 infection reduced incidence genital pathology encephalopathy,
while poly i:c-treated mice subsequently protected ocular hsv-2
challenge lethal uninfected controls. latter results imply the
exuberant antiviral immunity produced experimental model simply formed 
too late prevent viral replication dissemination, poly
i:c-induced formation antiviral state protecting primary ivag
infection also permits development hsv-specific protective immunity.
