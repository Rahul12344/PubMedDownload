peste des petits ruminants emerging, often fatal viral disease domestic 
and wild small ruminants caused peste des petits ruminants virus. the
haemagglutinin fusion protein viral envelope glycoproteins and
essential infection process induce protective immune response 
in infected vaccinated animals. attempts generate pseudotyped bovine
herpesvirus 1 recombinants firstly integration expression cassettes for
pprv-h pprv-f herpesviral genome secondly generate pseudotyped
bhv-1 genetically fusing relevant parts pprv glycoproteins the
amino-terminal subunit glycoprotein b, approaches successful for
heterologous viral membrane glycoproteins past, failed repeatedly. we
therefore analyzed intracellular stage generation viable
bhv-1 hybrid-gb recombinants might inhibited. results obtained transient 
protein expression experiments revealed that, dependent fusion protein,
transport hybrid glycoproteins beyond endoplasmic reticulum is
impeded. thus, expression heterologous glycoproteins using bhv-1 interferes
more expected published experience bhv-1 gb transport and
consequently virus replication.
