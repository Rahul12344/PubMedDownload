the cellular receptor subgroup b avian leukosis virus (alvb) encoded a
gene tumour virus b (tvb) locus. tvb alleles encode specific receptors
permitting infection exogenous alvb avian leukosis virus subgroup (alvd) 
as well endogenous avian leukosis virus subgroup e (alve), thus
susceptibility dominant resistance. two single nucleotide polymorphisms 
the tvb locus reported distinguishing three tvb alleles (tvb*s1, tvb*s3
and tvb*r). developed polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment
length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) assay using two single nucleotide
polymorphisms define three observed allelic haplotypes identify six
possible tvb genotypes consisting three haplotypes defined laboratory
strains chickens. one additional potential allelic haplotype four
genotypes also briefly discussed. chickens parents heterozygous for
different tvb alleles challenged rous sarcoma viruses subgroup alvb 
and alve induce wing-web tumours. tumour incidences evaluated between
chickens genotypes determined newly developed pcr-rflp assay.
importantly, chickens typed assay tvb*s3/*s3 resistant to
infection alve only, tvb*r/*r resistant alve alvb. 
furthermore, vast majority chickens susceptible tvb*s1/- genotypes 
developed tumour. pcr-rflp assay enables relatively rapid assessment 
all six anticipated tvb genotypes experimental strains chickens undergoing 
segregation tvb*s1, tvb*s3, tvb*r alleles. non-infectious assay
should evaluated capacity select breed commercial
chickens genetic resistance infections alvb, alvd alve.
