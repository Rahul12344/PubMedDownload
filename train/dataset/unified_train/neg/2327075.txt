the sim gene bacteriophage p1 causes exclusion superinfecting p1 phage.
we determined nucleotide sequence 1.9-kb dna fragment that, plasmids,
causes sim phenotype. two open reading frames within region for
proteins 82 259 amino acids. 1.3-kb fragment containing larger open 
reading frame inserted expression vector. induced cells carrying 
hybrid plasmid, termed pbd5, infected phage p1 produced 24-kda 
protein and, smaller extent, 25-kda protein. 24-kda protein was
purified. comparison amino-terminal amino acid sequence the
nucleotide sequence indicated processed precursor protein by
removal hydrophobic leader peptide 20 amino acids. vivo processing
depends seca gene function necessary sim interference p1
infection. data discussed respect function sim gene in
superinfection exclusion.
