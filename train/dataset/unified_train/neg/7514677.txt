the nucleoprotein (np) influenza virus dominant antigen recognized by
influenza virus-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls), adoptive transfer of
np-specific ctls protects mice influenza virus infection. balb/c mouse
cells (h-2d) recognize single kd-restricted ctl epitope np consisting of
amino acids 147 155. present study, mice immunized various
vaccinia virus recombinant viruses examine effect induction of
primary pulmonary ctls resistance challenge influenza a/puerto
rico/8/34 virus. minigene esnp(147-155)-vac construct, composed signal
sequence adenovirus e3/19k glycoprotein (designated es) expressing
the 9-amino-acid np natural determinant (amino acids 147 155) preceded an
alanine residue, similar minigene np(met 147-155)-vac lacking es, a
full-length np-vac recombinant influenza virus analyzed. two minigene
np-vac recombinants induced greater primary pulmonary ctl response the
full-length np-vac recombinant. however, np-specific ctls induced immunization
with esnp(147-155)-vac decrease peak virus titer accelerate clearance 
of virus lungs mice challenged intranasally a/pr/8/34.
furthermore, np-specific ctls induced immunization protect mice
challenged intranasally lethal dose a/pr/8/34. sequence analysis the
np ctl epitope a/pr/8/34 challenge virus obtained lungs 8 days of
replication esnp(147-155)-vac-immunized mice showed identity 
input virus, demonstrating escape mutant emerged during
replication vivo. thus, contrast adoptively transferred ctls, pulmonary 
np-specific ctls induced recombinant vaccinia virus immunization have
protective vivo antiviral activity influenza virus infection.
