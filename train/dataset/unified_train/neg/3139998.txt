promoter providing gene expression logarithmic growth phase cat gene
of plasmid pc194 (ac fragment) inserted thermoinducible prophage phi
105 cts139. possibility amylolytic activity enhancement studied after
thermoinduction. ac fragment random psti restricts phage dna were
ligated used transform bacillus subtilis 1a289 (phi 105 cts139) amy+
cmr transformants obtained different levels increased
amylolytic activity (maximum--26 fold). numerous phages without insert found in
induced lysates suggest insertions unstable (or) clones were
double lysogens hybrid original type phages. stable insertion ac
fragment replacing psti-h-fragment phage dna revealed amy+ cmr
transformants double lysogens. inducibility depended insertion
orientation.
