in study, administered specially developed chitosan/alginate nanoparticle
encapsulated bv (ch/al-bv) slow-releasing properties mucosal
adhesiveness pig via nasal route evaluate whether facilitate
systemic immune response improve clearance porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv). ch/al-bv-administered group prrsv
vaccination showed significantly enhanced th1-related responses including high 
population cd4+ lymphocyte cytokine mrna levels including
interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) interleukin (il)-12 increased prrsv-specific igg
levels. prrsv challenge experiment, ch/al-bv group showed a
significant decrease viral burden sera tissues (lung bronchial 
lymph node) mild interstitial pneumonia signs lung gross examination 
and microscopic evaluation high levels prrsv-specific igg viral
neutralizing antibody. ch/al-bv also effectively induced th1-related
immune responses including increase portion cd4+ lymphocyte, cytokines
(ifn-γ il-12), transcriptional factors (stat4 t-bet), also
stimulated ifn-γ-secreting cell families cd4+ lymphocytes th/memory
cells. interestingly, ch/al-bv group showed decrease prrsv-specific
immune-suppressive actions, including regulatory cell population its
related cytokines (il-10 tgf-β) transcriptional factors (stat5 and
foxp3). therefore, nasal-delivered ch/al-bv may effectively induce non-specific
immune stimulating actions, particularly related th1 responses viral
clearance activities prrsv infection. based results, ch/al-bv
could promising strategy overcoming disadvantages classical prrsv
vaccination applied preventive agent prrsv other
viral diseases, particularly immune-suppressive characteristics.
