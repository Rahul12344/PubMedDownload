currently, serological assays grass carp reovirus genotype ii (gcrv-ii)
diagnosis available. study, indirect enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) detection antibodies gcrv-ii was
developed. structural protein vp38 gcrv-ii used coating
antigen. monoclonal antibodies (mab) igm grass carp labelled hrp 
were used secondary antibody. antigen concentration serum dilution
were optimized using chess board titration. furthermore, specificity of
indirect elisa assay confirmed cross check sera positive other
grass carp pathogens. comparison results obtained indirect
immunofluorescence assay (ifa) western blot testing 60 serum samples to
evaluate sensitivity specificity elisa, agreement 90% 
96.7% reached, respectively. serological survey performed using the
assay grass carp field serum samples. seropositive rate 242 serum
samples 69.8%. conclusion, developed indirect elisa specific
and sensitive test useful large-scale serological surveys to
detect indirectly gcrv ii infections well monitor changes of
antibody level immunization.
