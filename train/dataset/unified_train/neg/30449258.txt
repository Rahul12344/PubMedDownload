ebola dangerous virus transmitted animals humans date is
no curable agent deadly infectious disease. study,
pharmacoinformatics-based methods adopted find effective novel chemical
entities ebola virus. well predictive statistical robust
pharmacophore model developed known ebola virus inhibitors collected
from literature. model explained significance hydrogen
bond acceptor donor, two hydrophobic regions activity. national
cancer institute asinex (antiviral library) databases screened using the
final validated pharmacophore model. initial hits screened a
set criteria finally eight molecules databases proposed 
promising anti ebola agents. molecular docking molecular dynamics
studies carried found proposed molecules possessed
capability interact amino residues ebola protein well retaining 
equilibrium protein-ligand systems. finally, binding energies were
calculated using molecular mechanics poisson-boltzmann surface area approach 
all proposed molecules showed strong binding affinity towards ebola protein
receptor. communicated ramaswamy h. sarma.
