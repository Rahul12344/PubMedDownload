in addition muscle changes due peripheral nervous system involvement,
primary myopathic changes associated human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) 
have also described. studied seven cases: two developed acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids), four seroconverted hiv were
otherwise asymptomatic, one hiv seronegative biopsy performed
and one biopsied twice. besides hiv infectious agent was
detected. muscle biopsies showed: (a) muscle fiber necrosis regeneration; (b)
inflammatory changes moderate perivascular infiltration; (c) unusual
myofibrillary disorganization. immunocytochemical techniques using anti-hiv
monoclonal antibodies showed presence virus one biopsy. hiv-rna was
detected situ hybridization biopsy. techniques the
hiv detected isolated mononuclear cells muscle endomysium not
within muscle fibers. muscle involvement associated hiv infection may be
related, least cases, presence virus interstitial
cells.
