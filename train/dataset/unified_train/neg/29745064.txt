the molecular basis inhibitory action benzimidazole inhibitor
compound hepatitis c virus e1 envelope protein examined computationally.
structures wild-type e1 protein seven mutants modelled using 
ab initio protein structure prediction algorithm, models docked
with benzimidazole inhibitor. top-ranked conformers docked structure
were examined context putative function inhibitor that
blocks fusion envelope protein host cells. results the
wild-type protein series mutants containing reported single,
double triple resistance mutations demonstrate inhibitor binds in
the vicinity residue phe99 (at position 291 encoded polyprotein) the
c-terminal end putative fusion domain. doing, compound inhibits
the virus fusing host cells blocks viral replication accord with
the results cell-based infection studies.
