caprine arthritis-encephalitis (cae) goats complex disease syndrome
caused lentivirus. persistent viral infection results arthritis in
adult goats encephalitis lambs. prognosis encephalitic form is
normally poor, form disease caused substantial economic
losses goat farmers. hence, efficient detection platform based on
recombinase polymerase amplification (rpa) lateral flow dipstick (lfd) 
developed present study detecting proviral dna caprine
arthritis-encephalitis virus (caev). optimal incubation conditions,
specifically, 30min 37°c rpa followed 5min room temperature lfd,
the assay found sensitive lower limit 80pg total dna 10 
copies plasmid dna. furthermore, cross-reaction tested
viruses, including goat pox virus bovine leukemia virus. given simplicity
and portability, rpa-lfd protocol serve alternative tool elisa 
for primary screening caev, one suitable laboratory and
field application. rpa-lfd applied parallel serological
elisa detection caev field samples, rpa-lfd assay exhibited a
higher sensitivity traditional method, 82% 200 samples
collected taiwan found positive. knowledge, the
first report providing evidence support use rpa-lfd assay a
specific sensitive platform detecting caev proviral dna goats a
faster manner, one also applicable on-site utilization farms and
that useful eradication programs epidemiological studies.
