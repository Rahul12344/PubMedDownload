measles virus antigens covalently linked latex spheres used measuring
measles-specific antibodies direct agglutination test either microtitre
plates rapid slide-agglutination test. titres compared that
obtained conventional assays. measles-latex spheres also used 
antigen radio-immuno assay. incorporating 14c-radioactive marker 
the measles-latex spheres interaction lymphocytes multiple
sclerosis control patients determined. lymphocytes multiple
sclerosis patients reacted higher percentage beads low
bead/lymphocyte ratios compared controls, whereas reverse found when
the ratio beads increased.
