myxomatosis major viral disease european rabbit (oryctolagus
cuniculus). two forms disease (nodular amyxomatous) exist. the
clinical diagnosis nodular form easily performed basis of
typical skin lesions whereas amyxomatous forms must based virus
isolation detection specific antibodies myxoma virus (mv). the
seroprevalence mv studied march 1998 february 1999 16 farms
from three european countries considered free myxomatosis basis 
absence typical clinical signs. mv antibodies detected enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) (sensitivity 100%, specificity 90%) 16 farms; 
the seroprevalences corrected test inaccuracy (95% confidence interval) 
55+/-7.7% 37+/-6.1% broilers, respectively. association
between herd sizes, types rabbitries, presence recurrent respiratory or
digestive troubles seroprevalence mv antibodies tested logistic
multiple regressions. models, seroprevalence mv antibodies was
significantly higher herds (does broilers) recurrent respiratory or
digestive troubles herds without problems. seroprevalence was
also higher herds (does broilers) animals housed totally or
partially outdoors rabbitries totally enclosed rabbitries. effect 
of herd sizes presence mv antibodies broilers;
intermediate sizes lower risk smaller larger ones.
