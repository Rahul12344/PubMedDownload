influenza virus pandemics rare events caused novel viruses have
the ability spread susceptible human populations. respect h1
subtype viruses, swine h1n1 h1n2 viruses occasionally cross species
barrier cause human infection. recently isolated humans (termed
variants), swine viruses shown display great genetic antigenic
diversity, hence posing considerable public health risk. here, utilized in
vitro vivo approaches provide characterization h1 subtype variant
viruses isolated since 2009 pandemic discuss findings context with
previously studied h1 subtype human isolates. variant viruses well

of classical swine triple-reassortant h1 isolates rather viruses

isolates, tested variant viruses capable efficient transmission
between cohoused ferrets could transmit via respiratory droplets differing
degrees. overall, investigation demonstrates swine h1 viruses that
infected humans possess adaptations required robust replication and, 
cases, efficient respiratory droplet transmission mammalian model and
therefore need closely monitored additional molecular changes that
could facilitate transmission among humans. work highlights need for
