background: adenovirus type-5 (ad5) recombinant viruses replacement the
1.9 kb xbai fragment early region 3 (e3) foreign genes been
constructed ultimate goal inducing immune responses product of
the inserted gene variety virus infections. pathogenicity of
these recombinants, however, studied.
experimental design: histopathologic changes induced cotton rat mouse lung
by e3-replacement-ad5 recombinant wild-type ad (wt-ad) e3-deleted mutant
(ad5-delta e3) viruses compared. expression viral mrna replication of
these viruses cotton rat mouse lungs, well human tissue culture
cells, assayed. expression class major histocompatibility complex
antigens e3-14.7 kilodalton protein virus-infected cells also
analyzed.
results: ad5 recombinant, ad-human cytomegalovirus glycoprotein b
(ad-hcmv.gb), e3 region replaced full-length gb gene of
hcmv genome size exceeding wt-ad, induced mild histopathologic
responses cotton rat mouse lungs, comparable wt-ad, less
severe ad5-delta e3. analysis indicated neither class major 
histocompatibility complex expression cell surface differential
expression protective e3-14.7 kilodalton protein underlies pathologic 
differences observed cells infected ad5-delta e3 ad-hcmv.gb
recombinant. mouse lung, another ad-e3 replacement recombinant, ad-herpes 
simplex glycoprotein b (hsv.gb), containing complete hsv.gb gene a
genome size larger wt-ad, also induced mild inflammatory
response. however, two recombinants truncated forms hcmv.gb
(ad-hcmv.gb.155) hsv.gb genes (ad-hsv.gb.147) produced severe
histopathologic changes wt-ad recombinants full
complement hcmv.gb hsv.gb genes. ad5 recombinants
replicated mouse cotton rat lung, extent replication was
inversely proportional genome size, lung human tissue
culture cells. infectious virus titers were, however, higher cotton rat than
in mouse lung. situ hybridization analysis cotton rat mouse lung
infected wt-ad, ad5-delta e3, ad-hcmv.gb virus revealed expression ad 
early/late mrna predominantly bronchial epithelial cells.
conclusions: data confirm e3-deleted viruses induce more
severe pathologic changes cotton rat lungs wt-ad viruses (ginsberg et
al., proc natl acad sci usa 1989;86:3823-7) led observation 
e3 replacement recombinants also lacking expression 19 14.7
kilodalton proteins significantly less pathogenic cotton rats mice
than e3-deleted virus. pathogenicity replication recombinant
viruses inversely correlate genomic size.
