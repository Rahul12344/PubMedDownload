the mechanism bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1) predisposes cattle to
bacterial pneumonia investigated using vitro system demonstrate
immunosuppression. multiplicity infection 0.001, live inactivated
bhv-1 induced 50% inhibition proliferative response peripheral blood 
mononuclear leukocytes antigen (vaccinia virus vaccinia virus-immunized
cattle bhv-1 negative) interleukin-2. multiplicity 
infection, mitogen-induced proliferation peripheral blood mononuclear
leukocytes unaffected. inhibition antigen interleukin-2-induced
proliferative responses could reversed addition excess amounts
of interleukin-2 could prevented addition indomethacin to
block prostaglandin production. antibodies bhv-1, especially specific
for glycoproteins gi giv, able block inhibitory effect bhv-1
in vitro assays. results showed antibody bhv-1 blocks 
immunosuppressive effect virus vitro suggested appropriate 
antibody response bhv-1 could protect cattle virus-induced
immunosuppression leading secondary bacterial pneumonia.
