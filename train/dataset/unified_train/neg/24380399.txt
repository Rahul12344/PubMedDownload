redirection adenovirus vectors engineering capsid-coding region has
shown limited success proper targeting ligands generally unknown. 
overcome limitation, constructed adenovirus library displaying random 
peptides fiber knob, screening led successful selections of
several particular targeted vectors. previous library construction method,
the full length adenoviral genome generated cre-lox mediated in
vitro recombination fiber-modified plasmid library the
enzyme-digested adenoviral dna/terminal protein complex (dna-tpc) before
transfection producer cells. system, procedures were
complicated time-consuming, approximately 30% vectors the
library defective displaying peptide. may hinder further
extensive exploration cancer-targeting vectors. resolve problems, 
this study, developed novel method transfection fiber-modified
plasmid library fiberless adenoviral dna-tpc cre-expressing 293 cells.
the use in-cell cre recombination fiberless adenovirus greatly simplified 
the library-making steps. fiberless adenovirus useful suppressing 
expansion unnecessary adenovirus vectors. addition, complexity the
library 10(4) level one well 6-well dish, was
10-fold higher original method. results demonstrated that
this novel method useful producing high quality live adenovirus library, 
which could facilitate development targeted adenovirus vectors a
variety applications medicine.
