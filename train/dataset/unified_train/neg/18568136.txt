aim: current study aims assess role histological parameters 
liver biopsy explaining variance liver stiffness, well the
performance transient elastography quantifying liver fibrosis patients
with chronic hepatitis c.
methods: 324 consecutive chc patients prospectively included study. 
all positive hcv-rna serum underwent percutaneous liver
biopsy grading staging diseases (metavir scoring system). were
referred liver stiffness measurement 1 day prior biopsy.
results: liver stiffness values strongly correlated fibrosis (r=0.759, 
p<0.0005). also correlated steatosis (r=0.255, p<0.0005),
necroinflammatory activity (r=0.378, p<0.0005) hepatic iron deposition
(r=0.143, p=0.03). univariate regression analysis demonstrated fibrosis 
(sq.r=0.610, p<0.0005), activity (sq.r=0.145, p<0.0005) steatosis
(sq.r=0.037, p=0.002) correlated liver stiffness. multiple
regression analysis, three variables independently influenced liver
stiffness: fibrosis (p<0.0005), activity (p=0.039) steatosis (p=0.025).
together explained 62.4% variance liver stiffness. areas
under roc curve diagnosis fibrosis f > =1, f > =2, f > =3,
and f=4 0.936, 0.862, 0.910 0.938, cut-off values 4.9 kpa,
7.4 kpa, 9.1 kpa 11.85 kpa respectively.
conclusions: transient elastography useful method chronic hepatitis c
assessment. fibrosis main predictor liver stiffness, activity and
steatosis also influence liver stiffness.
