expression hepatitis b virus x gene mammalian cells.

siddiqui a, jameel s, mapoles j.

the hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna contains open reading frame (orf) designated
x, capacity encode protein 16,560 da (subtype adw). 
protein identified either hbv particles infected human livers,
and therefore role viral life cycle remains unknown. report here
the expression hbv x orf cultured cells using recombinant vectors. a
protein 16 kda identified means antiserum prepared a
synthetic peptide human antisera hepatitis b patients well as
those hepatocellular carcinoma. cell fractionation immunofluorescence
studies suggest probable association cytoskeletal components. studies 
further located promoter sequence upstream x orf, directs the
transcription 0.7- 0.8-kilobase x-specific rna transfected human
hepatoma cells.
