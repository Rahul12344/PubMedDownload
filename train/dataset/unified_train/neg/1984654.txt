the effects transfer movement gene tobamoviruses tobacco
mosaic virus (tmv) tobacco mild green mosaic virus (tmgmv) studied. 
movement protein (mp) gene tmgmv cloned infectious cdna tmv 
build recombinant virus v23. v23, like tmv tmgmv, caused systemic
infection nicotiana tabacum xanthi. n. sylvestris v23 tmv spread
systemically although tmgmv produces necrotic local lesions host. v23 and
tmv cause systemic infection tomato plants tmgmv infect tomato.
in xanthi nc plants, v23 produced necrotic local lesions similar size those
produced tmgmv. hand transgenic xanthi nc tobacco plants 
express gene encoding mp tmv necrotic lesions produced v23 and
tmgmv similar size produced tmv. results indicate 
the size necrotic lesions produced tmgmv tmv xanthi nc plants is
influenced mp gene.
