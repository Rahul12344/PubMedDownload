alphaviruses, chikungunya virus, o'nyong-nyong virus, ross river
virus (rrv), cause outbreaks human rheumatic disease worldwide. rrv a
positive-sense single-stranded rna virus endemic australia papua new
guinea. study, sought establish vitro model rrv evolution 
in response cellular antiviral defense mechanisms. rrv able establish
persistent infection activated macrophages, small-plaque variant
(rrv(pers)) isolated several weeks culture. nucleotide sequence
analysis rrv(pers) found several nucleotide differences nonstructural
protein (nsp) region rrv(pers) genome. point mutation also detected 
in e2 gene. compared parent virus (rrv-t48), rrv(pers) showed
significantly enhanced resistance beta interferon (ifn-β)-stimulated antiviral
activity. rrv(pers) infection raw 264.7 macrophages induced lower levels of
ifn-β expression production infection rrv-t48. rrv(pers) also
able inhibit type ifn signaling. mice infected rrv(pers) exhibited
significantly enhanced disease severity mortality compared mice infected
with rrv-t48. results provide strong evidence cellular antiviral
response direct selective pressure viral sequence evolution impacts 
on virus fitness sensitivity alpha/beta ifn (ifn-α/β).
