changes use antiretroviral drugs factors associated changes
from monotherapy zidovudine (zdv) regimens quantified the
multicenter aids cohort study. participants receiving monotherapy
with zdv categorized (1) discontinuing zdv monotherapy; (2) switching 
disanosine (ddi), zalcitabine (ddc), stavudine (d4t) monotherapy; (3)
switching combination therapy (zdv ddi, ddc, d4t); (4) continuing
zdv monotherapy. 1990 1994, percentage participants using zdv
monotherapy decreased 27% 17% (among participants without aids) 
60% 17% (among aids). time, proportion of
participants using combination therapy increased zero 8% (no aids) and
from 8% 26% (aids). polychotomous logistic regression methods used to
identify factors predicting changes zdv monotherapy. among participants 
without aids, indicators drug failure (such lower cd4 lymphocyte count or
symptoms human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection) predictive the
initiation combination therapy, among patients aids were
predictive switch alternative monotherapy. decrease hemoglobin
levels, marker zdv toxicity, predictive patients switch 
other monotherapy. data show clinicians patients opting for
more aggressive antiretroviral regiments changes cd4 lymphocyte count
and status symptoms remain primary guides changes therapy.
