the motif peptide binding monoclonal antibody mab a16, known to
be directed glycoprotein herpes simplex virus type 1, determined
using two dedicated peptide libraries. starting point study used
an a-16 binding lead sequence, previously obtained phage
display peptide library (schellekens et al., 1994). binding studies with
different length variants peptide identified 12mer suitable lead
compound library study. two incomplete dedicated resin-bound synthetic
peptide libraries generated. consisted 2 x 10(6) 12mers, which
positions alternately fixed (amino acids identical lead sequence) and
random. libraries screened mab a16 beads binding peptides 
were sequenced using edman degradation. resulted unique peptide binding
motif, essentially comprising 7mer core sequence. comparison sequence of
the natural epitope binding motif revealed sequence was
identical motif except one position. substitution methionine in
the natural epitope tyrosine phenylalanine position, as
dictated motif, resulted peptide affinity binding mab 
a16 50 times higher natural epitope. thus, lead
sequence available, use incomplete, dedicated synthetic peptide
libraries provides fast powerful tool detection high affinity
peptides.
