acid polymerase.

polynucleotide templates copied avian myeloblastosis virus dna polymerase
("reverse transcriptase") frequency distribution errors were
determined. error rate [r(pa)2500-d(pt)12-18] template-initiator a
variety conditions approximately 1/600, i.e. one incorrect dcmp
incorporated 600 correct dtmp polymerized. addition metal chelator
o-phenanthroline reaction inhibited incorporation correct and
incorrect nucleotides proportionately. enzyme inhibited ph optimum 8.5
and error rate remained constant range ph (6.0 10.0). rate
of polymerization greater higher temperatures approximately doubled
for every 10 degrees increase. error rate constant temperatures.
these results indicate purified avian myeloblastosis virus dna
polymerase synthesizes polydeoxynucleotides unusually large number of
errors base-pairing. velocity sedimentation products reaction
obtained various times course synthesis indicate that: (a) the
entire length 14 template copied, (b) incorporation the
incorrect nucleotide terminate chain propagation. isopyknic banding in
neutral alkaline cesium sulfate gradients showed noncomplementary
nucleotides incorporated polydeoxynucleotide product. stepwise
degradation nearest neighbor analysis reaction product indicated 
(a) correct incorrect nucleotides present phosphodiester linkages,
(b) errors concentrated either termini; (c) errors are
uniformly distributed throughout newly synthesized polydeoxynucleotide.
