recent technological advances revolutionised capacity induce
cytotoxic lymphocyte (ctl) responses variety vaccine formulations and
delivery systems. however, conditions required ctl-inducing vaccine 
provide protection infection disease poorly understood, the
results challenge experiments consistent. use a
mathematical model examine requirements necessary successful
vaccination human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) cellular immunity.
we describe interaction cytotoxic cells infected lymphocytes,
capturing essence persistent infection immune cells. conclude that
to protect infection, cellular immune response boosted to
levels exceeding chronic infection. requires either effector
ctl exceed threshold infection, memory ctl population is
established yield level effector ctl quickly upon
infection.
