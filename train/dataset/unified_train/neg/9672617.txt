human calicivirus sapporo (sv) typical calicivirus morphology causes
acute gastroenteritis children. nucleotide sequence 3.2 kb 3'
end sv determined cloned cdna. 3' end sv genome is
predicted encode rna-dependent rna polymerase region, capsid protein
and two small open reading frames. nonstructural capsid protein coding
sequences sv genome fused single open reading frame. the
organization proteins sv sequence similar rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus recently described manchester virus, and
distinct genome organization prototype human calicivirus, norwalk
virus, lacks typical calicivirus morphology described a
small round structured virus (srsv). sequence analysis predicted capsid
region showed sv capsid longer approximately 30 amino acids than
the capsid srsvs, multiple sequence alignments showed that
these additional amino acids located variable region capsid
protein. expression capsid protein sv insect cells resulted the
self-assembly virus-like particles morphology similar of
the native virus. result shows calicivirus morphology determined 
the primary sequence capsid protein.
