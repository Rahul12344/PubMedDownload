the epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent-to-lytic switch mediated viral
proteins bzlf1 (z), brlf1 (r), brrf1 (na). since previously showed that
dna-damaging agents (including chemotherapy irradiation) induce ebv lytic
reactivation recently demonstrated wild-type p53 contributes lytic
reactivation, investigated role atm kinase ebv reactivation.
atm phosphorylates activates p53, well numerous substrates
involved cellular dna damage response. using atm inhibitor (ku55933),
we found atm activity required efficient induction ebv lytic gene 
expression variety different stimuli, including histone deacetylase
(hdac) inhibitor, transforming growth factor β (tgf-β) cytokine, a
demethylating agent (5-azacytidine), b cell receptor engagement anti-igg
antibody, hydrogen peroxide, proteosome inhibitor bortezomib. in
ebv-infected ags (gastric) cells, knockdown atm, p53, expression inhibits
ebv reactivation. conversely, treatment cells nutlin-3 (which
activates p53 atm) robustly induces lytic reactivation p53- and
atm-dependent manner. ability ebv r na proteins induce lytic
reactivation ebv-infected ags cells atm dependent. however, overexpression 
of z induces lytic gene expression presence absence atm activity.
our results suggest atm enhances z promoter activity context the
intact ebv genome p53 contributes atm effect. nevertheless, since
we found atm inhibitors also reduce lytic reactivation burkitt lymphoma
cells p53, additional atm substrates must also contribute atm
effect.
