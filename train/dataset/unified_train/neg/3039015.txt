recombinant human interferon-alpha (rifn-alpha a) evaluated therapeutic
efficacy experimental dorsal cutaneous herpes simplex virus type 1
(hsv-1) infection guinea pigs. human ifn activity species. animals
were treated either systemically (i.m.) topically different formulations 
of rifn-alpha a. therapy initiated 24 h (-24 h), 30 min (+0.5
h), 24 h following (+24 h) virus inoculation, treatment continued 
3-5 days. efficacy evaluated day 4 following infection. treatment with
rifn-alpha given systemically beginning -24 h effective, reducing lesion
number, total lesion area, lesion virus titer 64%, 85%, 98%
respectively (p less 0.001). efficacy diminished delay initiation of
i.m. therapy. topical rifn-alpha formulations generally ineffective,
showing marginal effect therapy initiated -24 h +0.5 h no
effect treatment delayed +24 h. summary, rifn-alpha effective
against cutaneous hsv-1 infection model therapy initiated
prophylactically drug delivery assured systemic injection. topical
application rifn-alpha showed little therapeutic effect. large molecular
weight ifn likely retards percutaneous delivery.
