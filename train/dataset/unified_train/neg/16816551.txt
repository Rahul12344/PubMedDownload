objectives: establishment vitro model evaluate rectal safety 
efficacy microbicide candidates.
design: investigation characterization human colorectal explant culture
for screening candidate microbicides prevent rectal transmission hiv-1
infection.
methods: human colorectal explants cultured liquid-air interface on
gelfoam rafts. phenotypic characterization hiv-1 target cells performed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. hiv-1 infection determined by
the measurement p24 antigen release, viral rna, proviral dna accumulation.
results: colorectal explant cd4 cells expressed higher ccr5 cxcr4 levels
compared blood. minor differences rectal sigmoid colon 
observed trend slightly higher ccr5 hla-dr expression cells
from sigmoid colon. favourable culture conditions established for
colorectal tissue. although tissue structure degenerated time, cd4: cd8 cell
ratios remained constant, tissue supported productive hiv-1 infection. the
ability candidate microbicides inhibit r5 hiv-1 infection evaluated.
polyanion candidates, pro2000 dextrin sulphate, provided 99% protection 1 
microg/ml 1 mg/ml, respectively, equivalent 1/5000 1/40 vaginal
formulations. nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nrti)
9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (pmpa) provided protection at
concentrations 1000-fold lower (10 microg/ml) proposed vaginal
formulation (1%). furthermore, non-nrti uc-781 tmc-120 provided greater 
99% inhibition 3.3 0.33 microg/ml, respectively. products demonstrated
toxicity rectal mucosa inhibitory concentrations.
conclusion: colorectal explant culture shown useful tool the
preclinical evaluation potential microbicides. data suggest rectally 
applied microbicides might provide protection hiv-1 transmission.
