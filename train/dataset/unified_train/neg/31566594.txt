neutrophil granulocytes, also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) due to
their lobulated nucleus, abundant type leukocytes. mature in
the bone marrow released peripheral blood, circulate 
for 6-8 h; however, tissue, survive days. diapedesis
through endothelium, leave blood stream, enter tissues, migrate 
towards site infection following chemotactic gradients. neutrophils can
combat invading microorganisms phagocytosis, degranulation, generation 
neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). protocol help detect nets 
paraffin-embedded tissue. nets result process called netosis, 
leads release nuclear, granular, cytoplasmic components either from
living (vital netosis) dying (suicidal netosis) neutrophils. vitro, nets
form cloud-like structures, occupy space several times larger that
of cells descended. backbone nets chromatin, to
which selection proteins peptides originating granules and
cytoplasm bound. thereby, high local concentration toxic compounds is
maintained nets capture inactivate variety pathogens
including bacteria, fungi, viruses, parasites, diffusion highly 
active net components leading damage neighboring tissue limited.
nevertheless, recent years become apparent nets, generated in
abundance cleared insufficiently, pathological potential ranging 
autoimmune diseases cancer. thus, detection nets tissue samples may have
diagnostic significance, detection nets diseased tissue can
influence treatment patients. since paraffin-embedded tissue samples are
the standard specimen used pathological analysis, sought establish 
a protocol fluorescent staining net components paraffin-embedded tissue
using commercially available antibodies.
