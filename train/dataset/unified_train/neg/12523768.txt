three human enteric viruses (poliovirus, echovirus, coxsackievirus) suspended 
seawater buffer stable 6 hr absence sunlight were
inactivated rate presence sunlight. summer sunlight
conditions, least 3 logs viruses inactivated one-hit kinetics
while winter sunlight conditions 1 log viruses was
inactivated two-hit kinetics. conditions, 6 logs e. coli
were inactivated within 1 hr one-hit kinetics summer winter
conditions. comparison, e. faecalis inactivated two-hit kinetics and
only 2.5 logs inactivation observed 4 hr exposure winter
sunlight. since human enteric viruses considerably resistant sunlight
inactivation e. coli moderately resistant e. faecalis, marine 
recreational water quality standards based concentrations of
enterococci coliform bacteria. since mechanism rate of
inactivation coliphage human enteric viruses similar, coliphages
appear best indicator presence human enteric viruses in
recreational waters, especially coastal waters abundant sunshine is
available.
