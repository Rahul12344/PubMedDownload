light electron microscopic observation 3--4 days microinjection of
herpes simplex virus (hsv) left neostriatum rat demonstrated the
following results. (1) virus labeled nerve cells found ipsilateral
substantia nigra; large number infected neurons zona compacta
and zona reticulata. virus infection evident the
contralateral side. (2) virus labeled neurons found cortex, greater
number ipsilaterally contralaterally, dorsal raphé nuclei.
cortical microinjection hsv led infection cortical cells no
neostriatal cells. conclude, therefore, spread virus the
cortex, substantia nigra dorsal raphé following neostriatal injection
was retrograde axonal transport. (3) left neostriatum, hsv was
injected, showed surprisingly small number virus infected neurons. the
infected neurons mostly large neurons; majority medium sized
neurons well preserved. massive degeneration nerve terminals
throughout neuropil. degenerating nerve terminals are
considered afferent fibers.
