common carp, cyprinus carpio l., exposed koi herpesvirus (khv) may become
persistently infected populations containing virus-infected individuals 
may transmit virus fish co-habited. detection virus-infected
fish population thus critical surveillance control programmes 
khv. study therefore designed detect anti-khv serum antibodies, 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, common carp following experimental
exposures khv varying environmental conditions. study determined
that proportion fish within population experimentally exposed khv (at
least 10-25%) develop high antibody titres (1/1600 greater) virus, 
this immunological response detectable several months (observed the
termination experiments 65, 46 27 weeks post-exposure).
furthermore, response detected one population fish not
succumb high level mortality maintained water temperatures that
were non-permissive khv. elevating water temperatures permissive
conditions khv resulted recurrence disease despite presence of
anti-virus antibodies, suggesting serum antibodies alone protective 
under conditions trials.
