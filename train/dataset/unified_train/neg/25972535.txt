hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a) essential hcv
genome replication virion production involved regulation of
multiple host signaling pathways. proline-rich protein, ns5a capable of
interacting various host proteins containing src homology 3 (sh3) domains.
previous studies suggested vinexin, member sorbin homology
(soho) adaptor family, might potential binding partner ns5a yeast
two-hybrid screening. however, firm evidence interaction lacking, and
the significance vinexin hcv life cycle remains unclear. study,
we demonstrated endogenously exogenously expressed vinexin β
coimmunoprecipitated ns5a derived different hcv genotypes. two
residues, tryptophan (w307) tyrosine (y325), third sh3 domain of
vinexin β conserved pro-x-x-pro-x-arg motifs c terminus ns5a were
indispensable vinexin-ns5a interaction. furthermore, downregulation of
endogenous vinexin β significantly suppressed ns5a hyperphosphorylation and
decreased hcv replication, could rescued expressing vinexin β short
hairpin rna-resistant mutant. also found vinexin β modulated the
hyperphosphorylation ns5a casein kinase 1α-dependent manner. taken
together, findings suggest vinexin β modulates ns5a phosphorylation via 
its interaction ns5a, thereby regulating hcv replication, implicating
vinexin β viral life cycle.importance: hepatitis c virus (hcv)
nonstructural protein ns5a phosphoprotein, phosphorylation states
are usually modulated host kinases viral nonstructural elements.
additionally, cellular factors containing src homology 3 (sh3) domains 
reported interact proline-rich regions ns5a. however, unclear
whether relationships ns5a phosphorylation ns5a-sh3
interaction, little known significance interaction in
the hcv life cycle. work, demonstrate vinexin β modulates ns5a
hyperphosphorylation ns5a-vinexin β interaction. hyperphosphorylated 
ns5a induced vinexin β casein kinase 1α dependent also crucial for
hcv propagation. overall, findings elucidate relationships
between ns5a phosphorylation ns5a-sh3 interaction also shed new
mechanistic insight flaviviridae ns5a (ns5) phosphorylation. believe that
our results may afford potential offer antiviral therapeutic strategy.
