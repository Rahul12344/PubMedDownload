the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) mediates toxicologic carcinogenic
properties 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. cytoplasm, ahr is
complexed dimer hsp90, hepatitis b virus x-associated protein 2
(xap2). studies examined ability xap2 modulate ahr
have characterized mouse receptor (mahr). however, amino acid sequence of
mahr significantly different human ahr (hahr) carboxy terminal
half protein, could lead differences behavior the
two receptors. mahr-yellow fluorescent protein (yfp) hahr-yfp used to
compare nucleocytoplasmic shuttling properties ability xap2 to
modulate activity. reported previously, mahr localized predominantly 
the nucleus redistributed cytoplasm coexpression xap2 in
cos-1 cells. leptomycin b treatment revealed xap2 blocked mahr-yfp
translocation nucleus absence ligand. contrast, hahr-yfp
localized predominantly cytoplasm, coexpression xap2 affect
this localization, block nuclear accumulation presence of
leptomycin b. xap2 fusion protein nuclear localization signal fused 
the carboxy terminus (xap2-nls) utilized test whether protein could
drag ahr nucleus. coexpression mahr-yfp xap2-nls caused
cytoplasmic localization mahr, hahr-yfp partially localized in
the nucleus, suggesting xap2 remains bound hahr during
nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. presence xap2 ligand-bound hahr
complex enhanced rate nuclear translocation repressed transcriptional 
activity. together, results suggest hahr differs biochemically
from mahr.
