respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) major pathogen responsible acute
bronchiolitis infancy. however, evaluation relative importance of
rhinovirus multiple viral infections hampered lack of
sensitive diagnostic methodologies. therefore, study used reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction 11 respiratory pathogens assess
the etiology infants acute bronchiolitis correlate clinical
characteristics disease. viruses detected 73.7% patients. rsv
was identified 72.4% virologically confirmed cases, rhinovirus 29%,
whereas multiple infections represented 19.5% cases, (69%) 
combinations rhinovirus rsv. logistic regression model controlling
for age, sex, birth weight, presence fever, day disease admission,
the presence rhinovirus found increase approximately five-fold, 
risk severe disease. multiple pathogens similar trend univariate
analysis, eliminated multivariate model. multiple virus cases
were admitted hospital later course disease unique
pathogen cases, suggesting successive infections. conclusion, rhinovirus is
second rsv causative agent bronchiolitis associated with
more severe disease. presence one pathogen may influence the
natural history acute bronchiolitis.
