cancer virotherapy mediated oncolytic viruses (ov), emerged novel and
effective strategy cancer therapeutics. preclinical models demonstrated
anticancer activity numerous types cancer. currently, number of
recombinant viruses late phase clinical trials, many have
demonstrated promising results regarding safety reliability the
treatments, particularly combined standard antineoplastic therapies. in
addition molecular-targeted therapeutics, genetic engineering viruses
allows functional complementation chemotherapy radiotherapy agents.
co-administration chemotherapy radiotherapy imperative effective 
treatment regime. additionally, approaches may used combination 
current treatments assist cancer management. near future may reveal
whether renewed interest oncological virotherapy result in
meaningful therapeutic effects patients. aim present review 
highlight knowledge oncolytic viral specificity cytotoxicity has
advanced recent years, view discuss ov clinical application and
the future directions field.
