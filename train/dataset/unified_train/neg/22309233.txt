recently, microrna (mirna)-mediated rna interference developed a
useful tool gene function analysis gene therapy. major obstacle in
mirna-mediated rnai cellular delivery, requires efficient and
flexible delivery system. self-assembly ms2 bacteriophage capsids 
been used develop virus-like particles (vlps) rna drug delivery.
however, ms2 vlp-mediated mirna delivery yet reported. therefore 
used escherichia coli expression system produce pre-mir 146a contained 
ms2 vlps, conjugated particles hiv-1 tat(47-57) peptide. 
conjugated ms2 vlps effectively transferred packaged pre-mir146a rna into
various cells tissues, 0.92-14.76-fold higher expression mir-146a 
vitro two-fold higher expression vivo, subsequently suppressed
its targeting gene. findings suggest ms2 vlps used novel
vehicle mirna delivery systems, may applications gene therapy.
