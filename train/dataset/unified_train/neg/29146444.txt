tolls toll-like receptors (tlrs) important regulators innate
immune system genetic variations usually affect host's
susceptibility/resistance pathogen infections. study, report the
single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) toll1 litopenaeus vannamei (lvtoll1)
and associated immune response. pcr-dgge analysis revealed
genetic polymorphisms lvtoll1 genomic dna (gdna) cdna levels. 
using high-throughput sequencing, 223 snps identified gdna level, 
which 145 non-synonymous snp (nssnp), 3 nssnps frequency over
1%. hand, 60 snps identified cdna level including 38
nssnps 4 nssnps frequency 1%. upon challenging shrimps with
streptococcus iniae, vibrio parahaemolyticus white spot syndrome virus
(wssv), lvtoll1 shown generate 6, 4 4 novel bands, respectively when
analyzed pcr-dgge. sequencing analysis bands showed they
contained 6, 4 2 nssnps, respectively. moreover, nssnp c1526t was
detected s. iniae-resistant susceptible shrimps. most
significantly, c1526t mutation could shorten α-helix lrr domain
and predicted affect function lvtoll1, indicating snp c1526t
might associated shrimp's resistance pathogen infections. sum, 
findings reveal genetic polymorphisms toll receptor linked
with immune response pathogen infections l. vannamei.
