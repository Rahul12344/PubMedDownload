the rev protein human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) facilitates nuclear
export intron containing viral mrnas allowing formation infectious virions.
rev traffics nucleolus shuttles nucleus and
cytoplasm. rev multimerization interaction export protein crm1 takes
place nucleolus. test importance rev nucleolar trafficking in
the hiv-1 replication cycle, created nucleolar localizing rev response
element (rre) decoy tested anti-hiv activity. rre decoy
provided marked inhibition hiv-1 replication cem t-cell line and
in primary cd34+ derived monocytes. results demonstrate titration of
rev nucleolus impairs hiv-1 replication supports functional role for
rev trafficking sub-cellular compartment.
