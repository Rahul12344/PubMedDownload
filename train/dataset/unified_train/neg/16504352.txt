bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv) etiological component the
bovine respiratory tract disease complex. infection brsv following
vaccination, re-infection following natural infection common since
protection incomplete. objectives study create plasmid dna
constructs encoding single multiple n-glycosylation-site deletion brsv fusion 
(f) proteins, evaluate expression cell culture, potential to
induce anti-brsv f antibody responses balb/c mice. four plasmid dnas were
constructed, encoding 1-4 n-glycosylation-site deletions: gly4, gly2/4,
gly1/2/4 gly1/2/3/4. n-glycosylation-site deletion brsv f
proteins expressed cos-7 cells following transfection plasmid dna.
inoculation balb/c mice plasmid dna, resulted significant anti-brsv 
f igg response wild-type (wt) f glycosylation-site deletion protein
gly2/4. gly2/4 elicited higher antibody titer fully glycosylated wt f 
protein. significant neutralizing antibody titers detected following
immunization gly2/4 plasmid dna. glycosylation-site deletion brsv 
f proteins useful characterize effects glycosylation on
immunogenicity natural host, may lead new approach the
generation brsv vaccines.
