background: km-023 new second-generation nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase
inhibitor development treatment human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv) type 1 infection.
objective: study determined km-023 tolerability pharmacokinetic
characteristics healthy subjects.
materials methods: randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
dose-escalation study conducted 80 healthy south korean male volunteers.
the subjects allocated single- multiple-dose (once daily 7 days)
groups received 75, 150, 300, 600 mg drug placebo 4:1 ratio.
safety pharmacokinetic assessments performed study. plasma
and urine concentrations quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry.
results: average maximum concentration (cmax) area the
concentration-time curve time 0 infinity (auc∞) values km-023 
75-600 mg doses single-dose study ranged 440.2 ng/ml 1,245.4 ng/ml
and 11,142.4 ng · h/ml 33,705.6 ng · h/ml, respectively. values mean
cmax steady state auc within dosing interval ranged 385.1 ng/ml
to 1,096.7 ng/ml 3,698.9 ng · h/ml 10,232.6 ng · h/ml, respectively,
following 75-600 mg doses multiple-dose study. dose proportionality was
not observed km-023. km-023 showed 0.6-fold accumulation multiple
doses 600 mg dose group. mean half-life values ranged 20.7 and
31.2 hours. km-023 generally well tolerated without serious adverse events.
conclusion: km-023 demonstrated dose- time-dependent nonlinear
pharmacokinetic characteristics single multiple doses dose range 
(75-600 mg) healthy subjects. km-023 showed favorable tolerability this
study. phase clinical trial information used design further
clinical studies appropriately evaluate km-023 patients hiv-1
infection.
