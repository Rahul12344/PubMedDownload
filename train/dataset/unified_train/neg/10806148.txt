respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) bronchiolitis associated subsequent
recurrent wheezing episodes. determine whether cytokine responses during
infection predictive value development recurrent wheezing,
we performed follow-up study 50 hospitalized children rsv
bronchiolitis. monocyte lymphocyte cytokine responses vitro studied
during acute phase disease, convalescent phase, 3 
4 wk later. monocyte cytokine responses, including interleukin-10 (il-10), were
measured whole blood cultures, stimulated lipopolysaccharide and
interferon-gamma (lps + ifn-gamma). addition, t-cell cytokine responses,
including ifn-gamma il-4 production, measured whole-blood cultures
stimulated phytohemagglutinin (pha) alphacd2 + alphacd28. cytokine
responses analyzed relation development recurrent episodes of
wheezing, documented parents diary 1-yr follow-up period. il-10 
responses acute phase rsv bronchiolitis comparable in
healthy control subjects. convalescent phase, il-10 responses were
significantly increased patients compared healthy control
subjects (p < 0.001). follow-up, 27 children (58%) recurrent episodes of
wheezing. il-10 levels, measured convalescent phase, were
significantly higher patients developed recurrent wheezing year
after rsv bronchiolitis patients without recurrent episodes wheezing
(p = 0.006). moreover, il-10 responses convalescent phase correlated
significantly number wheezing episodes (r = 0.42, n = 46, p = 0.004).
interestingly, association found ifn-gamma responses, il-4
responses, ifngamma/il-4 ratios recurrent wheezing. conclude that
monocyte il-10 responses vitro upon stimulation nonspecific stimuli may
have predictive value development recurrent wheezing rsv
bronchiolitis. moreover, results indicate allergen-driven th2
cytokine responses lead asthmatic symptoms also virus-induced changes 
in cytokine responses may result asthmatic symptoms.
