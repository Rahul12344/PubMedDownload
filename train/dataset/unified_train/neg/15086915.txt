background: molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis progression 
clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccrcc) well understood. aimed to
identify new molecular markers provide insight processes.
methods: work reports identification human hepatitis virus
cellular receptor 1 (hhavcr-1) differentially expressed gene ccrcc using 
rna-based arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (rap-pcr). results were
further confirmed northern western blot assays. carcinoma 769-p normal
hk-2 cells derived proximal tubule epithelial cells, grown different
culture conditions, used understand putative role hhavcr-1 in
renal malignancy. hhavcr-1 stable transfected clones dipeptidyl peptidase iv 
(dppiv) assays allowed assessing involvement cell differentiation.
results: hhavcr-1 overexpressed eight 13 ccrcc its
expression neglected benign oncocytomas. culture, hhavcr-1 dramatically 
overexpressed normal tumor cell lines that, acquired fully
differentiated phenotype, induced de-differentiate means phorbol
ester phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (pma) treatment. similarly, differentiation
prevention addition pma confluent cells also increases hhavcr-1
expression. hhavcr-1 stable transfected 769-p cells proved hhavcr-1 itself
blocks differentiation. since hhavcr-1 expressed higher levels tumor
cells, used african green monkey cell model show immunotoxins
directed monkey homologue hhavcr-1 could kill kidney cells.
conclusion: results showed hhavcr-1 blocks differentiation proximal
tubule epithelial cells could used target therapy of
kidney carcinomas.
