a new passive hemagglutination assay detection antibodies rubella
virus hemagglutinin (phast-rubella) compared hemagglutination
inhibition (hi) test another passive hemagglutination test uses a
soluble rubella virus antigen (sa-pha). immune responses vaccinated
individuals monitored, similar rises antibody titer detected hi
or phast-rubella, whereas rise titer detected sa-pha delayed.
early-phase vaccine-induced immunoglobulin antibody analyzed sucrose
gradient fractionation detected degree hi phast-rubella,
but early-phase immunoglobulin g antibody reacted strongly hi test.
when acute convalescent serum pairs rubella-infected individuals were
evaluated, fourfold rise titer detected phast-rubella hi 15 of
15 pairs, whereas sa-pha, intended detecting antibody titer
rises acute infections, detected rise titer 3 15 pairs. in
studies determine rubella immune status, testing 1,078 premarital and
random serum specimens resulted 98.6% agreement among three methods in
identifying rubella antibody-positive -negative individuals. the
quantitative phast-rubella procedure, coefficient correlation 0.93 was
obtained, comparison hi, panel 40 characterized sera were
tested. results indicate phast-rubella reagents detect rubella
antibodies well hi reagents thus may used fast accurate
means determining rubella immune status quantitation rubella
antibodies.
