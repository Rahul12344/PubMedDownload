despite effectiveness selective estrogen receptor (er) modulators in
preventing er-positive breast cancer, chemopreventive agents still need be
developed prevention er-negative breast cancers. naturally
occurring retinoids promising agents prevention human cancers 
are toxic long-term chronic use. previously demonstrated the
chemopreventive effects retinoids could separated toxicity 
using rxr-selective retinoid, lgd1069. studies described demonstrate 
that lgd1069 effectively suppresses er-negative tumor development mouse
mammary tumor virus-erbb2 transgenic mice minimal toxicity. studies
suggest receptor-selective retinoids promising agents prevention
of breast cancer may particularly useful preventing
er-negative breast cancer.
