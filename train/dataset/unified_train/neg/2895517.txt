we determined prevalence antibody cytomegalovirus (cmv) sera 
non-homosexual hemophilia patients homosexual men infected human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). cmv antibody testing latex
agglutination revealed 33 58 hiv-1 infected hemophiliacs (57%) were
antibody-positive compared 54 54 hiv-1 infected asymptomatic
non-hemophiliac homosexuals (100%) (p less .001). nine 15 hemophiliacs
(60%) symptomatic hiv-1 infection cmv antibody-positive. also tested
22 hiv-1 antibody-negative hemophiliacs received non-heat treated factor 
concentrates. 14 22 (64%) cmv antibody-positive compared 57%
of hiv-1 antibody-positive hemophiliacs. conclude 1) little
correlation transmission hiv-1 cmv factor concentrates, 2) 
presence cmv antibody appear associated clinical stage 
hiv-1 infection hemophiliacs, 3) may significant number cmv 
antibody-negative hemophiliacs hiv-1 infection risk primary infection
and subsequent disease cmv seronegative blood products provided for
future transfusions.
