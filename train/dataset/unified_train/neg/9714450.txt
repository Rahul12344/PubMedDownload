the nef protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) abundantly
expressed hiv-1-infected astrocytes shares amino acid sequence homology to
alpha-scorpion toxins bind potassium channels. report effects of
recombinant nef alpha-scorpion toxins membrane potassium transport in
human u251 astroglioma cells. 86rb+ utilized tracer potassium
movements potassium channel activity studied single-channel
patch-clamp techniques. results showed inactivation large-conductance
potassium channel nef added inner leaflet cell membrane of
inside-out patches u251 cells. extracellular addition nef alpha-scorpion
toxins intact glial cells alter potassium transport.
