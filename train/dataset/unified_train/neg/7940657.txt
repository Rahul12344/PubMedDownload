background: confidential unit exclusion (cue) option intended reduce
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) transmission excluding donors newly
infected hiv yet developed hiv antibody (window-period donors);
however, efficacy excluding window-period donors evaluated.
study design methods: use cue option studied among donors 
of 3.7 million units 18 american red cross blood services regions 1991 
and 1992 among 322 previously hiv-1-seronegative donors subsequently
donated seropositive unit 1987 1990 40 united states blood
centers. seroconverting donors previously shown highly
likely donate window period.
results: basis data two populations, estimated that
only 3 5 percent units donated window-period donors transfused 
because cue option, 0.4 percent donations donors who
confidentially excluded blood transfusion, donors who
confidentially excluded blood 21 times likely hiv
antibody-positive donors use cue option. estimated
that, us blood centers used cue option, total 2 17 otherwise
acceptable units donated window-period donors would transfused
annually.
conclusion: although donors confidentially exclude blood from
transfusion 21 times likely hiv antibody, rarity of
window-period donors infrequency confidential exclusion by
window-period donors cause cue option minimal impact transfusion
safety.
