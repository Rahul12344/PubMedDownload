when exotic animal species invade new environments also bring often
unknown microbial diversity, including pathogens. describe novel widely 
distributed virus one globally widespread, abundant damaging
invasive ants (argentine ants, linepithema humile). linepithema humile virus 
1 dicistrovirus, viral family including species known cause widespread 
arthropod disease. detected samples argentina, australia new
zealand. argentine ants new zealand also infected strain of
deformed wing virus common local hymenopteran species, major
pathogen widely associated honeybee mortality. evidence active
replication viral rna apparent viruses. results suggest
co-introduction exchange pathogens within local hymenopteran communities. 
these viral species may contribute collapse argentine ant populations
and offer new options control globally widespread invader.
