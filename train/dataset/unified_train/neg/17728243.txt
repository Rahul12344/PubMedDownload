rare monoclonal antibodies (abs) form irreversible complexes antigens by
enzyme-like covalent nucleophile-electrophile pairing. determine the
feasibility applying irreversible antigen inactivation abs basis 
vaccination microbes, studied polyclonal nucleophilic ab response 
induced electrophilic analog synthetic peptide corresponding the
principal neutralizing determinant (pnd) human immunodeficiency virus type-1
(hiv) gp120 located v3 domain. abs mice immunized pnd analog
containing electrophilic phosphonates (e-pnd) neutralized homologous hiv strain
(mn) approximately 50-fold potently control abs mice immunized
with pnd. igg fractions displayed binding intact hiv particles. hiv
complexes formed anti-e-pnd igg dissociated noticeably slowly the
complexes formed anti-pnd igg. slower dissociation kinetics predicted 
to maintain long-lasting blockade host cell receptor recognition gp120.
pretreatment anti-pnd igg haptenic electrophilic phosphonate
compound resulted rapid dissociation hiv-igg complexes, consistent
with hypothesis enhanced ab nucleophilic reactivity induced by
electrophilic immunization imparts irreversible character complexes. these
results suggest electrophilic immunization induces sufficiently robust
nucleophilic ab response enhance anti-microbial efficacy candidate
polypeptide vaccines.
