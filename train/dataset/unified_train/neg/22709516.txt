human parainfluenza viruses (hpivs) common cause acute respiratory
illness throughout life. infants, children, immunocompromised the
most likely develop severe disease. hpiv1 hpiv2 best known cause
croup hpiv3 common cause bronchiolitis pneumonia. hpivs
replicate productively respiratory epithelial cells spread
systemically unless host severely immunocompromised. molecular studies
have delineated hpivs evade block cellular innate immune responses to
permit efficient replication, local spread, host-to-host transmission.
studies using ex vivo human airway epithelium focused virus tropism,
cellular pathology epithelial inflammatory response, elucidating how
events early infection shape adaptive immune response disease outcome.
