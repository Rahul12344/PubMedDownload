schmallenberg virus (sbv) transmitted insect vectors, therefore
vaccination one important tools disease control. study, 
novel subunit vaccines basis amino-terminal domain sbv gc 234 
amino acids ("gc amino") first tested selected using lethal small
animal challenge model best performing formulations also tested
in cattle. could show neither e. coli expressed reduced form of
"gc amino" protected sbv infection. contrast, both, immunization "gc
amino"-encoding dna plasmids "gc-amino" expressed mammalian system,
conferred protection 66% animals. interestingly, best
performance achieved multivalent antigen containing covalently
linked gc domains both, sbv related akabane virus. vaccinated
cattle mice fully protected sbv challenge infection.
furthermore, absence antibodies viral n-protein,
differentiation vaccinated field-infected animals allows sbv
marker vaccination concept. moreover, presented vaccine design also could 
tested members simbu serogroup might allow inclusion 
additional immunogenic domains.
