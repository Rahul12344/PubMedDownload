eosinophils best known predominant cellular infiltrate associated with
asthma parasitic infections. recently, numerous studies documented the
presence toll-like receptors (tlrs) surfaces eosinophils, suggesting
that leukocytes may participate recognition killing viruses
and bacteria. however, significance role innate immune
response bacterial infection largely unknown. report novel role
for eosinophils antibacterial defenders host response. isolated mouse
eosinophils possessed antipseudomonal properties vitro. vivo, interleukin-5
transgenic mice, profound eosinophilia, demonstrated improved
clearance pseudomonas aeruginosa introduced peritoneal cavity. the
findings improved bacterial clearance following adoptive transfer of
eosinophils, impaired bacterial clearance mice congenital
eosinophil deficiency, established effect eosinophil specific. 
data presented also demonstrate eosinophils mediate antibacterial
effect part release cationic secondary granule proteins.
specifically, isolated eosinophil granules antibacterial properties vitro,
and administration eosinophil granule extracts significantly improved
bacterial clearance vivo. data suggest potent yet underappreciated
antibacterial role eosinophils vivo, specifically eosinophil granules.
moreover, data suggest administration eosinophil-derived products
may represent viable adjuvant therapy septic bacteremic patients
