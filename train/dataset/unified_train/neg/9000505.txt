the generation ceramides action acidic and/or neutral
sphingomyelinases implicated many forms apoptosis. investigated
whether exposure ceramides sufficient induce apoptosis human leukemia
cells and, so, characteristics form apoptosis might be.
treatment acute lymphoblastic t-cell line cem-c7h2 short- and
medium-chain ceramide analogs (c2-, c6-, c8-ceramide) resulted apoptosis, 
whereas inactive c2-dihydroceramide effect cell survival. induction
of apoptosis relatively slow (approximately 40% 24 h) required high
concentrations ceramide analogs (40-100 microm). investigate possible
involvement interleukin 1-beta-converting enzyme (ice) ice-related
proteases, treated cem-c7h2 sublines constitutively expressing vaccinia
virus protease inhibitor crma ceramide analogs. although cells were
completely resistant apoptosis induced antibodies apo-1/fas surface 
receptor (a form apoptosis known inhibitable crma), not
protected ceramide-induced cell death. contrast, tetracycline-regulated
overexpression bcl-2 protected cem-c7h2 sublines stably transfected with
corresponding constructs ceramide-induced apoptosis. thus, human
leukemia cells, ceramides induce relatively slow death response be
prevented bcl-2, independent crma-inhibitable proteases. these
characteristics distinguish ceramide-induced forms apoptosis, 
as apo-1/fas-induced cell death ceramide production causally
implicated.
