key challenges facing cancer therapy development tumor-specific drugs 
and potent multimodal regimens. oncolytic adenoviruses possess potential to
realize aims restricting virus replication tumors inserting
therapeutic genes virus genome, respectively. major effort this
regard express transgenes tumor-specific manner without affecting
virus replication. using luciferase sensitive reporter genetic
prodrug activation, show promoter control e1a facilitates highly
selective expression transgenes inserted late transcription unit.
this, however, required multistep optimization late transgene expression.
transgene insertion via internal ribosome entry site (ires), splice acceptor
(sa), viral 2a sequences resulted replication-dependent expression.
unexpectedly, analyses appropriate substrates matching control
viruses revealed ires sa, 2a, facilitated indirect transgene
targeting via tyrosinase promoter control e1a. transgene expression via sa was
more selective (up 1,500-fold) less effective via ires. notably, we
also revealed transgene-dependent interference splicing. hence, prodrug 
convertase fcu1 (a cytosine deaminase-uracil phosphoribosyltransferase fusion
protein) expressed optimizing sequence surrounding sa site
and mutating cryptic splice site within transgene. resulting tyrosinase
promoter-regulated fcu1-encoding adenovirus combined effective oncolysis with
targeted prodrug activation therapy melanoma. thus, prodrug activation showed 
potent bystander killing increased cytotoxicity virus 10-fold.
we conclude armed oncolytic viruses improved substantially by
comparing optimizing strategies targeted transgene expression, thereby
implementing selective multimodal cancer therapies.
