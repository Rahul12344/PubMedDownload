at present antiviral agents available treatment infection the
pathogenic poxvirus molluscum contagiosum virus (mcv). report the
identification characterization inhibitor active the
virus-encoded type-1 topoisomerase, enzyme likely required mcv
replication. screened library marine extracts natural products from
microorganisms using mcv topoisomerase assays vitro. cyclic depsipeptide
sansalvamide found inhibit topoisomerase-catalyzed dna relaxation.
sansalvamide inactive two dna-modifying enzymes tested a
counterscreen. assays discrete steps topoisomerase reaction cycle
revealed sansalvamide inhibited dna binding thereby covalent complex
formation, resealing dna nick preformed covalent complex.
sansalvamide also inhibits dna binding isolated catalytic domain,
thereby specifying part protein sensitive sansalvamide a. these
data specify mechanism sansalvamide inhibits mcv topoisomerase.
cyclic depsipeptides related sansalvamide represent potentially promising 
chemical family development anti-mcv agents.
