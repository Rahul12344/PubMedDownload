calmodulin (cam) expression upregulated upon hiv-1 infection interacts
with proteins involved viral processing, including multifunctional hiv-1
ma protein. present results studies utilizing small-angle neutron 
scattering contrast variation that, considered light earlier 
fluorescence nmr data, show cam binds extended open-clamp
conformation via interactions two tryptophans widely spaced in
sequence space. interaction requires disruption tertiary fold
such becomes highly extended long snakelike conformation. cam-ma
interface extensive, covering ~70% length regions
known important interactions critical binding partners would 
impacted. cam conformation semiextended distinct the
classical cam-collapse short α-helical targets. nmr data show upon
dissociation cam-ma complex, either removal ca(2+) increasing
ionic strength, reforms native tertiary contacts. thus, observe high 
level structural plasticity may facilitate regulation its
activities via intracellular ca(2+)-signaling viral processing.
