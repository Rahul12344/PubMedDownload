bacteriophage φ6 contains three double-stranded rna (dsrna) genomic segments, l, 
m, s. rna located inside core particle composed multiple copies
of major structural protein, rna-dependent rna polymerase, hexameric
ntpase, auxiliary protein. virion rna polymerase core particle 
transcribes segments vitro. segment l transcribed poorly because
its transcript starts gu instead gg found segments m.
transcription vivo modified binding host protein yajq the
outside core particle segment l transcribed well. mechanism
is determinant temporal control gene expression φ6. mutants of
φ6 isolated independent yajq transcription segment
l. mutations found gene viral polymerase major
capsid protein both. mutants capable transcribing segment l 
the gu start ga gc. found true yajq added to
wild-type particles. minus-strand synthesis restrictions different
from plus-strand synthesis, yajq mutations independence 
modify minus-strand synthesis behavior. purified polymerase p2 able to
transcribe dsrna, transcription behavior segment l wild-type and
mutant polymerases different seen capsid structures. adding yajq 
to purified polymerase change transcription specificity.
