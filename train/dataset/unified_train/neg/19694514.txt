human disease caused highly pathogenic avian influenza (h5n1) associated
with fulminant viral pneumonia mortality rates excess 60%. cytokine
dysregulation thought contribute pathogenesis. comparison with
human seasonal influenza (h1n1) viruses, clade 1, 2.1, 2.2 h5n1 viruses
induced higher levels tumor necrosis factor-alpha primary human
macrophages. understand viral genetic determinants responsible this
hyperinduction cytokines, constructed recombinant viruses containing
different combinations genes high-cytokine (a/vietnam/1203/04) and
low-cytokine (a/wsn/33) phenotype h1n1 viruses tested cytokine-inducing
phenotype human macrophages. results suggest h5n1 polymerase gene
segments, lesser extent ns gene segment, contribute cytokine
hyperinduction human macrophages putative h5 pandemic virus that
may arise genetic reassortment h5n1 one current
seasonal influenza viruses may markedly altered cytokine phenotype.
