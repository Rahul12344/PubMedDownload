chronic hepatitis c affects 2.2-3.0% world population (130 million-170
million). pegylated interferon-α (peg-ifn-α) combination ribavirin (rbv),
the approved standard therapy, leads viral eradication 50% of
treated patients. 2009, genome-wide association studies (gwas) identified host
genetic variation critical predicting treatment response and
spontaneous clearance patients infected hepatitis c virus (hcv). a
correlated set polymorphisms region interleukin-28b (il-28b)
gene chromosome 19, coding interferon (ifn)-λ3 associated with
clearance genotype 1 hepatitis c virus (hcv) patients treated with
peg-ifn-α rbv. polymorphisms subsequently associated with
spontaneous clearance hcv untreated patients. addition, prediction of
viral response peg-ifn-α rbv therapy patients recurrent hcv
infection orthotopic liver transplantation depends il-28b genotype
of recipient donor tissues. diagnosis patient's il-28b genotype 
likely aid clinical decision making standard-of-care regimens. future 
studies investigate possibility individualizing treatment duration
and novel regimens according il-28b genotype. gwas yield unexpected data,
this approach could lead development novel drug therapy, as
already appears promising ifn-λ. okuda lecture, present the
current understanding regard relationship host variations and
clinical outcome hepatitis c.
