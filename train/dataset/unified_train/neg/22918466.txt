the course immune maturation evolved favour survival stage of
development early life. fetal neonatal immune adaptations facilitate
intrauterine survival provide early postnatal protection against
extracellular pathogens, leave infants susceptible intracellular
pathogens viruses acquired perinatally. review focuses on
three pathogens--hiv, hepatitis b virus cytomegalovirus--and relates the
differential impact infections infants adults antiviral
immunity generated different ages. better understanding of
age-specific antiviral immunity may inform development integrated
prevention, treatment vaccine strategies minimize global disease
