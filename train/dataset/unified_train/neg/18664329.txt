aim: substantiate vitro translational studies cross-kingdom,
internal ribosome entry site (ires), 5 untranslated region the
rhopalosiphum padi virus (rhpv), function mammalian cells act a
shuttle ires insect cells mammalian cells.
methods: cytomegalovirus (cmv) promoter-based bicistronic mammalian cell
expression vectors, either plasmids baculovirus vectors, generated.
plasmid transient transfection baculovirus transduction assays performed
to test whether rhpv ires mediate translation activity versatile
mammalian cell lines.
results: plasmids recombinant baculoviruses containing cmv promoter 
and rhpv ires mediate bicistronic gene expression mammalian cells.
however, cmv promoter containing recombinant baculovirus-infected insect
sf21 cells, second cistron gene expression observed. northern blot
analysis promoterless assay demonstrated rhpv ires exhibited
cryptic promoter activity baculovirus-infected insect cells.
conclusion: rhpv ires mediate gene expression insect cells and
mammalian cells, characteristic rhpv ires facilitate the
development bicistronic baculovirus gene therapy vectors.
