htlv-1 implicated development diverse diseases. however, most
htlv-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic. htlv-1 infection leads to
disparate consequences remains mystery, despite extensive investigation of
htlv-1 isolates infected individuals. human infection, experimental
htlv-1 infection rabbits generally benign, although htlv-1-infected rabbit 
t cell lines mediate lethal leukemia-like disease reported. we
report thymuses mature outbred rabbits inoculated lethal
leukemia-like disease reported. report thymuses from
mature outbred rabbits inoculated lethal htlv-1 cell line (rh/k34)
showed morphological biochemical evidence apoptosis, whereas thymuses from
rabbits inoculated nonlethal htlv-1 cell lines showed signs of
apoptosis. exposure rabbit human lymphocytes purified virus rh/k34 
caused rapid induction apoptosis, providing vitro correlate the
pathogenic effects. contrast, virus isolated nonlethal cell line
mediated dose-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. data implicate lymphocyte
apoptosis potential mechanism lethal htlv-1 cell line causes
fulminant disease provide means identify factors contributing htlv-1 
disease. results htlv-1 infection model provide insight into
variations htlv-1 pathogenicity human infection.
