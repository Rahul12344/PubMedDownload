avian influenza virus reassortants resembling 1918 human pandemic virus can
become transmissible among mammals acquiring mutations hemagglutinin (ha)
and polymerase. using ferret model, trace evolutionary pathway by
which avian-like virus evolves capacity mammalian replication and
airborne transmission. initial infection, within-host ha diversity
increased drastically. then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations
that confer detectable replication advantage. later transmissions,
selection fixed advantageous ha1 variants. transmission initially involved a
"loose" bottleneck, became strongly selective additional ha mutations
emerged. stringency evolutionary forces governing between-host
bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. mutations occurred
in multiple combinations transmitted viruses, suggesting mammalian
transmissibility evolve multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic 
constraints. data provide glimpse avian influenza virus adaptation 
mammals, broad implications surveillance potentially zoonotic
viruses.
