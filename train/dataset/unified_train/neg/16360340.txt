objective: investigate immunopathogenesis pericardial tuberculosis (tb)
and influence human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) anti-tuberculous
immune response.
design: consecutive patients presenting large pericardial effusions were
subjected full clinical examination pericardiocentesis. aspirated fluid 
was sent biochemistry, differential leukocyte count, flow cytometric analysis
and determination cytokine levels. pericardial tissue sent tb culture 
and histopathological evaluation. diagnoses made according pre-determined
criteria.
results: fifty-six patients included divided hiv positive tb (n =
22), hiv negative tb (n = 21) non-tuberculous effusions (n = 13). peripheral 
blood neutrophil, lymphocyte monocyte counts significantly lower hiv 
positive tb patients. lymphocytes dominant cell type tuberculous
pericardial effusions. cd4+ cells dominated hiv negative tuberculous
effusions, whereas cd8+ cells dominated hiv positive tb. difference the
concentration ifn-gamma levels tuberculous non-tuberculous
pericardial effusions statistically significant. despite significant
differences pericardial cd4+ cell counts, ifn-gamma levels similarly
elevated hiv negative hiv positive tuberculous effusions. highest levels
of pericardial il-10 observed samples associated least tissue
necrosis, suggesting possibility tissue protective immunoregulatory role
for il-10.
conclusions: tuberculous pericardial effusions result helper1
(th1)-dominant immune response. ifn-gamma producing cd4+ lymphocytes dominate 
hiv negative patients, whereas cd8+ seem play important role hiv
positive patients. infection hiv leads depletion immunocompetent
cells monocytes, nk cells neutrophils.
