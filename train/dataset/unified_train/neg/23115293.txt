identification host factors needed zaire ebolavirus (ebov) entry 
provides insights mechanism(s) filovirus uptake, factors
may serve potential antiviral targets. order identify novel host genes
and pathways involved ebov entry, gene array findings national cancer
institute's nci-60 panel human tumor cell lines correlated with
permissivity ebov glycoprotein (gp)-mediated entry. found gene
encoding γ2 subunit amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) strongly
correlated ebov transduction tumor panel. ampk inhibitor compound
c inhibited infectious ebov replication vero cells diminished ebov
gp-dependent, lassa fever virus gpc-dependent, entry variety of
cell lines dose-dependent manner. compound c also prevented ebov gp-mediated
infection primary human macrophages, major target filoviral replication
in vivo. consistent role ampk filovirus entry, time-of-addition
studies demonstrated compound c abrogated infection added at
early time points became progressively less effective added later.
compound c prevented ebov pseudovirion internalization 37°c cell-bound
particles remained susceptible trypsin digestion presence the
inhibitor absence. mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking ampkα1 
and ampkα2 catalytic subunits significantly less permissive ebov
gp-mediated infection wild-type counterparts, likely due decreased 
macropinocytic uptake. total, findings implicate ampk macropinocytic 
events needed ebov gp-dependent entry identify novel cellular target
for new filoviral antivirals.
