to identify major antigenic determinant use development rapid
serological diagnostic test severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars)
coronavirus infection study immune response sars coronavirus
infection humans, cloned full length six truncated fragments the
nucleocapsid gene, expressed them, purified glutathione
s-transferase-tagged recombinant proteins. reactivities recombinant
proteins panel antibodies containing 33 sars coronavirus-positive sera
and 66 negative sera antibodies animal coronaviruses were
screened. truncated 195-amino-acid fragment c terminus the
nucleocapsid protein (n195) identified strong ability detect
antibodies sars coronavirus. cross-reaction found n195
protein antibodies chicken, pig, canine coronaviruses. n195
protein used develop western blot assay detect antibodies against
sars coronavirus 274 clinically blinded samples. specificity and
sensitivity test 98.3 90.9%, respectively. correlation
between western blotting assay immunofluorescence assay (ifa) also
analyzed. results western blot assay ifa detection sars
coronavirus-positive sera same. thus, n195 protein identified as
a suitable protein used antigen western blot possible
assays detection sars coronavirus infection.
