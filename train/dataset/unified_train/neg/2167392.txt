environmental contaminants contain chemicals that, ingested, could affect 
immunological status wild birds, particular, resistance to
infectious disease. immunosuppression caused environmental contaminants, could
have major impact waterfowl populations, resulting increased
susceptibility contagious disease agents. duck plague virus caused
repeated outbreaks waterfowl resulting mortality. study, several
doses cyclophosphamide (cy), known immunosuppressant, administered to
adult mallards (anas platyrhynchos) determine resultant decrease in
resistance normally sub-lethal strain duck plague virus would occur, 
induce mortality birds. death occurred birds given cy only, in
birds given virus cy, given virus only. was
significantly greater mortality rapid deaths duck plague
virus-infected groups groups receiving immunosuppressant. a
positively correlated dose-response effect observed cy mortalities,
irrespective virus exposure. fuel oil crude oil, common environmental 
contaminants immunosuppressive capabilities, tested determine if
they could produce effect similar cy. following 28 days oral oil
administration, birds challenged sub-lethal dose duck plague
virus. alteration resistance virus (as measured mortality) was
observed, except positive cy control group.
