this study reports novel hiv-1 recombinant virus (gx2016eu10) isolated a
24-year-old man, infected homosexual sex guangxi, china. near
full-length genome analyses showed gx2016eu10 kept crf07_bc parental backbone
with three crf01_ae segments inserted gag, pol, vpu, env, nef genes,
respectively. recombinant breakpoints completely different the
other crf01_ae/crf07_bc recombinant forms reported. gx2016eu10 ccr5-tropic
through ghost cell identification. emergence gx2016eu10 indicates the
hiv-1 epidemic among men sex men guangxi increasing in
complexity, poses serious challenge prevention control.
