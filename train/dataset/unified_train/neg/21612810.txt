a crucial step arenavirus life cycle proteolytic processing 
viral envelope glycoprotein precursor (gpc) cellular proprotein convertase
(pc) subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (ski-1)/site-1 protease (s1p). conducted 
a systematic quantitative analysis ski-1/s1p processing peptides
derived recognition sites gpcs different old world new world
arenaviruses. found ski-1/s1p showed strong preference arenaviral
sequences resembling autoprocessing sites, recurrent motifs in
arenaviral gpcs. african arenaviruses lassa, mobala, mopeia resemble 
ski-1/s1p autoprocessing c-site, whereas sequences derived clade b new world
viruses junin tacaribe similarities autoprocessing b-site. in
contrast, analogous peptides derived cellular ski-1/s1p substrates were
remarkably poor substrates. data suggest arenavirus gpcs evolved to
mimic ski-1/s1p autoprocessing sites, likely ensuring efficient cleavage and
perhaps avoiding competition ski-1/s1p's cellular substrates.
