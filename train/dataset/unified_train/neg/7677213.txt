puumala (puu) virus etiologic agent nephropathia epidemica (ne) in
humans. disease highly endemic vasterbotten county, sweden, an
annual incidence 19.2 (range 3.7-37.4) per 100,000 inhabitants. voles are
considered main reservoir vector puu virus. total 
3,591 rodents (mainly clethrionomys glareolus, c. rufocanus, microtus
agrestis) trapped vasterbotten 1979 1987 tested the
presence puu virus antibodies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the
predominant species, c. glareolus (71% [2,544 3,591]), also highest
antibody prevalence (19% [483 2,544]). c. glareolus, antibody
prevalence rate increased weight (age), reaching 50% the
heaviest weight group, suggesting horizontal infection may important.
the highest frequency (25%) antibody-positive c. rufocanus also found in
the highest weight groups. microtus agrestis showed low absolute numbers a
low antibody prevalence rate (5%). c. glareolus, antibody prevalence 
weight recurrently higher spring previous fall. the
antibody prevalence rate spring positively correlated vole
density previous fall spring. fall antibody prevalence rate was
directly dependent c. glareolus density. incidence human ne fall
was dependent concurrent density c. glareolus, whereas incidence of
ne spring dependent vole density previous fall.
