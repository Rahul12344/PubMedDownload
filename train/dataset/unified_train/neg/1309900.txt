an adeno-associated virus (aav) genome lys-to-his (k340h) mutation 
consensus nucleotide triphosphate binding site rep gene a
dominant-negative dna replication phenotype vivo. expressed wild-type 
(rep78) mutant (rep78ntp) proteins two helper-free expression systems
consisting either recombinant baculoviruses insect cells human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat promoter human 293 cell
transient transfections. analyzed nuclear extracts expression
systems ability complement uninfected hela cell cytoplasmic extracts
in vitro terminal resolution assay covalently closed aav
terminal hairpin structure converted extended linear duplex. although
both rep78 rep78ntp bound aav terminal hairpin dna vitro, rep78 not
rep78ntp complemented terminal resolution assay. furthermore, rep78ntp was
trans dominant aav terminal resolution vitro. propose the
dominant-negative replication phenotype aav genomes carrying k340h
mutation mediated mutant rep proteins binding terminal repeat
hairpin.
