t lymphocytes play important roles infectious diseases and
autoimmunity, also immune responses tumors. many these
disorders, relevant target antigens known. designing effective
methods allow search t-cell epitopes therefore important goal 
in areas infectious diseases, oncology, vaccine development, numerous 
other biomedical specialties. far, strategies used examine t-cell
recognition based largely mapping t-cell epitopes overlapping
peptides known proteins entire proteins, e.g., specific
virus, bacterium, human tissue. approaches tedious number
of limitations. is, example, almost impossible isolate cells that
infiltrate organ infectious site identify specificity unless one 
already concept antigens may relevant. recent years, 
a number laboratories developed less biased approaches employ either
the selection putative t-cell epitopes based prediction binding to
certain major histocompatibilty complex (mhc) molecules peptide protein
libraries generated expression systems, e.g. phage, rely 
combinatorial peptide chemistry. latter technique refined a
number laboratories including ours. bead-bound or, preferably, positional
scanning synthetic soluble combinatorial peptide libraries allow the
identification t-cell epitopes within complex mixtures proteins even 
cells expanded organ infiltrate polyclonal
stimulus. practical steps involved latter method are
described article.
