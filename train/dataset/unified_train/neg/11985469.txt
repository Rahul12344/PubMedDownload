utilizing tools parallel synthesis structure-based design, new class
of michael acceptor-containing, irreversible inhibitors human rhinovirus 3c
protease (hrv 3cp) discovered. inhibitors shown inhibit hrv-14
3cp rates inactivation ranging 886 31 400 m(-1) sec(-1). these
inhibitors exhibit antiviral activity tested hrv-14 infected h1-hela
cells, ec(50) values ranging 1.94 0.15 microm. cytotoxicity was
observed limits assay concentration. crystal structure one 
the potent inhibitors covalently bound hrv-2 3cp detailed. these
compounds also tested hrv serotypes type 14 were
found highly variable activities.
