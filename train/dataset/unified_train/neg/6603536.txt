titration antibody adult t-cell leukemia (atl)-virus-associated antigen
(atla) much help diagnosing atl, almost patients atl
are seropositive even atl-nonendemic area kyoto. t-cell
lymphoma, anti-atla antibody thought related birthplace the
patients epidermotropism skin lesions, not
confirmative number cases small. present two
curious cases anti-atla-negative t-cell leukemia/lymphoma. 53-yr-old man,
born nonendemic area, manifestations similar atl except 
the lack skin involvement, morphology leukemic cells less
like atl cells prolymphocytic leukemia cells. therefore, his
leukemia diagnosed atl. 52-yr-old woman, whose parents' hometown was
in endemic area, showed typical manifestations nonleukemic t-cell lymphoma,
and biopsied lymph node compatible diffuse, pleomorphic lymphoma
histologically. latter patient, negative anti-atla finding might be
due titration sensitivity. therefore, clinical hematologic features
are still informative distinguishing atl t-cell malignancies.
