the clinical picture viral encephalitis determined affinity and
persistence virus different brain regions. therefore, present study
was aimed investigate neuropathological changes following japanese
encephalitis virus (jev) infection rat different time points. twelve days
old wistar rats infected intracerebral inoculation jev. presence of
jev antigen detected thalamus, striatum, cortex mid brain 3, 6, 10 
and 20 days post inoculation (d.p.i.). histopathological changes also
studied different brain regions different time points. highest
expression jev antigen found 6 dpi brain regions studied.
jev antigen maximum thalamus 6 d.p.i. mid brain 10 d.p.i. jev
antigen, however, almost undetectable 20 d.p.i. regions. the
classical pathological changes cellular infiltration, perivascular
cuffing, meningeal disruption, neuronal damage, neuronal shrinkage, plaque
formation observed 10 d.p.i. present study reveals high affinity
of jev thalamus, brainstem striatum. rat model jev infection may serve 
as useful model studying mechanism cell injury recovery je.
