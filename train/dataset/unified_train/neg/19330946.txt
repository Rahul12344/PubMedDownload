early results recognized influenza virus infects innate and
adaptive immune cells. data presented paper demonstrated that
influenza virus labeled fluorescent dye retained ability to
infect replicate host cells, also stimulated similar human immune
response unlabeled virus. influenza virus largely infected innate 
activated adaptive immune cells. influenza b type virus different that
of type virus. b type virus able infect immature lymphocytes, in
lower amounts compared activated lymphocytes. protection influenza
is tightly associated cellular immunity. traditional methods cellular
immunity assay limitations imitate natural human cell-mediated
responses influenza virus. labeled viruses could used assay of
virus-specific cytotoxicity, might reflect natural process more
closely. furthermore, human immune cells activated one influenza subtype virus
could kill cells infected subtype virus. results implied the
human immune cells could directly handle remove free virus using similar
mechanism used remove virus-infected nonimmune cells, might
help simplify design production influenza vaccine, thereby reduce
the cost.
