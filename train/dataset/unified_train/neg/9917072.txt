the coat protein bacteriophage ms2 known bind specifically rna
hairpin formed within ms2 genome. structurally hairpin built an
rna double helix interrupted one unpaired nucleotide closed a
four-nucleotide loop. performed crystallographic studies complexes
between ms2 coat protein capsids four rna hairpin variants order to
evaluate minimal requirements tight binding coat protein to
obtain information three-dimensional structure hairpins. 
an rna fragment including four loop nucleotides two-base-pair stem 
without unpaired nucleotide sufficient binding coat protein
shell conditions used study. contrast, rna fragment
containing stem unpaired nucleotide missing loop nucleotides
does bind protein shell.
