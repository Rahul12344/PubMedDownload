aim: although ebola virus infection (evi) clinically presents common,
prominent, gastroenterologic manifestations, subject previously
reviewed. work critically comprehensively reviews subject.
methods: study comprehensive literature review generated by
computerized search literature, supplemented review monographs and
textbooks pathology, gastroenterology, infectious diseases, virology.
results: common gastrointestinal manifestations include diarrhea-70 %, nausea and
vomiting-60 %, abdominal pain-45 %. diarrhea nausea vomiting
frequently produce profound, life-threatening hypovolemia requiring intravenous
administration crystalloid solutions, frequently produce electrolyte
disorders requiring electrolyte supplementation. although gastrointestinal
hemorrhage commonly reported early epidemics, frequency decreased 
to 10 % prevention disseminated intravascular coagulation.
hyperamylasemia commonly reported, frequency pancreatitis is
unknown. mean serum ast alt levels 200/ul, unusual
pattern viral hepatitis ast > alt. serum alkaline phosphatase averages
about 160 iu/l, whereas total bilirubin averages 0.8 mg/dl. risks of
contracting infection endoscopy performed infected patients are
unknown, may significant, indicated hundreds healthcare workers
contracting evi epidemics instituting strict infectious control
measures anecdotal evidence one endoscopist contracting evi from
performing endoscopy infected patient.
conclusions: physicians must vigilant gastroenterologic manifestations 
evi appropriate diagnosis therapy. work stimulate
clinicopathologic studies improve current understanding the
gastroenterologic pathophysiology. endoscopy currently standardly
recommended evaluate diarrhea, nausea vomiting, abdominal pain
associated evi due potential risks, may considered endoscopic 
therapy active, life-threatening, gi hemorrhage.
