infection cells picornaviruses rhinovirus, aphthovirus, and
enterovirus groups results shutoff host protein synthesis allows
viral protein synthesis proceed. although considerable evidence suggests 
this shutoff mediated cleavage eukaryotic translation initiation
factor eif4g sequence-specific viral proteases (2a protease case of
coxsackievirus), several experimental observations variance this
view. thus, cleavage cellular proteins could contribute the
shutoff host protein synthesis stimulation viral protein synthesis.
recent evidence indicates highly conserved 70-kda cytoplasmic
poly(a)-binding protein (pabp) participates directly translation initiation.
we found pabp also proteolytically cleaved coxsackievirus
infection hela cells. cleavage pabp correlated better time with
the host translational shutoff onset viral protein synthesis

xenopus pabp demonstrate cleavage catalyzed 2a protease directly. 
n- c-terminal sequencing indicates cleavage occurs uniquely human
