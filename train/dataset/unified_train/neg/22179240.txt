elevated winter losses managed honeybee colonies major concern, 
underlying mechanisms remain controversial. among suspects parasitic 
mite varroa destructor, microsporidian nosema ceranae, associated
viruses. hypothesize pathogens reduce life expectancy winter 
bees, thereby constituting proximate mechanism colony losses. monitoring 
of colonies performed 6 months switzerland summer 2007 winter
2007/2008. individual dead workers collected daily quantitatively
analyzed deformed wing virus (dwv), acute bee paralysis virus (abpv), n.
ceranae, expression levels vitellogenin gene biomarker for
honeybee longevity. workers colonies failed survive winter a
reduced life span beginning late fall, likely infected with
dwv, higher dwv loads. colony levels infection parasitic mite
varroa destructor individual infections dwv also associated with
reduced honeybee life expectancy. sharp contrast, level n. ceranae
infection correlated longevity. addition, vitellogenin gene
expression significantly positively correlated abpv n. ceranae
loads. findings strongly suggest v. destructor dwv (but neither n.
ceranae abpv) reduce life span winter bees, thereby constituting a
parsimonious possible mechanism honeybee colony losses.
