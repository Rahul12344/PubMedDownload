epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) protein overexpression commonly found 
in human gastric cancer, gene amplification known correlate with
poor prognosis gastric cancer patients. regard therapy trials
targeting egfr, reported stable transfection egfr antisense
or treatment antibody egfr results growth suppression human
cancer cells express high levels egfr. designed an
adenovirus-expressing antisense egfr investigated effect the
growth gastric cancer vitro vivo. following infection egfr
antisense rna-expressing adenovirus (ad-eas), cell surface egfr protein
levels infected cancer cells markedly reduced, vitro growth of
ad-eas-infected cells significantly inhibited relative control-infected
cells three gastric cancer cell lines (ags, kkls, mkn28) studied 
(p < .0002). nude mouse subcutaneous tumor system, vivo tumor growth of
mkn28 significantly inhibited ad-eas treatment, inhibition day
48 93% volume compared untreated controls. results
suggest adenoviral vector system targeting down-regulation egfr
could good candidate therapy gastric cancers overexpress
egfr.
