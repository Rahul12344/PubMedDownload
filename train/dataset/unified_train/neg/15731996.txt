a significant percentage human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) -infected
individuals also infected hepatitis c virus (hcv). the
much-improved survival hiv-infected patients use highly active 
antiretroviral therapy, liver disease caused coinfection hcv emerged 
as significant threat health survival persons hiv disease.
hiv/hcv-coinfected patients ongoing hiv viremia faster rate of
hcv-related liver fibrosis progression rapid progression liver
failure hepatocellular carcinoma hcv-monoinfected persons. contrast to
the deleterious effect hiv hcv-related liver disease, studies have
shown hcv influence progression hiv infection aids death. 
hcv therapy peginterferon alfa (2a 2b) plus ribavirin achieve a
sustained viral response hiv/hcv-coinfected patients 38% hcv
genotype 1 73% genotypes 2 3. safety profile largely
similar therapy hiv-monoinfected patients, higher incidence 
of mitochondrial toxicity patients taking didanosine stavudine of
anemia patients taking zidovudine. proven anti-hcv therapy for
hiv/hcv-coinfected patients end-stage liver disease (esld). liver
transplantation investigated potential therapeutic option for
hiv-infected individuals esld, initial reports encouraging. given
that pegylated interferon ribavirin shown safe effective 
for hiv/hcv coinfection well hcv monoinfection, hiv/hcv-coinfected
patients evaluated therapy.
