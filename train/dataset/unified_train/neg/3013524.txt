papillomaviruses form one genus papovaviridae family. share common
antigenic determinants dnas cross-hybridize conditions low
stringency. classification papillomaviruses present based the
host range relatedness nucleic acids. isolates considered
independent types less 50% cross-hybridization liquid
phase according standard protocol. least 31 human six bovine
papillomavirus types differentiated basis. host range not
reflect natural relationship viruses. subgenera, differ 
biological properties, distinguished outline. data overall sequence 
homology insufficient meaningful classification two types of
virus may closely related within one genome region rather heterogeneous in
other areas. new isolates appear intermediates previously
well-separated types complicate system. reasonable classification of
such types papillomavirus based homologies genes are
relevant differences biology viruses. functional mapping of
the rather uniformly organized, colinear genomes papillomaviruses been
started. genetic studies bovine papillomavirus type 1 assigned
functions replication, transformation, gene expression capsid synthesis to
individual open reading frames.
