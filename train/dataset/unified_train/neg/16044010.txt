reaction. associations couples' hiv status key sociodemographic,
behavioral, biomedical factors analyzed.
results: men hiv-concordant couples likely men in
hiv-discordant couples living together sexual partner (odds
ratio [or], 11.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.8-53.7; p=0.004), be
uncircumcised (or, 4.5; 95% ci, 1.1-18.8; p=0.042), higher hiv loads 
(or log increase, 3.0; 95% ci, 2.0-4.7; p<0.001). women in
hiv-concordant couples likely women hiv-discordant couples to
be living together sexual partner (or, 19.0; 95% ci, 3.8-84.8), to
