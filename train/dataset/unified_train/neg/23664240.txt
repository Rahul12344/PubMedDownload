the optimal sterilization method load bearing allografts remains clinical
concern. recently, supercritical carbon dioxide (scco2) treatments been
shown capable terminally sterilizing range bacteria viruses,
while preserving static mechanical properties cortical bone. study
evaluated effect scco2 treatment compared two doses gamma
irradiation, clinically relevant dynamic mechanical properties cortical
bone. quasi-static testing also performed compare impairment of
treatment. whole paired adult rabbit humeri dissected randomly assigned 
into either scco2 control, scco2 additive gamma irradiation 10 25kgy
treatment groups. bones treated mechanically tested three-point
bending, lefts acting controls treated rights. maximum load, 
energy failure stiffness evaluated static tests. number of
cycles failure determined fatigue 6-60% ultimate load. 
study found scco2 treatment without additive alter static or
dynamic mechanical properties. gamma irradiation deleterious dose dependent
effect, statistically significant (p<0.05) reductions static
mechanical parameters 25kgy. effect increased fatigue with
statistically significant decreases 10 25kgy dose groups. this
study highlights expediency scco2 treatment load bearing bone
allograft processing terminal sterilization achieved maintaining 
both quasi-static dynamic mechanical properties graft.
