naturally siv-infected sooty mangabeys (sms) remain asymptomatic despite high
virus replication. elucidating mechanisms underlying aids resistance of
siv-infected sms may provide crucial information better understand aids
pathogenesis. study, assessed determinants set-point viremia in
naturally siv-infected sms, i.e., immune control siv replication versus target
cell limitation. depleted cd4+ cells 6 naturally siv-infected sms by
treating humanized anti-cd4 mab (cdr-okt4a-huigg1). cd4+ cells were
depleted almost completely blood bm variable levels mucosal
tissues lns. marked depletion cd14+ monocytes observed.
importantly, cd4+ cell depletion associated rapid, significant
decline viral load, returned baseline level day 30-45, coincident 
with increased fraction proliferating activated cd4+ cells.
throughout study, virus replication correlated level of
proliferating cd4+ cells. cd4+ cell depletion induce changes in
the fraction tregs level siv-specific cd8+ cells. results
suggest availability activated cd4+ cells, rather immune
control siv replication, main determinant set-point viral load
during natural siv infection sms.
