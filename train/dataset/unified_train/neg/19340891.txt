as part investigation identify potential new viral reduction strategies,
ultraviolet-c (uv-c) light examined. although technology known 
for decades possess excellent virus inactivation capabilities, uv-c light 
also introduce significant unwanted damage proteins. study effect on
monoclonal antibodies, three different antibodies subjected varying
levels uv-c light using novel dosing device bayer technology services
gmbh. range fluencies (or doses) covered 0 300 j/m(2) a
wavelength 254 nm. product quality data generated processed pools
showed minimal damage done antibodies. aggregate formation low
for two three antibodies tested. acidic basic variants increased for
all three antibodies, basic species increasing acidic
species. peptide maps made three sets pools showed damage two of
the three antibody backbones, whereas third antibody low levels of
methionine oxidation evident. samples held 2-8 degrees c 33 days showed no
increase aggregates charge variants, indicating proteins not
degrade damaged reactive catalytic species may
have created exposure uv-c light. overall, uv-c light shown to
induce little damage monoclonal antibodies lower fluencies appears
to viable option viral inactivation biotechnology applications.
