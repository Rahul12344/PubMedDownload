human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients display severe impairments
of gastrointestinal functions, including diarrhea malabsorption, even 
absence opportunistic infections. since hiv-1 proteins nucleic acids 
been detected several cell types intestinal mucosa, been
postulated hiv-1 could alter enterocytic functions. present
study, analyzed effect hiv-1 differentiation process the
epithelial intestinal cell clone ht-29-d4, mimics maturation of
enterocytes along crypt-villus axis small intestine. found that
hiv-1 infection impairs cellular differentiation (i) affecting barrier
function epithelium, evidenced decrease transepithelial
electrical resistance, (ii) inhibiting activity one major glucose
absorption function, i.e., sodium/glucose cotransport. morphological
level, hiv-1 infection ht-29-d4 cells associated formation of
lumina, representative defect cellular organization. these
morphofunctional perturbations induced hiv-1 could mimicked nocodazole, 
a microtubule-disrupting agent. correspondingly, hiv-1 exposure ht-29-d4 cells
evoked massive disruption microtubules, revealed alpha-tubulin
indirect immunofluorescence staining. similar effect observed after
incubation cells either recombinant gp120 monoclonal antibody
against galactosylceramide (galcer), intestinal receptor hiv-1 gp120,
suggesting effect hiv-1 mediated binding gp120 to
galcer. based data, propose hiv-1 may selectively alter
enterocytic functions direct effect intracellular architecture
of cells. contrast previous theories hiv-1 enteropathy, data 
support concept hiv-1 may perturb intestinal functions without
necessarily infecting intestinal epithelial cells.
