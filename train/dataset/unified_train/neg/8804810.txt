the rising rate germ cell cancer testis past decade been
demonstrated occurring predominantly younger age group (15 19
years) association earlier onset puberty earlier onset regular 
sexual activity. chemicals viruses, atrophogenic effect, remain
the main candidates inducing final common pathway tumor development
and clonal evolution, ie, gonadotropin-driven mitosis spermatogonia. the
possibility different genetic mechanisms regulating susceptibility and
resistance two extreme causes gonadal atrophy families raised
by failure genome screen series sibling pairs testicular
cancer identify single significant linkage group. studies demonstrating high
levels non-mutated p53 protein rapid induction apoptosis by
chemotherapy provide new insight cause exquisite
chemosensitivity tumors. durable responses paclitaxel vitro
activity response temezolamide provide evidence plethora 
agents work tumors, although new first-line therapeutic
approaches reported recently. important clinical trial studied
good-risk patients demonstrated gain benefit reducing
treatment time 12 9 weeks essential retain bleomycin bep 
(bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) regimen. final new idea emerge
recently comes series papers management primary tumors in
patients solitary testis possible use organ-conserving surgery 
plus postoperative radiation. another study suggest might possible to
use preoperative chemotherapy wishing retain spermatogenesis.
