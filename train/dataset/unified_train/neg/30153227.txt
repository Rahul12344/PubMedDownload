background: subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (sspe) slow virus infectious
disease resulting persistent infection mutant measles virus. at
present, effective treatment sspe. interferon-Î± inosine
pranobex used treatment sspe, partial success has
been reported antiviral drug, ribavirin (rbv). standardization of
dosage method necessary carry treatment rbv safely and
effectively. study, rbv concentrations cerebrospinal fluid (csf) 
monitored intraventricular administration using subcutaneous
continuous infusion pump.
methods: three patients new-onset sspe treated rbv using a
subcutaneous continuous infusion pump. days 3-10 start rbv
infusion, csfs obtained lumbar tap, concentration rbv the
csf measured using high-performance liquid chromatography.
results: rbv concentration increased dose-dependent manner 3
patients, target concentration could generally maintained without 
severe side effects. observed clinical symptoms temporarily
relieved case. 2 cases treatment continuing, the
patients remain stage iii, patient discontinued therapy
progressed stage iv.
conclusion: target rbv concentration csf could maintained
continuously intraventricular administration using subcutaneous continuous
infusion pump. accumulation cases necessary confirm the
safety efficacy medical treatment.
