conditional genetic deletion phosphatase tensin homolog (pten) the
sensorimotor cortex neonatal mice enables regeneration corticospinal tract 
(cst) axons spinal cord injury (sci). present study addresses three
questions: (1) whether pten knockdown adult rats nongenetic techniques
enables cst regeneration, (2) whether interventions enable cst regeneration
enhance recovery voluntary motor function, (3) whether delivery salmon 
fibrin injury site enhances cst regeneration motor recovery.
adult rats trained staircase-reaching task received either
intracortical injections aavshpten delete pten control vector
expressing shrna luciferase (aavshluc). rats received cervical dorsal
hemisection injuries salmon fibrin injected injury site half 
the rats, yielding four groups (aavshpten, aavshluc, aavshpten + fibrin, and
aavshluc + fibrin). forepaw function assessed 10 weeks injury and
cst axons traced injecting biotin-conjugated dextran amine the
sensorimotor cortex. rats received aavshpten alone exhibit improved 
motor function, whereas rats received aavshpten salmon fibrin had
significantly higher forelimb-reaching scores. tract tracing revealed cst
axons extended farther caudally group received aavshpten salmon
fibrin versus groups. significant differences lesion size 
between groups. together, data suggest combination pten
deletion salmon fibrin injection lesion significantly improve
voluntary motor function sci enabling regenerative growth cst axons.
