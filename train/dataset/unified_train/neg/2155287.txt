the gm1 strain feline leukaemia virus (felv) isolated naturally
occurring case myeloid leukaemia induces severe haematopoietic
abnormalities, including myeloblastic leukaemia, inoculation cats.
molecular clones felv-gm1 proviruses obtained studied restriction 
enzyme mapping, blot hybridization partial dna sequence analysis. two types
of clone isolated; first replication-competent felv subgroup a,
resembling low minimally pathogenic felv-a isolates; second was
replication-defective extensive deletions mutations gag pol,
although intact env gene subgroup b phenotype. large segments the
defective proviruses, 5' leader sequence upstream gag gene the
5' half env gene, show structural hallmarks endogenous felv-related
proviruses. infectious felv-gm1 viruses recovered transfection tested 
for leukaemogenic potential newborn cats. early polyclonal
myeloproliferative changes observed cats inoculated felv-a/gm1
alone, although pronounced animals receiving full
felv-ab/gm1 complex reconstituted cotransfection defective virus felv-b
with felv-a helper. analysis viruses bone marrow showed that
replication subgroup b component delayed restricted proportion
of cats. infected cats developed persistent abnormalities of
haematopoiesis one progressed disseminated myeloid leukaemia. the
defective recombinant felv-b/gm1 appears play indirect important role
in myeloid leukaemogenesis.
