polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) proinflammatory cytokines been
implicated pathogenesis acute-on-chronic liver failure (aclf). 
utility cxc chemokine receptor expression pmns biomarker for
prediction disease severity still uncertain. study, investigated
the dynamic expression cxcr1 cxcr2 neutrophils, found patients
with hepatitis b virus-related aclf displayed low expression cxcr1 cxcr2
on peripheral neutrophils compared healthy subjects patients with
chronic hepatitis b. expression pattern correlated disease
severity. additionally, increased production il-8 peripheral blood was
significantly associated reduced cxcr1 cxcr2 expression, shown the
decreased cxcr1 cxcr2 expression neutrophils treating neutrophils
with plasma aclf patients. effect could overcomed il-8
blockage anti-il-8 antibody. also found il-8 production and
neutrophil infiltration coordinately increased liver tissue of
hbv-aclf patients, increase associated liver inflammation.
overall, increased production il-8 associated neutrophils infiltration
into liver decreased cxcr1/2 expression peripheral neutrophils. cxcr1 
and cxcr2 expression levels could served early markers predict the
severity aclf.
