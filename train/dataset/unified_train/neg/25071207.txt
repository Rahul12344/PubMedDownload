viral lethal mutagenesis strategy whereby innate immune system or
mutagenic pool nucleotides increase error rate viral replication the
error catastrophe limit. lethal mutagenesis proposed mechanism 
several antiviral compounds, including drug candidate
5-aza-5,6-dihydro-2'-deoxycytidine (kp1212), causes a-to-g g-to-a
mutations hiv genome, tissue culture hiv positive patients 
undergoing kp1212 monotherapy. work explored molecular mechanism(s)
underlying mutagenicity kp1212, specifically whether tautomerism, a
previously proposed hypothesis, could explain biological consequences this
nucleoside analog. establishing tautomerism nucleic acid bases under
physiological conditions challenging lack sensitive
methods. study investigated tautomerism using array spectroscopic,
theoretical, chemical biology approaches. variable temperature nmr 2d
infrared spectroscopic methods demonstrated kp1212 existed broad
ensemble interconverting tautomers, among enolic forms dominated. the
mutagenic properties kp1212 determined empirically vitro in
vivo replication single-stranded vector containing single kp1212. was
found kp1212 paired (10%) g (90%), accord with
clinical observations. moreover, mutation frequency sufficient for
pushing viral population error catastrophe limit, observed before
in cell culture studies. finally, model proposed correlates the
mutagenicity kp1212 tautomeric distribution solution.
