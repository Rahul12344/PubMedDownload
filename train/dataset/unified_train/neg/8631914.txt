phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3'-kinases family lipid kinases implicated 
the regulation cell growth oncogene products tyrosine kinase growth
factor receptors. catalytic subunit p85/p110 pi 3'-kinase is
homologous vps-34, phosphatidylinositol-specific lipid kinase involved in
the sorting newly synthesized hydrolases yeast vacuole. suggests
that pi 3'-kinases may play analogous roles mammalian cells. measured 
a number secretory endocytic trafficking events chinese hamster ovary
cells presence wortmannin, potent inhibitor pi 3'-kinase.
wortmannin caused 40-50% down-regulation surface transferrin receptors, with
a dose dependence identical required maximal inhibition the
p85/p110 pi 3'-kinase intact cells. redistribution transferrin
receptors reflected 60% increase internalization rate 35% decrease
in recycling rate. experiments fluorescent transferrin showed entry
of transferrin receptors recycling compartment efflux receptors
out compartment slowed wortmannin. wortmannin altered the
morphology recycling compartment, vesiculated in
untreated cells. using semliki forest virus probe, also found that
delivery endocytosed virus lysosomal site degradation slowed
by wortmannin, whereas endosomal acidification unaffected. contrast to
these effects endocytosis recycling, wortmannin affect
intracellular processing newly synthesized viral spike proteins. wortmannin
did induce missorting lysosomal enzyme cathepsin secretory
pathway, dose 20-fold greater required inhibit
p85/p110 pi 3'-kinase activity redistribute transferrin receptors. data
demonstrate presence wortmannin-sensitive enzymes three distinct steps 
of endocytic cycle chinese hamster ovary cells: internalization, transit
from early endosomes recycling degradative compartments, transit
from recycling compartment back cell surface. wortmannin-sensitive
enzymes critical endocytosis recycling distinct involved
in sorting newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes.
