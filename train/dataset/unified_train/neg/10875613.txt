strains human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) use coreceptor
cxcr4 (x4 strains) become laboratory adapted (la) selected ability to
replicate leukemic cell lines h9. compared patient x4 viruses, 
the gp120-gp41 complexes la viruses constellation common properties 
including enhanced affinities cd4, greater sensitivities inactivations 
diverse antibodies soluble cd4, increased shedding gp120, improved 
abilities infect hela-cd4 cell clones contain trace quantities of
cd4. common characteristics, may result concerted structural
rearrangement gp120-gp41 complexes, made difficult identify a
specific feature critical laboratory adaptation. test the
hypothesis replication patient x4 hiv-1 limited low cd4
concentration h9 cells (7.0 x 10(3) cd4/cell), constructed h9 derivatives
that express least 10 times receptor. interestingly, patient
x4 isolates readily grew derivative cells, resulting virus
preparations retained characteristics primary viruses throughout multiple 
passages. contrast, selection viruses parental h9 cells
resulted outgrowth la derivatives. conclude weak interaction of
patient x4 hiv-1 isolates cd4 primary factor limits their
replication leukemic cell lines.
