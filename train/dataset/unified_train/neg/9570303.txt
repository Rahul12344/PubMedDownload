cancer vaccines utilize genetically modified tumor cells require gene
transfer methods capable producing immunostimulatory doses transgenes 
fresh short-term cultures human tumor cells. studies optimize vitro 
transfection primary tumor cells using cationic lipids plasmid encoding 
the gene human interleukin-2 (il-2). established tumor cell lines produced
10- 100-fold il-2 fresh short-term tumor cultures measured
by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent analysis. importantly, transfection primary
tumor cells produced immunostimulatory levels il-2 determined increased 
thymidine incorporation autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
lymphokine-activated killer cell activity. il-2 secretion tumor cells
persisted least 30 days post-transfection unaffected freeze
thawing irradiation 8000 rads. multiple solid tumor types successfully
transfected, normal blood mononuclear cells leukemic blasts were
resistant transfection. enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent analysis amount
of il-2 secreted medium transfected tumor cells correlated the
percentage tumor cells expressing intracellular il-2 measured flow
cytometry. plasmids utilizing cytomegalovirus promoter yielded superior
transfection efficiencies compared plasmids containing rous sarcoma virus 
promoter. results suggest clinical vaccine trial using autologous
tumor cells genetically modified secrete il-2 feasible patients with
solid tumors.
