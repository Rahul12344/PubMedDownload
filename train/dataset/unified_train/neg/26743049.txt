cryoem continues produce density maps larger complex assemblies
with multiple protein components mixed symmetries. resolution always
uniform throughout cryoem map, useful estimate resolution 
in specific molecular components large assembly. study, present
procedures 1) estimate resolution subcomponents gold-standard
fourier shell correlation (fsc); 2) validate modeling procedures, particularly at
medium resolutions, include loop modeling flexible fitting; 3) 
build probabilistic models combine high-accuracy priors (such as
crystallographic structures) medium-resolution cryoem densities. an
example, apply methods new cryoem maps mature bacteriophage
p22, reconstructed without imposing icosahedral symmetry. resolution estimates
based gold-standard fsc show highest resolution coat region
(7.6 å), whereas components slightly lower resolutions: portal
(9.2 å), hub (8.5 å), tailspike (10.9 å), needle (10.5 å). differences 
are indicative inherent structural heterogeneity and/or reconstruction
accuracy different subcomponents map. probabilistic models these
subcomponents provide new insights, knowledge, structural information 
when taking account uncertainty given limitations observed
density.
