in randomised double-blind trial, 51 5--10% dehydrated infants rehydrated 
with oral electrolyte solutions containing sucrose glucose. infants in
both groups successfully rehydrated, sucrose solution produced a
slower correction electrolyte abnormalities higher percentage of
patients needed 24 h therapy. adequate knowledge 
of oral therapy method sucrose substitute glucose many cases;
where choice glucose recommended.

pip: 51 infants aged 3 12 months dehydration due acute watery diarrhea
were randomly assigned either glucose sucrose oral therapy group on
admission hospital. oral rehydration maintenance without any
intravenous fluids successful 100% 92% patients glucose 
sucrose groups respectively, evidenced subjects' weight gain, fall in
plasma proteins hematocrit, disappearance clinical signs of
dehydration. greater improvement mean hc03 glucose group
than sucrose group. groups exhibited decline mean serum
osmolarity. 2 oral treatment failures sucrose group occurred in
patients could absorb solutions adequately. study shows that
oral therapy sucrose less efficient oral therapy glucose.
however, areas sucrose available knowledge means
of using oral therapy exist, oral sucrose solution used treat 
infants diarrhea 5 10% dehydration.
