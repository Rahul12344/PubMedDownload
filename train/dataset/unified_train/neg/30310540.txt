aim: characterize antiviral therapy eligibility among hepatitis b virus
(hbv)-infected adults university hospital zambia.
methods: hepatitis b surface antigen-positive adults (n = 160) were
hiv-negative referred hospital routine clinically-driven
hbv test enrolled. alanine aminotransferase (alt), aspartate
aminotransferase (ast), platelet count, hepatitis b e-antigen, hbv dna were
measured. liver fibrosis/cirrhosis assessed physical examination,
ast-to-platelet ratio index, transient elastography. antiviral
therapy-naïve individuals, described hbv stages antiviral therapy
eligibility per world health organization (who) hbv test (routine vs
clinical). elevated alt > 19 women > 30 u/l men. among
treatment-experienced individuals, described medication side effects,
adherence, viral suppression.
results: median age 33 years, 71.9% men, 30.9% diagnosed
with hbv clinically-driven test remainder identified via
routine testing (at blood bank, community events, etc.). among 120
treatment-naïve individuals, 2.5% categorized immune tolerant, 11.7% were
immune active, 35.6% inactive carriers, 46.7% indeterminate
phenotype. per guidelines, 13 (10.8%) eligible immediate antiviral
therapy. odds eligibility eight times higher diagnosed at
clinical vs routine settings (adjusted odds ratio, 8.33; 95%ci: 2.26-29.41).
among 40 treatment-experienced hbv patients, virtually took tenofovir, 
history mild side effects reported 20%. though reported adherence was
good, 12 29 (41.4%) hbv dna > 20 iu/ml.
conclusion: approximately one ten hbv-monoinfected zambians eligible 
antivirals. many indeterminate phenotype needed clinical follow-up.
