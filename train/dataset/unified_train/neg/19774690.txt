although low prevalence rate (around 1% population) of
infection hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus (hcv) chile,
little known diversity molecular characteristics the
circulating viruses. present study, 40 hbv 57 hcv samples from
santiago city, chile, examined. phylogenetic analysis hbv samples
showed autochthonous genotype f represented genotype study
(67.5%), genotypes a, b, c, less frequent (7.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and
12.5%, respectively). frequency circulation hbv genotypes observed is
in accordance genetic background chilean population. 
hcv samples tested belonged subtype 1b (82%). coalescent analysis
conducted ns5a ns5b regions hcv strains showed similar
population growth rates, recent common ancestor estimated date
between 1893 1901. result may indicate genotype 1b strains
circulating chile epidemiological features similar described for
hcv genotype 1b brazil united states. however, recent common 
ancestor chile older reported recently genotype 1b in
argentina.
