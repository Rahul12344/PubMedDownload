tropical spastic paraparesis/htlv-i associated myelopathy (tsp/ham), is
characterized infiltration human cell leukaemia virus type-i
(htlv-i)-infected t-cells, anti-htlv-i cytotoxic cells macrophages the
patients' cerebrospinal fluid intrathecally formed anti-htlv-i antibodies.
this implies disease involves breakdown blood-brain barrier.
since astrocytes play central role establishing barrier, authors
investigated hypothesis htlv-i infected cells disrupt barrier
by damaging astrocytes. present study revealed htlv-i-producing t
cells conferred severe cytopathic effect upon monolayers astrocytoma cell
line co-cultures. following co-cultivation, htlv-i dna proteins appeared
in monolayer cells, reaching peak level gradually declined.
this appearance viral components proved result fusion the
astrocytic cells virus-producing cells, whereas subsequent
decline reflected destruction resulting syncytia. fusion could be
specifically blocked anti htlv-i env antibodies, indicating was
mediated viral env proteins expressed surface the
virus-producing cells. similar fusion observed htlv-i-producing
cells certain human nervous system cell lines. fusion of
htlv-i-infected cells occurs also astrocytes nervous system
cells tsp/ham patients, may account, least partially, the
blood-brain barrier breakdown neural lesions syndrome.
