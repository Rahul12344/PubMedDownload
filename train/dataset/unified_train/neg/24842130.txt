background study aims: liver disease chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection ranges minimal lesion liver cirrhosis sometimes eventually 
evolving hepatocellular carcinoma. whether hcv determines different
clinical histological manifestation disease fully understood.
it clearly elucidated whether extent liver injury induced 
hcv influenced mainly direct cytopathic damage immune-mediated
response hcv-infected hepatocytes. aim study verify
whether amount virus individual patient's serum could related the
severity liver injury.
patients methods: study carried gastroenterology and
hepatology teaching hospital, medical city, baghdad. serum levels hcv-rna were
measured 27 patients chronic hcv using b-dna assay. core liver biopsies
of patients evaluated according ishak histological activity index
system.
results: serum hcv rna concentrations patients ranged 3.2×10(3)
to 1.2×10(7)copies/ml. patients correlation observed the
variable levels viraemia age patients. furthermore no
correlations observed serum hcv rna concentrations the
biochemical liver function test levels: total serum bilirubin, ast, alt, and
alkaline phosphatase. histologically; patients categorized four
subgroups: four patients (14.8%) minimal activity, 17 patients (63%) mild
activity, six patients (22.2%) moderate activity. significant
correlation found viraemic levels histological findings 
their individual components: interface hepatitis, confluent necrosis,
intralobular liver cell necrosis portal inflammation. according stage 
of fibrosis, patients categorized seven subgroups: one patient 
(3.7%) stage zero, seven patients stage one (25.9%), four patients with
stage two (14.9%), eight patients stage three (29.6%), three patients with
stage four (11.1%), two patients stage five (7.4%), two patients in
cirrhotic stage six (7.4%). correlation serum hcv rna
concentration stage fibrosis. hepatic steatosis observed 16/27 
patients. mild nine patients, moderate five patients, severe 
two patients. correlation observed serum hcv rna
viraemic level severity steatosis.
conclusion: serum hcv-rna level determine degree hepatic injury
precisely liver biopsy necessary accurately evaluate extent of
liver damage.
