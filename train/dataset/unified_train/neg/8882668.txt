objective: reveal possible impairment plasminogen activator system in
the pulmonary infections aids patients.
design: test plasminogen activator system functionality alveolar
macrophages bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) control subjects aids 
patients. procedures designed detect presence imbalance in
plasminogen activator activity ascertain imbalance due a
direct effect hiv virus macrophages superimposed opportunistic
infection.
methods: alveolar macrophages obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) were
either lysed triton x-100 cultured 24 h. plasminogen activators and
plasminogen activator inhibitors (pai) measured chromogenic substrate
assay binding 125i-urokinase followed 10% sodium dodecyl-sulphate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page), respectively.
results: plasminogen activator activity balf alveolar macrophages 
aids patients decreased. reduction independent presence an
infectious pulmonary process. contrast, free pai increased aids
patients pneumocystis carinii infection. increase possibly caused by
a different glycosylated form pai-2.
conclusions: data support view pulmonary fibrogenic response 
in part secondary imbalance within plasminogen activator system and
provide basis clarifying role alterations the
pathophysiology aids-related pulmonary infections.
