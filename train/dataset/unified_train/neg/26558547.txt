objective: objective study understand spread hiv among
and age racial/ethnic groups men engage male-to-male sexual
contact (msm) united states.
design: analysis hiv-1 pol sequences msm collected us
national hiv surveillance system (nhss) 2001-2012.
methods: pairwise genetic distance calculated determine potential
transmission partners (those closely related nucleotide sequences, i.e.
distance â‰¤1.5%). described race/ethnicity age potential transmission
partners msm.
results: 23 048 msm hiv sequences submitted nhss 2000-2012, 
identified potential transmission partners 8880 (39%). potential
transmission partners race/ethnicity (78% for
blacks/african-americans, 64% whites 49% hispanics/latinos). this
assortative mixing even pronounced youngest age groups.
significantly fewer young black/african-american hispanic/latino msm had
older potential transmission partners young white msm.
conclusion: black/african-american msm, profoundly affected hiv, 
were likely potential hiv transmission partners same
race/ethnicity similar age, suggesting disparities hiv infections 
are large part due age-disassortative relationships. concerted efforts 
to increase access preexposure prophylaxis, quality hiv care effective
treatment needed interrupt transmission chains among young,
black/african-american msm.
