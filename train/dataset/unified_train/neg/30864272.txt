background: recipients solid organ transplants prone various
complications seldom encountered immunocompetent individuals.
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (ptld) best known and
commonest epstein-barr virus (ebv)-associated malignancy post solid organ
transplant. ebv-associated smooth muscle tumors (ebv-smt) including leiomyomas
and leiomyosarcomas rare much less studied ptld. recently
encountered two cases ebv-smt post lung transplantation summarize 
their clinical features course together literature review.
method: clinical data treatment details two patients developed ebv-smt
were reviewed retrieved december 31, 2017. english literature was
searched pubmed database 1965 2017 studies the
association lung transplant ebv-smt.
results: incidence ptld higher among lung transplant recipients
compared kidney transplant recipients, observation attributed
to stronger immune suppression lung patients. ebv-smt showed higher
incidence among kidney recipients among lung recipients, suggesting the
degree immunosuppression may less important factor development 
ebv-smt. ebv-smt often seen among lung transplant recipients with
ebv mismatch.
conclusions: ebv-smt rare tumor, incidence, risk factors, and
optimal management well-defined study needed.
