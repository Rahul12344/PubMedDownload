a strain trichomonas vaginalis infected double-stranded rna virus
showed pronounced cytopathology form giant syncytia generated the
recruitment single cells. giant cells ultimately lysed, releasing virus
into culture medium. infected cells, clusters electron-dense
particles resembling viral structures found cytoplasm. addition,
distinctive inclusions composed similar particles present nuclei
of cells. double-stranded viral rna 5.5 kbp demonstrated both
cytoplasmic nuclear fractions cells. viral particles collected
from cell-free culture supernatant shape size rna
virus isolated strain t. vaginalis described previously (wang & wang,
journal biological chemistry, 260: 3697-3702, 1985; wang & wang, proceedings
of national academy sciences u.s.a. 83: 7956-7960, 1986) does
not show cytopathology.
