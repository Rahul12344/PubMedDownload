central nervous system (cns) infection c57bl/6 mice te strain of
sindbis virus (sinv) provides valuable animal model studying the
pathogenesis alphavirus encephalomyelitis. sinv te inoculated
intracranially causes little mortality, 20-30 % mice inoculated intranasally
(in) died 8 11 days infection, period immune cells
typically infiltrate brain clear infectious virus. examine the
mechanism behind mortality, mice infected sinv te monitored 
evidence neurological disease, signs severe disease
(moribund) sacrificed tissues collected. mice showing usual mild
signs encephalomyelitis concurrently sacrificed serve time-matched 
controls (sick). sixty-eight per cent moribund mice, none sick 
mice, showed upper gastrointestinal bleeding due gastric ulceration. clinical 
disease gastrointestinal pathology could attributed direct viral
infection tissues outside cns, brain pathology inflammation
were comparable sick moribund mice. however, sinv antigen present
in brains moribund mice, clearance infectious virus cns
was delayed compared sick mice. lower levels sinv-specific igm fewer
b220+ b cells present brains moribund mice compared sick mice, 
despite similar levels antiviral igm igg serum. findings
highlight importance local antibody response determining the
outcome viral encephalomyelitis offer model system understanding
