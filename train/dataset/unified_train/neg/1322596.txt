rna polymerase ii encounters elongation block stalls vivo during
transcription late strand polyomavirus dna. study, performed
transcriptional run-on assays localized stalling site 164-nucleotide
region (nt 11-175) contains specific binding sites polyomavirus large 
antigen. effect large antigen elongation rna polymerase ii through
this region examined cells infected mutant polyomavirus (at3-ts25e)
which encodes thermolabile large antigen. removal functional large t
antigen shifting nonpermissive temperature (39 degrees) eliminated
stalling rna polymerase region, although rna polymerases transcribing 
other regions viral genome unaffected. rna polymerase resumed
stalling functional large antigen allowed accumulate by
shifting back permissive temperature (32 degrees). conclude that
stalling rna polymerase ii vivo dependent presence functional 
large antigen.
