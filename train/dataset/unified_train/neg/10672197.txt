recombinant adenovirus, expressing cs protein plasmodium yoelii, adpycs,
was shown induce comparable degree cell-mediated protection against
malaria single dose irradiated p. yoelii sporozoites, causing inhibition 
of liver stage development. report differently from
sporozoite-induced immunity, interferon (ifn)-gamma mediate the
protective immunity induced adpycs, since similar degree protection was
observed adpycs immunized mice lacking ifn-gamma-/- ifn-gamma receptor
(ifn-gammar-/-) compared wild-type mice. depletion cd8+ cells
from immunized mice almost completely abolished adpycs-induced
immunity, indicating immunization adpycs induces cd8+ t
cell-mediated protective anti-malaria immunity, independent of
ifn-gamma.
