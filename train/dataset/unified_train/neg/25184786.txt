interferons represent one first essential host defense mechanisms
after infection, activation ifn-pathway results the
transcriptional activation hundreds interferon-stimulated genes. the
alpha-inducible protein 27 like 2a (ifi27l2a) gene (human synonym: isg12) is
strongly up-regulated lung influenza infection mice has
been shown gene expression studies highly correlated activated 
genes. therefore, investigated role ifi27l2a host defense to
influenza infections detail. rt-pcr analyses non-infected mice
demonstrated ifi27l2a expressed several tissues, including lung. 
detailed analyses reporter gene expression lungs ifi27l2a-lacz mice
revealed ifi27l2a expressed macrophages lymphocytes in
alveolar cells bronchiolar epithelium cells. number macrophages and
lymphocyte strongly increased lung infection, significant
increase expression levels lacz reporter gene found within
individual immune cells. also, reporter gene expression found in
bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar cells infiltrating neutrophils after
infection. thus, up-regulation ifi27l2a infected lungs mainly due the
infiltration macrophages lymphocytes. surprisingly, deletion of
ifi27l2a mouse knock-out lines result increased susceptibility to
infections h1n1 h7n7 influenza virus compared wild type c57bl/6n
mice, suggesting less important role gene host response to
influenza infections bacterial infections.
