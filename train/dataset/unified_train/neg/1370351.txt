the virulent satellite [satellite c (sat c)] turnip crinkle virus (tcv) a
small pathogenic rna intensifies symptoms tcv-infected turnip plants
(brassica campestris). virulence sat c determined properties 
satellite influenced helper virus. symptoms produced in
infections sat c differ severity depending helper virus. the
tcv-ji helper virus produces severe symptoms tcv-b helper virus
when inoculated sat c. find determinants tcv helper virus genome
that affect satellite virulence, tcv-ji genome cloned sequence
compared tcv-b genome. genomes found differ five base 
changes, one base changes, nucleotide position 1025, produced 
an amino acid change, aspartic acid----glycine putative viral
replicase. chimeric tcv genome (tcv-b/ji) containing four five base
changes (including base change position 1025) mutant tcv-b genome
(tcv-b1025g) containing single base substitution position 1025 converted the
tcv-b genome form produces severe symptoms sat c. base
change position 1025 located helicase putative viral
replicase, symptom intensification appears result differences 
rate replication satellite supported two helper viruses.
