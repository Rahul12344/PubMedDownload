in tobacco mosaic virus (tmv)-infected tobacco plants carrying n resistance
gene, hypersensitive reaction response (hr) occurs enclose virus in
the infected tissue. although contribution peroxidases resistance has
been proposed, evidence presented tobacco peroxidase genes
respond hr. here, describe hr-induced expression tobacco
peroxidase gene (tpoxc1) whose induction kinetics slightly different from
those acidic basic tobacco pathogenesis-related (pr) protein genes.
interestingly, tpoxc1 insensitive inducers pr genes as
salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethephon. spermine activated tpoxc1 gene
expression low level acidic basic pr gene expression a
considerably higher level. results indicate induced expression 
tpoxc1 regulated differently classical tobacco pr genes n 
gene-mediated self-defense system tobacco plants.
