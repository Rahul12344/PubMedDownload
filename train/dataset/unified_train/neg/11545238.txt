oral pseudomembranous candidiasis (opc) evaluated 61 patients receiving
head neck radiotherapy (rt). herpes simplex virus-1 (hsv-1) reactivation 
also investigated 14 patients. according agreed protocol,
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf) mouthwash was
administered 46 patients radiation-induced ulcers. candidiasis was
diagnosed 31 patients. candida albicans frequent isolate.
multiple candida species isolated lesions four patients.
concurrent candidiasis radiation-induced ulcers observed 17 patients.
viral culture polymerase chain reaction disclosed presence hsv-1
in five patients. twenty 46 patients, initial mucositis grade ii 
grade iii, completed rt mucositis grade i, indicating beneficial effect of
gmcsf mouthwash, although controlled studies necessary verify
that. conclusion, opc important infection patients undergoing
