treatment chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection direct-acting
antivirals (daas) results sustained virologic response (svr) most
patients. highly efficacious, ~3%-5% patients achieve svr despite
having virus appears susceptible. unclear whether host factors
contribute treatment failures, although innate adaptive immunity may play 
a role. previous studies showed daa treatment, composition of
intrahepatic immune cells normalize relative healthy volunteers, even
in cases svr achieved. used paired pre- post-treatment liver
biopsies 13 patients treated sofosbuvir ribavirin, 4 whom
relapsed, analyse intracellular immune changes daa treatment and
explore correlations inflammation treatment outcome. performed single
marker immunohistochemistry followed electronic image capture, manual
annotation parenchymal non-parenchymal regions, quantitative image
analysis. predominant cellular change treatment decrease cd8+
cellular density parenchymal non-parenchymal regions. cd68+ kupffer
cell density correlated hepatic inflammation (ast, alt) pre-treatment, but
did change treatment. cd4+ cellular density decreased in
non-parenchymal regions and, intriguingly, lower pre-treatment subjects
who eventually relapsed. cellular markers (cd56, cd20), well markers 
of apoptosis (tia-1) activated stellate cells, change significantly
during treatment differ treatment outcome. predominant intrahepatic
cellular change daa treatment chronic hcv infection reduction in
cd8+ cellular density, correlate treatment outcome.
