e4tf1 originally identified one transcription factors responsible
for adenovirus e4 gene transcription. composed two subunits, dna
binding protein molecular mass 60 kda 53-kda
transcription-activating protein. heterodimerization two subunits is
essential protein function transcription factor. study,
we identified new e4tf1 subunit, designated e4tf1-47, dna binding 
activity associate e4tf1-60. cloned cdnas of
the e4tf1 subunits. e4tf1 purified, partial amino acid sequence of
each subunit determined. predicted amino acid sequence cdna clone
revealed e4tf1-60 ets domain, dna binding domain common to
ets-related transcription factors. e4tf1-53 four tandemly repeated
notch-ankyrin motifs. putative cdna e4tf1-47 coded almost amino
acid sequences e4tf1-53. three hundred thirty-two amino acids n
termini e4tf1-47 -53 identical except one amino acid insertion in
e4tf1-53, differ c terminus. three
recombinant cdna clones expressed escherichia coli, proteins
behaved manner purified proteins gel retardation assay.
nucleotide predicted amino acid sequences highly homologous to
gabp-alpha -beta, supported observation that
gabp-specific antibody recognize human e4tf1.
