background: children born prematurely surviving cerebral ischemia
there white matter abnormalities correlate neurological
dysfunction. since injury occurs immature brain, majority of
subventricular zone (svz) cells generate white matter oligodendrocytes, sought
to study effect injury gliogenesis svz. hypothesized 
that aberrant glial cell generation svz neonatal hypoxia 
ischemia (h/i) contributes increased astrogliogenesis concomitant
oligodendroglial insufficiency. mechanistically hypothesized increase 
in specific locally produced cytokines recovery injury modifying
the differentiation glial progenitors towards astrocytes expense the
more developmentally-appropriate oligodendrocytes.
methodology/principal finding: studies used vannucci h/i rat
model p6 rats subjected unilateral common carotid ligation followed 
by 75 min systemic hypoxia. retroviral lineage tracing studies combined with
morphological immunohistochemical analyses revealed preferential
generation svz-derived white matter astrocytes instead oligodendrocytes
post hypoxia/ischemia. microarray qrt-pcr analyses damaged svz showed 
increased expression several cytokines receptors known promote
astrocyte differentiation, egf, lif tgfbeta1 signaling components.
using gliospheres model neonatal svz, evaluated effects these
cytokines signal transduction pathways regulating astrocyte generation,
proliferation differentiation. studies demonstrated combinations
of egf, lif tgfbeta1 reconstituted increased astrogliogenesis.
tgfbeta1-induced smad 2/3 phosphorylation combination egf, lif and
tgfbeta1 synergistically increased stat3 phosphorylation single double
cytokine combinations. pharmacologically inhibiting alk5 signaling vitro
antagonized tgfbeta1-induced increase astrocyte generation and
antagonizing alk5 signaling vivo similarly inhibited astrogliogenesis within
the svz recovery h/i.
conclusion/significance: altogether, data indicate aberrant
specification glial precursors within neonatal svz recovery from
neonatal h/i consequence altered cytokine signaling. studies
further suggest antagonizing alk5 receptor restore normal
pattern cell differentiation injury immature brain.
