the major goal therapeutic cancer vaccine trials mediate tumor
regression. however, critically important devise vitro immunological 
assays correlate clinical outcome, use surrogate markers of
vaccine efficacy. date, clinical emphasis placed peptide vaccines,
but trends towards use complex immunogens whole proteins
require development efficient sensitive methods monitoring their
immunological effects. context vaccination trial using full-length
tyrosinase (ty) immunize patients metastatic melanoma, monitoring
technique developed autologous dendritic cells (dc) infected 
recombinant adenovirus encoding ty protein used assess the
ty-specific reactivity fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes (pbl) collected from
patients different intervals therapy. quantitative real-time rt-pcr
(qrt-pcr) used measure production cytokine mrna cells
following 2.5-h incubation ty-expressing dc. two ten patients
studied demonstrated ty protein-specific reactivity increased and
after period vaccination. one patients also reacted an
hla-a1-compatible ty peptide, second recognize known ty
epitopes, highlighting importance technique monitoring the
effects complex vaccines.
