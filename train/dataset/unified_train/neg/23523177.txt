mucosal-associated invariant (mait) cells play important physiological role 
in host pathogen defense may also involved inflammatory disorders and
multiple sclerosis. rarity inefficient expansion cells have
hampered detailed analysis application. here, report induced
pluripotent stem cell (ipsc)-based reprogramming approach expansion of
functional mait cells. found human mait cells reprogrammed into
ipscs using sendai virus harboring standard reprogramming factors. under
t cell-permissive conditions, ipscs efficiently redifferentiate into
mait-like lymphocytes expressing t cell receptor vα7.2, cd161, and
interleukin-18 receptor chain α. upon incubation bacteria-fed monocytes, the
derived mait cells show enhanced production broad range cytokines.
following adoptive transfer immunocompromised mice, cells migrate to
the bone marrow, liver, spleen, intestine protect mycobacterium
abscessus. findings pave way functional analysis mait
cells determination therapeutic potential.
