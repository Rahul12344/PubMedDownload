adenovirus infection allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(hsct) emerging pathogen causing relevant morbidity mortality, with
preponderance children. last years, basic research biology
of virus host immune response ameliorated diagnostic, surveillance,
and therapeutic strategies. risk factors infection commonly impact on
t-cell reconstitution, t-cell depleted graft, unrelated hla-mismatched
donor transplantation, gvhd. weekly surveillance pcr stool blood
till day 100 longer post-hsct pre-emptive therapy cidofovir the
mainstay current approach adenoviral infections post-hsct. since a
sufficient host t-cell response essential clear virus, diagnostic
procedures detection virus-specific t-cells recently developed
to assess risk infection. furthermore, adoptive immunotherapy new
treatment option patients absent specific t-cell response present
systemic adenoviral infection.
