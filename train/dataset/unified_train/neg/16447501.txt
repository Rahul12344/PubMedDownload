such infections industrial circuit densely populated poultry areas
(dppas) resulted massive spread, early attempts control ai by
stamping-out restriction policies resulted death culling millions of
birds. re-emergence introduction ai viruses dppa
resulted development emergency vaccination programme based the
use heterologous vaccination companion discriminatory test. enabling 
the detection field exposure vaccinated animals, application this
system, conjunction monitoring programme well-defined territorial
strategy resulted eradication h7n1 h7n3 epidemics occurred
between 2000 2004. retrospective analysis ai outbreaks in
north-eastern italy coupled surveillance programmes wild birds in
hobby flocks indicating certain areas continuous high risk of
infection, rationale developing implementing bivalent h5/h7
pilot vaccination programme restricted area dppa. laboratory and
field evidence indicate vaccinated animals resistant challenge
and shed lower amounts virus, thus acting tool prevention and
control, thus limiting impact ai infections.
