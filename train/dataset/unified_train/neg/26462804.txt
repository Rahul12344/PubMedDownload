dengue mosquito-borne viral disease rapidly spread regions
of world recent years. female mosquitoes, mainly aedes aegypti, transmit
dengue. approximately 3,900 million people, 128 countries, risk of
dengue infection. recently, focus provided potential of
green-synthesized nanoparticles inhibitors production dengue viral
envelope (e) protein vero cells downregulators expression dengue
viral e gene. algae outstanding reservoir novel compounds, may
help fight mosquito-borne diseases. research, silver
nanoparticles (agnp) rapidly synthesized using cheap extract alga
centroceras clavulatum. agnp characterized uv–vis spectrophotometry,
fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), scanning electron microscopy
(sem), energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (edx), x-ray diffraction (xrd).
in mosquitocidal assays, lc50 values c. clavulatum extract a. aegypti 
larvae pupae 269.361 ppm (larva i), 309.698 ppm (larva ii), 348.325 ppm 
(larva iii), 387.637 ppm (larva iv), 446.262 ppm (pupa). c. clavulatum
extract also exhibited moderate antioxidant activity, in
2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) nitric oxide (no) radical scavenging
assays. lc50 values c. clavulatum-synthesized agnp 21.460 ppm (larva i), 
23.579 ppm (larva ii), 25.912 ppm (larva iii), 29.155 ppm (larva iv), 33.877 
ppm (pupa). furthermore, c. clavulatum-synthesized agnp inhibited dengue
(serotype dengue virus type-2 (den-2)) viral replication vero cells. notably, 
50 μg/ml green-synthesized agnp showed cytotoxicity vero cells while
reduced den-2 viral growth 80%; 12.5 μg/ml inhibited viral growth of
more 50%. cellular internalization assays highlighted untreated
infected cells showed high intensity fluorescence emission, denotes high
level viral internalization. conversely, agnp-treated infected cells showed
reduced levels fluorescence, failing show significant viral load. overall, 
our study showed alga-mediated synthesis metal nanoparticles may be
considered develop newer, safer, cheap tools fight the
dengue virus, serotype den-2, vector a. aegypti, little cytotoxicity
on mammalian cells.
