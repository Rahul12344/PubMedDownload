ddx6 (rck/p54), member dead-box family helicases, highly conserved
from unicellular eukaryotes vertebrates. functions ddx6 orthologs
in dynamic ribonucleoproteins contribute global transcript-specific
messenger rna (mrna) storage, translational repression, decay during
development differentiation germline somatic cells. role in
pathways promote mrna-specific alternative translation initiation been
shown linked cellular homeostasis, deregulated tissue development, and
the control gene expression rna viruses. recently, ddx6 found to
participate mrna regulation mediated mirna-mediated silencing. ddx6 its
orthologs versatile functions mrna metabolism, characterize as
important post-transcriptional regulators gene expression.
