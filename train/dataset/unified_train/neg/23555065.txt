diagnosis progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy usually based the
clinical presentation, demonstration brain lesions magnetic 
resonance imaging examination, detection jc virus dna the
cerebrospinal fluid high sensitive polymerase chain reaction. role of
magnetic resonance imaging specifically natalizumab-associated progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy strengthening, gaining importance not
only irreplaceable diagnostic tool also surveillance risk
stratifying tool treated patients. imaging techniques as
computed tomography lack sensitivity specificity, magnetic resonance
performed morphological functional sequences offers clinicians the
possibility early identify stage disease emergence an
