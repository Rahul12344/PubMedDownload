introduction: chikungunya virus (chikv) re-emerging pathogen responsible for
causing outbreaks febrile disease accompanied debilitating joint pain.
symptoms typically persist two weeks, severe chronic chikungunya
illnesses reported, especially elderly. currently, 
licensed vaccines antivirals chikv available. study, we
combined chik virus-like particle (vlp) vaccine different adjuvants to
enhance immunogenicity protection both, adult aged mice.
methods: chik vlp-based vaccines tested 6-8-week-old (adult) and
18-24-month-old (aged) female c57bl/6j mice. formulations contained chik vlp
alone adjuvants: quila, r848, imject alum. mice vaccinated three times
via intramuscular injections. chikv-specific antibody responses were
characterized igg subclass using elisa, microneutralization assays. 
addition, chikv infections characterized vaccinated non-vaccinated
adult mice compared aged mice.
results: adult mice, chikv infection right hind foot induced
significant swelling, peaked day 7 post-infection approximately 170% 
of initial size. viral titers peaked 2.53 × 1010 ccid50/ml day 2
post-infection. mice vaccinated chik vlp-based vaccines developed robust
anti-chikv-specific igg antibody responses capable neutralizing
chikv vitro. chik vlp alone chik plus quila administered im injections
protected 100% mice chikv. contrast, antibody responses
elicited vlp-based vaccines attenuated aged mice, negligible 
neutralizing antibody titers detected. unvaccinated, aged mice resistant 
chikv infection, vaccination chikv vlps exacerbated disease.
conclusions: unadjuvanted chik vlp vaccination elicits immune responses that
protect 100% adult mice chikv infection. however, improved
vaccine/adjuvant combination still necessary enhance protective
immunity chikv aged.
