hepatitis c virus (hcv) core viral structural protein; also participates 
in cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. however, the
mechanisms core-mediated transcriptional regulation remain poorly understood. 
oncogenic virus proteins often target p300/cbp, known co-activator wide
variety transcription factors, regulate expression cellular and
viral genes. demonstrate, first time, hcv core protein
interacts p300/cbp enhances acetyl-transferase and
transcriptional activities. addition, demonstrate nuclear core protein
activates nh2-terminal transcription activation domain (tad) nf-at1 a
p300/cbp-dependent manner. propose model core protein regulates the
co-activation function p300/cbp activates nf-at1, probably other
p300/cbp-regulated transcription factors, novel mechanism involving the
regulation acetylation state histones and/or components the
transcriptional machinery.
