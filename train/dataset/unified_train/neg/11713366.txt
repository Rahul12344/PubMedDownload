background: glucocorticoids (gc) dexamethasone (dex) directly
upregulate human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) replication acutely
infected cells potentiate hiv expression chronically infected
promonocytic u1 cells stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). we
have investigated potential effect dex u1 cells stimulated with
interleukin-6 (il-6), cytokine inducing virus expression acting mostly 
post-transcriptional level virus life cycle.
materials methods: virus production culture supernatants evaluated 
reverse transcriptase (rt) activity. gc receptor expression tested both
binding [3h]-dexamethasone 21-mesylate northern blotting. cell-associated 
hiv protein expression analyzed western blotting, whereas hiv and
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) rna accumulation evaluated by
northern blotting. hiv transcription tested long terminal repeat (ltr)
chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) assay transient transfection u1
or u937 cells. formation activating protein-1 (ap-1) dna binding complex in
nuclear cell extracts visualized electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(emsa), whereas erk1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) phosphorylation
was studied western blotting.
results: il-6 dex synergistically induced hiv expression u1 cells, and
this effect blocked ru 486. substantial hiv rna accumulation was
demonstrated u1 cells co-stimulated il-6 dex, whereas il-6
upregulated expression mcp-1 rna, effect inhibited dex. in
contrast, dex potentiated il-6 induced activation ap-1 erk1/2 mapk
phosphorylation, revealed emsa. hiv-1 ltr driven transcription observed
in u1 cells stimulated tnf-alpha effect potentiated dex. 
sharp contrast, induction ltr-directed cat activity observed in
transfected u1 cells (or parental uninfected u937 cells) stimulated with
il-6 dex either alone combination.
conclusions: high levels virion production induced latently infected
cells stimulation il-6 dex absence activation hiv
ltr viral transcription spite activation erk1/2 mapk ap-1.
these findings suggest existence ltr-independent pathways influenced by
cytokine gc hiv maintain substantial levels protein
expression virion production.
