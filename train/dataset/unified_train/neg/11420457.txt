hemophagocytic syndrome (hps) clinicopathologic syndrome reveal a
non-hodgkin's lymphoma. pathologic features lymphoma associated hps
remain ill defined. studied 11 lymphomas associated hps initial bone
marrow biopsies, consecutively diagnosed 6-year period western
institution. seven diffuse large b-cell lymphomas (dlbcls), three
t-cell lymphomas (one peripheral t-cell lymphoma unspecified, two hepatosplenic
gammadelta t-cell lymphomas [hs gammadeltatls]), one aggressive nk-cell
lymphoma/leukemia (nkl). lymphomas shared common clinicopathologic features
with systemic presentation, poor outcome (nine patients died within 2 years),
and mild interstitial lymphoid infiltrate bone marrow presentation in
nine patients. equivocal lymphoma infiltrate blending normal
hematopoietic cells, cd20 cd3 immunolabelings essential its
detection. high number reactive (cd3+) cells, often a
predominant cytotoxic (cd8+ tia1+) phenotype, present dlbcls. in
situ hybridization, epstein-barr virus detected neoplastic cells three 
cases (one dlbcl, one hs gammadeltatl, one nkl), also showed serum
viral dna. polymerase chain reaction studies disclosed hhv6 dna sequences in
tumor tissues two dlbcls, whereas hhv8 dna detected. tumor
mass indicative lymphoma striking patients, bone marrow biopsy
appears great value diagnosis hps-associated lymphoma,
which may be, western patients, b- well t- nk-cell type.
immunostaining cd3 cd20 essential identify common subtle
lymphoma involvement. together better understanding pathogenic
processes, early diagnosis may improve prognosis hps-associated
lymphoma.
