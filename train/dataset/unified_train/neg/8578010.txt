a single-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (srt-pcr) method
was optimized hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna detection. extraction procedures by
proteinase k guanidinium isothiocyanate gave similar results. optimal
mgcl2 concentration srt-pcr method 2 mm 10 units superscript 
m-mlv rnase h-reverse transcriptase 1 unit taq polymerase. shorter pcr
cycling steps gave 10-fold-increased pcr product compared longer cycling
steps. twenty-five anti-hcv-positive sera chronic hepatitis c patients 
positive srt-pcr, whereas 17 25 positive dissociated rt 
and pcr (drt/pcr). specificity assessed twenty negative controls. srt-pcr 
was 5-fold sensitive (5 hcv rna copies per assay) drt/pcr hcv
rna transcript. srt-pcr method hcv rna detection appears fully adapted
for routine use medical virology laboratory.
