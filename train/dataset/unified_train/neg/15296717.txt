drosophila flamingo 7-pass transmembrane cadherin necessary for
dendritic patterning axon guidance. works molecular level and
whether homologs flamingo play similar roles mammalian neurons 
been unanswered questions. here, performed loss-of-function analysis using 
rnai system organotypic brain slice cultures address role a
mammalian flamingo homolog, celsr2. knocking celsr2 resulted prominent
simplification dendritic arbors cortical pyramidal neurons purkinje
neurons, phenotype seemed due branch retraction. cadherin
domain-mediated homophilic interaction appears required maintenance
of dendritic branches. furthermore, expression various celsr2 forms elicited
distinct responses dependent extracellular subregion outside 
cadherin domains portion within carboxyl intracellular tail. based
on findings, discuss celsr2 may regulate dendritic maintenance and
growth.
