rotavirus vaccines (rvv) protect childhood gastroenteritis caused by
rotavirus (rv) decreased effectiveness low- middle-income
settings. proof-of-concept, randomized-controlled, open-label trial tested
if microbiome modulation improve rvv immunogenicity. healthy adults were
randomized administered broad-spectrum (oral vancomycin, ciprofloxacin,
metronidazole), narrow-spectrum (vancomycin), antibiotics then
vaccinated rvv, 21 per group per protocol. baseline anti-rv iga high 
all subjects. although antibiotics alter absolute anti-rv iga titers, rvv
immunogenicity boosted 7 days narrow-spectrum group. further,
antibiotics increased fecal shedding rv also rapidly altering gut
bacterial beta diversity. beta diversity associated rvv immunogenicity
boosting day 7 specific bacterial taxa distinguish rvv boosters and
rv shedders identified. despite negative primary endpoint, study
demonstrates microbiota modification alters immune response rvv and
supports exploration microbiome manipulation improve rvv
immunogenicity.
