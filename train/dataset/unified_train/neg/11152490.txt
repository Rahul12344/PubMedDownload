the virion host shutoff protein (vhs) herpes simplex virus (hsv) triggers
global shutoff host protein synthesis accelerated mrna turnover during
virus infection induces endoribonucleolytic cleavage exogenous rna
substrates produced rabbit reticulocyte (rrl) vitro
translation system. although vhs induces rna turnover absence hsv
gene products, yet known whether cellular factors required 
activity. one approach addressing question, expressed vhs the
budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. expression vhs inhibited colony
formation, severity effect varied carbon source. the
biological relevance effect assessed examining activity of
five mutant forms vhs bearing previously characterized in-frame linker
insertions. results indicated complete concordance growth
inhibition phenotype yeast mammalian host cell shutoff. despite these
results, expression vhs trigger global mrna turnover vivo, cell
extracts yeast expressing vhs displayed little vhs-dependent
endoribonuclease activity. however, activity readily detected such
extracts mixed rrl. data suggest vhs-dependent
endoribonuclease requires one mammalian macromolecular factors for
efficient activity.
