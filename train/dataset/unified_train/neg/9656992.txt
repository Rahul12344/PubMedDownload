the nef gene human simian immunodeficiency viruses hiv siv has
been implicated pathogenicity; however, mechanism nef induces
disease still unknown. impact signal transduction cells been
suggested interaction nef hiv-1 strain tyrosine kinases
like hck lck well serine/threonine kinases. confirmed the
binding hck hiv-1 subtype b nef demonstrated equally strong
interaction subtype e nef protein weaker binding nef hiv-2
subtype (hiv-2d194). binding, however, observed hiv-2 subtype b nef
(hiv-2d205). instead, protein bound novel cellular protein, nefin 1,
with characteristics adaptor protein strong expression human
hematopoietic tissues. nefin 1 binds amino-terminal domain, is
related sh3 domains. interaction nef nefin 1, pxxp motif and
the three-dimensional conformation molecule appear necessary. in
conclusion, study demonstrates nef proteins divergent strains of
hiv-1 hiv-2 may use different elements signal transduction pathways for
the induction pathogenicity vivo.
