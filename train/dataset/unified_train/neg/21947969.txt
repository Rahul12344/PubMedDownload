bovine herpesvirus 1 (bohv-1) infection cattle buffalo makes animals
life-long carriers virus intermittently excreted semen. the
present study, real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) validated to
screen frozen semen cattle buffalo bohv-1 amplification gb
gene virus. analysing intra- inter-test variability, assay was
found highly reproducible. high sensitivity (100%) specificity (90.04%)
of real-time pcr assay recorded comparison virus isolation.
extended frozen semen samples 574 cattle buffalo bulls were
seropositive infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (ibr) tested real-time pcr
indicated 1.97% semen batches cattle 3.36% batches buffalo semen
were positive bohv-1. real-time pcr protocol useful screening
large numbers semen samples ibr-seropositive cattle buffalo bulls 
the test less time consuming several batches semen tested with
ease compared virus isolation cell culture.
