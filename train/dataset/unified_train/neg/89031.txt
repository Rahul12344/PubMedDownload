the immunoglobulin g (igg) fraction antiserum rabbits immunized 
homogeneous beef pancreas tryptophanyl-trna synthetase inhibits enzyme
activity reactions trnatrp aminoacylation tryptophan
activation. fab fragments igg act similar way. common antigenic
determinants detected tryptophanyl-trna synthetases beef, pig, 
chicken rat livers using pure antibodies beef pancreas
tryptophanyl-trna synthetase. observation indicates evolutional
stability certain structural features tryptophanyl-trna synthetases. the
interaction antibodies fragments beef tryptophanyl-trna synthetase
produced endogenous tryptic proteolysis enzyme studied. on
third antiserum antibodies interacting c-terminal fragment the
enzyme (mr approximately equal 40000) inhibits activity whereas the
antibodies n-terminal fragment (mr approximately equal 20000) no
effect enzyme activity. immunochemical identity two synthetase 
fragments differing enzymatic activity supports assumption 
loss enzymatic activity tryptic fragment caused lack small
peptide retained case endogenous proteolysis; probably amino
acid residues peptide participate formation active centre of
tryptophanyl-trna synthetase. radioimmunochemical method described for
determining number antigenic determinants. one molecule of
tryptophanyl-trna synthetase found bind 9 (+/- 1) molecules fab
fragments. antibodies tryptophanyl-trna snythetase beef pancreas 
not inhibit noticeably activity reverse transcriptase avian
myeloblastosis virus. antigenic determinants common detected in
reverse transcriptase tryptophanyl-trna synthetase radioimmunochemical
assays.
