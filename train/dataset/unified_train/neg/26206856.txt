biliary atresia (ba), neonatal obstructive cholangiopathy, remains most
common indication pediatric liver transplantation united states. in
the murine model ba, rhesus rotavirus (rrv) vp4 surface protein determines
biliary duct tropism. study, investigated vp4 governs induction of
murine ba. newborn mice injected 16 strains rotavirus observed
for clinical symptoms ba mortality. cholangiograms performed to
confirm bile duct obstruction. livers bile ducts harvested 7 days
postinfection virus titers histology. flow cytometry assessed mononuclear
cell activation harvested cell populations liver. cytotoxic nk cell
activity determined ability nk cells kill noninfected
cholangiocytes. 16 strains investigated, 6 highest homology
to rrv vp4 (>87%) capable infecting bile ducts vivo. although 
strain ro1845 replicated titer similar rrv vivo, caused symptoms
or mortality. ro1845 reassortant containing rrv vp4 induced ba
symptoms, mortality rate 89%. flow cytometry revealed nk cell
activation significantly increased disease-inducing strains 
nk cells demonstrated significantly higher percentage cytotoxicity against
noninfected cholangiocytes. rotavirus strains >87% homology rrv's vp4
were capable infecting murine bile ducts vivo. development murine ba was
mediated rrv vp4-specific activation mononuclear cells, independent of
viral titers.
