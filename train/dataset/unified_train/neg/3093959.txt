simpson lo, shand bi, olds rj.

the blood rheology edta-anticoagulated blood samples blood donors and
subjects considered myalgic encephalomyelitis assessed multiple
shear rate viscometry multiple-pressure filterability. although average
viscosities two groups different, differences reach
statistical significance. contrast, data multiple-pressure filtration
of whole blood showed significant differences females lowest (2.5 
cm water) filtration pressure. appears acute phase disorder
is associated changes blood rheology could impair microcirculatory 
blood flow. contrast, chronic state appear associated 
rheological abnormalities.
