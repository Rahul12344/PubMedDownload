to better understand requirement interleukin 2 (il-2) specific immune 
responses, established use cell ablation selectively eliminate 
t cells produce il-2. accomplish generated transgenic mice
that express herpes simplex virus 1-thymidine kinase (hsv-tk) gene 
transcriptional control murine il-2 promoter renders il-2-producing
cells sensitive cytotoxic effects antiviral drug ganciclovir
(ganc). hsv-tk activity specifically expressed activated cells from
transgenic mice. cd4 cells transgenic mice stimulated the
superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin (sea) presence ganc,
proliferation il-2 production almost completely inhibited the
activated cd4+v beta 3+ cell population, eliminated. proliferation not
restored adding il-2, showing proliferating cells bystander 
cells. contrast, proliferative response concanavalin (con a) only
partially inhibited treatment cd4 cells ganc, although the
efficiency eliminating il-2-producing cells shown comparable with
that achieved using sea. suggests portion proliferative
response con occurs via alternative pathway requiring il-2 synthesis 
and release.
