herpes zoster causes substantial morbidity, especially among older adults.
although acute cutaneous manifestations painful troublesome, the
most important consequence herpes zoster (shingles) chronic pain
syndrome known postherpetic neuralgia (phn). previous studies suggested
that declining varicella-zoster virus (vzv)-specific cell-mediated immune (cmi)
responses account increased frequency herpes zoster seen older
adults. led idea immunization designed boost vzv-specific cmi
responses might reduce risk herpes zoster. hypothesis tested a
large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial called shingles
prevention study (sps). compared placebo group, herpes zoster vaccine
recipients 61.1% reduction zoster "burden illness" (an index
incorporating incidence severity herpes zoster); 66.5% reduction 
incidence postherpetic neuralgia; 51.3% reduction incidence of
herpes zoster. incidence serious adverse events different 
the overall vaccine placebo populations. frequently encountered
adverse event among vaccine recipients local reactogenicity, with
self-limited generally mild tenderness, warmth, erythema occurring 
injection site one-half vaccine recipients. zoster vaccine was
approved us food drug administration 2006 indicated for
prevention herpes zoster immunocompetent persons aged 60 years and
older.perspective: herpes zoster vaccine provides physicians an
effective means reducing patient's risk developing shingles its
attendant complications. significant safety concerns regarding vaccine
have identified. indications use attenuated-virus vaccine in
special subpopulations continue evolve.
