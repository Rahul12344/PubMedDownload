two attenuated influenza donor viruses, a/udorn/72 ts-1a2 a/ann
arbor/6/60 cold-adapted (ca) viruses, evaluated ability to
reproducibly attenuate new variant influenza virus specific and
desired level transfer one attenuating genes. these
donor viruses able attenuate influenza viruses belonging the
h3n2 subtype transfer one attenuating genes. determine
whether two donor viruses could attenuate wild-type virus belonged
to different influenza subtype, ts-1a2 ca recombinants wild-type
virus representative a/ussr/77 (h1n1) russian influenza strain were
prepared evaluated adult doubly seronegative volunteers several doses. 
the recombinants derived donor viruses attenuated doubly
seronegative adults. less 5% infected vaccinees developed febrile or
systemic reaction, whereas five six recipients wild-type virus developed
such response. 50% human infectious dose (hid(50)) recombinant was
approximately 10(5.0) 50% tissue culture infective doses. virus shed the
ts-1a2 ca vaccinees retained ts ca phenotype, both. occurred
despite replication recombinant viruses 9 days. evidence 
transmission ca ts-1a2 recombinant virus controls observed. a
serum hemagglutination inhibition response detected less 50% the
infected vaccinees. however, sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, serological response detected 100% ca vaccinees given 300 
hid(50) approximately 70% ca ts vaccinees received 10 32 hid(50)
of virus. results indicate recombinants derived donor
viruses satisfactorily attenuated stable genetically after
replication doubly seronegative adults although induced lower serum
hemagglutination inhibition response found previously h3n2 ts and
ca recombinants.
