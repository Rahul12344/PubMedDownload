human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-i) reverse transcriptase expressed e.
coli purified homogeneity (e. coli strain rri (prc-rt, prk 248cits)). we
have investigated substrate properties toward dna synthesis, catalyzed 
this enzyme, nucleoside-5'-triphosphate analogues, previously studied 
the reactions, catalyzed amv m-mlv reverse transcriptases. have
investigated substrate properties new analogues of
2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro- 2',3'-dideoxytubercidin-5'-triphosphates. we
have compared relative efficiency incorporation different analogues
tested dna chain. shown expressed purified hiv
reverse transcriptase specificity analogues of
2'-deoxyribonucleoside-5'-triphosphates described reverse
transcriptases natural hiv reverse transcriptase well. properties
allow apply expressed hiv reverse transcriptase different model
systems.
