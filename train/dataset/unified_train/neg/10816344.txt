background: cancer cells maintained monolayer tissue culture frequently
used study tumor biology nutrient uptake, concern this
system may fully reflect clinical tumor physiology. cells grown 
3-d configuration closely resemble vivo environment, model was
developed characterized growth sk-hep human hepatoma cells in
suspension multicellular tumor spheroids (mts). measurement nutrient
uptake system never established.
materials methods: sk-hep cultures initiated single cell suspensions 
and grown mts siliconized spinner flasks. transport several
individual amino acids (arginine, glutamate, leucine,
alpha-(n-methylamino)isobutyric acid (meaib), glutamine (gln)) measured
in sk-hep single cell suspensions mts (0. 50-0.60 mm diameter) a
radiotracer/rapid filtration technique, regulation glutamine uptake
by phorbol esters. l-[(3)h]gln uptake also measured larger spheroids
(0.85-1.5 mm diameter). mts cellularity evaluated histological
examination, single cell integrity transport assay confirmed by
scanning electron microscopy (sem).
results: sk-hep mts displayed gradients cellular morphology staining, with
central necrosis visible diameters >0.8 mm. single cell suspensions endured
the rapid filtration technique based functional na(+)-dependent uptake rates
and sem analysis. amino acids tested, gln transport rates were
visibly affected growth format. small mts, na(+)-dependent gln uptake was
diminished 40%, 40-53% higher mts >1 mm displaying central
necrosis, compared single cell suspensions. likewise, slight parallel
changes glutamine transporter atb(0) mrna levels observed northern
blot analysis. finally, phorbol ester-dependent gln transport down-regulation (by
40-50%), previously established sk-hep monolayers, remained operative all
cell formats tested.
conclusions: data suggest tumor microenvironment differentially
impacts uptake specific nutrients despite conservation key
regulatory pathways. mts technique may prove useful studies on
the role nutrient transport nascent tumor growth.
