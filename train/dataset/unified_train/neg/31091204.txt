anal squamous cell carcinomas (asccs) frequently harbor human papillomavirus
(hpv), commonly high-risk (hr-) hpv type 16. p16 immunohistochemistry 
(ihc) typically used surrogate hr-hpv status oropharynx and
cervix, overexpression also occur result oncogenic stress and
sometimes prove nonspecific. recent investigations use
of hpv rna situ hybridization (rish) assays alternative method, which
have shown robust results squamous cell carcinomas oropharynx and
cervix. study evaluated hpv rish p16 ihc 50 asccs, well the
clinicopathologic features ascc relative hpv status. found hpv rish
and p16 ihc closely agreement 96% concordance. using 2
methodologies, 78% asccs hr-hpv positive, 10% low-risk hpv positive,
and 12% hpv-negative. none cases showed co-infection across hr-hpv
and low-risk hpv. asccs related hr-hpv likely 
a typical keratinizing morphology (p=0.05) likely involve the
perianal area (p=0.006). hpv-negative cases particularly aggressive with
high rates metastases patient death within 2 years diagnosis. overall, 
hpv rish appears reliable methodology testing, hpv status may
have implications prognostication asccs.
