eighty-seven seropositive subjects hiv (human immunodeficiency virus)
infection together 20 normal controls history illness were
investigated presence circulating immune complexes (cic) the
conglutinin binding assay (kgba) studied isotype characterization
of cic. six 87 patients showing high values immune complexes
(cic) studied presence free antigen. 3 6 (1, ivc1; 1,
iii; 1, iva) could detect ultracentrifugation analysis presence of
specific hiv (p15) anti-hiv (anti-p15) gp41-anti-gp41 cic. evidence favour
of finding supported by: presence specific cic (p15-anti-p15 or
gp41-anti-gp41) seen ph 7.2; apparent presence free antigen and
specific hiv antibodies ph 4.0. relevance finding lies
in attempt explain occurrence false seronegativity seen
occasionally symptomatic patients. thus, presence cic might perhaps
interfere routine assay (i.e. elisa) making diagnosis difficult. all
these considerations taken account future handling of
this disease.
