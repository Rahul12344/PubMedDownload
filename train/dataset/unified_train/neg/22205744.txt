orthopoxviruses include prototypical vaccinia virus, emerging infectious 
agent monkeypox virus, potential biothreat variola virus (the causative
agent smallpox). currently fda-approved drug humans infected
with orthopoxviruses. screened diversity-oriented synthesis library new 
scaffolds activity vaccinia virus. screen identified a
nonnucleoside analog blocked postreplicative intermediate late gene
expression. viral genome replication unaffected, inhibition could be
elicited late infection persisted upon drug removal. sequencing of
drug-resistant viruses revealed mutations predicted periphery the
highly conserved viral rna polymerase large subunit. consistent this, the
compound broad-spectrum activity orthopoxviruses vitro. these
findings indicate novel chemical synthesis approaches potential source
for new infectious disease therapeutics identify potentially promising
candidate development treat orthopoxvirus-infected individuals.
