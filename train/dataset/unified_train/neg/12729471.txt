the etiology graves' disease multifactorial. investigated role of
genetic environmental factors susceptibility graves'
hyperthyroidism using new murine model. intramuscular injection recombinant 
adenovirus expressing thyrotropin receptor (adcmvtshr) induces graves'-like
hyperthyroidism (thyrotropin receptor [tshr] antibodies, elevated thyroxine, 
diffuse goiter) 50% female balb/c mice. relative
contributions major histocompatibility complex (mhc) non-mhc genes 
susceptibility hyperthyroidism studied immunizing balb/c (h-2d),
balb.k (h-2k), dba/2j (h-2d) mice adcmvtshr. hyperthyroidism developed
in approximately 50% balb/c balb.k mice 5% dba/2j mice,
indicating major role non-mhc genes disease development. effect of
environmental microorganisms evaluated comparing disease incidence in
balb/c mice maintained pathogen-free conditions versus nonsterile,
conventional housing, well coadministering microorganism components
(escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide yeast zymosan a) adjuvants with
adcmvtshr. neither type exposure environmental pathogens influenced disease
induction. conclusion, non-mhc genes, infectious organisms, play a
major role etiology novel murine model graves' disease.
