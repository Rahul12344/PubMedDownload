hla b8-restricted cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctl) specific influenza virus
were generated shown recognize nucleoprotein (np). dominant
epitope mapped using recombinant vaccinia viruses expressed fragments of
the np synthetic peptides based np amino acid sequence. the
peptide 380-393 first identified refined; shown the
glutamic acid position 380 essential recognition ctl the
nonamer 380-388 optimum peptide. six hla b8-positive influenza immune
donors tested respond peptide part their
influenza-specific ctl response. amino acid sequence peptide epitope
was compared six known virus peptides known restricted hla b8
and sequence homology identified, predicted nonamer octamer
epitope sequences. probable anchor residues identified peptide residues 3
(lysine/arginine), 5 (lysine/arginine) 9 (leucine/isoleucine). support for
this pattern came sequencing peptides eluted purified hla b8 molecules,
where lysines predominant positions 3 5. one predicted epitope
peptides made shown recognized specific ctl. two
others shown compete np 380-388 binding hla b8. model was
made hla b8 molecule negatively charged pockets predicted, could
accommodate positively charged side chains peptide anchor residues.
