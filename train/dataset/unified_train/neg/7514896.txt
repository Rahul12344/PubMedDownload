human antibodies generated epstein-barr virus (ebv) immortalization b 
cells derived tumor draining lymph nodes cancer patients. antibodies were
screened reactivity elisa synthetic peptide corresponding the
protein core polymorphic epithelial mucin (pem). epitopes within this
region fact considered tumor specific since selectively
exposed tumor cells due aberrant glycosylation. human antibodies thus
selected react elisa immunohistochemistry pem-expressing tumor cells.
this first demonstration existence b cell immune response
against selected epitopes pem and, association cytotoxic cell
(ctl) response already demonstrated, represents basis use of
synthetic peptides vaccines cancer patients.
