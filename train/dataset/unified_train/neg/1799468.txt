this paper aims summarize current experience alpha interferon provide
direction future study. four areas alpha interferon has
proven potential activity: antiviral, premalignant, adjuvant advanced
disease settings. three main viral diseases interferon alfa-2b has
been shown activity chronic viral hepatitis, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome, human papilloma virus infections. vitro studies
suggest alpha interferon may inhibit transformation premalignant
conditions malignant disease; e.g., vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia. in
the adjuvant setting, possible biological response modifier, as
alpha interferon, may role helping immune system destroy
residual tumour cells following tumour bulk reduction radiation or
chemotherapy. higher response rate seen patients small tumour 
bulk compared large tumour bulk (e.g., malignant melanoma, ovarian 
carcinoma), patients early, rather late, disease (e.g., chronic 
myelogenous leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, multiple myeloma, non-hodgkin's
lymphoma). may due efficacy small tumour bulk setting due to
an immunoadjuvant role. advanced disease, question best exploit 
the possible synergistic effects alpha interferon therapeutic
modalities. optimum dose, schedule patient populations combined
treatment yet determined. major objective paper to
determine best capitalize upon current state knowledge build for
future trials alpha interferon, determine whether existing data
suggest adjuvant role interferon initial tumour regression.
