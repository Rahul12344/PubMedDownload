non-structural (ns) proteins dengue virus (denv) important viral
replication. four membrane proteins coded viral genome.
ns2b shown one membrane proteins main function was
confirmed regulate viral protease activity. membrane topology still not
known studies conducted understand structure.
here report determination membrane topology ns2b denv serotype 
4 using nmr spectroscopy. ns2b denv4 expressed purified detergent
micelles. secondary structure ns2b first defined based backbone
chemical resonance assignment. four helices identified ns2b. membrane
topology ns2b defined based relaxation analysis paramagnetic
relaxation enhancement experiments. last three helices shown 
stable first helix. ns3 protease cofactor region α2 α3
is highly dynamic. results useful structural and
functional analysis ns2b.
