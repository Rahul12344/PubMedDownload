sendai virus-infected nude mouse sera obtained seventh day infection
or later, anti-sendai virus antibodies undetectable by
hemagglutination-inhibition neutralization tests, found reactive
with virus antigen elisa using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse igg rabbit igg. reactivity blocked rabbit anti-sendai virus
antiserum observed influenza virus served control 
antigen. anti-sendai virus antibody activity fractions sephadex g-200 gel
filtration detected igm fraction anti-mouse mu chain-specific
antiserum used igg igm fractions heavy light
chain-specific anti-mouse igg serum employed elisa. elisa fractions
from protein a-sepharose affinity chromatography sendai virus-infected nude
mouse sera showed eluates ph 6.0 ph 3.5 contained igg1 igg2b 
anti-sendai virus anti-bodies, respectively, eluate ph 4.5
contained igg2a igg3 antibodies.
