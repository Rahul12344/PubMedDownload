the beta-1,6-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (beta1,6gnt) gene family encodes
enzymes playing crucial roles glycan synthesis. important changes in
beta1,6gnt expression observed development, oncogenesis, and
immunodeficiency. characterized beta1,6gnts gene family 
human (h) c2gnt-l h-ignt, core 2
[galbeta1-->3(glcnacbeta1-->6)galnac] branching
[glcnacbeta1-->3(glcnacbeta1-->6)gal] activities, respectively. recently,
h-c2gnt-m shown unique forming core 2, core 4
[glcnacbeta1-->3(glcnacbeta1-->6)galnac], structures. date, the
beta1,6gnt gene family characterized mammals. here, describe 
that bovine herpesvirus type 4 (bhv-4) encodes beta1,6gnt expressed during
viral replication exhibiting core 2, core 4, branching
activities. sequencing bhv-4 genome revealed orf, hereafter called
borff3-4, encoding protein (pborff3-4) exhibiting 81.1%, 50.7%, 36.6% amino
acid identity h-c2gnt-m, h-c2gnt-l, h-ignt, respectively. reverse
transcriptase-pcr analysis revealed borff3-4 expressed bhv-4
replication. expression borff3-4 chinese hamster ovary cells directed the
expression core 2 branched oligosaccharides antigenic structures 
cell surface. moreover, soluble form pborff3-4 core 4 branching activity
in addition core 2 branching activities. finally, infection a
c2gnt-negative cell line bhv-4 induced expression core 2 branched
oligosaccharides. study extends beta1,6gnt gene family viral gene
and provides model study biological functions beta1,6gnt the
context viral infection.
