background: dendritic cells (dcs) professional antigen-presenting cells 
play important roles human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1)
infection. hiv-1 derived lentiviral vectors (lvs) transduce dcs high
efficiency effects dc functions carefully studied.
modification dcs using lvs may lead important applications in
transplantation, treatment cancer, autoimmune infectious diseases.
results: using dcs prepared multiple blood donors, report lv
transduction dcs resulted altered dc phenotypes functions. lentiviral
transduction dcs resulted down-regulation cell surface molecules
including cd1a, co-stimulatory molecules cd80, cd86, icam-1, dc-sign. dcs
transduced lvs displayed diminished capacity polarize naive cells 
differentiate th1 effectors. impaired th1 response could fully
corrected co-transduction dcs lvs encoding interleukin-12 (il-12),
interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma), small interfering rna (sirna) targeting il-10.
conclusions: dcs transduced lvs vitro displayed diminished th1 functions 
due altered dc phenotypes. study addresses important issue concerning
lentiviral infection modification dc functions, provides rational
approach using lvs immunotherapy.
