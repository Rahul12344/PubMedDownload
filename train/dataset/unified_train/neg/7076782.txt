some factors affecting formation precipitin lines during
immunoosmophoresis investigated using two unrelated insect riboviruses,
flock house virus (fhv) cricket paralysis virus (crpv). precipitin lines
formed 90 min. concentrations 200-400 ng/ml fhv routinely
detected occasionally end-point low 50 ng/ml. crpv, 1500
ng/ml routine detectable level. sensitivity assay largely 
unaffected presence insect homogenate. maximum detection virus was
obtained antigens antibodies optimal proportion excess
of either reagent resulted blurring precipitin lines.
immunoosmophoresis proved rapid inexpensive method detecting
negatively charged viruses crude insect extracts can, cases, 
a sensitivity approaching sophisticated serological techniques.
