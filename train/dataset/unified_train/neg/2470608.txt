we developed immortalized epithelial cystic fibrosis (cf) cell lines by
infecting cultured nasal polyp cells sv40/adenol2 hybrid virus. cell
lines obtained epithelial nature shown cytokeratin production and
morphology, although cytokeratins 4 13 typical primary nasal polyp cells
are produced much reduced rate. ussing chamber experiments showed the
precrisis cf cell line ncf3 able perform trans-cellular chloride transport
when activated agents elevate intracellular calcium. camp agonists had
no effect chloride flux ncf3 expected cf cells. apical chloride 
channels found patch clamp technique ncf3 postcrisis cell 
line ncf3a conductance similar chloride channels found earlier 
in normal cf epithelial cells. channels show delay onset of
activity off-cell patches activated increased camp levels in
the cell. indicates immortalized cf epithelial cells provide a
useful model study cystic fibrosis.
