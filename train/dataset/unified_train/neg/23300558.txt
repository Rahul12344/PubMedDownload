background: infections hiv still represent major human health problem
worldwide vaccine long-term option fight efficiently against
this virus. standardized assessments hiv-specific immune responses vaccine 
trials essential prioritizing vaccine candidates preclinical and
clinical stages development. respect neutralizing antibodies, assays
with hiv-1 env-pseudotyped viruses high priority. cover increasing
demands hiv pseudoviruses, complete cell culture transfection automation
system developed.
methodology/principal findings: automation system hiv pseudovirus
production comprises modified tecan-based cellerity system. covers area
of 5Ã—3 meters includes robot platform, cell counting machine, co(2)
incubator cell cultivation media refrigerator. processes cell
handling, transfection pseudovirus production implemented according
to manual standard operating procedures controlled scheduled
autonomously system. system housed biosafety level ii cabinet 
that guarantees protection personnel, environment product. hiv
pseudovirus stocks scale 140 ml 1000 ml produced the
automated system. parallel manual production hiv pseudoviruses comparisons
(bridging assays) confirmed automated produced pseudoviruses of
equivalent quality produced manually. addition, automated method 
was fully validated according good clinical laboratory practice (gclp)
guidelines, including validation parameters accuracy, precision, robustness
and specificity.
conclusions: automated hiv pseudovirus production system successfully
established. allows high quality production hiv pseudoviruses under
gclp conditions. present form, installed module enables production
of 1000 ml virus-containing cell culture supernatant per week. thus, this
novel automation facilitates standardized large-scale productions hiv
pseudoviruses ongoing upcoming hiv vaccine trials.
