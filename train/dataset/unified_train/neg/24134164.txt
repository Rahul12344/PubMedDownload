the use alcohol associated increased risk acquisition
of hiv-1 infection increased rate disease progression among those
already infected virus. potential alcohol exacerbate the
effects hiv infection especially important central nervous system
(cns) area vulnerable combined effects alcohol hiv 
infection. effects alcohol glial cells mediated receptors
such toll-like receptor 4 n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. causes the
activation signaling molecules interleukin-1 receptor-associated
kinase various members p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family and
subsequent activation transcription factors nuclear factor-kappa beta 
and activator protein 1. eventual outcome increase pro-inflammatory 
cytokine production glial cells. alcohol also induces higher levels nadph
oxidase glial cells, leads increased production reactive oxygen
species (ros). viral invasion cns occurs early infection, hiv
proteins also demonstrated increase levels pro-inflammatory
cytokines ros glial cells activation pathways 
activated alcohol. cell culture systems animal models have
demonstrated concomitant exposure alcohol hiv/hiv proteins results in
increased levels expression pro-inflammatory cytokines as
interleukin-1 beta tumor necrosis factor-alpha, along increased levels
of oxidative stress. clinical studies also suggest alcohol exacerbates the
cns effects hiv-1 infection. review focuses mechanisms which
alcohol causes increased cns damage hiv-1 infection.
