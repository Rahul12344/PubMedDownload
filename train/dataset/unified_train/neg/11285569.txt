ebv serological tests used many years accessory diagnostic
predictors nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc). increase sensitivity and
specificity npc detection rate, novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(elisa) established using bacterially-expressed gst-ebna-1 protein,
containing ebna-1 sequence cloned npc patient. serum samples were
collected age- gender-matched patients npc, community control
subjects hospital control patients tested using elisa. the
positivity rates 78.7% (247/314) npc, 11.5% (28/244) hospital controls
and 3.8% (10/263) community control group. serum samples also
tested iga anti-vca antibodies ability neutralize ebv dnase 
the sensitivities anti-vca antibody dnase-neutralization tests also
were analyzed. optimum combination vca plus ebna-1, identify
92.5% (287/310) npc patients, shows specificity 92.7% (242/261) for
normal individuals.
