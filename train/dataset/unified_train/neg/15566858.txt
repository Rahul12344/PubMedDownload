background: diagnosis gastrointestinal infections caused small round
structured viruses (srsv) relied upon electron microscopy and
antigen/antibody assays based norwalk virus. investigated cases of
gastroenteritis associated srsvs employing new sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (elisa) using hyperimmune animal anti-sera against
recombinant mexico virus capsid protein (rmxv).
study design: one hundred thirty-five specimens 86 episodes of
gastroenteritis associated srsvs, collected uk october 1993
and september 1994, tested rmxv assay.
results: forty-seven (35%) specimens 35 86 (41%) episodes positive
in rmxv elisa could divided high low reactors. 
sequencing 266-base region rna polymerase gene revealed strains 
highly reactive rmxv assay demonstrated high degree similarity mxv
(97-99% nucleotide level), whereas low-reactive strains consist of
mexico-like strains heterogeneous group viruses exhibiting 70-75%
similarity mxv.
conclusion: results indicate rmxv elisa predominantly type
specific assay, although cross reactivity genogroup 2 srsvs was
observed. mxv responsible 26% srsv-associated gastrointestinal
infections investigated uk one year's surveillance.
