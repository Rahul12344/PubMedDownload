background: epinotia aporema (lepidoptera: tortricidae) important pest of
legume crops south america. epinotia aporema granulovirus (epapgv) a
baculovirus causes polyorganotropic infection host larva. high 
pathogenicity host specificity make epapgv excellent candidate used 
as biological control agent.
results: genome epinotia aporema granulovirus (epapgv) sequenced and
analyzed. circular double-stranded dna genome 119,082 bp length and
codes 133 putative genes. contains 31 baculovirus core genes set
of 19 genes gv exclusive. seventeen orfs unique epapgv in
comparison baculoviruses. these, 16 found homologues genbank,
and one encoded thymidylate kinase. analysis nucleotide sequence repeats
revealed presence 16 homologous regions (hrs) interspersed throughout 
genome. hr characterized presence 1 3 clustered imperfect
palindromes similar previously described palindromes of
tortricid-specific gvs. also, one hrs (hr4) flanking sequences
suggestive putative non-hr ori. interestingly, two complex hrs were
found opposite loci, dividing circular dsdna genome two halves. gene
synteny maps showed great colinearity sequenced gvs, epapgv most
dissimilar 20 kb-long gene block inversion. phylogenetic study
performed 31 core genes 58 baculoviral genomes suggests epapgv is
the baculovirus isolate closest putative common ancestor tortricid
specific betabaculoviruses.
conclusions: study, along previous characterization epapgv
infection, useful better understanding pathology caused this
virus potential utilization bioinsecticide.
