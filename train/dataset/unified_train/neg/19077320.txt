the i5l gene one approximately 90 genes conserved throughout the
chordopoxvirus family, hence presumed play vital roles poxvirus
life cycle. previous work indicated vp13 protein, component the
virion membrane, encoded i5l gene, additional studies 
reported. using recombinant virus encodes i5 protein fused v5
epitope tag endogenous locus (vi5v5), show i5 protein 
expressed post-replicative gene approximately 9 kda protein
does appear phosphorylated vivo. i5 appear traffic to
any cellular organelle, ultrastructural biochemical analyses indicate
that i5 associated membranous components assembling mature
virions. intact virions labeled anti-v5 antibody assessed by
immunoelectron microscopy, indicating c' terminus protein is
exposed virion surface. using recombinant virus encodes a
tet-regulated copy i5v5 gene (vdeltaindi5v5), one i5 locus
has deleted (vdeltai5), also show i5 dispensable replication 
in tissue culture. neither plaque size viral yield produced bsc40
cells primary human fibroblasts affected absence i5 expression.
