transrenal dna (tr-dna) recently discovered class extracellular urinary
dna originates cells dying throughout body. postapoptotic dna is
known appear circulating plasma, recognized a
portion fragments cross kidney barrier appear urine the
form 150-200-bp fragments. tr-dna containing fetal sequences isolated
from urine pregnant women, tumor-specific mutations detected 
tr-dna patients colon pancreatic tumors, donor dna been
found tr-dna isolated recipient urine. furthermore, proviral hiv dna,
bacterial parasite dna sequences detected tr-dna infected
patients. potential applications tr-dna-based tests cover broad area of
molecular diagnostics genetic testing, including prenatal detection of
inherited diseases, tumor diagnostics therapeutic monitoring detection of
infectious agents. tr-dna test expected utility treatment
monitoring, transplantation monitoring, drug development broad public health 
screening, noninvasive, common-platform diagnostic technology has
particular value. review describes highlights tr-dna
technology applications, advantages existing technologies potential
problems anticipated test development.
