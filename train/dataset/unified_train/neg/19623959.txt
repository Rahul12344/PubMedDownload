objective: purified avian influenza virus (aiv) hemagglutinin (ha) gene fragment 
was inserted green fluorescent protein (gfp) expression vector, pegfp-c1.
the role signal peptide ha-gfp expression 293t cells was
investigated cutting signal peptide placing different locations
of ha-gfp fusion gene.
methods: expression gfp 293t cells examined directly with
fluorescence microscope flow cytometry analysis.
results: transfected pegfp-c1, m1, m2 m3 plasmid, under
fluorescent microscope ha-gfp fusion protein successfully expressed.
fluorescence seen homogeneously distributed entire cell body the
cells transfected empty vector pegfp-c1, whereas signal peptide could
obviously reduced expression gfp-ha compared recombinant plasmid
without signal peptide. addition, found significant
effect location signal peptide expression ha-gfp fusion
protein.
