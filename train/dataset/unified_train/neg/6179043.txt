construction expression vivo internally deleted mouse
alpha-fetoprotein gene: presence transcribed alu-like repeat within the
first intervening sequence.

young pr, scott rw, hamer dh, tilghman sm.

an alpha-fetoprotein (afp) 'minigene' constructed joining first two
exons along 0.9 kilobases 5' flanking sequence mouse afp gene to
its last exon 0.4 kilobases 3' flanking sequence. 'minigene' was
tested activity inserting sv40 vector infecting african
green monkey kidney cells. correct initiation, termination, polyadenylation and
splicing observed. furthermore 220 nucleotide transcript detected 
mapped mouse alu-like b1 repeat opposite strand encoding
the afp gene first intervening sequence.
