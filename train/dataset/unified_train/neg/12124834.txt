background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection heterogeneous disease, the
natural history remains controversial. solid evidence that
chronic hcv infection responsible occurrence hepatocellular
carcinoma (hcc). aim current cohort study determine rate of
the development hcc time primary hcv infection assess the
risk factors development hcc chronic posttransfusion hepatitis c
patients.
methods: four hundred sixty-nine patients clinically compensated hcv, who
had undergone single blood transfusion comprised current study cohort.
patients risk factors chronic liver disease excluded. all
patients referred liver center national nagasaki medical
center december 1980 december 1998 followed prospectively
until end analysis (june 2000).
results: follow-up data obtained 445 patients. mean duration from
hcv infection end observation 28 years. fifty-two patients
(11.1%) progressed hcc. mean duration time blood transfusion
to diagnosis hcc 31 years. multivariate cox regression analyses
revealed age, fibrosis, duration hcv infection study entry, alcohol
consumption independent factors affecting development hcc. the
risk developing hcc patients age > = 56 years increased 7.8-fold
compared patients age < 56 years. mean age patients the
time hcc diagnosis 65 years (range, 58-79 years).
conclusions: time diagnosis, 92% 52 hcc patients age > 60
years 38 hcc patients (73%) 60s. a
significantly negative correlation duration hcv infection the
development hcc age patient time infection
(correlation coefficient = 0.702; p < 0.0001; = 61.1-0.82x), indicating that
the age patients, rather duration hcv infection, more
significant hcc development patients posttransfusion hcv. moreover,
these data may contribute design optimal follow-up schedule for
patients posttransfusion hcv.
