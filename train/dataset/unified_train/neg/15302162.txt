2g12 one cloned antibodies broadly neutralizing specificity
to hiv-1 envelope proteins. crystallographic electron microscopic (em) data
showed fab arms locked together via novel vh domain exchange. both
the conventional unprecedented additional vh-vh antigen binding sites
show specificity high mannose oligosaccharides silent face gp120.
we extended em biochemical analysis 2g12. unligated 2g12 igg1
molecules clearly show paired (parallel attached) fab arms "doughnut"
configuration attached fc individual computationally averaged 
images. minority igg molecules 2g12 prep showed open "y"
configuration conventional igg. averaged em image compares well the
atomic structure model 2g12. papain digests 2g12 yielded paired fab arms
(fab dimer), observed em, dissociated fab-sized fragments in
non-reducing sds-page. purified 2g12 reduced alkylated h l chains can
reassociate form igg molecules fab dimer configuration can
combine l h chains conventional human igg form hybrid molecules.
2g12 heavily aggregated following brief acid exposure possibly result 
its unique structure. model aggregation process proposed. anti-id 
mab shown em react neither conventional additional antigen
binding sites, bound lateral faces fab arms intact, reduced 
and alkylated, reconstructed 2g12 molecules. efforts identify igg
molecules similar intertwined fab dimer structure large igg pool were
unsuccessful.
