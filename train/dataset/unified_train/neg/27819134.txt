to report rare case fungal spondylodiscitis patient recovered h7n9
virus infection perform literature review different characteristics 
of candida aspergillus spondylodiscitis, reviewed cases of
spondylodiscitis caused candida aspergillus species. data, including
patients' information, pathogenic species, treatment strategy, outcomes, and
relapses, collected summarized. characteristics candida and
aspergillus spondylodiscitis compared see differences clinical 
features, management, consequences could detected. subject case 
study first misdiagnosed vertebral tumor, then, following
open biopsy, diagnosed fungal spondylodiscitis. patient made 
good recovery following radical debridement. seventy-seven additional cases of
candida spondylodiscitis 94 cases aspergillus spondylodiscitis were
identified literature. patients candida spondylodiscitis tended to
have better outcome patients aspergillus spondylodiscitis (cure rate 
92.3% vs. 70.2%). candida found frequently (47.8%) aspergillus
(26.7%) blood cultures, neurological deficits observed often
in patients aspergillus spondylodiscitis (43.6% vs. 25.6%). candida spinal
infections often treated radical debridement (60.5% vs. 39.6%).
patients candida spondylodiscitis better outcomes, may be
associated prompt recognition, radical surgical debridement, azoles
therapy. good outcome expected fungal spondylodiscitis with
