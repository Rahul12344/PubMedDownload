the clinicopathological range aids-related non-hodgkin lymphomas (nhls)
includes systemic lymphomas, primary central-nervous-system lymphomas, primary
effusion lymphoma, plasmablastic lymphoma oral cavity. most
aids-related nhls belong one three categories high-grade b-cell
lymphomas: burkitt's lymphoma, centroblastic lymphoma, immunoblastic
lymphoma. pathological heterogeneity aids-related nhl reflects the
heterogeneity associated molecular lesions. aids-related burkitt's
lymphoma, molecular lesions involve activation c-myc, inactivation p53,
and infection epstein-barr virus (ebv). aids-related immunoblastic lymphomas
infected ebv characterised frequent expression latent membrane
protein 1-an ebv oncoprotein. biological heterogeneity aids-related nhls
is highlighted histogenetic differences; aids-related nhls related
to distinct b-cell subgroups (eg, germinal-centre post-germinal-centre b
cells). phenotypic pattern aids-related burkitt's lymphomas systemic
aids-related centroblastic lymphomas closely reflects b cells germinal
centres. conversely, phenotype aids-related immunoblastic lymphomas and
aids-related primary effusion lymphomas reflects post-germinal-centre b cells 
all cases. despite clinicopathological, genetic, phenotypic
heterogeneity, lymphomas patients aids carry somatic mutations of
immunoglobulin bcl-6 genes. however, somatic hypermutation mechanism
functions aberrantly significant proportion aids-related nhls, causing
the mutation many genes, possibly favouring chromosomal translocation,
which may powerful contributor malignant transformation. new molecular
and virological evidence pathways greater knowledge other
biological features aids-related nhls may lead new targets for
pathogenetically biologically oriented therapies.
