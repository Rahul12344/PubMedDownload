in gene therapy, retrovirus adenovirus vectors extensively used as
gene-delivery vehicles large-scale processing viral vectors 
will increasingly important. study examined stationary microcarrier
cell culture systems respect production retrovirus vector
(encoding monounit hammerhead ribozyme gene intron) adenovirus
vector (encoding reporter lacz gene). cytodex 1 cytodex 3 solid
microcarriers found able provide good cell growth high-titer
vector production suspension cultures. porous microcarriers cytopore 2
gave slightly lower still efficient growth produced significantly lower
titers retrovirus adenovirus vector producer cells. specific 
retrovirus production proportionally related specific growth rate 
of producer cells. high moi infection essential high-titer production
of adenovirus vector 293 cells. hydrodynamic shear forces on
microcarrier-grown cells increased production yield retrovirus vector but
decreased adenovirus vector. cellular productivity much more
efficient adenovirus vector produced 293 cells compared the
retrovirus vector produced pa317-rcm1 cells. findings provide
further insight feasibility applying microcarrier cell culture
technology produce gene-therapy virus vectors.
