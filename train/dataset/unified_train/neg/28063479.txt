porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) infection one of
the important swine pathogens, causes major economic impact worldwide.
recently, new variant type 2 prrsv, highly pathogenic prrsv (hp-prrsv) has
emerged continued circulate southeast asia region. currently,
commercially available prrsv vaccines, modified live prrs vaccines (mlv) 
able provide complete protection hp-prrsv reported induce 
negative immunomodulatory effects. interestingly, novel dna vaccine was
developed successfully used improve prrsv-specific immune responses
following mlv vaccination. investigate efficacy heterologous dna-mlv 
prime-boost immunization hp-prrsv infection, experimental
vaccinated-challenged study conducted. two-week-old, prrsv-seronegative,
crossbred pigs (5-8 pigs/group) allocated 5 groups. day -14 (d-14), 
the treatment group (dna-mlv) immunized dna vaccine encoding
prrsv-truncated nucleocapsid protein (porf7t), followed commercial modified 
live type 2 prrs vaccine (mlv) d0. groups included group that
received pbs d-14 followed mlv d0 (mlv), porf7t d-14 (dna), pbs d0
(pbs) negative control group. d42, groups, except negative
control group, challenged hp-prrsv (strain 10pl1). results
demonstrated pigs received mlv, regardless dna priming,
exhibited less clinical signs faster viral clearance. following hp-prrsv
challenge, dna-mlv group exhibited improved prrsv-specific immunity, as
observed increased neutralizing antibody titers prrsv-specific ifn-γ
production, reduced il-10 prrsv-specific treg productions. however,
neither prime-boost immunization mlv able induce complete
clinical protection hp-prrsv infection. conclusion, improved
immunological responses, clinical protection, achieved dna-mlv
prime-boost immunization. study highlights potential use heterologous
prime-boost vaccination regimen, dna incorporated vaccine
candidates, improving anti-prrsv immunity may eventually lead induction 
of complete prrsv protection.
