background: unclear whether use contemporary protease inhibitors pose 
similar risk chronic kidney disease (ckd) use older protease inhibitors.
methods: participants data collection adverse events anti-hiv drugs 
(d:a:d) study followed earliest occurrence ckd, last
visit plus 6 months, 1 february 2016. adjusted poisson regression used 
assess associations ckd use ritonavir-boosted atazanavir
(atv/r) ritonavir-boosted darunavir (drv/r).
results: incidence ckd (10.0/1000 person-years follow-up; 95%
confidence interval, 9.5-10.4/1000 person-years follow-up) increased gradually
with increasing exposure atv/r, relation less clear drv/r.
after adjustment, exposure atv/r (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.4; 95%
confidence interval, 1.2-1.6), exposure drv/r (1.0; .8-1.3), remained 
significantly associated ckd.
conclusion: drv/r use significantly associated ckd an
increasing incidence longer atv/r use confirmed.
