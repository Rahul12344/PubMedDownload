greece repeated 25 consecutive weeks, combined data h1n1
virologic surveillance estimate incidence clinical attack rate
(car) influenza a(h1n1). alternative definitions ili (cough sore throat 
and fever>38°c [ili-38] fever 37.1-38°c [ili-37]) used estimate the
number symptomatic infections. infection attack rate (iar) was
approximated using estimates published studies frequency fever 
infected individuals. data h1n1 morbidity mortality used estimate 
icu admission case fatality (cfr) rates. epidemic peaked week 48/2009 
with approximately 750-1,500 new cases/100,000 population per week, depending 
ili-38 ili-37 case definition, respectively. week 6/2010, 7.1%-15.6% the
population greece estimated symptomatically infected h1n1.
children 5-19 years represented affected population group (car:27%-54%),
whereas individuals older 64 years least affected (car:0.6%-2.2%). 
the iar (95% ci) influenza a(h1n1) estimated 19.7% (13.3%, 26.1%).
per 1,000 symptomatic cases, based ili-38 case definition, 416 attended health
services, 108 visited hospital emergency departments 15 admitted to
hospitals. icu admission rate cfr 37 17.5 per 100,000 symptomatic

conclusions/significance: influenza a(h1n1) infected one fifth caused
symptomatic infection 15% greek population. although individuals 
older 65 years least affected age group terms attack rate,
they 55 185 times higher risk icu admission cfr, respectively.
