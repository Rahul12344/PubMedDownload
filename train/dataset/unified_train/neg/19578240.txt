background: hiv type-1 (hiv-1) shown frequently transmitted by
acutely infected patients. investigated relationship dynamics 
of hiv-1 transmission within recently infected patients, hiv-1 variability
and transmission antiretroviral drug resistance.
methods: included patients infected 1996 2006, plasma
sample obtained <18 months seroconversion prior antiretroviral
therapy initiation. reverse transcriptase (rt) protease sequences were
determined direct population sequencing plasma samples. genotypic
resistance interpreted agence nationale de recherches sur le sida et
les hépatites virales 2006 algorithm international aids society-usa list.
phylogenetic analysis (neighbour-joining maximum likelihood methods) rt
sequences used determine hiv-1 subtype interrelationship
between sequences.
results: genotypic resistance detected 37/263 (14.1%) patients. patients
were infected hiv-1 clade b 222 (84%) cases non-b subtypes 41
(16%). total 80 (30.4%) rt sequences segregated 24 clusters with
bootstrap values >98% 22 clusters. frequency grouping clusters 
higher within b sequences compared non-b sequences (35.1% versus 4.9%;
p<2.10(-4)). drug-resistant isolates retrieved 3 clusters, the
prevalence resistance clustering viruses (10/80, 12.5%) different
than isolated sequences.
conclusions: segregation clusters suggested frequent forward
transmission events patients infected hiv-1 subtype b, including the
possibility transmission drug-resistant isolates. findings warrant
increasing prevention efforts serological screening at-risk
populations.
