mouse cytomegalovirus (mcmv), beta-herpesvirus establishes latent and
persistent infections mice, valuable model studying complex
virus-host interactions. mcmv encodes m145 family putative immunoevasins
with predicted major histocompatibility complex, class (mhc-i) structure.
functions attributed family members include down-regulation host mhc-i
(m152) nkg2d ligands (m145, m152, m155) interaction inhibitory
or activating nk receptors (m157). present cellular, biochemical, and
structural characterization m153, heavily glycosylated homodimer,
that require beta2m peptide expressed surface of
mcmv-infected cells. 2.4-a crystal structure confirms compact
molecule preserves mhc-i-like fold reveals novel mode dimerization,
confirmed site-directed mutagenesis, distinctive disulfide-stabilized
extended n terminus. structure provides useful framework comparative
analysis divergent members m145 family.
