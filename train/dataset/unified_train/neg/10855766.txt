herpes simplex virus (hsv) frequently shed infection genital or
perianal area. hsv shedding, determined culture, occurs 3% days
for immunocompetent women men, persons hiv infection 
measured polymerase chain reaction (pcr). horizontal vertical
transmission hsv occurs unrecognized asymptomatic shedding, 
majority hsv-2-infected persons unaware infection. many persons
with 'asymptomatic' hsv-2 infection learn recognize genital signs and
symptoms recurrences hsv-2 infection. however, shedding episodes
remain truly asymptomatic even patient education. antiviral therapy
dramatically reduces asymptomatic shedding, trials evaluate effect 
hsv transmission underway.
