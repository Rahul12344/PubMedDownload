fowl adenovirus-4 (fadv-4) causes hydropericardium syndrome (hps) poultry
worldwide. understanding viral structural protein composition important 
for developing novel immunodiagnostics immunoprophylactics. report
isolation, culture, molecular protein profile fadv-4 isolates recovered
from hps outbreaks chicken states himachal pradesh tamil nadu in
india. performed sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(sds-page) western blotting-based protein profiling fadv-4 isolates
against reference fadv-1 chicken embryo lethal orphan (celo) virus. sds-page
analysis showed seven protein bands fadv-4 isolates similar celo 
expect additional band 110 kda celo virus. western blotting, two
protein fractions 43 kda 78 kda size observed fadv-4 isolates.
overall, results show fadv-4 isolates recovered different regions of
the country similar protein profile possibly common source origin.
