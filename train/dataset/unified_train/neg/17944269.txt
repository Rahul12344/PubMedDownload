highly pathogenic h5n1 influenza viruses become endemic poultry
populations throughout southeast asia continue infect humans a
greater 50% case fatality rate. far, human-to-human transmission these
viruses limited. here, discuss molecular features h5n1
influenza viruses might affect pathogenicity, explain current 
lack efficient human-to-human transmission. knowledge critical in
evaluating pandemic risk viruses pose.
