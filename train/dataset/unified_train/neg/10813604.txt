one hundred five rabies isolates obtained domestic animals and
insectivorous bats chile 1977 1998 molecularly characterized 
by limited sequence analysis nucleoprotein genes. isolates were
compared viruses isolated known domestic wildlife rabies reservoirs
in americas identify potential reservoirs rabies chile. the
phylogenetic analyses showed none chilean isolates segregated with
viruses terrestrial reservoirs. non-rabies lyssaviruses found in
this study. chilean samples related viruses sylvatic cycle
maintained common vampire bat (desmodus rotundus) latin america. five
genetic variants identified insectivorous bats chile. brazilian 
free-tailed bat (tadarida brasiliensis) identified reservoir the
rabies genetic variant frequently isolated country 1977 and
1998. close association group viruses obtained domestic dog
(canis familiaris), brazilian free-tailed bats, red bat (lasiurus borealis)
with viruses maintained lasiurus spp. north america implicated species of
this genus possible reservoirs particular genetic variant in
chile. reservoirs three variants remain unknown.
