using short-term transfection assay, show e4 early adenovirus
promoter expressed certain extent undifferentiated f9 pcc4 cells, 
which known possess cellular e1a-like activity. also observed that
c-myc products trans-activate e4 promoter ec stem cells hela cells.
using 5' deletion mutants e4 promoter, show target
sequence used c-myc e1a. sequence located positions
-179 -158 upstream cap site known contain activating
transcription factor (atf)-binding site. moreover, basal level activity
of deletion mutants. related number atf binding sites. we
therefore suggest c-myc functional cellular homolog viral e1a
gene might correspond one cellular e1a-like activities
previously described ec stem cells. also observed c-myc
plasmid coding p67 64 proteins, contrast one coding p64
only, able trans-activate e4 e2a adenovirus promoter, suggesting
that p67 protein plays essential part activation.
