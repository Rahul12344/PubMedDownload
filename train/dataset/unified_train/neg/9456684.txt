objective: oral hairy leukoplakia (ohl) characterised presence a
replicative epstein-barr virus (ebv) superficial layers epithelium.
there doubt, however, whether reflects activation latent
infection basal epithelial cells. ebv latency associated the
expression viral gene product ebna-i aim study to
investigate ebna-i expression ohl.
methods: 22 biopsies clinically suspicious ohl three cases normal
mucosa available fresh frozen paraffin embedded material. ebna-i was
detected immunocytochemically using rat monoclonal antibody (ih4-i) following
microwave irradiation. lytic ebv infection confirmed identification of
the bzlf-i protein.
results: 16 22 cases displayed focal replicative ebv meeting criteria 
for ohl, 13 these, ebna-i expression restricted nuclei of
epithelial cells upper layers epithelium. ebna-i expression was
absent basal cells cases nine bzlf-i negative mucosal 
biopsies.
conclusion: findings suggest lytic ebv infection ohl the
result activation latent infection basal cells suggests role for
ebna-i, latent ebv infection, also virus replication.
