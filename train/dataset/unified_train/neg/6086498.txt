a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (focus--friendship china united
states) derived patient primary hepatocellular carcinoma. this
cell line continuous culture 18-mo period. morphological 
and ultrastructural features focus consistent neoplastic
hepatocellular origin. focus cells contain aspartate aminotransferase and
glucose-6-phosphatase activity. addition, alpha 1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen,
alpha fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigens detectable cytoplasm
of cultured cells immunochemical staining techniques. karyotype the
focus cell human origin contains human dna sequences detected by
molecular hybridization analysis. focus cells show evidence of
density-dependent inhibition growth confluent conditions. repeated
growth curves 18-mo period identical, revealing doubling time of
42 48 h. malignant potential focus cells demonstrated by
their ability lead gross tumor formation subcutaneous injection 
nude mice. one solid tumors grown nude mice, recultured cell lines
have established found properties identical original
focus cell line. focus cell line represents additional model 
investigation tumor specific antigens relationship hepatitis b
virus (hbv) hepatocellular carcinoma. preliminary molecular characterization 
has indicated existence integrated hbv sequences within focus genome.
