the origins many plant diseases appear recent associated the
rise domestication, spread agriculture recent global movements of
crops. distinguishing possibilities problematic the
difficulty determining rates molecular evolution short time frames.
heterochronous approaches using recent historical samples show plant
viruses exhibit highly variable often rapid rates molecular evolution. the
accuracy estimated evolution rates age origin greatly improved
with inclusion older molecular data archaeological material. 
present first reconstruction archaeological rna genome, of
barley stripe mosaic virus (bsmv) isolated barley grain ~750 years age.
phylogenetic analysis bsmv includes genome indicates divergence 
of bsmv closest relative prior time, likely around 2000
years ago. however, exclusion archaeological data results apparently
much recent origin virus postdates even archaeological
sample. conclude viral lineage originated near east north 
africa, spread north america east asia hosts along
historical trade routes.
