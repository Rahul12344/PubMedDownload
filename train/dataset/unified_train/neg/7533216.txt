the binding 28 kda yeast tata binding protein (ytbp) hiv adeno 
major late promoters examined electron microscopy (em). three
different em preparative methods employed: direct mounting shadowcasting
of fixed samples, cryofixation freeze-drying followed shadowcasting, and
negative staining unfixed samples. excellent agreement among three methods
was obtained. ten ytbp monomers/dna fragment, 25% dna molecules
contained easily distinguished protein particles tata box and, less
frequently, smaller particles observed. non-specific binding dna ends was
common. mass easily distinguished particles measured 63(+/- 5) kda
(cryofixation shadowcasting) 48(+/- 6) kda (negative staining) indicating
tbp dimerization. 22 44 ytbp monomers/dna, ytbp polymerization produced 
dna-protein rods 9 nm wide 20 30 nm long, frequently two dna strands 
exiting one end. bending analysis revealed ytbp dimers bend dna about
the tata box 80 90 degrees. although protein ratios relatively
high, structures formed demonstrate propensity ytbp engage in
protein-protein interactions.
