the new world arenaviruses, junin, machupo, guanarito, sabia, chapare, are
associated rapidly progressing severe hemorrhagic fever high rate 
case fatality various regions south america. threat natural or
deliberate outbreaks associated viruses makes development of
preventive therapeutic measures important. describe junin virus
functional minigenome system reverse genetics system production of
infectious junin virus. robust, highly efficient system involves
transfection cells two plasmids transcribe virus l
antigenomic rnas. utility system demonstrated generating junin
viruses encode glycoprotein precursor (gpc) containing following: (i)
the wild-type (ski-1/s1p peptidase) cleavage site, (ii) cleavage site, or
(iii) cleavage site ski-1/s1p motif (rslk) replaced furin
cleavage site (rrkr). contrast wild-type virus, junin virus lacking a
gpc cleavage site replicated within successfully transfected cells failed 
yield infectious virus particles. confirms observations other
arenaviruses suggesting gpc cleavage essential arenavirus
infectivity. contrast, infectious junin virus encoded gpc cleaved by
furin-like proteases easily generated. two-plasmid, high efficiency
aspects junin virus reverse genetics system show great promise for
addressing important questions regarding arenavirus hemorrhagic fever disease and
for development precisely attenuated live arenavirus vaccines.
