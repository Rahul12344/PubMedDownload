background: cell-culture-derived (cc) influenza vaccine production methods could 
provide benefits classical embryonated-egg technology, including higher
production capacity faster creation supply meets demand.
methods: cc-inactivated split-virus influenza a/indonesia/5/2005(h5n1) vaccine 
derived eb66 cell line (hereafter, "cc-h5n1") investigated a
phase 1 randomized, blinded study. healthy adults (n = 521) received 2 vaccine
doses (days 0 21) either investigational cc-h5n1 vaccine (1.9 µg 3.75
µg hemagglutinin antigen [ha] as03 adjuvant system 15 µg plain 
ha), embryonated-egg-derived vaccines (3.75 µg ha as03 15 µg plain 
ha), placebo. assessment adjuvant effect immunogenicity was
performed using center biologics evaluation research acceptability
criteria 21 days dose 2. safety assessed month 12.
results: as03-adjuvanted cc-h5n1 elicited homologous hemagglutination
inhibition antibody response satisfied immunogenicity criteria 21 days after
dose 2 persisted month 12. adjuvant effect immune response a
drift-variant strain demonstrated. vaccine-related serious adverse events
were reported. immunogenicity safety cc-h5n1 formulation
containing 3.75 µg ha as03 appeared similar the
licensed egg-derived as03-adjuvanted control vaccine.
conclusions: feasibility eb66 cell line produce immunogenic
influenza vaccine acceptable safety profile demonstrated. antigen
sparing achieved combination as03 adjuvant. cc-h5n1 might
contribute rapid access vaccine event influenza a(h5n1)
pandemic.
