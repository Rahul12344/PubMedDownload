in general, biological structural properties hepatitis delta virus
resemble viroids related satellite rna viruses plants. this
resemblance strengthened discovery that, analogy the
self-cleaving plant rna viruses, hepatitis delta virus rna possesses
autocleaving autoligating sites located sequences homologous with
highly conserved domains viroids. catalytic properties identify the
hepatitis delta virus first mammalian ribozyme. current interpretation
of pathobiology delta hepatitis rests postulates hepatitis
delta virus invariably requires hepatitis b virus infection highly
pathogenic. accordingly, delta hepatitis thought occur hepatitis delta
virus coinfects hepatitis b virus superinfects hepatitis b virus 
carriers. however, new evidence liver transplantation model suggests
that hepatitis delta virus capable establishing latent, asymptomatic
infections without apparent assistance hepatitis b virus: model,
disease reactivated hepatitis b virus also returned graft.
thus, hepatitis b virus superinfection latent hepatitis delta virus state
may third pathobiological mechanism conducive delta hepatitis.
