the aim review present new data epidermodysplasia verruciformis 
(ev) ev human papillomaviruses (hpvs), regarded previously specific the
disease. recently introduced highly sensitive molecular methods virologic
studies allow detection ev hpvs non-ev populations. article, we
present recent findings ev ev hpvs, shed new light a
possible contribution ev viruses malignant benign epidermal
proliferation. discuss significance ev hpv dna detection in
premalignant cutaneous lesions nonmelanoma skin cancers; however, direct
evidence causative role ev hpv still available. psoriasis, a
high frequency ev hpv-5 ev hpvs skin presence of
specific hpv-5 antibodies strongly suggest expression ev hpv proteins 
extensive epidermal proliferation. epidermodysplasia verruciformis hpv-5 may also
be transiently expressed epidermal repair processes, whereas psoriasis
there continuous epidermal proliferation could result persistent
viral expression. potential contribution ev hpvs pathogenesis of
psoriasis also supported recently disclosed co-localization of
susceptibility loci psoriasis ev region chromosome arm
17qter; however, specific genes conditions still identified.
