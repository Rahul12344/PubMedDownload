hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection leading cause endstage liver disease 
in western asian countries. however, liver transplantation, hcv recurs 
in virtually patients, estimated hcv-related graft cirrhosis 5-year
follow-up 30%. although immunosuppression accounts major part the
accelerated progression hcv transplant population, best
immunosuppression recipients hcv could avoid complication
remains unknown present. combination therapy interferon ribavirin is
thought effective treatment prophylaxis hcv
infection. however, treated, treatment initiated,
and agent patients hcv infection treated still
unknown. current data hcv recurrence patients received either 
living- deceased-donor liver transplantation controversial, are, 
presumably, similar. thus, avoid hcv recurrence living-donor liver
transplantation, take approaches similar used patients
receiving deceased-donor liver transplantation. based reports major
transplant centers around world, consider best strategy liver
transplantation-related hcv infection steroid-free immunosuppression and
preemptive low-dose interferon ribavirin combination therapy. we
describe experience living-donor liver transplantion patients with
hepatitis c osaka university. need standardizing treatment 
for hcv infection. achieved collaborative work between
various liver transplant centers worldwide.
