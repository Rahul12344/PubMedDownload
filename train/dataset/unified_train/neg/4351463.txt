cytomegalovirus replication cells pretreated 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine.

st jeor s, rapp f.

the replication human cytomegalovirus (cmv) cells pretreated with
5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (iudr) studied. pretreatment cells iudr
enhanced several parameters virus replication. virus grown drug-treated
cells exhibited shorter eclipse period cells produced infectious
virus sooner untreated cells. approximate fivefold increase
in virus yield per cell drug-treated samples compared control
cultures. time required plaque development shortened 6 days in
drug-treated cultures. pretreatment cells iudr also increased plaquing
efficiency virus approximately 10-fold. enhancement virus
replication iudr demonstrated varying multiplicity of
infection. 7-day period 100-fold increase sensitivity 
cultures virus detection cells previously exposed iudr. 
the data presented indicate possibility iudr interferes the
production cellular product inhibitory cmv replication.
