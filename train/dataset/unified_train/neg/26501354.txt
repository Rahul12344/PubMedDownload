disulfiram, exhibits marked tumor inhibition mediated copper, was
encapsulated lipid nanocapsules modified tat peptide (tatp) and
ph-triggered sheddable peg target cancer cells basis tumor
environmental specificity. peg-shedding lipid nanocapsules (s-lncs) were
fabricated lncs decorating short peg chains tatp (hs-peg(1k)-tatp)
to form tatp-lncs covered ph-sensitive graft copolymers long peg
chains (pga-g-peg(2k)). dsf-s-lncs sizes range 60-90 nm and
were stable presence 50% plasma. dsf-s-lncs exhibited higher
intracellular uptake antitumor activity ph 6.5 ph 7.4. the
preincubation cu showed dsf cytotoxicity based the
accumulation cu hep g2 cells. pharmacokinetic studies showed markedly
improved pharmacokinetic profiles dsf-s-lncs (auc= 3921.391 μg/l·h, t(1/2z) = 
1.294 h) compared free dsf (auc = 907.724 μg/l·h, t(1/2z) = 0.252 h). in
vivo distribution s-lncs investigated using cy5.5 fluorescent probe. 
in tumor-bearing mice, delivery efficiency s-lncs found 496.5%
higher free cy5.5 74.5% higher lncs tumors. in
conclusion, dsf-s-lncs increased stability tumor internalization and
further increased cytotoxicity higher copper content.
