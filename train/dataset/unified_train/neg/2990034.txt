malignant transformation erythroid cells vivo introduction a
nonreplicating retrovirus vector.

wolff l, ruscetti s.

dna replication-defective spleen focus-forming virus (sffv) was
reconstructed transfected psi-2 cells containing packaging-defective
mutant moloney murine leukemia virus. replication-incompetent retrovirus
particles (helper virus-free containing genomes express transforming
envelope gene sffv (gp52) transformed bone marrow cells vitro and, after
direct intravenous introduction vector, induced malignant erythroid
disease vivo. disease induction dependent prior treatment mice 
phenylhydrazine, probably increased availability erythroid target
cells. since evidence virus particle expression mice with
malignant disease, study demonstrates acute oncogenic potential a
limited number erythroid cells expressing sffv gp52. direct inoculation of
animals nonreplicating retroviral vectors containing transforming genes may 
be useful study oncogenic effects genes.
