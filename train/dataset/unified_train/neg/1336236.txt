the objective work investigate dynamics pathological lesions
of chicken organs infection high doses turkey herpesvirus
thv-bio-i. virus strain commonly used form marvak vaccine
against marek's disease poultry czechoslovakia. high doses vaccine
are used practice respect epizootological situation. incidence
of pathological lesions organs brown leghorn chickens investigated 
in five-week experiment. one-day chickens infected intramuscularly with
the hvt strain doses approximately 10(2), 10(3) 10(4) pfu 0.2 ml
of infective inoculum per chick. body weights ten chickens group
were recorded intervals 1, 2, 3 5 weeks infection, serological
examination performed precipitating antibodies mdv feather was
examined mdv-antigen. bursae fabricii spleens weighed. thymus,
bursae fabricii, spleens, peripheral nerves (n. ischiadicus pl. brachialis)
and gonads sampled histopathological examination. neither maternal nor
post-infection antibodies found chick. cytolytic lesion severity of
lymphoid organs scored using scale immunosuppression degrees (0-4).
morphological criteria published previous paper (halouzka jurajda, 
1991b). differences observed weights bursa fabricii spleen
between infected control chickens statistically significant. the
observed lymphoid infiltrations skin, gonads, nerves tissues
following hvt infection well-known correlate infection
