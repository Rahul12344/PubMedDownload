gastrointestinal lymphomas: morphology, immunophenotype molecular features.

bautista-quach ma, ake cd, chen m, wang j.

primary gastrointestinal lymphoma comprises 10-15% non-hodgkin lymphomas
and encompasses 30-40% total extranodal lymphomas. approximately 60-75% of
cases occur stomach, small bowel, ileum, cecum, colon and
rectum. lymphoid neoplasms may consist mature b, less commonly
extranodal nk/t cells. these, two frequently encountered histologic
subtypes extranodal marginal zone lymphoma mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue (malt lymphoma), helicobacter pylori infection implicated a
number cases, diffuse large b cell lymphoma. several b cell lymphomas 
associated chromosomal aberrations. enteropathy-associated cell lymphoma, 
type particular, usually arises background celiac disease. cell
gene rearrangement confirms clonality. nk/t cell neoplasms invariably
associated epstein-barr virus infection often aggressive; thus,
differentiation benign nk-cell enteropathy paramount. although
incidence hematopoietic malignancies gastrointestinal tract 
as plasma cell myeloma associated amyloidosis, plasmablastic lymphoma,
hodgkin disease, histiocytic sarcoma mast cell sarcoma extremely rare,
these entities documented, latter two demonstrating aggressive
clinical behavior. endoscopic ultrasonography important adjunct disease 
staging follow-up. conservative antibiotic treatment stage malt
lymphomas associated helicobacter pylori infection achieves good clinical
outcome high remission rate. chemotherapy, radiation rarely surgery 
reserved advanced diseases cases resistant conservative therapy and
those associated helicobacter pylori infection.
