gene therapy may offer new treatment option, particularly patients with
severe hemophilia, based recent research. however, individuals with
pre-existing immunity adeno-associated viruses (aavs) may less likely to
benefit aav vector-based therapies. study pre-existing aav5 immunity in
humans, validated two complementary, sensitive, scalable vitro assays
to detect aav5 total antibodies transduction inhibition (ti). using two
assays, found 53% samples 100 healthy male individuals were
negative assays, 18% positive assays, 5% positive for
total antibodies negative ti and, interest, 24% negative for
total antibodies positive ti activity, suggesting presence of
non-antibody-based neutralizing factors human plasma. similar findings were
obtained 24 samples individuals hemophilia a. basis of
these results, describe development dual-assay strategy identify
individuals without total aav5 antibodies neutralizing factors may more
likely respond aav5-directed gene therapy. assays offer universal, 
transferrable platform across laboratories assess global prevalence of
aav5 antibodies neutralizing factors large patient populations help
inform clinical development strategies.
