a single-chain antibody fragments (scfv) developed directed against
transmembrane envelope glycoprotein gp46 virus maedi-visna, the
application antibody phage display library. get specific scfv binders, 
the library panned biotinylated peptide 20 amino acids
corresponding principal immunodominant domain gp46 protein. number 
of positively binding scfvs evaluated scfv-phage elisa, bstn1
fingerprinting dna sequencing. scfvs expressed soluble form and
purified immobilized metal affinity chromatography (imac) yield of
2-2.5 mg/l. two scfvs shown recognize gp46 gp150 proteins western 
blot analysis. scfvs also recognized virus infected cells shown 
immunofluorescence assay. affinity obtained antibody fragments gp46
peptide measured surface plasmon resonance, resulting k(a) 
the 10(6)-10(7)lmol(-1) range. application characterized scfvs for
expression intrabodies intracellular immunization virus maedi-visna
infection diagnosis virus discussed.
