background: avian influenza remains serious threat human health. the
consequence human infection varies markedly among different subtypes avian 
influenza viruses. addition viral factors, difference host cellular 
response likely play critical role. study aims elucidating how
avian influenza infection perturbs host's mirna regulatory pathways may 
lead adverse pathological events, cytokine storm, using mirna
microarray approach.
results: results showed dysregulation mirna expression mainly
observed highly pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 infection. found that
mir-21*, mir-100*, mir-141, mir-574-3p, mir-1274a mir1274b were
differentially expressed response influenza virus infection.
interestingly, demonstrated mir-141, highly induced by
h5n1 h1n1 (p < 0.05), ability suppress expression a
cytokine - transforming growth factor (tgf)-β2. supported the
observation inhibitory effect could reversed antagomir-141.
conclusions: since tgf-β2 important cytokine act an
immunosuppressive agent potent proinflammatory molecule ability
to attract regulate inflammatory molecules, previous report showed that
only seasonal influenza h1n1 (but avian influenza subtypes) could
induce persistent expression tgf-β2, speculate modulation of
tgf-β2 expression different influenza subtypes via mir-141 might critical
step determining outcome either normal excessive inflammation
progression.
