the adult mammalian kidney tubule epithelium exists relatively dormant,
slowly replicative state large potential regenerative morphogenesis
following severe ischemic toxic injury. selective serum-free growth
conditions, included epidermal growth factor retinoic acid, a
subpopulation renal proximal tubule cells isolated adult rabbit kidney
were grown cell culture. cells possessed two important characteristics: 
1) ability differentiate morphogenically tubule structures grown 
in three-dimensional collagen gels 2) high capacity self-renewal, since
cell lineage analysis recombinant retrovirus demonstrated vitro
tubulogenesis arose clonal expansion single cell. thus individual cells
in adult kidney retained ability kidney tubulogenesis vitro.
