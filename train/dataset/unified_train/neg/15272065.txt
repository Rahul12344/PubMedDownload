two cases chronic stromal keratitis described immunocompetent hosts
where diagnosis originally thought herpetic adenoviral disease. 
light microscopy ultrastructural examination corneal tissue electron
microscopy performed following penetrating keratoplasty (case 1) corneal
biopsy (case 2). specimens cases analysed viral identification
by pcr. two different species microsporidia identified. case 1 represents
the fourth reported case corneal stromal vittaforma corneae spores
measured 3.3 x 1.4 microm, arranged characteristic linear groups four
to eight. spore contained diplokaryotic nucleus single row ten
polar tube coils. contrast, case 2 first reported case stromal
keratitis caused trachipleistophora hominis. case, spores measured 4 x
2.4 microm, located typically within packets. species, polar tube was
arranged single row 10-13 profiles. viral dna could be
amplified pcr. conclusion, microsporidial stromal keratitis be
considered culture-negative cases refractory medical therapy. as
microbiological culture techniques unsuccessful, diagnosis may be
established following histopathological ultrastructural examination of
corneal tissue.
