human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) requires incorporation of
cyclophilin (cypa) replication. cypa packaged binding capsid
(ca) region gag. interaction disrupted cyclosporine (csa).
preventing cypa incorporation, either mutations binding region ca or
by presence csa, abrogates virus infectivity. given cypa possesses an
isomerase activity, proposed cypa acts uncoating factor by
destabilizing shell ca surrounds viral genome. however, because
the domain cypa responsible isomerase activity its
capacity packaged, challenging determine isomerase
activity required hiv-1 replication. address issue, fused cypa 
to viral protein r (vpr), creating vpr-cypa chimera. vpr packaged
via p6 region gag, approach bypasses interaction ca and
allows cypa incorporation even presence csa. using system, we
found vpr-cypa rescues infectivity viruses lacking cypa, either
produced presence csa mutated cypa packaging signal ca.
furthermore, vpr-cypa mutant isomerase activity capacity to
bind ca also rescues hiv-1 replication. thus, study demonstrates the
isomerase activity cypa required hiv-1 replication suggests
that interaction catalytic site cypa ca serves other
function incorporate cypa viruses.
