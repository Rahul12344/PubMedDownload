human herpesvirus-6 -7 (hhv-6, hhv-7) remain latent primary infection
and reactivate transplantation. hhv-6 active infection related
to clinical manifestation, role hhv-7 remains unclear. the
clinical significance hhv-7 dnaemia completely known immune
response hhv-7 poorly studied transplantation. study,
we investigated hhv-7 dnaemia liver transplant recipients evaluated the
immunoglobulin (ig) g igm response hhv-7. total 22 adult liver
transplant recipients followed 90 days. hhv-7 dnaemia detected by
nested polymerase chain reaction (pcr) dna extracted sera. igg igm
detection performed immunofluorescent assay using hhv-7-infected cord
blood mononuclear cells. significant virus antibody response defined as
either positive igm > =4-fold rise virus igg antibody. all
patients pre-transplant hhv-7-positive serostatus. nine 22 (40.9%)
patients presented hhv-7 dnaemia follow-up. patients had
anti-hhv-7-positive igm and/or significant increase igg titers concurrent
or subsequent dnaemia. patients without dnaemia low persistent igg
antibody titers, igm detected. correlation nested pcr igm
detection statistically significant (p=0.01). study indicates nested
pcr dna extraction serum useful detect monitor hhv-7 active
infection liver transplant recipients. igm antibody detection also be
useful first immunological technique detect active infection, especially 
if combined pcr.
