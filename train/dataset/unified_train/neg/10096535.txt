cytomegalovirus (cmv) strains resistant ganciclovir associated 
specific mutations ul97 ul54 genes. ul97 gene cmv strain
isolated renal transplant recipient 438 days of
ganciclovir treatment amplified polymerase chain reaction sequenced. a
novel mutation resulting deletion codons 595 603 identified the
viral dna specimens obtained after, before, prolonged ganciclovir
therapy. clinical virological resolution cmv disease occurred after
switching foscarnet therapy. although many ganciclovir resistance mutations
have mapped ul97 codon range 591-607, one unusual 
involves deletion half codons. ul97 seems necessary for
effective cmv replication, deletion suggests much codons 591-607 can
be removed without destroying biological function ul97, this
codon range altered various ways affect ganciclovir susceptibility. 
rapid, flexible genotypic assays directed part ul97 may facilitate the
early recognition ganciclovir resistance.
