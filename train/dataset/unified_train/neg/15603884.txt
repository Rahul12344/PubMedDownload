multivalent dengue vaccines late stage development pose unique vaccine
safety challenges primary secondary vaccine failures might place
vaccines risk antibody-dependent enhanced (ade) wild-type dengue
infections. conference organized address unique vaccine safety
issue. new data presented structure dengue flaviviruses,
the cellular receptors dengue virus biologically relevant cells, dengue
viral cell entry mechanisms mechanisms underlying vivo protection,
neutralization enhancement dengue virus infection. concluded a
targeted research program aim develop vitro test characterize 
persons immunized dengue vaccines completely partially protected.
achievement aim require better understanding basic
mechanisms dengue viruses recognize, attach, enter infect relevant
human cells antibodies protect dengue infections.
