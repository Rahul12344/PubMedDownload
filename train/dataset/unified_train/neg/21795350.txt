longitudinal studies cell immune responses viral infections humans
are essential understanding effector cell responses develop,
clear infection, provide long-lasting immunity. here, following outbreak
of puumala hantavirus infection human population, longitudinally
analyzed primary cd8 cell response infected individuals first
onset clinical symptoms viral clearance. vigorous cd8 cell response 
was observed early following onset clinical symptoms, determined the
presence high numbers ki67(+)cd38(+)hla-dr(+) effector cd8 cells. this
response encompassed 50% total blood cd8 cells, subsequently
contracted parallel decrease viral load. expression levels of
perforin granzyme b high throughout initial cell response and
likewise normalized following viral clearance. monitoring regulatory
components, induction regulatory cd4 cd8 cells observed the
patients infection. however, cd8 well cd4 cells exhibited a
distinct expression profile inhibitory pd-1 ctla-4 molecules. present 
results provide insight development cell response humans,
from onset clinical symptoms following viral infection to
resolution disease.
