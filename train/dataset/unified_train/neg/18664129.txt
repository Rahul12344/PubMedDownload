the present work aimed examine whether actin reorganization of
3t3-sv40 cells influences sensitivity natural killer (nk) cells
activity. effects n-acetylcystein (nac) latrunculin b, actin
depolimerizator, cellular parameters studied. experiments nac
demonstrated 3t3-sv40 sensitivity nk cells activity remained unchanged
under disordered microfilaments decreased upon appearance of
structured stress-fibres. data latrunculin b action resulted the
opposite conclusion: microfilaments disorganization presence of
latrunculin b lesser 3t3-sv40 sensitivity lysis nk cells. facts
suggest relations microfilament integrity 3t3-sv40 cells and
their sensitivity nk cells rather independent. latter confirms our
previous conclusion (gamaley et al., 2006). decrease 3t3-sv40 sensitivity to
nk cells activity accompanied actin reorganization resulted both
latrunculin b nac action suggests changes cellular surface, which
ultimately lead inactivation (or loss) molecules activating
signals nk cells.
