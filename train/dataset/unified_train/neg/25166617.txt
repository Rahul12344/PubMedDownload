while importance transmission pathogens widely accepted, is
currently little mechanistic understanding process. nasal carriage of
streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) common humans, especially in
early childhood, prerequisite development disease and
transmission among hosts. study, adapted infant mouse model to
elucidate host determinants transmission s. pneumoniae inoculated
index mice uninfected contact mice. context co-infection with
influenza virus, pneumococcus transmitted among wildtype littermates,
with approximately half contact mice acquiring colonization. mice
deficient tlr2 colonized similar density transmitted s.
pneumoniae efficiently (100% transmission) wildtype animals showed 
decreased expression interferon Î± higher viral titers. greater viral
burden tlr2-/- mice correlated heightened inflammation, was
responsible increase bacterial shedding mouse nose. role
of tlr2 signaling confirmed intranasal treatment wildtype mice the
agonist pam3cys, decreased inflammation reduced bacterial shedding 
transmission. taken together, results suggest innate immune
response influenza virus promotes bacterial shedding, allowing bacteria to
transit host host. findings provide insight role host
factors increased pneumococcal carriage rates seen flu season and
contribute overall understanding pathogen transmission.
