reactivation cytomegalovirus (cmv) occurs intensive immunosuppressive
therapies. however, influence cmv reactivation prognosis patients
with immunosuppressive therapies collagen-vascular diseases (cvd) not
fully understood. determine whether cmv reactivation affects prognosis 
patients cvd identify risk factors cmv reactivation, reviewed, 
retrospectively, medical records 109 cvd patients treated with
glucocorticoid (prednisolone ≥20 mg/day) tested cmv antigen
(cmv-ag). cmv-ag detected 34 109 patients. first-time cmv-ag
detection within 50 days start intensive immunosuppressive
therapy 82% patients. common manifestations first-time cmv-ag
detection fever, arthralgia, rash, although 52.9% patients were
asymptomatic. risk factors cmv reactivation old age (>65 years) 
high-dose glucocorticoids (psl ≥50 mg). 4-year study period, 18% of
patients positive cmv-ag 5% without cmv-ag died. patients 
cmv-ag (max cmv number ≥5/10(5) wbc) significantly poorer prognosis.
multivariate analysis confirmed cmv reactivation independent poor
prognostic factor cvd patients. causes death exacerbation of
pre-existing interstitial pneumonia infection cmv. results
demonstrate cmv reactivation, particularly high cmv-ag number, a
poor prognostic factor cvd patients. patients older age high-dose
glucocorticoids high risk cmv reactivation.
