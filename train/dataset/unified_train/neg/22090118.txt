the four kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv)-encoded interferon (ifn) 
regulatory factor homologues (virf1 virf4) used counter innate immune
defenses suppress p53. virf genes arranged tandem differ in
function expression. kshv-infected effusion lymphoma lines, k10.5/virf3
and k11/virf2 mrnas readily detected latency, whereas k9/virf1 and
k10/virf4 mrnas upregulated reactivation. show the
k10/virf4 promoter responds lytic switch protein rta kshv-infected
cells essentially unresponsive uninfected cells. coexpression rta
with virf4 sufficient restore regulation, property shared other
virfs. k9/virf1 promoter behaves similarly, production infectious
virus enhanced presence virf4. synergy requires dna-binding
domain (dbd) c-terminal irf homology regions virf4. mutations arginine 
residues within putative dna recognition helix virf4 invariant
cysteines adjacent cxxc motif abolish cooperation rta, latter 
case preventing self-association. oligomerization transactivation
functions rta also essential synergy. k10/virf4 promoter contains 
two transcription start sites (tsss), 105-bp fragment containing the
proximal promoter responsive virf4/rta. binding cellular factor(s) 
this fragment altered viral proteins present, suggesting a
possible mechanism transcriptional synergy. reliance coregulators encoded 
by either host viral genome provides elegant strategy expanding the
regulatory potential master regulator, rta.
