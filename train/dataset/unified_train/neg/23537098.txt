background: betaretroviruses infect wide range species including primates,
rodents, ruminants, marsupials. exist endogenous exogenous
forms implicated animal diseases lung cancer sheep, 
human disease, members human endogenous retrovirus-k (herv-k) group
of endogenous betaretroviruses (βervs) associated human cancers and
autoimmune diseases. improve understanding betaretroviruses an
evolutionarily distinct host species, characterized βervs present the
genomes transcriptomes mega- microbats, important
reservoir emerging viruses.
results: diverse range full-length βervs discovered mega- and
microbat genomes transcriptomes including first identified intact
endogenous retrovirus bat. analysis revealed genus
betaretrovirus divided eight distinct sub-groups evidence of
cross-species transmission. betaretroviruses revealed complex
retrovirus group, within one sub-group evolved complex simple
genomic organization acquisition env gene genus
gammaretrovirus. molecular dating suggests bats contended with
betaretroviral infections 30 million years.
conclusions: study reveals diverse range betaretroviruses have
circulated bats evolutionary history, cluster with
extant betaretroviruses divergent mammalian lineages suggesting their
distribution may largely unrestricted host species barriers. presence
of βervs ability transcribe active viral elements major animal
reservoir viral pathogens potential implications public health.
