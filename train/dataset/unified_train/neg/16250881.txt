as result introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy
(haart) many hiv-1 infected individuals able live improved extended
life style include prospect children. problematically, the
male reproductive organs may contribute infected cells free viral particles
to semen individuals, increasing risk infection hiv-1
positive male mother ultimately offspring. though autopsies 
aids infected individuals taught us great deal specific cell loss
and deterioration male organs setting, clear whether the
damage due specific targeting cells tissues hiv-1 an
indirect consequence viral dissemination later stages infection. due
to lack access organs early stages disease, little is
known progression pathogenesis infection within them,
particularly asymptomatic stage. molecular cellular aspects of
transmission virus remain unclear. although assisted reproductive
techniques successfully used achieve pregnancies discordant
couples developed world, investigating mechanism spread of
hiv-1 cells tissues male reproductive tract remains critical 
task, improve understanding, also enable design of
suitable treatment eradication infection potential
sanctuary site. review, discuss possible mechanisms infection
of male genital tract (mgt) may occur context anatomy and
immunology tissues male reproductive organs. revisit the
methodology used evaluate spread transmission hiv-1 these
tissues pinpoint future directions study may provide better
understanding underlying mechanisms hiv-1 transmission route.
