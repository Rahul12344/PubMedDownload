objective: elucidate biological activities vp3 protein bluetongue
virus (btv) expressed insect cells assemble, future, btv
core-like particles.
methods: first, full length btv13 l3 cdna constructed 2 sequenced
clones. silver staining splicing region proved construction
was correct. then, recombinant baculovirus expression vector pfb1bl3 was
constructed express l3 gene insect cells.
results: btv13 vp3 could highly expressed sf-9 cells, production could 
occupy 10%-15% total cell protein. core-like particles could be
observed co-expression vp3 vp7 insect cells.
conclusion: vp3 btv expressed insect cells possesses biological activity
and used assemble btv core-like particles.
