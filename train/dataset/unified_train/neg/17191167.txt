background: conflicting evidence regarding effects breast-feeding
on maternal mortality human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection,
and little known effects breast-feeding markers hiv-1
disease progression.
methods: hiv-1-seropositive women enrolled pregnancy received
short-course zidovudine. hiv-1 rna levels cd4 cell counts determined 
baseline months 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 postpartum compared
between breast-feeding formula-feeding mothers.
results: 296 women, 98 formula fed 198 breast-fed. baseline,
formula-feeding women higher education level prevalence of
hiv-1-related illness breast-feeding women; however, groups 
differ respect cd4 cell counts hiv-1 rna levels. months 1 and
24 postpartum, cd4 cell counts decreased 3.9 cells/ microl/month (p<.001), hiv-1 
rna levels increased 0.005 log(10) copies/ml/month (p=.03), body mass index
(bmi) decreased 0.03 kg/m(2)/month (p<.001). rate cd4 cell count decline
was higher breast-feeding mothers (7.2 cells/ microl/month) mothers
who never breast-fed (4.0 cells/ microl/month) (p=.01). bmi decreased more
rapidly breast-feeding women (p=.04), whereas hiv-1 rna levels mortality
did differ significantly breast-feeding formula-feeding women.
conclusions: breast-feeding associated significant decreases cd4 cell
counts bmi. hiv-1 rna levels mortality increased, suggesting a
limited adverse impact breast-feeding mothers receiving extended care for
hiv-1 infection.
