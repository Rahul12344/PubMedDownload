poria cocos long history medicinal use china. polysaccharides and
their derivatives medicine exhibit many beneficial biological activities
including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant antiviral activities. in
this study, new polysaccharide (pcp-ii) isolated sclerotium poria
cocos. physico-chemical characters identified adjuvant activity 
was investigated mice co-immunized h1n1 influenza vaccine hepatitis b
surface antigen (hbsag). results revealed pcp-ii molecular weight 
of 29.0kda. composed fucose, mannose, glucose galactose molar
ration 1.00:1.63:0.16:6.29 respectively. pharmacological data demonstrated
that pcp-ii increased antigen-specific antibody levels mice immunized with
influenza vaccine. pcp-ii also elicited anti-hbsag antibodies significantly
higher titers generated robust durable immunity compared mice
immunized hbsag-alum following two administrations. pcp-ii improved
proliferation splenocytes, stimulated il-12p70 tnf-α productions in
dendritic cells macrophages respectively. results suggested that
pcp-ii-adjuvanted vaccines enhanced humoral cellular immunity. pcp-ii could
be developed efficacious adjuvant human animal vaccines.
