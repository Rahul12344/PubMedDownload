background: known whether psychological stress suppresses host
resistance infection. investigate issue, prospectively studied 
relation psychological stress frequency documented clinical
colds among subjects intentionally exposed respiratory viruses.
methods: completing questionnaires assessing degrees psychological
stress, 394 healthy subjects given nasal drops containing one five
respiratory viruses (rhinovirus type 2, 9, 14, respiratory syncytial virus, or
coronavirus type 229e), additional 26 given saline nasal drops. the
subjects quarantined monitored development evidence of
infection symptoms. clinical colds defined clinical symptoms the
presence infection verified isolation virus increase 
the virus-specific antibody titer.
results: rates respiratory infection (p less 0.005) clinical
colds (p less 0.02) increased dose-response manner increases in
the degree psychological stress. infection rates ranged approximately 74 
percent approximately 90 percent, according levels psychological stress,
and incidence clinical colds ranged approximately 27 percent 47
percent. effects altered controlled age, sex,
education, allergic status, weight, season, number subjects housed
together, infectious status subjects sharing housing, and
virus-specific antibody status base line (before challenge). moreover, the
associations observed similar five challenge viruses. several
potential stress-illness mediators, including smoking, alcohol consumption,
exercise, diet, quality sleep, white-cell counts, total immunoglobulin
levels, explain association stress illness. similarly,
controls personality variables (self-esteem, personal control, and
introversion-extraversion) failed alter findings.
conclusions: psychological stress associated dose-response manner with
an increased risk acute infectious respiratory illness, risk was
attributable increased rates infection rather increased
frequency symptoms infection.
