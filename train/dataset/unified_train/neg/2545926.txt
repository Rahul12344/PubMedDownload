npc-kt cl.s61, subclone derived epithelial-nasopharyngeal carcinoma
hybrid cell line (npc-kt), showed cytopathic changes characteristic of
herpesvirus replication, including formation multinucleated giant cells and
inclusion bodies, epstein-barr virus replicative cycle induced by
5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. acyclovir (an inhibitor herpesvirus dna polymerase),
epstein-barr virus-immune human serum, 2-deoxyglucose (an inhibitor the
glycosylation) interfered syncytium formation, indicating a
virus-specified glycoprotein belonging late group responsible cell 
fusion induced epstein-barr virus replication cl.s61 cells.
