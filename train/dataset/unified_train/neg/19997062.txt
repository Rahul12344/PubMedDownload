in 2006, yamanaka colleagues first demonstrated retrovirus-mediated
delivery expression oct4, sox2, c-myc klf4 capable inducing 
pluripotent state mouse fibroblasts.(1) group also reported the
successful reprogramming human somatic cells induced pluripotent stem
(ips) cells using human versions transcription factors delivered by
retroviral vectors.(2) additionally, james thomson et al. reported the
lentivirus-mediated co-expression another set factors (oct4, sox2, nanog
and lin28) capable reprogramming human somatic cells ips cells.(3)
ips cells similar es cells morphology, proliferation ability to
differentiate tissue types body. human ips cells distinct 
advantage es cells exhibit key properties es cells without the
ethical dilemma embryo destruction. generation patient-specific ips
cells circumvents important roadblock personalized regenerative medicine
therapies eliminating potential immune rejection non-autologous
transplanted cells. demonstrate protocol reprogramming human
fibroblast cells using stemgent human tf lentivirus set. also show that
cells reprogrammed set begin show ips morphology four days
post-transduction. using stemolecule y27632, selected ips cells and
observed correct morphology three sequential rounds colony picking and
passaging. also demonstrate reprogramming cells displayed the
pluripotency marker ap, surface markers tra-1-81, tra-1-60, ssea-4, ssea-3,
and nuclear markers oct4, sox2 nanog.
