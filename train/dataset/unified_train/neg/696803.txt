four cases spontaneous adenocarcinoma canine exocrine pancreas were
studied thin section freeze-fracture electron microscopy. neoplastic
cells 4 cases acinar origin showed many alterations of
cytoarchitecture compared normal acinar cells. neoplastic cells,
zymogen granules varied number appearance contained abnormal
secretory product characterized 24-nm-thick microtubules. nuclear volume
and surface area nuclear cytoplasmic ratio increased; although the
nuclear pore density per nuclear surface area significantly decreased, 
was change nuclear pore density per nuclear volume. a
decrease number size gap junctions; focal proliferation, fragmentation,
and discontinuation tight junctions also noted. basal lamina (bl)
of neoplastic cells discontinuous. tumor microvasculature often
appeared sinusoids sparse discontinuous bl. finally, endothelium
in tumor normal tissue contained "tubulo-reticular inclusions" (tri)
which simulated distemper virus located rough endoplasmic
reticulum (rer) perinuclear cisternae.
