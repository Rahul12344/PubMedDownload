lateral gene transfer (lgt) demonstrated transfer process novel 
genes different species. lgt proceedings occurring microbes
and plants, well microbes animals. new evidence demonstrates
that bacterial insertional mutagenesis may occur cancer cells. due the
important role genetic changes increase cell proliferation and
cancer development, reviewed effects microbial-animal lgt human
oncogenesis. addition, viral dna induce cancer development random
insertion cancer-related genes inducing translocations. conclusion,
growing evidence shows contribution microbial genome cancer and
autoimmune disease.
