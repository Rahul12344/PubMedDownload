for infectious diseases, genetic cluster group closely related
infections usually interpreted representing recent outbreak of
transmission. genetic clustering methods becoming increasingly popular for
molecular epidemiology, especially context hiv now
considerable interest applying methods prioritize groups public
health resources pre-exposure prophylaxis. date, genetic clustering
has generally performed ad hoc algorithms, have
since encoded distributed free software. algorithms seldom
been validated simulated data clusters known, their
interpretation similarities transparent users outside the
field. here, provide brief overview development and
inter-relationships genetic clustering methods, evaluation six
methods data simulated epidemic model risk-structured
population. simulation analysis demonstrates majority clustering 
methods systematically biased detect variation sampling rates among
subpopulations, variation transmission rates. discuss results in
the context previous work implications public health applications 
of genetic clustering.
