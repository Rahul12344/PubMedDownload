although human papillomavirus (hpv) dna detected majority cervical
cancers precursors (squamous intraepithelial lesions; sil), the
persistence progression cervical lesions could associated with
quantitative functional alterations dendritic/langerhans cells (dc/lc). as
lc abnormalities associated decreased expression macrophage
inflammatory protein 3alpha (mip3alpha) cervical sil, tested effect 
exogenous mip3alpha migration lc (pre)neoplastic epithelium formed
in vitro. using boyden chamber assay, first showed migratory
capacity lc generated vitro significantly increased presence of
mip3alpha compared control medium. next demonstrated mip3alpha able
to increase 3d infiltration lc organotypic cultures hpv-transformed 
keratinocytes. property stimulate lc migration altered after
inclusion mip3alpha bioadhesive polycarbophil gel. moreover, function
of dc exert cytostatic effects present alloantigens altered 
the presence mip3alpha.
