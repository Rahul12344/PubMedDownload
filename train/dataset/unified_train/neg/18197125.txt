introduction: previous studies suggest indicators central adiposity 
as waist-to-hip ratio (whr) waist circumference may altered hiv
infection, antiretroviral treatment, both.
methods: waist hip circumference body mass index (bmi) measured
among participants women's interagency hiv study semiannually 1999 to
2004. generalized linear models evaluated longitudinal patterns measures
and associations demographic clinical characteristics.
results: whr significantly larger, whereas bmi waist hip
circumference significantly smaller almost 11 semiannual visits among
942 hiv-infected women compared 266 hiv-uninfected women. among
hiv-uninfected women, mean waist hip circumference bmi increased the
5-year study period (waist: +4.1 cm 4.4%, hip: +3.76 cm 3.5%, bmi +2.43
kg/m2 8.2%), whereas whr remained stable. among hiv-infected women, waist 
and hip circumference, bmi, whr significantly change. independent
predictors smaller bmi among hiv-infected women included white race, hepatitis
c virus seropositivity, current smoking, higher viral load, lower cd4 cell
count. independent predictors larger whr among hiv-infected women included
age, white non-african american race, higher cd4 cell count, and
protease inhibitor (pi) use. use highly active antiretroviral therapy
(haart) regimen independent predictor bmi whr.
conclusions: hiv-infected women higher whrs compared hiv-uninfected
women, despite lower bmis waist hip measurements. bmi waist hip
circumference increased 5 years among hiv-uninfected women remained 
stable hiv-infected women. among hiv-infected women, pi use associated
with larger whr, although haart use appreciably associated 
bmi whr.
