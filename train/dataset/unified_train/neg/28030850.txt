interleukin (il)-22+cd4+t (th22) cells play crucial roles pathogenesis 
autoimmune diseases infectious diseases, although role th22 cells
remains largely unclear children hand, foot, mouth disease (hfmd)
caused enterovirus 71 (ev71). study aims explore role of
circulating il-22+il-17a-cd4+t (cth22) cells children ev71-associated
hfmd. found acute stage illness, frequencies cth22
and circulating il-22+il-17a+cd4+t (il-22+cth17) cells cd4+t cells infrom
affected patients, especially severely affected patients, were
significantly higher healthy controls (hc). major source il-22
production cth22 cells, partially cth17 cells. moreover, protein and
mrna levels il-22, il-17a, il-23, il-6, tnf-α significantly different
among mild patients, severe patients hc, well ahr rorγt mrna
levels. positive correlation found plasma il-22 levels cth22
cell frequencies, cth17 cell il-22+ cth17 cell frequencies. furthermore, 
the frequencies cth22 significantly decreased convalescent
patients. findings indicated cth22 cells could play critical roles in
the pathogenesis ev71 infection, potential therapeutic targets for
patients ev71-associated hfmd.
