the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) mutant in1814 encodes altered form 
the virion protein vp16 unable transactivate immediate-early (ie)
transcription. consequence mutation, in1814 initiates productive
replication inefficiently infection tissue culture cells. previous
studies showed defect could overcome inclusion culture
medium hexamethylene bisacetamide (hmba), compound promotes the
differentiation murine erythroleukemia cells (melcs). effects of
additional agents known induce differentiation melcs investigated.
n'-methylnicotinamide, concentrations optimal induction melcs,
complemented replication in1814 stimulated ie gene expression.
suberoyl bishydroxamic acid suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, induce
differentiation melcs micromolar concentrations, complement in1814 
but specifically blocked action hmba. histone deacetylase inhibitor
trichostatin a, also induces differentiation melcs, antagonized the
effect hmba manner similar suberoyl bishydroxamic acid and
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid. results demonstrate requirement for
vp16 activity dependent metabolic state host cell the
pathways leading complementation in1814 differentiation melcs are
overlapping identical.
