the paper reviews histopathology cytopathology number of
experimental animal brain tumor models determine relevance human
neuro-oncology. models discussed include brain tumors produced local
implants carcinogenic hydrocarbons administration resorptive
n-nitroso compounds, cell lines derived latter, tumors
resulting intracerebral inoculation oncogenic viruses, the
differentiating neuroepithelial component transplantable mouse teratoma. the
structural biochemical criteria applied identification of
the various stages neuronal glial cell maturation highly precise. they
reveal wide diversity tumor cell types available in
experimental neuro-oncogenesis.
