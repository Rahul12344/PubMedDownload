acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) spectrum conditions caused 
infection human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). two types hiv been
characterized: hiv-1 hiv-2. present study investigated whether
evolutionary selection pressure differs rapid progressor (rp), slow
progressor (sp), long-term non-progressor (ltnp) hiv-i infected
individuals. unexpected association evolutionary rate of
substitution envelope (env) gene disease progression observed. our
present study suggests env genes ltnp subject unusually strong
functional constraint respect rp. also observed three
categories env genes i.e., rp, sp, ltnp, characteristic
pattern amino acid usage sp ltnp sequences shared similar patterns 
amino acid usage different rp sequences evolutionary rate significantly 
influenced amino acid usage pattern three different types env gene 
sequences. also noted evolutionary rate glycosylation
sites ltnp sp sequences even significantly less rp
sequences. comparative analysis influence human host three
categories env genes well correlated rates disease progression
suggesting adaptive strategies viruses successful residence and
infection. host associated selective constraints appeared relaxed rp 
sequences strongest ltnp sequences. present study clearly portrays how
evolutionary selection pressure differs three categories env genes
i.e., rp, sp, ltnp. env genes, coding env glycoproteins,
experience severe selection constraints host due constant
exposure host immune system. perspective might suggested
that env gene evolution occurs mainly negative selection occurrence
of mutation might reach fixation viral population. work also
confers deeper insight crucial effects host factors govern the
overall progression hiv infection.
