the complete genome chilean isolate cl-766 grapevine
leafroll-associated virus-3 (glrav-3) sequenced. first
genome sequence obtained glrav-3 isolate southern hemisphere. the
genomic rna 17,919 nucleotides contains 13 open reading frames (orfs) 5' 
and 3' untranslated regions (utr) 158 277 nucleotides, respectively.
comparison ny1, isolate complete genomic sequence available
today, shows 97.6% nucleotide identity two isolates. examination of
the genome variability shows genetic diversity concentrated
in orf1a. three additional isolates different geographic regions chile
were partially sequenced well, one showed sequence divergence with
respect local foreign isolates, indicative different
evolutionary constrains. immunodetection systems developed using monoclonal 
and polyclonal antibodies produced recombinant major coat protein 
glrav-3, providing sensitive specific detection using triple antibody
sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (tas-elisa) an
immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ic-rt-pcr) assay.
