bacteriophages may useful surrogates animal viruses virucidal 
properties different photosensitizing compounds initially investigated. we
studied photoinactivation four bacteriophages, phi x174, t7, prd1, phi 6, 
by dye merocyanine 540 (mc540) (15 micrograms/ml). merocyanine 540 (mc540)
should effective lipid-containing viruses, since primarily
lipophilic (but also binds proteins). two phages, prd1 phi 6
contain lipid, phi 6 external lipoprotein envelope. filtered 
radiation (450-600 nm) 750 w projector used 16-100 w/m2. the
survival curves different viruses clearly demonstrated different levels of
sensitivity photoinactivation mc540, phi 6 (do = 1.5 kj/m2) 
most sensitive, followed t7 (21-fold less sensitive). prd1 phi 
6 lipid components, phi 6 photoinactivated mc540. thus the
internal lipid components prd1 sufficient allow photoinactivation 
by dye, fluences 300 kj/m2. comparison, also
photoinactivated herpes simplex virus (do = 0.053 kj/m2) found be
28-fold sensitive phi 6 photoinactivation concentration 
of mc540. thus phi 6 may used surrogate enveloped human viruses for
photoinactivation lipophilic dyes, results may useful
qualitatively.
