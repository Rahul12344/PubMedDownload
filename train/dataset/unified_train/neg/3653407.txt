the primary amino acid sequence within domain 89 residues central
part 3'-orf protein (p27 3'-orf) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv-2)
shares homology middle carboxy-terminal portion bel3 gene
product human spumaretrovirus (hsrv). addition, limited region tat
protein hiv-2 hiv-1 shows 28% degree homology deduced
protein sequence bel1 gene product hsrv. comparison viral
sequences suggests 3'-orf bel1 gene product hsrv could serve
similar functions hiv-2.
