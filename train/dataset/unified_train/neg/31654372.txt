this case report presents 1-year-old boy china, sudden onset of
fever, convulsion, sleepiness, screened viral dna blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (csf) sample using next-generation sequencing (ngs) to
diagnose herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) encephalitis, validated by
pcr. acyclovir treatment, patient's symptom disappeared hsv-1 dna
unique reads decreased 4290 zero csf, 23 zero blood
detected ngs. clinical presentation outcome consistent the
pathogenic diagnostic results ngs. ngs csf samples used a
diagnostic assay hsv-1 encephalitis also might semi-quantitative
method evaluation treatment effect.
