background/aims: study aimed elucidate clinical characteristics of
patients chronic liver disease aged 80 years more, especially factors
affecting prognosis carcinogenesis.
methods: total 135 patients aged 80 years divided chronic
liver disease without cirrhosis (non-lc) cirrhosis (lc) groups according to
the severity fibrosis, clinical characteristics prognoses were
evaluated.
results: seventy-three (54.1%) 135 patients lc group 79
patients (58.5%) hepatitis c virus. various concomitant diseases seen in
122 patients (90.4%). liver-related deaths occurred 19 (36.5%) 52
patients died observation, although 28 patients (53.8%) liver
cancer time death. cumulative survival rates non-lc lc
groups 85.7% 58.8% 5th year, 69.4% 19.4% 9th year,
respectively. cumulative liver cancer appearance rates non-lc lc
groups 1.6% 6.1% 1st year, 12.4% 19.9% 5th year, and
12.4% 32.0% 7th year, respectively. multivariate cox regression
analysis revealed presence liver cancer (p=0.0001), platelet count
(p=0.0242), fibrotic stage (p=0.0118) independently associated with
survival period, alfa-fetoprotein (p=0.0194) bilirubin (p=0.0282) were
independently associated carcinogenesis.
conclusions: cirrhosis major risk factor affecting prognosis. the
other hand, must pay attention concomitant diseases specific to
advanced age.
