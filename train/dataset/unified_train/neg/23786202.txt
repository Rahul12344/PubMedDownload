objective: determine effect bovine leukemia virus (blv) infection on
absolute neutrophil lymphocyte concentrations healthy lactating holstein
dairy cattle.
design: observational cross-sectional survey.
animals: 311 healthy lactating holstein dairy cattle herds michigan (n = 
2), wisconsin (1), iowa (1), pennsylvania (1).
procedures: whole anticoagulated (edta) blood samples collected. serum
samples tested antibody blv use elisa. absolute
neutrophil lymphocyte concentrations measured edta blood samples with
an automated hematology analyzer manual differential cell counts.
results: 208 cows tested positive 103 cows tested negative anti-blv
antibodies. neutrophil concentration significantly different between
blv-positive versus blv-negative cattle. distribution lymphocyte
concentration positively skewed entire cow population (n = 311) and
the blv-positive subset (208). contrast, lymphocyte concentration distribution
was approximately normal blv-negative cows (n = 103). consequently, the
presence absence blv infection strongly influenced calculated
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte concentration ratio.
conclusions clinical relevance: results indicated absolute lymphocyte
concentration significantly affected blv infection dairy cattle.
accordingly, hematologic reference intervals derived healthy
animals infected blv patient blv status must considered 
for meaningful interpretation lymphocyte concentration. recommend 
calculated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio abandoned not
provide information direct comparison patient absolute leukocyte
concentration updated reference intervals healthy blv-negative cattle.
