porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (pedv) detected may 2013 first
time u.s. swine since caused significant economic loss. obtaining a
u.s. pedv isolate grow efficiently cell culture critical for
investigating pathogenesis developing diagnostic assays vaccine
development. additional objective determine gene(s) pedv is
most suitable studying genetic relatedness virus. describe
two pedv isolates (isu13-19338e isu13-22038) successfully obtained the
small intestines piglets sow farms indiana iowa, respectively. the
two isolates serially propagated cell culture 30 passages
and characterized first 10 passages. virus production cell
culture confirmed pedv-specific real-time reverse-transcription pcr
(rt-pcr), immunofluorescence assays, electron microscopy. infectious
titers viruses first 10 passages ranged 6 × 10(2) 2 ×
10(5) 50% tissue culture infective doses (tcid50)/ml. addition, the
full-length genome sequences six viruses (isu13-19338e homogenate, p3, p9;
isu13-22038 homogenate, p3, p9) determined. genetically, two pedv
isolates relatively stable first 10 passages cell culture.
sequences also compared 4 additional u.s. pedv strains 23
non-u.s. strains. u.s. pedv strains genetically closely related 
other (≥99.7% nucleotide identity) genetically similar chinese
strains reported 2011 2012. phylogenetic analyses using different genes 
pedv suggested full-length spike gene s1 portion appropriate
for sequencing study genetic relatedness viruses.
