combined vivo/ex vivo cell depletion effective prophylaxis of
graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) allogeneic bone marrow transplantation
(bmt), influences occurrence active cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection
and disease. twenty nine patients receiving cell-depleted marrow graft
(campath-1m) intravenous application monoclonal antibody campath-1g 
prior conditioning monitored virus shedding antigenaemia day
-7 day +100. seropositive patients group active cmv infection
occurred frequently (10 16) much earlier (nine 10 day +21)
than 27 seropositive patients (10 27, p < 0.02) receiving cyclosporin and
methotrexate (csa/mtx). early active cmv infection vivo/ex vivo cell
depletion correlated strictly early increase blood lymphocyte counts
(p < 0.01), predominance nk cells and/or cd8+ cells. three cases of
very early interstitial pneumonitis (ip) occurred vivo/ex vivo cell
depletion compared none csa/mtx group. ip fatal only
patient early active cmv infection, remained lymphocytopenic till death 
on day +31. may indicate early immune response cmv is
possible essential favourable clinical outcome.
