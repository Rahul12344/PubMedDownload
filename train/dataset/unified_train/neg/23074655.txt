an avian influenza virus (aiv), a/turkey/israel/09 subtype h6n1, isolated
from turkey poults exhibiting typical pathology associated aiv infection.
the virus characterized rt-pcr using aiv subtype-specific primers by
the haemagglutination inhibition test using aiv subtype-specific antisera. the
virus intravenous pathogenicity index 0 possessed nucleotide
sequence cleavage site hemagglutinin gene, pqietr*glf, associated
with avian influenza viruses low pathogenicity. unlike two previous h6n2
isolates originating domestic ducks mallard, a/turkey/israel/09
(h6n1) isolated turkeys. gene sequences a/turkey/israel/09
(h6n1) virus show divergence former israeli h6 isolates.
