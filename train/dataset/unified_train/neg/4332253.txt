protein synthesis directed encephalomyocarditis virus rna: properties a
transfer rna-dependent system.

aviv h, boime i, leder p.

small amounts encephalomyocarditis virus rna direct 50-fold increase in
amino acid incorporation, appropriately supplemented ascites tumor cell
extracts, conditions give rise authentic viral polypeptides.
incorporation crude extracts novel characteristic, namely, it
is almost entirely dependent upon addition exogenous trna. further, this
incorporation restricted trna derived ascites tumor cells from
rat liver permits translation viral rna, whereas trna yeast or
escherichia coli not. translational barriers due, least in
part, incompatibility trna yeast e. coli the
aminoacyl-trna synthetases ascites tumor cell. extensive basis 
this incompatibility suggested, however, failure e. coli
aminoacyl-trna synthetases restore viral rna-directed protein synthesis the
presence trna e. coli, although coli synthetases fully restore the
poly(u)-directed synthesis polyphenyl-alanine. possible role unique
or favored codon classes might play restriction considered, together
with implications observed requirement trna.
