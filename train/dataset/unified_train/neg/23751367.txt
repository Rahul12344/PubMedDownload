ebola virus (ebov) causes severe hemorrhagic fever case fatality rates 
up 90%, antiviral therapies available. antiviral screening is
hampered fact development cytopathic effect, easiest means 
detect infection wild-type ebov, relatively slow. overcome this
problem generated recombinant ebov carrying luciferase reporter. using
this virus show ebov entry rapid, viral protein expression
detectable within 2 h infection. further, luminescence-based assays were
developed allow highly sensitive titer determination within 48 h. a
proof-of-concept utility antiviral screening used virus to
assess neutralizing antibodies sirnas, significantly faster screening
times currently available wild-type recombinant viruses. availability
of recombinant virus allow rapid quantitative evaluation
of antivirals ebov, well study details ebov life
cycle.
