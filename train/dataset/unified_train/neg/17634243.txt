the tegument, semiordered matrix proteins overlying nucleocapsid and
underlying virion envelope, viruses gamma subfamily of
herpesviridae poorly understood. murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) a
robust model studying gammaherpesvirus virion structure, assembly, and
composition, mhv-68 efficiently completes lytic phase productively
infects cultured cells. found mhv-68 orf52 encodes abundant
tegument protein conserved among gammaherpesviruses. detergent sensitivity
experiments revealed mhv-68 orf52 protein tightly bound the
virion nucleocapsid orf45 tegument protein could dissociated from
particles retained orf65 small capsomer protein. orf52, tagged with
enhanced green fluorescent protein flag epitope, localized cytoplasm. a
recombinant mhv-68 bacterial artificial chromosome mutant nonsense
mutation incorporated orf52 exhibited viral dna replication, expression of
late lytic genes, capsid assembly packaging levels near the
wild type. however, mhv-68 orf52-null virus deficient assembly and
release infectious virion particles. instead, partially tegumented capsids
produced orf52-null mutant accumulated cytoplasm, containing
conserved capsid proteins, orf64 orf67 tegument proteins, virtually
no orf45 tegument protein. thus, orf52 essential tegumentation and
egress infectious mhv-68 particles cytoplasm, suggesting important
conserved function gammaherpesvirus virion morphogenesis.
