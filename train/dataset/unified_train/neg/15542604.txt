mammalian small heat shock proteins (shsp) form polydisperse dynamic
oligomers undergo equilibrium subunit exchange. current models their
chaperone activity hypothesize recognition binding protein non-native
states involve changes oligomeric state. equivalent thermodynamic
representation set three coupled equilibria includes shsp
oligomeric equilibrium, substrate folding equilibrium, equilibrium
binding shsp substrate non-native states. test this
hypothesis define binding-competent oligomeric state human hsp27, we
have perturbed two former equilibria quantitatively determined the
consequences binding. substrate set t4 lysozyme (t4l) mutants that
bind conditions favor folded state unfolded state by
10(2)-10(4)-fold. concentration-dependent oligomer equilibrium hsp27 was
perturbed mutations alter relative stability two major oligomeric 
states including phosphorylation-mimicking mutations result the
dissociation small multimer wide range concentrations. correlation
of binding isotherms size exclusion chromatography analysis hsp27
oligomer equilibrium demonstrates multimer binding-competent
state. binding occurs two modes, characterized different affinity
and number binding sites, results t4l.hsp27 complexes different
hydrodynamic properties. mutants hsp27 phosphorylation mimic reverse 
the reduction oligomer size also reduce extent t4l binding. taken
together, results suggest central role oligomeric equilibrium 
regulating chaperone activity shsp. mutants identify sequence features
important modulating equilibrium.
