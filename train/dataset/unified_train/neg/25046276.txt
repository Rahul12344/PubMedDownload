recently, avian bornavirus (abv) identified new member the
bornaviridae family consisting solely mammal-infecting borna disease virus
(bdv). here, gain insights evolution bornaviruses, 
time-stamped n gene sequences bdv genotype 1 (bdv1) abv subjected 
bayesian coalescent analyses. nucleotide substitution rates the
divergence times estimated. age calculations suggested first
diversification event analyzed bdv1 isolates might taken place 
300years ago, revealed abv old virus newly recognized. great
differences observed rate nucleotide substitution pattern 
of codon usage bias bdv1 abv. moreover, analyzed bornaviruses
might descended at-rich ancestor.
