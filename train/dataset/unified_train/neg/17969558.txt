stem cell gene therapy approaches held much hope development
of new tools treat disease. therapeutic approaches based methods have
only rarely found way clinic. linking stem cell therapy
with selective gene therapy enhances therapeutic options regeneration 
replacement diseased missing cells. review focuses rationale
and preliminary results combining stem cell gene therapy. special emphasis
is placed various molecular techniques currently used genetically engineer 
stem cells. viral nonviral genes delivering technologies detailed 
techniques modulation gene expression context stem cell
recruitment differentiation. finally potential clinical applications this
new therapeutic strategy discussed.
