nipah virus (niv) hendra virus (hev) recently emerged zoonotic
paramyxoviruses exclusively grouped within new genus, henipavirus. these
viruses cause fatal disease wide range species, including humans. both
niv hev continued re-emerge sporadically bangladesh australia,
respectively. currently therapeutics vaccines available treat 
henipavirus infection classified bsl4 pathogens. rna interference
(rnai) process double-stranded rna directs sequence-specific
degradation messenger rna animal plant cells. small interfering rnas
(sirnas) mediate rnai inhibiting gene expression homologous mrna our
preliminary studies suggest rnai may useful approach developing novel
therapies highly lethal pathogens. eight niv sirna molecules (four l
and four n gene specific), two hev n gene specific, two non-specific control 
sirna molecules designed tested ability inhibit a
henipavirus minigenome replication system (which require use live
virus) addition live virus infections vitro. minigenome assay
three four sirnas targeted l gene niv effectively
inhibited replication. contrast, niv n gene sirnas effective in
reducing live niv replication, suggesting inhibition early, abundantly
expressed gene transcripts may effective later, less abundant
transcripts. additionally, sirnas effective niv infection
were partially effective inhibitors hev infection. inverse correlation
between number nucleotide mismatches efficacy sirna inhibition 
was observed. demonstration rnai effectively inhibits henipavirus
replication vitro, novel approach may provide effective therapy
for highly lethal, zoonotic pathogens.
