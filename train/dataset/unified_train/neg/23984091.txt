the present study aimed investigate protective effect glycyrrhizin
(locally isolated purified licorice root) duck hepatitis virus
through assessment hematological biochemical parameters. one
hundred sixty white pekin ducklings-one day old-were randomly divided into
four equal groups. group (1) kept normal control. group (2) inoculated
i/p 10 mg glycyrrhizin/kg bw, three times per week four weeks. group (3)
was inoculated i/m 0.5 ml live attenuated dhv vaccine. group (4) was
inoculated glycyrrhizin (10 mg/kg bw i/p, three times per week four
weeks) live attenuated dhv vaccine (0.5 ml, i/m). then, groups of
treatment challenged using virulent dhv except 20 ducklings the
normal control group continued kept negative control. the
results revealed duck hepatitis virus (dhv) caused macrocytic hypochromic
anemia, leukopenia, hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia,
hypercholesterolemia, marked elevation liver enzymes renal parameters.
in conclusion, glycyrrhizin injected alone combination dhv vaccine
protected ameliorated deteriorating effects induced dhv vaccine and/or 
duck hepatitis virus infection improvement erythrogram leukogram, as
well liver kidney functions.
