the differentiation antigen t4 present helper/inducer subset t
cells. acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids), lymphocyte subset 
is selectively depleted htlv-iii/lav virus apparently uses t4
antigen viral receptor. autoradiographic visualization t4 antigen
on sections squirrel monkey brain shown reveals heterogeneous pattern
with clustering emotion-mediating regions brain are
usually enriched neuropeptide receptors. immunoprecipitates cell
membranes primate brain indicate antigen similar t4 is
present brain t4+ lymphocytes. since patients aids frequently
develop complications central nervous system htlv-iii/lav sequences
have found brain, data suggest direct infection some
brain cells htlv-iii/lav occurs via mechanism involving t4 antigen
complex similar proposed lymphocyte infection. view brain
sites found express t4-like antigen, behavioral changes mood
shifts observed aids patients may result localized viral replication.
