background: squamous cell carcinoma anal canal provides model for
studying contribution human papillomavirus (hpv) human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection development neoplasia. this
paper reviews existing literature relating molecular biology anal
squamous cell carcinoma proposes theory pathogenesis.
methods: medline literature search performed identify english articles
on pathogenesis squamous cell carcinoma anus; articles were
obtained references quoted literature initially reviewed.
results: hpv infection subsequent hpv dna integration necessary, 
sufficient, cause cancer progression. loss heterozygosity 11q23 the
most consistent genomic change observed. loss heterozygosity 17p, 18q and
5q frequently observed tumours hiv-negative patients, those
of hiv-positive patients. current data suggest mutations p53, dcc apc
tumour suppressor genes contribute stepwise progression anal squamous
cell carcinoma immunocompetent individuals.
conclusion: comparison immunocompetent individuals, hiv-positive patients
have persistent hpv infection anal canal. population,
microsatellite instability, rather chromosomal instability, appears 
preferred pathway rapid progression towards invasive carcinoma.
