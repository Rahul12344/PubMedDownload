background: micrornas (mirnas) group regulatory rnas regulate gene 
expression binding specific sequences target mrnas. however, functional 
identification mrna targets usually difficult time consuming. we
report hybrid-pcr new rapid approach screen putative mrna targets 
vitro.
results: fifteen putative target mrnas human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)
mir-ul112-1, including previously confirmed hcmv ie72, identified from
mrna-derived cdnas using hybrid-pcr. moreover, randomly validated six
different target candidates luciferase reporter assays, confirmed that
their luciferase activities down-regulated co-transfection hcmv
mir-ul112-1.
conclusions: study demonstrated hybrid-pcr effective rapid
approach screening putative mirna targets, much advantage of
simplicity, low cost, ease implementation.
