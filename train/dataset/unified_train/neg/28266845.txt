infection assay derive comprehensive structure-activity relationship (sar). 
two compounds, nbd-14088 nbd-14107, showed significant improvement
in antiviral activity compared lead entry antagonist single-cycle
assay large panel env-pseudotyped viruses. x-ray structure 
similar compound, nbd-14010, confirmed binding mode newly designed
compounds. vitro admet profiles compounds comparable 
of potent attachment inhibitor bms-626529, prodrug is
currently undergoing phase iii clinical trials. systematic study presented
here expected pave way improving potency, toxicity, admet
profile series compounds potential moved early
