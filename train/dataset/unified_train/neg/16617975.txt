an avian poxvirus cutaneous lesions hawaiian goose (branta
sandvicensis) characterized study. virus isolated by
inoculation onto chorioallantoic membranes (cams) developing chicken
embryos. cytoplasmic inclusion bodies observed histopathological
examination cam lesions. western blotting analysis using polyclonal antiserum 
against fowl poxvirus (fwpv) showed differences fwpv, similar
antigenic profile hawaiian goosepox (hgp) isolate two previous
hawaiian poxvirus isolates observed. still three avian poxviruses from
hawaiian birds showed distinguishable reaction approximately 27, 34, 35, and
81 kda proteins polyclonal antibodies hawaiian poxvirus isolate 
(alala/lanakila) used. restriction fragment length polymorphisms (rflp) of
dna isolate also showed differences fwpv previous
avianpox isolates hawaiian forest birds. nucleotide sequences a
5.3-kb psti-hindiii fragment genome hgp isolate revealed high
homology (99% identities) canary poxvirus (cnpv) orf266-274, like cnpv, 
homologs three fwpv orfs (199, 200, 202) including any
reticuloendotheliosis virus (rev) sequences present genome hgp 
isolate.
