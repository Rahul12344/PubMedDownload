adenoid basal tumors uncommon cervical lesions pathologists
consider invasive carcinomas others consider "epitheliomas" due their
low-grade histological appearance rarely documented malignant behavior. we
report clinicopathologic features 10 tumors comprised typical
low-grade adenoid basal tumors (epitheliomas) intimately associated invasive
carcinomas infiltrative growth, increased cytological atypia mitotic
activity, various types differentiation, including adenoid basal/squamous,
pure squamous, adenoid cystic, small cell neuroendocrine. tumors were
evaluated presence human papillomavirus (hpv) dna and
immunohistochemical p16 expression. patients study group ranged age
from 45 81 years (mean, 65 years). patients presented with
abnormal cervicovaginal smears. initial diagnosis made specimens
obtained cervical biopsy, laser electrocautery excision procedure (leep), or
cone biopsy 8 patients. two 2 patients incidentally diagnosed in
hysterectomy specimens. 10 patients squamous intraepithelial lesions (9
high-grade, 1 low-grade). cases diagnosed leep cone biopsy
specimens, invasive carcinoma component present excisional
specimen extended margins. seven patients diagnosed excisional or
biopsy specimens underwent hysterectomy residual tumor cervix,
ranging microscopic foci deeply invasive. lymph node metastases were
identified 4 patients staged. seven patients follow-up were
alive without evidence disease follow-up intervals 8 84 months
(mean, 45 months; median, 29 months). one patient component small cell 
carcinoma died causes without evidence disease 18 months. hpv 16
dna detected adenoid basal epithelioma invasive carcinoma
components 9 tumors situ hybridization, hpv 33 detected by
polymerase chain reaction 1 tumor. tumors expressed p16 diffusely. adenoid
basal tumors high-risk hpv-related tumors comprised a
low-grade adenoid basal tumor, designated epithelioma, and
invasive carcinomas various types. invasive component usually evident
in excisional biopsy specimen, allowing recognition tumor needs
further management.
