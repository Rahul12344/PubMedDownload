background: microbicide toxicity may reduce efficacy topical preexposure
prophylaxis human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) transmission. noninvasive
quantitative measures microbicide toxicity would usefully inform microbicide
development.
methods: ten subjects received 3 one-time interventions: 5 ml normosol-r fluid
alone (negative control), 5 ml 2% nonoxynol-9 (n-9) gel, 5 ml of
normosol-r coital simulation sigmoidoscopic biopsy (cs + bx). dose 
of n-9 normosol-r contained 500 Âµci (99m)technetium-diethylene triamine
pentaacetic acid. plasma urine radioactivity assessed 24 hours.
results: plasma radioisotope concentration peaked 1 hour n-9 dosing.
the mean maximum radioisotope concentration n-9 receipt 12.0 times (95%
confidence interval [ci], 6.8-21.0) 8.4 times (95% ci, 5.2-13.5) mean
concentration normosol-r control receipt cs + bx receipt, respectively;
paired differences persisted 24 hours. n-9 dosing, urine isotope
level 3.6 times (95% ci, 1.1-11.4) level observed 8 hours after
normosol-r control receipt 4.0 times (95% ci, 1.4-11.4) level observed 4 
hours cs + bx receipt. permeability cs + bx receipt greater 
that normosol-r control receipt 0-2-hour urine specimens (mean
permeability, 2.4; 95% ci, 1.0-5.8) greater blood.
conclusions: plasma sampling rectal radioisotope administration provided
quantitative estimates altered mucosal permeability chemical and
mechanical stresses. permeability testing may provide useful noninvasive
adjunct assess mucosal effects candidate microbicides. clinical trials
