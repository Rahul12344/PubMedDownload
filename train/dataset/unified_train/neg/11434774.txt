the 5' noncoding region picornaviral genome begins cloverleaf which
is required viral replication, due least part interaction with
the viral rna polymerase part fusion predominant viral protease.
the necessary region cloverleaf previously narrowed highly
conserved stem-loop. solution structure 14-nucleotide rna hairpin, which
is part conserved stem-loop human rhinovirus isotype 14, presented
here. secondary structure hairpin identical predictions: five 
base pair stem bounded triloop sequence uau. however, fold of
the triloop novel, stacking second loop base onto closing base
pair stem, deviations form geometry introduced the
stem regions bordering triloop, particularly 3' side. deviations
and associated triloop structure could help explain distinct sequence 
conservation mutational analysis data observed stem region the
hairpin, compared second sequentially similar stem intact
stem-loop.
