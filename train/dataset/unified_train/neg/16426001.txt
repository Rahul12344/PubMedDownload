dengue fever mosquito-borne viral disease prevalent mainly tropical
countries. clinical manifestations dengue unique,
laboratory diagnosis crucial identifying cases dengue infection.
detection dengue infection based identification antidengue
antibodies emerged practical reliable means diagnosing dengue
fever. recently developed customized recombinant dengue multiepitope protein
(r-dme-g) specifically detect immunoglobulin g (igg) class of
antidengue antibodies patient sera. using strategy, created
another dengue multiepitope protein, r-dme-m, specificity igm class 
of antidengue antibodies. synthetic gene encoding r-dme-m protein was
expressed maltose-binding protein fusion escherichia coli. the
recombinant protein purified single affinity chromatographic step to
obtain yields approximately 15 mg purified protein/liter culture. the
purified protein used develop in-house igm enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (elisa) tested using panel 172 patient sera characterized using
the commercially available dengue duo rapid strip test panbio, australia.
the igm elisa results showed r-dme-m protein recognized all
igm(+) samples identified panbio test also identified samples missed
by latter test. also successfully adapted r-dme-m protein rapid
strip test format. approach creating customized antigens coupled to
overexpression e. coli simple purification offers promising alternative 
option dengue diagnosis potential circumvent drawbacks 
whole virus antigen-based commercial kits.
