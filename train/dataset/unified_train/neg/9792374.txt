objective: decreased t-cell reactivity vitro strongly associated with
progression aids low cd4+ t-cell numbers. low t-cell responses vitro
induced cd3 monoclonal antibody (mab) predictive progression aids
independent low cd4+ t-cell counts high hiv-1 rna levels. developed a
whole-blood lymphocyte culture system cells stimulated a
combination cd3 cd28 mab. combined stimulation cd28, costimulatory
molecule, cd3 considerably enhances t-cell responses vitro reduces
variation coefficients, may increase prognostic power t-cell
responses.
design: prospective study hiv-1-infected homosexual men followed 35
months.
methods: predictive value low t-cell responses cd3 plus cd28 mab
relative low cd4+ t-cell counts, high hiv-1 rna levels presence of
syncytium-inducing (si) hiv-1 variants evaluated longitudinally 202
hiv-1-infected homosexual men followed 35 months.
results: multivariate analysis, decreased t-cell responses baseline were
predictive development aids, independent low cd4+ t-cell numbers and
high hiv-1 rna levels. time-dependent model, hiv-1 rna levels lost their
predictive value, whereas low t-cell responses, low cd4+ t-cell numbers the
presence si hiv-1 variants independently predicted aids.
conclusions: data demonstrate combined use virological and
immunological markers may useful monitoring disease progression and
response antiretroviral therapy.
