the replication enzyme rna viruses must preferentially recognize rnas in
an environment contains abundance cellular rnas. factors
responsible specific rna recognition well understood, part because
viral rna synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated modified 
cellular membrane compartments. recombinant rna-dependent rna polymerases (rdrps)
from human norovirus murine norovirus (mnv) found to
preferentially recognize rna segments contain promoter short
template sequence subgenomic rna synthesis. promoter template
sequence contribute stable rdrp binding, accurate initiation subgenomic
rnas efficient rna synthesis. using method combines rna crosslinking
and mass spectrometry, residues near template channel mnv rdrp were
found contact hairpin rna motif. mutations hairpin contact site 
the mnv rdrp reduced mnv replication virus production cells. work
demonstrates specific recognition norovirus subgenomic promoter
is binding viral rdrp.
