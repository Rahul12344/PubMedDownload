antiviral assays carried potent benzothiadiazine dioxide (btd) human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv) inhibitors led us find marginal selective
anti-hiv-1 activity. specific pharmacological studies, time addition
experiments assays specific viral strains mutations reverse
transcriptase, indicated btd compounds act non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. theoretical calculations showed butterfly
conformation active derivatives compatible mechanism 
of action. therefore, btd derivatives considered potential lead
compounds treatment opportunistic hcmv infections immunocompromised
individuals aids patients.
