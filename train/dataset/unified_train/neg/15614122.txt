goal: goal study evaluate seroprevalence human
herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) infection among hiv-infected individuals brazil and
the associated risk factors.
study: cross-sectional survey carried 497 hiv/aids outpatients
attending local aids reference center santos (southeastern brazil) between
february 1997 january 1998 serum samples screened anti-hhv-8
antibodies. patients considered seropositive whenever reactivity was
observed least 1 3 tests (immunofluorescence assays latent nuclear
and lytic antigens orf65 recombinant antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay).
results: overall hhv-8 seroprevalence 13.9% (95% confidence interval [ci],
10.9-17.6). hhv-8 coinfection significantly frequent men (18.7%; 95% 
ci, 14.1-23.4) women (7.8%; 95% ci, 4.2-11.3) (p < 0.001). according to
the mode hiv acquisition among males, seroprevalence hhv-8 infection was
significantly higher men sex men compared other
groups (32.4% vs. 10.0%, p < 0.001). multivariate logistic regression revealed
hhv-8 infection among men independently associated sexual orientation 
(adjusted odds ratio [aor], 5.5 homosexuals; aor, 2.8 bisexuals). no
significant risk factor hhv-8 infection could demonstrated for
hiv-infected women cohort,
conclusions: study provides evidence men sex men 
are higher risk hhv-8 infection shows epidemiologic pattern of
this infection among hiv/aids patients santos, brazil, similar that
described countries low incidence kaposi's sarcoma.
