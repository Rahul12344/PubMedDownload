complement receptor ii (cd21) receptor c3d fragments immune
complexes. also serves receptor epstein-barr virus (ebv) on
b-lymphocytes cd21 amplifies signalling b cell receptor. cd21 shed
from surface cell found circulating plasma. there, soluble
cd21 (scd21) binds cd23 complement fragments, thereby modulating the
immune response. scd21 activates monocytes binding membrane cd23. 
clinical significance scd21 shown increased levels found sera
of patients b lymphomas, ebv infections lymphoblastoid tumors. 
this paper, report isolation soluble cd21 human plasma using
affinity chromatography density gradient centrifugation. scd21 found to
be single 126 kda molecular species. determining sedimentation
coefficient, calculated partial specific volume, diffusion
coefficient frictional coefficient protein. values show the
scd21 isolated human plasma elongated rod-shaped molecule.
