development preliminary assessment recombinant canarypox virus an
antirabic vaccine candidate. argentina, rabies limited northern
provinces. availability new vaccines abolishing handling rabies
virus allowing disease control regional national strategic
importance. vaccines based recombinant poxviruses successfully used 
as antirabic vaccines worldwide. although systems commercially
available, platform obtain recombinant canarypox viruses (cnpv) been
previously set laboratory. aim work development and
evaluation antirabic vaccine candidate based recombinant cnpv expressing
the rabies virus (rv) glycoprotein g (rg). recombinant virus (cnpv-rg)
expressing rg coding sequence designed. inoculation mice this
virus induced high rv seroneutralizing antibodies (3.58 9.76 iu/ml 1 or
2 immunizations, respectively) protected 78% intracerebrally rv-challenged
animals. addition, determined cnpv-rg relative potency of
3.5 iu/ml. obtained results constituted first stage cnpv-rg evaluation
as antirabic vaccine candidate. assays necessary confirm its
utility species veterinary interest.
