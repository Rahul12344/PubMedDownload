differential phosphorylation (e)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine
monophosphate thymidylate kinases herpes simplex viruses types 1 2
and varicella zoster virus.

5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (brvdurd) potent selective inhibitor of
herpes simplex virus type (hs-i) varicella zoster (vz) virus replication
but much less potent herpes simplex virus type ii (hs-ii) replication.
a possible enzymatic basis difference reported involve the
virus-coded dthd-dtmp kinases (ec 2.7.1.75) three virus strains. the
thymidine kinases three virus strains purified affinity
chromatography. addition catalyzing phosphorylation nucleosides,
each three purified enzymes catalyzed phosphorylation thymidylate
to diphosphate strikingly different rates. relative amounts of
extractable virus-coded thymidylate kinases estimated 100/2/40 for
cells infected hs-i, hs-ii, vz viruses, respectively. extracts cells 
infected hs-i virus catalyzed phosphorylation monophosphate of
brvdurd diphosphate. contrast, product detected with
extracts cells infected hs-ii virus. ratios rates 0.5 mm
brvdurd monophosphate versus 0.1 mm dtmp substrates purified
dthd-dtmp kinases hs-i, hs-ii, vz viruses dtmp kinase host 
cells were, respectively, 0.09, less 0.002, 0.03, less 0.0002.
these observations correlate relative sensitivities viruses 
brvdurd cell culture suggest that, brvdurd exerts effect a
triphosphate, inefficient phosphorylation monophosphate contributes to
the insensitivity hs-ii virus agent.
