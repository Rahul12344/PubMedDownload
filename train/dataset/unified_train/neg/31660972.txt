background: fowl adenovirus outbreaks occurred china since june 2015.
this virus emerging infectious disease causes hydropericardium
syndrome inclusion body hepatitis (hps-ibh), resulting significant
economic loss poultry farmers. five fowl adenovirus (fadv) strains (hn, aq,
ah726, js07 ah712) isolated jiangsu anhui provinces.
results: phylogenetic analysis revealed five isolates belonged to
species c fowl adenovirus serotype 4. 11 amino-acid deletion orf29,
relative older viral isolate, jsj13, observed five strains
described here. chicken experiments, 80-100% birds died intramuscular
inoculation displayed lesions characteristic hps-ibh. viral dna copies
were detected hexon-probe based real-time polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) chicken samples. viral loads cytokine profiles recorded
in organs infections. despite minor genetic differences, 5
strains displayed significantly different tissue tropisms cytokine profiles.
conclusions: data enhance current understanding factors
involved pathogenicity genetic diversity fadv serotype 4
(fadv-4) china. work provides theoretical support prevention and
control hps-ibh chickens.
