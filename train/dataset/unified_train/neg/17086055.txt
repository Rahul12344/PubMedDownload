objective: assess efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetic interactions of
ezetimibe hiv-infected patients poorly controlled
antiretroviral-associated dyslipidaemia taking pravastatin alone.
design: prospective, open-label, one-arm study 24 weeks duration.
patients setting: nineteen patients (18 stable haart), low density
lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol values > = 130 mg/dl despite use of
pravastatin.
methods: ezetimibe, 10 mg/day, added pravastatin 20 mg/day, patients
maintained antiretroviral regimen. determinations total, ldl-, and
high density lipoprotein (hdl)-cholesterol, triglycerides, apoproteins, and
inflammatory factors (homocystein c-reactive protein) performed at
baseline, weeks 6, 12, 24. liver enzymes creatinine phosphokinase 
were also assessed. protease inhibitor (pi) non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (nnrti) cmin determined 12 weeks
after ezetimibe introduction.
results: week 24, 61.5% patients achieved endpoint study
(ldl-cholesterol < 130 mg/dl). significant declines mean total and
ldl-cholesterol levels observed baseline weeks 6, 12, 24,
irrespective antiretroviral type (pi nnrti). mean hdl-cholesterol and
apoprotein increased significantly. patients discontinued therapy due to
intolerance presented toxicity grade 2 more. differences were
observed lopinavir nevirapine cmin measured 12 weeks 
ezetimibe introduction.
conclusion: addition ezetimibe ongoing pravastatin seems an
effective safe option hiv-infected patients achieving ncep atpiii
ldl-cholesterol goals receiving statin alone. high tolerability and
the lack interactions cytochrome cyp3a4 indicate ezetimibe 
not increase risk toxicity pharmacokinetic interactions with
antiretrovirals.
