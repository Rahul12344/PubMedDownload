purpose: use coital-dependent products prevent hiv-1 transmission has
resulted mixed success. hypothesize incorporation antiviral drug
candidates novel controlled delivery system prolong activity,
making use coital independent, thus increasing chance prophylactic
success.
methods: tenofovir, emtricitabine, c5a peptide hiv microbicides were
mechanically incorporated matrices comprising series subliming solids. 
matrix sublimation rates drug release rates measured three vitro
and one vivo environments intended model human vaginal interior. antiviral 
activity studies evaluating matrix incorporated microbicides performed using
in vitro cell cultures human ectocervical explants.
results: drug release rates identical matrix sublimation rates, 
zero order. differences matrix material sublimation enthalpies determined drug
release matrix erosion rates thermodynamically definable manner, in
vitro vivo. durations release ranging several days several
months readily achieved. prolonged duration anti hiv-1 activity shown
for matrix incorporated microbicides, using ectocervical explant cell culture
models hiv-1 infection.
conclusion: subliming solid matrices show promise delivery system providing 
multi month intravaginal release wide range hiv-1 microbicides.
