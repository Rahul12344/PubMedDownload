serum sex hormone-binding globulin (shbg), testosterone, non-shbg-bound
testosterone, androstenedione, dihydrotestosterone (dht), dehydroepiandrosterone 
(dhea), follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh), luteinizing hormone (lh) cortisol
were measured 58 homosexual men seropositive human immunodeficiency virus 
(hiv), clinically asymptomatic (centers disease control 1993
classification stage a). hiv patients divided four groups according
to cd4 lymphocyte count--group 1 (more 500/microliters, n = 14), group 2
(between 350 500/microliters, n = 16), group 3 (between 200 and
349/microliters, n = 22) group 4 (less 200/microliters, n = 6)--and
compared 11 antibody-negative men controls. shbg levels were
significantly increased groups 1, 2, 3 (p < 0.01) 4 (p < 0.05) compared
with controls, differences groups patients. compared with
controls, testosterone concentrations significantly lower group 4 (p <
0.05) non-shbg-bound testosterone levels significantly lower groups 1
(p < 0.05), 2 (p < 0.01), 3 (p < 0.001) group 4 (p < 0.001); dht and
androstenedione levels significantly lower group 4 (p < 0.05) dhea
levels significantly lower group 2, group 3 (p < 0.01) group 4 (p <
0.05) controls. cortisol levels significantly increased groups 1 
and 4 (p < 0.05) fsh lh concentrations significantly higher in
hiv-infected men controls. also, dhea, androstenedione,
non-shbg-bound testosterone dht levels correlated cd4 cell counts, 
showing hypogonadism occurs cd4 lymphocytes decrease.(abstract
