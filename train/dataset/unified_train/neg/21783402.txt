we present common cytogenetic features largest cohort plasmablastic
lymphoma (pbl) oral cavity published date. cohort included 45
patients, 32 known hiv status, 31 hiv positive.
ninety eight per cent pbl cases known ebv positive. line
with previous studies, found rearrangements myc gene 
common genetic abnormality seen 60% cases immunoglobulin heavy
chain (igh) locus partner 51% cases. additional complex genetic
aberrations frequent, particular, increased copy number ccnd1
gene seen 41% cases true amplification ccnd1 15% cases.
aneuploidy also observed bcl6 gene 28% cases. interestingly,
rearrangements igh genes detected 16% cases t(14;18) 
t(11;14) respectively involved conjunction t(8;14) two cases. 
bi-allelic igh rearrangements described oral pbl. our
results reinforce notion ebv infection myc rearrangements are
important events pathogenesis oral pbl. genetic diversity and
complexity observed cases, underlines importance genetically
characterise pbl patients presentation may inform choice more
effective treatment modalities.
