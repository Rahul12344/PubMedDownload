hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection major cause chronic liver disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. furthermore, hcv-induced liver disease a
major indication liver transplantation. past years, direct-acting
antivirals (daas) targeting hcv enzymes developed. daas increase the
virologic response anti-hcv therapy may lead selection of
drug-resistant variants treatment failure. date, strategies prevent hcv
infection still lacking antiviral therapy immunocompromised patients, 
patients advanced liver disease hiv/hcv-co-infection remains limited.
alternative complementary approaches addressing limitations current
antiviral therapies boost host's innate immunity interfere with
host factors required pathogenesis. host-targeting agents (htas) provide an
interesting perspective novel antiviral strategies viral hepatitis
since (i) high genetic barrier resistance, (ii) pan-genotypic
antiviral activity, (iii) complementary mechanisms action daas and
might therefore act synergistic manner current standard care daas
in clinical development. review highlights htas hcv infection that
have potential novel antivirals preclinical clinical
development.
