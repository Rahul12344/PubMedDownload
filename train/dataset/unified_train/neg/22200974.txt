introduction: study conducted investigate mri associated clinical
characteristics brainstem encephalitis induced enterovirus 71 (ev71) in
children hand-foot-mouth disease (hfmd).
methods: analyzed clinical imaging data 42 hfmd cases with
ev71-induced brainstem encephalitis. patients underwent plain enhanced
mri cranial scans placed one two groups according mri
enhancement results, enhanced group nonenhanced group.
results: thirty-two cases positive mri exam. primary location 
lesion brainstem encephalitis dorsal pons medulla oblongata (32
cases), followed cerebellar dentate nucleus (8 cases), midbrain (5 cases),
and thalamus (2 cases). plain t1-weighted images showed isointense hypointense
signals, t2-weighted images showed isointense hyperintense signals.
enhanced mri scans showed 12 cases slight moderate enhancement; 4 
these normal plain scan. time mri examination disease onset
was statistically different enhanced (n = 12) nonenhanced
(n = 21) groups mean 7.67 days (sd = 1.07) vs 11.95 days (sd = 5.33),
respectively. common neurological symptoms brainstem encephalitis
were myoclonus tremor. greater area affected brain, more
severe clinical symptoms were.
conclusion: locations ev71-induced hfmd-associated brainstem encephalitis 
lesions relatively specific. enhanced mri scans could also identify the
lesions missed early plain scans. mri scans provide important information 
for clinical evaluation treatment.
