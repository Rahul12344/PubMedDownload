the p6 region hiv-1 gag contains two late (l) domains, ptap lypx(n)l, that
bind tsg101 alix, respectively. interactions two cellular proteins
recruit members host's fission machinery (escrt) facilitate hiv-1
release. retroviruses gain access host escrt components utilizing
a ppxy-type l domain interacts cellular nedd4-like ubiquitin ligases.
despite absence ppxy motif hiv-1 gag, interaction ubiquitin 
ligase nedd4-2 recently shown stimulate hiv-1 release. show that
another nedd4-like ubiquitin ligase, nedd4-1, corrected release defects resulting
from disruption ptap (ptap(-)), suggesting hiv-1 gag also recruits
nedd4-1 facilitate virus release. notably, nedd4-1 remediation hiv-1
ptap(-) budding defects independent cellular tsg101, implying that
nedd4-1's function hiv-1 release involve escrt-i components is
therefore distinct nedd4-2. consistent finding, deletion
of p6 region decreased nedd4-1-gag interaction, disruption the
lypx(n)l motif eliminated nedd4-1-mediated restoration hiv-1 ptap(-). this
result indicated nedd4-1 interaction gag function virus
release occur alix-binding lypx(n)l motif. mutations basic
residues located nc domain gag critical alix's
facilitation hiv-1 release, also disrupted release mediated nedd4-1,
further confirming nedd4-1-alix functional interdependence. fact found
that nedd4-1 binds alix immunoprecipitation yeast-two-hybrid assays. 
in addition, nedd4-1 requires catalytic activity promote virus release.
remarkably, rnai knockdown cellular nedd4-1 eliminated alix ubiquitination 
the cell impeded ability function hiv-1 release. together data 
support model alix recruits nedd4-1 facilitate hiv-1 release
mediated lypx(n)l/alix budding pathway via mechanism involves 
alix ubiquitination.
