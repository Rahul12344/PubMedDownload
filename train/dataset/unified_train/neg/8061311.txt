to determine effect nerve growth factor (ngf) neurotoxicity of
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) vivo, direct intrastriatal injection of
hsv-1 rats followed continuous intracerebral infusion ngf vehicle
solution 7 days. mean volume hsv-1-mediated brain tissue destruction
in ngf-treated animals significantly smaller vehicle-treated
animals 1 week. immunohistochemical staining hsv-1 confirmed presence 
of cells harboring virus primary site injection secondary
sites distant spread, significant difference hsv-1 distribution
between ngf- vehicle-treated animals. conclude intrastriatal infusion
of ngf locally protects hsv-1-mediated neurolysis, affect
hsv-1 dissemination brain.
