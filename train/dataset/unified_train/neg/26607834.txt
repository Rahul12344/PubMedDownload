many coronaviruses capable interspecies transmission. have
caused worldwide panic emerging human pathogens recent years, e.g., severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) middle east respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov). order assess threat humans, we
explored infer potential hosts coronaviruses using dual-model
approach based nineteen parameters computed spike genes coronaviruses.
