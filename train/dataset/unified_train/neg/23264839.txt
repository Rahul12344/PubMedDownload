since first tests identifying individuals suspected human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection introduced mid-1980s,
diagnostic virology testing greatly evolved. technological advances,
automating laboratories advances molecular biology techniques
have helped introduce invaluable laboratory methods managing hiv patients.
tests diagnosis, specially screening hiv antibodies, fully
automated; way, tests monitoring hiv viral load (hiv rna
copies/ml plasma), used monitoring infection response to
antiretroviral treatment, also fully automated; however, resistance testing, 
tropism determination minor variant detection, used make
decisions changing antiretroviral treatment regimens patients failing
therapy, still remain highly laborious time consuming. chapter will
review main aspects relating automating methods available for
laboratory diagnosis well monitoring hiv infection and
determination resistance antiretrovirals viral tropism.
