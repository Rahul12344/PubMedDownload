in spite intense efforts vaccine yet available protects against
lentiviral infections. sheep immunised eight times period 2.5
years maedi-visna (mvv) gag gene two different vectors, 2 sheep 
vr1012-gag-cte 2 sheep pcdna3.1-gag-cte. sheep responded 
the mature mvv gag proteins western blot (wb). three responded 
virus lymphocyte proliferation test. sheep received boost with
recombinant gag protein resulting elevated antibody response. however, when
they challenged intratracheally mvv became immediately
infected judged strong rise antibody titer virus isolation from
blood. therefore clear vaccination gave protection. even 
possible facilitated infectivity since virus isolated earlier from
all vaccinated sheep unvaccinated sheep infected 
same way dose.
