objective: objective study assess nevirapine (nvp) resistance
in infants became infected three arms breastfeeding,
antiretrovirals nutrition (ban) study: daily infant nvp prophylaxis, triple
maternal antiretrovirals extra intervention 28 weeks breastfeeding.
design: prospective cohort study.
methods: latest available plasma dried blood spot specimen tested from
infants became hiv-positive 3 48 weeks age. population
sequencing used detect mutations associated reverse transcriptase
inhibitor resistance. sequences obtained 22 25 transmissions 
the infant-nvp arm, 23 30 transmissions maternal-antiretroviral arm
and 33 38 transmissions control arm.
results: hiv-infected infants infant-nvp arm significantly more
likely nvp resistance infected infants two arms 
trial, especially breastfeeding 28 weeks age (56% infant-nvp
arm vs. 6% maternal-antiretroviral arm 11% control arm, pÂ¼0.004). there
was nonsignificant trend, suggesting infants nvp resistance tended to
be infected earlier exposed nvp infected greater duration than
infants without resistance.
conclusion: infants nvp prophylaxis breastfeeding reduced risk
of acquiring hiv, increased risk nvp resistance do
become infected. findings point need frequent hiv testing of
infants nvp prophylaxis, availability antiretroviral
regimens excluding nvp treating infants become infected a
prophylactic regimen.
