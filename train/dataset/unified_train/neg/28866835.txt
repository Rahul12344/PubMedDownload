in study, successfully produced vlps derived full-length chimeric
vp1 documented gii.6 strain. trypsin digestion purified vlps led total
cleavage vp1, integrity assembled vlps affected. vitro
vlp-histo-blood group antigen (hbga) binding binding blockade assays
indicated trypsin digestion enhanced binding gii.6 vlps salivary
hbgas binding could blocked serum produced a
homologous strain. data regarding assembly, morphology binding
patterns gii.6 nov vlps presented might useful study of
gii.6 novs.
