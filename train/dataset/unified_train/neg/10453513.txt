our previous studies showed ex vivo transfer human il-2 gene murine 
b16 melanoma cells resulted expression il-2 activity inhibitory
effect tumor growth vivo. study, b16 melanoma bearing mice were
injected directly il-2 recombinant pa317 cells. vivo gene transfer
revealed significant reduction tumor size prolongation survival of
tumor bearing mice. using slot blot analysis, expression il-2 mrna in
tumor mass detected ifn gamma activity also enhanced gene
transferred mice. results indicated vivo direct transfer il-2
recombinant retrovirual vector producing cells would induce transfer gene into
tumor cells exert antitumor effect.
