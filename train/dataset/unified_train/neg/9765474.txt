nf-kappab key regulator innate antiviral immune response, due part
to transcriptional activation cytokines adhesion molecules, which, 
turn, function chemotaxis activation inflammatory cells. reported
earlier viral gene expression hepatocytes transduced with
first-generation (e1-deleted) adenoviruses induced nf-kappab activation,
elevation serum cytokines, hepatocellular apoptosis first days 
postinfusion. events occur mice infused adenovirus
vector deleted e1, e2, e3, late gene expression. present study, we
used adenovirus expressing ikappabalpha supersuppressor (ad.ikappabm) and
bcl-2 transgenic mice unravel role virus-induced nf-kappab activation
and apoptosis clearance recombinant adenovirus vectors liver. 
the combined action ikappabm bcl-2 allowed vector persistence in
livers c57bl/6 x c3h mice. absence bcl-2, ikappabm expression in
mouse livers significantly reduced nf-kappab activation, cytokine expression,
leukocyte infiltration, humoral immune response transgene
product; however, sufficient prevent decline vector dna in
transduced cells. infusion ad.ikappabm caused extended apoptosis predominantly
in periportal liver regions, indicating nf-kappab activation may protect
transduced hepatocytes apoptosis induced adenovirus gene products. to
confer vector persistence, bcl-2 transgene expression required block
virus-induced apoptosis nf-kappab protection inactivated ikappabm.
expression gene products involved early stages apoptotic pathways was
up-regulated response virus infusion bcl-2 transgenic mice, may
represent compensatory effect. study supports idea suppression
of innate defense mechanisms improves vector persistence.
