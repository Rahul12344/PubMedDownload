this work describes application sodium dodecyl sulfate-capillary gel
electrophoresis (sds-cge) method analysis triple 2/6/7 and
double-layered 2/6 rotavirus-like particles (rlps), candidate vaccines against
rotavirus infection. sds-cge analysis rlps resulted peaks could be
attributed viral proteins (vp2, vp6 vp7) according apparent
molecular mass (mwapp). samples containing glycoprotein vp7 analysed
after deglycosylation pngase f. upon deglycosylation, vp7 mwapp decreased
4-7kda consistent degree glycosylation approximately 12-21%. vp2 was
eventually detected form one related proteins, despite the
small areas due relative low mass proportion protein the
particle (16%). effect analytical parameters capillary temperature
on method performance evaluated. mwapp values estimated sds-cge were
compared values obtained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry. method described work proved fast,
consistent reproducible, representing feasible alternative laborious
conventional electrophoresis characterization rlps.
