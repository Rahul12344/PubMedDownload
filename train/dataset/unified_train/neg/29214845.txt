hiv-1 rna level strongly associated hiv transmission risk. sought to
determine whether hiv-1 rna level associated prior knowledge hiv
status among treatment-naive hiv-infected individuals botswana, country with
high rates antiretroviral treatment (art) coverage. information may be
helpful targeting hiv diagnosis treatment efforts similar high hiv
prevalence settings population-based survey. hiv-infected individuals were
identified household survey performed 30 communities across botswana.
art-naive persons detectable hiv-1 rna (>400 copies/ml) divided into
two groups, newly diagnosed individuals tested past knew about
their hiv infection time household visit, taken art. levels
of hiv-1 rna compared groups, overall age gender. among
815 hiv-infected art-naive persons detectable virus, newly diagnosed
individuals higher levels hiv-1 rna (n = 490, median hiv-1 rna 4.35,
interquartile range (iqr) 3.79-4.91 log10 copies/ml) knew about
their hiv-positive status (n = 325, median hiv-1 rna 4.10, iqr 3.55-4.68 log10
copies/ml; p values <.001, p value = .011 adjusting age and
gender). nonsignificant trend higher hiv-1 rna found among newly
diagnosed men 30 years age older (median hiv-1 rna 4.58, iqr 4.07-5.02
log10 copies/ml vs. 4.17, 3.61-4.71 log10 copies/ml). newly diagnosed individuals
have elevated levels hiv-1 rna. study highlights need early
diagnosis treatment hiv infection purposes hiv epidemic control,
even setting high art coverage.
