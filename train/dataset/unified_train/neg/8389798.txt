infection human cells poliovirus leads modification phospholipase
activity. phospholipase c, generates inositol triphosphate, stimulated, 
whereas activation phospholipase a2 calcium ionophore a23187 is
inhibited. analysis phospholipid moieties media hela cells infected with
poliovirus indicates release fatty acids enhanced during
infection, suggesting phospholipase a1 a2 activities stimulated.
the release choline medium significantly higher 3 h after
infection, indicating phospholipase phosphatidylcholine its
substrate becomes activated. activation requires viral gene expression
because inhibitors poliovirus gene expression added beginning of
infection block choline release, continuous viral protein synthesis not
required. choline phosphorylcholine released medium, the
pools gradually depleted poliovirus-infected cells, perhaps a
consequence release medium increased synthesis of
phospholipids takes place poliovirus-infected cells. inhibitors of
phospholipase activity mepacrine, zinc cadmium ions significantly
reduce increased release choline poliovirus-infected cells.
labelling cells [3h]phosphatidylcholine suggests choline
released infected cells comes, least part, hydrolysis this
compound. results indicate that, addition activation the
phospholipase c hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol poliovirus-infected
cells, phospholipase c acts phosphatidylcholine also activated.
