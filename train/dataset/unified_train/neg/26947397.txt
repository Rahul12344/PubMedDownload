virus-like particles (vlps) promising molecular structures design and
construction novel vaccines, diagnostic tools, gene therapy vectors. size,
oligomer assembly repetitiveness epitopes optimal features induce
strong immune responses. several vlp-based vaccines currently licensed and
commercialized, many vaccine candidates preclinical and
clinical studies. recent years, development genetically engineered
recombinant vlps accelerated need new, improved downstream processes.
in particular, rapid low cost purification process identified a
remaining key challenge manufacturing process development. present
study set size-exclusion chromatography-based, scalable purification
protocol purification vlp-based influenza vaccine produced in
escherichia coli. recombinant vlps derived rna bacteriophage ms2
displaying epitope ectodomain matrix 2 protein influenza a
virus produced purified. 3 steps purification protocol uses a
recently developed multimodal size-exclusion chromatography medium (capto™ core
700) combination detergent extraction size-exclusion polishing to
reach 89% vlp purity 19% yield. combination downstream
strategy following production e. coli would suited production of
vlp-based veterinary vaccines targeting livestock companion animals where
large amounts doses must produced affordable price.
