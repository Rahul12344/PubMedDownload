purpose: ad5.sstr/tk.rgd infectivity-enhanced adenovirus expressing a
therapeutic thymidine kinase suicide gene somatostatin receptor (sstr) that
allows noninvasive gene transfer imaging. purpose study to
identify maximum tolerated dose (mtd), toxicities, clinical efficacy, and
biologic effects ad5.sstr/tk.rgd patients recurrent gynecologic
cancer.
experimental design: eligible patients treated intraperitoneally 3 days 
with 1 × 10(9) 1 × 10(12) vp/dose ad5.sstr/tk.rgd followed intravenous
ganciclovir 14 days. toxicity clinical efficacy assessed using
common toxicity criteria (ctc) adverse events grading response evaluation
criteria solid tumors (recist) criteria. imaging using in-111 pentetreotide
was obtained treatment. tissue samples obtained evaluate
for gene transfer, generation wild-type virus, viral shedding, antibody
response.
results: twelve patients treated three cohorts. common
vector-related clinical toxicities grade i/ii constitutional pain
symptoms, experienced often patients treated highest dose. mtd was
not identified. five patients showed stable disease; others experienced
progressive disease. one patient stable disease experienced complete
resolution disease normalization ca125 follow-up. imaging
detected increased in-111 pentetreotide retention patients treated the
highest dose. ancillary studies showed presence ad5.sstr/tk.rgd virus and
hsv1-tk expression ascites samples collected various time points most
patients treated within higher dose cohorts.
conclusions: study shows safety, potential efficacy, possible gene
transfer imaging capacity ad5.sstr/tk.rgd patients recurrent
gynecologic cancer. development novel gene therapeutic appears to
be warranted.
