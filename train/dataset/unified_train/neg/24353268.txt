chemokine receptor ccr7, receptor ccl19 ccl21 chemokines,
regulates recruitment clustering circulating leukocytes secondary
lymphoid tissues, lymph nodes peyer's patches. even though teleost
fish either secondary lymphoid structures, recently 
reported homolog ccr7 rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss). present
work, studied distribution leukocytes bearing extracellular ccr7
in naive adult tissues flow cytometry, observing among different
leukocyte populations, highest numbers cells membrane (mem)ccr7 
recorded gill (7.5 ± 2% ccr7(+) cells). comparison, head kidney,
spleen, thymus, intestine, peripheral blood possessed <5% ccr7(+) cells. when
ccr7 studied early developmental stages, detected progressive
increase gene expression protein ccr7 levels gills throughout
development. surprisingly, majority ccr7(+) cells gills were
not myeloid cells express membrane cd8, igm, igt, expressed
igd cell surface. fact, igd(+) cells gills expressed ccr7. 
intriguingly, igd(+)ccr7(+) population coexpress memigm. finally,
when trout bath challenged viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus, the
number ccr7(+) cells significantly decreased gills significantly 
increased head kidney. results provide evidence presence a
novel memigd(+)memigm(-) b lymphocyte subset trout expresses memccr7 
responds viral infections. similarities igd(+)igm(-) subsets mammals
are discussed.
