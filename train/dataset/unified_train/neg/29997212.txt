we pursuing cancer immunotherapy neuro-attenuated recombinant
poliovirus, pvsripo. pvsripo live attenuated type 1 (sabin) poliovirus
vaccine carrying heterologous internal ribosomal entry site (ires) human
rhinovirus type 2 (hrv2). intratumoral infusion pvsripo showing promise 
the therapy recurrent grade iv malignant glioma (glioblastoma), a
notoriously treatment-refractory cancer dismal prognosis. pvsripo exhibits
profound cytotoxicity infected neoplastic cells expressing poliovirus
receptor cd155. addition, elicits intriguing persistent translation and
replication, giving rise sustained type interferon (ifn)-dominant
proinflammatory stimulation antigen-presenting cells. key determinant the
inflammatory footprint generated neoplastic cell infection role in

innate antiviral responses considered key instigating
tumor-antigen-specific antitumor immunity cancer immunotherapy approaches.
however, double-edged sword attempts enlist viruses such
approaches. addition role transition innate adaptive
immunity, innate antiviral ifn responses may intercept viral life cycle in
cancerous cells, prevent viral cytopathogenicity, restrict viral spread. this
has shown reduce overall antitumor efficacy several proposed oncolytic
virus prototypes, presumably limiting direct cell killing ensuing
