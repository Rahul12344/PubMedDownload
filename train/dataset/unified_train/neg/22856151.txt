the influence antivirals, rimantadine, ribavirine triazavirine 
influenza virus replication human cell cultures evaluated. the
antivirals inhibited viral nucleoprotein np synthesis. strongest effect was
shown ribavirine lung carcinoma a-549 cells endothelial ecv-304 cells.
hoechst-33258 staining revealed induction apoptosis cell lines.
rimantadine ribavirine inhibited virus-induced apoptosis ribavirine
enhanced it. effect registered monolayer cell cultures well in
suspension cell cultures. influence antiviral drugs the
virus-induced cell proliferation suspension cell cultures also
described.
