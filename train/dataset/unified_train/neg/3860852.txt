the presence duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) dna liver serum its
state (integrated vs. free) studied 23 ducks chi-tung county in
china spot hybridization southern blot hybridization, respectively. 16 
of 23 (70%), dhbv dna detected serum and/or liver tissue. these
infected ducks showed variety pathological changes including advanced
chronic disease liver. contrast, none virus-negative ducks had
advanced hepatic changes. one dhbv dna-seropositive duck large
hepatocellular carcinoma. southern blot analysis demonstrated integrated dhbv dna
in neoplastic tissue abundant episomal dhbv dna non-neoplastic tissue of
the liver. one noninfected duck small adenoma, viral dna was
detected tumor non-neoplastic tissue. detection integrated dhbv dna 
in hepatocellular carcinoma suggests dhbv behaves like human woodchuck
hepatitis viruses relation chronic liver disease hepatocarcinogenesis.
