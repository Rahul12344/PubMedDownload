aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio index (apri) originally been
considered noninvasive marker detecting hepatic fibrosis patients
with chronic hepatitis b c. apri used predicting liver-related
mortality patients chronic hepatitis c virus infection alcoholic liver
disease. however, whether apri could useful predicting mortality in
chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection remains unevaluated. study aims to
address knowledge gap. total 193 hospitalized chronic hbv-infected
patients (cirrhosis, n = 100; noncirrhosis, n = 93) 88 healthy subjects 
retrospectively enrolled. patients followed 4 months. mortality
that occurred within 90 days hospital stay compared among patients with
different apri. apri predictive value evaluated univariate and
multivariate regression embedded cox proportional hazards model. apri varied
significantly cohort (range, 0.16-10.00). elevated apri associated
with increased severity liver disease 3-month mortality hospitalized
patients hbv-related cirrhosis. multivariate analysis demonstrated apri
(odds ratio: 1.456, p < 0.001) model end-stage liver disease score
(odds ratio: 1.194, p < 0.001) 2 independent markers predicting
mortality. apri simple marker may serve additional predictor of
3-month mortality hospitalized patients hbv-related decompensated
cirrhosis.
