anticancer drug doxorubicin commonly used cancer treatment. however, drug's
severe side effects make toxicity reduction important matter. another
biologically active aromatic compound, pentoxifylline, sequester aromatic
compounds stacking complexes reducing bioactivity. work deals 
the problem alleviating doxorubicin side effects pentoxifylline. we
employed wide spectrum prokaryotic eukaryotic cellular assays. in
addition, used doxorubicin-pentoxifylline mixed association constant to
quantitatively assess pentoxifylline influence doxorubicin mutagenic
activity. obtained results indicate strong protective effects pentoxifylline
towards doxorubicin, observed bacteria human keratinocytes such
effects observed cancer cells. may hypothesized that, considering
much shorter half-life pentoxifylline doxorubicin, simultaneous
administration doxorubicin pentoxifylline lead gradual release 
doxorubicin complexes pentoxifylline reach desired therapeutic
concentration. proposed results shed light possible doxorubicin
chemotherapy modification side effects reduction without loss 
therapeutic potential.
