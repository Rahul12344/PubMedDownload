most patients succumbing colorectal cancer fail liver-predominant
metastases. make clinical impact disease, systemic whole-liver 
therapy may required, whereas cancer gene therapy approaches limited 
in ability treat beyond local disease. preclinical model cancer
gene therapy, recombinant adenovirus containing human ifn-beta (hifn-beta)
cdna delivered systemically nude mouse xenograft models human
colorectal cancer liver metastases. vector targeted hepatocytes produced
high levels hifn-beta liver, resulting profound apoptotic response
in tumors significant tumor regression. hifn-beta gene therapy only
resulted improved survival long-term cure micrometastatic model, 
provided similar benefits clinically relevant gross disease model. similar
recombinant adenovirus containing murine ifn-beta (mifn-beta) cdna also
resulted therapeutic response improved survival syngeneic mouse
models colorectal cancer liver metastases. depletion studies demonstrate a
contribution natural killer cells therapeutic response. toxicity
of adenoviral vector expressing murine ifn-beta syngeneic model also
presented. encouraging results warrant investigation use 
cancer gene therapy targeting metastatic disease.
