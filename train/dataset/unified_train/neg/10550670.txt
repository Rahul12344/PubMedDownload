the nucleotide sequences 3' leader 5' trailer regions determined 
for genomic rna bovine respiratory syncytial virus (brsv) strain a-51908. 
leader trailer sequences '45' '161' nucleotides length,
respectively. functionality brsv leader trailer sequences their
recognition hrsv ovine respiratory syncytial virus (orsv) proteins were
examined vitro transcribed brsv genomic rna analog carrying the
bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (cat) gene control brsv
transcription signals. upon transfection brsv, hrsv orsv infected cells, 
the brsv minireplicons 'rescued' reporter gene expressed, 
the minigenome replicated packaged micrococcal nuclease
resistant-infectious minireplicons. passage infectious minireplicons could
be blocked polyclonal brsv neutralizing antiserum. bovine parainfluenza
virus-3, heterologous paramyxovirus inactive rescuing brsv genomic rna
analog. mutational substitution g residue position 4 leader sequence
in brsv genomic rna analog, u residue inhibited its
transcription replication, replacement c residue no
significant effect rescue. results show cis-acting elements 
brsv functional also recognized proteins hrsv orsv. the
helper virus complemented rescue system developed useful for
characterizing cis-acting elements brsv.
