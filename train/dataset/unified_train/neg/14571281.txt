the present study provides direct experimental proof combination of
influenza virus infection a/aichi/2/68 (h3n3) different models oxidative 
stress, immobilization, cold cold-restraint, associated with
graduated oxidative disturbances stomach mice, despite absence of
virus replication inflammation tissue. found experimental
influenza virus infection accompanied significant changes gastric
mucosal integrity, well increase products lipid peroxidation
in stomachs mice. preliminary exposure mice immobilization stress
and subsequent inoculation influenza virus significantly influence
gastric ulceration lipid peroxidation compared infected mice. cold stress
resulted significant decrease index stomach ulceration not
influence fluorescent products lipid peroxidation mda compared with
infected animals. simultaneous application cold-restraint stress and
influenza virus infection provoked synergism activity factors on
the parameters investigation. ulceration increased approximately two-fold, 
as amount fluorescent products lipid peroxidation mda, compared
with influenza virus-infected non-stressed animals.
