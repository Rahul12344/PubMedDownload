background & objectives: human parvovirus b 19 (pvb 19) causes aplastic crisis in
children congenital haemolytic anaemia, erythema infectiosum, abortion and
stillbirth. since data pvb 19 prevalence lacking india, pilot study
was undertaken estimate prevalence igg antibody children adults.
methods: samples obtained children attending hospital 
volunteer blood donors, majority south india. included 45 
children aged 1-5 yr, 39 aged 6-10 yr, 42 aged 11-15 yr 100 healthy blood
donors > 15 yr age. sera tested presence antibody pvb 19
using commercial enzyme immuno assay (eia).
results: 226 samples tested, 113 (50%) positive pvb 19 igg. the
prevalence antibody increased 8.9 per cent 1-5 yr 70 per cent in
those > 15 yr: median age infection 6 15 yr. sex and
domiciliary status significant effect prevalence antibody.
the igg antibody index increased significantly age, suggesting repeated
exposure virus.
interpretation & conclusion: seroprevalence study indicates large
numbers individuals show exposure pvb 19 virus. exposure indicated
by igg positivity seen increase age. igg negative individuals may 
be considered risk developing infections due pvb 19.
