seven methods transfection bacteria compared optimized for
use spiroplasma citri strain hp using spiroplasma virus spv1 r8a2 b
replicative form (rf). methods included chemical-mediated protocols
[cacl2, rbcl/cacl2, polyethylene glycol (peg)], liposome-mediated transfection,
electroporation, freeze/thaw cycling, natural competence. best protocols 
were utilized peg electroporation, yielding transfection
frequencies 1.4 x 10(-4) 9.1 x 10(-4) transfectants/colony-forming unit
(cfu), respectively. protocols, transfection frequencies were
higher using cscl-purified, covalently closed, circular dna. peg-mediated 
protocol, sigma 8000 brand peg final concentration 44%, presence 
of carrier dna proved optimal peg exposure time 2 min. using
electroporation, 1-2 ms pulse 6.5 kv/cm electric field best; washing
the host cell pellet prior electroporation enhanced efficiencies 50%.
linearization dna resulted lower transfection efficiencies either
method.
