like herpesviruses, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv, also
designated human herpesvirus 8) establish latent infection infected 
host. latency small number genes expressed. one genes
encodes latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana), constitutively
expressed cells latent well lytic infection. lana previously 
been shown important establishment latent episome maintenance
through tethering viral genome host chromosomes. specific
conditions, kshv undergo lytic replication, production viral
progeny. immediate-early rta, encoded open reading frame 50 kshv, has
been shown play critical role switching viral latent replication 
lytic replication. overexpression rta heterologous promoter is
sufficient driving kshv lytic replication production viral
progeny. present study, show lana down-modulates rta's promoter
activity transient reporter assays, thus repressing rta-mediated
transactivation. results decrease production kshv progeny
virions. also found lana interacts physically rta vivo and
in vitro. taken together, results demonstrate lana inhibit viral
lytic replication inhibiting expression well antagonizing function
of rta. suggests lana may play critical role maintaining latency
by controlling switch viral latency lytic replication.
