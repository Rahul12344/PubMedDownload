four new antimycin alkaloids (1-4) six related known analogs (5-10) were
isolated culture marine derived streptomyces sp. ths-55, 
structures elucidated extensive spectroscopic analysis. the
compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity vitro hpv-transformed hela
cell line. among them, compounds 6-7 derived natural products the
first time, compound 5 (nada) showed highest potency. nada inhibited 
proliferation, arrested cell cycle distribution, triggered apoptosis hela 
cancer cells. molecular mechanic studies revealed nada degraded levels of
e6/e7 oncoproteins ros-mediated ubiquitin-dependent proteasome system
activation. first report demonstrates antimycin alkaloids
analogue induces degradation high-risk hpv e6/e7 oncoproteins finally 
induces apoptosis cervical cancer cells. present work suggested these
analogues could serve lead compounds development hpv-infected
cervical cancer therapeutic agents, well research tools study of
e6/e7 functions.
