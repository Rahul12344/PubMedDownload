envelope glycoprotein e flaviviruses exposed surface virion, 
and responsible eliciting neutralizing antibody (ab) response, well
as protective immunity host. report, describe method 
fine mapping linear sequence e protein dengue virus type-2
(den-2), recognized type-specific neutralizing monoclonal ab (mab), 3h5.
first, escherichia coli expression vector containing heat-inducible lambda
pl promoter used synthesize several truncated, near-full length e
polypeptides. reactivities polypeptides polyclonal mouse
hyperimmune sera, well 3h5 mab revealed location 3h5-binding
site within region 166 amino acids (aa) aa 255 422. for
fine mapping, series targeted deletions made inframe within region
using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). hydrophilicity pattern this
region used guide systematically delete regions encoding the
various groups surface aa residues within context near-full-length e 
polypeptide using pcr. 3h5-binding site thus precisely mapped a
region encoding 12 aa (between aa 386 397). synthetic peptide containing
this sequence able bind 3h5 mab specifically, shown by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. addition, show rabbit abs raised
against synthetic peptide 12 aa able bind authentic e
protein, neutralize den-2 virus plaque reduction assay.
