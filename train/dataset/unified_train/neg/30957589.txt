introduction: influenza occurs worldwide causes significant disease burden in
terms morbidity, associated complications, hospitalizations, deaths.
vaccination constitutes primary approach controlling influenza. current
influenza vaccines elicit strain-specific response yet occasionally exhibit
suboptimal effectiveness. review describes limits available
immunization tools future prospects potentiality universal
influenza vaccines.
areas covered: new 'universal' vaccines, presently development,
are expected overcome problems related high variability of
influenza viruses, need seasonal vaccine updates and
re-vaccination. here, explore vaccines based highly conserved epitopes 
of ha, na, extracellular domain influenza m2 protein, along with
those based internal proteins np m1.
expert opinion: development universal influenza vaccine confers
protection homologous, drifted, shifted influenza virus strains could
obviate need annual reformulation mitigate disease burden. the
scientific community long awaiting advent universal influenza
vaccines; currently development laboratories worldwide. if
such vaccines immunogenic, efficacious, able confer long-lasting
immunity, might integrated supplant traditional influenza
vaccines.
