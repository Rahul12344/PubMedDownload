bornaviruses animal rna viruses establish persistent
infection host cell nucleus. studies bornaviruses provided
unique information viral replication strategies virus-host
interactions. although bornaviruses integrate host genome 
their replication cycle, others recently reported dna 
sequences derived mrnas ancient bornaviruses genomes of
vertebrates, including humans, designated endogenous
borna-like (ebl) elements. therefore, bornaviruses interacting with
their hosts driving forces evolution host genomes previously
unexpected way. studies ebl elements provided new models virology,
evolutionary biology general cell biology. review, summarize the
data ebl elements including newly identified eukaryotes
genomes, discuss biological significance ebl elements, focus on
ebl nucleoprotein elements mammalian genomes. surprisingly, ebl elements 
detected genomes invertebrates, suggesting host range of
bornaviruses may much wider previously thought. also review new
data non-retroviral integration borna disease virus.
