first-generation adenovirus vectors (adv) used successfully transfer
a human dystrophin minigene skeletal muscle mdx mice. studies,
strong viral promoters cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer (cmv) were
used drive dystrophin expression. recently, short version muscle
creatine kinase promoter (mck1350) shown provide muscle-specific
reporter gene expression adv-mediated gene delivery. therefore, we
generated recombinant adv dystrophin expression controlled mck1350 
(advmckdys). advmckdys injected intramuscular route anterior
tibialis muscle mdx mice shortly birth. dystrophin expression was
assessed 20, 30, 60 days adv-injection. 20 days, muscles of
advmckdys-injected mdx mice showed high number dystrophin-positive fibers
(mean: 365). 60 days, number dystrophin-positive fibers only
maintained, increased significantly (mean: 600). conclusion, mck1350
allows sustained dystrophin expression adv-mediated gene transfer to
skeletal muscle newborn mdx mice. contrast previous studies, where
strong viral promoters used, dystrophin expression driven mck1350 peaks
at later time points. may implications future use of
muscle-specific promoters gene therapy duchenne muscular dystrophy.
