objective: clarify distribution hepatitis virus (hav) genotype in
geographical regions china.
methods: seventeen representative hav strains isolated stool or
serum hepatitis patients different geographical regions. viral rna was
recovered stool serum proteinase k digestion phenol-chloroform
extraction, followed ethanol precipitation prior reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) amplification. nucleotide sequences of
vp1/2a junction region tested using direct sequencing technique.
results: pairwise comparison sequences within 168 bases vp1/2a
junction revealed sequences clustered within genotype i. 53%
of strains clustered genotype b, less 6% variability; the
others clustered genotype a, less 5.3% variability. sequence
homology genotype b varied 88.7% 92.3%.
conclusion: epidemic sporadic hav strains china may belong hav genotype 
i b. epidemiologically related strains may identical closely related
in sequence.
