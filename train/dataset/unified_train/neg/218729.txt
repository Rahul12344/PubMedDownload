a colony mice suffering dominant hemimelia associated agenesis of
the spleen developed characterized past 7 years. the
hereditarily asplenic (dh/+) mice low incidence (9%) spontaneous
mammary tumors (smt). asplenic (dh/+) females mated mice homozygous
(nu/nu) hereditary athymia (nude) balb/c background. balb/c females 
heterozygous nu gene spleen (nu/+,+/+) moderate incidence
(12%) smt, whereas nu/+,dh/+ breeders drastic increase incidence
of smt 46% bred identical conditions. since parent strains have
a low incidence smt, appears spleen agenesis major
factor accounting earlier higher incidence smt hereditarily
asplenic (nu/+,dh/+) mice normal (nu/+,+/+) siblings. smt express
mammary tumor virus antigen(s) possess estrogen, progesterone, and
glucocorticoid receptors. smt rapidly metastasize kill host within 30
to 45 days. balb/c asplenic mice smt represent unique model relevant
to human breast cancer study function spleen the
development solid tumors general smt particular.
