a number recent reports established oligoclonality and/or clonal
expansion common feature cd8+ cell population. oligoclonal
expansion also observed bone marrow transplant recipients and
rheumatoid arthritis patients, disease states cd57+cd8+ cells are
occasionally elevated. study compared tcr repertoire the
cd57+ cd57- subsets cd8+ cells normal persons using three-color
facs analysis panel 16 mabs specific tcr v segments. cd57
surface marker highly variable frequency generally present a
minority cd8+cd3+ cells (mean 16.3%, sd 12.7) group 41 normal
volunteers. dramatic oligoclonal expansion present cd57+cd8+ cell
population 15 41 (37%) study population thus characteristic
feature normal immune system. prominent oligoclonal expansions
were observed cd57-cd8+ subset, although preliminary experiments suggest
that oligoclonality per se occasionally present lower frequency cd57- 
cells. reasons persistent accumulation oligoclonal cd8+cd57+ t
cells function immune homeostasis unclear.
