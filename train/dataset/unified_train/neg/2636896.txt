rabies virus glycoprotein snake venom curaremimetic neurotoxins share a
region high homology (30-45 neurotoxins 190-203 glycoprotein) 
in regions believed responsible binding nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor. monoclonal antibodies raised 190-203 synthetic
fragment rabies virus glycoprotein immobilized high performance
affinity chromatography column able bind neurotoxins. toxins were
displaced affinity column elution acidic ph affinity
competition acetylcholine neutral ph. furthermore, affinity column
proved useful purification cholinergic ligands. overall, these
results indicate paratope monoclonal antibodies could behave as
an 'internal image' nicotinic cholinergic receptor acetylcholine binding
site.
