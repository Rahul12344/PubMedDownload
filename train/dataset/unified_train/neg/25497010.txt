interferon regulatory factor (irf1) potent antiviral, antitumor immune
regulatory protein. recently, found activated ras/mek inhibits antiviral 
response downregulating irf1 expression renders cancer cells susceptible
to oncolytic viruses. study, sought determine whether irf1
downregulation underlies oncogenesis induced ras/mek activation human
cancer cells. treatment mek inhibitor u0126 promoted irf1 expression 7 
of 11 cancer cell lines tested. irf1 promotion also observed human
cancer cell lines treated different mek inhibitors rnai
oligonucleotides extracellular signal-regulated kinases (erks).
restoration expression antitumor genes, p27 p53 upregulated
modulator apoptosis (puma), mek inhibition less irf1 shrna knockdown
cancer cells vector control cancer cells, suggesting ras/mek targets
irf1 downregulation antitumor genes. moreover, apoptosis induction
by u0126 significantly reduced irf1 shrna knockdown cells vector
control cells. study demonstrates irf1 expression suppressed by
activated ras/mek human cancer cells irf1 plays essential roles in
apoptosis induced ras/mek inhibition.
