bacterially expressed nucleocapsid (n) protein, respiratory syncytial virus 
(rsv), used investigate rna binding modified north-western blotting
protocol. recombinant protein demonstrated sequence specificity binding
rna representing either antigenomic leader sequence nonspecific
sequence derived plasmid vector. recombinant n purified cscl
gradients, two types structure, densities indicating they
contained rna, could visualised negative-stain electron microscopy.
structures similar nucleocapsids (nc) rsv-infected cells observed,
as ring structures. small fragment n (amino acids 1-92) all
that required production nc-like structures. another mutant with
an internal deletion could form rings nc-like structures. suggests
that domain (amino acids 121-160) may important maintaining helical
stability. analysis also identified potential site the
amino-terminus may involved interaction phosphoprotein. 
domain model rsv n protein presented which, similar other
paramyxoviruses, supports idea amino-terminus important nc
assembly.
