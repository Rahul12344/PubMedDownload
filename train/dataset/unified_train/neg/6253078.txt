molecular engineering herpes simplex virus genome: insertion second
l-s junction genome causes additional genome inversions.

mocarski es, post le, roizman b.

we developed technique insertion dna fragment the
herpes simplex virus (hsv) genome specific sites. technique used to
resolve specific problem concerning isomerization hsv genome.
briefly, hsv dna consists four isomers differing orientation two
covalently linked components, l s, relative other. component
consists unique sequences flanked inverted repeats. determine whether
the isomerization hsv dna result generalized recombinatin between
homologous reiterated sequences inverted repeats result of
site-specific recombination, constructed plasmids dna fragments
derived various regions viral genome inserted both
orientations thymidine kinase gene, rendering nonfunctional. hsv 
dna sequences plasmids recombined viral genome, and
viral recombinants selected thymidine kinase-deficient phenotype. 
the insertion fragments homologous recombination highly efficient
in viral clones isolated contained inserted fragment the
expected location. fragments promoted additional inversions 
viral genome spanning junction l components.
furthermore, analysis isomers formed recombinants indicates 
inversions occur sequences inserted fragment inverted
orientation relation homologous sequences termini the
authentic junction.
