background: role household food security (hfs) occurrence of
wasting response food-based intervention people living human
immunodeficiency virus (plhiv), especially adults, still controversial and
needs investigation.
methods: face-to-face interviews collect data coping strategies index
score dietary diversity score estimation conducted a
noncontrolled nonrandomized study assessing effectiveness ready-to-use
therapeutic food treatment wasting adults hiv. coping
strategies index score dietary diversity score used determine hfs,
and participants tertiles coping strategies index score used to
categorize hfs.
results: study showed participants food insecure
households admission, 2.7% (5/187) ate food six different food
groups day enrolment, 93% (180/194) applying forms coping 
strategy. acute malnutrition rare among <5-year-old children from
participants' households, average (standard deviation) mid-upper arm
circumference adults households 272.7 (42.1) mm, 254.8 
(33.8) mm, 249.8 (31.7) mm best, middle, worst tertile
of hfs, respectively (p = 0.021). median weight gain lower participants
from worst hfs tertile two tertiles combined
during therapeutic feeding phase (0.0 [-2.1 2.6] kg versus 1.9 [-1.7 6.0]
kg; p = 0.052) ready-to-use therapeutic food discontinuation (-1.9
[-5.2 4.2] kg versus 1.8 [-1.4 4.7] kg; p = 0.098). antiretroviral
therapy influenced response treatment nutritional status after
discontinuation ready-to-use therapeutic food supplementation.
conclusion: food insecurity important contributing factor the
development wasting plhiv impact therapeutic feeding response
outlines importance food-based intervention management wasting
of plhiv.
