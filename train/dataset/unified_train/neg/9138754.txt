apart unique changes characteristic "hiv encephalitis", the
productive infection central nervous system hiv, involves
predominantly white matter basal ganglia, evidence accumulating that
the cerebral cortex may also affected aids patients. neuronal loss,
suspected microscopical examination, demonstrated number of
morphometric studies. however, cause mechanism neuronal damage hiv 
infection, still unclear. attempt look apoptotic process at
the origin neuronal loss aids, examined samples frontal cortex,
temporal cortex basal ganglia 12 patients died aids 4
hiv-positive asymptomatic cases using situ end labelling demonstrate
characteristic dna fragmentation. compared 5 seronegative
asymptomatic controls, 2 seronegative patients alzheimer's disease. we
demonstrated neuronal apoptosis aids cases alzheimer's
cases. positive situ end labelling usually associated morphological
changes suggestive neuronal apoptosis. semiquantitative appreciation the
density apoptotic neurons showed neuronal apoptosis severe in
atrophic brains. contrast, correlation found density of
apoptotic neurons presence hiv encephalitis history cognitive 
disorder. occasional apoptotic neurons found one asymptomatic,
hiv-positive case. apoptosis never observed asymptomatic seronegative
cases. experimental studies tend support vivo findings. infection by
hiv primary cultures human embryonic central nervous system induced
frequent apoptosis neurons. apoptotic cell identified non infected
control cultures.
