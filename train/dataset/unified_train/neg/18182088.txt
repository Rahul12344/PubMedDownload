the 11th influenza virus protein pb1-f2 previously shown enhance
apoptosis response cytotoxic stimuli. 87 amino acid protein is
encoded alternative reading frame pb1 polymerase gene described 
to localize mitochondria consistent proapoptotic function. however,
pb1-f2 also found diffusely distributed cytoplasm nucleus
suggesting additional functions protein. show pb1-f2
colocalizes directly interacts viral pb1 polymerase protein. lack of
pb1-f2 infection resulted altered localization pb1 decreased 
viral polymerase activity. consequently, mutant viruses devoid functional
pb1-f2 reading frame exhibited small plaque phenotype. thus, identified
a novel function pb1-f2 indirect regulator influenza virus
polymerase activity via interaction pb1.
