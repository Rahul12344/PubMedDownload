earlier results suggested functional hemizygosity genes in
pseudodiploid chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells due silencing one
allele dna methylation. one could make strong prediction we
have able confirm genetic experiments, using thymidine kinase (tk)
alleles. tk- mutants induced ethylmethane sulphonate (ems) revertible
to tk+ high frequency demethylating agent 5-azacytidine (5-aza-cr).
this revertibility due reactivation silent nonmutant tk allele.
further mutagenesis ems yielded tk- derivatives longer revertible
by 5-aza-cr; assumed mutations alleles. tk- cells 
also transfected equine herpes virus tk+ dna, tk+ derivatives were
shown markedly less stable cells normal tk+ gene. cho cells
lack metallothionein activity (sensitive cadmium), also require proline
for growth, genes become silenced establishment the
cell line. cases 5-aza-cr reactivates genes give cadmium
resistant proline independent phenotypes. long-term experiments with
reactivants absence selection showed genes become silent,
presumably result de novo methylation. strain resistant cytosine
arabinoside (aracr) also resistant 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-aza-cdr), not
to 5-aza-cr, would expected aracr strain lacked deoxycytidine
kinase.(abstract truncated 250 words)
