the varicella-zoster virus (vzv) etiological agent two different human 
pathologies, chickenpox (varicella) shingles (zoster). alphaherpesvirus 
is believed acquire lipidic envelope trans-golgi network (tgn).
this consistent previous data showing abundant vzv envelope
glycoprotein ge accumulates steady-state organelle expressed from
cloned cdna. present study, investigated intracellular
trafficking gi, another vzv envelope glycoprotein. transfected cells, 
protein shows slow biosynthetic transport cell surface it
accumulates. however, upon co-expression ge, gi experiences dramatic
increase exit rate endoplasmic reticulum, accumulates a
sialyltransferase-positive compartment, presumably tgn, cycles between
this compartment cell surface. differential behavior results from
the ability ge gi form complex early stages the
biosynthetic pathway whose intracellular traffic exclusively determined the
sorting information tail ge. thus, gi provides first example a
molecule localized tgn means association another tgn
protein. also show that, early stages vzv infection, both
proteins also found tgn host cell. suggests existence 
of intermediate stage vzv biogenesis envelope
glycoproteins, transiently arrested tgn, could promote envelopment 
newly synthesized nucleocapsids compartment and, therefore, the
assembly infective viruses.
