human papillomaviruses recognized causative agent anogenital 
cancer. 2006, commercial vaccine based virus-like particles composed of
the l1 major capsid protein papillomaviruses available. this
vaccine induces virus-neutralizing antibody responses upon parenteral injection. 
here investigated oral immunogenicity different assembly forms hpv
16 l1, is: t7-vlps, t1 particles capsomeres. results show all
three assembly forms induce humoral cellular immune responses oral
vaccination mice. anti-l1 antibodies conformation-specific showed
neutralizing activity pseudovirion-based assay. also investigated if
adjuvants influence oral immunogenicity different l1 forms.
for saponins observed significant toxicity applied orally.
co-administration either cpg dna escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin
lt(r192g) apparent enhancing effect production anti-l1
antibodies. pronounced effect cpg administration long-term
immunity observed significantly stronger recall response 244 days after
the first vaccination. compared capsomeres, vlps induced stronger humoral
immune responses ctl responses induced comparable levels.
finally, also able induce neutralizing antibodies l1-specific
cytotoxic t-lymphocytes oral administration crude extracts of
l1-expressing insect cells. conclusion, three assembly forms l1
protein immunogenic administered orally.
