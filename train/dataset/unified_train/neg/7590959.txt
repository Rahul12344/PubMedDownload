penicillin resistance plasmid transferred staphylococcus aureus b4
(pcrkms, donor) s. aureus ml351 (pcskmr, recipient) co-cultivation the
donor recipient nutrient broth without modifying effects 
of cacl2 sodium dodecyl sulfate. found transfer of
drug-resistance occurred maximally 6 18 hr postinoculation; however, 
addition dnase (200 micrograms/ml) could totally prevent transfer to
6 hr significantly reduce thereafter. cell-free filtrate donor
culture mixed recipient ineffective bringing the
