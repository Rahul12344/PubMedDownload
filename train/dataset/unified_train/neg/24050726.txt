backgound/aim: studies associating chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection with
lipid profile hepatic steatosis children adolescents scarce. 
study investigated lipid profile abnormalities hepatic steatosis among
hcv-infected egyptian children adolescents survived leukemia lymphoma
and evaluated impact response antiviral therapy.
subjects methods: thirty-six leukemia/lymphoma cured children adolescents
(mean age: 12.47 ± 3.56 years) chronic hcv infection 30 healthy controls
(mean age: 11.64 ± 3.96 years) enrolled prospective study. serum
lipid profile abdominal ultrasonography done patients and
controls. guided liver biopsy histopathological examination done 32 
(88.9%) patients eligible antiviral therapy.
results: total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, apolipoprotein b (apo-b) in
patients significantly lower control group (p ≤ .01, ≤ .01, 
≤ .05, respectively). among underwent liver biopsy (n = 32),
macrovesicular hepatic steatosis associated chronic hepatitis c was
documented 10 children (31.3%). body mass index significantly higher (p ≤ 
.05) apo-b significantly lower steatotic (p ≤ .05) non-steatotic 
hcv-infected children. liver span ultrasound, alanine aminotransferase (alt), 
and apo-b independent predictors hepatic steatosis (p < .001, <.001, and
<.05, respectively). significantly worse response interferon alpha 2-b plus 
ribavrin treatment hcv reported among children steatosis (p < .001).
conclusions: study showed low serum lipids hcv-infected children with
cured leukemia/lymphoma. hepatic steatosis found significant proportion 
of patients associated poor response antiviral treatment.
