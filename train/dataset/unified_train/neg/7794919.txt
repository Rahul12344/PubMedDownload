whereas baculovirus expression systems extensively used high-level 
expression steroid receptors receptors coupled adenylate cyclase, there
are studies peptide receptors coupled phospholipase c (plc). the
present study expressed murine gastrin-releasing peptide receptor
(mgrp-r) sf9 cells using recombinant baculovirus characterized it
structurally functionally. mgrp-r detectible 12 h post infection with
recombinant baculovirus carrying mgrp-r cdna became maximal 60 h post
infection (bmax = 6 pmol/mg protein), 4-60-fold greater density than
is found native tissues. mgrp-r sf9 cells assessed affinity labeling
or immunoblotting smaller native tissues (m(r) = 51 kd vs 82
kd), difference due extent glycosylation. sf9 cells 
mgrp-r least two four potential extracellular glycosylation sites
glycosylated, whereas native receptor four approximately equally 
glycosylated. sf9 cells glycosylation entirely biantennary complex, in
contrast native mgrp-r, entirely tri- tetraantennary
complex n-linked oligosaccharides. affinity labeling studies revealed band with
an apparent molecular mass 40 kda higher 51-kda mgrp-r band. the
intensity band correlated extent functional g protein
coupling, suggesting may represent mgrp-r-g protein complex. in
binding studies affinity mgrp-r sf9 cells agonists bombesin
(bn), grp, neuromedin b (nmb) varied differently infection time: bn
the affinity decreased 3-fold longer infection times, grp remained
unchanged, nmb decreased 10-fold. gpp(nh)p inhibited binding of
either [125i]tyr4bn [125i]grp 24 h post infection, 96 h post
infection. agonists activated plc, increasing [3h]ip [ca2+]i; however,
the efficacy agonist decreased infection time. results
demonstrate use recombinant baculovirus infected sf9 cells the
plc-linked receptor mgrp-r expressed amounts significantly greater than
those native tissues. mgrp-r expressed sf9 cells incompletely 
glycosylated less complex n-linked oligosaccharide chains, yet is
fully coupled g proteins activates phospholipase c, similar native 
receptor, short infection times used.(abstract truncated 400 words)
