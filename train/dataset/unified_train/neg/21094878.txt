since introduction combined antiretroviral therapy (cart), solid organ
transplantation (sot) become therapeutic option hiv-positive
population. contrast liver kidney transplantation, three
simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (spkt) reported among
hiv-infected patients. herein reported first spkt hiv-infected 
patient spain. pancreas graft failed 2 weeks patient died 9 
months pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. three recipients
reported literature lived, despite failure pancreas and
kidney grafts one subject. despite poor outcome case, hiv-1
infection controlled transplantation (stable cd4(+) cells no
aids-related events), kidney graft functioned episodes of
rejection. cart regimen used pretransplant period switched 
time transplantation raltegravir two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (nrti). raltegravir interactions immunosuppressive drugs. 
target plasma levels tacrolimus achieved dose similar used
in hiv-negative transplant recipients. adequate antiretroviral regimen
for hiv-infected sot recipients yet established; however, one may
consider switching protease inhibitors non-nrti-based regimens a
raltegravir-based regimen time transplantation.
