hepatitis c virus (hcv) infects estimated 170 million individuals worldwide,
and current standard care, combination pegylated interferon alpha and
ribavirin, efficacious achieving sustained viral response ~50% of
treated patients. novel therapies investigation include use of
nucleoside analog inhibitors viral rna-dependent rna polymerase. nm283, 
3'-valyl ester prodrug 2'-c-methylcytidine, demonstrated antiviral
efficacy hcv-infected patients (n. afdhal et al., j. hepatol. 46[suppl. 1]:s5,
2007; n. afdhal et al., j. hepatol. 44[suppl. 2]:s19, 2006). one approach to
increase antiviral efficacy 2'-c-methylcytidine increase the
concentration active inhibitory species, 5'-triphosphate, infected 
hepatocytes. hepdirect prodrug technology increase intracellular
concentrations nucleoside triphosphate hepatocytes introducing the
nucleoside monophosphate cell, bypassing initial kinase step is
often rate limiting. screening 2'-c-methylcytidine triphosphate levels rat
liver oral dosing identified 1-[3,5-difluorophenyl]-1,3-propandiol an
efficient prodrug modification. determine antiviral efficacy vivo, the
prodrug administered separately via oral intravenous dosing two
hcv-infected chimpanzees. circulating viral loads declined ~1.4 log(10) iu/ml 
and >3.6 log(10) iu/ml oral intravenous dosing, respectively. the
viral loads rebounded end dosing predose levels. results
indicate robust antiviral response achieved upon administration 
the prodrug.
