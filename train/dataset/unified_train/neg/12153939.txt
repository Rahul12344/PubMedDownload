human oral squamous cell carcinoma (scc) cell lines hsc4 sas infected
with wild type p53 (wt-p53)-encoding adenovirus (axcaip53) subsequently
irradiated investigate effectiveness p53 gene therapy combination
with radiation therapy treating oral scc. western blot analysis using
anti-p53 monoclonal antibody showed large amount mutant p53 protein was
accumulated hsc4 cells, detectable p53 protein observed sas
cells. induction p53 expression axcaip53 infection clearly observed
in hsc4 sas cells. clonogenic cell survival assay demonstrated that
axcaip53 infection alone, x-irradiation alone, significantly inhibited the
growth cancer cells, combined treatment effective, even in
mutant p53-accumulated hsc4 cells. flow cytometric analysis showed the
apoptotic pathway induced virus treated radiation treated cells. taken
together, findings suggest combination p53 gene therapy and
radiation therapy possibility effectively treat oral scc defective in
p53 function.
