in vitro immunohistochemical investigations human hepatoma cell line
(huh7) infected hepatitis c virus (hcv) strain jfh-1 showed av0012
compound blocks early stages viral infection. av0012 also blocked viral
infection spread tissue culture secreted virus tight
cell-to-cell contact. av0012 specific inhibitor hcv related
pestivirus, flaviviruses rna-containing viruses bovine diarrhea
(bvdv), venezuelan equine encephalitis (strain tc-83), dengue type 2 (new
guinea), yellow fever (strain 17d), west nile fever, parainfluenza (type 3)
virus, rsv (strain a2), rhinovirus (type 2 strain hgp). established
that human serum significantly affect antiviral activity av0012
in vitro. drug combination studies av0012 interferon alpha 2a in
vitro showed two inhibitors act additively, makes possible use
of combination clinical tests. av0012 highly soluble stable in
aqueous solutions murine blood plasma, limited metabolic stability, low
binding human plasma proteins, high permeability biological membranes,
and interacts isoenzymes 2d6 3a4 human cytochrome p450. in
animal pharmacokinetic studies, av0012 rapidly absorbed blood stream
upon oral administration, showed sufficiently long half-elimination times, and
had high oral bioavailability reached 92% monkeys. preclinical
development av0012 progress.
