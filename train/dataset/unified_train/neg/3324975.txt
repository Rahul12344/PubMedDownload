kaposi's sarcoma (ks) human immunodeficiency virus infection (hiv) become 
a rather frequent manifestation previously rare disease fatal
outcome. initial lesions ks studied means histopathology,
immunohistology, electron microscopy order define earliest
alterations. histopathological changes initial lesions distinct,
consisting (1) discrete proliferation capillary vessels, (2) dissection 
collagen proliferating spindle cells formed slits, (3) atypical spindle 
cells arranged indian file pattern, (4) lack inflammatory
cellular infiltrate. double staining antibodies vimentin and
immunohistochemical markers endothelial cells revealed slits forming
vimentin-positive spindle cells displayed laminin, factor viii, pal-e.
atypical vimentin-positive spindle cells arranged indian file pattern
inconsistently expressed laminin factor viii, pal-e. ks cells rarely 
stained lectin uea i, even case less advanced
dedifferentiation. electron microscopy showed gradual transformation between
spindle cells forming slits lost ability form incomplete 
vessel walls. present findings support view ks develops the
endothelial cells blood vessels. proliferation atypical endothelial
cells early initial lesions lack inflammation favors the
primary neoplastic genesis ks.
