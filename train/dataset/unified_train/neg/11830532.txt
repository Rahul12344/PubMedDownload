5-fluorouracil (5-fu) potent antimetabolite used chemotherapy of
gastrointestinal (gi), breast, head neck malignancies. although clinical 
trials conducted, poor therapeutic index 5-fu precluded 
clinical use number tumor types. unclear whether lack
of utility due problems drug delivery inherent insensitivity.
adenovirus (ad) vector-mediated cytosine deaminase (cd)/5-fluorocytosine (5-fc)
gene therapy potential overcome pharmacokinetic issues associated with
systemic 5-fu particularly well suited use tumors local
control paramount, recurrent, localized prostate cancer malignant 
gliomas. study, vitro response panel human tumor cell
lines derived gi (colon, pancreas) non-gi (prostate, glioma) tumors
to 5-fu adcmvcd (an ad encoding escherichia coli cd)/5-fc examined.
whereas sensitivity (ic(50)) individual cell lines agents varied,
no significant difference median ic(50) either 5-fu adcmvcd/5-fc was
evident four tumor types tested (p > 0.1). relevant contributions 
ad gene transfer efficiency inherent 5-fu sensitivity determining response
to adcmvcd/5-fc assessed. multiple linear regression analysis revealed 
that whereas factors significantly contribute response, inherent 5-fu
sensitivity substantially important (beta= 0.78 versus 0.48; p < 0.001).
finally, therapeutic efficacy single intratumoral injection adcmvcd
