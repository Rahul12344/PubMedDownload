we examined primary memory isotype-specific antibody responses directed
against pseudorabies virus serum mucosal fluids pigs without
passively acquired maternal antibody, studied relationship between
these responses protection virus challenge. pigs inoculated
intranasally virulent nia-3 strain avirulent bartha strain, or
they inoculated im inactivated vaccine containing phylaxia
strain. ten weeks later, pigs challenge-exposed intranasally strain
nia-3. pigs without passively acquired antibody time they
were inoculated virulent virus appeared complete protective immunity
against challenge exposure, evidenced lack clinical signs of
pseudorabies lack virus excretion. contrast, pigs inoculated with
strain bartha inactivated vaccine developed fever, period of
growth arrest, excreted virus challenge exposure. pigs without
passively acquired antibody, intranasal inoculation strains nia-3 bartha 
was followed primary igm iga responses serum oropharyngeal fluid
as well primary igg1 igg2 responses serum. intramuscular inoculation
with inactivated vaccine induced primary serum igm, igg1, igg2 responses,
but mucosal responses. challenge exposure pigs inoculated
with bartha strain inactivated vaccine followed clear memory
responses serum oropharyngeal fluid. contrast, challenge exposure of
pigs inoculated virulent nia-3 strain followed by
memory responses.(abstract truncated 250 words)
