we measured fidelity bidirectional, semiconservative dna synthesis by
a human dna replication complex vitro. replication performed extracts
of hela cells presence simian virus 40 (sv40) large tumor antigen by
using double-stranded phage m13mp2 dna template containing sv40 origin of
replication either two different target sequences scoring mutations in
the lacz alpha-complementation gene, encodes alpha region (specifying
the amino-terminal portion) beta-galactosidase. replicative synthesis was
substantially accurate synthesis human dna polymerase alpha-dna 
primase complex purified hela cell extracts immunoaffinity
chromatography, suggesting additional factors activities extract
may increase fidelity bidirectional replication. however, using a
sensitive opal codon reversion assay, single-base substitution errors were
readily detected replication products frequencies significantly higher 
than estimated spontaneous mutation rates vivo. data suggest that
additional fidelity factors may present chromosomal replication vivo
and/or fidelity replication alone account low
spontaneous mutation rates eukaryotes.
