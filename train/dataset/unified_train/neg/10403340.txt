in attempt improve current live-attenuated vaccine (tc-83) for
venezuelan equine encephalitis (vee), specific mutations associated with
attenuation vee virus rodent models identified. mutations were
inserted full-length cdna clones trinidad donkey strain vee virus 
by site-directed mutagenesis, isogenic virus strains mutations
were recovered transfection baby hamster kidney cells infectious
rna. evaluated 10 strains ability replicate be
transmitted aedes taeniorhynchus, natural vector epizootic vee virus. two
vaccine candidates, one containing deletion pe2 furin cleavage site, the
other combination three separate point mutations e2 glycoprotein,
replicated mosquitoes transmitted hamsters significantly less
efficiently either parental (wild type) vee virus tc-83 virus.
although attenuated strains transmitted hamsters mosquitoes, after
intrathoracic inoculation, evidence reversion virulent
phenotype. mutations resulted less efficient replication in, or
transmission by, mosquitoes enhance vaccine safety reduce the
possibility environmental spread unintentional hosts.
