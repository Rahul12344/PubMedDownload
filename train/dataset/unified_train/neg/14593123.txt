allosteric binding calcium ion (ca2+) inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (ip3)
receptor (ip3r) controls channel gating within ip3r. here, present biochemical
and electron microscopic evidence ca2+-sensitive structural changes the
three-dimensional structure type 1 ip3r (ip3r1). low concentrations ca2+
and high concentrations sr2+ ba2+ shown effective the
limited proteolysis ip3r1, mg2+ effect proteolysis. the
electron microscopy limited proteolysis consistently demonstrated that
the effective concentration ca2+ conformational changes ip3r1 was
<10(-7) ip3 scarcely affected conformational states. the
structure ip3r1 without ca2+, reconstructed three-dimensional electron
microscopy, "mushroom-like" appearance consisting large square-shaped 
head small channel domain linked four thin bridges. projection image
of "head-to-head" assembly comprising two particles confirmed the
mushroom-like side view. "windmill-like" form ip3r1 ca2+ also
contains four bridges connecting ip3-binding domain toward the
channel domain. data suggest ca2+-specific conformational change
structurally regulates ip3-triggered channel opening within ip3r1.
