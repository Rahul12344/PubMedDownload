simian virus 40 (sv40) recombinants carrying adenovirus type 12 e1a gene were
constructed. sv40 expression vector constructed removing the
vp1 gene internal part intervening sequence late 16s rna by
joining 5' 3' splice sites small segment. adenovirus type 12
e1a gene without promoter inserted downstream sv40
late promoter splicing junctions. recombinant dna propagated 
packaged monkey cells cotransfection early temperature-sensitive
mutant (tsa58) dna helper. immunofluorescent staining monkey cells
infected resulting virus stocks showed 20% cells
overproduced e1a gene products nuclei. two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis products indicated products similar 
identical authentic polypeptides synthesized adenovirus type
12-infected human embryo kidney cells. e1a mrna initiated sv40
late promoter irrespective presence e1a promoter terminated 
either e1a sv40 polyadenylation signal. hybrid mrnas were
correctly spliced e1a coding region.
