avian reovirus polypeptides: analysis intracellular virus-specified products, 
virions, top component, cores.

schnitzer tj, ramos t, gouvea v.

avian reovirus-specified polypeptides separated three size classes:
large (lambda), medium (mu), small (sigma), similar mammalian
reoviruses. nomenclature proposed indicate individual
polypeptides within size class progressive alphabetical subscripts. three
lambda polypeptides (lambda(a), lambda(b), lambda(c)) found infectious
viral particles molecular weights 145,000, 130,000, 115,000,
respectively. present core preparations, two (lambda(a) and
lambda(b)) appear exposed surface virion. two mu polypeptides
can distinguished purified virus (mu(a), 72,000 daltons; mu(b), 70,000
daltons), another occasionally evident immunoprecipitation from
infected-cell extracts (mu(ns)). mu(b) represents major outer capsid protein 
and structurally homologous mu(1c) mammalian reoviruses. no
additional mu proteins detected, evidence a
product-precursor relationship among proteins. three major sigma proteins
are evident viral particles. sigma(c) lowest molecular weight, part
of outer capsid virion, appears homologous mammalian
sigma(1) protein. interestingly, demonstrates greatest polymorphism all
the polypeptides among different avian reoviruses examined. sigma(b) (36,000 
daltons) major constituent outer capsid and, like sigma(c), is
exposed surface virion. sigma(a) (39,000 daltons) appears 
internal protein. additional polypeptide band sigma class an
apparent molecular weight 34,000 35,000 seen three different
conditions: (i) s1133 reovirus preparations, particularly prolonged
storage, new band (sigma(b')) appears reduction intensity of
sigma(b), suggesting sigma(b') degradation product sigma(b); (ii) in
polypeptides immunoprecipitated infected-cell extracts, major band
(sigma(ns)) apparent migrating ahead sigma(b); (iii) top component 
preparations avian reoviruses examined, band (sigma(tc)) mobility
identical sigma(ns) represents major constitutent appears 
incorporated within particle itself. relationship among three bands
is currently known. avian reovirus polypeptides thus general similar
to found mammalian reoviruses, differences exist may be
important understanding viral structure assembly.
