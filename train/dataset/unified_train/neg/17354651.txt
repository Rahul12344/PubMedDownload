the antiviral activity iminocyclitol compounds deoxynojirimycin (dnj)
head group either straight chain alkyl alkylcycloalkyl group attached to
the nitrogen atom tested vitro multiple-enveloped viruses.
several analogues superior previously reported dnj compounds.
iminocyclitols inhibit glycan-processing enzyme endoplasmic-reticular
glucosidase shown inhibit morphogenesis viruses bud from
the endoplasmic reticulum (er) non-cytotoxic concentrations. bovine viral
diarrhoea virus (bvdv) used surrogate system study the
hepatitis c virus, belong virus family (flaviviridae) west nile
virus (wnv) dengue virus (dv). n-nonyl-dnj (nndnj) previously reported to
have micromolar antiviral activity bvdv, limiting toxicity profile.
n-butylcyclohexyl-dnj (sp169) shown potent nndnj assays
against bvdv less toxic. however, inactive hepatitis b virus
(hbv). present study reports efforts improve performance profiles of
these compounds. introduction oxygen atom n-alkyl side chain of
dnj, either ether hydroxyl functionality, reduced toxicity but
sacrificed potency. introduction hydroxyl group tertiary carbon
junction cycloalkyl linear alkyl group, in
n-pentyl-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-dnj (osl-9511), led structure as
well tolerated dnj (cc50>500 microm), retained micromolar antiviral
activity er morphogenesis budding viruses tested: bvdv, wnv, dv and
hbv. implication modification development broad-spectrum
antiviral agents discussed.
