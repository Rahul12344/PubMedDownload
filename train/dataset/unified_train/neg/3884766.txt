the efficacy immunosuppressive treatment evaluated group 15
children (aged 2-10 years) affected clinically asymptomatic, biochemically
mild, hbsag-positive, delta-antibody-negative, histologically moderate, chronic
active hepatitis (cah). clinical, biochemical, serological, histological
features chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection studied a
follow-up 2 years. eight 15 patients received immunosuppressive treatment
(prednisone plus azathioprine); seven received placebo. significant
differences found among treated untreated patients, overall
improvement nearly parameters disease (aminotransferases, albumin,
prothrombin time, immunoglobulins, bromsulphalein 45 min, bile acid serum 
levels) found groups. treated patients showed improvement in
aminotransferase levels first 3-month checkup. finding, however,
was statistically significant study disappeared subsequent
follow-up examinations. high incidence hbeag noted entry the
study (10 15 patients checked). hbeag seroconversion observed two of
the six hbeag-positive treated patients two four hbeag-positive
untreated patients. finally, histological picture showed similar patterns 
both groups patients studied. data suggest benefit from
immunosuppressive therapy proven time asymptomatic, moderately 
active, hbsag-positive, delta-negative cah children.
