human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) persists subclinical, lifelong infection the
normal human host, reactivation latency immunocompromised subjects
results serious disease. latency reactivation defining characteristics
of herpesviruses key understanding biology; however, the
precise cellular sites hcmv carried mechanisms regulating its
latency reactivation natural infection remain poorly understood. 
we present evidence, based entirely direct analysis material isolated 
healthy virus carriers, show myeloid dendritic cell (dc) progenitors 
sites hcmv latency ex vivo differentiation mature dc
phenotype linked reactivation infectious virus resulting from
differentiation-dependent chromatin remodeling viral major immediate-early
promoter. thus, myeloid dc progenitors site hcmv latency natural 
persistence, critical linkage differentiation dc 
and transcriptional reactivation latent virus, likely play an
important role pathogenesis hcmv infection.
