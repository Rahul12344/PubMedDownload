antibodies human t-cell lymphotropic virus type iii (htlv-iii) first
detected 1979 serum samples 30 known seropositive patients with
hemophilia, half seroconverted 1981-1982. lymphadenopathy was
present 70% seropositive three years, compared 10% who
were seropositive three years less. t-helper cell counts low (307 +/- 64 
cells/cu mm) early seroconverters, normal late seroconverters. 
t-suppressor cell counts related year seroconversion. long
latency period seroconversion suggests ongoing indolent process, rather 
than acute infection. remains determined whether aberrant 
part immune response initiated htlv-iii antigens result a
chronic active htlv-iii infection.
