twenty-six patients, positive hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag), hepatitis 
b e antigen (hbeag), hepatitis b virus (hbv)-deoxyribonucleic acid (dna), dna
polymerase activity, treated human lymphoblastoid interferon
(ifn-alpha) human fibroblast interferon (ifn-beta) enoxolone glycoside
(glycyrrhizinic acid), given four weeks withdrawn. interferons
were given continuously four weeks. four months treatment, six of
12 patients treated ifn-alpha hbeag-negative hbv-dna-negative 
while three 14 patients treated ifn-beta hbv-dna-negative one
was hbeag-negative. none ten untreated control patients became negative
for either hbeag hbv-dna. patients studied remained hbsag-positive. both
interferons generally well tolerated. persistent low-grade fever was
reported patients ifn-beta group hair weight loss were
more common ifn-alpha group. results indicate combination 
enoxolone glycoside withdrawal ifn-alpha treatment reduces hbv replication
more effectively interferon alone.
