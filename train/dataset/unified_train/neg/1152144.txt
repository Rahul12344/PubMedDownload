the structure composition core adenovirus type 2 analyzed by
electron microscopy biochemical techniques differential degradation 
the virion heat, pyridine, sarcosyl treatment. negatively stained 
preparations purified sarcosyl cores reveal spherical subunits 21.6-nm
diameter electron microscope. suggested subunits are
organized icosahedron axes symmetry coincident 
of viral capsid. subunits connected viral dna molecule. the
sarcosyl cores contain viral dna predominantly arginine/alanine-rich 
core polypeptide vii. sarcosyl cores spread protein film, tightly
coiled particles observed gradually unfold giving rise a
rosette-like pattern due uncoiling dna molecule. completely unfolded dna
molecules circular. pyridine cores consist viral dna polypeptides 
v vii. negatively stained preparations pyridine cores subunit
arrangement apparent sarcosyl cores masked additional shell which
is probably formed polypeptide v. freeze-cleaved preparations the
adenovirion two fracture planes recognized. one fracture plane probably
passes outer capsid virion polypeptide v exposing a
subviral particle corresponds pyridine core. second fracture
plane observed could located polypeptide v polypeptide vii-dna
complex, thus uncovering subviral structure corresponds sarcosyl
core. sarcosyl core polypeptide vii tightly bound viral dna
which susceptible digestion dnase. restriction endonuclease ecori 
cleaves viral dna sarcosyl cores six specific fragments.
these fragments resolved polyacrylamide-agarose gels provided the
sarcosyl cores treated pronase incubation restriction
endonuclease. pronase digestion omitted, complex terminal ecori 
fragments adenovirus dna protein isolated. complex the
terminal dna fragments liberated pronase treatment. complex
described presumably responsible circularization viral dna
inside virion. nature protein(s) involved circle formation 
not yet elucidated.
