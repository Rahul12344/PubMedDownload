hiv-1 infection neonates results extended acute period virus
replication, frequent neurological problems reduced survival compared to
adults. adults, r5 viruses mainly infect ccr5(+) cd4(+) memory t-cells. in
neonates, ccr5(+) memory t-cells form substantially smaller fraction total
lymphocytes. therefore tested whether alternative coreceptors confer infection
of lymphocytes pediatric isolates. pediatric hiv-1 r5 isolates failed to
replicate delta32/delta32 ccr5 pbmcs cord pbmcs treated ccr5
inhibitor. results indicate role alternative coreceptors and
provide support ccr5 inhibitors therapy hiv-1(+) neonates.
