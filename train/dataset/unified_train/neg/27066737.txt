lymphangiogenesis plays pivotal role diverse pathological conditions. here, 
we demonstrate carbohydrate-binding protein, galectin-8, promotes
pathological lymphangiogenesis. galectin-8 markedly upregulated inflamed
human mouse corneas, galectin-8 inhibitors reduce inflammatory
lymphangiogenesis. mouse model corneal allogeneic transplantation,
galectin-8-induced lymphangiogenesis associated increased rate of
corneal graft rejection. further, murine model herpes simplex virus
keratitis, corneal pathology lymphangiogenesis ameliorated lgals8(-/-)
mice. mechanistically, vegf-c-induced lymphangiogenesis significantly reduced 
in lgals8(-/-) pdpn(-/-) mice; likewise, galectin-8-induced
lymphangiogenesis reduced pdpn(-/-) mice. interestingly, knockdown of
vegfr-3 affect galectin-8-mediated lymphatic endothelial cell (lec)
sprouting. instead, inhibiting integrins α1β1 α5β1 curtails galectin-8- 
and vegf-c-mediated lec sprouting. together, study uncovers unique
molecular mechanism lymphangiogenesis galectin-8-dependent crosstalk 
among vegf-c, podoplanin integrin pathways plays key role.
