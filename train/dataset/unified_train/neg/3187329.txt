using reverse plaque forming cell (pfc) assay production immunoglobulin 
(ig) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mncs) vitro studied 12
patients wegener's granulomatosis (wg). spontaneous igg production was
increased two six untreated patients. igg response mncs eight
untreated patients pokeweed mitogen (pwm) epstein-barr virus (ebv)
stimulation significantly depressed. igm iga production followed 
individual pattern igg. blood b-cell t-cell subset concentrations were
normal therapy, whereas monocyte concentration increased four
of six patients. titers anti-neutrophil cytoplasm autoantibodies (ancas) did
not correlate spontaneous induced ig production blood leukocyte 
subset concentrations. biopsy specimens upper respiratory tract lesions in
seven untreated patients showed numerous macrophages, activated lymphocytes,
and plasma cells, suggesting pathogenetic role cells the
