cephalosporin susceptibility among neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates--united states,
2000-2010.

centers disease control prevention (cdc).

neisseria gonorrhoeae major cause pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic
pregnancy, infertility, facilitate human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) transmission. emergence gonococcal resistance penicillin and
tetracycline occurred 1970s became widespread early
1980s. recently, resistance fluoroquinolones developed. resistance was
documented first asia, emerged united states hawaii followed by
other western states. became prevalent regions united
states. hawaii, fluoroquinolone resistance first noted among
heterosexuals; however, resistance united states initially became
prevalent among men sex men (msm) generalizing to
heterosexuals. emergence resistance led cdc, 2007, discontinue
recommending fluoroquinolone regimens treatment gonorrhea. cdc now
recommends dual therapy gonorrhea cephalosporin (ceftriaxone 250 mg)
plus either azithromycin doxycycline. report summarizes trends in
cephalosporin susceptibility among n. gonorrhoeae isolates united states
during 2000-2010 using data gonococcal isolate surveillance project
(gisp). period, percentage isolates elevated minimum
inhibitory concentrations (mics) cephalosporins (≥0.25 µg/ml cefixime 
≥0.125 µg/ml ceftriaxone) increased 0.2% 2000 1.4% 2010 for
cefixime 0.1% 2000 0.3% 2010 ceftriaxone. although
cephalosporins remain effective treatment gonococcal infections,
health-care providers vigilant treatment failure requested 
to report occurrence state local health departments. state local
public health departments promote maintenance laboratory capability 
culture n. gonorrhoeae allow testing isolates cephalosporin resistance.
they also develop enhanced surveillance response protocols for
gonorrhea treatment failures report gonococcal treatment failures cdc.
