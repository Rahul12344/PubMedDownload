human embryonic lung (hel) cells infected human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)
restricted replication herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1). delay hsv
replication 15 h well consistent, almost 3 log inhibition hsv
replication hcmv-infected cell cultures harvested 24 72 h after
superinfection observed compared controls infected hsv alone.
treatment hcmv-infected hel cells cycloheximide (100 micrograms/ml) 3
or 24 h, conditions known result accumulation hcmv immediate-early and
early mrna, demonstrated effective blocking hcmv protein synthesis, as
shown immunoprecipitation hcmv antibody-positive polyvalent serum.
cycloheximide treatment hcmv-infected hel cells removal the
cycloheximide block superinfection inhibited hsv-1 replication more
efficiently non-drug-treated superinfected controls. hcmv dna-negative
temperature-sensitive mutants restricted hsv efficiently wild-type hcmv
suggesting immediate-early and/or early events occur viral dna 
synthesis sufficient inhibition hsv. inhibition hsv-1 in
hcmv-infected hel cells unaffected elevated temperature (40.5 degrees c). 
however, prior uv irradiation hcmv removed block hsv replication,
demonstrating requirement active hcmv genome. hsv-2 replication was
similarly inhibited hcmv-infected hel cells. however, replication of
adenovirus, another dna virus, restricted cells same
conditions. superinfection hcmv-infected hel cells hsv-1 labeled with
[3h]thymidine provided evidence labeled virus could penetrate the
nucleus cells superinfection. evidence penetration superinfecting
hsv hcmv-infected cells also provided blot hybridization hsv dna
synthesized cells infected hsv alone versus superinfected cell cultures
at 0 48 h superinfection. addition, superinfection vesicular
stomatitis virus ruled role interferon restriction hsv
replication system.
