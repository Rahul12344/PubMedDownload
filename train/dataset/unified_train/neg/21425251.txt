production vectors derived adeno-associated virus (aavv) insect cells 
represents feasible option large-scale applications. however, transducing
particles yields obtained system low compared total capsid
yields, suggesting presence genome encapsidation bottlenecks. three
components required aavv production: viral capsid proteins (vp), the
recombinant aav genome, rep proteins aav genome replication and
encapsidation. little known interaction three components
in insect cells, intracellular conditions different in
mammalian cells. work, localization aav proteins insect cells
was assessed first time purpose finding potential limiting
factors. unassembled vp located either cytoplasm nucleus.
their transport nucleus dependent protein concentration. empty
capsids located defined subnuclear compartments. rep proteins expressed
individually efficiently translocated nucleus. intranuclear
distribution uniform differed vp distribution. rep52
distribution expression levels affected aav genomes vp, rep78 
distribution stability changed coexpression. expression aav
components modified capsid intranuclear distribution, assembled vp found
in vesicles located nuclear periphery. vesicles related to
baculovirus infection, highlighting role aavv production insect cells. 
the results obtained work suggest intracellular distribution 
aav proteins allows interaction limit vector production in
insect cells.
