the mechanism hepatitis c virus (hcv) clearance direct-acting antivirals
(daas) eliminate risk hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) among
patients advanced cirrhosis unclear. many viral bacterial infections 
degrade p53 favor cell survival adapt endoplasmic reticulum
(er)-stress response. study, examined whether hcv clearance by
interferon-alpha daas normalizes er stress restores expression 
p53 tumor suppressor cell culture. found hcv infection induces chronic
er stress unfolded protein response untransformed primary human
hepatocytes. unfolded protein response induces chaperone-mediated autophagy
(cma) infected primary human hepatocytes huh-7.5 cells results in
degradation p53 induced expression mouse double minute 2 (mdm2).
inhibition p53/mdm2 interactions small molecule (nutlin-3) silencing
mdm2 rescue p53 degradation, indicating hcv infection induces
degradation p53 independent mdm2 pathway. interestingly, found 
hcv infection degrades p53 lysosome-dependent mechanism because
lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a silencing restored p53 degradation. our
results show hcv clearance induced interferon-alpha-based antiviral
therapies normalizes er-stress response restores p53, whereas hcv
clearance daas neither. show decreased expression p53 in
hcv-infected cirrhotic liver associated expression chaperones
associated er stress cma response. conclusion: hcv-induced er stress
and cma promote p53 degradation advanced liver cirrhosis. hcv clearance by
daas restore p53, provides potential explanation viral
cure daas eliminate hcc risk among patients advanced liver
disease. propose resolving er-stress response alternative
approach reducing hcc risk among patients cirrhosis viral cure.
