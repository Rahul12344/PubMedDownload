genotype iii (giii) japanese encephalitis virus (jev) predominance gradually 
been replaced genotype (gi) last 20 years many asian countries. 
this genotype shift raises concerns protective efficacy japanese
encephalitis (je) vaccines, currently licensed je vaccines are
derived giii strains. study, conducted vaccination-challenge
protection assays evaluate cross-protective efficacy gi- or
giii-derived vaccines challenge heterologous genotype using a
mouse challenge model. titration neutralizing antibodies elicited by
sa14-14-2 live-attenuated je vaccine (sa14-14-2 vaccine), giii-derived vaccine,
indicated titer neutralizing antibodies specific heterologous
genotype gi stain significantly lower specific homologous
genotype giii strain pigs mice immunized sa14-14-2 vaccine. 
vaccination mice sa14-14-2 vaccine giii-inactivated vaccine high 
and medium doses completely protected vaccinated mice challenge 
homologous genotype giii strains, failed provide vaccinated mice
complete protection challenge heterologous genotype gi strains.
the protection rates gi strain challenge 60%-80%, showing these
vaccines partially protective gi strain challenge. additionally,
vaccination mice gi-inactivated vaccine conferred 100% protection
against challenge homologous genotype gi strains, 50%-90% protection
against challenge heterologous genotype giii strains, showing reduced
protective efficacy gi-derived vaccine giii strain challenge.
overall, observations demonstrated partial cross-protection gi
and giii strains suggested potential need new je vaccine strategies,
including options like bivalent vaccine, control genotype infection.
