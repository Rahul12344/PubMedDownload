strains feline immunodeficiency virus (fiv) presently investigation 
exhibit distinct patterns vitro tropism. particular, adaptation of
fiv propagation crandell feline kidney (crfk) cells results the
selection strains capable forming syncytia cell lines diverse
species origin. infection crfk cells crfk-adapted strains appears to
require chemokine receptor cxcr4 inhibited natural ligand,
stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (sdf-1alpha). found inhibitors of
cxcr4-mediated infection human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1), 
the bicyclam amd3100 short peptides derived amino-terminal region of
sdf-1alpha, also blocked infection crfk fiv. nevertheless, observed
differences ranking order peptides inhibitors fiv hiv-1
and showed differences related species origin cxcr4 and
not viral envelope. results suggest that, although envelope
glycoproteins fiv hiv-1 substantially divergent, fiv hiv-1
interact cxcr4 highly similar manner. also addressed role
of cxcr4 life cycle primary isolates fiv. various cxcr4 ligands
inhibited infection feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) by
primary fiv isolates concentration-dependent manner. ligands also
blocked viral transduction feline pbmc pseudotyped viral particles when
infection mediated envelope glycoprotein primary fiv isolate 
not g protein vesicular stomatitis virus, indicating act at
an envelope-mediated step presumably viral entry. findings strongly 
suggest primary crfk-adapted strains fiv, despite disparate vitro 
tropisms, share usage cxcr4.
