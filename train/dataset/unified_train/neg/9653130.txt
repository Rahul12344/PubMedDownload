signal transductions dual-function cxcr4 ccr5 chemokine receptors/hiv 
type 1 (hiv-1) coreceptors electrophysiologically monitored xenopus
laevis oocytes also coexpressed viral receptor cd4 g
protein-coupled inward-rectifying k+ channel (kir 3.1). large kir 3.1-dependent
currents generated response corresponding chemokines (sdf-1alpha for
cxcr4 mip-1alpha; mip-1beta rantes ccr5) blocked pertussis
toxin, suggesting involvement inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. 
prolonged exposures chemokines caused substantial incomplete
desensitization responses time constants 5-7 min recovery time
constants 12-19 min. cxcr4 ccr5 exhibited heterologous desensitization 
this oocyte system, suggesting possible inhibition common downstream step in
their signaling pathways. contrast chemokines, perfusion monomeric 
oligomeric preparations glycoprotein mr 120, 000 (gp120) derived from
several isolates hiv-1 activate signaling cxcr4 ccr5 regardless 
of cd4 coexpression. however, adsorption gp120 t-cell-tropic virus 
resulted cd4-dependent antagonism cxcr4 response sdf-1alpha, whereas
gp120 macrophage-tropic viruses caused cd4-dependent antagonism ccr5
response mip-1alpha. antagonisms could partially overcome high
concentrations chemokines specific coreceptors the
corresponding hiv-1 isolates, suggesting resulted direct
interactions gp120-cd4 complexes coreceptors not
involve desensitization pathway. results indicate monomeric or
oligomeric gp120s specifically antagonize cxcr4 ccr5 signaling response to
chemokines, exclude possibility gp120s might also
function weak agonists cells. gp120-mediated disruption cxcr4
and ccr5 signaling may contribute aids pathogenesis.
