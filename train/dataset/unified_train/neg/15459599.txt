background: aim study investigate influence prior
cytomegalovirus (cmv) chlamydia pneumoniae (cp) infection prognosis after
percutaneous coronary intervention (pci).
methods: using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique preprocedural
anti-cmv immunoglobulin g anti-cp immunoglobulin (cp iga), immunoglobulin
m, immunoglobulin g antibodies measured. repeat anginal complaints and
major adverse clinical events (mace), including pci, coronary artery bypass
grafting, myocardial infarction, death, recorded 8-month follow-up.
results: six hundred consecutive patients included successful pci.
sixty-four percent patients stented. mean age 61.6 years, and
68.9% male. rate seropositivity cp iga patients mace as
compared patients without mace 50.9% versus 35.4% (p =.0276). in
patients repeat anginal complaints, cp iga seropositivity 41.6% versus
34.6% patients without repeat angina (p =.1057). negative effect cp 
prognosis confirmed calculating odds ratios mace (1.9, 95% ci
1.1-3.3). rates seropositivity anti-cmv immunoglobulin g not
significantly different groups, although found association
between infectious burden repeat angina pectoris (odds ratio 1.8, 95% ci
1.1-3.0).
conclusions: conclude preprocedural seropositivity cp iga risk
factor mace angina pectoris pci. although relation was
found cmv alone, cumulative infectious burden also related these
clinical manifestations restenosis.
