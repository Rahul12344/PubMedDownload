the spatial distribution charged residues protein interest with
respect potential electrostatic interactions. examined proteins of
a large number representative eukaryotic prokaryotic viruses the
occurrence significant clusters, runs, periodic patterns charge.
clusters runs positive charge prominent many capsid core
proteins, whereas surface (glyco)proteins frequently contain negative charge
cluster. significant charge configurations abundant regulatory proteins
implicated transcriptional transactivation cellular transformation.
proteins charge structures much predominant animal dna viruses
as compared animal rna viruses prokaryotic viruses. contrast might
reflect role protein charge structures facilitating competitive
virus-host interactions involving cellular transcription, translation,
protein sorting, transport apparatus.
