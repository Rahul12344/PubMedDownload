lassa fever afflicts tens thousands people west africa annually. the
rapid progression patients febrile illness fulminant syndrome and
death provides incentive development clinical prognostic markers 
guide case management. small molecule profile serum febrile patients 
triaged viral hemorrhagic fever ward kenema government hospital in
sierra leone assessed using untargeted ultra high performance liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry. physiological dysregulation resulting from
lassa virus (lasv) infection occurs small molecule level. effects lasv 
infection pathways mediating blood coagulation, lipid, amino acid, nucleic
acid metabolism manifest changes levels numerous metabolites 
the circulation. several compounds, including platelet activating factor (paf),
paf-like molecules products heme breakdown emerged candidates may 
prove useful diagnostic assays inform better care lassa fever patients.
