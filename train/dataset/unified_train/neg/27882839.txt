background: direct-acting antivirals (daa) treatment hepatitis c virus
(hcv) drastically improved outcomes also costly. this
reason, priority treatment often given patients higher fibrosis 
score baseline payers providers rather treating eligible
patients. simulation studies suggested waiting treat patients 
fibrosis 3-4 may costly result worse outcomes; however, real-world
implications unknown.
objective: determine drug costs outcomes treating hepatitis c in
patients fibrosis scores 0-2 3-4 baseline real-world
ambulatory care setting.
methods: total 322 patients 36 clinical sites massachusetts hcv
genotype 1-4 prescription least 1 daa medication may 2011
and october 2015 included. retrospective prospective chart reviews 
completed primary investigator. data collected april 2016.
the primary outcome study determine mean drug cost per
sustained virologic response (svr) achieved patients fibrosis scores 
0-2 3-4. drug costs calculated using average wholesale price only
included cost hcv medications, adjunctive medications, blood work,
hospitalizations, anticipated complications, projected medical
costs.
results: mean ± sd (median) drug cost per patient $130,391 ± 46,787
(113,400) completed treatment duration 15.0 ± 8.9 (12) weeks. mean
drug cost per svr $155,662 patients mean drug cost per svr 
$122,452 $178,401 patients fibrosis scores 0-2 3-4,
respectively. svr rates 83.5% (269/322) patients 92.2% (107/116)
and 78.6% (162/206) patients fibrosis scores 0-2 3-4,
respectively. ledipasvir/ sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir + ribavirin;
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir + ribavirin; sofos-buvir + interferon + ribavirin;
boceprevir + interferon + ribavirin; sofosbu-vir + simeprevir; telaprevir +
interferon + ribavirin mean drug cost per svr $123,559; $153,347;
$157,969; $184,800; $248,640; $251,550; $373,333; respectively.
conclusions: real-world knowledge outcomes drug costs may influence
future decisions. studies needed evaluate emerging treatment
options reflect changes treatment guidelines.

conflicts interest. data study presented poster ashp
