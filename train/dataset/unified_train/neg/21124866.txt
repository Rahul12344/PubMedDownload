for hiv-infected patients, antiretroviral therapy controls viral
replication. however, patients drug resistance cause therapy fail.
nonetheless, continued therapy failing regimen preserve even lead
to increases cd4+ cell counts. understand biological basis these
observations, used mathematical models explain observations made in
patients drug-resistant hiv treated enfuvirtide (enf/t-20), hiv-1
fusion inhibitor. due resistance emergence, enf removed drug
regimen, drug-sensitive virus regrown, enf re-administered. used our
model study dynamics plasma-viral rna cd4+ cell levels, the
competition drug-sensitive resistant viruses therapy
interruption re-administration. focusing resistant viruses carrying the
v38a mutation gp41, found enf-resistant virus 17Â±3% less fit than
enf-sensitive virus absence drug, loss resistant
virus therapy interruption primarily due fitness cost. using
viral dynamic parameters estimated patients, show although
re-administration enf cannot suppress viral load, can, presence of
resistant virus, increase cd4+ cell counts, yield clinical
benefits. study provides framework investigate hiv cell dynamics 
in patients develop drug resistance antiretroviral agents may
help develop effective strategies treatment.
