the abundant polyadenylated viral transcripts epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-associated tumor nasopharyngeal carcinoma family (apparent sizes,
4.8, 5.2, 6.2, 7.0 kb) highly spliced cytoplasmic rnas expressed 
bamhi-i -a regions viral genome antisense direction respect
to several viral lytic functions encoded within region concerned
with lytic cycle virus. called complementary-strand
transcripts. also expressed b cells, including burkitt's lymphoma and
ebv-immortalized marmoset cell lines, tumors generated cottontop tamarins 
in response ebv infection, lower level. complete structure the
major 4.8-kb rnas (seven eight exons) determined study; the
larger, related, transcripts appear produced differential splicing. 
the transcriptional promoter major complementary-strand transcripts,
located bamhi-i, contains several well-characterized transcriptional control
elements (e2a, sp1, ap1) functionally active b lymphocytes and
epithelial cells. appears bifunctional viral promoter, also
contains initiation codon gene (bilf2) encodes glycoprotein that
is expressed strand. splicing events create number small
aug-initiated open reading frames, one homology functionally
significant regions ebv-encoded nuclear antigen 2 e2 (in
papillomavirus). complex nature transcripts potential role
in virus association malignancy considered.
