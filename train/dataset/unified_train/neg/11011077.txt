to determine antiviral effects drugs targeted hepatitis c virus (hcv)
in chronic hepatitis patients, accurate quantitative method high
sensitivity needed. reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr) sensitive method detection hcv sequences in
clinical specimens. however, method quantitative. purpose, a
quantitative competitive assay developed combines rt pcr followed by
image analysis quantify hcv rna. assay targets highly conserved 5'
non-coding region hcv based co-amplification wild type hcv
rna known amounts mutant synthetic rna. mutant internal control used 
in experiments differs wild type rna two nucleotide
substitutions, introduces internal restriction enzyme site. this
report, method used determine levels positive strand rna 11
hcv positive hepatocellular carcinomas (hcc) compared adjacent
non-tumorous liver tissue. confirm difference viral titers 
related variations amount rna used assay, glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) mrna also assessed competitive rt-pcr in
all tissue extracts. using competitive assay determined hcv rna 
levels liver tumor samples ranged 10(3) 10(6) molecules per
microg total rna similar previous reports. interestingly, the
amount hcv non-tumorous liver specimens found be
significantly higher (p<0.05) surrounding tumors, gapdh mrna
levels found similar liver tumor. competitive rt-pcr 
sensitive, accurate reliable method determine hcv titers clinical
specimens. using method determined malignant tumor cells harbor 
less hcv compared surrounding non-tumorous liver cells.
