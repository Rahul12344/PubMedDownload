objective: compare response nevirapine (nvp)-based highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart) hiv-infected ugandan children, exposed and
nonexposed single-dose nvp (sd nvp) birth.
methods: hiv-infected study children initiated stavudine/lamivudine/nvp
as fixed dose combination. cd4 cell percent hiv-1 rna documented at
baseline, 12, 24, 36, 48 weeks post-initiation haart.
results: ninety-two children enrolled study, 44 sd nvp-exposed
and 48 nonexposed cohort. median age enrollment 1.7 years
[interquartile range (iqr) 1.2-2.4] 7.8 years (iqr 5.9-9.2) sd
nvp-exposed nonexposed cohorts,respectively (p < 0.001). baseline week
48 post-haart, median cd4 cell percentages 14% 33% the
nvp-exposed group 8% 22.5% nonexposed group (p < 0.0001). the
median (iqr) viral load baseline 650,568 (359,979-2,086,613) rna copies/ml
and 239,027 (105,904-494,813) rna copies/ml nvp-exposed nonexposed
cohorts, respectively. 48 weeks haart, 76% nvp-exposed 80% of
the nonexposed children median viral load < 400 copies/ml (p = 0.74).
conclusions: hiv-infected ugandan older infants children were
exposed exposed sd nvp birth favorable treatment outcomes on
nvp-containing haart.
