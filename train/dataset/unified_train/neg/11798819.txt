objective: identify 'b domain' mutations polymerase gene its
relationship drug resistance treatment famciclovir chinese
chronic asymptomatic hbv carriers.
methods: sequential sera 29 chinese chronic hbeag positive hbv carriers
treated combination therapy thymosin alpha1 (talpha1) plus famciclovir 
and also 15 cases treated talpha1 alone, studied. nucleotide
sequences encoding 'b' 'c domain' hbv polymerase gene determined 
by direct cloning sequencing methods.
results: nine talpha1 plus fcv-treated none talpha1 treated patients
developed mutations 'b domain' polymerase gene could result in
amino acid changes. development 'b domain' mutations, treatment,
was significantly associated hbv dna rebound received talpha1
plus fcv.
conclusions: mutations fcv-treated patients resulting amino acid changes
mainly cluster 'b domain' polymerase gene rather ymdd motif.
the presence mutations significantly associated hbv dna rebound during
treatment.
