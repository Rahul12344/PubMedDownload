metastasis considered obvious mark aggressive cancers. however,
little known molecular mechanism regulation cancer
metastasis. recent evidence increasingly suggests interaction between
chemokines chemokine receptors pivotal process metastasis. the
chemokine receptor cxcr4 ligand cxcl12, example, reported
to play vital role cancer metastasis. another chemokine chemokine
receptor pair, cxcl16/cxcr6 axis, studied several independent
research groups. here, summarize recent advances knowledge the
function cxc chemokine receptor cxcr6 ligand cxcl16 regulating
metastasis invasion cancer. cxcr6 cxcl16 up-regulated multiple 
cancer tissue types cancer cell lines relative normal tissues cell
lines. addition, cxcr6 cxcl16 levels increase tumor malignancy
increases. trans-membranous cxcl16 chemokine reduces proliferation soluble 
cxcl16 chemokine enhances proliferation migration. tm-cxcl16 functions 
inducer lymphocyte build-up around tumor sites. high trans-membranous cxcl16 
expression correlates good prognosis. moreover, akt/mtor signal
pathway involved activating cxcr6/cxcl16 axis. findings suggest
multiple opportunities blocking cxcr6/cxcl16 axis akt/mtor signal
pathway novel cancer therapies.
