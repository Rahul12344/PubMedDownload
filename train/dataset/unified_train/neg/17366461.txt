background: antiretroviral therapy (art) reduces human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) rna load probability transmitting hiv hiv-uninfected
partner. however, potential reduction secondary transmission associated
with art may offset longer duration infectiousness.
methods: estimate effects art secondary transmission hiv
among men sex men, used previously published state-transition 
model hiv disease simulate clinical virologic course hiv
infection among 2 cohorts men sex men: (1) cohort of
individuals receiving art (2) cohort individuals treated
with us guideline-concordant art. model tracked number acts of
unprotected insertive anal intercourse, transmission risk per act determined
by hiv rna level, number secondary cases generated cohort.
results: estimated mean number secondary transmissions an
hiv-infected individual 10, 20, 30 years infection 1.9, 2.5,
and 2.5, respectively, untreated cohort, compared 1.4, 1.8, 2.3, 
respectively, treated cohort. total number transmissions the
treated cohort began exceed total number transmissions the
untreated cohort 33 years infection; entire course infection,
treatment art led 23% increase secondary infections. estimates
of impact art secondary transmission sensitive changes risk 
behaviors.
conclusions: results suggest art must accompanied effective
hiv-related risk reduction interventions. programs target prevention to
decrease hiv transmission crucial epidemic control.
