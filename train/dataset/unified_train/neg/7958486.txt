experiments progress engineer herpes simplex virus type 1 gene
transfer vector nervous system. virus well suited this
purpose due ability persist long periods latent state in
neurons wherein lytic genes inactive unique viral promoter capable
of inducing transcription latent viral genome. virus highly
cytotoxic neurons, however, thus genes initiate lytic cycle
must deleted genome order force virus latency.
candidate genes include immediately early functions icp0, icp27, icp4 the
virus host shut-off function. design suitable promoter regulator capable
of expressing foreign genes latency must also developed. many promoters
including strong viral promoters neuronal-specific cellular promoters have
proved inadequate due transient nature activity the
viral vector genome viral latency promoter region appears weakly
active brain. current efforts concern development auto-regulatable
promoters remain active even viral genome bound chromatin.
