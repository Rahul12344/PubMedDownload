c.b-17 mice severe combined immune deficiency (scid) mutation were
infected naturally occurring murine polyomavirus. using polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) technique, persistence polyomavirus followed in
different tissues mice 24 hours 2 months post infection
(p.i.). viral dna appeared 3-5 days detected studied organs 
3 weeks p.i. 4 weeks 2 months p.i. viral dna present high levels
in studied organs animals. controls normal c.b-17 a/sn
mice used. viral dna appeared 2-4 days. infection reached peak
around 1 week p.i. followed clearing stage viral dna no
longer detectable 4-5 weeks p.i. organs studied pcr also
examined histologically, lesions observed. consequently persistence
and organ distribution polyomavirus adult scid mice differs greatly from
that normal adult mice.
