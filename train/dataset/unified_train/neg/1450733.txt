the feasibility applying molecular phylogenetic methods analysis aligned
coat-protein sequences molecular data derived coat proteins or
genomic sequences members proposed taxonomic family potyviridae, 
discussed. show comparative sequence analysis whole coat-protein
sequences may used reliably differentiate sequences closely
related strains, show groupings distantly related viruses; that
coat proteins putative potyviridae cluster according proposed generic
divisions, and, even distantly related, members 
family form cluster distinct coat proteins filamentous and
rod-shaped viruses. taxonomic revisions based perceived evolutionary
relationships, lack feasibility erecting higher taxa these
viruses, discussed.
