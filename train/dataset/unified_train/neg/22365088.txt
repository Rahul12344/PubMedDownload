quinolones considered big family multi-faceted drugs; chemical 
synthesis flexible easily adapted prepare new congeners with
rationally devised structures. shown description many thousands
of derivatives literature. scientists could accurately describe their
qsar, essential effective drug design. also gave the
chance discover new unprecedented activities, makes quinolones an
endless source hope enables development new clinically useful
drugs. quinolones among common frameworks present bioactive
molecules dominated market four decades. since 1962, 
4(1h)-quinolone-3-carboxylic acid derivatives widely used antibacterial
agents. quinolones broad potent spectrum activity also used
as second-line drugs treat tuberculosis (tb). recently, quinolones been
reported display "nonclassical" biological activities, antitumor,
anti-hiv-1 integrase, anti-hcv-ns3 helicase -ns5b-polymerase activities. 
present review focuses structural modifications responsible the
transformation antibacterial anticancer agent and/or antiviral
agent. indeed, quinolones' antimicrobial action distinguishable among
antibacterial agents, target different type ii topoisomerase
enzymes. many derivatives family show high activity bacterial
topoisomerases eukaryotic topoisomerases, also toxic cultured
mammalian cells vivo tumor models. moreover, quinolones shown
antiviral activity hiv hcv viruses. context quinolones
family drugs seem link three different biological activities
(antibacterial, anticancer, antiviral profiles) review also 
provide insight different mechanisms responsible activities
among different species.
