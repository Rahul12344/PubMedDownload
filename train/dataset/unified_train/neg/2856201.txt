liposomes, artificial membrane vesicles, intensively studied 
usefulness delivery vehicles vitro vivo. substantial progress has
been made development procedures liposome preparation, targeting
and delivery contents. broad flexibility available design of
the structure composition liposomes, coupled recent reports liposome
mediated gene transfer animals, suggest liposome technology poised
to utilized creation custom-designed cell-type-specific gene
transfer vehicles.
