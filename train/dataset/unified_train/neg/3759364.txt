the role virus-infected mononuclear leukocytes (mnls) pathogenesis of
neonatal herpetic chorioretinitis newborn rabbits investigated. early
as 2 days inoculating animals' skins type 2 herpes simplex virus
(hsv-2), infectious mnls infected animals' peripheral blood found.
the virus associated, part, mnls belonged to
phagocytic adherent cell fractions. observations electron microscopy
indicated hsv-2 actively replicating mnls. also found that
as 80 virus-infected mnls injected via right common carotoid artery
were capable inducing chorioretinal lesions 50% eyes, that
as many 10(3) pfu free virus required produce lesions in
the percentage eyes. result clearly indicated virus-infected
mnls far efficient producing chorioretinitis free virus, and
may thus play crucial role pathogenesis herpetic chorioretinitis in
newborn rabbits. 111in-labeled virus-infected uninfected mnls were
injected normal rabbits via right common carotid artery, the
virus-infected mnls localized readily eye uninfected mnls.
the virus-infected mnls also attached cultured vascular endothelial cells 
significantly often uninfected mnls. results suggested that
virus-infected mnls might easily trapped circulation eye and, in
this way, produce ocular lesions.
