hemolin specific immune protein belonging immunoglobulin superfamily 
firstly identified insects. growing evidences suggest hemolin be
activated bacterial viral infections may play important role in
antimicrobial immunity. paper, firstly identified hemolin-like
protein litopenaeus vannamei (lvhemolin). sequence analysis showed that
lvhemolin shares high similarity insect hemolins mainly composed of
seven immunoglobulin (ig) domains form 'horseshoe' tertiary structure.
tissue distribution analysis demonstrated lvhemolin mainly expressed in
stomach, gill, epithelium pyloric cecum l. vannamei. challenge 
pathogens stimulants, expression lvhemolin significantly up-regulated
in gill stomach. agglutination analysis demonstrated recombinant
lvhemolin protein purified escherichia coli could accelerate the
agglutination vibrio parahaemolyticus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, and
bacillus subtilis presence ca(2+). verify immune function of
lvhemolin vivo, shrimps injected gene-specific dsrna, followed by
challenge white spot syndrome virus (wssv) v. parahaemolyticus. the
results revealed silence lvhemolin could increase cumulative
mortalities shrimps challenged pathogens increase wssv copies in
shrimp tissues. suggested hemolin could play important role in
shrimp innate immune defense bacterial viral infections.
