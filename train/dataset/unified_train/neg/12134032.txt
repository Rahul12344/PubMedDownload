human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) glycoprotein us2 causes degradation major
histocompatibility complex (mhc) class heavy-chain (hc), class ii dr-alpha 
dm-alpha proteins, hfe, nonclassical mhc protein. us2-expressing cells, 
mhc proteins present endoplasmic reticulum (er) degraded cytosolic 
proteasomes. appears us2 binding triggers normal cellular pathway by
which misfolded aberrant proteins translocated er cytoplasmic 
proteasomes. better understand us2 binds mhc proteins causes their
degradation, constructed panel us2 mutants. mutants truncated n 
terminus far residue 40 c terminus amino acid 140 could bind
to class class ii proteins. nevertheless, mutants lacking the
cytosolic tail (residues 187 199) unable cause degradation both
class ii proteins. chimeric proteins constructed us2
sequences replaced homologous sequences us3, hcmv glycoprotein 
that also bind class ii proteins. one us2/us3 chimeras
bound class ii class i, second bound class hc better than
wild-type us2. therefore, us2 residues involved binding mhc class i
differ subtly involved binding class ii proteins. moreover, 
results demonstrate binding us2 class ii proteins not
sufficient cause degradation mhc proteins. cytosolic tail us2 and
certain us2 lumenal sequences, involved binding mhc proteins,
are required degradation. results consistent hypothesis that
us2 couples mhc proteins components er degradation pathway, enormously 
increasing rate degradation mhc proteins.
