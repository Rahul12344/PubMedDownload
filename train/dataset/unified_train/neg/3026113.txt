antibodies raised rabbits two synthetic peptides, 30
residues length, one corresponding predicted common carboxyl termini of
the nonstructural c c' proteins sendai virus unique
amino terminus larger c protein. peptide inoculated covalent
complex tetanus toxoid uncomplexed form. antibodies free
carboxyl-terminal peptide precipitated c c' proteins made vitro
translation viral mrna reacted c protein infected cells.
these results confirm c c' proteins carboxyl-coterminal.
contrasting reported colocalization intracellular measles virus c
proteins nucleocapsid inclusions, immunofluorescence studies revealed that
sendai virus c proteins uniformly distributed cytoplasm whereas the
viral p protein present inclusions mainly perinuclear. since
almost p protein molecules associated viral nucleocapsids, these
observations suggested sendai virus c protein molecules may both
nucleocapsid-associated free cytoplasm. interpretation was
supported c c' proteins found nucleocapsid free
protein fractions cell lysates. anti-c antibodies inhibit viral rna
synthesis added extract infected cells. result consistent 
with conclusion c proteins direct role viral
transcription, since virions lack c proteins transcriptionally active.
therefore, functions c proteins remain undefined.
