four species nonhuman primates inoculated intranasally 10(3.1) to
10(3.7) plaque forming units (pfu) respiratory syncytial (rs) virus. adults
squirrel monkeys newborn rhesus monkeys became infected shed small
quantities (peak titer 10(2.0) pfu/ml nasopharyngeal swab specimen) virus, 
but illness develop. infant cebus monkeys aged 2 months became infected, 
shed 10(2.3) 10(3.8) pfu/ml nasopharyngeal swab specimen, not
become ill. chimpanzees aged 15 18 months shed large quantity virus, up
to 10(6.0) pfu/ml nasopharyngeal swab specimen developed upper
respiratory illness. chimpanzees proposed possible animal model for
future study immunopathology rs virus disease vivo
evaluation attenuated live virus vaccine candidates.
