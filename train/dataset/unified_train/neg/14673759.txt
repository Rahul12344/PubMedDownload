liver-related mortality increasing problem human immunodeficiency virus 
(hiv)/hepatitis b virus (hbv)-coinfected patients receiving highly active
antiretroviral therapy (haart). hiv-negative patients, hbv chronicity is
associated reduction specific cell responses partially
restored treatment lamivudine. studied 5 hiv/hbv-coinfected patients
treated haart, either without addition drug specific
anti-hbv activity. data show reconstitution hbv-specific cell 
responses also occur hiv-positive patients reduction hbv load. 
this potential recover cell responses, thought critical
for hbv control, provides support addition anti-hbv therapy the
treatment hiv/hbv-coinfected patients.
