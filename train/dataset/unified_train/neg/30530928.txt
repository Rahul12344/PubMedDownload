multiple pathogens commonly co-occur animal populations, yet studies
demonstrate co-exposure individual hosts scales affect transmission.
although viruses genus ranavirus globally widespread, multiple
virus species strains likely co-occur nature, studies examined 
co-exposure affects infection dynamics larval amphibians. exposed
individual northern red-legged frog rana aurora larvae 2 species ranavirus,
namely ambystoma tigrinum virus (atv), frog virus 3 (fv3), fv3-like strain 
isolated frog-culturing facility georgia, usa (rcv-z2). compared
single-virus pairwise co-exposures experimentally accounting dosage.
co-exposure atv fv3-like strains resulted almost twice many infected
individuals compared single-virus exposures, suggesting effect of
co-exposure viral infectivity. viral load infected individuals exposed 
to atv fv3 also higher single-dose fv3 treatment, suggesting 
effect co-exposure viral replication. follow-up experiment, we
examined co-occurrence atv fv3 affected epizootics mesocosm
populations larval western chorus frogs pseudacris triseriata. although atv
did generally establish within host populations (<4% prevalence), atv
and fv3 present, co-exposure resulted larger epizootic of
fv3. results emphasize importance multi-pathogen interactions in
epizootic dynamics management implications natural commercial
amphibian populations.
