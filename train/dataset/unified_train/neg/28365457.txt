before introduction control programs 20th century, rabies in
domestic dogs occurred throughout western hemisphere. however, historical
records phylogenetic analysis multiple virus isolates indicate that,
before arrival first european colonizers, rabies virus likely
present bats skunks. canine rabies either rare absent among
domestic dogs native americans, first arrived many new dog breeds
were imported period european colonization. introduction the
cosmopolitan dog rabies lyssavirus variant marked expansion dog
population provided ideal conditions flourishing enzootic canine
rabies. shift dog-maintained viruses gray foxes, coyotes, skunks 
other wild mesocarnivores throughout americas mongooses the
caribbean augmented risk human rabies exposures complicated
control efforts. time, continued presence bat rabies poses
novel challenges absolute elimination canine human rabies. this
article compiles existing historical phylogenetic evidence origins and
subsequent dynamics rabies western hemisphere, era preceding
the arrival first european colonizers present day. companion
article reviews current status canine rabies control throughout the
western hemisphere steps required achieve maintain its
complete elimination (velasco-villa etÂ al., 2017).
