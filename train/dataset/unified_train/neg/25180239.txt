background: human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) combination antiretroviral
therapy (cart) may contribute higher prevalence osteoporosis and
osteopenia hiv-infected individuals.
methods: using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, compared lumbar spine, total 
hip, femoral neck bone mineral density (bmd) 581 hiv-positive (94.7%
receiving cart) 520 hiv-negative participants agehiv cohort study,
aged ≥45 years. used multivariable linear regression investigate
independent associations hiv, hiv disease characteristics, art, bmd.
results: study population largely consisted men sex men
(msm). osteoporosis significantly prevalent hiv infection 
(13.3% vs 6.7%; p<.001). adjustment body weight smoking, being
hiv-positive longer independently associated bmd. low body weight was
more strongly negatively associated bmd hiv-positive persons a
history centers disease control prevention class b c event.
interestingly, regardless hiv status, younger msm significantly lower bmd 
than older msm, heterosexual men, women.
conclusions: observed lower bmd treated hiv-positive individuals was
largely explained lower body weight smoking. experienced 
symptomatic hiv disease, often associated weight loss, another risk
factor. low bmd observed younger msm remains unexplained needs further
study.
