adaptive b cell response key arm protective immunity influenza
viruses. owing acutely infectious cytopathic nature viruses, 
efficient containment viral spread relies prompt provision of
protective antibodies site virus infection, respiratory tract (rt).
to accelerate protective antibody response, b cell responses be
ectopically induced, maintained, reactivated lungs primary and
secondary infection, thereby providing anatomical advantage supplying
neutralizing antibodies reinfecting viruses faster kinetics.
however, prompt supply protective antibodies may insufficient to
protect reinfection influenza viruses easily change their
antigenic profiles escape antibody surveillance. b cell responses have
multiple strategies adjusting antibody repertoires according viral
fitness, one formation local germinal centers capable of
selecting b cell repertoires antigenically subdominant, conserved,
epitopes. review, discuss several unique aspects b cell responses
that take place local sites combat acutely infectious rapidly mutating 
influenza viruses.
