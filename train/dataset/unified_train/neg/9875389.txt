the spread sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) herpesvirus infections, continued unabated despite
educational efforts spearheaded response hiv-1 epidemic. this
suggests need prophylactic measures, including application topical
antiviral agents. chemical modification bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg),
the major protein whey, hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3hp) led the
generation potent hiv-1 inhibitor (designated 3hp-beta-lg) shown also
have activity herpes simplex virus types 1 2 (hsv-1, hsv-2). this
report provides detailed results concerning anti-herpesvirus activity of
3hp-beta-lg, indicating compound: (i) inhibited infection human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv), known sexually transmitted; (ii)
inactivated infectivity hsv-1 hsv-2; (iii) inhibited cell-to-cell
transmission hsv-1 hsv-2; (iv) bound hsv-1, hsv-2 hcmv virus
particles partially inhibited binding anti-glycoprotein e (ge) and
anti-gc monoclonal antibodies hsv-1 hsv-2. binding 3hp-beta-lg to
the herpesviruses study inhibited aggregated human igg, suggesting
that respective viral fc receptor one target sites 3hp-beta-lg.
in agreement results inhibition hiv-1 infection, 3hp-beta-lg appears
to acid anhydride-modified protein choice antiviral agent against
herpesviruses.
