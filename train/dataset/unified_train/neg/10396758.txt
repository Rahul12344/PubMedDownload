an indirect sandwich elisa detect little 8 ng african
horsesickness virus (ahsv) developed. viral antigen captured from
suspension using immobilized monoclonal antibody specific epitope on
vp7, protein major constituent virus core. egg-yolk derived
chicken igy directed ahsv (serotype 3) used secondary
antibody. since igy mouse igg cross-react serologically, secondary
antibody labelled, instead detected enzyme-coupled sheep
antibodies directed avian immunoglobulins. assay recognized nine 
ahsv serotypes, cascara isolate equine encephalosis virus, a
related orbivirus also infects horses. addition able detect
and quantify whole ahsv, elisa could show presence vp7 produced by
recombinant baculoviruses.
