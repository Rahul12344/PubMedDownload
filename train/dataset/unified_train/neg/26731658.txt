the hepatitis c virus (hcv) life cycle closely associated lipid
metabolism. particular, hcv assembly initiates surface lipid
droplets. understand role lipid droplets hcv life cycle, 
assessed relationship hcv adipose differentiation-related
protein (adrp), lipid droplet-associated protein. different steps hcv life
cycle assessed hcv-infected human huh-7 hepatoma cells overexpressing
adrp upon transduction lentiviral vector. hcv infection increased adrp
mrna protein expression levels 2- 1.5-fold, respectively. the
overexpression adrp led increase (i) surface lipid droplets,
(ii) total cellular neutral lipid content (2.5- 5-fold increase of
triglycerides cholesterol esters, respectively), (iii) cellular free
cholesterol level (5-fold) (iv) hcv particle production infectivity
(by 2- 3.5-fold, respectively). investigation different steps the
hcv life cycle indicated adrp overexpression, affecting the
viral replication, promoted virion egress entry (~12-fold), latter
possibly via increase receptor occludin. moreover, hcv infection
induces increase adrp occludin expression. hcv infected cells, 
the occludin upregulation fully prevented adrp silencing, suggesting a
specific, adrp-dependent mechanism. finally, hcv-infected human livers,
occludin adrp mrna expression levels correlated other. alltogether,
these findings show hcv induces adrp, turns appears confer a
favorable environment viral spread.
