gooseberry vein banding disease (gvbd) affects ribes species cultivars
worldwide. second important virus-like disease crops
after black currant reversion disease. paper, describe bacilliform
virus, gooseberry vein banding associated virus (gvbav), associated
closely gvbd, provide evidence gvbav distinct species within
the genus badnavirus. purified gvbav particles ca. 120 Ã— 30 nm size and
contained dsdna. sequence 1.5-kb dna fragment amplified viral
genomic dna similar wide range badnaviruses contained
motifs characteristic rnase h domain badnavirus open reading frame 
(orf) iii polyprotein. phylogenetic analyses suggest gvbav closely
related spiraea yellow leaf spot virus. using sequence derived the
polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-amplified dna fragment, virus-specific primers
were designed. primers used pcr assay gvbav range of
ribes germplasm affected gvbd, unrelated virus-like diseases 
viruses found ribes, healthy plants. gvbav detected 58
gvbd-affected plants diverse sources, healthy ribes plants 
from plants infected viruses.
