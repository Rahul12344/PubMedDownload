several studies suggested association human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6)
and multiple sclerosis (ms). previously studied intrathecal production of
antibody lymphotropic herpesviruses ms patients presence human
herpesvirus 1 7 dnas cerebrospinal fluid (csf). present study
anti-hhv-6 immunoglobulin (igm) serum anti-hhv-6 igg subclasses serum
and csf examined lymphoproliferative response hhv-6 analyzed.
the pcr examination refined purifying dna csf retesting the
samples hhv-6 dna. statistically significant differences
between groups concerning igm positivity, distribution igg subclasses, 
lymphoproliferative response hhv-6. purification dna increased the
number pcr-positive samples 0 71 4 68. study give
additional support possibility hhv-6 common cause ms, a
role virus subset patients cannot excluded.
