mutations identified variants poliovirus, type 1 (mahoney) the
basis resistance neutralization individual monoclonal antibodies. 
the phenotypes variants defined terms antibody binding; the
pattern epitopes expressed able exploited neutralization were
complex. single amino acid changes distant (in terms linear sequence)
and generalized effects antigenic structure poliovirus similarly
constituted virions.
