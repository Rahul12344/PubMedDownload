rapid diagnosis respiratory syncytial virus influenza virus infections
by immunofluorescence: experience simplified procedure preparation
of cell smears nasopharyngeal secretions.

anestad g, breivik n, thoresen t.

a simplified procedure preparing direct smears exfoliated cells from
nasopharyngeal secretions presented. specimens examined the
indirect immunofluorescence (if) technique presence respiratory
syncytial (rs) virus influenza virus antigens. specimens 457 children 
hospitalised twelve different hospital departments norway examined
during winter season 1980-81. rs virus identified samples 139
children influenza virus 28. results examinations rs virus
were copositive serology 19 23 cases (83%) probably false 
positive results. samples 29 children also prepared conventional
washing technique. rs virus identified 18 specimens. seventeen of
these also found positive simplified method. comparison done
blind. compared results virus isolation serology examinations
for influenza virus somewhat less sensitive copositivity 12 17 
cases (71%) one instance finding probably false positive.
however, also influenza virus findings fully comparable with
figures obtained others performed conventional washing technique for
preparation exfoliated cells nasopharyngeal secretions. general
practitioners submitted samples 65 patients, rs virus influenza a
virus identified eleven four cases respectively. simplicity of
preparation cell smears nasopharyngeal secretions simplified
method opens possibility application rapid respiratory virus
diagnostic service increasing number hospital departments also for
general practitioners. feel method suitable tool for
surveillance certain respiratory virus infections.
