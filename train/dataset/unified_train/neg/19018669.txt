hiv-1 subtype c fastest spreading subtype worldwide predominantly uses
the ccr5 coreceptor, showing minimal transition x4 phenotype. raises 
the possibility envelope proteins hiv-1 subtype c structural
features favor interaction ccr5. preference ccr5 could arise from
enhanced affinity hiv-1 subtype c ccr5. test this, have
characterized interaction gp120 envelope proteins hiv-1 subtype c
clones cd4 ccr5. recombinant gp120 proteins isolates hiv-1
subtypes b c expressed, purified, assessed cd4 binding assay
and ccr5 chemokine competition binding assay. gp120 proteins bound to
cd4-expressing cells, except one, 97za347ts, arg substituted the
cys239 conserved c2 loop. reconstitution cys239, using site-directed
mutagenesis, restored cd4 binding, introducing arg ser position 239
of functional du151 gp120 protein abrogated cd4 binding. shows 
cys228-cys239 disulfide bond gp120 required high-affinity binding to
cd4. recombinant gp120 proteins two hiv-1 subtype b clones bound ccr5 the
presence cd4, gp120 x4-tropic, hxb2, clone bind ccr5.
gp120 two functional hiv-1 subtype c clones, du151 mole1, bound ccr5
with high affinity presence cd4 du151 showed significant ccr5
binding absence cd4. gp120 nonfunctional subtype c clone had
lower affinity ccr5. results indicate hiv-1 subtype c proteins
have high affinity ccr5 variable dependence cd4.
