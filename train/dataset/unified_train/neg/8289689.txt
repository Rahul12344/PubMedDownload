a phylogenetic tree constructed unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic means (upgma) vp8* gene 13 human two feline rotavirus
strains possessing au-1 gene 4 allele revealed strains could be
classified two clusters correspond year isolation 
or host species originated. nine 10 human strains one 
feline strain isolated japan formed one cluster, whereas three human strains
from italy one feline strain australia formed other. human strain k8
from japan distantly related australo-european clustering.
