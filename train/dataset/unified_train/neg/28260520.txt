background: consideration recent developments understanding genomics
and proteomics viruses, use viral dna / rna sequences well 
gene expression schemes, found new in-roads towards prognosis and
therapy diseases. correspondingly, sphere patenting scenario has
expanded significantly.
objectives: current review addresses patented inventions concerning use
of virus sequences gene silencing machineries inventions concerning the
generation application viral sequences expression vectors. furthermore,
this review also discusses employment patents clinical,
agricultural biotechnological applications.
method: considering objectives, delphion research intellectual property
network database searched using keywords "gene silencing",
"engineered viruses" "expression vectors" descriptions recent patents 
on said topics discussed.
conclusion: despite several recent advances use viruses disease
therapy vehicles biotechnological vectors, developments yet 
proven effective practice, clinical field trials.
