circadian variations number circulating lymphocytes their
subpopulations observed healthy subjects. cyclic changes are
characterized trough 8:00 a.m. peak midnight. using multiple
peripheral blood samplings, able confirm cycle applied to
cd4 t-cells (helpers) b-cells (cd20). cycle cd8 lymphocytes was
observed. second stage, greater comfort patient number of
samplings reduced two: one 8:00 a.m. (trough) one midnight
(peak). method enabled us calculate amplitude lymphocytes cycles
in 18 controls 74 human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) seropositive patients.
in asymptomatic hiv carriers amplitude cd4 cycles normal 6/26 cases
and b-cell cycles 2/17 cases. group asymptomatic hiv
carriers mean amplitude cycles much less reduced other
two groups. results incite us believe loss cd4 t-cell
cycles early sign hiv infection antedating decrease observed 
number cells.
