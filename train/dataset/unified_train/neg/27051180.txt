aim: avian encephalomyelitis (ae) viral disease infect various
types poultry, especially chicken. indonesia, incidence ae infection
in chicken reported since 2009, ae incidence tends increase 
year year. objective study analyze viral protein 2 (vp-2)
encoding gene ae virus (aev) various species birds field specimen
by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) amplification using
specific nucleotides primer confirmation ae diagnosis.
materials methods: total 13 aev samples isolated various
species poultry serologically diagnosed infected aev some
areas central java, indonesia. research stage consists virus samples
collection field specimens, extraction aev rna, amplification vp-2
protein encoding gene rt-pcr, separation rt-pcr product agarose gel
electrophoresis, dna sequencing data analysis.
results: amplification products vp-2 encoding gene aev rt-pcr
methods various types poultry field specimens showed positive
results sample code 499/4/12 generated dna fragment size 619
bp. sensitivity test rt-pcr amplification showed minimum
concentration rna template 127.75 ng/µl. multiple alignments dna
sequencing product indicated positive sample code 499/4/12 92%
nucleotide homology compared aev accession number av1775/07 85%
nucleotide homology accession number zchp2/0912695 genbank database.
analysis vp-2 gene sequence showed found 46 nucleotides difference
between isolate 499/4/12 compared accession number av1775/07 93
nucleotides different accession number zchp2/0912695.
conclusions: analyses vp-2 encoding gene aev rt-pcr method 13
samples field specimen generated dna fragment size 619 bp from
one sample sample code 499/4/12. sensitivity rate rt-pcr to
amplify vp-2 gene aev 127.75 ng/µl rna template. compared to
genbank databases, isolate 499/4/12 85% 92% nucleotide homology.
