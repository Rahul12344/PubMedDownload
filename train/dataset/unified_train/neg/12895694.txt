mice retrovirus-induced immunosuppression (maids) susceptible to
experimental murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) retinitis, rendered
resistant retinitis systemic interleukin-2 (il-2) immunotherapy.
experiments performed explore mechanism il-2 treatment
during maids might restore resistance mcmv retinitis. whereas 80% untreated
maids mice susceptible mcmv retinitis, none (0%) il-2-treated maids
mice developed necrotizing retinitis. comparison, 100% untreated and
il-2-treated perforin knockout mice (pko mice) susceptible mcmv
retinitis, severity retinitis amounts infectious intraocular mcmv
in il-2-treated pko mice equivalent untreated pko mice. a
competitive quantitative rt-pcr assay used measure levels perforin 
mrna within mcmv-infected eyes immunologically normal mice, untreated maids
mice, il-2-treated maids mice. although level perforin mrna within
mcmv-infected eyes untreated maids mice susceptible retinitis was
significantly reduced compared high level found within mcmv-infected 
eyes normal mice resistant retinitis, systemic treatment maids mice with
il-2 increased perforin mrna within mcmv-infected eyes levels found normal 
mice. ability il-2 treatment increase intraocular levels perforin
mrna diminished progression maids. findings support the
hypothesis systemic il-2 immunotherapy maids provides protection
against mcmv retinitis upregulation perforin-mediated cytotoxicity used 
cytotoxic lymphocytes kill virus-infected cells.
