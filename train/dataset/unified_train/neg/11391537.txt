hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections evaluated chimpanzees had
previously cleared hcv rechallenged. animals previously cleared
hcv infection rapidly cleared homologous heterologous virus upon rechallenge,
indicative strong protective immunity. one animal, sterilizing immunity
was observed regard viremia, although viral rna transiently detected 
in liver. accelerated viral clearance following rechallenge hcv was
observed animals exposed hcv 16 years,
suggesting long-lasting protective immunity may possible. ability 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) recognize hcv proteins evaluated
during course rechallenge experiments. early strong in
vitro recall response hcv nonstructural proteins appeared associated
with viral clearance. contrast, proliferative responses hcv proteins were
not observed 4 persistently infected chimpanzees, weak proliferative
response observed 1 2 animals acute resolving infection. the
results suggest strong t-cell proliferative response induced upon
rechallenge chimpanzees hcv response associated with
rapid viral clearance. antibody response hcv proteins increased over
1,000-fold animals following rechallenge well. complete
understanding role cellular immune response clearance hcv
and nature protective immune response following viral clearance may
aid generation therapies vaccines.
