recent reports isolation type c viruses human cells generated
considerable controversy close relationship viruses 
type c viruses subhuman primates. findings interpreted as
evidence contamination despite repeated isolation type c viruses 
from separate clinical specimens separate frozen primary cell stocks of
the donor. laboratory described type c virus released
from hel-12 strain normal human embryonic lung fibroblasts. hel-12
virus related immunologically simian sarcoma (woolly monkey fibrosarcoma)
virus (sisv) endogenous type c viruses baboons domestic cats. to
demonstrate hel-12 virus adventitious contaminant, fresh human
tissues examined antigenic cross-reactivity hel-12 virus antigens. 
some patients myelogenous leukemia contain circulating immunoglobulins which
specifically inhibit reverse transcriptases hel-12 virus primate type 
c viruses. addition, glomerular immune complexes patients systemic
lupus erythematosus contain antigens related hel-12 virus proteins. using 
techniques molecular hybridisation, demonstrate hel-12 cells
contain proviral dna sequences antigen expression spontaneous virus
release detected. also present evidence existence nucleic
acid sequences homologous hel-12 viral rna dnas certain cancer
patients.
