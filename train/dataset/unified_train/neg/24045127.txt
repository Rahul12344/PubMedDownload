the adult american lobster (homarus americanus) susceptible naturally
occurring pathogens, viral pathogen known exist. despite this,
relatively little known h. americanus immune system nothing is
known potential viral immune response. hundreds rural communities in
atlantic canada rely lobster fishery economic sustainability and
could devastated large-scale pathogen-mediated mortality events. white 
spot syndrome virus economically devastating viral pathogen global
shrimp aquaculture production proposed capable infecting
all decapod crustaceans including european lobster. vivo wssv injection
challenge conducted h. americanus wssv found capable of
infecting replicating within lobsters held 20°c. vivo wssv
challenge also generated first viral disease model h. americanus and
allowed high-throughput examination transcriptomic changes occur 
during viral infection. microarray analysis found 136 differentially expressed
genes expression subset genes verified using rt-qpcr.
anti-lipopolysaccharide isoforms acute phase serum amyloid protein a
expression change wssv infection, contrary previous findings
during bacterial parasitic infection h. americanus. this, along the
differential gene expression thioredoxin trypsin isoforms, provides
compelling evidence h. americanus capable mounting immune response
