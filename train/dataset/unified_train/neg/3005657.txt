short repeats cause heterogeneity genomic terminus bovine herpesvirus 1.

hammerschmidt w, ludwig h, buhk hj.

analysis genomes different bovine herpesvirus 1 strains revealed ul
terminal hindiii fragment differing size (from 2.4 2.8 kilobases). this
fragment polymorphism occurred dna wild-type isolate, highly
passaged, apathogenic tissue culture derivatives, plaque-purified
substrains. heterogeneity due variations copy number a
14-base-pair tandem repeat comprising base sequence 5'-gctcctcctccctc-3',
which also exists, differences, short reiteration sequences of
herpes simplex virus type 1, epstein-barr virus, related human cellular dna. 
furthermore, tandem repeat array located close proximity left
end viral genome may functionally involved viral replication.
