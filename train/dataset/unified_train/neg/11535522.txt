it thought human t-cell lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i) preferentially
infects cd4(+) cells vivo. however, observations high htlv-i proviral
load patients htlv-i-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis
suggest htlv-i may infect cell types addition cd4(+) cells. to
identify vivo t-cell tropisms htlv-i, real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (pcr) intracellular protein staining used. high amount 
of htlv-i proviral dna detected purified cd8(+) cells quantitative 
pcr (between 1.64 62.83 copies htlv-i provirus per 100 isolated cd8(+) t
cells). cd8(+) cells expressed htlv-i-related antigens (htlv-i tax p19
protein) short time cultivation. results demonstrate cd8(+)
t cells also infected htlv-i express htlv-i antigens levels 
are comparable htlv-i-infected cd4(+) cells. therefore, cd8(+) cells an
additional viral reservoir vivo htlv-i may contribute the
pathogenesis htlv-i-mediated disorders.
