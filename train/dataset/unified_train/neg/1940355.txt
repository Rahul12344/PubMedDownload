cells monocyte lineage act major reservoir hiv, ways of
enhancing resistance mononuclear phagocytes hiv replication would be
useful delaying onset aids infected individuals. seif et al. (j.
virol. 65:664, 1991) recently shown possibility obtaining stable
antiviral expression (save), directed three nonretroviral rna viruses,
and normal cell viability significant percentage murine balb/c 3t3 cells 
transformed ifn-beta expression plasmid control 0.6-kb
xhoii-nrui promoter region murine h-2kb mhc gene. present paper, we
show possible establish save human promonocytic cells. cells 
the human promonocytic u937 line stably transfected human ifn-beta
expression plasmid carrying neo- human ifn-beta-coding sequences under
the control h-2kb promoter fragment previously used murine cells. after
selection g418, two transformed clones isolated released small
amounts human ifn-beta culture medium, without affecting the
expression cd4 leucocyte function-associated ag-1 differentiation ag. 
presence construct-derived ifn-beta mrna demonstrated polymerase chain 
reaction amplification cdna, level 2-5a synthetase, one the
major ifn-induced antiviral proteins, shown constitutively increased.
these clones less permissive hiv-1 control clones transformed 
the neo gene only. antiviral state could modulated anti-ifn-beta
antibodies, continuous presence antibodies culture medium
abolished enhanced resistance hiv-1 replication, whereas withdrawal of
the antiserum restored antiviral state, indicating indeed result 
from constitutive synthesis human ifn-beta. results demonstrate 
possibility restricting hiv-1 replication human promonocytic cells by
establishing save. exploration method possible approach to
somatic cell gene therapy hiv infection appears worthwhile.
