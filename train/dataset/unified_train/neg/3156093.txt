staphylococcus aureus patients toxic shock syndrome (tss) produce tss
toxin 1. transferred, bacteriophage, ability produce tss toxin 1
from tss toxin 1-positive tss toxin 1-negative strain s. aureus. this
recombinant strain produced tss toxin 1 confirmed isoelectric focusing,
immunodiffusion, radioimmunoassay, autoradiography. recombinant produced 
tss-like illness rabbits, significantly (p less 0.001) more
lethal recipient strain. strains produced fever diarrhea, but, 
in addition, rabbits challenged recombinant also developed lowered blood
pressure (p = 0.002), conjunctival hyperemia, erythroderma, respiratory
distress. histopathological findings rabbits challenged recombinant
strain remarkably similar described humans tss, e.g.,
erythrophagocytosis, liver "triaditis," vasodilatation. study
demonstrates protein may contribute pathogenesis tss.
