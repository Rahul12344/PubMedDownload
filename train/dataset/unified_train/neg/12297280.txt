foot-and-mouth disease virus leader proteinase (l(pro)), papain-like cysteine
proteinase, six acidic amino acids 4 11 catalytic dyad
of cys51 his148. contrast, papain related enzymes, one acidic 
residue lies within distance. examined site-directed mutagenesis 
the importance residues l(pro) self-processing cleavage 
of cellular substrate, eukaryotic initiation factor 4gi. substitution of
the electrostatic charge aspartate 164 affected enzyme activity. thus, in
contrast prototype papain, l(pro) activity requires negative charge 4.5 
a catalytic dyad.
