plants often simultaneously exposed diverse environmental stresses, and
can tune suitable responses hormones. salicylic acid (sa) and
jasmonic acid (ja) signaling pathways known enhance resistance against
heat stress tomato yellow leaf curl thailand virus (tylcthv) infection.
however, limited information regarding alternative natural priming
agents heat stress viruses. study, two plant-derived priming 
agents, eugenol anise oil, tested roles conferring
thermotolerance virus resistance tomato plants. heat stress, the
survival rates average fresh weight higher plants treated with
eugenol anise oil control plants. two priming agents were
further tested antiviral activities. tylcthv infection, disease
incidence relative abundance tylcthv lower anise oil- and
eugenol-treated plants control plants. analyses revealed a
few sa, ja, rna silencing genes enhanced former. moreover, sa,
ja, h2o2 contents increased considerably eugenol anise oil
treatments. findings imply anise oil eugenol initiated sa- and
ja-mediated defenses promote thermotolerance antiviral responses tomato
plants.
