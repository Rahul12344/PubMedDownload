the majority studies hiv-1 drug resistance involved subtype b viruses.
here characterized subtype distribution determined levels of
polymorphism protease (pr) reverse transcriptase (rt) drug resistance
positions, antiretroviral treatment-naive hiv-positive ugandan patients. we
have also investigated codon usage variability positions assessed
intersubtype recombination within pol gene. study population consisted of
187 patients, cohort established uk medical research council
programme aids uganda 1990. results indicate 28.3% patients were
infected subtype (n = 53), 64.2% subtype (n = 120), 6.4% a/d recombinant
(n = 12), 1.1% subtype c (n = 2). variation amino acid usage drug
resistance-associated positions minimal two main subtypes (a 
d) rt, appreciable variation pr. codon usage, however, was
considerably variable subtypes pr rt. thus,
while natural high-level resistance antiretroviral therapy detected 
this cohort, subtypes may possess different genetic barriers be
overcome order achieve resistance. increasing introduction of
antiretroviral therapy africa, information vital our
understanding evaluation development drug resistance occurs, 
and interpret resistance data type rarely previously been
seen. analysis also significantly increases number ugandan pr rt
