objective: investigate mechanism gp96 raised hepatitis b virus
(hbv) infection pathological mechanism.
methods: mechanism nf-kb activating gp96 expression determined by
bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, real-time pcr western
blot. effect over-expression knockdown gp96 expression transfection
or rna interference hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis cell cycle was
examined cck-8 flow cytometry. role gp96 hcc development was
determined epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emt) colony formation assay.
results: nf-kb significantly increased gp96 expression binding the
nf-kappab binding site. over-expression knockdown studies show gp96
promoted hepatocyte proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, induced g0/g1 s
phase cell cycle progression. moreover, gp96 induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition increased colony formation ability hepatocytes.
conclusion: results therefore provide insights chronic hbv
infection-induced gp96 expression, indicate elevated gp96 may contribute
to hcc development chronic inflammation.
