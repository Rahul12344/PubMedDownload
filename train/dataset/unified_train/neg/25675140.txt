the purpose study evaluate pathologically reproductive system
of nonvaccinated porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus
(prrsv)-vaccinated sows/gilts, well assessment vaccination impact on
their endometrium/myometrium ovaries. farrow-to-finish farm, sows
and gilts systematically vaccinated prrsv-inactivated vaccine a
period 18 months. last semester beginning trial, 
the genital organs (uterus ovaries) 50 females (nonvaccinated
primiparous multiparous sows exhibit signs estrus 10
days post-weaning) collected slaughterhouse gross microscopic
examination (parity 1 >6). respectively, following three semesters 
after implementation experimental prrsv vaccination scheme, the
genital organs 75 vaccinated sows-25 samples taken along period 
semester-were also collected. gross examinations included measurements uterine
horn (thickness diameter) ovaries (diameter). microscopic examination
focused histopathological examination ovarian cysts cystic
formations evaluation endometrium myometrium. measurements of
uterine horn's thickness/diameter ovaries' diameter normal levels,
and significant differences found gross examination vaccinated
and nonvaccinated females. results histopathological examinations 
show lesions endometritis myometritis, revealed ovarian cystic
formations diameter >2â€‰cm luteinizing cysts. presence 
these luteinizing cysts significantly lower prrsv-vaccinated animals,
compared nonvaccinated, three semesters (p=0.017) start of
vaccinations total trial period (p=0.009).
