the mating efficiencies (the percentage females inseminated males) of
field-collected laboratory-colonized aedes triseriatus (say) (diptera:
culicidae) female mosquitoes transovarially infected uninfected la crosse
virus (lacv) compared. females placed cages age-matched
males, insemination rates (number inseminated females total
number females examined) determined daily detection sperm the
spermathecae. lacv-infected mosquitoes typically mated earlier uninfected
mosquitoes, i.e., insemination occurred earlier mixing males and
females. lacv load correlated increased insemination.
