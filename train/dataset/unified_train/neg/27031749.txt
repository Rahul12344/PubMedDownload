many viruses contain rna elements modulate splicing and/or promote nuclear
export rnas. rnas major human pathogen, hepatitis b virus
(hbv) contain large (~600 bases) composite cis-acting 'post-transcriptional
regulatory element' (pre). element promotes expression naturally 
intronless transcripts. indeed, related woodchuck hepadnavirus pre (wpre) 
used enhance expression gene therapy expression vectors. these
pre likely act combination mechanisms, including promotion of
rna nuclear export. functional components hbv pre wpre 2
conserved rna cis-acting stem-loop (sl) structures, slα slβ. within 
the coding regions polymerase (p) gene, p x genes, respectively. 
based previous studies using mutagenesis and/or nuclear magnetic resonance
(nmr), propose 2 covariance models slα slβ. model the
30-nucleotide slα contains g-bulge cngg(u) apical loop first
and fourth loop residues form cg pair fifth loop residue bulged 
out, observed nmr structure. model 23-nucleotide slβ
contains 7-base-pair stem 9-nucleotide loop. comparison models
with rna structural elements, well similarity searches human
transcriptome viral genomes demonstrate slα slβ specific hbv 
transcripts. however, well conserved among hepadnaviruses of
non-human primates, woodchuck ground squirrel.
