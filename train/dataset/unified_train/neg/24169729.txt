post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (ptld) well-recognized
aggressive disease commonly associated epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection
after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (hsct). although rituximab (rtx) is
incorporated first-line therapy ebv-ptld patients, outcome of
the clinically overt disease still optimal mainly due regrowth of
tumor cells. proliferation cd20-/cd19+ tumor cells increasingly
reported rtx-treated ebv-ptld patients, whereas emergence cd20-/cd19-
tumor cells barely recognized. here, report fatal case 18-year-old 
patient developed ebv-ptld allogeneic hsct anaplastic large-cell
lymphoma. day 60 hsct, patient developed abdominal pain, watery
diarrhea, low-grade fever. colon biopsy revealed proliferation of
cd20+/cd19+/ebv-encoded rna (eber)+ tumor cells, increase ebv dna was
detected peripheral blood (pb). treated rtx ebv-ptld was
cleared ebv dna pb. however, manifested high-grade fever, pancytopenia, 
and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor prominent hemophagocytosis 
bone marrow aspirates treated etoposide hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (hlh) complication. developed ebv dna positivity in
pb finally died bacteroides fragilis sepsis subsequent bloody stool and
ileus day 163. autopsy revealed erosion bleeding whole colon with
the proliferation cd20-/cd19-/eber+ tumor cells. immunohistochemical analysis 
uncovered cd3-/cd56-/cd79a+/cd79b+ b-cell origin tumor cells. case
clinically demonstrates removal cd20 cd19 antigens eber+ b
cells rtx-treated ebv-ptld patient hlh complication.
