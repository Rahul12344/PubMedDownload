objective: identify patient-care practices related increased prevalence 
of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection among chronic hemodialysis patients.
design: survey.
setting: chronic hemodialysis facilities united states.
participants: equal-probability 2-stage cluster sampling used select 87
facilities medicare-approved providers treating 30-150 patients; 53
facilities 2,933 3,680 eligible patients agreed participate.
methods: patients tested hcv antibody hcv rna. data patient-care 
practices collected using direct observation.
results: overall prevalence hcv infection 9.9% (95% confidence
interval [ci], 8.2%-11.6%); 2 294 hcv-positive patients detected
solely hcv rna testing. adjusting non-dialysis-related hcv risk
factors, patient-care practices independently associated higher prevalence
of hcv infection included reusing priming receptacles without disinfection (odds 
ratio [or], 2.3 [95% ci, 1.4-3.9]), handling blood specimens adjacent to
medications clean supplies (or, 2.2 [95% ci, 1.3-3.6]), using mobile
carts deliver injectable medications (or, 1.7 [95% ci, 1.0-2.8]).
independently related facility covariates least 10% patient hcv infection
prevalence (or, 3.0 [95% ci, 1.8-5.2]), patient-to-staff ratio least 7 : 1 
(or, 2.4 [95% ci, 1.4-4.1]), treatment duration least 2 years (or, 2.4 
[95% ci, 1.3-4.4]).
conclusions: study provides first epidemiologic evidence associations
between specific patient-care practices higher hcv infection prevalence among
hemodialysis patients. staff review practices ensure that
hemodialysis-specific infection control practices implemented,
especially handling clean contaminated items separate areas, reusing items
only disinfected, prohibiting mobile medication clean supply carts
within treatment areas.
