priming naive cd8+ cd4+ cells dendritic cells (dcs) requires
effective antigen presentation mhc class ii molecules. have
developed novel technology use recombinant overlapping peptides (rop) that
stimulate cd8+ cd4+ cell immune responses. single chain protein of
a rop made overlapping peptides linked target sequence (lrmk) for
cathepsin s, protease found endosomes dcs. designed synthetic
genes encoding rops derived ovalbumin (ova), tuberculosis protein
(cfp10-esat6), human papilloma virus (hpv) protein (e7) survivin, protein
commonly over-expressed tumour cells. epitope rop-ova was
cross-presented detected cd8+ cell receptor-like antibody (tcr like
ab). human dcs pulsed rop-survivin activated cd8+ cells. cd4-low pbmcs
from hiv tb co-infected patients recognized rop-cfp10-esat6 compared a
soluble form antigen. immunization mice rop-survivin rop-hpv-e7
generated specific cellular immune responses protected mice inoculation 
with melanoma b16 cells expressing survivin hpv-e7 proteins. together these
data provide evidence support rop central component new platform for
therapeutic vaccines diagnostics.
