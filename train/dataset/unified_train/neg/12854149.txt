aim: analyze molecular evolution different viral genomic regions hcv
in acute hcv infected patient chronically infected hiv 42-month
follow-up.
methods: serum samples chronically hiv infected patient seroconverted
to anti hcv antibodies sequenced, event superinfection a
period 17 months late sample (42nd month). hypervariable genomic
regions hiv (v3 loop gp120) hcv (hvr-1 e2 glycoprotein gene)
were studied. order analyze genomic regions involved different
biological functions cellular immune response, hcv core ns5a
were also chosen sequenced. amplification different regions done
by rt-pcr directly sequenced. confirmation sequences done on
reamplified material. nucleotide sequences different time points were
aligned clustal w 1.5, corresponding amino acid ones deduced.
results: hypervariable genomic regions viruses (hvr1 gp120 v3 loop)
presented several nonsynonymous changes but, gp120 v3 loop mutations
were detected sample obtained right hcv superinfection and
maintained throughout, occurred following sequential cumulative
pattern hvr1. ns5a region hcv, two amino acid changes were
detected follow-up period, whereas core region presented several
amino acid replacements, hcv chronic infection established.
conclusion: hiv-hcv superinfection, genomic region analyzed shows
a different evolutionary pattern. nucleotide substitutions observed
are non-synonymous clustered previously described epitopes, thus
suggesting immune-driven evolutionary process.
