giant viruses contain large genomes, encode many proteins atypical viruses,
replicate large viral factories, tend infect protists. giant virus 
replication factories turn infected called virophages, 
smaller viruses negatively impact giant virus replication. example is
mimiviruses infect protist acanthamoeba infected
by virophage sputnik. study examines evolutionary dynamics this
system, using mathematical models. models suggest virophage
population evolve increasing degrees giant virus inhibition, it
further suggests renders virophage population prone extinction
due dynamic instabilities wide parameter ranges. implications and
conditions required avoid extinction discussed. another interesting result
is virophage presence fundamentally alter evolutionary course the
giant virus. giant virus predicted evolve toward increasing its
basic reproductive ratio absence virophage, opposite true in
its presence. therefore, virophages benefit host population
directly inhibiting giant viruses also indirectly causing giant
viruses evolve toward weaker phenotypes. experimental tests model are
suggested.
