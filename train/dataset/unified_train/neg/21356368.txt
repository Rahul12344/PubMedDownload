γδ cells subset cells associated epithelial mucosal tissues and
play prominent role promoting dampening inflammatory responses to
pathogens; addition, strongly mediate epithelial repair. using a
bleomycin model pulmonary fibrosis, found γδ t-cell populations
dramatically increased bleomycin administration. determine the
importance cells, exposed mice lacking δ chain γδ t-cell
receptor (γδ knockout [ko]) bleomycin. pulmonary fibrosis severe in
γδ ko mice, measured collagen deposition (hydroxyproline) and
histopathological features. furthermore, evidence resolution of
the fibrotic response 45 days bleomycin therapy. contrast to
control mice, γδ ko mice decreased concentrations il-6, granulocyte colony
stimulating factor, chemokine cxc ligand (cxcl) 1, interferon inducible
protein 10/cxcl10. vitro culture γδ cells purified lungs 17 days
after bleomycin exposure (a time peak influx cells) demonstrated that
γδ cells produced substantial quantities four cytokines,
suggesting γδ cells predominant source proteins. to
demonstrate γδ cells effector cells fibrotic response, we
performed adoptive transfer experiments γδ cells sorted from
bleomycin-treated lungs; cells sufficient resolve fibrosis γδ ko
mice restore cxcl10 levels comparable wild-type mice. furthermore,
overexpression cxcl10 lung decreased severity fibrosis seen in
the γδ ko mice. finally, adoptive transfer γδ cells cxcl10(-/-) mice
failed reverse severe fibrosis γδ ko mice. results indicate 
γδ cells promote resolution fibrosis production cxcl10.
