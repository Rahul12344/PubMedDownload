immunization studies hsv-1 hsv-2 envelope proteins expressed in
escherichia coli performed. active immunization mice gd-1
antigen (leu53-ala312) expressed fusion protein, animals protected 
from lethal challenge hsv-1 hsv-2. addition, antisera rabbits 
immunized gd-1 antigen also conferred passive immunity mice
against challenge infection either hsv-1 hsv-2. contrast these
successful gd-1 protection experiments, various gc-1 gc-2 fusion proteins
from e. coli failed induce protective immunity. moreover, mice sera from
immunized animals able react authentic, glycosylated gc-1
and gc-2 envelope proteins, whereas sera raised authentic gc-1 gc-2
glycoproteins recognize gc fusion proteins e. coli. results
indicate, e. coli might represent ideal system expressing gd antigens
as possible component hsv vaccine, whereas gc antigen cannot produced
in immunocompetent form e. coli.
