glucocorticoid hormones stimulate transcription mouse mammary tumor virus 
(mmtv) promoter means interaction hormone receptor set 
upstream dna-binding sites called hormone-responsive element (hre). an
attempt understand underlying molecular mechanism, analyzed the
influence receptor binding topological state plasmids carrying
different parts hre. incubation negatively supercoiled plasmids
containing intact hre 94-kd purified glucocorticoid receptor,
followed extensive digestion topoisomerase i, leads distribution 
topoisomers shifted two turns toward positively supercoiled circles. if
relaxed plasmids incubated receptor treated topoisomerase i,
the average linking number resulting distribution topoisomers also
increased two respect controls. effect depends the
presence intact hre almost undetectable 40-kd form the
receptor. thus, binding hormone receptor functional dna regulatory
sites located closed circular plasmids results topological change that
could related hormonal activation transcription.
