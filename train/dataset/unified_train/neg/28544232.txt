problem: chronic hepatitis b (chb) carriers, alanine transaminase (alt) flares
are common peripartum period. limited data immunological
changes pregnancy chb. hypothesize pregnant chb carriers, the
th1/th2 cytokine ratio altered resulting changes biochemical/virological
and liver fibrosis markers.
study methods: serum 38 pregnant/post-partum chb carriers (median age
32 years, 53% asian, 8 hbeag+ ) tested hbv dna, quantitative hbv surface 
antigen, alt liver fibrosis transient elastography (te). serum cytokines
were analyzed using luminex assay.
results: untreated chb cases mild alt flares post-partum, showed normal
te, change viral markers despite increased th1 cytokines compared to
healthy controls (p<.05).
conclusion: chb carriers show increased th1 cytokines peripartum period
albeit effect viral load liver disease suggesting aborted
antiviral immune response.
