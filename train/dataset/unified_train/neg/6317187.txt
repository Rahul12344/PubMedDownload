three different fibronectin mrnas arise alternative splicing within coding
region.

schwarzbauer je, tamkun jw, lemischka ir, hynes ro.

we report isolation cdna clones fibronectin rat liver library
prepared expression vector, lambda gt11. restriction mapping dna
sequencing clones establish sequence c-terminal 35% rat
fibronectin, covering cell-, heparin-, fibrin-binding domains. cell- 
and heparin-binding regions homologous repeating sequences. based the
sequence data s1 nuclease mapping, conclude least three 
different fibronectin mrnas rat liver differ coding potential. the
three rnas appear arise alternative splicing within coding region and
are probably encoded single gene. implications results 
the structure function fibronectin differences various
types fibronectin discussed.
