recurrent aphthous ulceration (rau) common oral mucosal disease. 
etiology unresolved several studies suggested systemic
immunoregulatory imbalance patients. purpose present study 
to assess possible signs immunologic deficiency activation peripheral
blood mononuclear cells patients rau flow cytometry using three-color 
immunofluorescent staining previously employed patient
category. population consisted 13 14 otherwise healthy patients with
active inactive rau, respectively, 18 healthy volunteers negative 
rau history served controls. striking observation increased
fraction t-cell receptor (tcr)-gamma delta+ cells patients active rau 
(median percentage 8.5) compared controls (median percentage 2.8; p < 0.001)
and patients inactive rau (median percentage 5.0; p < 0.01). fraction of
peripheral tcr-gamma delta cells previously determined patients
with rau increased figures active disease might reflect an
immunologic stimulation exacerbation. nature stimulus remains
to established, recent studies suggest varicella zoster virus and/or 
cytomegalovirus may involved. potential role tcr-gamma delta cells in
rau lesions yet investigated appears obvious issue 
future studies.
