autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (acmnpv) belonging the
group nucleopolyhedroviruses (npvs) expressing envelope-fusion
glycoprotein gp64 transduces variety mammalian cells express foreign
genes control mammalian promoters. contrast, group ii
helicoverpa armigera single npv (hasnpv) encoding different envelope protein,
the f protein, shows detectable infectivity towards mammalian cells. this
limitation overcome expressing acmnpv gp64 hasnpv. although the
transduction ratios lower overall, range mammalian cell types
transduced hasnpv consistent transduced acmnpv. these
findings indicate f protein functions insect cells, whereas 
gp64 protein works insect mammalian cells.
