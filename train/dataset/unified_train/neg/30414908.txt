herpes simplex virus (hsv) infections cause considerable morbidity.
currently, nucleoside analogues acyclovir widely used treatment. 
however, hsv infections resistant drugs clinical problem among
immunocompromised patients. provide efficient therapy counteract
resistance, different class antiviral compounds developed.
pritelivir, helicase primase inhibitor, represents promising candidate for
improved therapy. here, established hsv-1 infection model on
microneedle-pretreated human skin ex vivo. identified hsv-1-specific
histological changes (e.g., cytopathic effects, multinucleated giant cells),
down-regulation nectin-1, nuclear translocation nf-κb (p65), interferon
regulatory factor 3 (irf3), signaling ifn-inducible protein mxa.
accordingly, model used test potency pritelivir compared 
the standard drug acyclovir. discovered drugs comparable
efficacy inhibiting hsv-1 replication, suggesting pritelivir could an
alternative therapeutic agent patients infected acyclovir-resistant
strains. knowledge, present previously unreported ex vivo hsv-1
infection model abdominal human skin test antiviral drugs, thus bridging 
the gap in vitro in vivo drug screening providing valuable
preclinical platform hsv research.
