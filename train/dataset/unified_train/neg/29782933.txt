rotavirus (rva) exhibits wide genotype diversity globally. little known
about genetic composition genotype p[6] africa. study
investigated possible evolutionary mechanisms leading genetic diversity of
genotype p[6] vp4 sequences. phylogenetic analyses 167 p[6] vp4 full-length
sequences conducted, included six porcine-origin sequences. 167
sequences, 57 newly acquired whole genome sequencing part this
study. 110 sequences publicly-available global p[6] vp4
full-length sequences downloaded genbank. strength association
between phenotypic features phylogeny also determined. number
of reassortment mixed infections rva genotype p[6] strains observed
in study. phylogenetic analyses demostrated extensive genetic diversity 
that exists among human p[6] strains, porcine-like strains, concomitant
clades/subclades estimated p[6] vp4 gene higher substitution rate 
with mean 1.05e-3 substitutions/site/year. further, phylogenetic
analyses indicated genotype p[6] strains endemic africa,
characterised extensive genetic diversity long-time local evolution 
the viruses. also supported phylogeographic clustering g-genotype
clustering p[6] strains bayesian tip-association significance testing
(bats) applied, clearly supporting viruses evolved locally africa
instead spatial mixing among different regions. overall, results
demonstrated multiple mechanisms reassortment events, various
mutations possibly interspecies transmission account enormous
diversity genotype p[6] strains africa. findings highlight need
for continued global surveillance rotavirus diversity.
