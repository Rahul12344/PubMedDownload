the 3'-terminal regions genomes vesicular stomatitis virus obtained
from two long-term, independently initiated persistent infections l cells were
found contain several sequence mutations. contrast hypermutability
displayed 5'-terminal regions genomes viruses obtained from
persistent infections baby hamster kidney (bhk) cells (p. j. o'hara, f. m.
horodyski, s. t. nichol, j. j. holland, j. virol. 49, 793-798, 1984), 5'
mutations detected viruses l-cell carrier lines. absence of
detectable defective interfering (di) particles l-cell carrier cultures
may account difference. plus-strand leader rna made viruses 
persistently infected l cells failed accumulate 5 8 hr postinfection
unlike accumulation noted leader rna generated wild-type vsv.
minus-strand leader rna, hand, accumulated similar increased
rate compared wild type. relationship observations the
processes host shutoff, viral transcription, replication discussed.
