the haematology analyser coulter gen.s gives set data -'positional
parameters'- defining white blood cell (wbc) populations mean index values 
(mean standard deviation volume, conductivity scatter, used to
identify wbc populations). volume conductivity parameters related 
the lymphocytes analysed diagnosis patients suffering chronic
b-lymphocytic leukaemia (b-cll), non-cll lymphoproliferative disorders
(olpd) viral diseases. standard deviation volume index (sdvi) is
significantly higher three groups, whereas mean volume index (mvi) 
significantly lower b-cll, increased olpd viral diseases. two
groups could distinguished mean conductivity index (mci), is
significantly lower viral disease group. cut-offs calculated each
parameter mean receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis. the
study detection performances showed combination lymphocyte
count sdvi, mvi mci could used good sensitivity and
specificity discriminate frequent lymphocyte pathologies,
even patients normal lymphocyte count.
