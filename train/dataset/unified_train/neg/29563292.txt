there increasing interest recently developing intranasal vaccines against
respiratory tract infections. antibody response critical for
vaccine-induced protection, follicular helper cells (tfh) considered
important mediating antibody response. data supporting role 
tfh antibody response animal studies, direct evidence from
humans limited, apart presence tfh-like cells blood. studied
the activation induction tfh role anti-influenza antibody
response induced live-attenuated influenza vaccine (laiv) human
nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue (nalt). tfh activation adenotonsillar
tissues analyzed flow cytometry, anti-hemagglutinin (anti-ha)
antibodies examined following laiv stimulation tonsillar mononuclear
cells (mnc). induction antigen-specific tfh laiv studied flow
cytometry analysis induced tfh cd154 expression. laiv induced tfh
proliferation, correlated anti-ha antibody production, tfh were
shown critical antibody response. induction tfh naive t
cells laiv shown newly induced tfh expressing bcl6 cd21, followed
by detection anti-ha antibodies. antigen specificity laiv-induced tfh
was demonstrated expression antigen-specific cell activation marker
cd154 upon challenge h1n1 virus antigen ha. laiv-induced tfh
differentiation inhibited bcl6, interleukin-21 (il-21), icos, cd40
signaling blocking, diminished anti-ha antibody production. in
conclusion, demonstrated induction laiv antigen-specific tfh in
human nalt provide critical support anti-influenza antibody
response. promoting antigen-specific tfh nalt use intranasal vaccines
may provide effective vaccination strategy respiratory infections in
humans.importance airway infections, influenza, common humans.
intranasal vaccination considered biologically relevant effective 
way immunization airway infection. vaccine-induced antibody
response crucial protection infection. recent data animal
studies suggest one type cells, tfh, important antibody
response. however, data whether tfh-mediated help antibody production
operates humans limited due lack access human immune tissue
containing tfh study, demonstrate induction tfh human immune
tissue, providing critical support anti-influenza antibody response, by
use intranasal influenza vaccine. findings provide direct evidence that
tfh play critical role vaccine-induced immunity humans suggest a
novel strategy promoting cells use intranasal vaccines against
respiratory infections.
