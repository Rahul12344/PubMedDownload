the aminoglycoside hygromycin b inhibits infection mouse hepatitis virus
(mhv) a59 vitro vivo. probing mechanism hygromycin
b exerts antiviral effect, describe studies point inhibition
of viral rna synthesis key step virus replication affected 
the drug. cells infected mhv take higher levels of
hygromycin b uninfected ones. comparative assays mhv replication and
mhv protein synthesis presence hygromycin b another aminoglycoside,
neomycin, indicate hygromycin b more-effective antiviral agent and
that antiviral activity likely involve phosphoinositide-mediated
processes inhibited neomycin.
