blood flukes schistosomes causative agents human schistosomiasis,
one major neglected tropical diseases. draft genome sequences been
reported schistosomes, functional genomics tools needed to
investigate role essentiality newly reported genes. vector based
rna interference contribute functional genomics analysis schistosomes.
using mrna encoding reporter firefly luciferase model target, compared
the performance schistosome human promoter u6 gene driving
shrna human fibrosarcoma cells cultured schistosomes. further, a
retroviral [murine leukemia virus (mlv)] plasmid (piggybac, pxl-bac ii)
vector utilized. schistosome u6 gene promoter 270 bp length, 
human u6 gene promoter 264 bp; shared 41% identity. following
transduction ht1080 fibrosarcoma cells schistosomules schistosoma 
mansoni pseudotyped mlv virions, stronger knockdown luciferase activity
was seen virions encoding human u6 promoter driven shrna the
schistosome u6 promoter. similar trend seen transfection ht1080
cells schistosomules pxl-bac-ii constructs-stronger knockdown of
luciferase activity seen constructs encoding human compared to
schistosome u6 promoter. findings indicate human u6 gene promoter
drives stronger shrna activity schistosome orthologue, a
human cancer cell line also larval schistosomes. rna polymerase iii
promoter represents potentially valuable component vector based rna
interference studies schistosomes related platyhelminth parasites.
