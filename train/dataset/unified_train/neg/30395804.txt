hepatitis virus cellular receptor2 (havcr2) also named t-cell immunoglobulin
and mucin domain containing-3 (tim-3) initially described helper
1-specific cell surface protein, member tim family implicated the
regulating process adaptive innate immune responses. here, medaka (oryzias
latipes) havcr2 (olhavcr2) isolated characterized. unlike havcr2
proteins, olhavcr2 possesses two ig-like domains lacks cytoplasmic and
transmembrane domains. rt-pcr results revealed olhavcr2 mrna expressed
strongly liver, moderately intestine, heart ovary, weakly
in muscle, gill, brain, eye, spleen, testis. olhavcr2 expression begun
from gastrula stage maintained hatching. signal olhavcr2 was
mainly identified blood system yolk sac situ hybridization.
these results indicated olhavcr2 expressed ubiquitously adult tissues,
and zygotic gene expressed gastrula onwards embryogenesis. olhavcr2 
may play significant role blood system medaka. immune organs, 
olhavcr2 expression affected immune stimulants, lipopolysaccharide and
poly i:c, suggesting olhavcr2 involved innate immunity adaptive
immunity medaka.
