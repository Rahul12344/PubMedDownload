a strong epithelial specific enhancer drives transcription human
papillomavirus type 18 (hpv18) oncogenes. activity depends formation
of higher-order nucleoprotein complex (enhanceosome) involving the
sequence-specific junb/fra2 transcription factor hmg-i(y) architectural
protein. show proteins hela cell nuclear extract cover almost
all hpv18 enhancer sequences contains seven binding sites 
the purified hmg-i(y) protein, providing evidence tight nucleoprotein
structure. binding hmg-i(y) ap1 heterodimer hela nuclear extract 
to overlapping sites core enhanceosome cooperative. integrity of
this specific hmg-i(y) binding site essential ap1 binding site for
the enhancer function, indicating fundamental role played this
architectural protein. demonstrate cbp/p300 coactivator recruited 
by hpv18 enhanceosome limiting transcriptional activation,
since sequestered adenovirus e1a protein junb/fra2
positive factor excess. show involvement junb p300 vivo in
the hpv18 transcription chromatin immunoprecipitation hpv18 sequences in
hela cells.
