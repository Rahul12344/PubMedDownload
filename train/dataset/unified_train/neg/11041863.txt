recent studies identified amino acid side chains forming several hydrogen
bonds dna minor groove potentially important polymerase replication 
of dna. studies probed interactions dna itself. using
non-hydrogen-bonding nucleoside isosteres, studied effects both
primer template strands several polymerases investigate general
importance interactions. six polymerases show differences the
h-bonding effects minor groove. two broad classes activity seen,
with first group dna polymerases (kf(-), taq, hiv-rt) efficiently
extends nonpolar base pairs containing nucleoside q
(9-methyl-1h-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) analogue z
(4-methylbenzimidazole), implicating specific minor groove interaction the
first extension site. second group polymerases (pol alpha, pol beta, and
t7(-)) fails extend non-h-bonding base pairs, indicating these
enzymes may need minor groove hydrogen bonds minor groove sites that
they especially sensitive noncanonical dna structure stability. dna
polymerases examined use energetically important minor groove interactions to
probe newly synthesized base pairs extending them. positions 
interactions vary among enzymes, subset interactions
identified structurally appears functionally important. addition,
polymerases appear differently sensitive small changes base pair
geometry.
