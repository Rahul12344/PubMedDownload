measles virus (mv), enveloped negative-strand rna virus, remains major cause
of morbidity mortality developing countries. mv predominantly infects
immune cells using signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (slam; also called
cd150) receptor, also infects polarized epithelial cells, forming
tight junctions slam-independent manner. although ability mv to
infect polarized epithelial cells thought important its
transmission, epithelial cell receptor mv identified. a
transcriptional repressor, snail, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(emt), epithelial cells lose epithelial cell phenotypes, as
adherens tight junctions. study, emt induced expressing snail 
in lung adenocarcinoma cell line, ii-18, highly susceptible to
wild-type mv. snail-expressing ii-18 cells lost adherens tight junctions.
microarray analysis confirmed induction emt ii-18 cells suggested a
novel function snail protein degradation distribution. importantly,
wild-type mv longer entered emt-induced ii-18 cells, suggesting the
epithelial cell receptor down-regulated induction emt. other
polarized cell lines, nci-h358 ht-29, also lost susceptibility wild-type
mv emt induced. however, complete formation tight junctions
rather reduced mv entry ht-29 cells. taken together, data suggest that
the unidentified epithelial cell receptor mv involved formation 
epithelial intercellular junctions.
