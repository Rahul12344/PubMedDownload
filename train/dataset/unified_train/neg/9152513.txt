a number distinct viruses known hemorrhagic fever viruses based a
shared ability induce hemorrhage poorly understood mechanisms, typically
involving formation blood clots ("disseminated intravascular
coagulation"). well documented selenium plays significant role in
the regulation blood clotting via effects thromboxane/prostacyclin 
ratio, effects complement system. selenium anticlotting effect,
whereas selenium deficiency proclotting thrombotic effect. also
well documented extreme dietary selenium deficiency, almost never
seen humans, associated hemorrhagic effects animals. thus,
the possibility viral selenoprotein synthesis might contribute to
hemorrhagic symptoms merits consideration. computational genomic analysis
of certain hemorrhagic fever viruses reveals presence potential protein
coding regions (ppcrs) containing large numbers in-frame uga codons,
particularly -1 reading frame. cases, clusterings uga
codons unlikely arisen chance, suggesting ugas may
have function stop codon, encoding
selenocysteine. possible, downstream selenocysteine insertion
element (secis) required. ebola zaire, notorious hemorrhagic fever
virus, pcr 17 uga codons, several potential secis elements 
identified viral genome. one potential viral selenoprotein may contain 
to 16 selenium atoms per molecule. biosynthesis protein could impose an
unprecedented selenium demand host, potentially, leading severe lipid
peroxidation cell membrane destruction, contributing hemorrhagic
symptoms. alternatively, even absence programmed selenoprotein
synthesis, possible random slippage errors would lead increased
encounters uga codons overlapping reading frames, thus potentially to
nonspecific depletion sec host.
