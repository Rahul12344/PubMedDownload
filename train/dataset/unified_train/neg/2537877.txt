cytolytic recognition cmv-infected syngeneic fetal guinea pig cells by
maternal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) suppressed late in
pregnancies uninfected guinea pig breeders less 25% conceptus loss. 
a small subset less successful uninfected pregnancies greater or
equal 50% fetal wastage exhibited partial suppression cytolytic
activity cmv-infected fetal cells. primary cmv infection dams
extending early pregnancy induced augmented cytolysis cmv-infected fetal 
cells, ma104 nk cell targets, throughout gestation resulted 70%
loss conceptus. decreased suppression cytolytic activity against
cmv-infected fetal cells uninfected pregnancy also associated runting
of newborn pups, severe observed congenitally
cmv-exposed cmv-infected pups. congenitally infected pups affected more
than exposed uninfected litter mates. lack suppression cytolysis 
of cmv-infected syngeneic fetal cells, whether spontaneous or
cmv-infection-induced, appears associated poor pregnancy outcome.
