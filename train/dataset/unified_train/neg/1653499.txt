as part efforts produce native molecules host protective antigen
(vp2) infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) microorganisms, have
restored nucleotide sequences encoding vp2 n-terminus present 
in original clone. addition process, produced constructs that
contained +5, +4, -1, -2 frameshifts still allowed expression the
ibdv polyprotein, vp2 vp3. size translation products examination
of nucleotide sequence lead us speculate +1 frameshifting and
internal initiation events lead synthesis ibdv proteins escherichia 
coli.
