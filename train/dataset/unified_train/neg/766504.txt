the sensitivity four strains sh. dysenteriae nine strains
representing serotypes sh. dynsenteriae phages t2, t4 t6 was
examined. different extracts, prepared sensitive strains tested for
their capacity phage inactivation. found receptor substance for
phage t2 localized differently various strains: sh. dysenteriae 7, it
was found bacterial extracts obtained water/phenol 68 degrees c in
extracts obtained trichloracetic acid; sh. dysenteriae 2 sh.
dysenteriae 6, found extracts obtained heating water 65
degrees c. none tested extracts strains sh. dysenteriae 1, sh.
dysenteriae 4 sh. dysenteriae 9, sensitive phage t2 t6 t6,
revealed receptro activity phages. extracts, showed
receptor activity phage t2, appeared weak completely inactive for
phage t6. several strains appeared sensitive phage t4 receptor
active substance found bacterial extracts obtained water/phenol 
68 degrees c. sensitivity sh. dysenteriae smooth strains "rough
specific" t4 phage discussed.
