we assayed variety 7tm chemokine receptors (ccr-2b, ccr-3, ccr-4,
ccr-5, cxcr-1, cxcr-4) two orphan 7tm receptors (v28 ebi.1) their
ability allow infection cd4-negative feline kidney ccc cells hiv-2
strains rod/a rod/b. found rod/b able use cxcr-4 transiently
expressed ccc cells, infection rod/a enhanced 15-fold the
presence scd4. feline ccc cells also became permissive rod/b rod/a
entry transiently transfected chemokine receptor ccr-3 the
orphan 7tm receptor v2b, cultured presence scd4. entry rod/a
into ccc cells expressing ccr-3 could blocked 800 ng/ml eotaxin, the
natural ligand ccr-3.
