poly-gamma-glutamic acid (γ-pga) natural polymer synthesized by
bacillus species reported antitumor activity. aim of
this study investigate effect γ-pga treatment vaginal
intraepithelial neoplasia (vain). retrospective observational study γ-pga
therapy biopsy-proven vain conducted. efficacy assessed by
evaluating results pap cytology viral load high-risk hpv at
three time points: enrollment, first second post-treatment
visits. 17 patients treated γ-pga, 12 patients high-risk
hpv infection included analysis. histology vain1 seven
patients, vain2 two patients, vain3 three patients. γ-pga was
administered newly diagnosed vain five (41.7%) patients persistent
vain seven (58.3%) patients mean time 4.5 months. first 
second post-treatment visits, cytological regression observed five (41.7%)
and six (50%) patients, respectively. regarding hpv load, overall
response rate 66.7%, mean level 670.6 ± 292.5 rlu first
follow-up, lower initial viral load 1,494.8 ± 434.5 rlu (p 
= 0.084). second follow-up, overall response rate 58.3%, the
mean viral load level 924.2 ± 493.7 rlu. γ-pga may helpful the
cytological regression reduction viral load patients high-risk
hpv-positive vain, suggesting γ-pga promising treatment option for
primary persistent vain.
