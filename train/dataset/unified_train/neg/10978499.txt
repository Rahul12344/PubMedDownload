in liver, progressive accumulation connective tissue, complex and
dynamic process termed fibrosis, represents frequent event following a
repeated chronic insult sufficient intensity trigger "wound
healing"-like reaction. fibrotic process recognises involvement of
various cells different factors bringing excessive fibrogenesis
with disruption intercellular contacts interactions extracellular
matrix composition. however, kupffer cells, together recruited mononuclear
cells, hepatic stellate cells far key-players liver fibrosis.
their cross-talk triggered favoured series chemical mediators,
with prominent role played transforming growth factor beta. both
expression synthesis inflammatory pro-fibrogenic cytokine are
mainly modulated redox-sensitive reactions. further, involvement of
reactive oxygen species lipid peroxidation products clearly
demonstrated fundamental events hepatic fibrogenesis, like activation

specific inhibitors. important outcome findings regards the
pathogenesis liver fibrosis derives observation consistent and
marked oxidative stress condition many chronic disease processes
affecting hepatic tissue. hence, reactive oxidant species likely contribute to
both onset progression fibrosis induced alcohol, viruses, iron or
copper overload, cholestasis, hepatic blood congestion.
