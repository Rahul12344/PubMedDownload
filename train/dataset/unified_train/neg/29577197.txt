in culture thp-1 cells differentiated macrophages pma (thp-pma
macrophages) infected influenza viruses subtypes h1, h5 h9, we
measured expression tlr7 rig1 receptor genes, sensors viral rna and
ribonucleoprotein, levels production inflammatory cytokines il-1β, 
tnfα, il-10, ifnα. sensitivity inflammatory response thp-pma
macrophages pandemic influenza virus h1n1pdm09 avian influenza h5n2 
h9n2 viruses correlate intracellular level viral rna and
activation rig1 gene. abortive infection accompanied intensive
macrophage secretion tnfα, il-1β, toxic factors inducing cell death.
activity endosomal tlr7 receptor gene changed insignificantly 24 h after
infection significantly decreased 48 72 h action h5n2 and
h9n2, correlated manifestation cytopathogenic effect these
viruses. h5n2 h9n2 avian viruses thp-pma macrophages strong activators

avian influenza h5n2 h9n2 viruses released rapid induction the
inflammatory response macrophages. late stages infection, we
observed minor increase il-10 secretion macrophages and, probably, the
polarization part population type m2. studied influenza a
viruses weak inductors ifn thp-pma macrophages. culture medium
of thp-pma macrophages infected h9n2 h5n2 viruses, mtt test revealed
high levels toxic factors causing death caco-2 cells. contrast to
avian viruses, pandemic virus h1n1pdm09 induce production toxic
factors.
