exposure immune system environmental antigens infectious agents 
way anal mucosa perianal skin could play important role in
protecting respiratory tract allergic conditions virus
infections. hygienic practices reduced exposure immune system to
such agents include use modern toiletry, disposable diapers clothes
dryers. historically, anal region cleansed following defecation with
natural materials would brought antigens infectious agents the
environment frequent contact perianal skin anal mucosa. this
practice crude form transcutaneous mucosal vaccination, whereby
antigenic agents topically applied skin mucosal surfaces,
penetrate tissues stimulate immune responses extend 
respiratory tract. furthermore, 1960s, diapers cloth items
were often dried outdoors would collected environmental antigens 
that, applied body, could made contact immune system in
the skin. herein, hypothesized prevention allergic rhinitis and
possibly disorders involving immune system could achieved the
daily application preparations composed environmental antigens and
infectious agents anal mucosa adjacent skin. support the
proposal, immunotherapy allergic rhinitis currently involves administration
of specific allergens subcutaneous tissue sublingual mucosa. is
considered superior protection could achieved applying allergens
to anal region would target immune system mucosal
tissue adjacent skin. also hypothesized respiratory viruses
applied anal region would infect tissues site induce immune
responses would protect respiratory tract common cold and
influenza. approach supported evidence orally administered
adenovirus vaccine induce infection intestinal mucosa that
stimulates immunity protect respiratory tract. although respiratory 
viruses unlikely survive passage intestinal tract, rhinovirus 
has rare occasion detected stool specimens, suggesting possibility
of infection terminal end digestive tract. respiratory syncytial
viruses influenza viruses amenable modification reverse genetics
and techniques expected natural modified viruses applied 
to anal region could serve immunize respiratory tract.
