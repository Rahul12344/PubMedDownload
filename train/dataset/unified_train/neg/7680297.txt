antibody binding antigenic regions hepatitis c virus (hcv) envelope 1 (e1; 
residues 183-380, e2/non-structural (ns) 1 (residues 380-437), ns1 (residues
643-690), ns4 (1684-1751) proteins assayed 50 sera antibodies
to hcv (anti-hcv) 46 sera without anti-hcv. thirty-four peptides, 18
residues long eight-amino acid overlap within hcv region, were
synthesized tested 96 sera. within e region 183-380, major
binding site located residues 203-220, recognized eight sera.
within e2/ns1 region 380-437, peptide covering residues 410-427 was
recognized two sera, within ns1 region 643-690, peptides covering
residues 663-690 recognized four sera. within ns4 region 1684-1751,
27 sera reactive one ns4 peptides, 21 these
were reactive peptide 1694-1711. one part major binding site could be
located residues 1701-1704, sequence leu-tyr-arg-glu. igg1, igg3 
and igg4 subclasses reactive five antigenic regions hcv core,
residues 1-18, 11-28, 21-38, 51-68 101-118. reactivity major envelope 
site consisted almost exclusively igg3, reactivity major site of
ns4 consisted igg1. thus, non-restricted igg response linear
hcv-encoded binding sites found core protein, whereas igg
subclass-restricted linear binding sites found within e1 protein, and
within ns4 protein.
