there studies directly comparing efficacy safety telbivudine
and entecavir. present prospective cohort study aimed evaluate the
long-term efficacy safety compounds 196 hepatitis b e antigen
(hbeag)-positive patients chronic hepatitis b median follow-up period 
of 172 weeks; 97 treated telbivudine 99 treated with
entecavir. patients showing suboptimal responses could also take adefovir at
24-48 weeks patients viral breakthrough started adefovir.
the 240-week cumulative proportions patients showing undetectable hepatitis b 
dna levels serum alanine transaminase (alt) normalization similar the
two study groups. viral breakthrough developed 14% telbivudine group
and 2% entecavir group (p 0.002). interestingly, cumulative
proportions patients treated entecavir telbivudine showing hbeag
seroconversion 12% versus 21% 48 weeks (p 0.041), 15% versus 38% 96
weeks (p 0.001), 24% versus 50% 144 weeks (p 0.001), 33% versus 53% 192
weeks (p 0.004) 36% versus 53% 240 weeks (p 0.005), respectively. patients
treated telbivudine therefore significantly likely show hbeag
seroconversion receiving entecavir similar results observed
in study sub-groups matched age, serum alt, hbv dna levels. safety
analysis identified differences grade 3/4 creatine kinase elevations
in study groups telbivudine associated improved kidney
function.
