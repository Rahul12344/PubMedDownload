available, alternative therapeutic strategies used.
areas covered: article summarizes unregistered therapeutics were
used treat patients ebola 2014/2015 outbreak, addition to
approaches used selection candidate drugs. article also proposes
potential theoretical criterion use virtual screening molecular
libraries candidate ebola drugs.
expert opinion: absence approved therapeutics evd, experimental
drugs used. repurposing approved drugs treatment of
evd, alternative therapeutic strategy, also suggested. screening
in vitro- silico-approved drugs revealed several promising candidates 
further testing required test efficacy. therapeutic
approaches are, however, short-term solutions still urgent
