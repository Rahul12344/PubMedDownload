background: japanese encephalitis virus (jev) important cause viral
encephalitis worldwide. pathogenesis probably attributed the
host genetic makeup. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1) monocytes
chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1) play vital role host defense mechanism
against flavivirus causing encephalitis. assessed possible genetic
association icam-1 (k469e) mcp-1-2518 a > g polymorphisms and
japanese encephalitis north indian population.
methods: studied icam-1(k469e) mcp-1-2518 a > g polymorphisms the
help polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(pcr-rflp) analysis. expression icam-1 mcp-1 determined mrna and
protein levels je patients healthy controls real-time polymerase chain 
reaction enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa).
results: homozygous (e/e) genotype icam-1 associated clinical
severity (p = 0.015) outcome (p = 0.04) je, whereas, heterozygous (a/g)
genotype mcp-1-2518 a > g associated outcome je patients
(p = 0.01). among severe cases je, higher level icam-1 observed in
patients e allele (e/k + e/e) icam-1 (k469e) non-e allele (k/k). the
level mcp-1 found significantly increased je patients homozygous
(g/g) genotype compared wild (a/a) genotype mcp-1-2518 a > g
(p = 0.03).
conclusion: icam-1 (k469e) mcp-1-2518 a > g polymorphisms lead increased
level icam-1 mcp-1 japanese encephalitis may associated with
severity well adverse outcome disease. icam-1 (k469e)
polymorphism may affect host susceptibility japanese encephalitis north
indian population.
