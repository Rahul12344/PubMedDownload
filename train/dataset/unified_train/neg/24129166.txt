background: gene therapy, replacing defective gene functional copy, has
been development 40years. initial efforts involved engineering
viral vectors deliver genes appropriate cells. early successes in
severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) later derailed safety issues
including host reaction vector gene insertion near promoters that
favored secondary leukemia.
methods: systematic review literature using pubmed.gov key word gene 
therapy 1972 march 2013. google search key word gene therapy.
results: despite early setbacks, progresses monogenic diseases continued
unabated. patients scids cured first gene therapy been
approved lipoprotein lipase deficiency. many clinical research studies are
ongoing part systematic clinical development program view have
more gene therapies approved.
conclusion: review highlights progresses questions remain be
answered make gene therapy integral part therapeutic arsenal.
