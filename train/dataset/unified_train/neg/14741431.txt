theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (tmev) persists spinal cord white
matter susceptible mice (e.g., sjl/j), resulting chronic inflammation and
demyelination. reconstitution severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice with
cd4(+) t- cd8(+) t-lymphocytes results extensive tmev-induced
demyelination, depletion cd8(+) t-lymphocytes early late phase
of disease decreases extent demyelination, indicating the
cellular immune response virus plays key role myelin
destruction. susceptible mice, demyelinated lesions characterized by
infiltration large numbers b- t-lymphocytes; whereas mice
resistant tmev-induced demyelination (e.g., c57bl/6), virus clearance requires
infiltration 2.9 x 10(5) 5.7 x 10(5) cd8(+) t-lymphocytes and
between 3.4 x 10(5) 6.1 x 10(5) cd4(+) t-lymphocytes per mouse brain
5-9 days post infection. transgenic expression capsid proteins tmev
abrogates resistance c56bl/6 mice, rendering mice susceptible tmev
persistence demyelination. comparison kinetics virus replication
and b- t-lymphocyte infiltration mice lacking key adhesion molecules
(l-selectin (l-sel(-/-)), p-selectin (p-sel(-/-)), intracellular adhesion
molecule-1 (icam-1(-/-)), leukocyte function-associated antigen-1
(lfa-1(-/-))) demonstrates role individual adhesion molecules in
recruitment immune cells central nervous system (cns), role is
not significant prevent eventual virus clearance.
