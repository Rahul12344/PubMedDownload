influenza viruses birds: rapid identification counterimmunoelectrophoresis.

lecomte j, berthiaume l, boudreault a.

counterimmunoelectrophoresis antiserum raised rabbits m
protein avian n virus proved particularly useful large-scale
identification influenza virus isolates. total 231 hemagglutinating 
agents isolated 1,656 rectal swabs collected shore open-country
birds, 158 could identified influenza viruses by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis, 75 serologically related newcastle
disease virus hemagglutination inhibition antiserum newcastle
disease virus. two isolates contained mixture influenza virus and
newcastle disease virus; although newcastle disease virus virus particles
outnumbered influenza virus particles ratio 1,000:1, seen by
electron microscopy, latter could readily detected by
counterimmunoelectrophoresis. type assay appears potential use
for epidemiological surveillance influenza virus isolated humans and
animals. combines specificity, sensitivity, simplicity.
