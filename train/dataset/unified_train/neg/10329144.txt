the ribosomal frameshifting signal present genomic rna coronavirus 
infectious bronchitis virus (ibv) contains classic hairpin-type rna pseudoknot 
that believed possess coaxially stacked stems 11 bp (stem 1) 6 bp
(stem 2). investigated influence stem 1 length frameshift
process measuring frameshift efficiency vitro series ibv-based 
pseudoknots whose stem 1 length varied 4 13 bp single base-pair
increments. efficient frameshifting depended upon presence minimum 11
bp; pseudoknots shorter stem 1 either non-functional reduced
frameshift efficiency, despite fact number stem 1 a
predicted stability equal greater wild-type ibv
pseudoknot. upper limit stem 1 length determined, pseudoknots 
containing 12 13 bp stem 1 fully functional. structure probing analysis
was carried rnas containing either ten 11 bp stem 1; these
experiments confirmed rnas formed pseudoknots appeared be
indistinguishable conformation. thus difference frameshifting
efficiency seen two structures simply due inability the
10 bp stem 1 construct fold pseudoknot. attempt identify other
parameters could account poor functionality shorter stem
1-containing pseudoknots, investigated, context 10 bp stem 1
construct, influence frameshifting altering slippery
sequence-pseudoknot spacing distance, loop 2 length, number g residues
at bottom 5'-arm stem 1. parameter, possible to
find condition modest stimulation frameshifting observable
(about twofold, seven maximal 17 %), unable find a
situation frameshifting approached levels seen 11 bp stem 1
constructs (48-57 %). furthermore, next smaller construct (9 bp stem 1),
changing bottom four base-pairs g.c (the optimal base composition) only
stimulated frameshifting 3 6 %, efficiency tenfold lower than
seen 11 bp construct. thus stem 1 length major factor in
determining functionality class pseudoknot has
implications models frameshift process.
