objective: evaluate safety maraviroc antiretrovirals in
patients hiv-1 coinfected hepatitis b virus (hbv) hepatitis c virus 
(hcv).
methods: multicenter, noncomparative, open-label, expanded access
program (eap) initiated february 2007. patients ccr5-tropic hiv-1 and
hiv-1 rna â‰¥ 1000 copies/ml current treatment received maraviroc 300 mg
(150 mg protease inhibitors) twice daily optimized background therapy
(obt), could include newer agents raltegravir, etravirine, and
darunavir. adverse event (ae) profile compared active and
placebo arms maraviroc phase iii clinical trials motivate 1 2, where
the obt include agents.
results: total 1,032 patients enrolled: 51 hiv/hbv coinfected; 149
hiv/hcv coinfected, 9 hiv/hbv/hcv coinfected, 823 hiv-1 monoinfected. most
(76%) received least 1 newer agent. overall ae frequency comparable across
coinfection groups (63%-72%). hepatobiliary events common hiv/hcv
coinfection hiv monoinfection hiv/hbv coinfection (10.0, 4.8, 3.1 
per 100 patient-years, respectively). across coinfection groups, 
trend toward lower exposure-adjusted rates serious hepatobiliary aes in
the eap motivate studies. grade 3/4 transaminase elevations in
patients receiving maraviroc eap motivate comparable those
seen motivate placebo arm.
conclusion: maraviroc plus obt increase incidence aes severe
laboratory liver abnormalities hiv-1-infected patients coinfected hbv 
hcv.
