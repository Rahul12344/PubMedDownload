we previously shown receptors hemagglutinin of
reovirus type 3 subset murine b cells. using purified reovirus
type 3 particles ligand, followed fitc-labeled antiviral antibody have
now able demonstrate viral induced capping reovirus receptor on
both b cells. kinetic studies inhibition experiments using cytochalasin
b colchicine demonstrate reovirus-induced capping viral receptor 
on b cells characteristics identical capping of
immunoglobulin b cells anti-immunoglobulin reagents. removal viral
receptor reexpression overnight culture demonstrated membrane
treatment proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pronase) viral induced
modulation receptor. protein synthesis required reexpression since
cyclohexamide prevented reexpression receptor culture. co-capping
studies utilizing 2-color immunofluorescence failed identify association
between reovirus receptor variety known surface structures either
b cells, demonstrated independent modulation viral receptor 
other surface structures. studies suggest lymphocyte surface
binding site reovirus type 3 distinct structure behaves identically
in capping studies b cells, protein nature, intimately
linked cell cytoskeleton.
