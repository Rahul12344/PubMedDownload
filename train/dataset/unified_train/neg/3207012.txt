the purpose study identify structural changes organ 
corti correlate retrograde cochlear neuronal degeneration. thirty-eight
temporal bones excellent histological preparation 23 subjects having
hearing losses caused cochlear disease selected study. cytohistograms
were prepared inner outer hair cells, inner outer pillar cells, inner
phalangeal cells, cochlear neurons. extent neuronal degeneration was
found directly related extent injury inner pillar cells and
inner phalangeal cells, loss inner outer hair cells. most
cochleas loss dendritic nerve fibers exceeded loss cell bodies. the
findings support concept retrograde neuronal degeneration initiated
by injury dendritic nerve fibers, secondary collapse and/or
degeneration inner pillar cells inner phalangeal cells.
