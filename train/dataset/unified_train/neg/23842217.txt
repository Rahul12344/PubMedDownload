background: integration hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna host hepatic dna is
found patients without hbv surface antigen (hbsag). investigated the
prevalence hbv integration association outcome of
peginterferon (peg-ifn) ribavirin combination therapy hbsag-negative
chronic hepatitis c patients.
study: analyzed 157 patients chronically infected hepatitis c virus (hcv)
with viral load ≥5.0 log10 iu/ml, underwent peg-ifn ribavirin combination
therapy. hbv integration measured alu-pcr assay liver specimens
obtained needle biopsy treatment.
results: hbv integration identified 54 157 (34.4%) patients. 
were significant differences patients without hbv integration
with regard baseline characteristics including liver histology, pretreatment
hcv rna levels, genetic polymorphisms near il28b gene. patients with
hcv genotype 1b (n=91), favorable viral response observed patients 
with hbv integration therapy, higher rates rapid complete
early virologic response. rate sustained virologic response (svr) was
significantly higher patients hbv integration without
(p=0.0098). multivariate analysis identified hbv integration il28b
polymorphisms independent factors associated svr.
conclusions: hbv integration associated favorable viral responses 
higher svr rate combination therapy peg-ifn ribavirin patients
infected hcv genotype 1b. studies required confirm this
association elucidate underlying mechanisms.
