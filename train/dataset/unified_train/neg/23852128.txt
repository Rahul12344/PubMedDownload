even optimal antiretroviral therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
persists plasma, blood cells, tissues. develop new therapies, is
essential know cell types harbor residual hiv. measured levels hiv 
dna, rna, rna/dna ratios sorted subsets cd4+ cells (ccr7+,
transitional memory, effector memory) non-cd4+ leukocytes blood,
ileum, rectum 8 art-suppressed hiv-positive subjects. levels hiv
dna/million cells ccr7+ effector memory cells higher ileum
than blood. normalized cell frequencies, hiv dna rna the
blood found ccr7+ cells, whereas gut sites, hiv dna rna 
were found effector memory cells. hiv dna rna observed non-cd4+ 
leukocytes low levels, particularly gut tissues. compared blood, the
ileum higher levels hiv dna rna cd4+ cells non-cd4+ t
leukocytes, whereas rectum higher hiv dna levels cell types but
lower rna levels cd4+ cells. future studies determine whether
different mechanisms allow hiv persist distinct reservoirs, the
degree different therapies affect reservoir.
