to establish efficient induction cre mediated dna recombination primary
cells, mouse embryonic fibroblast, keratinocyte, primary preosteoblast, we
tested various recombinant cres fusing protein transduction domain human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) transactivator transcription (tat-ptd) n- 
and/or c-terminus. htc, modified cre ptd n-terminus, achieved the
highest activity dna recombination primary cells.
