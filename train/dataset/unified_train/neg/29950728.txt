mutations ddx3 linked tumorigenesis2-4 intellectual disability5,
and enzyme targeted range viruses6. ded1p orthologues 
engage rnas initiation translation unknown. show, by
integrating transcriptome-wide analyses translation, rna structure and
ded1p-rna binding, effects ded1p initiation translation are
connected near-cognate initiation codons 5' untranslated regions. ded1p
associates translation pre-initiation complex mrna entry channel 
and repressing activity ded1p leads accumulation rna structure
in 5' untranslated regions, initiation translation near-cognate start
codons immediately upstream structures decreased protein synthesis
from corresponding main open reading frames. data reveal program for
the regulation translation links ded1p, activation near-cognate
start codons mrna structure. program role meiosis, a
marked decrease levels ded1p accompanied activation the
alternative translation initiation sites seen activity ded1p
is repressed. observations indicate ded1p affects translation initiation
by controlling use near-cognate initiation codons proximal to
mrna structure 5' untranslated regions.
