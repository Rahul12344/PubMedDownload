the connection human papillomavirus (hpv) infection consequent
sequelae establishes cervical neoplastic transformation invasive
cervical cancer redefined many aspects cervical cancer research. however
there still much know. particular, impact external
factors, like seminal fluid sexually active women, pathways regulate
cervical inflammation tumorigenesis, yet fully understood. hpv
infection regarded initiating noninflammatory cause disease;
however emerging evidence points resident hpv infections drivers of
inflammatory pathways play important roles tumorigenesis well in
the susceptibility infections human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infection. moreover emerging evidence support role seminal
fluid, particular, inflammatory bioactive lipids, prostaglandins which
are present vast quantities seminal fluid regulating pathways can
exacerbate inflammation cervix, speed tumorigenesis, enhance
susceptibility hiv infection. review highlight current
knowledge role seminal fluid potent driver inflammatory and
tumorigenic pathways cervix provide evidence propose a
role seminal plasma prostaglandins hiv infection aids-related cancer.
