bovine leukemia virus (blv), causative agent enzootic bovine leukosis
(ebl) exogenous c-type oncovirus retroviridae family. causes
significant economic losses associated costs control eradication 
programs due carcass condemnation slaughter restrictions export of
cattle semen importing countries. main objective research 
to determine seroprevalence blv infection cattle herds central
region iran (isfahan province) using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (elisa) detect serum antibodies blv. samples blood serum were
collected 403 female dairy cattle (holstein-friesian) 21 livestock
farms 303 animals (81.9%) blv seropositive. significant association
was found age potential risk factor bvl seroprevalence with
animals ≥ 4 years (86.6%) significantly (χ(2) = 35.6, p < 0.001) higher 
seroprevalence compared < 4 years (54.2%). found significant
statistical association seroprevalence pregnancy, lactation status
and farming systems potential risk factors study (p > 0.1). is
concluded blv infection common problem study area. hence,
control measures instituted combat disease studies
are required investigate impact disease dairy production the
country.
