transmission feline viral rhinotracheitis.

gaskell rm, povey rc.

the transmission feline viral rhinotracheitis (fvr) virus investigated.
virus could successfully transmitted shedding carrier cats and
unrelated susceptible kittens, intimate contact between
them. studies transmission fvr virus carrier queens their
kittens showed although four 10 queens shed virus post partum
period, total four kittens three litters developed contact
infection. four kittens remained asymptomatic. two shed one day 
did become carriers (as evidenced corticosteroid treatment) two shed
for 15 days 25 days subsequently shown become carriers. none
of remaining kittens tested shed virus. evidence utero
transmission fvr-recovered queens kittens. passive antibody titres in
kittens born fvr-recovered queens declined less 1 4 individual
animals two 10 weeks age. mean titres calculated linear
regression equation reached less 1 4 less 1 2 six nine
weeks age, respectively. experiments using multistage liquid impinger
demonstrated fvr virus unlikely transmitted cats by
aerosol confirmed ability sentinel cat withstand
virus shedding carriers six month period, although housed same
air space.
