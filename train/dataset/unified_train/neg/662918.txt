the preparation characterization novel series radioactively labeled
membrane probes described. probes carbohydrate derivatives fatty 
acids contain photosensitive azide moiety specified distance along
the alkyl chain. function carbohydrate group restrict azide 
function outer surface monolayer sealed membrane systems. azide
probes used several well-characterized membrane systems including
erythrocyte ghosts, membrane-enveloped viruses, artificial vesicles. upon
activation, probes attach integral proteins form stable, covalent
complex may extracted identified. activation protocol is
outlined preliminary results discussed.
