the development new virus inactivation procedures become area of
growing interest mainly due increased demands concerning safety of
biological products. photochemical processes represent promising methods
for future inactivate viruses. methods, dyes widely 
used photosensitising reagents. current article covers new interesting
alternative, namely use buckminsterfullerene (c60). unique properties 
of molecule make valid candidate future applications the
