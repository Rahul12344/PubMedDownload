our investigations probed nature different t-lymphocyte subsets effecting 
clearance herpes simplex virus infection pinna. cell populations 
from animals recently infected subcutaneously intraperitoneally (acute
population) animals infected 6 weeks previously (primed population) or
the latter cells reimmunized vitro virus (memory population) were
studied. viral clearance function lyt 1+2- subset acute
population, memory population lyt 1+ lyt 2+ cells affected 
clearance. primed populations, viral clearance effected lyt 2+
subset. ability various cell populations adoptively transfer
delayed-type hypersensitivity also studied. acute population cells 
animals infected subcutaneously memory population cells transferred
delayed-type hypersensitivity. cases, cell subtype lyt 1+2-. 
results demonstrated delayed-type hypersensitivity response not
always correlate immunity herpes simplex virus. multiple subsets t
cells participate viral clearance, respective importances vary
according stage virus-host interaction.
