the present study reports effect wssv expression profiles shrimp
ubiquitin gene protein transcript levels different time points
after infection. gradual decrease ubiquitin protein levels observed till
12 hpi (0.25 0.23 μg/mg total protein gills muscle,
respectively) sudden increase 18 hpi (1.86 1.8 μg/mg total
protein gills muscle, respectively). rt-pcr results showed gradual
decrease ubiquitin mrna levels gill tissue till 12 hpi less
constant mrna levels observed muscle tissue till 12 hpi. however, a
fourfold 16 fold induction ubiquitin mrna levels 18 hpi gill and
muscle, respectively suggests possible regulation wssv the
manifestation disease.
