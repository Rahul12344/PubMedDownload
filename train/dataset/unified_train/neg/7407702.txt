isolation preliminary characterization herpes channel catfish virus dna.

robin j, rodrigue a.

the dna channel catfish virus (ccv) selectively extracted infected
cells 5% solution sodium deoxycholate, deproteinized using sodium
sarcosinate pronase, purified phenol extraction followed by
equilibrium density gradient centrifugation cesium chloride solution. ccv
dna displays buoyant density 1.715 g/cm3 solution, would be
expected duplex dna containing 56.1% guanine plus cytosine. as
estimated sedimentation coefficient length electron
microscope, ccv dna linear duplex molecule approximately 85 x 10(6)
daltons.
