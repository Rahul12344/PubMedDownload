primary porcine hepatocytes (pph) currently used research therapeutic 
applications biological component extracorporeal liver assist devices
to overcome shortage human hepatocytes. however, finite life span
and typically rapid loss functions limit utility. immortalized,
nontumorigenic, highly differentiated porcine hepatocyte cell line developed 
in laboratory resolve disadvantages. pph transfected with
simian virus 40 (sv40) antigen control sv40 early promoter.
from established 69 clones, 23 clones displaying hepatocyte-like morphology
were screened diazepam metabolism. one clone, hepliu d63, maintained
in culture > 2 years, 60 passages 240 divisions.
albumin protein, present early passages, lost later passages, but
albumin transcript still detectable later passages. carbamoyl phosphate
synthetase, gateway enzyme urea cycle, consistently detectable in
hepliu cells. cytokeratin 18, characteristic marker primary hepatocytes, was
detected immunofluorescent staining western blot hepliu cells.
furthermore, maintenance p450 functions hepliu cells evidenced by
diazepam 7-ethoxycoumarin metabolites measured hplc. phase ii conjugative 
function measured acetaminophen glucuronidation. p450 dealkylase was
demonstrated microscopically conversion nonfluorescent substrate a
fluorescent product. northern blot analysis immunofluorescent staining
showed sv40 antigen expression nuclei hepliu cells. tumor
formation occurred hepliu cells injected severe combined
immunodeficient (scid) mice tai (a tumor marker) mrna expressed, even
in later passages. immortalized, nontumorigenic, highly functional cell line
may provide valuable tool drug/toxicological studies, liver biologic
regulation studies, artificial liver support systems.
