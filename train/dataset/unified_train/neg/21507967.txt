rift valley fever virus (rvfv), mosquito-borne phlebovirus, detected
in madagascar since 1979, occasional outbreaks. 2008 2009, large
rvfv outbreak detected malagasy livestock humans two successive
rainy seasons. determine whether cases due enzootic maintenance the
virus within madagascar importation east african mainland, nine
rvfv whole genomic sequences generated viruses 1991 2008
malagasy outbreaks. bayesian coalescent analyses available whole s, m, l
segment sequences used estimate time recent common
ancestor rvfvs. 1979 madagascar isolate shared common ancestor with
strains mainland around 1972. 1991 madagascar isolates clade
distinct 1979 isolate shared common ancestor around 1987. 
finally, 2008 madagascar viruses embedded within large clade rvfvs 
from 2006-2007 outbreak east africa shared common ancestor around
2003 2004. results suggest recent madagascar outbreak 
caused virus likely arriving country time 2003 2008 
and outbreak may extension 2006-2007 east african
outbreak. clustering malagasy sequences subclades indicates 
viruses continued evolve short-term circulation within the
country. data consistent notion rvfv outbreaks in
madagascar result emergence enzootic cycles within country 
from recurrent virus introductions east african mainland.
