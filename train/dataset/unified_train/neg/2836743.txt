hamster cells transformed avian sarcoma virus, selected for
resistance 8-azaguanine, cloned. several single cell clones isolated
which differed significantly tumorigenicity comparison the
parental highly tumorigenic cells. nontumorigenic cell clones contained
rescuable avian virus. parental resistant cells possessed transformed
phenotype. comparative studies parental highly tumorigenic cells and
nontumorigenic cell clones failed detect difference expression of
p60src, phosphorylation phosphokinase activity. isolated
nontumorigenic cells represent cell mutants viral src gene is
controlled suppressor gene. cells might useful further
characterization putative antioncogene.
