adeno-associated viruses (aavs) nonpathogenic, nonenveloped, single-stranded 
dna viruses development gene therapy vectors. aav internalization was
postulated proceed via dynamin-dependent endocytic mechanism. revisiting
this, find infectious endocytosis prototypical aav, aav2, is
independent clathrin, caveolin, dynamin. aav2 infection sensitive to
eipa, fluid-phase uptake inhibitor, unaffected rac1 mutants 
macropinocytosis inhibitors. contrast, aav2 infection requires actin
cytoskeleton remodeling membrane cholesterol sensitive inhibition
of cdc42, arf1, graf1, factors known involved formation of
clathrin-independent carriers (clic). aav2 virions internalized the
detergent-resistant gpi-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment (geec)
and translocated golgi apparatus, similarly clic/geec marker
cholera toxin b. results indicate that-unlike viral entry mechanisms
described far-aav2 uses pleiomorphic clic/geec pathway major
endocytic infection route.
