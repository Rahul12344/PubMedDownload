here describe novel (-)ssrna mycovirus, fusarium graminearum
negative-stranded rna virus 1 (fgnsrv-1), isolated fusarium graminearum
strain hn1. genome fgnsrv-1 9072 nucleotides length, five
discontinuous linear orfs (orf i-v). phylogenetic analysis based entire l 
polymerase sequences indicated fgnsrv-1 related (-)ssrna mycovirus
sclerotinia sclerotiorum negative-stranded rna virus 1 (ssnsrv-1), other
mycoviruses. data suggest fgnsrv-1 classified family
mymonaviridae, order mononegavirales. putative enveloped virion-like structures
with filamentous morphology similar ssnsrv-1 observed virion
preparation samples. l proteins fgnsrv-1, fungal
mononegaviruses, found related l protein-like sequences some
fungal genome, supporting hypothesis coevolution occurring
between mycoviruses fungi. besides, clearing virus infected host
fungus resulted discernable phenotypic change.
