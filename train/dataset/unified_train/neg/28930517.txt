high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) oncogenic dna viruses promote
carcinogenic signaling oncoproteins mainly e6 e7. well-defined
promoter regulates expression enhancer region hpv genome containing number
of cis elements essentially require set cognate host transcription
factors regulate viral promoter gene activity. expression host
factors tightly regulated multiple levels transcriptional,
post-transcriptional post-translational level. discovery micrornas (mirs) 
in recent years differential expression set specific mirs hpv
infection cervical lesions indicate among various regulatory mechanisms,
role differentially expressed mirs post-transcriptional control
is pivotal. present review analyses attempts compile currently available
mir data related hpv infection cervical carcinogenesis special
focus mirs may regulate expression host viral factors
particularly responsible viral transcription leading carcinogenic
progression lesion. further, review attempts assess therapeutic
potential mir-based strategies therapeutic targeting hpv infection
during cervical carcinogenesis.
