the toll-like receptor (tlr) family plays instructive role innate immune
responses microbial pathogens, well subsequent induction of
adaptive immune responses. tlrs recognize specific molecular patterns found 
broad range microbial pathogens bacteria viruses, triggering
inflammatory antiviral responses dendritic cell maturation, result 
in eradication invading pathogens. individual tlrs interact different
combinations adapter proteins activate various transcription factors 
as nuclear factor (nf)-kappab, activating protein-1 interferon regulatory
factors, driving specific immune response. review outlines recent
advances understanding tlr-signaling pathways roles immune
responses. further, also discuss new concept tlr-independent mechanisms
for recognition microbial pathogens.
