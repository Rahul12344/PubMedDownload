background: interferons (ifns) extensively studied context
of host defence viral infection. established model ifn action, 
virally infected cells secrete type ifns (ifn-alpha/beta) induce an
antiviral state uninfected cells. however, clear ifns function
on infected cells. reported cells infected viruses
die apoptosis.
results: present study, found three types viruses commonly
induce apoptosis primary cell cultures. importantly, observed that
virus-induced apoptosis inhibited anti-ifn-alpha/beta antibodies, in
cells lacking either type ifn receptor 1 (ifnar1) downstream
mediator, stat1 (signal transducer activator transcription 1). ifn-alpha
treatment induce apoptosis unless combined with
transfection double-stranded rna (dsrna), normally generated during
the course viral infection.
conclusion: results indicate novel antiviral function type ifns,
i.e. selective induction apoptosis virally infected cells. effect,
these ifns bifunctional role limiting spread virus; eliciting an
antiviral state uninfected cells promoting apoptosis infected cells. 
our results may help explain ifns sometimes useful treatment of
viral diseases provide insight mechanisms of
virus-induced pathogenesis.
