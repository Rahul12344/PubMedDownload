children human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection higher
prevalence intestinal malabsorption. anemia also common feature 
children. aims work (a) establish prevalence iron
deficiency hiv-infected children, (b) test hypothesis iron
deficiency related intestinal malabsorption, (c) see whether may
contribute anemia, (d) evaluate sensitivity oral iron load in
the investigation intestinal function. accomplish goals, 71
hiv-infected symptomatic children enrolled. iron serum values were
determined oral load ferrous sulfate. correlation
between basal post-load iron levels evaluated linear regression.
xylose level oral load, fecal fat, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin
concentration also determined. iron deficiency detected 48% of
patients, significantly associated intestinal iron malabsorption.
sugar malabsorption, steatorrhea, fecal protein loss detected 26, 36,
and 17% patients, respectively. low hemoglobin levels detected 66% 
patients. majority children iron deficiency also anemia.
preliminary data showed oral iron administration sufficient raising 
hemoglobin children normal iron absorption, whereas parenteral
administration required iron malabsorption. conclude that
(a) iron deficiency major feature pediatric hiv infection, (b) is
related intestinal malabsorption, (c) contributes anemia. finally,
oral iron load sensitive test investigating intestinal function.
