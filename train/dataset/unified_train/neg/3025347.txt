the antiviral properties herpex simplex virus type 1-specific 'helper' t
cell clone investigated. clone found deficient interleukin 
2 production, although produced interleukin 3 interferon-gamma upon
stimulation virus vitro. supernatants containing lymphokines
were observed increase virocidal activity macrophages vitro and
furthermore induced cells mediate cytotoxic activity against
virus-infected target cells. macrophage activation linked presence 
interferon-gamma clone supernatant. implications results 
protection virus vivo discussed.
