field isolates measles virus (mv) 8-year period four areas of
japan, i.e., osaka, nagoya, tokyo akita, classified three types 
regard electrophoretic mobility hemagglutinin (ha) proteins: type
with small (78k) ha, type intermediate (80 k) ha l type large (82
k) ha. type field isolates closely related geographical
location year virus isolation. type strain isolated 
an outbreak 1983 1984, whereas l type strains isolated
between 1983 1990. ha genes l type strains mv found 
to nucleotide substitution introduces new potential glycosylation 
site. addition, matrix proteins field strains isolated 1977
showed slower electrophoretic mobility 42 k 39 k edmonston and
toyoshima strains. results indicate mv strains different ha types
existed concomitantly major populations mv currently circulating in
japan changing prevalent 1983-1984.
