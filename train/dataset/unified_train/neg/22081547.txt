human rhinovirus (hrv) one common human respiratory pathogens 
is responsible majority upper respiratory illnesses. recently, a
phylogeny constructed known american type culture collection (atcc) 
hrv sequences. study, three hrv classifications (hrva, hrvb, hrvc) 
were determined techniques classifying new isolates hrv reported.
the genetic change virus specific populations time great
interest understand evolution epidemiology viruses. facilitate
the collections hrv sequences number years, virology experiment
was designed students test nasal lavage samples look hrv
infection. students learn variety techniques including rna isolation,
cdna synthesis, qpcr, agarose gel electrophoresis well bioinformatic
skills though examination sequences hrv-field isolates. furthermore, 
students look symptom data subjects investigate correlations
between symptom severity factors stress sleep patterns. such
information used examine hypotheses regarding hrv mutation, symptom
severity epidemiology.
