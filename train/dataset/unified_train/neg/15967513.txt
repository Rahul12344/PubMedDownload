endogenous retroviral sequences (ervs) dynamic genomic components with
profound influences gene expression genomic structure. extent of
expression well known. several broadly targeted real-time reverse
transcription pcr (qpcrs) systems surveillance rna expression major
groups human gammaretroviral ervs constructed. highly conserved
reverse transcriptase (rt) integrase (in) domains pol gene used
as targets pcrs, probe-based (taqman) probe-less
(sybr green). different levels primer probe degeneracy, without
inosine, tested. several pcrs sensitivities herv nucleic
acid copies per pcr reaction. specificities approximately expected from
the fit primers probes. gammaretroviral herv rna expression studied in
different human tissues. herv group specific pattern expression.
herv-e highly expressed testis, herv-i/t brain testis, herv-h in

rna detected plasma 50 blood donors saliva 20 persons. in
conclusion, set tools investigation gammaretroviral herv rna
expression created.
