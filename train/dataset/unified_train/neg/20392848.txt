poxvirus virions, whose outer membrane surrounds two lateral bodies core,
contain least 70 different proteins. f18 phosphoprotein one most
abundant core components essential assembly mature virions. 
report results structure/function analysis role of
conserved cysteine residues, clusters charged amino acids clusters of
hydrophobic/aromatic amino acids assessed. taking advantage a
recombinant virus f18 expression iptg
(isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside) dependent, developed transient
complementation assay evaluate ability mutant alleles f18 support
virion morphogenesis and/or restore production infectious virus. we
have also examined protein-protein interactions, comparing ability mutant 
and wt f18 proteins interact wt f18 interact viral a30
protein, another essential core component. show f18 associates an
a30-containing multiprotein complex vivo manner depends upon
clusters hydrophobic/aromatic residues n' terminus f18 protein
but required assembly complex. finally, we
confirmed two pssp motifs within f18 sites phosphorylation by
cellular proline-directed kinases vitro vivo. mutation these
phosphorylation sites apparent impact virion morphogenesis leads to
the assembly virions significantly reduced infectivity.
