[10·5/1000 vs. 6·0/1000 general population; adjusted risk ratio (rr) 1·84, 95%
confidence interval (ci) 1·39-2·54] highest risk pakistani
ethnicity. however, significant difference ethnicities observed
during following 2010/2011 season. persons living areas highest
level deprivation significantly higher risk death (rr 2·08, 95% ci
