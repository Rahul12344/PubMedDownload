the serological relationships products vitro translation rna 
of various potyviruses analyzed using antisera helper component (hc)
from tobacco plants infected either tobacco vein mottling virus (tvmv) or
potato virus (pvy). pvy-hc antiserum immunoprecipitated specific pvy-rna 
translation product; product reactive antisera pvy-induced
cylindrical inclusion protein capsid protein two tobacco etch virus 
nuclear inclusion proteins. antiserum pvy-hc immunoprecipitate
significant amounts translation products 16 potyviruses including
tvmv. contrast antiserum tvmv-hc efficiently immunoprecipitated a
specific product(s) four different potyviruses, isolates are
poorly transmitted nontransmissible aphids, less efficiently a
product(s) 12 potyviruses, including pvy. distinct serotypes were
resolved among major vitro translation products 17 different potyviral 
rnas antisera tvmv-hc pvy-hc. appears correlation
between serological reactivities hc-related polypeptides ability
of different hc-virus combinations effect aphid transmission virus.
