objective: study evolutionary characteristics rules two lineages on
influenza b virus.
methods: total 126 ha1 sequences strains isolated 1940 2012
were downloaded genbank. time recent common ancestor (tmrca)
and divergence two lineages calculated based data from
phylogenetic analysis ha1 gene, using bayesian markov chain monte carlo
(bayesian-mcmc) molecular clock method.
results: average amino acid variant ratios ranged 5.4% 10.2%
within strains influenza b virus isolated 1978 2010. compared
with victoria-like strains, yamagata-like strains showed amino acid
deletion 163(th) site, showing deletion position 166. 
ha1 gene influenza b virus seemed affected positive selection
except sites. evolutionary average rate ha1 gene 2.138×10(-3)
substitutions/site/year (95% hpd: 1.833×10(-3) - 2.437×10(-3)
substitutions/site/year). estimated dates tmrca two lineages of
influenza b virus could dated back 1971 (95% hpd: 1969 - 1972), the
divergence times two lineages 1973 (95% hpd: 1971 - 1974) 1977
(95% hpd: 1975 - 1978) respectively.
conclusion: significant differences found ha1 gene earlier and
recent identified strains victoria yamagata lineage. differences between
the two lineages increased showing potential dividing 
different subtypes future. attention paid trends
and related epidemiological significance.
