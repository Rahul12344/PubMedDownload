antiretroviral (arv) exposure. investigated possible risks speech
impairments (sis) language impairments (li) preschool monolingual heu
children united states.
methods: speech language assessments conducted part pediatric 
hiv/aids cohort study surveillance monitoring art toxicities study ages 3
(n = 208) 5 (n = 429) years. domains speech, overall language, vocabulary 
and grammar assessed. si li defined standardized scores <15th
percentile categorized primary (normal nonverbal iq â‰¥ 85 without hearing
loss) concomitant (low nonverbal iq and/or presence hearing loss).
logistic regression models used estimate odds si li different 
arv exposures, adjusted confounding variables.
results: risk language impairments heu children higher than
population norms; risk sis elevated. risk factors impairments
included male sex, black race socioeconomic measures, although these
varied age, primary (p) versus concomitant (c) impairment speech or
language measure. adjusted logistic regression models revealed lower and
increased risk specific arvs. tenofovir exposure associated with
increased risk si 3 years age associated decreased risk
for concomitant language impairment 5 years age.
conclusions: investigation combination arv exposure and
speech/language impairment among preschool children needed confirm
