in previous work transferred human factor ix-encoding adeno-associated viral
vector (aav) skeletal muscle men severe hemophilia b. biopsy of
injected muscle 1 year vector injection showed evidence gene
transfer southern blot protein expression ihc immunofluorescent 
staining. although procedure appeared safe, circulating f.ix levels remained 
subtherapeutic (< 1%). recently, obtained muscle tissue subject
injected 10 years earlier died causes unrelated gene transfer. using
western blot, ihc, immunofluorescent staining, show persistent factor ix
expression injected muscle tissue. f.ix transcripts detected injected 
skeletal muscle using rt-pcr, isolated whole genomic dna tested positive 
the presence transferred aav vector sequence. longest reported
transgene expression date parenterally administered aav vector, with
broad implications future muscle-directed gene transfer.
