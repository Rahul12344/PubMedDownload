background: discovery genetically distinct hantaviruses shrews (order
soricomorpha, family soricidae) widely separated geographic regions
challenges hypothesis rodents (order rodentia, family muridae and
cricetidae) primordial reservoir hosts hantaviruses also predicts 
that soricomorphs harbor hantaviruses. recently, novel hantavirus genomes
have detected moles family talpidae, including japanese shrew 
mole (urotrichus talpoides) american shrew mole (neurotrichus gibbsii). we
present new insights evolutionary history hantaviruses gained 
highly divergent hantavirus, designated nova virus (nvav), identified the
european common mole (talpa europaea) captured hungary.
methodology/principal findings: pair-wise alignment comparison the
full-length s- l-genomic segments indicated moderately low sequence
similarity 54-65% 46-63% nucleotide amino acid levels,
respectively, nvav representative rodent- soricid-borne
hantaviruses. despite high degree sequence divergence, predicted
secondary structure nvav nucleocapsid protein exhibited characteristic
coiled-coil domains amino-terminal end, l-segment motifs,
typically found hantaviruses, well conserved. phylogenetic analyses,
using maximum-likelihood bayesian methods, showed nvav formed distinct
clade evolutionarily distant hantaviruses.
conclusions: newly identified hantaviruses harbored shrews moles support
long-standing virus-host relationships suggest ancestral soricomorphs,
rather rodents, may early original mammalian hosts.
