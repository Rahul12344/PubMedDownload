poxviruses virulent vaccinia virus (vacv) strain western reserve encode a
broad range immune modulators interfere host responses infection.
upon 570 vitro passages chicken embryo fibroblasts (cef),
chorioallantois vacv ankara (cva) accumulated mutations resulted highly
attenuated modified vaccinia virus ankara (mva). mva infection mice of
dendritic cells (dc) induced significant type interferon (ifn) responses,
whereas infection vacv alone combination mva not. these
results implied vacv expressed ifn inhibitor(s) functionally
deleted mva. characterize ifn inhibitor(s), infection
experiments carried cva strains isolated 152 (cva152) 386
cef passages (cva386). interestingly, neither cva152 cva386 induced
ifn-alpha, whereas latter variant induce ifn-beta. pattern suggested
a consecutive loss inhibitors mva attenuation. similar supernatants 
of vacv- cva152-infected dc cultures, recombinantly expressed soluble ifn
decoy receptor b18, encoded vacv genome, inhibited mva-induced
ifn-alpha ifn-beta. direction, b18r-deficient vacv variant 
triggered ifn-alpha, confirming b18 soluble ifn-alpha inhibitor.
interestingly, vacv infection inhibited ifn responses induced multitude of
different stimuli, including oligodeoxynucleotides containing cpg motifs,
poly(i:c), vesicular stomatitis virus. collectively, data presented show 
that vacv-mediated ifn inhibition multistep process involving secreted
factors b18 plus intracellular components cooperate efficiently
shut systemic ifn-alpha ifn-beta responses.
