flavonoids found fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, herbs, spices, stems and
flowers, well tea red wine. prominent components citrus 
fruits food sources, consumed regularly human diet, and
have shown many biological functions, including antioxidant and
chelating properties. study suggests features flavonoid structure
necessary act substrate human ugt2b7. generally speaking,
flavonol higher glucuronidation activity flavones isoflavones.
differences c3' position important effect ugt2b7 glucuronidation
activity, various substituents different influences on
glucuronidation activity. flavonol, bulky group c4' enhance
glucuronidation activity. increasing number hydroxyl groups flavonoids 
will increase glucuronidation activity towards ugt2b7, conjugation of
glycon weaken activity, hydroxyl position also important
role activity. high glucuronidation efficiency observed many
flavonoids suggests contribution ugt2b7 metabolism of
flavonoids may significant. results suggest pay
attention glucuronidation activity, also attach importance the
regioselectivity glucuronidation.
