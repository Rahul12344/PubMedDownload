a uracil-to-cytosine point mutation nucleotide (nt) 472 sabin oral
poliovirus vaccine (opv) type 3 found conjunction vaccine-associated
paralytic poliomyelitis (vapp). direct rna extraction mutant analysis by
polymerase chain reaction restriction enzyme cleavage used identify
this point mutation clinical samples. total 238 stool samples were
obtained 28 healthy infants 6 weeks opv vaccination. 25%
of infants shed opv3 week vaccination, decrease day 6. a
second wave opv3 shedding occurred beginning second week vaccination
and maintained end study period. first week
after vaccination, proportion nt 472 mutants shed opv3 increased
from undetectable almost 100%. second shedding period, the
proportion nt 472 mutants remained close 100%. results suggest that
selective mutation drives vapp-associated nt 472 point mutation opv3 in
the human gastrointestinal tract.
