pip: review recent results research herpesvirus presented a
tentative association cervical cancer proposed. 2 types virus have
been identified, hsv-1 causes fever blisters lip sores hsv-2 which
causes genital lesions. structure composition virus described. 
in addition, mechanisms productive nonproductive infection cellular
level reviewed. pathogenesis hsv-1 hsv-2 infections varies
according previous exposure, whether patient compromised medical
condition newborns. many primary infections subclinical, however when
apparent severe recurrent cases. infections localized to
superficial areas skin mucous membranes, may due virus'
inability spread connective tissue, variation tissue
susceptibility, proclivity dissemination blood nerves immune
responses. primary oral infections range inapparent severe
gingivostomatitis extensive ulceration mouth, tongue gum, fever, 
and adenopathy. occular conditions include conjunctivitis, cataracts,
iridocyclitis, panuveitis. genital infection occurs cervix and
external genitalia women penis, urethra, prostate seminal vesicle 
in men. cases neonatal disease caused hsv-2. neurologic
manifestations associated virus include encephalitis, meningitis and
myelitis. recurrent disease consists localized vesicular lesions caused by
various stress factors. suspected recurrences virus has
persisted interim noninfectious form close site the
recurrency. data several studies support hypothesis. research 
mechanism virus persistence recurrence focusing host cell and
the role immune factors. diagnosis largely clinical although some
laboratory aids useful. among drugs used prevention therapy,
the application vital dye neutral red proflavine, followed by
exposure light successful recurrent lesions. research is
warranted use fever therapy interferon. recently hespesvirus 
been associated cancer least 6 cases. interpretation data from
animal well human studies suggestive link explanatory
factors ruled out.
