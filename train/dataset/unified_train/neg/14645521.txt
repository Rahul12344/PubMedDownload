although human papillomavirus (hpv) e7 oncogene known contribute the
development human cervical cancer, mechanisms carcinogenesis are
poorly understood. first identified recognized function e7 its
binding inactivation retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (prb), 
least 18 biological activities also reported e7. thus, it
remains unclear many activities contribute oncogenic
potential e7. used cre-lox system abolish prb expression the
epidermis transgenic mice compared outcome effects e7
expression tissue early ages. mice lacking prb epidermis showed
epithelial hyperplasia, aberrant dna synthesis, improper differentiation. 
addition, rb-deleted epidermis (i.e., epidermis composed cells rb
deleted) exhibited centrosomal abnormalities failed arrest cell cycle 
in response ionizing radiation. transgenic mice expressing e7 skin display 
the range phenotypes. sum, differences detected between
rb-deleted epidermis e7-expressing epidermis young mice. however, when
both e7 expressed rb deleted tissue, increased
hyperplasia dysplasia observed. findings indicate that
inactivation rb pathway largely account e7's phenotypes an
early age, prb-independent activities e7 detectable vivo.
