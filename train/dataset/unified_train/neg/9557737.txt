pseudorabies virus (prv), swine neurotropic alphaherpesvirus, known to
invade central nervous system (cns) variety animal species through
peripherally projecting axons, replicate parent neurons, pass
transsynaptically infect neurons circuit. studies human
pathogen herpes simplex virus type 1 reported differences direction
of transport two strains virus direct injection primate
motor cortex. present study examined direction transport of
virulent attenuated strains prv, utilizing injections rat
prefrontal cortex evaluate specific movement virus cns circuitry.
the data demonstrate strain-dependent patterns infection consistent with
bidirectional (anterograde retrograde) transport virulent virus and
unidirectional (retrograde) transport attenuated prv site of
injection. distribution infected neurons extent transsynaptic
passage also suggest release defect attenuated strain reduces the
apparent rate viral transport neuronal circuitry. finally, injection
of different concentrations virus influenced onset replication within a
neural circuit. taken together, data suggest viral envelope
glycoproteins virus concentration site injection important
determinants rate direction viral transport multisynaptic
circuit cns.
