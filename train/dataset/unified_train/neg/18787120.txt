immunological memory hallmark adaptive immunity, understanding cell
memory central development effective cell-mediated vaccines.
the characteristics functions cd4 memory cells well defined.
here demonstrate increased size secondary response solely a
consequence increased antigen-specific precursor frequency within the
memory pool. memory cells proliferated less primary responding cells, even
within host. analyzing entry primary memory cells the
cell cycle, found two populations proliferated similarly day 5;
after time, fewer reactivated memory cells proliferated. this
time, fewer reactivated memory cells made il-2 primary responding
cells, made ifngamma. factors affected low proliferation 
of memory cells, either exogenous il-2 inhibition ifngamma
increased proliferation memory cells.
