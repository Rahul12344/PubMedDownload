human lipocalin-1 (lcn-1, also called tear lipocalin), member lipocalin 
structural superfamily, produced number glands tissues is
known bind unusually large array hydrophobic ligands. apart its
specific function stabilizing lipid film human tear fluid, is
suggested act physiological scavenger potentially harmful lipophilic
compounds, general. characterize proteins involved reception,
detoxification, degradation ligands, cdna phage-display library
from human pituitary gland constructed screened proteins interacting 
with lcn-1. using method lcn-1 interacting phage isolated that
expressed novel human protein. molecular cloning analysis entire
cdna indicated encodes 55-kda protein, lipocalin-1 interacting membrane
receptor (limr), nine putative transmembrane domains. cell membrane
location protein confirmed immunocytochemistry western blot
analysis membrane fractions human nt2 cells. independent biochemical
investigations using recombinant n-terminal fragment limr also demonstrated 
a specific interaction lcn-1 vitro. based data, suggest limr 
to receptor lcn-1 ligands. findings constitute first report 
cloning lipocalin interacting, plasma membrane-located receptor, general.
in addition, sequence comparison supports biological relevance this
novel membrane protein, genes significant nucleotide sequence
similarity present takifugu rubripes, drosophila melanogaster,
caenorhabditis elegans, mus musculus, bos taurus, sus scrofa. according to
data derived human genome sequencing project, limr-encoding gene has
to mapped human chromosome 12, intron/exon organization could be
established. entire limr-encoding gene consists 13.7 kilobases in
length contains 16 introns length 91 3438 base pairs.
