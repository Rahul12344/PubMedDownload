ribosome-inactivating proteins (rips) angiosperms rrna n-glycosidases
that proposed defence proteins virus fungi. have
been classified type 1 rips, consisting single-chain proteins, type 2
rips, consisting chain rip properties covalently linked b chain
with lectin properties. work carried broad search rip
sequence data banks angiosperms order study main structural
characteristics phylogenetic evolution. comparison sequences
revealed presence, outside active site, novel structure that
might involved internal protein dynamics linked enzyme catalysis.
also b-chains presented another conserved structure might function
either supporting beta-trefoil structure communication both
sugar-binding sites. systematic phylogenetic analysis rip sequences revealed
that primitive type 1 rips similar actual monocots
(poaceae asparagaceae). primitive rips evolved dicot type 1
related rips (like caryophyllales, lamiales euphorbiales). the
gene type 1 rip related actual euphorbiaceae type 1 rips fused with
a double beta trefoil lectin gene similar actual cucurbitaceae lectins 
generate type 2 rips finally gene underwent deletions rendering
either type 1 rips (like cucurbitaceae, rosaceae iridaceae) or
lectins without chain (like adoxaceae).
