the occurrence propagation enteric viruses rivers constitute major
public health issue. however, little information available situ
transport spread viruses surface water. study, original in
situ experimental approach using residence time river water mass was
developed accurately follow propagation f-specific rna bacteriophages
(frnaphs) along 3-km studied river. surface water sediment 9 sampling
campaigns collected analyzed using infectivity rt-qpcr assays. 
in parallel, physico-chemical variables flow rate, water
temperature, conductivity total suspended solids measured investigate
the impact environmental conditions phage propagation. campaigns with
low flow rate high temperature, results highlight decrease of
infectious phage concentration along river, successfully modelled
according first-order negative exponential decay. monitoring of
infectious frnaphs belonging mainly genogroup ii confirmed direct
phage genotyping total phage particle quantification. reported k decay
coefficients according exponential models allowed determination the
actual situ distance time necessary removing 90 % infectious phage 
particles. present work provides new way assess true situ viral 
propagation along small river. findings highly useful water
quality risk assessment studies determine viral contamination spread
from point contamination source nearest recreational areas.
