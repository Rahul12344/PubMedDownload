arthritogenic alphaviral infection begins febrile illness often
progresses joint pain rheumatic symptoms described as
polyarthritis. alphaviral arthritis classical arthritides share many similar 
cellular immune mediators involved pathogenesis. recent vitro and
in vivo evidence suggests bone loss resulting increased expression of
bone resorption mediators may accompany alphaviral infection. addition,
several longitudinal studies reported severe delayed recovery of
alphaviral disease patients pre-existing arthritic conditions. this
review aims provide insights alphavirus-induced bone loss focuses 
aspects disease exacerbation patients underlying arthritis on
possible therapeutic targets.
