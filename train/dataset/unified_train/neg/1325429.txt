the core sequence enhancer murine leukemia virus (mulv) long terminal
repeat highly conserved large number mulv strains appears play 
an essential role sl3-3 moloney strains induce cell lymphoma mice.
we found using electrophoretic mobility shift assay polyomavirus
enhancer core-binding protein, pebp2, bound core motif mulv. also
noted pebp2 several hematopoietic cell lines derived b lymphocyte,
macrophage myelocyte lineages migrated significantly faster the
authentic pebp2 detected nih3t3 fibroblasts. interestingly, pebp2 detected 
the cell lines lymphocyte lineage appeared contain types, were
indistinguishable electrophoretic mobility nih3t3 b
lymphocyte, macrophage myelocyte lineages. treatment nuclear
extract containing pebp2 phosphatase generated pebp3, a
subcomponent pebp2 retained dna-binding specificity pebp2. the
altered mobility hematopoietic cell-derived lymphocyte-derived pebp2 
found due alteration mobility pebp3. based distinct
mobility pebp2/3 lymphocytes hematopoietic cells, 
discuss implication pebp2 mulv-induced cell leukemia t
cell-specific gene expression.
