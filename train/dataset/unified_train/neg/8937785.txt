the microvasculature cerebral cortex aids brains investigated by
means stereology light electron microscopic levels. stereologic
parameters microvessels determined formalin-fixed autopsy tissue of
24 aids patients 35 age- sex-matched controls. light
microscopic level encompassed measurement diameter, volume
fraction, surface area density, length density; electron microscopic
level profile area, perimeter, diameter capillaries, endothelial cells,
pericytes, basal lamina well mean thickness basal lamina
were measured. aids brains significant increase diameter cortical 
vessels noted. surface area density (sv) volume fraction (vv) of
microvessels likewise significantly increased aids brains. changes
were noted length density (lv) also indicates changes in
the number vessels occur hiv-1 infection. ultrastructural thinning the
basal lamina consistent finding. vacuoles occurred basal lamina of
capillaries increased number size aids brains. using morphometric
methods, significant changes cortical vessels detectable light 
electron microscopic level. changes probably represent the
morphological substrate altered blood-brain-barrier aids brains may 
account reported hypoperfusion demonstrated spect analyses.
