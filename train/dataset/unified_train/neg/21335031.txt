uncertainties shortcomings associated current influenza vaccine
production processes demand attention exploration new vaccine manufacture 
technologies. based newly developed mammalian cell culture-based production 
process investigated selected process parameters describe three factors
that shown impact productivity, process robustness development time.
they time infection, harvest time virus input, multiplicity of
infection (moi). defining time infection 4-5 days post cell seeding 
and harvest time 2-3 days post-infection comparing effect virus
production, moi subsequently identified impactful process
parameter live attenuated influenza vaccine (laiv) manufacture. infection 
very low moi (between 10(-4) 10(-6) ffu/cell) resulted high titer virus
production (up 30-fold productivity improvement) compared higher moi
infections (10(-3) 10(-2) ffu/cell). application findings allowed
us develop platform process reduce development time to
approximately three weeks influenza vaccine manufacture process new
strains.
