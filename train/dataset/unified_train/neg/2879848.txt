intracellular distribution active inactive transglutaminase stimulated 
cultured c6 glioma cells.

korner g, bachrach u.

the cellular distribution active inactive transglutaminase (tgase) was
studied c6 glioma cells stimulation serum-containing
medium. activity enzyme determined soluble insoluble
fractions obtained freezing thawing cells, followed centrifugation 
at 12,000g 5 min. soluble fractions, activity tgase decreased
2.5 h post-stimulation increased 5 8 h. corresponding
insoluble fractions, significant changes activity enzyme were
noted 8 h stimulating cells fresh medium. immunological
approach next used determine quantity tgase antigen the
stimulation cultured glioma cells. soluble fraction, quantity
of antigen decreases significantly 2.5, 5, 8 h. contrast, the
insoluble fraction, significant increase tgase antigen detected 8 h
after addition fresh medium. cycloheximide completely inhibited the
increase quantity tgase antigen insoluble fraction, 8 h
post-stimulation, actinomycin caused partial inhibition. trypsin,
neuraminidase, sendai viruses increased activity tgase significantly,
when added nonstimulated cells. trypsin effect tgase activity when
added cells 2 h stimulation serum-containing medium. these
findings suggest inactive form enzyme present insoluble 
cellular fraction. model proposed explain variations tgase
activity, distribution translocation cellular stimulation.
