polyclonal rabbit antisera produced coat protein bean golden
mosaic virus brazil isolate (bgmv), cabbage leaf curl virus (cablcv), tomato
yellow leaf curl virus (tylcv), tomato mottle virus (tomov), expressed in
escherichia coli peth expression vector. expressed coat protein of
each virus purified sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis use immunogen. antisera bgmv, cablcv, tylcv, and
tomov reacted indirect (plate-trapping) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(elisa) extracts begomovirus-infected tissue. antisera bgmv,
cablcv, tylcv, tomov also reacted specifically test begomovirus
antigens leaf imprint blots western blots. cablcv tylcv antisera
were used detect bean golden yellow mosaic virus antigens immunogold
labeling thin sections infected bean tissues. tissue blot immunoassays, 
the tylcv antiserum reacted well tylcv antigens tomov antigens,
while cablcv antiserum reacted well tomov antigens weakly tylcv
antigens. results indicate polyclonal antisera prepared expressed
begomovirus coat proteins useful detection begomoviruses an
array assays.
