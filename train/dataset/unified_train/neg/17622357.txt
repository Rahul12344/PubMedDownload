cancer complex, multi-step process characterized misregulated signal
transduction altered metabolism. cancer cells divide faster normal cells
and growth rates reported correlate increased metabolic
flux cell transformation. report progressive changes in
essential elements biochemical network, vitro model of
transformation, consisting primary human keratinocytes, human keratinocytes
immortalized human papillomavirus 16 (hpv16) passaged repeatedly vitro,
and extensively-passaged cells subsequently treated carcinogen
benzo[a]pyrene. monitored changes cell growth, cell size energy
metabolism. transformed cells smaller divided faster, the
cellular energy flux unchanged. cell transformation protein
synthesis network contracted, shown reduction key cap-dependent
translation factors. moreover, progressive shift towards internal
ribosome entry site (ires)-dependent translation. switch cap to
ires-dependent translation correlated progressive activation c-src, an
activator amp-activated protein kinase (ampk), controls energy-consuming
processes, including protein translation. cellular protein synthesis a
major energy-consuming process, propose reduction cell size and
protein amount provide energy required cell survival proliferation. the
cap ires-dependent switch seems part gradual optimization of
energy-consuming mechanisms redirects cellular processes enhance cell
growth, course transformation.
