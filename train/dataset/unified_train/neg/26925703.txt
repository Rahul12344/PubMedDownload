chikungunya virus (chikv) transmitted infected mosquito probes host
skin. probing, mosquito saliva expectorated host skin along with
virus contains cocktail molecules anti-hemostatic and
immunomodulatory properties. mosquito saliva critical factor during
natural arboviral infection, therefore investigated mosquito saliva induced
cutaneous events modulate chikv infection. effect mosquito saliva 
chikv infection examined inoculation suckling mice subcutaneously 
with either chikv alone uninfected mosquito bite followed chikv.
histopathological evaluation skin revealed infiltration transmigrated
inflammatory cells. dermal blood vessels hyperemic adnexa showed
degenerating lesions. severe hemorrhage observed dermis hypodermis 
mosquito bite+chikv group compared chikv group. analysis cytokines skin 
showed significant downregulation inflammatory genes like tlr-3, il-2, ifn-γ, 
tnf-α ifn-β mosquito bite+chikv group compared chikv group. in
contrast, significant upregulation anti-inflammatory genes like il-4 il-10
was observed. early events might responsible increased
dissemination chikv serum peripheral organs demonstrated through
>10-fold higher viremia, antigen localization, cellular infiltration and
degenerative changes. thus mosquito saliva induced early cellular infiltration
and associated cytokines augment chikv pathogenesis mouse model. this
mosquito improved chikv mouse model simulates realistic conditions occur
naturally infected mosquito bite host. lead better
understanding chikv pathobiology promote evaluation novel medical
countermeasures emerging chikv.
