to investigate efficacy long-term lamivudine (3tc) adefovir dipivoxil 
(adv) combination therapy 3tc-resistant chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv)
infected patients, analysed 28 3tc-resistant patients treated the
combination therapy 47 months (range, 9-75). 12, 24, 36, 48 months,
the rates virological response undetectable hbv dna (≤ 2.6 log copies/ml)
were 56, 80, 86, 92%, respectively. among 17 hepatitis b e antigen
(hbeag)-positive patients, hbeag disappeared 24% 12 months, 25% 24
months, 62% 36 months, 88% 48 months. hbv genotypes compared,
patients genotype b achieved virological response significantly rapidly
than genotype c (p=0.0496). one patient developed virological
breakthrough 54 months, sequence analysis hbv obtained the
patient performed. rta200v mutation present majority hbv
clones, addition 3tc-resistant mutations rtl180m+m204v. rtn236t 
adv-resistant mutation observed 25% clones. vitro analysis showed 
that rta200v mutation recovered impaired replication capacity the
clone rtl180m+m204v mutations induced resistance adv. moreover,
rtt184s rts202c, known entecavir-resistant mutations, emerged in
some rtl180m+m204v clones without rta200v rtn236t. conclusion, 3tc+adv
combination therapy effective 3tc-resistant patients, especially
with genotype b hbv, risk emergence multiple drug-resistant strains
with long-term therapy considered. mutation rta200v with
rtl180m+m204v may sufficient failure 3tc+adv therapy.
