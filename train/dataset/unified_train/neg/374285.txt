g mice carrying fv-4r resistant allele supported virus growth neither an

mice, resistan-e g mice could transferred fv-4-susceptible mice.
conversely, transfer bone-marrow spleen cells fv-4-susceptible mice
rendered g mice susceptible. could concluded that, assessed virus

bone-marrow-derived cells, fv-4 gene expressed cells.
