hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural proteins major components of
replication complex modulated several host factors. previously
reported nucleolin, representative nucleolar marker, interacts the
ns5b two separated sequences, amino acids (aa) 208-214 500-506, and
that w208 former stretch essential nucleolin-binding hcv
replication. evaluated role latter stretch aa 500-506 of
wrhrars nucleolin-binding hcv replication scanned alanine-substituted
clustered mutant (cm) point mutant (pm). one tryptophan three arginine
residues sequence found essential nucleolin-binding in
vivo hcv replication detected hcv subgenomic replicon transfected into
huh7 cells. ns5b-binding nucleolin delineated truncation and
clustered mutants nucleolin. arginine-glycine-glycine (rgg) repeat the
glycine arginine rich (gar) domain defined indispensable for
ns5b-binding immunologically detected vivo vitro although short
internal-truncations rgg repeat tolerable ns5b-binding. results 
indicate nucleolin critical host factor hcv replication the
direct interaction w208 several residues sequence, aa 500-505,
of ns5b, long-turn motif including rgg repeat nucleolin c-terminal.
