as leading infectious cause death worldwide primary proximal cause
of death individuals living hiv, tuberculosis remains global concern.
existing tuberculosis control strategies rely passive case-finding appear
insufficient achieve targets reductions tuberculosis incidence and
mortality. active case-finding strategies aim detect infectious individuals
earlier infectious period reduce onward transmission improve
treatment outcomes. empirical studies active case-finding produced mixed 
results determining direct active screening risk
remains topic intense research. systematic review literature
evaluating effects geographically targeted tuberculosis screening
interventions found three studies low tuberculosis incidence settings, but
none conducted high tuberculosis incidence countries. discuss open
questions related use spatially targeted approaches active
screening countries tuberculosis incidence highest.
