studies nasal t/natural killer (nk)-cell lymphoma hampered its
tendency cause necrosis. thus, establishment cell lines this
neoplasm would seem valuable. study attempted establish cell lines 
from primary lesions tumor, successfully obtained 2 novel
epstein-barr virus (ebv)-positive cell lines, snk-6 snt-8, means of
high-dose recombinant interleukin 2. flow cytometry showed snk-6 an
nk-cell phenotype, cd3- cd4- cd8- cd19- cd56+ t-cell receptor (tcr) alpha/beta-
tcr gamma/delta-, whereas snt-8 cd3+ cd4- cd8- cd19- cd56+ tcr alpha/beta-
tcr gamma/delta+. consistent immunophenotypes original
tumors, cell lines monoclonal ebv clones identical ones their
original tumors. thus, cell lines developed cells forming primary
lesions. genotypic analysis showed snk-6 unrearranged tcr and
immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes, supporting conclusion snk-6 of
nk-cell lineage. hand, snt-8 rearranged tcr beta-, gamma-, and
delta-chain genes, together phenotype, snt-8 proved a
gammadelta t-cell line. first report establishment cell
lines primary lesions nasal t/nk cell lymphomas, results
demonstrated least 2 lineages, nk- gammadelta t-cell, in
this neoplasm. moreover, suggested nasal t/nk cell lymphomas 
these lineages may belong clinicopathologic entity types
of cases shared common clinical histopathologic features.
