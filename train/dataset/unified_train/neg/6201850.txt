the early simian virus 40 (sv40) gene product, large tumor (t) antigen, is
responsible initiation viral dna replication autoregulation of
early gene expression direct protein-dna interactions. investigated
the role antigen late viral gene expression, independent function 
in amplifying templates dna replication. sv40 dna transfected into
bsc-1 cos-1 cells cultured presence inhibitors dna
replication. electrophoretic immunoblot analysis indicated onset
and extent sv40 late gene expression increased cos-1 cells, which
constitutively express sv40 antigen. blot hybridization analysis of
poly(a)-selected rna demonstrated level synthesis major late
structural protein vp-1 cos-1 cells due increased transcription.
similar results obtained plasmids contain sv40 late gene but
lack origin viral dna replication early gene coding region
were transfected onto cos-1 cells. using lines sv40-transformed monkey kidney 
cells express altered antigens, found enhanced expression the
late gene product correlated ability antigen bind sv40 dna.
these results indicate large antigen plays role stimulation of
late viral gene expression.
