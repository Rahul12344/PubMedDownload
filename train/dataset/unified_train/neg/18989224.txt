background: infection human herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) common among men who
have sex men (msm) north america europe also found be
endemic regions south america. little known hhv-8 prevalence 
and correlates among msm andean region.
methods: assessed hhv-8 seroprevalence among 497 msm recruited 2002
peruvian hiv sentinel surveillance program using combined hhv-8 enzyme
immunoassay immunofluorescence assay algorithm. logistic regression analysis 
was used estimate odds ratios (ors) 95% confidence intervals (cis)
to determine association selected covariates hhv-8
seropositivity.
results: one hundred thirty-one (66.5%, 95% ci 63.1% 69.9%) 197
hiv-infected 80 (26.7%, 95% ci 24.4% 29.0%) 300 hiv-uninfected msm 
serologic evidence hhv-8 infection. factors independently associated with
hhv-8 infection education<12 years (or 1.7, 95% ci 1.1 2.7), anal
receptive sex last partner (or 2.0, 95% ci 1.2 3.3), self-reported
sexually transmitted infection symptoms last year (or 1.9, 95% ci 1.2 
to 3.0), coinfection hiv (or 4.2, 95% ci 2.8 6.4) chronic hepatitis b
(or 4.9, 95% ci 1.5 15.8). msm long-standing hiv infection more
likely serologic evidence hhv-8 infection compared men 
recently acquired hiv (or 3.8, 95% ci 1.7 9.1).
conclusions: hhv-8 infection common among hiv-infected hiv-negative
msm lima, peru. hhv-8 seropositivity correlated anal receptive sex,
self-reported sexually transmitted infection symptoms, hiv infection among
these msm thus seems sexually transmitted. hhv-8 infection seems 
acquired hiv infection, suggesting future studies evaluate 
mode hhv-8 transmission prevention strategies among hiv-uninfected msm.
