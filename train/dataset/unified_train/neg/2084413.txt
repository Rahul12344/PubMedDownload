the aim present study identify useful serum markers for
the early identification infection human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv). end, sequential serum samples 19 individuals later had
seroconversion anti-hiv evaluated. p24 antigen (ag-hiv) the
earliest marker infection, although could detected five of
the 19 individuals: two isolated marker remaining four
associated anti-hiv (first generation western blot: wb-1, recombinant
enzyme immunoanalysis: eia-2g). 12 19 individuals, wb-1g (pasteur) 
the technique permitted earliest detection anti-hiv: five cases
with bands made unequivocal diagnosis infection, seven
with indeterminate results (anti-hiv core envelope antigens). the
second earliest test detection anti-hiv envelope antigens with
a competitive eia-2g (abbott). wb-1g (sorin) detected anti-hiv late phase,
as case eia-1g eia-2g anti-hiv antigens encoded 
the gag gene. results indicate may remarkable differences 
sensitivity among different commercial kits. use eia ag-hiv
together wb-1g shortens gap period hiv infection, even if
seroconversion identified eia-2g global anti-hiv.
