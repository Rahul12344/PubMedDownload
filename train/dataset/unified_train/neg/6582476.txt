a molecular approach leukemogenesis: mouse lymphomas contain activated
c-ras oncogene.

guerrero i, calzada p, mayer a, pellicer a.

by inducing mouse thymomas carcinogens gamma-radiation, studied 
the potential tumor dna induce foci rodent fibroblasts. high
percentage tumors used transformed cultured cells, oncogenic
phenotype segregated extra copies c-ras gene family. appears to
be selectivity activated gene far analyzed tumors induced
by carcinogen activated n-ras gene, induced radiation 
activated k-ras gene. k-ras gene cellular counterpart viral
ras oncogene kirsten murine sarcoma virus, n-ras yet been
found retrovirus. transformed cells marked increase expression
of oncogene rna protein level. model system might a
powerful tool study leukemogenesis.
