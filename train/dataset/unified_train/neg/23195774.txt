genetic modifications tobacco mosaic virus (tmv) coat proteins allow for
an increase selective deposition controlled growth different metals
onto surface virus, making ideal biotemplate metal nanowire 
formation. current process, tmv2cys coated sequentially multiple
uniform layers palladium metal aqueous solution mild conditions.
palladium nanowires 300 nm length 30-40 nm diameter been
created process. transmission electron microscopy (tem) small angle
x-ray scattering (saxs) used characterize thickness uniformity 
the metal surface. tem saxs results confirm final thickness of
the palladium nanowires controllable varying number coating layers
or initial palladium concentration.
