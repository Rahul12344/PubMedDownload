here present genome sequence novel dsrna virus designed as
rhizoctonia solani rna virus hn008 (rsrv-hn008) filamentous fungus r.
solani. genome (7596 nucleotides) contains two non-overlapping open reading
frames (orf1 orf2). orf1 encoded 128 kda protein showed significant
identity virus sequence ncbi database. orf2 encoded protein
with molecular weight 140 kda shared low percentage sequence
identity rdrps unclassified dsrna viruses. sequence analysis revealed
that rsrv-hn008 may member novel unclassified family mycoviruses.
