the hiv-1 gp120-gp41 complex, mediates viral fusion cellular entry,
undergoes rapid evolution within external glycan shield enable escape from
neutralizing antibody (nab). understanding conserved protein determinants
retain functionality context evolution important their
evaluation exploitation potential drug and/or vaccine targets. this
study, examined conserved gp120-gp41 association site, formed the
n- c-terminal segments gp120 disulfide-bonded region (dsr) of
gp41, adapts glycan changes linked neutralization sensitivity. 
this end, dsr mutant virus (k601d) defective gp120-association was
sequentially passaged peripheral blood mononuclear cells select suppressor 
mutations. reasoned locations suppressors point structural
elements functionally linked gp120-gp41 association site. in
culture 1, gp120 association viral replication restored loss the
conserved glycan asn¹³⁶ v1 (t138n mutation) conjunction l494i
substitution c5 within association site. culture 2, replication was
restored deletion n¹³⁹inn sequence, ablates overlapping
asn¹⁴¹-asn¹⁴²-ser-ser potential n-linked glycosylation sequons v1, in
conjunction d601n dsr. 136 142 glycan mutations appeared to
exert suppressive effects altering dependence gp120-gp41
interactions dsr residues, leu⁵⁹³, trp⁵⁹⁶ lys⁶⁰¹. 136 and/or 142
glycan mutations increased sensitivity hiv-1 pseudovirions the
glycan-dependent nabs 2g12 pg16, also pooled igg obtained from
hiv-1-infected individuals. thus adjacent v1 glycans allosterically modulate 
distal gp120-gp41 association site. propose represents mechanism
for functional adaptation gp120-gp41 association site evolving
glycan shield setting nab selection.
