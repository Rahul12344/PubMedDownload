hepatitis c virus (hcv) modern-day pandemic; 2-3% world's population 
are thought infected virus subsequently risk of
developing end-stage liver diseases. traditional standard care (soc) for
hcv-infected patients limited regimen pegylated-interferon alpha
(pegifn) ribavirin; displaying low cure rates majority patients and
severe side effects. however, 2011 first direct-acting antivirals (daa)
were licensed treat hcv-infected patients combination soc, which
served elevate treatment response rates. hcv drug development pipeline 
currently populated many additional improved daas; primarily molecules
that target virus-encoded protease polymerase enzymes. molecules are
being evaluated combination traditional soc together with
other daas all-oral pegifn-free regimens ultimate goal developing 
multiple daa-containing hcv therapies rely pegifn backbone. a
recent addition arsenal hcv inhibitors development represented by
an entirely new daa class; molecules target hcv-encoded non-enzymatic
ns5a protein. ns5a essential hcv propagation and, although actual
functions largely unknown, likely key regulator viral genome
replication virion assembly. protein exquisitely sensitive small
molecule-mediated inhibition; ns5a-targeting molecules probably most
potent antiviral molecules ever discovered exhibit number other
attractive drug-like properties, including activity many hcv
genotypes/subtypes once-daily dosing potential. although mechanism of
action unclear, ns5a-targeting molecules already proving utility 
clinical evaluation; particularly components pegifn-sparring daa
combination regimens. review aim amalgamate current
understanding knowledge ns5a-targeting molecules; discovery,
properties, applications, insight future impact components of
all-oral pegifn-free daa combination therapies combat hcv infection.
