the effectiveness nucleoside analogs blocking viral multiplication was
evaluated using immortalized human neuroglial cell line capable sustaining 
a persistent jcv infection, svg-jc. results situ dna hybridization and
hemagglutination assays performed drug treated cultures used measure
of viral dna replication multiplication, respectively. three drugs
tested, ara-c (cytosine arabinoside), azt (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), and
cidofovir (s)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonylmethoxypropyl] cytosine), ara-c
showed significant effect decreasing active jcv replication and
multiplication. vitro data, using different cell types virus strains 
shown specific drugs indeed modulate viral infection. however, such
modulation previously demonstrated cells cns which
are specifically targeted jcv. svg-jc cells represent unique system with
which studies conducted effects drugs brain derived
cells susceptible viral infection.
