we previously shown protein derived p7 nucleocapsid (nc)
protein hiv type-1 increases kcat/km kcat cleavage cognate
substrate hammerhead ribozyme. show directly increase in
kcat/km arises catalysis annealing rna substrate the
ribozyme increase kcat arises catalysis dissociation the
rna products ribozyme. peptide polymer derived consensus
sequence c-terminal domain hnrnp a1 protein (a1 ctd) provides
similar enhancements. although effects apparently arise non-specific
interactions, non-specific binding interactions led these
enhancements. nc a1 ctd exert effects accelerating attainment the
thermodynamically stable species throughout ribozyme catalytic cycle. in
addition, nc protein shown resolve misfolded ribozyme-rna complex is
otherwise long lived. vitro results suggest non-specific rna
binding proteins nc hnrnp proteins may biological role rna 
chaperones prevent misfolding rnas resolve rnas misfolded, 
thereby ensuring rna accessible biological functions.
