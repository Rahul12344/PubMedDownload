it postulated cancer result genetic epigenetic changes that
occur mainly stem (precursor) cells various cell types. propose that
there three classes genes involved development cancer.
these are: class i, ii iii oncogenes. classification based way 
the oncogene acts cellular level development cancer.
genetic changes, point mutations, deletions, inversions, amplifications
and chromosome translocations, gains losses genes or
epigenetic changes genes (e.g. dna hypomethylation) gene
products (rna protein) responsible development cancer. changes 
of oncogene activity genetic epigenetic origin result in
quantitative qualitative differences oncogene products. are
involved changing normal cells cells demonstrating cancer phenotype
(usually form dedifferentiated cell) multistep process. are
several pathways cancer intermediate steps necessarily defined
in orderly fashion. activation particular class ii oncogene and
inactivation class iii oncogene could occur step the
development cancer. benign malignant tumors consist heterogeneous
mixture dedifferentiated cells arising single cell.
