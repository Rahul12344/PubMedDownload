rice stripe virus (rsv) serious negative effect rice production in
temperate regions east asia. focusing putative importance the
selection target sequences rna interference (rnai), analysed the
effects potential target sequences coding genes rsv
genome, using transgenic rice plants expressed set inverted-repeat (ir)
constructs. reactions inoculated transgenic t(1) plants rsv were
divided subjectively three classes, namely highly resistant, moderately
resistant lacking enhanced resistance rsv, even though plants that
harboured constructs accumulated transgene-specific sirnas prior to
inoculation rsv. transgenic plants harboured ir constructs specific for
the gene pc3, encodes nucleocapsid protein, pc4, encodes 
a viral movement protein, immune infection rsv resistant
to infection natural resistant cultivars used control 
the disease field. contrast, ir construct specific gene for
pc2, encodes glycoprotein unknown function, p4, encodes 
a major non-structural protein unknown function, result resistance.
our results indicate rnai constructs viral rnas equally 
effective preventing rsv infection important identify the
viral 'achilles heel' rnai attack engineering plants.
