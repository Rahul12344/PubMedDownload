recent studies underscore importance crosstalk tumor-associated
macrophages (tams) tumor cells cancer progression metastasis. our
study, adcd68stat3β, recombinant adenovirus containing stat3β gene driven 
cd68 macrophage-specific promoter, used suppress stat3 downstream 
signaling pathways tams. results showed stat3β gene control
of cd68 macrophage-specific promoter expressed macrophages, which
significantly inhibited motility invasion breast cancer cells when
co-cultured 4t1 cells. moreover, cell-specific stat3β expression tams
extended survival tumor-bearing mice suppressed breast tumor growth,
angiogenesis metastasis, regulating crosstalk tumor cells 
tams. therefore, study provided novel strategy antitumor effects of
stat3β.
