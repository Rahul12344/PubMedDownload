infectious bursal disease (ibd) considered vital viral disease that
threatens poultry industry worldwide. study, recombinant single
chain variable fragment (scfv) antibody library derived chickens immunized
with vp2 protein infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) constructed. the
library subjected three rounds screening flow cytometry (fcm)
against vp2/ibdv bacteria display technology, resulting the
enrichment scfvs. three scfv clones different fluorescence intensity were
obtained colony pick random. obtained scfv antibodies expressed
and purified. relative affinity assay showed three clones different
sensitivity vp2, accordance fluorescence activity cell sorting
analysis (facs). potential use isolated ibdv-specific scfv antibodies 
was demonstrated successful application antibodies western
blotting elisa assay. what's more, vitro neutralization measurement showed
that one three isolated antibodies possessed neutralization function
against ibdv. study provides new strategies screening antibody
library, scfv antibodies isolated study may utilized lead
candidates development diagnostic therapeutic antibodies for
detection treatment ibdv infection.
