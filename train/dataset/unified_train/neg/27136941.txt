introduction: lassa virus (lasv), prominent human pathogen the
arenaviridae, transmitted humans infected rodents cause lassa 
fever (lf). sizeable disease burden west africa, numerous imported lf
cases worldwide, possibility lasv used agent of
biological warfare make strong case vaccine development. no
licensed lasv vaccines antiviral treatment limited off-label use
of ribavirin partially effective.
areas covered: lasv vaccine development hampered high cost of
biocontainment requirement, absence appropriate small animal models,
genetic diversity lasv species, high hiv-1 prevalence lasv endemic
areas. past 15 years several vaccine platforms developed.
natural history lasv pathogenesis disease provide strong
justification replication-competent (rc) vaccine one feasible 
approaches control lf. development lasv vaccine candidates based on
reassortant, recombinant, alphavirus replicon technologies covered this
review. expert commentary: two lead rc vaccine candidates, reassortant ml29 and
recombinant vsv/lasv, successfully tested non-human primates and
have recommended international vaccine experts rapid clinical
development. platforms powerful molecular tools secure
safety, improve immunogenicity, cross-protection. platforms well
positioned design multivalent vaccines protect lasv strains
citculatrd west africa. regulatory pathway candid #1, first
live-attenuated arenaviral vaccine argentine hemorrhagic, a
reasonable guideline lasv vaccine efficacy trials.
