the paramyxovirus f protein class viral membrane fusion protein which
undergoes significant refolding transition virus entry. previous studies
of newcastle disease virus, human parainfluenza virus 3 parainfluenza
virus 5 f proteins revealed differences pre- post-fusion structures.
the ndv queensland (q) f structure lacked structural elements observed the
other two structures, key refolding fusogenic activity f.
here present ndv australia-victoria (av) f protein post-fusion structure
and provide em evidence folding pre-fusion form. ndv av f
structure contains heptad repeat elements missing previous ndv q f
structure, forming post-fusion six-helix bundle (6hb) similar the
post-fusion hpiv3 f structure. electrostatic temperature factor analysis of
the f structures points regions proteins may functionally
important membrane fusion activity.
