objective: investigate clinical pathology recurrent hepatitis b after
orthotopic liver transplantation (olt).
methods: clinical manifestation hepatic pathological characteristics of
12 patients recurrent hepatitis b olt examined study by
using hematoxylin eosin staining,immunochemical staining hepatitis b
surface antigen hepatitis b core antigen,tissue situ hybridization of
hepatitis b virus (hbv) dna, mallory's trichrome staining.the survival rate
of olt patients assessed kaplan-meier analysis.
results: early stage recurrent hbv infection patients olt was
characterized active hbv replication mild-to-moderate inflammation 
liver. three 12 patients treated combination therapy group
were carriers ymdd mutants three showed improvement liver function 
and hepatic histology receiving adefovir dipivoxil,instead lamivudine,in
the early stage recurrent hepatitis b olt. among patients treated
with lamivudine monotherapy, four achieve improvement early stage 
of recurrent hepatitis b developed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (fch).
conclusion: recurrent hepatitis b patients underwent olt characterized
by mild-to-moderate viral hepatitis early stage fch later
stage. effective antiviral intervention early stage may reverse recurrent 
hepatitis b prevent disease progression fatal fch.
