gag-specific ctls known stronger ability control hiv-1 replication
than others protein-specific. therefore, analysis gag escape
mutants expected clarify mechanisms immune control hiv-1-infected
donors. however, limited number gag escape mutants identified
so far. previous study suggested possibility gag28-3r (kw9-3r) an
escape mutant hla-a*2402-restricted kw9-specific ctls show any
evidence it. sought demonstrate kw9-3r selected escape
mutant kw9-specific ctls. kw9-specific ctls showed remarkable reduction in
recognition target cells infected kw9-3r mutant. sequence
analysis hiv-1 58 hiv-1-infected individuals showed frequency of
the kw9-3r mutant significantly higher hla-a*2402(+) individuals in
hla-a*2402(-) individuals. longitudinal analysis hla-a*2402(+) individual
with hiv-1 early infection showed escape mutant selected an
approximately 2-year period. results together indicate gag28-3r 
escape mutant selected hla-a*2402-restricted kw9-specific ctls. further
analysis epitope clarify role hiv-1-specific ctls the
control hiv-1 among japanese population, since 70% carry this
allele.
