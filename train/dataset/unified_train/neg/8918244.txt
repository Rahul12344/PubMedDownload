we investigated requirements necessary high-level production 
hepatitis b virus (hbv strain ayw) large surface glycoprotein pres1 vaccinia
virus (vv) recombinants. earlier studies, nanogram amounts pres1 could
be obtained cells infected appropriate recombinant vv carrying the
pres1 gene transcriptional control conventional vv promoter
(p7.5). here, report use improved promoter system, i.e., the
bacteriophage t7 polymerase/vv hybrid expression system (t7/emc system) in
combination g-c conversion position 5 pres1 open reading frame, 
deleting myristylation motif polypeptide, results least
12-fold increase pres1 expression compared wild-type pres1 expressed
with strongest homologous vv promoter system known far. although the
t7/emc promoter system effective, improved expression modified
pres1 (pres1dmyr) independent promoter system used, the
insertion locus modified pres1 within vv genome also cell
line used expression studies.
