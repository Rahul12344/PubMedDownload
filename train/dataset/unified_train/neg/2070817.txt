herbimycin a, known inactivate degrade p60v-src tyrosine
kinase, induced elevated synthesis protein molecular size 70
kda a431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. protein showed same
migration distance sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the
protein induced cells heat shock treatment, 70-kda protein was
identified member heat shock protein 70 family (hsp70) through
immunoprecipitation anti-hsp72/73 antibody partial digestion v8
protease. induced level 70-kda protein dependent length 
period concentration herbimycin treatment. cellular fractionation
and indirect immunofluorescence analyses revealed 70-kda protein induced
by herbimycin localized cytoplasm, contrast nuclear
distribution hsp70 induced heat treatment. induction hsp70 herbimycin
a also observed several cells, including hela s3 cells, chicken
embryo fibroblasts, nih3t3 cells, rous sarcoma virus-transformed nih3t3
cells.
