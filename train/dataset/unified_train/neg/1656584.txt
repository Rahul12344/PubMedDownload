dna encoding complete sequence herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1)
glycoprotein h (gh) inserted baculovirus transfer vector control
of baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter. co-transfection wild-type
baculovirus dna, recombinants expressing gh isolated plaque purification.
the baculovirus-expressed hsv-1 gh represented significant portion total
cellular protein several hundred fold abundant gh in
hsv-1-infected vero cells. expressed gh appeared glycosylated, since it
was similar size wild-type hsv-1 gh, susceptible tunicamycin
and endoglycosidase-h treatment, labeled [3h]mannose. contrast to
previous reports gh expressed mammalian cells, baculovirus
recombinant-expressed gh abundant cell surface judged indirect
immunofluorescence. knowledge, first report expressed hsv-1
gh transported cell surface absence hsv-1 gene
products first report expressed gh apparent molecular weight
similar authentic hsv-1 gh.
