picornavirus replication causes leakage cytoplasmic k+ influx na+
and ca2+. study, explored possibility blockade ca2+
and na+ influx would reduce rhinovirus production and/or release. the
ca2+-channel blockers, verapamil diltiazem, well blocker na+/h+ 
exchange epithelial na+ channel, eipa, inhibited virus production
and release. effect virus release pronounced effect on
production, thus raising possibility rhinovirus release may serve a
target antiviral agents. unexpectedly, results also showed the
antiviral activity ca2+-channel blockers due block ca2+ 
influx. similarly, antiviral activity eipa appeared unrelated the
blockade cellular na+/h+ exchanger epithelial na+ channel. potential
alternative mechanisms antiviral activity compounds are
discussed.
