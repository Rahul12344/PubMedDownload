tp53 gene mutations occur 30 55% hepatocellular carcinomas. the
frequency type p53 mutations hcc vary according geographical
location tumors. specific mutation codon 249 (agg-->agt) found at
high frequency tumors high aflatoxin-areas. tp53 mutations other
geographic locations less frequent scattered exons encoding the
central region protein. tp53 mutations observed hepatocellular
carcinoma accompanied loss wild-type p53 function. moreover, the
p53-249ser mutant appears display gain function degree. in
addition p53 inactivation gene mutation, growing evidence the
wild-type p53 functions inactivated hbx protein hepatitis b
virus. hepatocellular functions wild-type p53 protein entirely
known. present data suggest dna damaging agents induce p53-dependent
cell cycle arrest apoptosis cell lines derived normal liver or
hepatocellular carcinoma. contrast, exposure mice genotoxic agents
does induce p53-dependent changes normal adult liver. could due to
the fact hepatocytes adult liver quiescent cells.
