formalin fixed liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, duodenum appendix tissues 
from nine rabbits, experimentally infected rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
(rhdv), investigated evidence rhdv antigen direct
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemical method. rabbits
examined, rhdv antigen detected degenerative necrotic hepatocytes of
the liver tissues. area involved coincided histopathological lesions 
serial liver sections. rhdv antigen expressed cytoplasm the
hepatocytes, suggesting rhdv replicated cells. rhdv antigen was
also detected spleen. results immunohistochemistry supported
by demonstration rhdv protein western blot analysis rhdv
