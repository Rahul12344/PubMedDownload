alterations intracellular monovalent cation concentrations sindbis
virus-infected avian cells result, part, reduction na+/k+ atpase
(na+ pump) activity. inhibition na+ pump activity shown previously to
temporally correlate appearance viral envelope proteins cell
surface release virus particles. cells infected with
envelope-defective temperature-sensitive mutants exhibited reduced na+ pump
activity nonpermissive temperature, viral particles not
released. contrast, na+ pump activity inhibited sindbis
virus-infected cells treated tunicamycin antiviral serum, which
block virus maturation release. diuretic-sensitive transport 86rb+, ak+
tracer, stimulated cells express virus envelope proteins, fail
to release virus particles. cells, furosemide-sensitive 86rb+ influx
exhibited increase vmax responsive changes extracellular 
concentration nacl. furosemide inhibited rapid release virus low
salt-inhibited cells shift isotonic conditions. alterations ion
transport alphavirus infection may, therefore, facilitate efficient
release progeny virus particles.
