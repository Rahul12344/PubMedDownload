the endogenous retroviral envelope protein syncytin involved cell fusions
and also associated immunomodulatory functions. syncytin is
currently known expressed placenta, testis brain well in
breast endometrial carcinomas. using newly developed monoclonal syncytin
antibody assessed syncytin expression retrospective series 140
colorectal cancer patients. variable degrees syncytin expression detected
in colonic rectal tumors prognostic impact expression
was analysed kaplan-meier method cox proportional hazard model. 
interestingly, increased syncytin expression associated decreased
overall survival rectal colonic cancer patients. thus, the
prognostic impact syncytin expression appears vary tumor type.
