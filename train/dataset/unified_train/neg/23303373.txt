ticks transmit variety viral, bacterial protozoal pathogens, are
often zoonotic. aim study identify diverse tick microbiomes,
which may contain as-yet unidentified pathogens, using metagenomic approach.
dna prepared bacteria/archaea-enriched fractions obtained seven tick
species, namely amblyomma testudinarium, amblyomma variegatum, haemaphysalis
formosensis, haemaphysalis longicornis, ixodes ovatus, ixodes persulcatus and
ixodes ricinus, subjected pyrosequencing whole-genome amplification.
the resulting sequence reads phylotyped using batch learning
self-organizing map (blsom) program, allowed phylogenetic estimation based 
on similarity oligonucleotide frequencies, functional annotation blastx
similarity searches. addition bacteria previously associated with
human/animal diseases, anaplasma, bartonella, borrelia, ehrlichia,
francisella rickettsia, blsom analysis detected microorganisms belonging to
the phylum chlamydiae tick species. confirmed pan-chlamydia
pcr sequencing analysis. gene sequences associated bacterial
pathogenesis also identified, suspected originate from
horizontal gene transfer. efforts construct database tick microbes 
may lead ability predict emerging tick-borne diseases. furthermore, a
comprehensive understanding tick microbiomes useful understanding 
tick biology, including vector competency interactions pathogens and
symbionts.
