background: overexpression p16(ink4a) suppression p53 rb
proteins key features oncogenic transformation human papillomaviruses
(hpv) anogenital cancers. hpv genomes often detected cancers the
oral cavity, unclear whether hpv specific oncogenic role there.
objectives: objectives study investigate expression of
p53, rb, p16(ink4a) proteins identify hpv infection viral integration
into host genome.
methods: seventy-nine cases oral squamous cell carcinoma (oscc) studied
by immunohistochemistry. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed to
identify hpv dna samples. results correlated clinical
data.
results: thirty-three cases hpv positive high-risk hpv (hr-hpv) types,
of 27 harbored hpv16. 25 27 hpv16-positive tumors, hpv16 genome
was fully integrated host genome, evidenced lack of
pcr-amplifiable e2 gene sequences. forty-five patients p53 overexpressing,
20 hr-hpv-positive 25 hr-hpv-negative tumors. p16(ink4a) protein
was overexpressed 4 31 hr-hpv-positive 9of 45 hr-hpv-negative cases.
twenty-six 32 hr-hpv-positive 37 44 hr-hpv-negative samples exhibited
prb nuclear staining. differences hr-hpv-positive -negative
tumors statistically significant. correlation found these
biological factors tumor location, stage, differentiation grade, alcohol
or tobacco abuse.
conclusions: tumor immunophenotype, similar hpv-related anogenital cancers, 
is present oscc highly oncogenic hpv types therefore unlikely to
be specific independent risk factors oral cancer.
