vaccinia virus assembles two distinct lipoprotein membranes. primary membrane
contains nonglycosylated proteins, appears crescents cytoplasm, and
delimits immature mature intracellular virions. secondary wrapping
membrane contains glycoproteins, derived virus-modified trans-golgi or
endosomal cisternae, forms loose coat around intracellular mature virions,
and becomes envelope extracellular virions. although mode formation
of wrapping membrane partially understood, know less primary 
membrane. recent reports posit primary membrane originates the
endoplasmic reticulum-golgi intermediate compartment (ergic). according this
model, viral primary membrane proteins cotranslationally inserted er
and accumulate ergic. test ergic model, employed sar1(h79g), a
dominant negative form sar1 protein, essential component of

because proteins essential secondary membrane retained
