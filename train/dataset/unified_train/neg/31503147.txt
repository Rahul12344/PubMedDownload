objective: evaluate efficacy incisional negative pressure wound therapy
in prevention postoperative wound morbidity women class iii
obesity undergoing cesarean delivery.
methods: open label randomized controlled trial, women admitted for
delivery class iii obesity (body mass index 40 higher) measured within 2 
weeks admission delivery offered participation study. they
were consented either outpatient maternal-fetal medicine specialty clinic,
during admission labor delivery decision perform cesarean 
delivery, preoperative area hospital scheduled cesarean
delivery. exclusion criteria included anticoagulation therapy, human
immunodeficiency virus infection, silver acrylic allergy. who
ultimately underwent cesarean delivery randomized standard surgical
dressing incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressing. primary
outcome wound morbidity. preplanned secondary outcomes included
characteristics composite wound morbidity, hospital, emergency room, and
clinic utilization. sample size estimate required randomization 440 women 
to detect 50% decrease composite outcome.
results: january 1, 2015, july 31, 2016, 850 women screened 
677 women class iii obesity enrolled. these, 441 underwent cesarean 
delivery subsequently randomized (219 standard dressing 222 to
incisional negative pressure wound therapy). primary outcome, overall
composite wound morbidity rate, 18%. different two
cohorts (incisional negative pressure wound therapy 17% vs standard dressing 19%,
relative risk 0.9 [95% ci 0.5-1.4]).
conclusion: prophylactic incisional negative pressure wound therapy use not
reduce postoperative wound morbidity compared standard surgical
dressing women class iii obesity.
