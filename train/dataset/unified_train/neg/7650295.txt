in 54 patients chcv infection, peripheral immune responsiveness soluble 
mediator release evaluated. results demonstrate patients
phagocytosis killing capacities exerted polymorphonuclear cells and
monocytes profoundly depressed. time, absolute numbers cd3+, 
cd8+ cd16+ cells reduced, cd4(+)-cd8+ dependent antibacterial 
activity also impaired. special reference soluble mediators, elevated
amounts soluble interleukin-2 receptor soluble intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 detected sera patients. contrast, serum levels tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha within normal ranges, whereas interferon-gamma serum
concentrations decreased. note, 18.5% chcv patients circulating
levels bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps) detected means limulus
assay. limulus+subset patients, absolute numbers cd14+ cells were
reduced significant manner, implying putative monocyte-lps
interaction. conclusion, overall results indicate condition of
peripheral immune depression chcv patients exaggerated shedding of
various mediators endowed noxious effects host.
