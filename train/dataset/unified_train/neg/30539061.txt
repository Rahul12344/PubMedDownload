innate immune cells key player immune response influenza virus
infection. influenza infected monocytes exacerbate disease pathology.
however, monocytes differ susceptibilities influenza virus infection.
herein, susceptibilities u937 thp-1 monocytic cells pr8 virus
infection, associated cellular factor- sialic acid (sa) receptor distribution
and viral factor determined. moreover, amino acid sequences hemagglutinin
(ha) receptor binding domain (rbd) pr8 virus determine sa preferences
were analysed. pr8 infected u937 cells express significantly higher numbers of
nucleoprotein positive cells suggesting u937 cells susceptible to
influenza virus thp-1 cells. lectin staining suggested similar pattern sa
receptor distribution cells. interestingly, sequence analysis rbd
suggested preferences alpha 2,3 sa receptors suggesting rbd sequences
are always determining sa preferences. furthermore, resistance
barrier thp-1 cells overcome h5n1 ns gene. conclusion, study
demonstrated decreased susceptibility thp-1 cells pr8 virus could 
be related sa receptor distribution, h5n1 ns gene sufficient to
determine tropism thp-1 cells. hence, mechanistic basis ns gene cell
tropism contribution internal genes remained determined.
