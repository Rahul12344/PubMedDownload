in past years important advances made understanding of
the molecular mechanisms leading x-linked lymphoproliferative disease (xlp).
it possible identify gene defective xlp demonstrate
that, normal individuals, encodes src homology 2 domain-containing
protein 1 (sh2d1a) plays crucial role signaling via number of
surface molecules expressed cells immune system. present variety
of mutations identified result lack defective sh2d1a
molecules. importantly, recently demonstrated lack sh2d1a
affects function surface molecules involved mechanism of
natural killer-mediated recognition killing epstein-barr virus-infected b 
cells.
