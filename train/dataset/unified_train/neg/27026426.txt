background/objectives: investigate effect folate status cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) progression relationship high-risk
human papillomavirus (hrhpv).
subjects/methods: evaluated 20 000 sexually active women aged <65 years in
yangqu county using questionnaire; subjects also screened using the
thinprep cytologic test (tct). patients abnormal tct results (other than
glandular cell abnormalities) willing provide informed consent were
further diagnosed using colposcopy histopathological examination. we
investigated 247 cases low-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions
(lsil), 125 cases high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsil) 
and 877 controls. 24-item food frequency questionnaire filled the
investigator estimate consumption dietary folate. positivity hrhpv 
from residual exfoliated cervical cells tested; serum folate also
measured.
results: hrhpv infection rate hsil patients (77.6%) higher that
in lsil (33.2%) control (32.0%) patients. dietary folate intakes controls,
lsil hsil 306.9±176.6, 321.8±168.0 314.7±193.8 μg/kcal,
respectively. levels serum folate controls, lsil hsil were
18.2±7.9, 15.9±7.1 14.3±7.5 nmol/l, respectively. increased cin correlated
with higher rates hrhpv infection lower levels serum folate.
conclusions: low levels serum folate may increase risk cin progression.
furthermore, potential synergy may exist low serum folate levels and
hrhpv infection promote cin development.
