schizophrenia devastating psychiatric disorder impacts social
functioning quality life, accumulating evidence that
inflammation potential pathogenic mechanism schizophrenia. however, the
mechanism inflammation possibly occurred schizophrenia well
understood. endogenous retroviral protein syncytin-1 inflammatory marker 
crp abnormally expressed schizophrenia patients. crp one the
markers bacterial infection generally. less clear whether virus viral
protein trigger activation crp. here, detected robust increase of
the levels syncytin-1 crp schizophrenia patients, displayed a
positive correlation marked consistency expressions syncytin-1 and
crp schizophrenia patients. furthermore, overexpression syncytin-1
significantly elevated levels crp, tlr3, il-6 human microglia 
and astrocytes. tlr3 deficiency impaired expressions crp il-6 induced 
by syncytin-1. importantly, observed cellular co-localization direct
interaction syncytin-1 tlr3. additionally, knockdown il-6
inhibited syncytin-1-induced crp expression. thus, totality these
results showed viral protein syncytin-1 could trigger activation crp,
which might explain elevated crp sterile inflammation exhibit novel 
mechanism regulation inflammation syncytin-1 schizophrenia.
