the incidence de novo development esophageal varices (ev) patients 
compensated liver cirrhosis determined studies short term 
and never long term. aims present study determine the
incidence risk factors associated development ev to
assess whether antiviral treatment achievement sustained virologic
response (svr) may prevent de novo ev development patients hcv-induced
cirrhosis. studied 218 patients compensated ev-free, hcv-induced
cirrhosis consecutively enrolled 1989 1992 three referral centers 
in milan, italy. endoscopic surveillance performed 3-year intervals
according international guidelines. svr defined undetectable serum
hcv-rna 24 weeks treatment discontinuation. median follow-up of
11.4 years, 149/218 (68%) patients received antiviral treatment 34 (22.8%)
achieved svr. none svr patients developed ev compared 22 (31.8%) of
the 69 untreated subjects (p < 0.0001) 45 (39.1%) 115 non-svr patients
(p < 0.0001). multivariate analysis, hcv genotype 1b (hazard ratio [hr] 2.40; 
95% confidence interval [ci] 1.17-4.90) baseline model end-stage liver
disease (meld) score (hr 1.20; 95% ci 1.07-1.35 1 point increase) were
independent predictors ev.conclusion: long term, achievement svr
prevents development ev patients compensated hcv-induced
cirrhosis. therefore, patients, endoscopic surveillance safely
delayed avoided. genotype 1b infection meld score identify subset of
patients higher risk ev development need tailored endoscopic
surveillance.
