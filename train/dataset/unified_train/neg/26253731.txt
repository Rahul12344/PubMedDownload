dysfunctional cells present malignant lesions characterized a
sustained highly diverse expression inhibitory receptors, also referred to
as immune checkpoints. yet, relative functional significance different
cancer types remains incompletely understood. study, provide a
comprehensive characterization diversity expression patterns of
inhibitory receptors tumor-infiltrating cells patients non-small
cell lung cancer. spite large heterogeneity observed amount of
pd-1, tim-3, ctla-4, lag-3, btla expressed intratumoral cd8(+) cells
from 32 patients, clear correlation established increased
expression inhibitory coreceptors progression disease.
notably, latter accompanied progressively impaired capacity t
cells respond polyclonal activation. coexpression several inhibitory
receptors gradually acquired, early pd-1 late lag-3/btla expression.
pd-1 blockade able restore t-cell function subset patients. a
high percentage pd-1(hi) cells correlated poor restoration of
t-cell function upon pd-1 blockade. note, pd-1(hi) expression marked a
particularly dysfunctional t-cell subset characterized coexpression of
multiple inhibitory receptors thus may assist identifying patients likely 
to respond inhibitory receptor-specific antibodies. overall, data may
provide framework future personalized t-cell-based therapies aiming at
restoration tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte effector functions.
