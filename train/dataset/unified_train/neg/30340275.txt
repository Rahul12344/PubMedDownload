the ability escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium,
human adenovirus serotype 2 (hadv2) murine norovirus 1 (mnv-1) survive 
river water -20, 4, room temperature (~24 °c) 37 °c, evaluated 
dark conditions. tested surface water obtained main nile river
in dokki area, giza sterilized autoclaving. pathogens were
inoculated separately autoclaved river water. microcosm sampled
and test microorganisms counted zero (immediately following
inoculation), 1, 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 120 days. physicochemical parameters
including ph, turbidity, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total
dissolved solids, total alkalinity, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen
demand, nitrates nitrites, sulphate, also measured. hadv2, the
highest decay rates observed 37 °c room temperature compared 4 and
-20 °c. similar trend found mnv-1, although unlike hadv2, the
decay rate higher -20 4 °c. also, 4 °c best temperature
for survival mnv-1 (t90 = 76.9 days), e. coli o157:h7 (t90 = 103 days) and
salmonella typhimurium (t90 = 105 days). least survival pathogens,
except mnv-1, recorded 37 °c. results indicate dark
conditions low temperatures, enteric pathogens could stable extended
periods. significant statistical correlation observed the
experimental temperatures infectivity viral particles. study 
provided useful information stability pathogens nile
river water could serve early warning considering water the
river agricultural irrigation household use areas limited no
access potable water.
