a cellular gene double surveillance agent plant combat pathogen.

li b, feng h, zhang q, zhang x, hong y.

the tomato extreme resistance r-gene encodes tm2/ tm22 protein interacts
with tobamovirus movement protein (mp) induce hypersensitive response (hr)
resulting local resistance. r-gene mediated local resistance requires a
functional rbcs interacts mp, restricting virus local infection.
rbcs-mp interaction also required tobamovirus systemic infection.
“loss-of-function” rbcs allows local systemic infection. thus, rbcs, a
cellular gene, acts double surveillance agent protect plant from
pathogenic attack, suggesting previously un-recognized defense strategy in
plants.
