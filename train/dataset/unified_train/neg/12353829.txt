to determine tt virus (ttv) prevalence persistence viremia, we
prospectively cross-sectional longitudinal studies using the
polymerase chain reaction test successive sera 150 japanese
hemodialysis patients compared 166 residents rural
japanese area endemic hepatitis c virus (hcv). ttv dna positivity was
significantly higher 50 (30.1%) residents 25 (16.7%) the
patients 1997 (p < 0.05). ttv dna positively patients not
associated hcv rna positivity also increased number blood
transfusions decreased duration hemodialysis, not
significantly. longitudinal study 1997 1999 showed persistent ttv
dna positivity found significantly often 35 (21.1%) residents 
than 13 (8.6%) patients (p < 0.05), persistent ttv dna
negativity found significantly often 103 (68.7%) patients than
in 91 (54.8%) residents (p < 0.05). 25 patients 50 residents
ttv dna positive 1997, ttv dna eliminated often 12 (48.0%)
patients 15 (30.0%) residents three years, difference
was significant. route ttv transmission might differ hcv 
it could nonparenteral. ttv less prevalent hemodialysis patients than
residents, virus often eliminated hemodialysis patients 
by residents three-year observation period, possibly the
effect hemodialysis procedure.
