the expression patterns three promoters preferentially active roots 
arabidopsis thaliana investigated transgenic potato plants in
response plant parasitic nematode infection. promoter regions three
genes, tub-1, arsk1 rpl16a linked gus reporter gene and
histochemical staining used localize expression potato roots in
response infection potato cyst nematode, globodera pallida and
the root-knot nematode, meloidogyne incognita. three promoters directed gus
expression chiefly root tissue strongly up-regulated galls
induced feeding m. incognita. less activity associated syncytial 
feeding cells cyst nematode, although arsk1 promoter highly active
in syncytia g. pallida infecting soil grown plants. transgenic potato
lines expressed cystatin ocideltad86 control three
promoters evaluated resistance globodera sp. field trial
and m. incognita containment. resistance globodera 70 +/- 4% was
achieved best line using arsk1 promoter associated yield
penalty. highest level partial resistance achieved m. incognita
was 67 +/- 9% using tub-1 promoter. cases comparable 
level resistance achieved using constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s 
(camv35s) promoter. results establish potential limiting transgene
expression crop plants whilst maintaining efficacy nematode defence.
