ribosomal frameshifting retroviral rnas proposed mediated by
slippage two adjacent trnas -1 direction specific
heptanucleotide sequence. report computer-aided analysis the
structure around established putative frameshift sites number of
retroviral, coronaviral, toroviral, luteoviral rnas two dsrna yeast
viruses. almost cases stable hairpin predicted four nine
nucleotides downstream shifty heptanucleotide. half the
resulting hairpin loops give rise potential pseudoknotting sequences
downstream hairpin. especially case shifty heptanucleotides
u uua aac g gga aac, stable downstream pseudoknots present. indications
were also found presence pseudoknots downstream amber stop condons 
at readthrough sites retroviral rnas.
