despite effective treatment chronic hepatitis c, deficiencies diagnosis
and access care preclude disease elimination. screening baby boomers
remains low. aims study assess impact electronic
health record-based prompt hepatitis c virus (hcv) screening rates baby
boomers primary care access specialty care treatment among those
newly diagnosed. implemented electronic health record-based "best practice 
advisory" (bpa) prompted primary care providers perform hcv screening for
patients seen primary care clinic (1) born 1945 1965, (2) who
lacked prior diagnosis hcv infection, (3) lacked prior documented
anti-hcv testing. bpa associated educational materials, order set, and
streamlined access specialty care newly diagnosed patients. pre-bpa and
post-bpa screening rates compared, care newly diagnosed patients 
analyzed. 3 years prior bpa implementation, 52,660 baby boomers were
seen primary care clinics 28% screened. hcv screening increased 
7.6% patients primary care provider visit 6 months prior bpa
to 72% 1 year post-bpa. 53 newly diagnosed patients, were
referred specialty care, 11 advanced fibrosis cirrhosis, 20 started
treatment, 9 achieved sustained virologic response thus far.conclusion:
implementation electronic health record-based prompt increased hcv
screening rates among baby boomers primary care 5-fold due efficiency in
determining needs hcv screening workflow design. streamlined access to
specialty care enabled patients previously undiagnosed advanced disease to
be cured. intervention easily integrated electronic health
record systems increase hcv diagnosis linkage care. (hepatology
