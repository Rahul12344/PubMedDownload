in protection duck virus hepatitis.

background: duck viral hepatitis (dvh) acute disease young ducklings
with convenient effective veterinary drugs treat. pathology,
present study mainly focused immune mechanism, studies have
concerned role oxidative stress pathogenesis dvh. study 
the antioxidative hepatoprotective effects icariin phosphorylated 
derivative dvh, prepared phosphorylated icariin (p-icariin) using 
sodium trimetaphosphate-sodium tripolyphosphate method. ducklings drunk with
icariin p-icariin challenged duck hepatitis virus 1 (dhv-1).
we recorded number dead ducklings, gross pathological changes the
liver, changes indices oxidative stress liver injury. the
correlations indices also analyzed.
results: exposure dhv-1 induced significant oxidative damage ducklings.
administration icariin p-icariin attenuated liver pathological injury and
significantly increased survival rate, better outcomes ducklings
treated p-icariin treated icariin. icariin p-icariin 
also attenuated changes oxidative stress liver injury. found
positive correlations among indices oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and
inducible nitric oxide synthase) liver injury (alanine aminotransferase,
alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase), suggesting dhv-1 causes
significant oxidative damage, related extent hepatic injury.
conclusions: icariin p-icariin improved survival attenuated oxidative
stress liver dysfunction induced dhv-1. outcomes better in
ducklings treated p-icariin treated icariin. clinical
effects components related antioxidant activities.
