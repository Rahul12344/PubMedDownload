molecular characterization c2-v5 envelope sequences maternal plasma,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc), cervical secretions infant pbmc
was performed eight crf01_ae-infected mother/infant pairs. maternal viruses
were relatively homogeneous within compartment distinct different
compartments mothers high cd4 cell counts. infant viruses almost
distinct, phylogenetically related, maternal viruses, mostly the
maternal pbmc compartment, reflecting frequent transmission hiv-1 from
maternal cells rather free viruses.
