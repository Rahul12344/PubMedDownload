four lactococcal abortive infection mechanisms introduced strains which
were sensitive hosts p335 type phages plaque assay experiments performed 
to assess effect five lactococcal bacteriophages family.
results indicate abia inhibits five p335 phages tested, abig
affects phip335 phiq30 p335 species phages. abia was
shown retard phage q30 dna replication previously reported other
phages. also demonstrated abig, previously shown act point
after dna replication cases c2 type 936 type phages, acts the
level of, prior phage q30 dna replication. abie abif effect on
the p335 type phages examined.
