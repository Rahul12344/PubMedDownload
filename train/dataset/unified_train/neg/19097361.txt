present 60-year-old female right-sided third cranial nerve palsy, mild
bitemporal visual field deficit, severe cephalea, polyuria-polydipsia.
hypopituitarism hyperprolactinemia confirmed; brain imaging revealed a
16 mm-diameter sellar mass suprasellar extension. presumptive diagnosis of
pituitary adenoma established. patient underwent neurosurgical
intervention. histopathological examination immunophenotyping (cytokeratin,
cd45+, cd79+, bcl-2-) verified high-grade b-cell non-hodgkin lymphoma the
burkitt type. systemic work-up showed foci lymphoma, patient's
hiv status negative, epstein-barr virus status disclosed. although
ppl undistinguishable pituitary adenoma imaging, one should
consider lymphoma evaluating invasive sellar mass iso- to
hypointense t2-weighted magnetic resonance images, particularly the
patient immunocompromised old presents diabetes insipidus, cranial
nerve palsy fever unknown origin addition expected finding of
