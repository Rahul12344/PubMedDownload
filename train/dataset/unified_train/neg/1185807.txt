when moloney lymphoma (yac) cells freshly explanted tumor-bearing
host culture, two events occurred first 120 minutes: cells lost
their natural igg coat, sensitivity complement-dependent lysis (cdl)
mediated antibodies moloney lymphoma cells decreased increased. an
increasing sensitivity cdl function incubation time 37 degrees c
was likely occur sensitivity cdl low explantation. a
decreasing sensitivity cdl probable instances high sensitivity 
cdl explantation. artifical coating yac cells antibodies moloney
lymphoma immediately explantation moderated alterations their
sensitivity cdl. occurred even though functional antibody not
remain cells evidenced gradual decreased sensitivity 
artifically coated cells addition complement. spent culture media in
which freshly explanted cells grew 60 120 minutes sometimes blocked cdl of
yac cells mediated antibodies moloney lymphoma.
