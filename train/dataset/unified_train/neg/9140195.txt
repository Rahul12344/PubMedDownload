the antigenic genetic characteristics 18 human strains influenza c 
virus isolated yamagata sendai cities, japan january 1991 and
february 1993 investigated. antigenic analysis monoclonal antibodies to
the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein showed isolates could divided
into three distinct groups closely related c/yamagata/26/81, c/aichi/1/81 
c/mississippi/80, respectively. t1-oligonucleotide fingerprinting total vrna
revealed six isolates belonging c/yamagata/26/81 virus group 
the genomes greatly similar one another considerably different 
of 1988/1990 isolates (except c/yamagata/10/89) antigenic group. 
comparison total partial nucleotide sequences seven rna segments 
the three strains (c/miyagi/3/91, c/miyagi/9/91 c/miyagi/2/92) representative
of 1991/1993 strains c/yamagata/26/81 virus group the
previous influenza c isolates obtained humans pigs 1980/1989
showed 1991/1993 strains, like c/yamagata/10/89, closely
related viruses isolated pigs beijing, china 1981/1982 
of isolates humans. observation suggests strongly interspecies
transmission influenza c virus humans pigs occurred nature,
although known whether virus transmitted pigs to
humans humans pigs.
