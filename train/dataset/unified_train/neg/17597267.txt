type 2 bovine viral diarrhea virus (bvdv) become increasingly prevalent
worldwide, currently ratio type 2 type 1 strains usa
approaches 50%. although cross-reactivity bvdv type 1 type 2
strains, bvdv1 vaccine strains poorly protect type 2 infection, vaccines 
against bvdv contain antigens bvdv types. previously we
demonstrated efficacy bvdv1 e2 dna vaccine, study optimized a
bvdv2 e2 dna vaccine. furthermore, approach vaccinate dna vaccine
against bvdv types, compared two strategies, mixing plasmids encoding 
type 1 type 2 e2, co-expression type 1 type 2 e2 one plasmid 
with internal ribosomal entry site (ires). evaluation the
ires-containing plasmids demonstrated c-terminally expressed protein 
produced lower levels induces weaker immune responses the
n-terminally expressed protein, regardless position type 1 type
2 e2 genes. contrast, plasmids encoding type 1 type 2 e2 were
administered mice, immune responses similar induced the
individual plasmids. thus, mixture plasmids encoding type 1 type 2 e2
could potential dna vaccine candidate bvdv1 bvdv2.
