although epstein-barr virus (ebv) bamhi rightward transcript (bart) micrornas
(mirnas) ubiquitously expressed ebv-associated tumors, role most
bart mirnas unclear. study, showed bcl-2-associated death
promoter (bad) expression significantly lower ebv-infected ags-ebv cells
than ebv-negative ags cells investigated whether bart mirnas target bad.
using bioinformatics analysis, five bart mirnas showing seed match 3'
untranslated region (3'-utr) bad selected. these, mir-bart20-5p
reduced bad expression individually transfected ags cells. luciferase
assay revealed mir-bart20-5p directly targets bad. expression bad
mrna protein decreased mir-bart20-5p increased inhibitor 
mir-bart20-5p. pe-annexin v staining cell proliferation assays showed that
mir-bart20-5p reduced apoptosis enhanced cell growth. furthermore,
mir-bart20-5p increased chemoresistance 5-fluorouracil docetaxel. data
suggest mir-bart20-5p contributes tumorigenesis ebv-associated gastric
carcinoma directly targeting 3'-utr bad.
