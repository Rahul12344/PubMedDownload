both chicken egg-white avidin bacterial relative streptavidin well
known extraordinary high affinity biotin (kd approximately 10(-15)
m). widely used tools number affinity-based separations, in
diagnostic assays variety applications. methods have
collectively become known (strept)avidin-biotin technology. biotin easily 
and effectively attached different molecules, termed binders probes,
without destroying biological activity. exceptional stability the
avidin-biotin complex wide range commercially available reagents
explain popularity system. order genetic engineering modify 
the unwanted properties avidin expand existing
avidin-biotin technology, production systems recombinant avidin and
avidin-fusion proteins established. review article presents an
overview current status systems. future trends production 
and applications recombinant avidin avidin-fusion proteins also
discussed.
