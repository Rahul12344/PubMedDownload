suicide cancer gene therapy retroviral vector-producing cells way
of adjuvant surgical resection recurrent glioblastoma, although 
benefit appeared marginal. likely therapeutic approach may 
have better outcomes vectors transgenes delivered efficiently
to tumor cells. shown previously tumor cells engineered by
adenovirus-retrovirus hybrid vectors produce retroviral progeny destroy
satellite tumor cells. whether systemic delivery vector-producing cells
can effectively treat aggressive tumors remains determined. effective
retroviral vector delivery vehicles may multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells 
(mscs), shown home tumor cells vivo deliver
cancer-killing gene immune products minimal host rejection. therefore, it
may possible transduce tumors recombinant progeny vectors delivered by
mscs. may particularly suitable treating diffuse cancers like
glioblastoma multiforme. strategy remains tested various
orthotopic metastatic tumor models, potential greatly improve
the outcome suicide gene therapy.
