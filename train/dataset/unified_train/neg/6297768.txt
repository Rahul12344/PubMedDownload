specific binding glucocorticoid-receptor complex mouse mammary
tumor proviral promoter region.

to elucidate molecular mechanism steroid hormones exert their
regulatory function, investigated interaction glucocorticoid-receptor
complex purified dna fragments cloned mouse mammary tumor (mmtv)
proviral dna. dna-cellulose binding assay, rat mouse glucocorticoid
receptors found interact high affinity site sites near
the promoter region mmtv proviral dna. assay allowed use of
unpurified well purified receptor, therefore made possible to
investigate binding properties mutant receptors. two
nuclear-transfer-deficient receptors decreased affinity specific as
well unspecific dna, still capable distinguishing two
types dna. existence specific dna binding sites steroid-receptor
complexes discussed context general model steroid hormone
action.
