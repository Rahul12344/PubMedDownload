aldh3a1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 3a1) expressed high concentrations the
mammalian cornea believed protects vital tissue the
rest eye uv-light-induced damage. precise biological
function(s) cellular distribution aldh3a1 corneal tissue remain 
be elucidated. among hypotheses proposed aldh3a1 function cornea is
detoxification aldehydes formed uv-induced lipid peroxidation. to
investigate detail biochemical properties distribution protein
in human cornea, expressed human aldh3a1 sf9 insect cells using a
baculovirus vector raised monoclonal antibodies aldh3a1. recombinant 
aldh3a1 protein purified homogeneity single-step affinity
chromatography method using 5'-amp-sepharose 4b. human aldh3a1 demonstrated high 
substrate specificity medium-chain (6 carbons more) saturated and
unsaturated aldehydes, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, generated 
peroxidation cellular lipids. short-chain aliphatic aldehydes, as
acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde malondialdehyde, found poor
substrates human aldh3a1. addition, aldh3a1 metabolized glyceraldehyde
poorly metabolize glucose 6-phosphate, 6-phosphoglucono-delta-lactone
and 6-phosphogluconate all, suggesting enzyme involved in
either glycolysis pentose phosphate pathway. immunohistochemistry human
corneas, using monoclonal antibodies described herein, revealed aldh3a1
expression epithelial cells stromal keratocytes, endothelial
cells. overall, cumulative findings support metabolic function of
aldh3a1 part corneal cellular defence mechanism oxidative
damage caused aldehydic products lipid peroxidation. recombinant human
aldh3a1 highly specific monoclonal antibodies described present
paper may prove useful probing biological functions protein in
ocular tissue.
