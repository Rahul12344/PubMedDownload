the nature immunopathogenic relationship underlying strong
association coeliac disease (cd) hla-dq (a1*0501, b1*0201) genotype 
not known, probably relates binding gluten-derived epitopes the
hla-dq (alpha1*0501, beta1*0201) heterodimer (dq2). epitopes yet
been defined. study tested binding various gluten-derived 
peptides dq2 cellular assay using epstein-barr virus (ebv)-transformed b 
lymphocytes murine fibroblast transfectants. one peptides (peptide
a), previously shown exacerbate cd lesion vitro in
vivo, found bind dq2, albeit moderately, lending credence 
to possible role pathogenesis cd. nature peptide a's binding
to dq2 explored truncated conservative point substituted analogues
and compared published dq2 binding motif, results explain
the observed level binding.
