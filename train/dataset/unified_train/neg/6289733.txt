kidney cells transformed temperature-sensitive mutant rous sarcoma virus 
and chicken embryo fibroblasts infected either temperature-sensitive
mutant wild-type rous sarcoma virus. ribavirin also inhibited replication of
the rous sarcoma viruses chicken embryo fibroblasts. effect ribavirin
on cellular transformation permanent, removal drug resulted
