staphylococcus aureus major cause infection humans animals,
causing wide variety diseases, local inflammations fatal sepsis. the
bacterium commonly multi-drug resistant thus many front-line antibiotics
have rendered ineffective treating infections. research on
murein/peptidoglycan hydrolases, derived bacterial viruses (bacteriophages),
has demonstrated proteins attractive candidates development 
novel antibacterial agents combatting gram-positive pathogens. review
the research produced to-date bacteriophage-derived chapk murein
peptidase. initially, sequenced annotated genome of
anti-staphylococcal bacteriophage k cloned gene bacteriophage
endolysin, murein hydrolase plays role cell killing the
bacteriophage life cycle. highly active domain enzyme, cysteine,
histidine-dependent amido hydrolase/peptidase (chapk), cloned, overexpressed 
in e. coli purified. chapk enzyme demonstrated rapidly lyse
several strains methicillin resistant s. aureus disrupted and
prevented formation staphylococcal biofilm. staphylolytic activity
of peptidase demonstrated vivo using mouse model, without adverse
effects animals. crystal structure enzyme elucidated,
revealing calcium ion close active site. site-directed mutagenesis
indicated calcium ion involved catalytic mechanism the
enzyme. crystal structure enzyme valuable source information 
for efficient engineering similar chap-domain-containing proteins.
overall, data collected date chapk demonstrated strong
potential novel therapeutic candidate treatment staphylococcal
infections provided us insight fundamental enzymatic
mechanisms chap domain-containing peptidoglycan hydrolases.
