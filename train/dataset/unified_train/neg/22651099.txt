the question whether influenza transmitted significant degree by
aerosols remains controversial, part, little known the
quantity size potentially infectious airborne particles produced people
with influenza. study, size amount aerosol particles produced 
by nine subjects coughing measured influenza after
they recovered, using laser aerosol particle spectrometer size range
of 0.35 10 Î¼m. individuals influenza produce significantly greater
volume aerosol ill compared afterward (p = 0.0143). the
patients influenza, average cough aerosol volume 38.3 picoliters
(pl) particles per cough (sd 43.7); patients recovered, average
volume 26.4 pl per cough (sd 45.6). number particles produced per
cough also higher subjects influenza (average 75,400
particles/cough, sd 97,300) compared afterward (average 52,200, sd 98,600), 
although difference reach statistical significance (p = 0.1042). 
average number particles expelled per cough varied widely patient to
patient, ranging 900 302,200 particles/cough subjects influenza
and 1100 308,600 particles/cough recovery. subjects had
influenza, average 63% subject's cough aerosol particle volume in
the detection range respirable size fraction (sd 22%), indicating that
these particles could reach alveolar region lungs inhaled by
another person. enhancement aerosol generation illness may play an
important role influenza transmission suggests better understanding
of phenomenon needed predict production dissemination of
influenza-laden aerosols people infected virus. [supplementary
