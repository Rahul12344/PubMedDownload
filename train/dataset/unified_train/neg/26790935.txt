schmallenberg virus (sbv) emerged across europe 2011 belgium among the
first countries affected. study, published findings combined new
data veterinary surveillance networks belgian reference laboratory
for sbv veterinary agrochemical research centre (coda-cerva) to
reconstruct epidemic belgium. first retrospective cases sbv were
reported veterinarians observed decreased milk yield fever dairy
cattle may 2011. number sbv suspicions subsequently increased adult 
cattle august 2011. month, first sbv positive pools culicoides were
detected extensive virus circulation occurred belgium late summer
and autumn 2011. consequence, pregnant ruminants infected and
their fetuses exposed virus. resulted outbreak abortions,
still-births malformed new-borns observed january april 2012. the
number cases drastically diminished 2012-2013, although multiple lines of
evidence obtained cross-sectional serological surveys, analyses aborted
foetuses, sentinel herd surveillance surveillance sbv vectors prove
that sbv still circulating belgium time. virus circulation was
then probably strongly reduced 2013-2014, increasing evidence indicates 
its recirculation 2014-2015 belgium. based experience gathered 
the closely related akabane virus, recurrent outbreaks congenital events can
be expected long period. vaccination seronegative animals the
first mating could used prevent deleterious effects sbv. this
epidemic, different surveillance approaches including syndromic surveillance,
sentinel herd surveillance, cross-sectional seroprevalence studies pathogen
surveillance vectors proven utility considered to
continue future.
