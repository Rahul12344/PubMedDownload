mri contrast agents providing high relaxivity values obtained through
the attachment multiple gadolinium(iii) complexes interior surfaces 
genome-free viral capsids. previous studies, contrast enhancement was
predicted depend rigidity linker attaching mri agents the
protein surface. test hypothesis, new set gd-hydroxypyridonate based
mri agents prepared attached genetically introduced cysteine residues 
through flexible rigid linkers. greater contrast enhancements seen for
mri agents attached via rigid linkers, validating design concept
and outlining path future improvements nanoscale mri contrast agents.
