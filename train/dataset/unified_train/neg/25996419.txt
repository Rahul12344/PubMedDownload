objectives: investigate effectiveness topical tacrolimus treatment on
herpetic stromal keratitis (hsk) rat model.
methods: development hsk monitored 14 days inoculation
of rats herpes simplex type 1 virus. rats developed hsk divided
into four groups follows: (1) topical antiviral treatment (control), (2)
topical antiviral 1% prednisolone acetate, (3) topical antiviral 0.03%
tacrolimus ointment, (4) topical antiviral plus 0.1% tacrolimus ointment.
after 14 days treatment, severity levels hsk scored compared
with levels treatment. expression cd3, cd4, cd8 was
evaluated flow cytometry. development disease evaluated
clinically histologically.
results: significant improvement vascularization observed groups
with drug treatment addition antiviral agent (p<0.05), there
was obvious difference within groups 2, 3, 4 vascularization
severity. regression corneal edema 8.05%±6% group 1, 25.17%±14.55% 
in group 2 (p=0.01), 36.40%±21.69% group 3 (p=0.03), 46.39%±14.96% in
group 4 (p=0.00). significant decrease number inflammatory cells in
the groups drug treatment evaluated immunohistochemical staining 
and confirmed flow cytometry analysis.
conclusions: topical tacrolimus treatment caused significant decrease in
corneal vascularization accompanied lower number inflammatory cells in
the experimental hsk corneal edema model. therefore, topical tacrolimus the
potential used treatment hsk.
