plant viruses: tool-box genetic engineering crop protection.

wilson tm.

traditionally, plant viruses viewed harmful, undesirable pathogens.
however, genomes provide several useful 'designer functions' or
'sequence modules' tailor future gene vectors plant general 
biotechnology. majority (77%) known plant viruses single-stranded rna
of messenger (protein coding) sense genetic material. past 
4 years, improved vitro transcription systems construction partial 
or full-length dna copies several plant rna viruses enhanced ability 
to manipulate study genomes, particularly context their
pathogenic interactions host plants. recently, two forms genetically
engineered protection plant virus infections reported. both,
a virus-related 'interfering' molecule stably introduced plants via 
dna-transfer mechanism agrobacterium tumefaciens. date, choice of
'interfering' molecule guided empirical field-observations each
is effective narrow range closely-related viruses. yet, we
do fully understand molecular mechanism(s) responsible observed
protection. ability manipulate plant-pathogen relationship a
powerful tool increase knowledge improve future strategies for
unconventional cropprotection genetic engineering techniques.
