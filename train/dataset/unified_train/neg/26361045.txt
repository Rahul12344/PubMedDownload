backgroud: programmed cell death-ligand 1 (pd-l1) driver mutations are
commonly seen non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc). however, prevelance of
pd-l1 over-expression prognostic value epstein-barr virus (ebv)
associated pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (lelc) remains poorly
understood.
methods: total 214 nsclc patients 113 surgically treated pulmonary lelc 
patients included. paraffin-embedded tumor sections stained pd-l1 
antibody. correlations pd-l1 expression clinicopathological features 
as well survival outcomes analyzed.
results: frequency pd-l1 over-expression nsclc 51.4%. no
significant association observed common driver mutations pd-l1
over-expression. remakably, positive rate pd-l1 pulmonary lelc was
74.3%. high pd-l1 expression associated impaired disease-free survival
(dfs) compared low pd-l1 expression (p = 0.008). multivariate analysis shows
that pd-l1 expression level, n stage stage independent prognostic
factors dfs. n stage stage pd-l1 expression level were
significantly associated overall survival (os).
conclusions: pd-l1 over-expression related common driver mutations 
nsclc. pulmonary lelc remarkably high incidence pd-l1 expression. pd-l1
was negative prognostic factor dfs surgically resected pulmonary lelc.
these findings may provide rationale immunotarget therapy this
virus-associated lung cancer.
