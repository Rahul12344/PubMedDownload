background: "protein-trap" method allows epitope-tagging endogenous 
proteins. method allows identification endogenously expressed
proteins exhibit specific localization interest. method been
recently reported application study drosophila development by
using relatively large epitope, green-fluorescent-protein (gfp).
result: herein, report new "protein-trap" vector mammalian cells. this
new method utilizes much smaller epitope-tag also allows drug-selection
prior epitope-tagging. pre-selection drug resulted highly
efficient protein-trapping frequency.
conclusion: "protein-trap" method based new vector expected to
serve complimentary approach previously reported gfp-based method.
