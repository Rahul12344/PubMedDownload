a growing number arenaviruses known cause viral hemorrhagic fever (hf),
a severe life-threatening syndrome characterized fever, malaise, and
increased vascular permeability. ribavirin, licensed antiviral indicated
for treatment certain arenaviral hfs, mixed success and
significant toxicity. since severe arenaviral infections initially present
with distinguishing symptoms difficult clinically diagnose early
stages, utmost importance identify antiviral therapies effective at
later stages infection. previously reported t-705, substituted 
pyrazine derivative currently development anti-influenza drug, is
highly active hamsters infected pichinde virus drug is
administered orally early course infection. demonstrate
that t-705 offers significant protection lethal arenaviral infection
in hamsters treatment begun animals ill day 
the animals begin succumb disease. importantly, coincides the
time peak viral loads present organs considerable tissue
damage evident. also show t-705 effective as, less toxic
than, ribavirin, infected t-705-treated hamsters average maintain their
weight better recover rapidly animals treated ribavirin.
further, added benefit combination therapy t-705 and
ribavirin. finally, pharmacokinetic data indicate plasma t-705 levels
following oral administration markedly reduced latter stages of
disease, may contribute reduced efficacy seen treatment is
withheld day 7 infection. findings support pre-clinical
development t-705 treatment severe arenaviral infections.
