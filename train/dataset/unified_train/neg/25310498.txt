several studies shown type 1 interferons (ifns) exert multiple
biological effects innate adaptive immune responses. here, we
investigated pathogenicity immunogenicity recombinant rabies virus
(rabv) expressing canine interferon α1 (rhep-caifnα1). shown kun ming
(km) mice received single intramuscular immunization rhep-caifnα1 had
an earlier increase higher level virus-neutralizing antibody titers
compared immunization parent hep-flury. challenge experiment
further confirmed mice immunized rhep-caifnα1 survived
compared mice immunized parent virus. quantitative real-time pcr
indicated rhep-caifnα1 induced stronger innate immune response, especially
the type 1 ifn response. flow cytometry conducted show rhep-caifnα1
recruited activated b cells lymph nodes cd8 cells peripheral
blood, beneficial achieve virus clearance early infective
stage.
