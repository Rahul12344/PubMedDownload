direct-acting antivirals (daas) demonstrated high efficacy safety even the
post-liver transplant (lt) setting hiv-infected patients, data are
very limited early post-lt period recently available daa.
two hiv/hcv-coinfected lt recipients (both grafts hiv/hcv-negative donors)
experienced early hcv recurrence severe hepatitis treated with
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 12 weeks. unfortunately, patients failed: one
(genotype 4d) showed virological breakthrough week 3 with
resistance-associated substitutions (rass) ns5a ns5b, the
other (genotype 1a) experienced virological relapse without ras. progressed 
to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis successfully retreated with
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 16 weeks achieving sustained virological response.
the higher prevalence ras experienced genotype 4 patients long time
to viral suppression observed subjects fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis
should taken account, considering longer treatment duration increase
the chances achieving sustained virological response.
