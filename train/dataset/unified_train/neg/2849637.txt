the vector competence geographic strains aedes albopictus ae.
polynesiensis fiji strains ae. pseudoscutellaris ae. aegypti was
assessed ross river (rr) virus, etiologic agent epidemic
polyarthritis. strains ae. polynesiensis fiji, rarotonga, somoa and
tahiti susceptible infection per os (mid50 less equal to
10(1.2) vero cell plaque-forming units [pfu]/blood meal). virus transmission data
were variable, strains except one fiji transmitted virus 14
to 21 days postinfection. shanghai hawaii ae. albopictus fiji ae.
pseudoscutellaris also highly susceptible per os infection rr virus 
(mid50 10(2.0) 10(2.6) pfu). singapore sri lanka ae. albopictus fiji
ae. aegypti least susceptible (mid50 10(4.0) 10(4.2) pfu). one
exception, virus transmission rates ae. pseudoscutellaris ae. aegypti and
the four strains ae. albopictus ranged 52 100%. total 4,718
third- fourth-instar larvae second gonotrophic cycle potentially 
infected females tested rr virus 39 pools. infection rates in
parental females ranged 87 100% ae. albopictus, ae. pseudoscutellaris 
and ae. polynesiensis 40 48% ae. aegypti. virus isolated from
