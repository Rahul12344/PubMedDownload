the history north african jewish community ancient complicated with
a number immigration waves persecutions dramatically affecting its
population size. decade-long process israel clinical-molecular screening 
of north african jews incurable autosomal recessive blindness led the
identification homozygous splicing mutation (c.95-2a > t; ivs2-2a > t) in
rpe65, gene encoding isomerase catalyzes key step the
retinoid-visual cycle, patients 10 unrelated families. total 33
patients (four deceased) severe childhood blindness known leber
congenital amaurosis (lca), making common cause retinal
degeneration population. haplotype analysis seven patients
revealed shared homozygous region, indicating population-specific founder
mutation. age rpe65 founder mutation estimated emerged
100-230 (mean, 153) generations ago, suggesting originated the
establishment jewish community north africa. individuals this
rpe65 mutation characterized retinal studies determine 
candidates gene replacement, recent therapy date this
otherwise incurable blindness. step molecular anthropological studies to
application genetic medicine taken, representative this
patient subgroup treated subretinal raav2-rpe65 gene therapy. an
increase vision present treated area early 15 days 
intervention. process genetically analyzing affected isolated populations
as screen gene-based therapy suggests new paradigm disease diagnosis 
and treatment.
