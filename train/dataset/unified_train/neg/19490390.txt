abstract white spot syndrome virus (wssv), taura syndrome virus (tsv) and
infectious hypodermal haematopoietic necrosis virus (ihhnv) been
responsible major pandemics affecting shrimp farming industry. shrimp
samples collected eight farms hainan province, china, 2007
and analysed polymerase chain reaction (pcr) reverse transcriptase pcr
methods determine prevalence viruses. eight sampling
locations, samples one farm show indication infection
with wssv, tsv ihhnv, samples one additional farm exhibited
evidence infection tsv only. surprisingly, evidence co-infection 
tsv ihhnv found among samples two farms evidence co-infection
with three viruses (wssv, tsv ihhnv) detected among shrimp samples at
four farms. elucidate molecular characteristics wssv china, 
we analysed genomic features wssv isolates based orf23/24
variable region. data, identified two novel wssv strains which
contain nucleotide deletions 5657 11093 bp, respectively, compared
with largest wssv-tw isolate.
