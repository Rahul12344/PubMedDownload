nocardia spp. worldwide, ubiquitous zoonotic bacteria ability
to infect humans well domestic animals. herein, present case a
five-year-old female spayed domestic shorthair cat (from island nevis)
with history traumatic skin wound ventral abdomen approximately two
years prior presenting ross university veterinary clinic. cat
presented severe dermatitis cellulitis ventral caudal abdomen,
with multiple draining tracts sinuses exuding purulent material. initial
bacterial culture yielded corynebacterum spp. patient treated
symptomatically antibiotics 8 weeks. cat re-presented 8 weeks 
the initial visit worsening abdominal lesions. surgical intervention 
occurred time, histopathology tissue cultures confirmed the
presence nocardia spp.-induced pyogranulomatous panniculitis, dermatitis, 
cellulitis. pre-operatively, patient found feline immunodeficiency 
virus (fiv)-positive. patient administered trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(tms) antimicrobial sensitivity testing. pcr amplification 16s rrna
gene sequencing confirmed nocardia jiangxiensis causative agent. our
knowledge, n. jiangxiensis previously associated disease. 
case report aims highlight importance much-needed one health approach
using advancements technology better understand zoonotic potential of
nocardia spp. worldwide.
