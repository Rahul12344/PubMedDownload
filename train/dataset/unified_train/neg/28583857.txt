antibodies specific rift valley fever virus (rvfv) detected diverse
methods, including ezyme-linked immunosortbent assay (elisa) virus
neutralization test (vnt). vnt superior sensitivity specificity and
is therefore considered gold standard serological assay. classical vnts make 
use virulent rvfv therefore performed biosafety level 3
laboratories. here, report development novel vnt based 
avirulent rvfv expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp), which
can performed safely outside level 3 biocontainment facilities. evaluation
with broad panel experimental sera field sera demonstrated this
novel vnt faster sensitive classical vnt.
