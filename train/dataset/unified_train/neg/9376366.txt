a number positively charged polypeptides proteins bundle dna, f-actin,
microtubules, viruses filamentous phage fd tobacco mosaic virus
(tmv), well intermediate filaments formed vimentin. general behavior
is dictated common polyelectrolyte nature biopolymers, which
gives rise nonspecific binding ligands carrying several net opposite
charges. attractive interaction accounts subsequent lateral
aggregation, distinguishing transition liquid crystalline formation
of filamentous particles high concentrations. morphologically similar filament
bundles also induced inert solutes polyethylene glycol (peg)
and proteins bind macromolecular filaments, the
physicochemistry underlying class bundle transitions distinct. in
particular, bundling transitions induced electrostatic steric mechanisms
have opposite dependence solution ionic strength concentration 
of filamentous biopolymers. distinct mechanisms illustrated this
report may contribute formation specific polymer bundles under
physiological conditions.
