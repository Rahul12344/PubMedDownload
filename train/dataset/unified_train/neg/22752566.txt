serial, high multiplicity passage equine herpesvirus 1 (ehv-1) leads the
generation defective interfering particles (dip). ehv-1 dip inhibit and
interfere replication standard ehv-1, establishing state of
persistent infection. dip package severely truncated rearranged forms
of standard viral genome. contained within dip genome three
genes: ul3, ul4, unique hybrid gene (hyb). hybrid gene forms 
recombination event fuses portions early regulatory ir4 ul5 genes
and essential dip-mediated interference. ul4 gene early gene
dispensable lytic replication inhibits viral cellular gene
expression. however, contribution ul4 gene dip-mediated
persistent infection unknown. here, describe generation completely
deleted ul4 virus use investigate role ul4 gene the
generation defective genome. deletion ul4 gene resulted delayed 
virus growth late times post-infection. cells infected mutant ehv-1
that lacked expression ul4 protein due inserted stop codon the
ul4 gene produced defective particles, cells infected mutant ehv-1
that complete ul4 gene sequence deleted unable produce dip. these
data suggest ul4 gene sequence, ul4 protein, critical for
the generation defective interfering particles.
