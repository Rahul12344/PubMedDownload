identification broadly neutralizing antibodies (nabs) generated the
course hiv-1 infection essential effective hiv-1 vaccine design. the
magnitude breadth neutralizing activity sera 46 antiretroviral
treatment-naive hiv-1 clade c-infected individuals measured single round
infection assay using tzm-bl cells multisubtype panel env-pseudotyped
viruses. higher levels nab response (nab titer 500 >40 000) measured
in patients tier 1 tier 2 viruses. average magnitude the
nab responses chronically infected individuals heterologous viruses
was consistently higher response observed individuals with
long-term nonprogressor ( p = .086). conclude, high titers hiv-1
cross-neutralizing activity observed sera subset of
hiv-1-infected individuals chennai, india. additional studies epitopes 
recognized antibodies may facilitate discovery effective
vaccine immunogen.
