optimal enhancement hybridization signal developed detection
of porcine circovirus (pcv) 2 formalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded tissues
from pigs postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. hybridization
signal obtained thermocycler pretreatment uniform across the
section, whereas signal obtained either proteinase k microwave
pretreatment weaker variable intensity across sections.
thermocycler pretreatment combined brief proteinase k digestion enhance 
signal detection target viral nucleic acid formalin-fixed,
paraffin-wax-embedded tissues. strong hybridization signal detected 
cytoplasm macrophages multinucleated giant cells lymph node spleen 
without background staining morphological damage. technical improvement
results, therefore, identical background time increased
signal and, thus, may help detect lower levels pcv2 dna formalin-fixed,
paraffin-wax-embedded tissues.
