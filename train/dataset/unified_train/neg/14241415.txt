tumor virus antigens simian virus 40: differential inhibition synthesis
by cytosine arabinoside.

rapp f, melnick jl, kitahara t.

cells infected papovavirus sv40 synthesize viral antigen but
also synthesize specific nonviral antigen found sv40-induced tumors. in
the presence dna antagonist cytosine arabinoside, infected cells fail to
make viral antigen still synthesize tumor antigen. iododeoxyuridine 
not inhibit synthesis either tumor virus antigen prevent
the development infectious virus.
