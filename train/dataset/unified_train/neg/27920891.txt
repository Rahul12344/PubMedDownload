magnetic separation versatile technique used sample preparation for
diagnostic purpose. application, external magnetic field applied
to drive separation target entity (e.g. bacteria, viruses, parasites and
cancer cells) complex raw sample order ease subsequent task(s)
for disease diagnosis. separation process achieved via the
utilization high magnetic field gradient, also, cases, low
magnetic field gradient magnitude less 100 m-1 equally feasible.
it aim review paper summarize usage high gradient
magnetic separation low gradient magnetic separation (lgms) techniques in
this area research. noteworthy effectiveness magnetic
separation process determines outcome diagnosis also
directly influences accuracy well sensing time involved. therefore,
understanding factors simultaneously influence efficiency both
magnetic separation process target detection necessary. moreover, for
lgms, several important considerations taken into
account order ensure successful implementation. hence, review
paper aims provide overview relate crucial information by
linking magnetic separation theory biomedical diagnostic applications.
