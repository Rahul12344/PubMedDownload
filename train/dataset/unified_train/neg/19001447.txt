background: cd4+ cell recovery dynamics analysed 'on treatment'
periods structured therapy interruption (sti) well long-term immune 
reconstitution highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart) finishing 
sti.
methods: one hundred twenty hiv-1-infected patients successful haart 
randomized receive 2 years continuous haart (n=37) two different
strategies sti (n=83). period, patients received continuous
haart 2 years.
results: sti period, rate recovery cd4+ cells decreased
progressively first last resumption haart {median change of
increase: +232 [interquartile range (iqr): +126, +318], +116 (iqr: +10, +471),
+87 (iqr: -54, +252) -26 (iqr: -352, +211) cells/mm3 first, second,
third fourth resumption, respectively}. sti period 2 years of
continuous haart, median cd4+ count remained significantly lower at
baseline sti arms, virological arm [559 (iqr: 383, 727) versus 771
(iqr: 625, 913) cells/mm3, p<0.0001] immunological arm [619 (iqr: 501,
789) versus 787 (iqr: 657, 954) cells/mm3, p<0.0001], control arm 
[886 (iqr: 564, 1122) versus 780 (iqr: 539, 945) cells/mm3, p=0.68]. a
multivariate analysis, nadir cd4+ cells baseline value cd4+
before sti period independently predicted level cd4+ cells 2 years
after resumption haart (in cases, p<0.0001).
conclusion: drop cd4+ cell count first second period 3
months interruption haart completely recovered resuming haart;
conversely, interruptions longer 6 months deleterious recovery 
of cd4+. cd4+ cell count rebound completely patients received 2
years haart 2 years stis.
