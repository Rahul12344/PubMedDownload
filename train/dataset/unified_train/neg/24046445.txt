mrfa, transcription factor regulates dictyostelium prestalk cell
differentiation, orthologue metazoan myelin gene regulatory factor
(mrf) proteins. show mrfs contain predicted transmembrane domain,
suggesting synthesised membrane-tethered proteins 
proteolytically released. confirm mrfa report radically
different mode processing paradigmatic tethered transcriptional
regulators, cleaved within transmembrane domain dedicated
protease. instead, auto-proteolytic cleavage mechanism, previously only
described intramolecular chaperone domains bacteriophage tail-spike
proteins, processes mrfa and, implication, metazoan mrf proteins. also 
present evidence auto-proteolysis mrfa occurs rapidly and
constitutively er specific role prestalk cell
differentiation conferred regulated nuclear translocation the
liberated fragment.
