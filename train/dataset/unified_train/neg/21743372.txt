purpose: better characterize unusual blepharoptosis observed in
hiv-positive patients evaluate histopathology.
methods: retrospective case series evaluated patients hiv/aids and
blepharoptosis reduced levator excursion. exclusion criteria included
patients identifiable causes ptosis (e.g., aponeurotic dehiscences, prior
eyelid trauma surgery), known myopathic/neuropathic systemic disorders,
congenital ptosis, cranial neuropathies, systemic infiltrative processes.
results: 10 patients bilateral symptomatic blepharoptosis. patients
(100%) men mean age presentation 54 years (range, 42-77 years).
mean duration hiv infection among 7 10 patients 19 years (range, 13-24 
years). mean (±sd) mrd1 0.7 (±0.8) od 0.6 (±0.8) os. mean (±sd) levator
excursion 12 (±2.3) od 13 (±1.8) os (normal levator excursion >15 mm). no
patient taking zidovudine (azt) time presentation. nine patients
(90%) underwent large bilateral levator resections correction of
blepharoptosis. histopathologic specimens revealed abnormal levator muscle fibers
with various degrees atrophy, fibrosis, regeneration without inflammation.
conclusions: hiv-associated blepharoptosis observed among patients this
study consistent myopathy. levator muscle histopathologic findings
are virtually identical muscle biopsies individuals hiv-associated
myopathy, described advent azt highly active antiretroviral
therapy (haart). surgical management levator resection provides optimal
correction hiv-associated blepharoptosis.
