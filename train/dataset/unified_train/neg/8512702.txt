in paper, used technique known sphere-linked immunodiagnostic
assay (slida) detection antibodies hiv-1 p25/24 gp120 proteins.
in technique, p25/24 gp120 proteins covalently bonded 0.5
micron carboxylated microspheres. exposed serial dilutions of
rabbit antiserum hiv-1 p25/24, sheep antiserum gp120 dilutions the
corresponding normal sera. specific immunolabeling monitored using
gold-labeled secondary antibody. gold particles bound microspheres
were indication presence specific antibody serum sample. the
gold-labeled microspheres photographed using transmission electron
microscope, number gold particles bound microspheres were
counted manually using electron micrographs. specificity sensitivity 
of technique compared enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) 
and western blotting.
