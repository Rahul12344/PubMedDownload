background: moloney murine leukemia virus (mo-mlv) proven valuable for
studies pathogenesis malignant lymphoma. inoculation newborn mice
induces cell lymphoma 100% incidence. tll (t cell
lymphoma/leukemia)-strain previously established shown to
spontaneously develop cell lymphoma high frequency.
materials methods: differential screening cdna libraries performed 
discover involvement mo-mlv genomic sequencing used identify the
chromosomal position mo-ml v proviral integration sites. immunophenotypes of
the tumors established flow cytometty. disease frequency curves were
created according kaplan-meier method.
results: two independent mo-mlv germ line integrations characterized on
chromosomes 2 14, giving rise two substrains mice denoted tll-2 and
tll-14. chromosomal position integrated provirus affected the
frequency disease, well immunophenotype tumors.
conclusion: data suggest factors influencing transcriptional
activity chromosomal regions, leading differences proviral
expression, could underlie observed difference tumor frequency.
