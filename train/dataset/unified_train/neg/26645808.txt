point mutations h274y n294s lead resistance influenza virus strains
to drug molecules. recently, large number experiments focused on
the many frameworks catalytic residues thought prevent efficacy of
anti-flu drugs. past, research considered role drugs in
rigid proteins rather flexible proteins. study, used molecular
dynamics simulation (md) combined structure- ligand-based drug design
(sbdd lbdd) methods study dynamic interaction protein dynamics
correlation statistics compounds framework catalytic
residues influenza virus n1 strains. drug candidates screened using the
ic50 docking result predicted support vector machine, multiple linear
regression, genetic function approximation (p < 0.001). shown md,
saussureamine c diiodotyrosine protein dynamics correlation similar to
that sialic acid, participate hydrogen bond formation with
loop, framework, catalytic residues. silico findings suggest that
saussureamine c inhibit h274y n294s mutants, diiodotyrosine 
also inhibit n294s mutants. therefore, drugs saussureamine c and
diiodotyrosine potential produce inhibitory effects wild-type
influenza virus n1 mutants.
