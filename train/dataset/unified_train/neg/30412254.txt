genetic selection inexpensive complementary strategy traditional
methods improving animal health welfare. nonetheless, endeavors to
incorporate animal health welfare traits international breeding programs
have hampered availability informative phenotypes. recent
eradication program bovine viral diarrhea (bvd) republic ireland
has provided opportunity quantify potential benefits genetic
selection could offer bvd eradication programs elsewhere, well inform
possible eradication programs diseases republic ireland.
using dataset 188,085 irish calves, estimated direct maternal
heritability estimates birth persistently infected calves following
likely utero exposure bvd virus ranged different zero (linear
model) 0.29 (se = 0.075; threshold model) essentially zero (linear
model) 0.04 (se = 0.033; threshold model), respectively. corresponding
genetic sd direct maternal effect binary trait (0, 1) ranged
from 0.005 (linear model) 0.56 (threshold model) units ranged 0.00008
(linear model) 0.20 (threshold model) units, respectively. coefficient 
direct genetic variation based linear model 2.56% indicating
considerable genetic variation could exploited. based results the
linear model present study, potential reduce incidence
of persistent infection cattle average 0.11 percentage units per year
which cumulative permanent. therefore, genetic selection contribute to
reducing incidence persistent infection cattle. moreover, where
populations free persistent infection, inclusion estimated
genetic merit bvd national breeding indexes could contribute a
preservation bvd-free status. results present study used 
inform breeding programs potential genetic gains achievable. moreover, the
approaches used present study applied diseases data
become available.
