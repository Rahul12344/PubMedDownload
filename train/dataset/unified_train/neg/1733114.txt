nucleotide sequences determined rna segments coding proteins
other hemagglutinin neuraminidase a/leningrad/134/57 (h2n2)
wild-type (a/len/wt) virus two cold-adapted (ca) attenuated variants,
a/leningrad/134/17/57 (a/len/17/ca) a/leningrad/134/47/57 (a/len/47/ca) 
are used u.s.s.r. preparation reassortant live attenuated
vaccines. ten nucleotide differences detected sequences the
a/len/wt a/len/17/ca viruses; these, eight deduced encode amino
acid (aa) substitutions. one aa substitution predicted pb2, m1, 
m2, ns2 proteins, whereas two aa substitutions predicted the
pb1, pa proteins a/len/17/ca virus. four additional nucleotide changes
were found genome a/len/47/ca virus; three detected
to code one additional aa substitution pb2, pb1, np
proteins.
