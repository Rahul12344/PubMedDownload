baseline data health free-ranging wildlife essential evaluate impacts
of habitat transformation wildlife translocation, rehabilitation, and
reintroduction programs. health information many species, especially great
apes, extremely limited. 1996 1998, 84 free-ranging orangutans
captured translocation, underwent complete health evaluation. analogous
data gathered 60 semi-captive orangutans malaysia. baseline
hematology serology; vitamin, mineral pesticide levels; results of
health evaluations, including physical examination, provide baseline future
monitoring. free-ranging semi-captive orangutans shared exposure 11 47 
viruses. semi-captive orangutans significantly higher prevalence of
antibodies adenovirus (p < 0.0005) rota (sa 11) virus (p < 0.008). more
free-ranging semi-captive animals antibodies japanese encephalitis
virus (p < 0.08) foamy virus (p = 0.05). exposure parainfluenza langat
viruses detected exclusively semi-captive animals exposure sinbis
virus found free-ranging orangutans. evidence exposure
to respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie virus, dengue virus, zika virus 
both groups. ebstein-barr virus ubiquitous groups. prevalence of
antibodies mumps virus changed 0% 1996 45% 1998. no
antibodies detected many important zoonotic viral pathogens, including
herpesvirus hepatitis virus. prevalence balantidium coli plasmodium
pitheci infections exposure mycobacterium higher semi-captive
animals. differences exposure pathogens groups may due to
environmental factors including differences exposures species,
habitat quality, nutritional status, potential stressors. differences
in health parameters captive free-ranging orangutans need be
considered planning conservation areas, translocation procedures, and
rehabilitation protocols. survival orangutan linked animal
and ecosystem health, results study assist wildlife conservation
programs providing baseline health information.
