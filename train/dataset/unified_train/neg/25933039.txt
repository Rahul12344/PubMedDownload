cytotoxic lymphocytes (ctls) important agents control of
intracellular pathogens, specifically recognize kill infected cells.
recently developed experimental methods allow estimation ctl's
efficacy detecting clearing infected host cells. one method, vivo
killing assay, utilizes adoptive transfer antigen displaying target cells 
into bloodstream mice. surprisingly, killing efficacies measured this
method often much higher estimates obtained methods based on,
for instance, dynamics escape mutations. study, investigated
what fraction variation explained differences peptide loads 
employed vivo killing assays. addressed question mice immunized 
with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (lcmv). conducted vivo killing
assays varying loads immunodominant epitope gp33 target cells.
using mathematical model, determined efficacy effector memory
ctl, well ctl chronically infected mice. found killing
efficacy substantially reduced lower peptide loads. physiological
peptide loads, analysis predicts factor 10 lower ctl efficacies
than maximum peptide loads. assuming efficacy scales linearly with
the frequency ctl, clear hierarchy emerges among groups across all
peptide antigen concentrations. group mice chronic lcmv infections
shows consistently higher killing efficacy per ctl acutely infected
mouse group, turn consistently larger efficacy memory
mouse group. conclude ctl killing efficacy dependence surface epitope 
frequencies partially explain variation vivo killing efficacy 
estimates across experimental methods viral systems, vary four
orders magnitude. contrast, peptide load differences explain most
two orders magnitude.
