combination oncolytic virotherapy immunomodulators emerging a
promising therapeutic strategy numerous tumor entities. study, we
developed measles schwarz vaccine strain vectors encoding immunomodulators to
support different phases establishment antitumor immune responses.
therapeutic efficacy novel vectors evaluated immunocompetent
mc38cea tumor model. identified vectors encoding il-12 fusion protein
(mevac fmil-12) antibody pd-l1 (mevac anti-pd-l1), respectively,
as effective. treatment established tumors mevac fmil-12
achieved 90% complete remissions. profiling tumor immune microenvironment 
revealed activation type 1 helper cell-directed response, mevac
fmil-12 ensuring potent early natural killer effector cell activation as
well upregulation effector cytokines ifn-γ tnf-α. cd8+ cells were
found essential therapeutic efficacy mevac fmil-12. results of
this study present mevac fmil-12 novel approach targeted il-12 delivery 
and elucidate mechanisms successful immunovirotherapy.
