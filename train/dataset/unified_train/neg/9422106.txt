matrix hcv, newly developed semiautomated assay detection antibodies
against individual antigens hepatitis c virus, evaluated blood
donor specimens compared results another recombinant immuno-blot 
assay. 399 samples derived low-prevalence population revealed assay
specificity 99.2% matrix hcv. investigation 133 samples repeat
reactive screening results showed matrix hcv assay higher ability 
to discriminate clear reactive nonreactive result compared the
recombinant immuno-blot assay.
