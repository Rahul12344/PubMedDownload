the effects specific antibodies chronic echovirus type 5 (echo 5)
encephalitis investigated patient x-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
virus detected cerebrospinal fluid (csf) blood despite treatment 
commercial human gammaglobulin contained low titers antibodies echo 5 
(0.6 x 10(4) units per injection). virus disappeared blood csf when
plasma containing high concentrations antibodies (total dose, 1--4 x 10(4)
units/kg) administered intravenously. maximal inhibition virus was
achieved culture patient's csf titer antibody echo 5
in csf greater equal 16 units/ml. although patient died,
hyperimmune plasma improved neurologic status eliminated detectable virus
from blood csf.
