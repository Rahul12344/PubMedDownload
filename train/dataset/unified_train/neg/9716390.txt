several drug-resistant strains herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) isolated 
vivo tissue culture, exhibited mutated thymidine kinase (tk).
moreover, various site-directed-mutagenesis experiments conducted hsv1 tk
allowed assignment specific amino acid residues specific functional
properties. this, range hypotheses generated related substrate
binding tk molecular level. site-directed-mutagenesis study q125
was performed clarify contribution residue binding of
thymidine aciclovir beyond hydrogen-bonding pattern observed the
crystal structure. q125l able phosphorylate thymidine, q125n
accepts thymidine aciclovir substrates. q125e shows phosphorylation
activity. several mutations identified previously relevant drug resistance 
were studied attempt understand role processes.
four amino acid positions described (t63, a168, r176 c336) confer
drug resistance mutated; however, molecular mechanisms considerably 
different case. analysis crystal structures molecular
modeling presented paper suggest t63 essential binding of
mg2+ thus catalytic activity enzyme, a168 limits steric
accessibility mutated bulkier residue exclude binding larger 
substrate analogues. r176 appears essential electrostatic balance
within active site, c336, located surface tk and
directed toward atp-binding site, disrupts three-dimensional structure of
the whole active site shifting lid-domain. present work contributes to
a detailed understanding nucleoside binding tk, thereby facilitating the
rational design substrates hsv1 tk drug-specific tk gene
therapy.
