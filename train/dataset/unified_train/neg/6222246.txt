the products gene related phages mu d108 differ their
specificities.

toussaint a, faelen m, desmet l, allet b.

by recombination different mutants mutator phages mu d108, we
isolated set viable hybrids. structure hybrids analyzed by
digestion different restriction enzymes. genetic studies show hybrids
which carry left end mu genome complement mini-mu deleted from
within gene well mu hybrids left end d108
genome d108 not. vice versa, hybrids left end d108 genome
or d108, hybrids left end mu genome mu complement a
mini-d108 deleted within gene. nucleotide sequence gene
of mu equivalent d108 mainly similar except left end.
these observations demonstrate two pa products, although partially 
different, different specificities.
