antiproteases play diverse roles nature, regulating protease activity 
innate defense microorganisms. recently, antiproteases shown to
play important roles hiv pathogenesis including, inhibiting hiv binding and
replication reducing activation inflammation susceptible cells. they
have also implicated one initial host responders, plasma, to
control replication hiv. recently, antiproteases expressed mucosal
surface linked reduced susceptibility hiv infection in
hiv-exposed sero-negative individuals. factors expressed the
epithelial layer female genital tract, thus frontline defense
against mucosal infection. review focuses specific antimicrobial
roles antiproteases, focusing serpins cystatins, emphasis on
their known potential roles hiv infection. potential therapeutic 
interventions combat hiv also discussed.
