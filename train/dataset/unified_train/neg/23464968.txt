human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) carriers rarely subject to
inflammatory disorders multiple organs, well-known
complication, adult t-cell leukemia/lymphoma (atll). htlv-1 associated
bronchiolo-alveolar disorder (haba) proposed immune mediated
pulmonary reaction seen rarely htlv-1 carriers. reported
clinico-pathological patterns haba diffuse panbronchiolitis (dpb) and
lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (lip). report three cases htlv-1
carriers showing miliary micro-nodules throughout lungs. microscopic
examination video assisted thoracic surgery biopsies demonstrated all
cases multiple discrete micro-nodules consisted marked lymphoid
infiltration, granulomas, eosinophils foci necrosis inside the
granuloma. findings indicating atll, neoplastic conditions, infection or
interstitial pneumonia, including dpb lip, present following panels of
special staining immunohistochemical examinations. two patients improved
without treatment within one month, evidence recurrence 7 years.
one patient showed slow deterioration lung reticular shadows spite low
dose corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone 10 mg/day). believe cases may 
be newly recognized variant haba.
