elisa situ used titrate hepatitis virus (hav) particles and
real-time polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) shown fast method
to quantify hav genome. precise quantification viral concentration is
necessary distinguish infectious non-infectious particles. the
purpose study compare cell culture rt-pcr quantification
results determine whether hav genome quantification correlated with
infectivity. purpose, three stocks undiluted, five-fold diluted and
10-fold diluted hav prepared inoculate cells 96-well plate.
monolayers incubated seven, 10 14 days correlation
between elisa situ rt-pcr results evaluated. 10 days
post-incubation, highest viral load observed stocks hav via
rt-pcr (10(5) copies/ml) (p = 0.0002), elisa revealed highest quantity 
of particles 14 days (optical density = 0.24, p < 0.001). seven days
post-infection, significant statistical correlation the
results two methods, indicating equivalents titres particles hav
genome period infection. results reported indicate that
the duration growth hav cell culture must taken account to
correlate genome quantification infectivity.
