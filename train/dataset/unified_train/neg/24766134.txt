gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (gdept) consists targeted delivery to
tumor cells suicide gene responsible situ conversion prodrug
into cytotoxic metabolites. one major limitations strategy in
clinical application poor prodrug activation capacity suicide gene. we
built highly efficient suicide gene capable bioactivating prodrug
cyclophosphamide (cpa) fusing cyp2b6 triple mutant nadph cytochrome
p450 reductase (cyp2b6tm-red). expression fusion gene via recombinant
lentivirus (lv) vector converted resistant human (a549) murine (tc1)
pulmonary cell lines cpa-susceptible cell lines. tested efficiency of
our gdept strategy c57bl/6 immunocompetent mice, using tc1 cells expressing
the hpv-16 e6/e7 oncoproteins. mice bearing tumors composed of
tc1-cyp2b6tm-red cells, four cpa injections (140 mg/kg week) completely
eradicated tumors two months. tumors 25% of
tc1-cyp2b6tm-red cells also completely eradicated five cpa injections,
demonstrating major vivo bystander effect. moreover, surviving mice were
rechallenged parental tc1 cells. tumors regressed spontaneously 7 days
after cell inoculation grew slowly control naive mice due a
strong immune response mediated anti-e7cd8(+)t cells. data suggest 
combining cypb6tm-red gene cpa may hold promise highly effective
treatment solid tumors humans.
