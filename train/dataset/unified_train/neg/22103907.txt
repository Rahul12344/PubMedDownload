aim:   investigate efficacy safety pegylated interferon (peg-ifn)
α-2b plus ribavirin (rbv) combination treatment patients chronic
hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection persistently normal alanine
aminotransferase (nalt).
methods:   multicenter study included 989 patients hcv genotype 1 (114 
with nalt 875 elevated alt) received weight-based doses peg-ifn
α-2b plus rbv 48 weeks. compared sustained viral response (svr) rates 
of patients nalt elevated alt received least 80% the
target dosage peg-ifn α-2b 60% target rbv (minimum
acceptable dosage).
results:   significant difference found overall svr rate between
the nalt (42.1%) elevated alt groups (37.3%). significant difference in
the svr rates found nalt (63.3%) elevated alt group (61.6%)
patients received minimum acceptable dosage. multivariate analysis showed
that age (<65 years old) total cholesterol (≧220 mg/dl) significantly
independent positive factors associated svr nalt group.
twenty-four weeks treatment, alt increase normal range was
observed 34.0% (18 53) non-responsive group nalt patients.
conclusions:   efficacy safety peg-ifn α-2b plus rbv combination
therapy patients chronic hcv infection similar patients with
nalt elevated alt levels. results indicate patients
with nalt considered treatment peg-ifn α-2b plus rbv.
