we developed filamentous phage display system detection of
asparagine-linked glycoproteins escherichia coli carry plasmid encoding
the protein glycosylation locus (pgl) campylobacter jejuni. assay,
fusion target glycoproteins minor phage coat protein g3p results the
display glycans phage. glyco-epitope displayed phage product 
of biosynthetic enzymes encoded c. jejuni pgl pathway minimally
requires three essential factors: pathway oligosaccharide biosynthesis, a
functional oligosaccharyltransferase, acceptor protein a
d/e-x(1)-n-x(2)-s/t motif. glycosylated phages could recovered lectin
chromatography enrichment factors high 2 Ã— 10(5) per round panning 
and enriched phages retained infectivity panning. using this
assay, show desired glyco-phenotypes reliably selected panning 
phage-displayed glycoprotein libraries lectins specific the
glycan. instance, used phage selection identify permissible
residues -2 position bacterial consensus acceptor site sequence.
taken together, results demonstrate genotype-phenotype link be

thus, anticipate phage display system used isolate

an invaluable tool genetic analysis protein glycosylation for
glycoengineering e. coli cells.
