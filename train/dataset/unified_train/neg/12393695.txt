membrane recruitment sh2-containing 5' inositol phosphatase 1 (ship-1) 
responsible inhibitory signals modulate phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (pi3k)-dependent signaling pathways. investigated the
molecular mechanisms underlying ship-1 activation role cd16-mediated
cytotoxicity. initially demonstrated substantial fraction of
ship-1-mediated 5' inositol phosphatase activity associates cd16 zeta chain 
after receptor cross-linking. moreover, cd16 stimulation human primary natural
killer (nk) cells induces rapid transient translocation ship-1 
lipid-enriched plasma membrane microdomains, termed rafts, associates
with tyrosine-phosphorylated zeta chain shc adaptor protein. evaluated 
confocal microscopy, cd16 engagement reverse antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (adcc) rapidly induces ship-1 redistribution toward area nk
cell contact target cells codistribution aggregated rafts where
cd16 receptor also colocalizes. functional role ship-1 modulation
of cd16-induced cytotoxicity explored nk cells infected recombinant
vaccinia viruses encoding wild-type catalytic domain-deleted mutant ship-1. we
found significant ship-1-mediated decrease cd16-induced cytotoxicity is
strictly dependent catalytic activity. data demonstrate cd16
engagement nk cells induces membrane targeting activation ship-1, which
acts negative regulator adcc function.
