centrosome aberrations frequent finding human tumors. however, very
little known molecular mechanisms leading disruption of
centrosome duplication control functional consequences aberrant
centrosome numbers. high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) e6 e7
oncoproteins overexpressed hpv-associated malignancies anogenital
tract instrumental delineating different pathways centrosome 
amplification. whereas e6 oncoprotein found provoke centrosome
accumulation, hpv-16 e7 oncoprotein triggers genuine disruption the
centrosome duplication cycle. importantly, e7 oncoprotein rapidly cause
centrosome overduplication pathway involves concurrent
formation multiple daughters single maternal centrioles (centriole
flowers). several lines evidence suggest cyclin e/cdk2 complexes and
polo-like kinase 4 (plk4) crucial players process. findings
underscore hpv-16 e7 oncoprotein unique tool dissect normal 
abnormal centriole biogenesis underlying molecular circuitry.
