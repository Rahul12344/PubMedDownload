influenza virus serious health concern. β-glucans derived plants,
bacteria, fungi shown potentiate immune system responses
including elicited vaccination. however, studies β-glucan was
administered adjuvant vaccine preparation. hypothesized that
addition commercially available whole glucan particle supplement diet
would improve immune response primary secondary influenza vaccination in
mice. β-glucan added pelleted diet fed mice concentrations
designed deliver 0 (control), 1.8 90 mg·kg(-1)·day(-1) mouse.
influenza vaccine given intramuscularly left hindlimb primary 
secondary responses assessed. supplementation β-glucan not
effective boosting immune responses vaccine, either primary or
secondary vaccination experiments. surprisingly, addition particulate β-glucan
to vaccine also failed elicit greater antibody response. these
observations suggest particular form β-glucan ineffective in
boosting immune response intramuscular influenza vaccination. study is
warranted determine use different mouse models, different vaccine
delivery systems, β-glucans purified different strains bacteria,
fungi, plants could improve outcomes using similar protocols.
