much within species genetic variation form single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (snps), typically detected whole genome sequencing (wgs) or
microarray-based technologies. however, wgs produces mostly uninformative reads
that perfectly match reference, microarrays require genome-specific
reagents. developed diff-seq, sequencing-based mismatch detection assay
for snp discovery without requirement specialized nucleic-acid reagents. 
diff-seq leverages surveyor endonuclease cleave mismatched dna molecules
that generated cross-annealing complex pool dna fragments.
sequencing libraries enriched surveyor-cleaved molecules result increased 
coverage variant sites. diff-seq detected mismatches present an
initial test substrate, specific enrichment dependent identity and
context variation. application viral sequences resulted increased
observation variant alleles biologically relevant context. diff-seq has
the potential increase sensitivity efficiency high-throughput
sequencing detection variation.
