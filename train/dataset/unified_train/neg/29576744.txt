the pb1-f2 protein influenza virus considered virulence factor,
but function inducing apoptosis may disadvantage viral
replication. host mechanisms regulate pb1-f2-induced apoptosis remain unknown.
we generated pb1-f2-deficient avian influenza virus (aiv) h9n2 found that
the mutant virus replicated less efficiently human lung epithelial cells. 
pb1-f2-deficient virus produced less apoptotic cells, indicating pb1-f2 of
the h9n2 virus promotes apoptosis, occurring early stage infection, 
the lung epithelial cells. understand host cells regulate pb1-f2-induced
apoptosis, explored identify cellular proteins interacting pb1-f2 
found hcls1-associated protein x-1 (hax-1), located mainly the
mitochondria apoptotic inhibitor, interacted pb1-f2. increased
procaspase-9 activations, induced pb1-f2, could suppressed hax-1. in
hax-1 knockdown a549 cells, replication aiv h9n2 suppressed in
parallel activation caspase-3 activation, increased early 
stage infection. hypothesize hax-1 promotes aiv replication by
interacting pb1-f2, resulting suppression apoptosis, prolonged
cell survival, enhancement viral replication. data suggest hax-1 
may promoting factor aiv h9n2 replication desensitizing pb1-f2
from apoptotic induction human lung epithelial cells.
