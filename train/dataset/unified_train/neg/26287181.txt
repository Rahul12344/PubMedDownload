borna disease virus (bdv) persists central nervous systems wide
variety vertebrates causes behavioral disorders. previous studies have
revealed metabolic perturbations associated bdv infection. however,
the pathophysiological effects different viral strains remain largely unknown.
rat cortical neurons infected human strain bdv hu-h1, laboratory bdv strain 
v, non-infected control (con) cells cultured vitro. day 12
post-infection, gas chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (gc-ms)
metabonomic approach used differentiate metabonomic profiles 35
independent intracellular samples hu-h1-infected cells (n = 12), strain
v-infected cells (n = 12), con cells (n = 11). partial least squares
discriminant analysis (pls-da) performed demonstrate discrimination
between three groups. statistical testing determined individual
metabolites displayed significant differences groups. pls-da demonstrated
that whole metabolic pattern enabled statistical discrimination between
groups. identified 31 differential metabolites hu-h1 con groups (21
decreased 10 increased hu-h1 relative con), 35 differential metabolites
in strain v con groups (30 decreased 5 increased strain v relative
to con), 21 differential metabolites hu-h1 strain v groups (8
decreased 13 increased hu-h1 relative strain v). comparative
metabonomic profiling revealed divergent perturbations key energy amino
acid metabolites natural strain hu-h1 laboratory strain v bdv. the
two bdv strains differentially alter metabolic pathways rat cortical neurons
in vitro. systematic classification provides valuable template for
improved bdv strain definition future studies.
