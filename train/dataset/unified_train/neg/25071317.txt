the purpose present review summarise current knowledge the
association single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) interferon l3
(ifnl3) gene hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection children. many studies in
adults demonstrated genetic variation ifnl3 strong predictor of
the virological response treatment-naive patients hcv genotype 1 were
treated pegylated-ifn-α ribavirin. genetic variation ifnl3 also
associated spontaneous clearance hcv. thus far, paediatric
studies explored association variations ifnl3 gene and
either spontaneous treatment-induced clearance hcv. cc genotype 
rs12979860 snp associated spontaneous clearance hcv children
independently hcv genotype. four paediatric studies shown the
cc genotype rs12979860 snp tt genotype rs8099917 snp are
associated treatment-induced (ifn monotherapy pegylated-ifn-α and
ribavirin association) clearance hcv, rs12980275 snp affect 
the virological response. possible role ifnl3 gene variation a
pre-treatment on-treatment predictor virological response children is
highly attractive still undetermined. paediatric studies needed
to evaluate testing snps ifnl3, either alone together other
predictors response treatment, could used direct treatment
strategies, including avoidance unnecessary protease inhibitor therapy 
the duration treatment.
