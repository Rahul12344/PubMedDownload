background: analysis viral genome drug resistance mutations is
state-of-the-art guiding treatment selection human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1)-infected patients. mutations alter structure viral
target proteins reduce worst case completely inhibit effect 
antiretroviral compounds maintaining ability effective replication.
modern anti-hiv-1 regimens comprise multiple drugs order prevent at
least delay development resistance mutations. however, commonly used hiv-1
genotype interpretation systems provide classifications single drugs.
the euresist initiative collected data 18,500 patients train
three classifiers predicting response combination antiretroviral therapy, 
given viral genotype information. work compare
different classifier fusion methods combining individual classifiers.
principal findings: individual classifiers yielded similar performance, and
all combination approaches considered performed equally well. gain in
performance due combining methods reach statistical significance
compared single best individual classifier complete training set.
however, smaller training set sizes (200 1,600 instances compared 2,700)
the combination significantly outperformed individual classifiers (p<0.01;
paired one-sided wilcoxon test). together consistent reduction the
standard deviation compared individual prediction engines shows a
more robust behavior combined system. moreover, using combined system 
we able identify class therapy courses led consistent
underestimation (about 0.05 auc) system performance. discovery these
therapy courses hint robustness combined system.
conclusion: combined euresist prediction engine freely available at
