background: although neonatal herpes simplex virus (hsv) potentially
devastating infection requiring prompt evaluation treatment, large-scale
assessments frequency potentially infected infants been
performed.
methods: performed retrospective cross-sectional study infants ≤60 days
old cerebrospinal fluid culture testing performed 1 23
participating north american emergency departments. hsv infection defined 
a positive hsv polymerase chain reaction viral culture. primary outcome
was proportion encounters hsv infection identified. secondary
outcomes included frequency central nervous system (cns) disseminated hsv,
and hsv testing treatment patterns.
results: 26 533 eligible encounters, 112 infants hsv identified (0.42%,
95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.35%-0.51%). these, 90 (80.4%) occurred in
weeks 1 4, 10 (8.9%) weeks 5 6, 12 (10.7%) weeks 7 9. the
median age hsv-infected infants 14 days (interquartile range: 9-24 days). 
hsv infection common 0 28-day-old infants compared 29- to
60-day-old infants (odds ratio 3.9; 95% ci: 2.4-6.2). sixty-eight (0.26%, 95% ci:
0.21%-0.33%) cns disseminated hsv. proportion infants tested for
hsv (35%; range 14%-72%) acyclovir administered (23%; range
4%-53%) varied widely across sites.
conclusions: hsv infection uncommon young infants evaluated cns
infection, particularly second month life. evidence-based approaches to
the evaluation hsv young infants needed.
