a panel microtiter plate-based colorimetric assays monitoring hsv-1 growth
has made. panel consists 4 different hsv-1 (strain kos) lacz
recombinant viruses express beta-galactosidase control of
different hsv-1 promoters derived class herpes simplex gene
expression: immediate-early (icp4), early (tk), delayed early (gd) late (gc).
inhibitors hsv-1 growth evaluated using differential effects of
the reporter viruses measure points viral replication cycle 
an inhibitor acting. aphidicolin (dna synthesis inhibitor) studied a
model compound. m.o.i. 0.05, 24 h postinfection (h p.i.), aphidicolin
inhibited 80% viral growth 1 micrograms/ml, determined reduction in
icp4-driven activity within second cycle infection. m.o.i. 5, within
the first infectious cycle, aphidicolin effect signals either 
the icp4 tk viruses 3 micrograms/ml, largely suppressing gd fully
inhibiting gc-driven signals 2 micrograms/ml. profile consistent 
the behavior expected dna synthesis inhibitor. five inhibitors unknown
mechanism evaluated. two compounds inhibited icp4-driven activity within the
first infectious cycle classified potential inhibitors viral
entry, uncoating ie gene expression (xf884, bt318). one compound inhibited gd 
and gc-driven activity without inhibiting signal icp4 tk viruses,
and classified potential dna synthesis inhibitor (ds810). two compounds 
(s5193, er622) effects gd- gc-driven activity somewhat
different aphidicolin ds810, could interpreted as
inhibition viral assembly and/or egress. potency xf884 varied 
time postinfection added cells (ic50 3.7 > 10
micrograms/ml) effects bt318 independent time addition
(ic50 11.4 micrograms/ml). results suggest xf884 inhibits viral entry while
bt318 acting viral entry, possibly direct inhibitor icp4 gene
expression. together, results suggest panel recombinant herpes
viruses utility aiding identification points herpes
life cycle antiherpes drug candidates, unknown mechanisms, are
acting.
