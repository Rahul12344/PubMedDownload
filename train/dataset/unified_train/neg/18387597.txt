neural stem cells (nscs) potential used treatment of
parkinson's disease (pd), expanded, manipulated differentiated
in vitro generate dopaminergic neurones suitable for
transplantation. since nscs tendency follow astrocytic lineage after
differentiation vitro, researchers investigating ways induce neuronal
phenotype cells. study, human immunodeficiency virus 1
(hiv-1) transactivator transcription (tat) protein transduction domain (ptd)
system used attempt promote neuronal differentiation rodent nscs.
a fusion protein incorporated tat ptd pax6 protein (a
determinant neurogenesis) created added differentiation phase
of embryonic day (e) 12 rat ventral mesencephalic (vm) neurosphere cultures.
subsequently, application dopaminergic growth factors (gfs) used an
attempt induce newly-generated neuronal progenitors adopt a
dopaminergic phenotype. addition, technique involving differentiation of
intact neurospheres (instead differentiation neurosphere-derived
dissociated cells) investigated ability promote dopaminergic
neurogenesis. immunocytochemical analysis differentiated neurosphere
cultures indicated techniques significant effect 
emergence dopaminergic neurones. moreover, upon combination these
techniques, increase dopaminergic neuronal generation observed. 
based findings present study, clear nscs greatly
influenced environment optimised vitro conditions can
support potential cells differentiate dopaminergic neurones.
