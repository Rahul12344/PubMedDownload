the mechanism hepatitis c virus (hcv) involvement innate immune responses
and immune modulation well characterized. present work, we
studied toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 tlr4, recently recognized as
the important components innate immunity, well cd4+ cd25+ cd127low/-
regulatory cells (tregs), actively suppress pathological and
physiological immune response hcv infection. study involved 31 chronic
hepatitis c patients 20 healthy controls. tlr2 tlr4 expression in
peripheral blood monocytes number tregs examined flow
cytometric analysis. overexpression tlr2 tlr4 found chronic
hepatitis c patients compared controls. furthermore, increased cytokine
production, including beta-interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
interleukin (il)-6, il-8, observed peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
from chronic hepatitis c patients challenge tlr2 tlr4 agonists.
the number tregs significantly higher chronic hepatitis c patients 
the increased tregs associated hcv genotype 1b. vitro studies
demonstrated circulating tregs suppress t-cell responses chronic
hepatitis c patients. significant correlations found viral load 
and treg number tlr2 tlr4 level chronic hepatitis c patients. 
taken together published data, results suggest tlr2, tlr4, 
and tregs correlate closely chronic hcv infection.
