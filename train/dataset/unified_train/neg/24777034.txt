advanced nucleic acid-based technologies powerful research tools novel
virus discovery need standardized broader applications as
virus detection biological products clinical samples. used
well-characterized retrovirus stocks evaluate limit detection (lod) for
broad-range pcr electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (pcr/esi-ms or
plex-id), rt-pcr assays, virus microarrays. results indicated the
absence background cellular nucleic acids, plex-id rt-pcr similar
lod xenotropic murine retrovirus-related virus (xmrv; 3.12 particles per Âµl) 
whereas sensitivity virus detection 10-fold greater using virus
microarrays. virus spiked background cellular nucleic acids,
the lod using plex-id remained same, whereas virus detection rt-pcr was
10-fold less sensitive, virus could detected microarrays. expected
endogenous retrovirus (erv) sequences detected cell lines tested and
known species-specific viral sequences detected bovine serum porcine 
trypsin. follow-up strategy developed using pcr amplification, nucleotide
sequencing, bioinformatics demonstrate rd114-like retrovirus
sequence detected plex-id canine cell lines (madin-darby canine
kidney (mdck) cf2th canine thymus) due defective, endogenous
gammaretrovirus-related sequences.
