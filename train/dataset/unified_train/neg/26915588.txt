although combination simeprevir (sim) plus sofosbuvir (sof) approved
regimen genotype 1 chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv), data regarding safety
and efficacy liver transplant recipients remain limited. multicenter
retrospective study performed determine efficacy tolerability a
12-week regimen sim/sof without ribavirin (rbv) 56 consecutive
liver transplant recipients 2014; 79% patients genotype 1a, 14% had
cirrhosis, 73% treatment experienced. sustained virological response 
12 weeks (svr12) 88% intention treat analysis (95% confidence interval,
84%-90%). four patients relapsed, on-treatment virological failures
occurred. q80k polymorphism impact svr12, trend
toward decreased sustained virological response advanced fibrosis
(p = 0.18). hcv rna detectable treatment week 4 21% patients, and
those detectable levels less likely achieve svr12 (58% versus
95%; p = 0.003). five patients baseline child-pugh class b cirrhosis, 2
of died (1 following early discontinuation therapy). additional
discontinuation resulted severe photosensitivity reaction patient 
concomitant cyclosporine. seven patients receiving rbv developed progressive
anemia requiring intervention. immunosuppression dose modifications minimal.
sim/sof 12 weeks effective well tolerated compensated liver
transplant recipients especially administered without concomitant rbv or
cyclosporine. sim/sof appears niche 12-week rbv-free
treatment regimen currently recommended guidelines compensated transplant 
recipients. however, 12 weeks may optimal duration therapy for
those detectable virus week 4 possibly cirrhosis. these
data require confirmation prospective randomized clinical trials. liver
