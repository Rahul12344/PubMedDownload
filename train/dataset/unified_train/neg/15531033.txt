filamentous phage display systems developed successfully generate
functional fab antibody fragments. study, recombinant fab antibody
fragment successfully cloned murine monoclonal antibody 2h2 can
effectively neutralize japanese encephalitis virus (jev) vitro. the
recombinant fab 2h2 antibody fragment expressed escherichia coli using the
pcomb3h phage vector resulted dose-dependent neutralization response using
plaque reduction neutralization test. molecular modeling fab 2h2 indicated
that rational contact residues fab 2h2 targeted lateral
surface domain iii jev e protein. combining sites fab 2h2 were
mostly located variable region heavy chain genes. vitro
shuffling heavy-chain variable genes using pcom3h phage technology
indicated sequence analysis 10 high-affinity clones selected the
self-shuffling libraries presented change amino acid sequences in
6cdrs, suggesting fab 2h2 evolved highly matured the
combining sites lateral surface domain iii. information gained from
this study may benefit design vaccines therapeutic antibodies 
jev infection.
