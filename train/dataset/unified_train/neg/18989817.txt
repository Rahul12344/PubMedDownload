human t-lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i)-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic
paraparesis (ham/tsp) slowly progressive, inflammatory disease the
central nervous system (cns). report patient transverse myelitis, who
exhibited acute onset rapid progression disease whose symptoms
resembled observed multiple sclerosis spinal cord presentation.
during neurological exacerbation condition, htlv-i proviral load in
the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) increased 10 times peripheral blood.
this suggests accumulation htlv-i-infected cells cns
contributes neurological exacerbation. based increased proviral load in
the csf, diagnosed disease acute progressive ham/tsp. measurement
of htlv-i proviral load csf useful diagnosis ham/tsp and
for monitoring progression.
