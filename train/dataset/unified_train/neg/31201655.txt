mutations cpt2 gene cause cpt2 deficiency affect β-oxidation of
fatty acids. study examined consequence polymorphism rs1799822
in cpt2 gene respect ev71 encephalitis chinese children. study
included 406 cases mild severe ev71 infection diagnosed rt-pcr,
together controls (n = 348). used improved multiplex ligation
detection reaction technique detect polymorphism rs1799822 cpt2 
gene. frequency (ag+gg) genotype g allele ev71 infection
group severe ev71 encephalitis group significantly lower in
the control group (p = 0.012 vs. p = 0.005, p = 0.022 vs. p = 0.006,
respectively). frequency (ag+gg) genotype g allele severe
ev71 encephalitis group markedly lower mild ev71 encephalitis
group (p = 0.045, p = 0.033). atp levels blood (ag+gg) genotype
were distinctly higher aa genotype mild severe ev71
encephalitis patients (p = 0.037, p = 0.040). polymorphism rs1799822 
cpt2 gene associated severity ev71 encephalitis may one 
the protection factors severe ev71 encephalitis.
