the major coat protein filamentous bacteriophage m13 50-residue
amphiphilic polypeptide inserted, integral membrane-spanning
protein, inner membrane escherichia coli host infection. 13c
was incorporated biosynthetically total 23 peptide carbonyls
using labeled amino acids (alanine, glycine, lysine, phenylalanine, proline).
the structure dynamics carbonyl-labeled m13 coat protein monitored by
13c nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy. assignment many resonances 
was achieved using protease digestion, ph titration, labeling the
peptide bond 13c 15n. carbonyl region natural-abundance 
13c nmr spectrum m13 coat protein sodium dodecyl sulfate solution shows
approximately eight backbone carbonyl resonances line widths much narrower
than rest. three mobile residues correspond assigned peaks
(glycine-3, lysine-48, alanine-49) individual amino acid spectra, 
another almost certainly arises glutamic acid-2. ninth residue, alanine-1,
also gives rise narrow carbonyl resonance ph well or
below pka terminal amino group. data suggest about
four residues either end protein experience large-amplitude spatial
fluctuations; rest molecule essentially rigid time scale 
the overall rotational tumbling protein-detergent complex. relative
exposure different regions detergent-bound protein monitored limited
