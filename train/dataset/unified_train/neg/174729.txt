milk fat globule membranes mammary tumour virus particles (d=1.17 g/cm3) have
been obtained milk swiss albino mice strain. comparative
biochemistry shows two structures differ significantly the
phospholipid, polypeptide glycopolypeptide patterns enzymatic activities.
however, lipid profile morphology structures suggest a
filiation plasma membrane. density fractions obtained crude
virus preparation thoroughly investigated. results suggest that
most fractions represent degraded virus and/or atypical virus assembly.
