background: infants born hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) positive mothers 
are higher risk hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. host genetic
background plays important role determining strength immune response
to vaccination. conducted study investigate association between
tumor necrosis factor (tnf) mitogen-activated protein kinase eight (mapk8)
polymorphisms low response hepatitis b vaccines.
methods: total 753 infants hbsag positive hepatitis antigen
(hbeag) negative mothers prevention mother-to-infant transmission 
hbv cohort included. five tag single nucleotide polymorphism (snps)
(rs1799964, rs1800629, rs3093671, rs769177 rs769178) tnf two tag snps 
(rs17780725 rs3827680) mapk8 genotyped using massarray platform.
results: higher percentage breastfeeding (p = 0.013) higher level of
ab titers observed high responders (p < 0.001). mapk8 rs17780725 aa
genotype increased risk low response hepatitis b vaccines (or = 3.176, 
95% ci: 1.137-8.869). additionally, subjects aa genotype may a
lower ab titer subjects ga gg genotypes (p = 0.051). compared to
infants breastfed, infants breastfed increased risk 
of low response hepatitis b vaccine (or = 2.901, 95% ci:1.306-6.441).
conclusions: mapk8 polymorphisms associated immune response hbv
vaccinations infants hbsag(+)/hbeag(-) mothers.
