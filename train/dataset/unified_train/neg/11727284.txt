patients hematological malignancies infants congenital
immunodeficiencies received blood two many populations risk for
transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (ta-gvhd). methodologies 
(eg, photoinactivation, peglyation, ultraviolet light, irradiation) 
be used prevent ta-gvhd, irradiation whole blood cellular
components currently accepted practice us food drug administration 
(fda). among newer methods developed reduce risks of
bacterial viral contaminants platelet transfusions, photochemical
treatment (pct) using psoralens long-wavelength ultraviolet (uva) irradiation
modifies bacterial viral genomes sufficiently inhibit replication. among a
broad group compounds, synthetic psoralen compound amotosalen
hydrochloride (hcl) (s-59) shown particularly effective in
inactivating bacteria viruses, without adversely affecting vitro in
vivo platelet function.
