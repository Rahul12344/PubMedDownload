objective: authors investigated whether adenoviral gene transfer the
thymus could accomplished vivo whether immunologic unresponsiveness 
recombinant adenovirus could induced intrathymic inoculation.
summary background data: major barrier clinical application of
adenovirus-mediated gene therapy diseases requiring long-lasting gene
expression immunogenicity adenoviral vectors, limits duration
of effects. experimental models, intrathymic inoculation foreign 
proteins cells proven effective means induce immunologic
tolerance.
methods: efficiency gene transfer mouse thymus direct
inoculation recombinant adenovirus compared several other
vectors. animals inoculated adenovirus-infected pancreatic islets the
thymus tested unresponsiveness virus subsequent challenge 
of adenovirus administered liver intravenous injection.
results: adenovirus accomplished highly efficient gene transfer thymus,
unlike plasmid dna, dna-liposome complexes, retrovirus, adeno-associated
virus. adenoviral transgene expression transient thymus of
immunocompetent mice persistent cd8+ t-cell-deficient severe combined 
immunodeficiency (scid) mice, implicating role cytotoxic lymphocytes 
viral clearance. intrathymic transplantation syngeneic pancreatic islet cells 
infected adenovirus impaired normal antiviral cytotoxic t-lymphocyte
response prolonged hepatic transgene expression intravenous
challenge adenovirus.
conclusions: recombinant adenovirus accomplishes highly efficient gene transfer
to thymus vivo. intrathymic inoculation adenovirus-infected islets 
be used induce immunologic unresponsiveness adenoviral vector and,
potentially, proteins might engineered encode.
