sera 102 black patients primary hepatocellular carcinoma (phc) and
hepatitis b surface antigenemia tested immunoglobulin antibody against
hepatitis b core (igm anti-hbc), hepatitis b e antigen (hbeag), hepatitis b
viral (hbv) dna. prevalences compared control group of
124 age sex matched black hbv carriers without tumor. igm anti-hbc was
present 68.6%, hbeag 32.3%, hbv-dna 26.7% patients. the
control population, igm anti-hbc present 45%, hbeag detected 3.2%, 
and hbv-dna 25.8%. conclude igm anti-hbc present appreciably more
often either hbeag hbv-dna patients phc. hbeag igm anti-hbc in
serum hbsag positive carriers may predict added risk phc development
