providence virus (prv) member family tetraviridae, family small,
positive-sense, ssrna viruses exclusively infect lepidopteran insects. prv
is known tetravirus replicates tissue culture. analysed 
the genome characterized viral translation products, showing prv has
a monopartite genome encoding three orfs: (i) p130, unique prv unknown 
function; (ii) p104, contains read-through stop signal, producing an
n-terminal product 40 kda (p40) (iii) capsid protein precursor (p81). 
there three 2a-like processing sequences: one n terminus p130
(prv-2a₁) two (prv-2a₂ prv-2a₃) n terminus p81. metabolic 
radiolabelling identified viral translation products corresponding three
orfs persistently infected cells showed read-through stop p104
and prv-2a₃ p81 functional vivo results confirmed 
vitro translation experiments. rna-dependent rna polymerase domain prv
replicase phylogenetically closely related members families
tombusviridae umbraviridae rather members family tetraviridae.
the unique genome organization, translational control systems phylogenetic
relationship replicases (+ve) plant viruses lead us propose that
prv represents novel family small insect rna viruses, distinct current 
members family tetraviridae.
