the chemokine receptor cxcr4 receptor several chemokines major
co-receptor x4 human immunodeficiency virus type-1 strains entry cell. a
three-dimensional model human cxcr4 developed homology modeling using
the high-resolution bovine rhodopsin structure template. interactions 
cxcr4 flavonoids investigated using silico docking studies. the
results underscore potential compounds may become
important new antiviral drugs combat aids. worth mentioning also that
apart existing flavonoids, many new compounds may also 
be useful topical agents inactivate virus, may act adjuvants with
other antiviral drugs.
