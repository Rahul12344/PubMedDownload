nuclear matrices uninfected spodoptera frugiperda cells infected
with autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (acmnpv) isolated and
their protein constituents compared. proteins characterized according
to size several different antibodies drosophila nuclear proteins were
employed attempt identify proteins comprising nuclear
substructure. three species lamins identified major constituents of
the nuclear matrix spodoptera cells. two dna-binding proteins molecular
weights 54 36 kda also identified components nuclear matrix
of uninfected cells. infection resulted superimposition viral proteins
upon nuclear matrix host cell. polyhedrin, basic viral dna-binding
protein (p6.9), major capsid protein acmnpv identified
immunologically components nuclear matrix fraction infected cells.
infection also resulted increased association cellular histones with
the nuclear matrix. dna-binding assays demonstrated histones p6.9 the
predominant dna-binding proteins associated nuclear matrix infected
cells. nuclear matrices uninfected cells cells infected acmnpv 
10 24 hr examined using transmission electron microscopy.
morphologically, nuclear matrix uninfected cell consists outer 
nuclear lamina (including nuclear pore complexes), internal fibrogranular
protein constituent, residual nucleolar structure. numerous viral capsids
were observed associated nuclear matrix cells infected either
wild-type acmnpv polyhedrin-deletion mutant 10 hr p.i. capsids
appeared attached end-on association internal fibrogranular 
protein network nuclear matrix. matrix-associated capsids similar
in width length packaged within polyhedra. addition the
capsids, polyhedra various stages maturation seen 24 hr following
infection cells wild-type virus. nuclear matrix the
infected cell appears play important role baculovirus assembly.
