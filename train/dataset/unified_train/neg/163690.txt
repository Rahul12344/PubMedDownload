the effects anthracycline antiboties, daunomycin adriamycin, the
dna-directed activities dna polymerases murine sarcoma virus, rat liver
(high-molecular-weight species), escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus were
determined. conditions tested, compounds greater inhibitory
effect viral polymerase cellular polymerase. the
inhibition murine sarcoma virus dna polymerase daunomycin competitive
with respect dna. viral dna polymerase concluded the
inhibition predominatly caused interaction duanomycin the
primer-template dna. also, appreciable reversal daunomycin-induced
inhibition polymerase increase mg-2+ concentration consistent
with conclusion derived competition experiments. contrast, the
inhibition rat liver m. luteus dna polymerases essentially
noncompetitive dna. also, bacterial enzymes wer e less sensitive to
inhibition drugs virion polymerase. strong preferential
