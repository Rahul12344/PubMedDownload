immunological memory classically regarded attribute antigen-specific 
t b lymphocytes adaptive immune system. cells innate immune
system, including natural killer (nk) cells, considered short-lived
cytolytic cells rapidly respond pathogens an
antigen-independent manner die off. however, nk cells recently been
described possess traits adaptive immunity, clonal expansion 
viral antigen exposure generate long-lived memory cells. review, we
will discuss current evidence viral-induced nk cell memory mice
and humans.
