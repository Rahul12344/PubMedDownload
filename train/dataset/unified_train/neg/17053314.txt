using standard total culturable virus assay-most probable number (tcva-mpn)
method, evaluated total 348 samples, including surface water, finished
water, tap water samples, collected randomly selected water treatment
plants korea august 2001 july 2005 according information
collection rule. tcva-positive samples also subjected integrated 
cell culture-pcr (icc-pcr) methods detection enteroviruses, hepatitis 
a virus, adenoviruses, reoviruses. probable number infectious
units per 100 liters environmental water samples ranged 0.5 47.3.
nine 13 tcva-positive samples (69.2%) found icc-pcr positive
for human enteroviruses, confirmed coxsackievirus type b3,
coxsackievirus type b4, coxsackievirus type b6, echovirus type 30, vaccine
strain poliovirus type 3 direct sequencing. eleven 13 tcva-positive
samples (84.6%) found icc-pcr assay positive reoviruses. the
serotype reoviruses reovirus type 1 direct
sequencing. enteroviruses reoviruses concurrently detected seven
tcva-positive samples (53.8%).
