following injury activation immune cell lines, elevation of
intracellular ca2+ concentration (cai2+) early major event that
precedes cell death. agents shown elevate cai2+ result subsequently 
the death cells include human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) (in t4+
cells), 25-hydroxy cholesterol, tumor necrosis factor (tnf), cyclosporine,
dexamethasone, alpha-interferon, ca2+ ionophores. effects these
agents, cai2+ cytotoxicity, additive. type of
ca2+-related cytotoxicity may associated either accelerated synthesis 
triglycerides (tnf), accelerated synthesis cholesterol ester (25-hydroxy
cholesterol), cholesterol (hiv) terminally declining synthesis of
structural phospholipid. agents lower cai2+ (e.g., phorbol esters,
diglycerides, lipoproteins [ldl], oleic acid, serum) appropriate
conditions ameliorate ca2+-induced cytotoxicity. metabolism divalent
metals, i.e., zn2+ cd2+, also become altered cell injury, e.g.,
glucocorticoids elevate cai2+, block uptake zn2+. observations
support idea chronic elevation cai2+ many chemically unrelated
agents leads cell death creating imbalance cell biosynthetic
mechanisms--especially controlling lipid metabolism--as well creating
imbalances metabolism trace metals, especially zn2+.
