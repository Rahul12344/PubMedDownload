temperature-sensitive mutants.

explant cultures human trigeminal ganglia derived 36 individuals.
those cultures failed release herpes simplex virus (hsv) spontaneously
were superinfected various times establishment vitro range 
hsv-2 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants. eight cultures six individuals
contained hsv-specific genetic information could detected rescued
following superinfection. restriction enzyme analysis ts+ virus recovered from
the ganglia two individuals following superinfection identical 
endogenous hsv-1 spontaneously released parallel cultures. retrieval ts+ 
virus technique suggests products superinfecting virus activated
expression whole genomes spontaneous virus expression occurred
unrelated act superinfection.
