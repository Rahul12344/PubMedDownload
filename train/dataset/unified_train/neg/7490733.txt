molecular modeling analysis recently published x-ray crystal structure 
nevirapine bound wild type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse
transcriptase (wt-rt) indicated presence lipophilic cavity proximal to
the 4-position inhibitor. series 4-substituted derivatives of
nevirapine thus synthesized assess structure-activity relationships
(sars) see increased binding region might translate into
greater activity mutant rts. results show compounds an
appropriately spaced aryl ring appended 4-position the
dipyridodiazepinone ring system show good activity wt-rt. furthermore
certain derivatives appear inhibit y181c mutant rt. attempts combine
these results recent discovery 2-substituents enhance activity
against y181c mutant led compounds moderate activity against
both enzymes. sar two positions, however, could combined a
simple fashion.
