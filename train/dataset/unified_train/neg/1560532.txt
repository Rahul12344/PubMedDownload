the gene encoding bacteriophage t7 rna polymerase (t7gene1) placed 
control regulatory elements escherichia coli lac operon construct 
an inducible vaccinia virus expression system consisting entirely prokaryotic 
transcriptional machinery. regulated expression t7 rna polymerase was
necessary construct stable recombinant vaccinia virus harboring t7
promoter; otherwise, uncontrolled expression led interference endogenous 
virus replication. end, gene encoding repressor protein the
lac operon fused viral early/late promoter expressed
constitutively, lac operator interposed viral major late
promoter t7gene1. greater 99% repression t7 rna polymerase, was
relieved approximately 80-fold presence inducer
isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside (iptg), obtained. expression
cassette containing t7 promoter-controlled beta-galactosidase reporter gene was
recombined different region viral genome containing t7gene1. a
stable, double recombinant virus isolated grown high titer. the
absence inducer, beta-galactosidase expression substantially repressed.
addition increasing amounts iptg induced expression beta-galactosidase
to point suppression viral replication. hybrid vaccinia virus
system (vac/op/t7) potential applications efficient bioproduction 
a wide variety gene products.
