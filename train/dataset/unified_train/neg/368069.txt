processiveness dna polymerases. comparative study using simple procedure.

das sk, fujimura rk.

in communication, describe simple procedure analyzing the
processiveness dna polymerases general. choosing conditions which
the number incorporations per available primer less 1, reduced
the probability primer molecule utilized enzyme once.
the primer-template used poly(da)300:oligo(dt)10, product was
isolated oligo(dt)-cellulose chromatography. number dtmp residues added
per association determined [3h]dthd + [3'-3h]dtmp/[3h]dthd ratio 
the product digestion micrococcal nuclease spleen
phosphodiesterase. using procedure, found escherichia coli dna 
polymerase i, t4 dna polymerase, calf thymus alpha- beta-dna polymerase
are "quasi-processive." enzymes add average approximately 10
to 15 nucleotides dissociating template. t5 dna polymerase, on
the hand, processive, i.e. continues replicate given template
until close 5' end template. "nicked dna-like"
poly(da):oligo(dt), processiveness e. coli dna polymerase increased
2- 2.5-fold. significance increase determining "patch size"
during dna repair discussed.
