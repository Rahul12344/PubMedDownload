chemokine receptor expression may vary dramatically among cell subsets.
therefore, stage differentiation lineage cd4 cells may
profoundly affect susceptibility infection human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1). however, mechanisms coreceptor competition for
association hiv-1 glycoproteins remain unknown. here, propose
mathematical models address interdependence concentrations cd4
and ccr5 efficient infection m-tropic hiv-1 well additional
complications originated coreceptor competition caused posttranslational
modifications positively negatively affect coreceptor ability form
complexes cd4 and/or hiv-1 envelope. furthermore, since ccr5 cxcr4
expression human leukocytes designate cells hiv-1 potential targets, 
the expression major hiv-1 coreceptors also dynamically
modeled/quantified function stage cell differentiation. results show
that although coreceptor competition degree limited influence r5 strain
infectivity, infectivity cxcr4-using isolates strongly depends cd4 
expression, according coreceptor competition model proposed lee et al. 
[j. virol. 74(11) (2000) 5016]. understanding role vivo alterations 
cd4, ccr5 cxcr4 densities hiv-1 cell entry may help development of
optimal control strategies aids pathogenesis.
