the expression antigens molecules recombinant vaccinia viruses
requires insertion coding sequence specific sites viral genome. 
here investigate influence two different sites level protein 
expressed viral infection. level immune response mice to
vaccinia virus-expressed murine interleukin 2 (il-2) il-4 varied depending 
whether coding sequence inserted vaccinia virus thymidine kinase
(tk) gene hindiii f fragment viral genome herpes simplex
virus (hsv) tk used selectable marker. case intensity the
response greater relevant gene expressed hindiii f
insertion site. order quantify differences series recombinant
viruses expressing luciferase constructed. luciferase activity coding
sequence inserted hindiii f fragment significantly higher 
from tk gene insertion, provided hsv tk(+) constructs compared.
insertion marker gene (hsv tk) hindiii f site disruption of
the f7l open reading frame led reduced level luciferase expressed from
the tk insert, despite 45 kb intervening sequence. mice,
luciferase expression higher hindiii f inserted gene the
tk insert lungs ovaries.
