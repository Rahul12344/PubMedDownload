background: patients hemophilia rely exogenous factor viii prevent
bleeding joints, soft tissue, central nervous system. although
successful gene transfer reported patients hemophilia b, the
large size factor viii coding region precluded improved outcomes 
gene therapy patients hemophilia a.
methods: infused single intravenous dose codon-optimized
adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (aav5) vector encoding b-domain-deleted human
factor viii (aav5-hfviii-sq) nine men severe hemophilia a. participants
were enrolled sequentially one three dose cohorts (low dose [one
participant], intermediate dose [one participant], high dose [seven
participants]) followed 52 weeks.
results: factor viii activity levels remained 3 iu less per deciliter in
the recipients low intermediate dose. high-dose cohort, the
factor viii activity level 5 iu per deciliter weeks 2 9
after gene transfer seven participants, level six participants 
increased normal value (>50 iu per deciliter) maintained 1 year 
after receipt dose. high-dose cohort, median annualized
bleeding rate among participants previously received prophylactic therapy
decreased 16 events study 1 event gene transfer, and
factor viii use participant-reported bleeding ceased participants 
in cohort week 22. primary adverse event elevation the
serum alanine aminotransferase level 1.5 times upper limit normal
range less. progression preexisting chronic arthropathy one participant 
was serious adverse event. neutralizing antibodies factor viii
were detected.
conclusions: infusion aav5-hfviii-sq associated sustained
normalization factor viii activity level period 1 year six of
seven participants received high dose, stabilization hemostasis and
a profound reduction factor viii use seven participants. small 
study, safety events noted, safety conclusions drawn.
