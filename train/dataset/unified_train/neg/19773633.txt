objectives: hiv-related enhancement gut microbial translocation associated 
with progression hepatic fibrosis. although hepatic macrophages (kupffer
cells) clear microbial translocation products infected hiv,
their fate hiv progression carefully investigated.
methods: studied kupffer cell density (kcd) 76 hiv-hepatitis c virus
coinfected patients investigated various stages liver disease cd4(+)
lymphocyte depletion (and restoration).
results: kcd averaged 23 cells per high-powered field (range 4.4-52.2) was
highest portal periportal regions compared centrilobular regions
(p < 0.001). differences detected kcd age, liver fibrosis stage, or
hepatic inflammatory score. compared individuals without apparent
hiv-related immunosuppression, however, kcd substantially lower persons
with lower peripheral blood cd4(+) lymphocyte counts (p = 0.027) lowest among
those deepest cd4(+) lymphocyte nadir (p = 0.006). initial liver
biopsy, eight patients began antiretroviral therapy immune restoration (>
or = 2-fold increase peripheral cd4(+) lymphocyte count) second
histologic evaluation median 36.8 months later (range 28.1-58.4
months); kcd increased (p = 0.007).
conclusion: given central role kupffer cells controlling microbial
translocation, data suggest kupffer cell loss needs considered the
pathogenesis liver fibrosis hiv-hepatitis c virus coinfected persons. the
abundance portal periportal kupffer cells suggestive their
contribution fibrosis periportal regions chronic viral hepatitis.
