apple latent spherical virus (alsv) expressing green fluorescent protein
(gfp-alsv) used analysis virus-induced gene silencing (vigs) in
tobacco plants expressing gfp (gfp-tobacco). gfp-tobacco inoculated with
gfp-alsv, small dark spots appeared inoculated leaves 5 days
post-inoculation (dpi), expanded, finally covered whole area 
leaves 12 dpi. fluorescence upper leaves 12th true
leaf disappeared 21 dpi. thus, gfp-alsv infection efficiently triggered vigs
of transgene (gfp gene) tobacco plants. analysis gfp-silenced leaves
showed viral rnas proteins accumulated leaves gfp mrna
had degraded. sirnas derived alsv-rnas detected samples
from sirna gfp mrna could easily detected. direct tissue blot
analysis showed spread gfp-alsv always preceded induction vigs
in infected leaves gfp-tobacco. gfp leaf patch tests using nicotiana
benthamiana line 16c showed vp20, one three capsid proteins, a
silencing suppressor interferes systemic silencing.
