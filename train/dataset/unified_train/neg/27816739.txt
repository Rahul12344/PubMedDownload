objectives: investigate accuracy colposcopy diagnosing high-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (hsil) worse (hsil+) human papillomavirus
(hpv)-infected patients atypical squamous cells undetermined significance
(ascus) cytology, determine whether genotyping viral load quantitation
can useful detecting immediate hsil+ risk patients.
study design: study included 620 cases ascus positive high-risk
(hr)-hpv within 1 month cervical cytology qilu hospital
between february 2013 february 2014. based colposcopic impression,
lesion-targeted punch biopsy, endocervical curettage biopsy random cervical
punch biopsy four quadrants performed patients within 1 month.
the accuracy colposcopy diagnosing hsil+ evaluated comparison 
with biopsy results. hr-hpv status determined hybrid capture 2 hpv
genotyping analysed retrospectively possible predictor hsil+.
results: agreement colposcopic impression cervical pathology was
matched perfectly 89.2% cases (553/620), strength agreement with
the κ statistic 0.698 (p<0.001). colposcopy high specificity (96.9%) 
low sensitivity detecting hsil+ (67.5%). risk hsil+ significantly 
higher patients hpv-16 infection (52.3%) patients infected with
other types hpv (17.9%, p<0.001). hsil+ virus load correlated at
cut-offs (co) 50 relative light units (rlu)/co 100 rlu/co (p=0.024 and
0.044, respectively). considering hpv16 infection high virus load (at 50
rlu/co) diagnostic standard hsil+ colposcopic impression was
negative, sensitivity improved 74.7% 81.0%, respectively.
conclusions: good agreement found colposcopic pathologic
diagnosis. hr-hpv genotyping virus load relevant detection hsil+ 
among hpv-infected patients ascus cytology. patients, biopsies
considering hpv-16 infection virus load ≥50 rlu/co may helpful for
increasing hsil+ detection rate.
