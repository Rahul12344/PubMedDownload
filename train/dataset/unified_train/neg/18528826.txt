we studied incidence cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection, clinical outcomes,
and complications 39 recipients alemtuzumab-containing conditioning-stem
cell transplantation, classified two groups based median
dose (35 mg) alemtuzumab. recipients donors cmv-seropositive 
before transplantation. median survival duration 321 days (range, 46-1098
days) 2-year survival rate 47.8%. probability nonrelapse
mortality 100 days 2 years 14.6% 31.2%, respectively. the
cumulative incidence grade ii-iv acute graft-versus-host disease (gvhd) day
100 21.8%. overall incidence chronic gvhd (cgvhd) 28.6%, including
a 17.9% incidence extensive cgvhd. cumulative incidence cmv antigenemia
was 68.0%. statistical differences engraftment, acute and
cgvhd, relapse, cmv antigenemia, overall survival (os) two
groups. yet, nonrelapse mortality (nrm) significantly lower the
low-dose group (5.9% vs. 51.7%, p = 0.010). present study showed that
alemtuzumab effective gvhd prevention, yet caused relatively high
incidence cmv antigenemia, regardless dose. thus, low dose of
alemtuzumab (< = 35 mg) would seem preferable allogeneic sct
setting recipient donor cmv seropositive.
