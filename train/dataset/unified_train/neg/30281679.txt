background: tuberculosis (tb) patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
co-infection worse tb treatment outcomes compared patients tb alone.
the distribution unfavourable treatment outcomes differs socio-demographic 
and clinical characteristics, allowing early identification patients at
risk.
objective: develop statistical model provide individual
probabilities unfavourable outcomes based demographic clinical
characteristics tb-hiv co-infected patients.
methodology: used data tb patients known hiv-positive test
results (aged ≥15 years) registered first-line anti-tb treatment (att) in
2015 revised national tb control programme (rntcp) delhi, india. 
included variables demographics pre-treatment clinical characteristics
routinely recorded reported rntcp national aids control
organization. binomial logistic regression used develop statistical
model estimate probabilities unfavourable tb treatment outcomes (i.e.,
death, loss follow-up, treatment failure, transfer program, a
switch drug-resistant regimen).
results: 55,260 tb patients registered att 2015 delhi, 928 (2%) 
known hiv-positive test results. these, 816 (88%) drug-sensitive tb and
were ≥15 years. among 816 tb-hiv patients included, 157 (19%) unfavourable tb
treatment outcomes. developed model predicting unfavourable outcomes
using age, sex, disease classification (pulmonary versus extra-pulmonary), tb
treatment category (new previously treated case), sputum smear grade, known
hiv status tb diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment tb diagnosis, cd4
cell count att initiation. chi-square p-value model calibration
assessed using hosmer-lemeshow test 0.15. model discrimination,
measured area receiver operator characteristic (roc) curve, 
0.78.
conclusion: model good internal validity, validated an
independent cohort tb-hiv co-infected patients assess performance
before clinical programmatic use.
