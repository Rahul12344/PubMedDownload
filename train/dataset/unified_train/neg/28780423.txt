several cinnamic acid derivatives reported exhibit antiviral
activity. study, prepared 17 synthetic cinnamic acid derivatives and
screened identify effective antiviral compound hepatitis c
virus (hcv). compound 6, one two hit compounds, suppressed viral
replications genotypes 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a ec50 values 1.5-8.1 μm and
si values 16.2-94.2. effect compound 6 phosphorylation tyr705
in signal transducer activator transcription 3 (stat3) investigated
because cinnamic acid derivative ag490 reported suppress hcv replication
and activity janus kinase (jak) 2. compound 6 potently suppressed hcv
replication, inhibit jak1/2-dependent phosphorylation stat3
tyr705 at concentration. furthermore, pan-jak inhibitor tofacitinib
potently impaired phosphorylation stat3 tyr 705, inhibit hcv
replication replicon cells hcv-infected cells same
concentration, supporting notion phosphorylated state stat3
tyr705 necessarily correlated hcv replication. production of
reactive oxygen species (ros) induced treatment compound 6, whereas
n-acetyl-cysteine restored hcv replication impaired ros production the
replicon cells treated compound 6. data suggest compound 6
inhibits hcv replication via induction oxidative stress.
