the use phylogenetics hiv molecular epidemiology considerably increased
our ability understand origin, spread, characteristics hiv
epidemics. despite potential advance knowledge hiv transmission
dynamics, ethical issues associated hiv molecular epidemiology have
received minimal attention. in-depth interviews conducted scientists
from diverse backgrounds explore perspectives ethical issues
associated phylogenetic analysis hiv genetic data applied hiv
transmission dynamics studies. emanuel framework used analytical
framework. favorable risk-benefit ratio informed consent most
invoked ethical principles fair participant selection least. fear loss
of privacy disclosure hiv transmission invariably cited key
ethical concerns. hiv sequence data become increasingly available,
comprehensive guidelines developed guide access, sharing and
use, cognizant potential harms may result.
