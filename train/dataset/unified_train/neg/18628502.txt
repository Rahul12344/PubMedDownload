a convenient rapid culture assay (rca) detection enteroviruses was
evaluated rt-pcr using 576 stool 102 cerebrospinal fluid (csf)
samples. one hundred ninety stool samples also tested conventional
cell culture (ccc). rca used immunoperoxidase staining cell culture plates
with blend monoclonal antibodies (mabs) enterovirus vp1 the
second sixth days inoculation. blend composed 5d8/1 (dako) 
and four 'in-house' mabs. ccc performed using fluorescence staining 
enterovirus screening set (chemicon international) culture confirmation.
detection enteroviruses rca successful colonic carcinoma
(caco-2) rhabdomyosarcoma (rd) cells human embryonic lung
fibroblasts, hep2 a549 cells. performance ccc rd cells hindered
by rapid cell degeneration non-specific staining cells culture
confirmation. sensitivity rca compared rt-pcr stool samples 
found 71 % (115/161) second day 87 % (140/161) sixth day.
the sensitivity rca csf samples 38 % (22/58) 2 days 59 % 
(34/58) 6 days. specificity rca 100 %. ccc-positive
samples positive rca. ccc required 3-14 days virus recovery. in
conclusion, rca sensitivity ccc, significantly shortens the
time required detection enteroviruses, prevents pitfalls
associated using rd cells ccc. diagnosis aseptic meningitis in
csf samples, rt-pcr performed.
