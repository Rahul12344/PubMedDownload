capsite.

a chimeric recombinant, containing 270 bp left-terminal fragment of
adenovirus-2 (ad2) inserted upstream -34 +33 ad2 major late promoter 
(ad2mlp) element, used characterize transcription stimulatory
element located least 231 bp upstream e1a capsite the
left-end ad2 (ref. 1). demonstrate element, acts cis,
possesses several properties characteristic transcriptional enhancers.
firstly, potentiates initiation transcription capsite the
heterologous ad2mlp "cryptic" sites often preceded tata box-like
sequences. secondly, although critical distance requirement between
the enhancer element ad2mlp, extent stimulation decreases the
distance two element increases. however, contrast other
known viral cellular enhancers bidirectional, ad2 enhancer is
unidirectional, i.e. potentiates ad2mlp element inserted
in "natural" orientation respect direction transcription.
using two convergent series deletions, localized ad2 enhancer
element within 24 bp segment located approximately 160 bp ad2
left-end, i.e. 340 bp upstream e1a capsite. 24 bp segment contains 
a sequence exhibits striking homology consensus sequence of
several viral cellular enhancers.
