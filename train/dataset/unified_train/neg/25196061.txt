many studies reported poor vital prognosis hepatitis c virus
(hcv)-infected dialysis patients. rate hcv-infected dialysis patients in
japan high 9.8%, antiviral therapy believed important for
improving vital prognosis. conducted multicenter study examine the
administration method pegylated interferon α-2a (peg-ifnα-2a) monotherapy 
hcv-infected dialysis. studied 56 patients: 14 low viral loads (hcv rna <
5.0 log iu/ml) treated 90 μg peg-ifnα-2a weekly, 42 high viral
loads (hcv rna ≥ 5.0 log iu/ml) treated 135 μg peg-ifnα-2a weekly. we
examined sustained virological response (svr), factors affecting svr, and
treatment safety. overall svr rate 39% (22/56); genotype 1,
genotype 2, low viral loads, high viral loads 29%, 67%, 93%, 21%,
respectively. receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis, hcv rna 
cutoff values likely achieve svr genotypes 1 2 <5.7 log iu/ml
(svr rate: 64% 9/14) <6.5 log iu/ml (svr rate: 88% 7/8), respectively. if
there hcv rna negativation 4 weeks (rapid virological response), svr
rate 94% (16/17), whereas 6% (1/16) hcv rna positivity at
24 weeks. rate treatment discontinuation adverse events aggravated
complications 25% (14/56). high svr rates potentially achieved with
peg-ifn monotherapy identifying target patients, based virus type and
viral load initiating treatment modifying therapy treatment 
according responsiveness.
