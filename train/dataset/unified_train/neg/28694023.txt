recent studies suggest several bacterial species involved tumor
immunosurveillance antitumor immunity. role bacteria immune
responses hbv-related hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) patients still
unknown. study, examined bacteria-reactive cd8+ cell response in
patients hbv-related hcc. found circulating cd8+ cells from
healthy individuals demonstrated minimal zero specificity toward series of
commensals bacteria previously associated antitumor effects, including
escherichia coli, enterococcus faecium, bifidobacterium longum, bacteroides
fragilis, enterococcus hirae. contrast, circulating cd8+ cells 
hbv-related hcc patients presented significantly elevated bacteria-reactive
responses, albeit high variations among different hcc individuals.
reactivity toward bacteria also identified tumor-infiltrating cd8+ t
cells. bacteria-reactive responses primarily induced tlr
ligand, dependent presence antigen-presenting monocytes, and
were mhc class i-restricted. interestingly, observed cd8+ t
cell-to-foxp3+ regulatory cell ratio positively correlated the
proportions bifidobacterium longum-reactive enterococcus hirae-reactive
cd8+ cells, frequency pd-1+ cd8+ cells negatively correlated
with frequency enterococcus hirae-reactive cd8+ cells. furthermore, 
disease-free survival time hcc patients tumor resection positively
correlated frequencies bifidobacterium longum-reactive and
enterococcus hirae-reactive cd8+ cells. together, results suggested 
certain bacterial species might present valuable antitumor effects.
