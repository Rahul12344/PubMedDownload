the murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) m56 one three proteins combine to
form mcmv terminase, required cleavage packaging viral dna into
capsids. deletion m56 bacterial artificial chromosome (bac) clone of
the mcmv genome considered lethal, mutant bac failed reconstitute
infectious virus. reintroduction m56 ectopic locus complemented the
deletion, allowing reconstitution virus replicated wild-type
efficiency. however, neither reintroduction m56 sequences encoding an
n-terminal epitope fusion mutation targeting region m56 implicated 
an atpase active site capable restoring virus viability. contrast, a
frame shift mutation m56a, putative open reading frame overlaps m56,
had effect viral replication. conclude m56a dispensable, whereas
m56 residues comprising proposed atpase active site critical for
terminase function viral replication.
