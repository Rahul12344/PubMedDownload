ts20 temperature-sensitive mutant cell line derived balb/3t3 cells that
is blocked step dna synthesis involving chain elongation. following a
shift 33 degrees 39 degrees c, mutant cells lost ability grow form 
colonies. mutant cells infected polyomavirus, cell virus 
dna synthesis inhibited restrictive temperature 39 degrees c. when
cell extracts wild-type cells added vitro lysed infected mutant
cells incubated vivo 39 degrees c expression the
mutation, cell dna synthesis increased 3-fold (similar effect in
uninfected mutant cells), whereas virus dna synthesis increased 60%.
with harsher lysis conditions, effect added extract virus dna synthesis
was greater, although baseline dna synthesis (prior addition extracts) 
much lower. analysis alkaline sucrose gradients showed addition of
cell extract converted small cellular dna molecules larger ones, it
increased synthesis small virus dna molecules rather completed
genomes. analysis cytosol extracts (in activity stimulating dna
synthesis resides) showed dna topo-isomerase activity heat-labile
when assayed mutant extracts compared wild-type extracts. contrast,
cytosol dna polymerase activity equally heat-labile mutant wild-type
extract. suggested factor extract likely associated the
activity dna topo-isomerase i. analysis virus dna synthesized vitro in
restricted mutant cells gel electrophoresis fluorography showed an
accumulation topo-isomers migrating form ii. topo-isomers,
thought manifestation ts defect, disappear extract
from wild-type cells added back vitro mutant cells shifted
back permissive temperature prior lysis vitro synthesis. results
indicate polyoma dna synthesis cell dna synthesis differ their
response mutant gene product ts20, although inhibited a
step early dna chain elongation may involve dna topo-isomerase i.
