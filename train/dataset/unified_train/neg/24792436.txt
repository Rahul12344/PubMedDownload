tylvalosin, new broad-spectrum, third-generation macrolides, may exert a
variety pharmacological activities. here, report anti-oxidative 
anti-inflammatory activity raw 264.7 macrophages mouse treated with
lipopolysaccharide (lps) well piglet challenged porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv). tylvalosin treatment markedly decreased
il-8, il-6, il-1β, pge2, tnf-α levels vitro vivo. lps and
prrsv-induced reactive oxygen species (ros) production, lipid
peroxidation mice lung tissues reduced tylvalosin treatments. mouse
acute lung injury model induced lps, tylvalosin administration significantly
attenuated tissues injury, reduced inflammatory cells recruitment and
activation. evaluated phospholipase a2 (pla2) activity increased
expressions cpla2-iva, p-cpla2-iva spla2-ive lowered tylvalosin.
consistent mouse results, tylvalosin pretreatment attenuated piglet lung
scores improved growth performance normal rectal temperature piglet
model induced prrsv. furthermore, tylvalosin attenuated iκbα
phosphorylation degradation, blocked nf-κb p65 translocation. these
results indicate addition direct antimicrobial effect, tylvalosin 
exhibits anti-inflammatory property attenuates acute lung injury through
suppression nf-κb activation.
