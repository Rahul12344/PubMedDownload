objective: evaluate pharmacokinetics didanosine patients normal
kidney function chronic kidney failure.
methods: three groups patients human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
infection studied: group i, six men normal kidney function (creatinine 
clearance > 90 ml/min/1.73 m2); group ii, six men chronic renal failure
maintained continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (capd); group iii,
four men two women chronic renal failure receiving hemodialysis three
times week. 300 mg dose didanosine administered orally and
intravenously according two-period randomized crossover design. patients 
group iii studied hemodialysis sessions crossover
periods. addition, patients group iii studied third period 
administration 300 mg oral dose didanosine 4 hours hemodialysis.
results: intravenous administration group i, mean (+/-sd) total
clearance (clt) 13.0 +/- 1.6 ml/min/kg elimination half-life (t 1/2) 
was 1.56 +/- 0.43 hour. groups ii iii, clt decreased significantly 
3.4 +/- 1.2 3.2 +/- 1.2 ml/min/kg, respectively, whereas t1/2 increased
to 3.60 +/- 0.82 hours 3.11 +/- 0.88 hours, respectively. absolute
bioavailability didanosine groups i, ii, iii 42% +/- 12%, 52% +/-
6%, 38% +/- 11%, respectively, differ significantly. capd had
little effect removal didanosine, whereas approximately 30% drug
present body start dialysis eliminated average 3-hour 
dialysis session.
conclusion: clearance didanosine impaired patients chronic
renal failure. compensate, dose schedule administration be
adjusted. recommended one-fourth total daily dose didanosine
be administered day patient population.
