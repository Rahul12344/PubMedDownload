the glycoprotein g (gg-2) purified hsv-2 infected cells reported to
be useful determination hsv-2 type-specific antibodies using conventional 
elisa formats. study confirmed specificity gg-2 and
demonstrated feasibility specific igm assay. gg-2 elisa was
developed detect hsv-2 specific igg igm antibodies human sera high
levels sensitivity specificity. 45 patients culture-proven
recurrent hsv-2 genital infection 44 reactive gg-2 igg. 30 sera 
patients culture-proven recent initial hsv-2 genital infection 29 were
positive gg-2 igm. three patients primary hsv-2 genital infection showed
gg-2 igm convalescent acute sera. igg- igm-gg-2
elisa showed high specificity. none 40 sera children reactive by
either assay. one 94 sera patients antibody herpesviruses
other hsv reacted igg assay none reacted igm assay. 
was cross-reaction sera patients proven hsv-1 infection with
the gg-2 antigen. results suggest igg assay used for
demonstration past hsv-2 infection igm assay diagnosis of
hsv-2 neonatal herpes primary genital herpes, cultures rapid
diagnostic techniques unavailable.
