recurrent hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection liver graft characterized
by severe outcome high level hbv replication. many investigators,
retransplantation appears contraindicated constant recurrence a
high mortality. report experience setting. january 1985
and december 1995, 10 patients underwent retransplantation hbv graft
reinfection studied. according antiviral treatment administered after
hbv recurrence first liver graft protocol antiviral prophylaxis
after retransplantation, two groups defined: group 1 underwent
retransplantation january 1992 (n = 5), group 2 underwent
retransplantation january 1992 (n = 5). time reinfection, serum
hbv dna positive patients, hepatitis antigen (hbeag) positive
in 6 patients. antiviral therapy administered 7 patients (group 1, adenine
arabinoside mono phosphate [ara-amp; n = 3]; group 2, ara-amp [n = 5],
ganciclovir [n = 4]). retransplantation, long-term antibody hb surface
antigen (anti-hbs) immunoglobulins administered achieve anti-hbs titer
greater 100 iu/l group 1 achieve anti-hbs titer greater than
500 iu/l associated prophylactic intravenous ganciclovir administration (5
mg/kg three times weekly) 2 years group 2. group 1, patients died, 
either perioperatively secondary hbv recurrence (1 year survival, 0%). in
group 2, 1 patient died 50 months retransplantation hbv cirrhosis the
second graft, 4 patients remained hbsag negative mean 41 months
(range, 24 68 months) retransplantation. prognosis of
retransplantation hbv recurrence dramatically improved the
administration antiviral therapy retransplantation maintenance 
of high anti-hbs level combined antiviral therapy retransplantation.
