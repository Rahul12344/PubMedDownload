killer cell ig-like receptors (kir) mhc class i-binding immunoreceptors 
can suppress activation human nk cells recruitment src homology
2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-1 (shp-1) two immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (itims) cytoplasmic domains. kir2dl4
(2dl4; cd158d) structurally distinct member kir family, is
expressed most, all, human nk cells. 2dl4 contains one itim its
cytoplasmic domain arginine transmembrane region, suggesting both
inhibitory activating functions. 2dl4 activate ifn-gamma
production, dependent upon transmembrane arginine, function single
itim 2dl4 remains unknown. study, tandem itims kir3dl1 (3dl1) and
the single itim 2dl4 directly compared functional biochemical
assays. using retroviral transduction method, show human nk cell lines
that 1) single itim 2dl4 efficiently inhibits natural cytotoxicity
responses; 2) phosphorylated single itim recruits shp-2 protein tyrosine
phosphatase, shp-1 nk cells; 3) expression dominant-negative shp-1 
does block ability 2dl4 inhibit natural cytotoxicity; 4)
surprisingly, mutation tyrosine within single itim completely
abolish inhibitory function; 5) correlates weak shp-2 binding to
the mutant itim 2dl4 nk cells corresponding nonphosphorylated itim
peptide vitro. results reveal new aspects kir-inhibitory pathway 
in human nk cells, shp-1 phosphotyrosine independent.
