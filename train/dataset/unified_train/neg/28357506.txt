background: impact hepatitis c virus (hcv) infections patient long-term
survival renal transplants unclear.
method: clarify long-term outcomes japanese renal allograft recipients 
with hcv infections, studied cases 187 patients (118 males 69
females; 155 living donor cases, 32 deceased donor cases; median follow-up
period: 250 months) underwent initial renal transplant kanazawa medical
university 1974 onwards.
result: cohort, 35 patients (18.7%) hcv core antigen (ag)-positive, 
and 13 (37.1%) died (due liver cirrhosis (4 cases), hepatocellular
carcinoma (1 case), fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis due hcv (1 case), and
infections complicated chronic hepatitis (6 cases)). however, 14 the
145 (9.7%) recipients died hcv-ag/hcv antibody (ab)-negative group. the
kaplan-meier life table method indicated hcv-infected group exhibited
significantly lower patient death-censored allograft survival rates (log-rank
test; patient survival: chi-square: 11.2, p = 0.004; graft survival: chi-square: 
25.7, p < 0.001). survival rate hcv-ag-positive recipients decreased
rapidly 240 months renal transplant procedure. addition, cox
proportional hazards model indicated positivity hcv-ag 
important independent risk factor post-renal transplant survival and
allograft function [survival: hazard ratio (hr) 3.93 (1.54-10.03), p = 0.004;
graft function: hr 2.09 (1.14-3.81), p = 0.016].
conclusion: hcv infection harmful risk factor patient survival
(especially ≥20 years post-renal transplant) renal allograft function in
allograft recipients.
