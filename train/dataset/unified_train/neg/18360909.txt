infection human papillomavirus 16 (hpv16), one 15 types of
hpv causally associated cervical cancer accounts 50% cases,
can prevented type-specific manner hpv16 virus-like particle (vlp) 
vaccine comprised particles l1 protein alone. attempted modify
the vlp vaccine inserting hpv16 l2-peptides including cross-neutralization
epitopes l1 polypeptide. chimeric l1 had, l1 amino acids
(aa) 430 433, l2 sequence aa 18-38, 56-75, 96-115 (with the
replacements aa 101 aa 112 l s, respectively). the
three chimeric l1s expressed recombinant baculovirus insect
sf9 cells, resultant vlps characterized. chimeric vlps were
shown present l2-peptides surface. immunizing rabbits the
vlps, shown retained capability induce antibody
neutralizing hpv16 acquired capability elicit antibodies
cross-neutralizing infectious hpv18, 31, 52, 58 pseudovirions. although
the cross-neutralizing titers lower type-specific neutralizing
titer, results suggest chimeric vlps potential serve a
vaccine candidate broad spectrum high-risk hpvs.
