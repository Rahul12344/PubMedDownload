the primary human urethral epithelial cells developed laboratory been
immortalized transduction retroviral vector expressing human
papillomavirus e6e7 oncogenes. analysis telomerase expression comparison
to primary cells revealed detectable levels transduced human
urethral epithelial cells. immortalized urethral cells could passaged 20 
times. immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed immortalized cells
were phenotypically similar responded gonococcal infection similarly to
primary cells. specifically, positive cytokeratin staining showed the
immortalized cells keratinocytes; cell surface levels human
asialoglycoprotein receptor increase following gonococcal infection, and, like
the primary cells, immortalized urethral epithelial cells cd14 negative. 
using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, found interleukin-6 (il-6) and
il-8 levels primary urethral epithelial cell supernatants increase after
challenge n. gonorrhoeae. likewise, immortalized urethral epithelial
cells produced higher levels il-6 il-8 cytokines response gonococcal
infection. cells challenged gonococcal lipid msbb mutant produced
reduced il-6 il-8 levels compared parent strain. additionally,
these data suggest 1291 msbb lipooligosaccharide may suppress cytokine
induction.
