objective: identify histopathologic changes major organs correlate
clinical symptoms patients infected avian influenza h5n1.
methods: autopsy study performed two patients died avian influenza hsn1
infection, following conventional protocols strict safety procedures. tissue 
samples major organs two cases lung samples one case were
collected fixed 4% formaldehyde. histopathologic changes evaluated by
light microscope.
results: diffuse alveolar damage (dad) lung seen cases.
lesions various stages development seen involving different areas of
the lung. early stages, lungs exhibited exudative changes, including
capillary congestion, necrosis alveolar epithelial cells, intra-alveolar
edema. hyaline membranes prominent diffusely distributed along alveoli. 
in middle-late stages disease, lungs exhibited proliferative and
fibrotic changes, including proliferation pneumocytes bronchial
epithelium, fibrosis interstitium alveolar spaces. lung biopsy tissue 
of one case showed dad interstitial fibrosis background of
bronchiectasis. lymph nodes spleens showed quantity reduction lymphocytes 
and active hemophagocytosis. changes major organs included interstitial 
carditis one case acute renal tubular necrosis one case. one case,
the brain showed edema cytoplasmic eosinophilia, loss structure, axon
welling focal necrosis around ventricle. multiple foci trophoblastic
necrosis dystrophic calcification observed placenta one pregnant 
patient. acute necrotizing deciduitis found focally. sections fetal lung
showed edema scattered interstitial neutrophils consistent acute
interstitial pneumonitis.
conclusions: respiratory tract major target avian influenza h5n1 
virus infection. changes dad lungs resulted hypoxia, leading 
multiple organ failure death.
