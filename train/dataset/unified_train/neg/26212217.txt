different isoindolinedione derivatives bearing imine, amide, thioamide, and
sulfonamide linkages designed silico using discovery studio software
(biovia, san diego, ca, usa), synthesized, evaluated anti-hiv
activity. sar studies revealed linkages molecules affect
their anti-hiv activity molecules sulfonamide linkages the
most potent hiv-rt inhibitors s=o bonds sulfonamide moiety
interacted lys103 (nh carbonyl both) pro236; nh part the
sulfonamide linkage formed bond carbonyl lys101. blood-brain barrier
(bbb) plots also studied, found designed molecules
have potential cross bbb, vital criteria anti-hiv drugs. vitro
screening performed using hiv-1 strain iiib mt-4 cells using mtt
assay, seen molecules effective inhibitors 
hiv-1 replication nanomolar concentration selectivity indices ranging
from 33.75 73.33 in vitro conditions. molecules shown
good anti-hiv activity 3-4 nm concentrations. derivatives potential
to developed lead molecules effective hiv-1. novel isoindolinedione
derivatives probable nnrtis synthesized characterized. of
these molecules shown good anti-hiv activity 3-4 nm concentrations.
