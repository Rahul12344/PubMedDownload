vascular endothelial growth factor-a (vegf-a) promotes angiogenesis by
stimulating migration, proliferation organization endothelium, the
activation signaling pathways involving src tyrosine kinase. had
previously shown src-mediated activation diacylglycerol kinase-alpha
(dgk-alpha) required hepatocytes growth factor-stimulated cell migration, 
we asked whether dgk-alpha involved transduction angiogenic
signaling. pae-kdr cells, endothelial-derived cell line expressing vegfr-2,
vegf-a165, stimulates enzymatic activity dgk-alpha: activation is
inhibited r59949, isoform-specific dgk inhibitor, dependent src
tyrosine kinase, dgk-alpha forms complex. conversely huvec,
vegf-a165-induced activation dgk partially sensitive r59949,
suggesting also isoforms may activated, albeit still dependent on
src tyrosine kinase. specific inhibition dgk-alpha, obtained cells 
r59949 pae-kdr expression dgk-alpha dominant-negative mutant,
impairs vegf-a165-dependent chemotaxis, proliferation vitro angiogenesis. 
in addition, huvec, specific downregulation dgk-alpha sirna impairs in
vitro angiogenesis matrigel, suggesting requirement dgk-alpha 
in angiogenic signaling huvec. thus, propose activation dgk-alpha
generates signal essential proliferative migratory response to
vegf-a165, suggesting may constitute novel pharmacological target for
angiogenesis control.
