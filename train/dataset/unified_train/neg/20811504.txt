high-density cultures mammalian neurons offer model system studies of
brain development, morphological features individual neurons is
difficult ascertain. show herpes virus vector expressing a
bioluminescent protein allows detailed morphometric analyses living neurons in
complex culture environments. expression enhanced green fluorescent protein
(egfp) constitutively driven neurons using herpes simplex virus
amplicon system. system allowed us make novel observations regarding
development high-density cultures rat hippocampus cerebellum. after
the phase initial neurite outgrowth, maturing neurons continue show rapid
remodeling neurite branches (0.79 +/- 0.11 mum/h per neurite; mean +/-
sem, n=8), displacement soma within neurite arbor (1.35 +/- 0.74
mum/h). results demonstrate substantial capacity morphological
plasticity persists maturing mammalian cns neurons cessation net
