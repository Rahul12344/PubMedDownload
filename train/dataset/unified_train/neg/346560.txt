outer membrane proteins escherichia coli. vii. evidence that
bacteriophage-directed protein 2 functions pore.

pugsley ap, schnaitman ca.

protein 1, major protein outer membrane escherichia coli, been
shown pore allowing passage small hydrophilic solutes across the
outer membrane. e. coli k-12 protein 1 consists two subspecies, 1a 1b, 
whereas e. coli b consists single species electrophoretic
mobility similar 1a. k-12 strains mutant ompb locus lack both
proteins 1a 1b exhibit multiple transport defects, resistance toxic
metal ions, tolerance number colicins. mutation tolf locus
results loss 1a, less severe transport defects, limited
colicin tolerance. mutation par locus causes loss protein 1b, but
no transport defects colicin tolerance. lysogeny e. coli phage pa-2
results production new major protein, protein 2. lysogeny k-12
ompb mutants resulted dramatic reversal transport defects and
restoration sensitivity colicins e2 e3 colicins.
this shown due production protein 2, since lysogeny phage 
mutants lacking ability elicit protein 2 production show this
effect. thus, protein 2 function effective pore. ompb mutations e.
coli b also resulted loss protein 1 similar multiple transport defects,
but partially reversed phage lysogeny resulting
production protein 2. ompb region e. coli b moved by
transduction e. coli k-12 background, small amounts proteins 1a
and 1b found outer membrane. results indicate genes
governing synthesis outer membrane proteins may function
interchangeably k-12 b strains, indicating differences regulation 
or biosynthesis proteins strains.
