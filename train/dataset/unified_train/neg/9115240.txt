amino acid sequencing subunits multicatalytic proteinase complex (mpc) 
isolated bovine spleen showed almost complete replacement x, y,
and z subunits, constitutively expressed tissues, the
interferon-gamma-inducible lmp7, lmp2, mecl1 subunits. comparison 
pituitary mpc found decreased chymotrypsin-like activity, depressed
peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolyzing activity, highly active component with
properties similar to, identical with, pituitary branched
chain amino acid preferring (braap) component. unlike pituitary braap
component, spleen mpc exhibited greatly decreased km, highly
increased catalytic efficiency (kcat), 80-180 times greater specificity
constant (kcat/km) toward substrates either branched chain aromatic amino
acid residues p1 position. also, unlike pituitary braap component,
that spleen sensitive inactivation 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and
sensitive inhibition peptidyl-aldehydes either phenylalaninal or
leucinal residues. several phenylalaninal peptidyl-aldehydes identified
which selectively inhibited components spleen pituitary
mpc. two inhibitors dipeptidyl-aldehydes, two others are
tetrapeptidyl-aldehydes pro residue p3 position. possibility is
discussed properties specificity spleen mpc consequence
of presence interferon-gamma-inducible subunits.
