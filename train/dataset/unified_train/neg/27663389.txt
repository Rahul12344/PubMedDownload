background: glioblastoma (gbm) common primary malignant brain tumor
and dismal prognosis. measles virus (mv) therapy gbm promising
strategy due preclinical efficacy, excellent clinical safety, ability 
to evoke antitumor pro-inflammatory responses. hypothesized combining
anti- programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-pd-1) blockade mv therapy can
overcome immunosuppression enhance immune effector cell responses against
gbm, thus improving therapeutic outcome.
methods: vitro assays mv infection glioma cells infected glioma
cells mouse microglia ± apd-1 blockade established assess damage
associated molecular pattern (damp) molecule production, migration, and
pro-inflammatory effects. c57bl/6 athymic mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic
gl261 gliomas treated mv, apd-1, combination treatment. t2*
weighted immune cell-specific mri fluorescence activated cell sorting (facs) 
analysis treated mouse brains used examine adaptive immune responses
following therapy.
results: vitro, mv infection induced human gbm cell secretion damp
(high-mobility group protein 1, heat shock protein 90) upregulated programmed
cell death ligand 1 (pd-l1). mv infection gl261 murine glioma cells resulted
in pro-inflammatory response increased migration bv2 microglia. vivo,
mv+apd-1 therapy synergistically enhanced survival c57bl/6 mice bearing
syngeneic orthotopic gl261 gliomas. mri showed increased inflammatory cell influx
into brains mice treated mv+apd-1; facs analysis confirmed increased 
t-cell influx predominantly consisting activated cd8+ cells.
conclusions: report demonstrates oncolytic measles virotherapy in
combination apd-1 blockade significantly improves survival outcome a
syngeneic gbm model supports potential clinical/translational
strategies combining mv αpd-1 therapy gbm treatment.
