retroviruses enveloped viruses assemble inner leaflet cellular
membranes. improving biophysical techniques recently unveiled many molecular 
aspects interaction retroviral structural protein gag 
cellular membrane lipids. interaction driven n-terminal matrix
domain protein, probably undergoes important structural
modifications process, could induce membrane lipid distribution
changes well. review aims describing molecular events occurring
during ma-membrane interaction, pointing consequences terms of
viral assembly. striking conservation matrix membrane binding mode
among retroviruses indicates particular step probably a
relevant target antiviral research.
