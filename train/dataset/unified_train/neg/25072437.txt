objective: compare prognostic factors outcomes hepatic resection
among patients hepatitis b virus (hbv)-positive, hepatitis c virus
(hcv)-positive, negative hepatitis b surface antigen hepatitis c
antibody, so-called "nbnc"-hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) using data a
nationwide survey.
background: incidence nbnc-hcc rapidly increasing japan.
methods: total 11,950 patients hbv-hcc (n = 2194), hcv-hcc (n = 7018), 
or nbnc-hcc (n = 2738) underwent curative hepatic resection enrolled
in study. clinicopathological features compared among groups.
the significant prognostic variables determined univariate analysis were
subjected multivariate analysis using cox proportional hazard regression
model.
results: liver function hcv-hcc group significantly worse in
the hbv-hcc nbnc-hcc groups. nbnc-hcc group significantly more
advanced hcc hcv-hcc group. 5-year overall survival rates after
hepatectomy hbv-hcc, hcv-hcc, nbnc-hcc groups 65%, 59%, 68%, 
respectively. 5-year recurrence-free survival (rfs) rates 3 groups
were 41%, 31%, 47%, respectively. stratifying rfs rates according 
tnm stage showed nbnc-hcc group significantly better prognosis
than hbv-hcc group stages ii, iii, iva, significantly better
prognosis hcv-hcc group stages ii. multivariate analysis
revealed significantly better rfs rate nbnc-hcc group.
conclusions: findings nationwide survey indicated patients 
nbnc-hcc significantly lower risk hcc recurrence hbv-hcc
and hcv-hcc.
