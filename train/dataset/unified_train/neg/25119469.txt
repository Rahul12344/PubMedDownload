human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection remains significant cause of
mortality globally. though antiretroviral therapy significantly reduced
aids-related morbidity mortality, several drawbacks current 
therapy, including toxicity, drug-drug interactions, development drug
resistance, necessity long-term drug therapy, poor bio-availability lack 
of access tissues reservoirs. circumvent problems, recent
anti-hiv therapeutic research focused improving drug delivery systems
through drug delivery targeted specifically host cells infected hiv or
could potentially get infected hiv. regard, several surface
molecules viral host cell origin described recent years,
that would enable targeted drug delivery hiv infection. present review,
we provide comprehensive overview need novel drug delivery systems, 
and successes challenges identification novel viral and
host-cell molecules targeted drug delivery anti-hiv drugs. such
targeted anti-retroviral drug delivery approaches could pave way for
effective treatment eradication hiv body.
