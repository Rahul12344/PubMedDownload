about 45% rotavirus sa11 vp3 gene inserted thermoinducible
expression plasmid control phage lambda pl promoter. primary
translation product predicted basis plasmid construction a
hybrid protein 98 amino-terminal amino acids phage ms2 polymerase
were followed amino acids 42 387 vp3 protein, included the
region containing cleavage sites associated trypsin enhancement of
infectivity. induction, polypeptide expected mol. wt. and
contained vp3-related amino acid sequences judged immunological criteria,
was synthesized level representing 15% total bacterial protein.
when bacterial lysate enriched fusion polypeptide injected into
mice, induced antibodies inhibited haemagglutination neutralized
sa11 rotavirus infectivity.
