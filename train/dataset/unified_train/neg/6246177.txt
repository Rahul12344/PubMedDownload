cell-mediated immunity varicella-zoster virus allogeneic marrow
transplant.

meyers jd, flournoy n, thomas ed.

the cellular immune response normal persons marrow transplant recipients
to varicella-zoster virus (vzv) antigen measured use lymphocyte
transformation response. ninety-nine 100 normal persons previous vzv
infection stimulation index greater equal 4.8, 10
susceptible persons responses less equal 3.0. before
transplant, responses lower normal patients leukemia relapse
(p = 0.001), patients leukemia remission aplastic
anemia. throughout first 100 days transplant, lymphocyte response was
depressed (p less 0.0005), especially among recipients antithymocyte
globulin days 41-80 (p less 0.05). patients aplastic anemia 
higher responses leukemia days 20-60 (p less 0.02).
by one year, responses normal. long-term survivors recurrent
vzv infection positive responses often without recurrent
infection (p = 0.01). lymphocyte response vzv antigen parelleled, thus
may predict, periods increased susceptibility vzv infection.
