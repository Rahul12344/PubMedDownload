background: taking pattern, t4 lambda viruses interacting 
other gram-negative host, escherichia coli, general model is
constructed evolution 'gentle' temperate pathogens. model is
not simply either pure group kin selection, probably common a
variety host-parasite pairs various taxonomic groups. proposed
mechanism benefit pathogen evolved ways protect its
host attack pathogens incidentally protected host.
although appropriate mechanisms would developed excluded related
viral species also quite different pathogens, important advance
would individuals species arrive the
host subsequent first infecting one excluded.
results: class mechanisms would compete one genotype another, 
but simply would benefit first pathogen attacked host
organism.
conclusion: would tend protect extend life host against
the detrimental effects secondarily infecting pathogen. leads the
pathogens becoming temperate via favorable co-evolution its
host, basically protects host virus pathogens but
may cause slowing growth primary infecting pathogen. evolution a
'gentle' strategy would favored long increased wellbeing host
also favored eventual transmission early infecting pathogen other
hosts.
