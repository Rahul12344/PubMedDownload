a viral disease identified geraniums (pelargonium spp.) grown a
greenhouse institute himalayan bioresource technology (ihbt), palampur,
exhibiting mild mottling stunting. causal virus (cucumber mosaic virus,
cmv) identified characterized basis host range, aphid
transmission, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), dna-rna hybridization
and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). complete coat
protein (cp) gene amplified using degenerate primers sequenced. cp
gene showed nucleotide amino acid homology 97%-98% 96%-99%,
respectively sequences cmv subgroup ii. cp gene also showed
homologies 75%-97% nucleotide 77%-96% amino acid cmv indian
isolates infecting various crops. basis sequence homology, was
concluded cmv-infecting geraniums india belong subgroup ii.
