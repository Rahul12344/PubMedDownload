the presence infectious bursal disease virus (ibdv) broilers entering
processing plants examined. dissemination ibdv introduction of
non-native strains example virulent (vv) ibdv negative
economic impact poultry production many countries. restrictions been
placed import export poultry products countries. a
perceived risk ibdv spread transportation contamination
of processing equipment, poultry protein products processing plant personnel.
this risk, however, fundamentally unknown scientific studies 
been conducted presence ibdv birds entering processing plants the
variables may affect risk post-harvest. goal this
study determine infectious ibdv present broilers entering
processing plants. total 47 pooled bursa samples 26 processing plants
in eastern u.s. examined. molecular testing indicated ibdv
specific rt-pcr positive 12 (25.5%) samples 11 different
processing plants. nucleotide sequence analysis conducted 12 rt-pcr
positive samples indicated ibdv commercially available attenuated
vaccine strains. sequences unique phylogenic analysis
indicated closely related variant strains ibdv. five rt-pcr 
positive samples selected random testing specific-pathogen-free
chickens. five samples contained infectious ibdv evidenced macroscopic 
lesions bursa/body weight ratios significantly lower infected
birds non-inoculated controls. five viruses re-identified in
bursa tissue chickens respective groups necropsy using rt-pcr
and nucleotide sequencing. results indicate infectious pathogenic
ibdv entering processing plants geographic region u.s.
additional studies needed post-harvest variables could increase or
decrease risk viruses disseminated process.
