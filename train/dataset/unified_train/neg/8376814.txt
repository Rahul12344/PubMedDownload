purified f glycoprotein respiratory syncytial virus (rsv, subgroup a
antigenic type) evaluated 18- 36-month-old children vaccine.
children previously infected rsv natural outbreaks the
virus. single injections 5, 20, 50 micrograms protein resulted in
greater eightfold increases elisa neutralizing antibodies. second
doses vaccine result boosts antibody. neutralizing
antibodies increased a2 long strains (subgroup strains) but
also strain 18537 (subgroup b). four 11 vaccinees became naturally infected
during subsequent rsv outbreak, suggesting vaccine effective
in preventing recurrent rsv infections. severe illnesses occur,
indicating increase severity infection following
vaccine seropositive children. 1 8 vaccinees tested fourfold
increases nasal wash iga rsv immunization. vaccine strategies to
stimulate secretory antibodies well circulating neutralizing antibodies 
rsv need developed.
