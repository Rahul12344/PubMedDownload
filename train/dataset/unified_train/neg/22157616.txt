the simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) macaque model resembles human
immunodeficiency virus-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) associated
brain dysfunction. altered expression synaptic markers transmitters in
neuro-aids reported, limited data exist cholinergic system
and lipid mediators prostaglandins. here, analyzed cholinergic basal
forebrain neurons telencephalic projections rate-limiting
enzymes prostaglandin synthesis, cyclooxygenase isotypes 1 2 (cox1 and
cox2) brains siv-infected macaques without encephalitis and
antiretroviral therapy uninfected controls.cyclooxygenase isotype 1, 
cox2, coexpressed markers cholinergic phenotype, is, choline
acetyltransferase vesicular acetylcholine transporter (vacht), basal
forebrain neurons monkey, well human, brain. cyclooxygenase isotype 1
was decreased basal forebrain neurons macaques aids versus uninfected 
and asymptomatic siv-infected macaques. vacht-positive fiber density was
reduced frontal, parietal, hippocampal-entorhinal cortex. although brain
siv burden associated cox1- cox2-positive mononuclear endothelial
inflammatory reactions mostly reversed aids-diseased macaques that
received 6-chloro-2',3'-dideoxyguanosine treatment, decreased vacht-positive
terminal density reduced cholinergic cox1 expression not. thus, cox1
expression feature primate cholinergic basal forebrain neurons; may be
functionally important critical biomarker cholinergic dysregulation
accompanying lentiviral encephalopathy. results imply that
insufficiently prompt initiation antiretroviral therapy lentiviral
infection may lead neurostructurally unremarkable neurochemically
prominent irreversible brain damage.
