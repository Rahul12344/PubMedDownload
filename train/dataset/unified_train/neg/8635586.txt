the role glycans mature human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) envelope
(gp160) stability various conditions studied. gp160 conformation
was monitored subsequent ability bind [125i]cd4. treatment of
glycosylated (cho+) gp160 (i) sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) concentrations
above 0.01% impaired subsequent cd4 binding 0.3% sds abolished it; (ii)
beta-mercaptoethanol (msh) concentrations 0.01% impaired cd4 binding 
0.03% msh abolished it; (iii) 2 guanidine-hcl effect; (iv) temperatures 
between 50 degrees c 80 degrees c altered cd4 binding while, 80 degrees
c, binding abolished; (v) cd4 binding decreased 50% 2
freeze-thaw cycles affected subsequent (up 15) cycles; 
(vi) gp160 incubation serum cell lysate effect cd4 binding.
glycanase treated (cho-) gp160 binding activity 3-fold lower that
of cho+ gp160. 2 guanidine-hcl heating 70 degrees c differentially 
affected binding cho+ cho- gp160, effects larger cho-
gp160. cho- gp160 binding impaired incubation either serum cell
lysate. thus, glycans stabilize gp160 conformation environments. however,
cho- gp160 appears resistant denaturation compared other
glycoproteins reported literature.
