objective: observe changes activity dendritic cells (dcs) 
carcino-embryonic antigen (cea) gene transfection mediated recombinant
adeno-associated virus type2 (raav) tumor cell lysate.
methods: immature dcs isolated peripheral blood monocytes of
hla-a11-positive healthy volunteers infected raav carrying cea gene
or loaded tumor cell lysate. surface markers dcs cd40, cd
1alpha, cd86 analyzed flow cytometry. interleukin-12 (il-12) the
supernatants dcs interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) released cytotoxic 
lymphocytes (ctls) determined elisa detection kit. specific killing
activity ctl lovo cells assessed mtt assay.
results: dcs following antigen loading two methods highly
expressed cd40, cd86 il-12, induced specific ctl specifically
recognized killed lovo cells, killing effect resulting raav
infection dcs much better induced tumor cell lysate
loading.
conclusion: methods antigen loading induce mature dcs peripheral
blood monocyte cells, raav infection dcs effective than
tumor cells lysate loading. dcs infected raav may potential to
serve adjuvant immunotherapy patients colorectal carcinoma.
