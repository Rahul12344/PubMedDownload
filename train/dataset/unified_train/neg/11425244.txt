hypermethylation important mechanism repression tumor gene
suppressor cancer. drug 5'-azacytidine (azc) used as
demethylating agent induce expression previously silencing genes. in
the present work, attempted determine, using proteomics, changes in
protein expression profiles following treatment epstein barr virus
(ebv)-negative burkitt lymphoma (bl) cell line dg 75. effects the
treatment terms cell viability growth first examined. the
following observations made: azc treatment led (i) decrease cell
growth arrest cell g0/g1 phase cell cycle, (ii) the
expression p16, tumor-suppressor gene whose expression dependent 
promoter demethylation. proteomic study evidenced azc treatment affected
protein expression two different ways. twenty-one polypeptides were
down-expressed, 14 showed increased expression. upregulated 
proteins appeared related energy metabolism, organization of
cytoskeletal structures, cell viability protein synthesis. also
established reference map proteins dg 75 cell line, comprising 74
different polypeptides corresponding 67 proteins. map accessible 
via internet resource proteome analyses b-cells. taken together, 
results presented highlight new insights lymphoma cell gene regulations
following treatment lymphoma cells azc illustrate use of
proteomics evidence direct indirect effects drug pathways
it possibly regulates.
