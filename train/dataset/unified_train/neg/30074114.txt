classical philadelphia- negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (mpns) encompass
three main myeloid malignancies: polycythemia vera (pv), essential
thrombocythemia (et), myelofibrosis (mf). phenotype-driver mutations janus
kinase 2 (jak2), calreticulin (calr), myeloproliferative leukemia virus
oncogene (mpl) genes mutually exclusive occur variable frequency. 
driver mutations influence disease phenotype prognosis. pv patients jak2
exon 14 mutation differ number thrombotic events, risk leukemic
and fibrotic transformation, overall survival jak2 exon 12
mutation. type 2-like calr-mutated et patients lower risk thrombosis if
compared carrying jak2 type 1-like calr mutation. et, overall
survival comparable patients jak2 either type 1-like type
2-like calr mutations. mf, better os demonstrated patients harboring a
type 1-like calr mutation type 2-like calr jak2. discovery
of driver mutations mpns prompted development molecularly targeted 
therapy. among jak2 inhibitors, ruxolitinib (rux) approved (1)
treatment intermediate-2 high-risk mf (2) pv patients are
resistant intolerant hydroxyurea. rux reduces spleen size alleviates
disease symptoms proportion mf patients. rux mf leads prolonged
survival reduces risk death. rux controls hematocrit, reduces spleen size 
and alleviates symptoms pv. adverse events rux moderate, however, its
long-term use may associated opportunistic infections. trials 
jak2 inhibitors ongoing.
