methylated reovirus vesicular stomatitis virus mrnas, synthesized vitro in
the presence s-adenosylmethionine virion-associated polymerases (rna
nucleotidyltransferases, ec 2.7.7.6), stimulate protein synthesis wehat germ
extracts greater extent unmethylated mrnas. addition of
s-adenosylmethionine cell-free extract programmed unmethylated mrna
stimulates protein synthesis results methylation mrna. inhibitor
of mrna methylation. s-adenosylhomocysteine, blocks translation unmethylated, 
but methylated, mrnas. aurintricarboxylic acid, inhibits
polypepetide chain initiation, also prevents mrna methylation wheat germ
extracts. contrast, sparsomycin, inhibits polypeptide chain elongation, 
does reduce mrna methylation. results indicate methylation viral 
mrna required translation vitro suggest mrna methylation
occurs initiation step protein synthesis.
