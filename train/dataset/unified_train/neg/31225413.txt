backgrounds/aims: study intended evaluate patient safety efficiency
of facility utilization following simplified ultra-rapid intravenous infusion 
hepatitis b immunoglobulin (hbig) recipients hepatitis b virus-associated
adult liver transplantation (lt), visited outpatient clinic.
methods: simplified ultra-rapid infusion protocol directly infuse 50
ml volume 10,000 iu hbig 20-25 minutes ambulatory basis. the
incidence adverse side-effects efficiency facility utilization were
assessed retrospectively.
results: total 1,513 patients received 12,472 sessions hbig infusion
according simplified ultra-rapid infusion method. these, 1,172 patients
were converted conventional ultra-rapid infusion method, received 8,352 
sessions hbig infusion 18 months (mean 7.1 times; 4.8 times per year). the
remaining 341 de novo patients received 4,120 sessions hbig infusion 18
months (mean 12.1 times; 8.1 times per year). none patients experienced 
any adverse side-effects following simplified ultra-rapid infusion. the
maximal capacity hbig infusion sessions injection facility our
outpatient clinic increased 65-70 sessions 80 sessions, after
introduction simplified ultra-rapid infusion method. mean trough anti-hbs
titer lower, mean interval hbig infusion longer combination
therapy group compared hbig monotherapy group.
conclusions: high-volume study indicates nearly lt recipients,
rapid infusion highly purified hbig within 30 minutes well-tolerated. this
suggests would reasonable perform simplified ultra-rapid infusion
protocol widely patient convenience.
