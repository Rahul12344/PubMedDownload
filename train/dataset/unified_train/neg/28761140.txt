combination anti-retroviral therapy (cart) drastically improved clinical 
outcome hiv-1 infection. nonetheless, despite effective cart, hiv-1 persists
indefinitely infected individuals. clonal expansion hiv-1-infected cells in
peripheral blood reported recently. cart effective stopping the
retroviral replication cycle, inhibiting clonal expansion the
infected host cells. thus, proliferation hiv-1-infected cells may play a
role viral persistence, little known kinetics the
generation, tissue distribution underlying mechanism clonal
expansion vivo. analyzed clonality hiv-1-infected cells using
high-throughput integration site analysis hematopoietic stem
cell-transplanted humanized mouse model. clonally expanded, hiv-1-infected cells 
were detectable two weeks post infection, abundance increased time,
and certain clones present multiple organs. expansion hiv-1-infected
clones significantly frequent provirus integrated near host
genes specific gene ontological classes, including cell activation and
chromatin regulation. results identify potential drivers clonal
expansion hiv-1-infected cells vivo.
