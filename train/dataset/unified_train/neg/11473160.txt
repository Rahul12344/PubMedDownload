purpose: identify changing trends penetrating keratoplasties (pks)
performed hotel-dieu hospital paris january 1980 december
1999 explain reasons changes.
methods: retrospectively reviewed 3,736 3,836 pks performed between
january 1, 1980, december 31, 1999, classified diagnostic
categories.
results: common indications pk keratoconus (28.8%), herpetic
infections (10.9%), graft failures (9.9%), aphakic pseudophakic corneal edema
(9.9%), fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (9.4%), nonherpetic leucoma (7.7%).
other indications represented 23.4% cases. incidence aphakic and
pseudophakic corneal edema progressively increased 1980 1991, became 
the frequent indication 1991 (21.4%), progressively decreased.
the annual number pks increased 1980 1986, decreased 1987 
and 1997, increased september 1997. decrease caused by
both shortage corneal buttons, and, 1987, fear transmitting
diseases corneal transplantation, particularly human immunodeficiency
virus. beginning 1992, decreases also associated stringent
governmental regulations eye bank tissue.
conclusion: changes incidence management corneal disorders the
primary factors leading modifications grafting 1987. 1987,
corneal button shortage probably corresponded acquired immune deficiency
syndrome epidemic. governmental regulations eye banking led severe
corneal button shortage 1992 1997. despite increase number 
of pks performed 1997, corneal buttons still preferentially allocated
to patients high probability graft success.
