current efforts improve effectiveness vaccines include incorporating
antimicrobial peptides mixed virus. antimicrobial peptide, epinecidin 
(epi)-1, reported antiviral function, epi-1-based
inactivated vaccine postulated model discussed. report, we
demonstrated modulation immune responses epi-1 epi-1-based japanese 
encephalitis virus (jev)-inactivated vaccine jev infection mice. under
in vitro conditions, epi-1 prevented jev infection-mediated loss cell
viability bhk-21 cells. epi-1 jev co-injected mice mice
were re-challenged jev 14 days, mice survived. addition, epi-1 
modulated expressions immune-responsive genes like interleukin (il)-6,
il-10, mcp-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ il-12, elevated the
levels anti-jev-neutralizing antibodies serum. presence epi-1
suppressed multiplication jev brain sections 4 days an
injection. mice immunized developed vaccine showed complete survival
against jev infection, superior traditional formalin-based
jev-inactivated vaccine. study demonstrates use epi-1 develop an
inactivated vaccine provide guidelines future design epi-1-virus
formulations various vivo applications.
