cyprinid herpesvirus ii (cyhv-2) highly contagious pathogenic carassius
auratus gibelio (gibel carp), causing enormous economic losses aquaculture 
yancheng city, jiangsu province, china; however, date, effective
way protect c. auratus gibelio cyhv-2 infection. study, a
recombinant baculovirus vector vaccine, baccarassius-d4orfs, containing fused
codon-optimized sequence d4orfs comprising orf72 (region 1-186 nt), orf66
(region 993-1197 nt), orf81 (region 603-783 nt) orf82 (region 85-186 nt)
genes cyhv-2, driven megalobrama amblycephala β-actin promoter, was
constructed. then, qpcr, western blotting immunofluorescence assays showed
that fused gene d4orfs successfully delivered expressed fish cells
or tissues transduction baccarassius-d4orfs. fused gene d4orfs could 
not detected pcr c. auratus gibelio injected with
baccarassius-d4orfs 7 weeks. specific antibody orf72 could be
detected serum vaccinated c. auratus gibelio injection with
baccarassius-d4orfs. furthermore, c. auratus gibelio vaccinated with
baccarassius-d4orfs via oral injection route, followed challenge with
cyhv-2, relative survival rate immunized c. auratus gibelio reached 59.3% 
and 80.01%, respectively. results suggested baccarassius-d4orfs has
the potential used vector-based vaccine prevention and
treatment disease caused cyhv-2 infection.
