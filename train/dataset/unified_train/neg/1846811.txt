simian virus 40 large antigen helicase separating complementary
strands double-stranded dna presence hydrolyzable atp of
double-stranded rna presence non-atp nucleotides (gtp, ctp utp). 
have constructed partially single-stranded nucleic acid substrates consisting 
rna dna strands hydrogen bonded either rna dna complements. found
that atp utilized cofactor t-antigen-catalyzed unwinding reaction
when substrates contain overhanging single-stranded dna, regardless of
whether double-stranded region dna hybrid dna.rna. conversely, non-atp 
nucleotides used overhanging single strand rna. based these
and additional findings, propose bound nucleic acid induces a
conformational change antigen resulting proper orientation both
nucleic acid nucleotide relative active center atpase/helicase 
domain enzyme. implications conclusion roles t
antigen may play vivo discussed.
