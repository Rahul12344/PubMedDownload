many viruses overlapping genes and/or regions nucleic acid signal
is embedded coding sequence. search dual-use regions hepatitis
c virus (hcv), developed facile computer-based sequence analysis method to
map dual-use regions coding sequences. eight diverse full-length hcv rna and
polyprotein sequences aligned analyzed. cluster unusually conserved
synonymous codons found core-encoding region, indicating potential
overlapping open reading frame (orf). four peptides (a1, a2, a3, a4)
representing alternate reading frame protein (arfp), two others hcv
core protein, one bovine serum albumin (bsa) conjugated bsa 
used western blots test sera specific antibodies 100 chronic hcv
patients, 44 healthy controls, 60 patients non-hcv liver disease. a
1:20,000 dilution, specific iggs three four arfp peptides detected
in chronic hcv sera. reactivity either a1 a3 peptides (both arfp
derived) significantly associated chronic hcv infection, compared
to non-hcv liver disease serum samples (10/100 versus 1/60; p < 0.025).
antibodies a4 detected serum sample. western blot assays
confirmed presence specific antibodies new hcv antigen encoded, at
least part, alternate reading frame (arf) overlapping core-encoding 
region. novel hcv protein stimulates specific immune responses, it
has potential value diagnostic tests component vaccines. this
protein predicted highly basic may play role hcv replication,
pathogenesis, carcinogenesis.
