escherichia coli common cause meningitis sepsis newborn
infant, large majority isolates infections produce a
polysialic acid (psa) capsular polysaccharide, k1 antigen, protects 
bacterial cell immune attack. determined whether capsule-depolymerizing
enzyme, removing protective barrier, could alter outcome systemic 
infection animal model. bacteriophage-derived endosialidase e (endoe)
selectively degrades psa capsule surface e. coli k1 strains.
intraperitoneal administration small quantities recombinant endoe (20 micro
g) 3-day-old rats, colonized virulent strain k1, prevented
bacteremia death systemic infection. enzyme effect the
viability e. coli strains sensitized strains expressing psa killing 
the complement system. study demonstrates potential therapeutic efficacy
of agents cure infections modification bacterial phenotype rather 
than killing inhibition growth pathogen.
