analysis hiv-1 v3 quasispecies present individual time of
seroconversion carried out. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) used to
amplify proviral hiv-1 dna extracted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
a patient viraemic (p24 = 15 pg/ml) equivocal hiv-1 antibody
status. pcr products cloned dna sequence determined 15
clones. data showed v3 region contained limited sequence
heterogeneity major variant accounting 66% protein quasispecies
present. protein sequence principal neutralising domain species
contained relatively rare gpgktl motif rather gpgraf. relevance of
these data early stages hiv infection discussed.
