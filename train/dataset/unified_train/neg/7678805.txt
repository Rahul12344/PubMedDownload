vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) angiogenic growth factor a
target-cell specificity highly restricted vascular endothelial cells.
recombinant baculovirus constructed production two different
forms human vegf protein insect cells. vegf165 vegf121 proteins
produced sf158 cells underwent similar processing compared mammalian
cells, including efficient glycosylation, formation disulfide-linked dimer
and secretion media. one forms, vegf165 high
affinity heparin characteristic used purify form to
homogenicity two-step heparin-affinity chromatography. biological
activity purified 43-kda homodimer demonstrated high-affinity
binding vegf receptors, induction dna synthesis vascular
endothelial cells. positive angiogenic activity vivo demonstrated the
day-13 chorioallantoic-membrane assay. mitogenic potency vegf121 human
umbilical vein endothelial cells similar compared vegf165. these
results demonstrate angiogenic growth factor whose normal processing
requires glycosylation disulfide-bridge formation efficiently
expressed high concentration (up 5 micrograms/ml) insects cells.
