amyloid fibrils contained semen, known sevi, semen-derived enhancer of
viral infection, shown increase infectivity hiv dramatically.
however, previous work fibrils suggested extensive time and
nonphysiologic levels agitation necessary induce amyloid formation from
the precursor peptide (a proteolytic cleavage product prostatic acid
phosphatase, pap(248-286)). here, show fibril formation pap(248-286)
is accelerated dramatically presence seminal plasma (sp) that
agitation required fibrillization setting. analysis the
effects specific sp components fibril formation pap(248-286) revealed
that effect primarily due anionic buffer components sp (notably
inorganic phosphate sodium bicarbonate). divalent cations present sp had
little effect kinetics fibril formation, physiologic levels of
zn(2+) strongly protected sevi fibrils degradation seminal proteases.
taken together, data suggest vivo environment, pap(248-286) 
is likely form fibrils efficiently, thus providing explanation the
presence sevi human semen.
