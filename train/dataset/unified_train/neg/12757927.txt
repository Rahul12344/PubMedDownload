binding('tagging') virus-specific oligonucleotide 'sticker' rna
transcripts copied pcr products caused retardation transcript mobility in
gel. enables detection specific sequences within rna transcripts, and
a virus strain (pvy(ntn)) could thus positively identified. have
demonstrated oligonucleotides contained virus sequences
originated different genomic locations varied inhibitory effect 
the rate transcript migration gel; thus, effective oligonucleotide
could chosen. combinations different strain-specific oligonucleotides had
additive retarding effects transcript migration. conditions annealing 
oligonucleotides rna transcripts studied, including concentrations of
oligonucleotides salt. higher electrophoresis temperature (up 45 degrees
c) reduced gel retardation phenomena, indicated conformation
mechanism. applicability 'tagging' rna transcripts a
strain-specific oligonucleotide virus strain differentiation discussed.
