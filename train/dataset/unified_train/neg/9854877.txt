there still consensus hepatitis b virus (hbv) immunisation option 
should adopted united kingdom (uk). review considers three
recent uk studies subject reached different conclusions, whether 
provide sufficient information base informed decision cost-effectiveness
grounds. studies differed methodology, particularly models used 
estimate effectiveness competing programmes. led authors to
draw different conclusions relative cost-effectiveness of
universal infant selective immunisation, probably study that
favoured infant immunisation omitted allowance indirect protection
afforded others immunisation proportion population. would 
lead underestimation relative effectiveness programme targeted
at high-risk individuals. selective vaccination probably cost-effective
than mass immunisation, universal immunisation may still considered a
cost-effective option (in addition selective immunisation) future health
benefits discounted (i.e., given lower value present ones). if
future health benefits discounted mass infant immunisation almost
certainly cost-effective. selective immunisation adopted, then
the current (selective) strategy properly implemented, appears to
have little impact hbv infection disease.
