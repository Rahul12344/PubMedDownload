pml organizer cellular structures termed nuclear domain 10 (nd10) or
pml-nuclear bodies (pml-nbs) act key mediators intrinsic immunity
against human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) viruses. antiviral function of
nd10 antagonized viral regulatory proteins immediate early
protein ie1 hcmv. ie1 interacts pml globular core domain
(ie1core) induces nd10 disruption order initiate lytic hcmv infection. 
here, investigate consequences point mutation (l174p) ie1core,
which shown abrogate interaction pml, lytic hcmv infection.
we found recombinant hcmv encoding ie1-l174p displays severe growth
defect similar ie1 deletion virus. bioinformatic modeling based 
the crystal structure ie1core suggested insertion proline the
highly alpha-helical domain severely affects structural integrity.
consistently, l174p mutation abrogates functionality ie1core results
in degradation ie1 protein infection. addition, data provide
evidence ie1core expressed recombinant hcmv encoding ie1 1-382 not
only required antagonize pml-mediated intrinsic immunity also affects a
recently described function pml innate immune signaling. demonstrate a
coregulatory role pml type type ii interferon-induced gene expression
and provide evidence upregulation interferon-induced genes inhibited
by ie1core. conclusion, data suggest targeting pml viral
regulatory proteins represents strategy antagonize intrinsic innate
immune mechanisms.importance: pml nuclear bodies (pml-nbs), represent
nuclear multiprotein complexes consisting pml additional proteins,
represent important cellular structures mediate intrinsic resistance against
many viruses, including human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). hcmv infection, 
major immediate early protein ie1 binds pml via central globular domain
(ie1core), shown previously sufficient antagonize
intrinsic immunity. here, demonstrate modification pml ie1core 
only abrogates intrinsic defense mechanisms also attenuates interferon
response infection. data show pml plays novel coregulatory role
in type well type ii interferon-induced gene expression, is
antagonized ie1core. importantly, finding supports view targeting
of pml-nbs viral regulatory proteins evolved strategy inhibit both
intrinsic innate immune defense mechanisms.
