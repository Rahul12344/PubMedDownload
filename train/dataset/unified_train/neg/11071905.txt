a hemagglutinin (ha) influenza virus single semiconserved gly residue
within transmembrane domain mutated leu (g520l) expressed cells;
these cells bound red blood cells. decreasing ph 23 degrees c
rather 37 degrees c, intermediate properties expected hemifusion 
just membranes transit full fusion captured. as
evidence: 1) increasing temperature 37 degrees c neutral ph allowed fusion 
to proceed; 2) achieving intermediate, two membranes not
separate proteolytic cleavage g520l cells
treated proteinase k could fuse upon temperature increase could fuse
upon addition chlorpromazine; 3) point intermediate,
adding exogenous lipids known promote inhibit creation hemifusion
did significantly alter lipid dye spread occurred upon increasing
temperature, implying intermediate, contacting membrane leaflets 
already merged. stable intermediate hemifusion could transit fusion 
was also generated wild-type ha, ph reduced the
significantly lower temperature 4 degrees c. fusion pores generated by
g520l enlarge, whereas induced wild-type ha did. finding
that state transitional hemifusion readily obtained via point
mutation without need unusually low temperature supports hypothesis
that hemifusion occurs pore formation.
