a transcript containing long terminal repeat (ltr) sequence
homologous kiaa1245 mrna fragment revealed among transcribed ltrs
of human endogenous viruses k family normal tumor tissues. ten
other sequences high level homology kiaa1245 mrna found 
the genbank. intron-exon structures determined sequences,
and exon sequences compared. comparison showed differ
both extent exon homology presence absence the
herv-k ltr third intron. revealed sequences form new gene family
that comprises least four subfamilies. two subfamilies ltr, 
and two not. showed pcr ltr integrated the
introns divergence orangutan evolutionary branch other
hominoids divergence gorilla branch, i.e., 8-13 million
