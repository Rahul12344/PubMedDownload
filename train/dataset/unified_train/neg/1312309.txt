cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection associated development of
accelerated arteriosclerosis heart transplant recipients. association
prompted authors examine, using situ hybridization techniques, the
coronary arteries 19 patients received heart transplants the
presence cmv nucleic acids. two probes employed formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tissues. first s35-labeled nick translated probe
derived cmv dna. cmv nucleic acids identified arterial intima of
5 (45%) 11 transplanted hearts examined probe. hybridization to
cells morphologically consistent endothelial cells, lymphocytes, smooth 
muscle cells identified. hybridization detected hearts 
when control probe, vector without cmv dna, employed. second probe
that used tritium-labeled strand-specific ribo-probe derived the
immediate early (ie1) gene cmv. using second probe, hybridization was
detected coronary arteries three five hearts positive with
the dna probe, one hearts negative dna probe, 
three (38%) eight additional transplanted hearts. pattern hybridization
was seen dna probe, hybridization detected
when control sense probe ie1 gene cmv employed. results
suggest cmv nucleic acids present coronary arteries heart
transplant recipients.
