background: rapid virologic response (rvr), defined undetectable serum
hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna level week 4 treatment, emerging an
important milestone treatment patients chronic hepatitis c 
use pegylated interferon-alfa ribavirin--the current standard care.
this assessment used individualize treatment duration, is
currently recommended 48 weeks patients infected hcv genotype 1 (g1)
and 24 weeks infected hcv g2 g3.
methods: collated information studies including assessment hcv rna
level week 4, specifically highlighting relationship rvr other
predictors treatment outcome manner rvr used to
optimize treatment outcomes specific patient groups.
results: role rvr treatment patients chronic hepatitis c
varies according viral genotype. among patients hcv g2/g3 infection,
several studies shown shortening treatment duration 12-16 weeks 
is effective among attain rvr. contrast, rvr may used an
indicator shortened extended treatment durations among patients with
hcv g1 infection. hcv g1-infected patients low baseline viral load who
attain rvr may effectively treated 24 weeks, whereas patients not
attain rvr may candidates extended 72-week regimen.
conclusions: rvr rapidly becoming new tool predicting treatment outcomes
in patients chronic hepatitis c represents key opportunity to
individualize therapy according treatment-related viral kinetics.
