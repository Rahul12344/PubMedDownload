background: worldwide, healthcare workers (hcws) show different levels of
response hepatitis b virus (hbv) vaccine. one factors associated with
vaccine unresponsiveness may existence current past hbv infection.
regardless presence hbsag (overt infection), occult hbv infection (obi,
defined presence hbv dna absence hbsag) might also account for
some non- hypo-response cases.
methods: sera 120 hbsag-negative hcws low moderate levels of
anti-hbs, <10 iu/ml (group i) <100 iu/ml (group ii) respectively, were
selected examined obi sensitive real-time pcr regardless hbv
serological profiles. direct sequencing surface genes carried in
obi-positive cases.
results: four (3.3%) positive obi. negative anti-hbc. two
of positive cases moderate levels anti-hbs (>10 <100 iu/ml). no
significant differences found two groups terms risk
factors serological data. mutations found surface proteins obi
cases.
conclusion: obi subjects might due factors rather than
presence "a" determinant mutations. healthcare workers inadequate to
moderate levels anti-hbs (<100 iu/ml) following vaccination, regardless of
their serological profile hbv, tested presence hbv dna
by sensitive molecular tests. anti-hbc reliable marker suspicion 
obi, especially high-risk group individuals.
