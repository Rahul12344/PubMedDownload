turnip yellow mosaic virus (tymv) positive strand rna virus infects
mainly cruciferae plants. study, tymv genome modified by
inserting extra subgenomic rna promoter multiple cloning site. this
modified tymv introduced nicotiana benthamiana using a
agrobacterium-mediated t-dna transfer system (agroinfiltration). gene
encoding beta-glucuronidase green fluorescent protein expressed using this
modified tymv vector, replication recombinant viruses, especially the
virus containing beta-glucuronidase gene, severely inhibited. suppression
of replication reduced co-expression viral silencing suppressor genes, 
such tombusviral p19, closteroviral p21 potyviral hc-pro. expected, two 
subgenomic rnas produced recombinant tymv, larger one
contained foreign gene. rnase protection assay revealed the
recombinant subgenomic rna encapsidated efficiently genuine
subgenomic rna.
