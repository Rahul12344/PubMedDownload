secretory immune response intestinal mucosa salivary gland after
experimental infection pigs transmissible gastroenteritis virus.

debuysscher ev, berman dt.

pigs 8 10 weeks age orally infected transmissible gastroenteritis
(tge) virus infected inoculation virus thirty-vella loops of
jejunum. concentrations immunoglobulin (ig) a, igm, igg serum, saliva, 
jejunal secretions, loop secretions, bile determined solid-phase
radioimmunoassay tge virus-infected control pigs. multiple-staining
fluorescent antibody technique used determine relative numbers of
iga-, igm-, igg-producing plasma cells intestinal mucosa, mesenteric lymph
node, spleen, iliac lymph node, submandibular salivary gland. numbers 
iga- igm-producing plasma cells greater jejunal mucosa pigs
infected reinfected orally tge virus control pigs.
there also increase iga- probably igm-cells submandibular
salivary glands. similar numerical increases iga- igm-cells observed 
in jejunal mucosa salivary glands pigs intestinal loops whether
exposed tge virus not. increases plasma cells mucosa salivary
gland associated increases concentrations iga igm the
respective secretions serum. data support hypothesis after
stimulation, iga- igm-producing cells leave intestinal mucosa are
trapped distant secretory epithelial. absence simultaneous increased 
concentration iga igm saliva intestinal secretions indicates that
in intact epithelium, transport iga igm mediated secretory
component probably saturable.
