shaggy-like protein kinase (sk) plays important roles plant growth
development, signal transduction, abiotic stress biotic stress substance 
metabolism regulation. however, exact function response drought
stress mulberry sk remains unclear. study, new sk gene was
designated mmsk (genbank accession no: ky348867) isolated cloned 
mulberry (morus alba). mmsk contains two sk conservation domains atp domain
and serine/threonine protein kinases active-site signature, belonged to
gsk3/shaggy protein kinase family. expression mmsk mulberry was
up-regulated various abiotic stress treatments. meanwhile, observed
higher expression levels phloem contrasted tissues. mulberry
mmsk gene successfully silenced virus induced gene silencing (vigs), and
after mmsk silenced, expression mmsk ptrv2-mmsk-vigs plant
(transgenic mulberry) dropped 34.02% compared negative control
inoculated empty vector ptrv2-00 (ck). drought stress, soluble
protein content, proline content, superoxide dismutase (sod) peroxidase (pod)
activities transgenic mulberry decreased different degree compared the
ck. contrast, accumulation malondialdehyde (mda) increased
significantly transgenic mulberry. extension drought stress
treatment time, soluble protein content, proline content mda content
gradually increased. sod activity pod activity drought stress
gradually rose maximum fifth day decreased, which
consistent change trend mmsk gene expression. results suggested
that mmsk gene could function positive regulator drought stress in
mulberry.
