hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection prevalent throughout world and
interferon (ifn)-based treatments currently therapeutic option.
however, depending upon variations human leukocyte antigen (hla), some
patients respond well ifn therapy. current study evaluated hla 
allele haplotype distribution 204 hcv-seropositive individuals from
islamabad, pakistan, receiving standard ifn therapy. cohort, 150
patients (74%) showed sustained virological response ifn therapy, whereas 54
(26%) not. addition hcv patients, 102 unrelated healthy volunteers 
were used controls. dna isolated blood patients and
controls hla-drb1 hla-dqb1 allele typing, whilst plasma used hcv 
detection genotyping. hla-drb1*04 found impart significant
protective advantage [bonferroni-corrected p value (pc)=0.047] hcv
infection. patients ifn therapy, hla-drb1*11 -dqb1*0301 (pc=0.044) were
found associated viral clearance. contrast, hla-drb1*07 (pc=0.008) 
individually combination hla-dqb1*02 found associated with
viral persistence. associations hla hcv persistence clearance
will beneficial deciding therapeutic regimen pakistani patients
infected hcv genotype 3a.
