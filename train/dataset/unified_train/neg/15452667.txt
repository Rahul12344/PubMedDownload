staurosporine, inhibitor protein kinase c, potential antitumor drug
and derivatives used anticancer drugs clinical trials. human
herpesvirus 8 (hhv-8) implicated forms kaposi's sarcoma (ks),
primary effusion lymphoma (pel), multicentric castleman's disease (mcd),
indicating dna tumor virus. difficult culture cell lines
derived ks patients; therefore used cell line derived pel (bcbl-1)
to investigate whether staurosporine affects hhv-8-related tumors. our
results show staurosporine treatment reduces cell viability bcbl-1
cells causes cell cycle arrest g2/m phase. g2/m arrest was
associated decrease expression cdc2 cyclin b. furthermore,
the induction hhv-8 lytic cycle observed staurosporine
treatment.
