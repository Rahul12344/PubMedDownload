since introduction, hepatotoxicity associated use of
human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 protease inhibitors (pis). however, the
complexity hiv-infected patient combinations medications used
to treat hiv complicate understanding independent effects pis in
the development drug-induced liver injury (dili). discuss current
understanding pi-associated hepatotoxicity. pi regimens studied, the
greatest risk dili observed among patients receiving full-dose
ritonavir. similarly, hepatitis b and/or c virus coinfection associated 
with greater risk dili, compared hepatitis. although 
specific mechanism viral hepatitis increases risk known,
patients cirrhosis may decreased cytochrome p450 activity, leading to
increased pi exposure. clearly, research needed define the
interaction pis chronic viral hepatitis development dili.
