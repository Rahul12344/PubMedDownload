a baculoviral mammalian-cell vector constructed express rta, protein 
epstein-barr virus (ebv) responsible transition latent infection 
lytic replication. ebv lytic replication cell-growth inhibition observed 
in infected d98/hr1 cells. baculovirus caused little cytotoxicity the
non-targeted hela cells, compared adenovirus vector. concluded that
recombinant baculovirus might potential vector therapy of
ebv-related cancer.
