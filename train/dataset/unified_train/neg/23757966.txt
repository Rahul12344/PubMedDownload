objective: investigate father-to-infant transmission hepatitis b virus
(hbv) detecting hbv mrna ivf embryos paternal hbv infection.
methods: collected 18 discarded ivf embryos (9 cases) paternal chronic
hbv infection, detected hbv mrna embryos single-cell rt-pcr.
results: hbv mrna positive signals found 1 18 embryos with
paternal serum hbv positive markers (5.6%), specific hbv mrna signals were
observed 84 embryos negative control group. follow-up visits
revealed significant difference experimental negative control 
groups either rate clinical pregnancy (p > 0.05) early
abortion (p > 0.05). ivf embryo paternal hbv mrna positive signals was
successfully implanted, early abortion occurred. hbv infection not
transmitted progeny either two groups.
conclusion: positive results hbv mrna indicate hbv get into
early-cleavage embryos sperm replicate there, may main
channel father-to-infant transmission. hbv may interfere development 
of embryos, even result abortion adverse outcomes.
