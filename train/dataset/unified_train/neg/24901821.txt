objective: investigate phase 2a study (zenith) safety,
tolerability, antiviral activity vx-222, selective, non-nucleoside
inhibitor hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5b polymerase, combined various
telaprevir-based regimens treatment genotype 1 hcv.
methods: total, 152 treatment-naive patients received vx-222+telaprevir
('dual' regimen; n=47), ribavirin ('triple' regimen; n=46), with
peginterferon+ribavirin ('quad' regimen; n=59) 12 weeks. patients with
detectable hcv rna weeks 2 and/or 8 received peginterferon+ribavirin 24
(dual triple) 12 (quad) additional weeks.
results: vx-222 (100 400 mg twice daily) well tolerated, increased
rate gastrointestinal adverse events observed higher dose. across
vx-222 400-mg twice-daily regimens, quad associated highest
frequency grade 3/4 adverse events. dual discontinued high 
viral breakthrough week 12. sustained virologic response (svr) 24 weeks
after end treatment (svr24), including patients treated 12 24
additional weeks peginterferon+ribavirin, 67% triple (vx-222 400 mg
twice daily) 79 90% quad (vx-222 100 400 mg twice daily,
respectively).
conclusion: results provide valuable information regarding safety,
tolerability, efficacy telaprevir combined non-nucleoside
polymerase inhibitor, dual therapy ribavirin without with
peginterferon. telaprevir vx-222, alone ribavirin without with
peginterferon, generally well tolerated, improved tolerability without 
peginterferon. svr24 rates achieved triple quad regimens containing
telaprevir vx-222 comparable observed telaprevir-based
therapy.
