introduction: multiple sclerosis important disabling neurological
disease young adulthood environment. however, etiology remains
unknown. proposed multiple sclerosis caused interaction
of genetic environmental factors. particular, epstein-barr virus infection
could play fundamental role pathophysiology multiple sclerosis.
methods: reviewed recent important bibliography, from
epidemiologic basic research studies, dealing possible association
between epstein-barr virus infection multiple sclerosis.
results: retrospective prospective epidemiologic studies suggest direct
association epstein-barr virus infection risk multiple
sclerosis. several physiopathologic mechanisms, including molecular mimicry and
bystander activation, could responsible association.
conclusions: based published evidence, epstein-barr virus infection be
considered causal role etiology multiple sclerosis. further
research conducted elucidate mechanisms underlying this
association assess potential multiple sclerosis prevention and
treatment.
