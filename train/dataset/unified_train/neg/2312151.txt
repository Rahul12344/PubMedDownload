the pathogenic mechanism leading liver tissue injury hepatitis caused by
hepatitis virus unclear. randomly established t-cell clones from
liver biopsies four patients hepatitis a. total 578 clones was
phenotypically analysed. acute phase disease cd8+ clones
dominated cd4+ clones, whereas biopsy taken late onset of
clinical syndromes cd4+ cd8+ clones obtained. interestingly, 
patient second exacerbation disease, 20% clones
had cd3+ wt31- cd4- cd8- 'nk-like' phenotype. cd8+ clones cytotoxic
activity approximately 50% cd8+ clones showed specific cytotoxicity
against autologous fibroblasts infected hepatitis virus. cd8+ cells
also produced ifn-gamma response target cells. variable ifn-gamma
production observed types t-cell clones. results suggest
that liver injury hepatitis caused viral cytopathogenic
effect due immunopathological reaction sensitized cytotoxic t
lymphocytes infected hepatocytes. addition, studies show an
enrichment cd4-8-t-cell receptor alpha beta-chain-negative lymphocytes at
the site inflammation suggest role cells anti-viral
reaction.
