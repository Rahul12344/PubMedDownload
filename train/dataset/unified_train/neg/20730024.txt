the filoviruses, ebola marburg, utilize multifaceted mechanism assembly
and budding infectious virions mammalian cells. growing evidence only
demonstrates importance multiple viral proteins efficient assembly and
budding, also exploitation various host proteins/pathways virus
during late stage filovirus replication, including endocytic
compartments, vacuolar protein sorting pathways, ubiquitination machinery, lipid 
rafts cytoskeletal components. continued elucidation complex and
orchestrated virus-host interactions provide fundamental understanding 
the molecular mechanisms filovirus assembly/budding ultimately lead the
development novel viral- and/or host-oriented therapeutics inhibit
filovirus egress spread. article focus recent studies
on host interactions modulation filovirus budding summarize key
findings investigations.
