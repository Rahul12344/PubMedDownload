noroviruses emerged common cause foodborne outbreaks acute
nonbacterial gastroenteritis. study, two methods extraction of
viruses deli ham compared. using methods, little 1 10
reverse transcription (rt)-pcr units inoculated norovirus enterovirus
could detected nested rt-pcr assays. fastest efficient
extraction method based trizol ls reagent chosen identify viruses in
food items associated three different outbreaks. norovirus detected
using nested (real time) rt-pcr assays target genome region routinely
used diagnosis human cases, thereby facilitating comparison of
sequences detected food clinical specimens. one outbreak, norovirus 
sequence (163/163 nucleotides) identical detected clinical samples
was found salami sliced food handler recent history of
gastroenteritis. two outbreaks, norovirus detected leftovers
of spareribs ham, fecal samples affected persons available.
the methods used study may useful future outbreak investigations
because extraction method easy perform suitable particular
type food detection method facilitates direct comparison patient
and food data.
