exclusion bacteriophage t1 bacteriophage lambda. ii. synthesis of
t1-specific macromolecules n-mediated excluding conditions.

gawron mc, christensen jr, shoemaker tm.

the results experiments investigating t1 macromolecular synthesis under
n-mediated excluding conditions failed demonstrate substantial alteration in
the t1 mrna production excluding cultures stage t1 infectious
cycle. number t1 dna sequences excluding culture found be
one-third one-half found t1-infected cultures. severe
reduction t1-specific macromolecules seen protein synthesis. total
incorporation labeled amino acids reduced sixfold, gel experiments
confirmed t1-specific proteins capable detection reduced in
excluding cells.
