viral isolation, polymerase chain reaction (pcr), dot blot hybridization (dbh),
and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ielisa) used the
diagnosis lumpy skin disease clinically infected, fevered, apparently
normal dairy cows. lumpy skin disease virus (lsdv) isolated skin
biopsies blood samples collected clinically infected cows percentages
of 72% 20%, respectively. virus recovered blood samples collected
from fevered cows percentage 33.3%. pcr dbh detected viral dna 
100% skin biopsies collected clinically infected cows whereas the
detection rates blood samples collected clinically infected animals 
100% 84% using pcr dbh, respectively. viral dna detected blood
samples collected fevered cows using pcr dbh percentages 77.8% and
66.6%, respectively. 19.1% blood samples collected in-contact cows
was positive pcr dbh. detection rates antibodies lsdv 
using ielisa serum samples collected clinically infected fevered cows
were 56% 11.1%, respectively, whereas in-contact cows antibodies
against virus.
