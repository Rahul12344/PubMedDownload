mucosal epithelia provide strong barriers pathogens. instance, the
outward facing apical membrane polarized epithelial cells lacks receptors 
agents, hepatitis c virus, herpesvirus, reovirus, poliovirus or
adenovirus. addition, macrophages eliminate pathogens luminal space. 
here show human adenovirus type 5 engages antiviral immune response to
enter polarized epithelial cells. blood-derived macrophages co-cultured apically 
on polarized epithelial cells facilitate epithelial infection. infection also
occurs absence macrophages, virus-conditioned macrophage-medium
containing chemotactic cytokine cxcl8 (interleukin-8), recombinant cxcl8
are present. polarized cells, cxcl8 activates src-family tyrosine kinase via
the apical cxcr1 cxcr2 receptors. activation process relocates viral
co-receptor ανβ3 integrin apical surface, enables apical binding and
infection adenovirus depending primary adenovirus receptor car. 
paradigm may explain mucosal pathogens enter epithelial cells.
