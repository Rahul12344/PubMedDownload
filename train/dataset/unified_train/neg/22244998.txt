phosphorus (p) availability, often limits productivity marine
ecosystems, shapes p-acquisition gene content marine cyanobacteria
prochlorococcus [1-4] viruses (cyanophages). bacteria, in
prochlorococcus genes regulated phor/phob two-component
regulatory system used sense respond p availability is
typical signal transduction systems found diverse organisms. replication of
cyanophage genomes requires significant amount p, therefore phages
could gain fitness advantage influencing host p acquisition p-limited
environments. show transcription phage-encoded

infecting host cells p starved, relative p-replete control cells. 
further show phage versions genes regulated host's
phor/phob system. extends fundamental signaling mechanism to
viruses also first example regulation lytic phage genes by
nutrient limitation host. such, reveals important new dimension
