since emergence 1996 southern china, highly pathogenic h5n1 avian
influenza viruses spread widely continue circulate countries.
genetic reassortment created multiple h5n1 virus lineages, 
dominant nature. however, mechanism certain h5n1 influenza virus 
lineages (or genotypes) become dominant avian species remains unknown. here,
we used competitive inoculation genetic analysis resultant viruses 
show nucleoprotein (np) matrix protein (m) segments fujian-like
viruses (clade 2.3.4), became predominant southern china mid-2006,
are responsible viral dominance embryonated eggs. found that
specific residues np proteins play key roles conferring this
viral dominance; specifically, glutamic acid position 66 m2 conserved
among fujian-like viruses. results suggest roles viral
proteins influenza virus dominance.
