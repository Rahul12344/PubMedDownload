myeloid cells play central role context viral eradication, yet
precisely cells differentiate throughout course acute infections
is poorly understood. study, developed novel quantitative
temporal vivo proteomics (qtips) platform capture proteomic signatures of
temporally transitioning virus-driven myeloid cells directly situ, thus taking
into consideration host-virus interactions throughout course infection.
qtips, combination phenotypic, functional, metabolic analyses,
elucidated pivotal role inflammatory cd11b+, ly6g-, ly6chigh-low cells in
antiviral immune response viral clearance. importantly, the
time-resolved qtips data set showed transition cd11b+, ly6g-, ly6chigh-low
cells m2-like macrophages, displayed increased antigen-presentation
capacities bioenergetic demands late infection. elucidated pivotal 
role myeloid cells virus clearance show cells phenotypically,
functionally, metabolically undergo timely transition inflammatory 
m2-like macrophages vivo. respect growing appreciation vivo
examination viral-host interactions role myeloid cells, this
study elucidates use quantitative proteomics reveal role and
response distinct immune cell populations throughout course virus
infection.
