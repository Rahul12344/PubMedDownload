virus specific macromolecular synthesis studied vero cells infected with
plaque-purified rubella virus one-step multiplication conditions. under
these conditions, rate virus production found increase rapidly
until 24 hr postinfection time rate virus production rose more
slowly, reaching peak level 48 hr postinfection. peak rate virus
production maintained 72 hr postinfection. majority cells
remained alive 96 hr postinfection, although 20 30% decrease 
number living cells occurred 24 48 hr postinfection, time
period cytopathic effect first observed. virus structural
proteins first detected intracellularly 16 hr postinfection. rate 
synthesis proteins already maximal 16 hr postinfection and
remained constant 48 hr postinfection. immunofluorescence, cells
expressing virus proteins first observed 12 hr postinfection. 24 hr
postinfection, 35 50% cells infected culture exhibiting
immunofluorescence, 36 hr postinfection, 65 90% cells were
exhibiting immunofluorescence, 48 hr postinfection, cells 
exhibiting immunofluorescence. virus genomic subgenomic rna species 
first detectable 12 hr postinfection. rate synthesis these
species peaked 26 hr postinfection. rubella virus infection found 
no effect total cell rna synthesis. however, modest inhibition total cell
protein synthesis reached 40% 48 hr postinfection observed. when
northern analysis rna extracted infected cells performed, a
negative-polarity, virus-specific rna probe hybridized virus genomic 
and subgenomic rna species. positive-polarity, virus-specific rna probe
hybridized predominantly negative-polarity rna genome length indicating
that genomic subgenomic rnas synthesized genome-length
negative-polarity template. defective interfering (di) rnas detected 
infected cells 96 hr postinfection cells onto virus released 
through 96 hr postinfection passaged. thus, generation di particles by
rubella virus appears play role slow, noncytopathic replication of
this virus ability rubella virus-infected cells survive for
extended periods time.
