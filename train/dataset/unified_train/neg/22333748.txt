objective: hepatitis b surface (hbsag) envelope (hbeag) antigen loss 
primary goals treating chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv). although their
quantification useful antivirals, case with
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf), particularly hiv infection.
design: prospective, multicenter, cohort study 143 antiretroviral-experienced 
hiv-hbv-co-infected patients initiating tdf.
methods: hbsag (iu/ml) hbeag levels (s/co) measured every 6 months.
hbsag hbeag decline (δ) assessed mixed-effect linear models.
quantification criteria used assess predictability antigen loss with
time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves.
results: median follow-up 30.3 months, cumulative incidence rate of
hbsag loss 4.0% (n = 4) entire study population hbeag loss was
21.0% (n = 17) 96 hbeag-positive patients. δhbsag steady during
follow-up (hbeag-positive: -0.027; hbeag-negative: -0.017 log(10) iu/ml per
month), whereas δhbeag ratio strongly biphasic (-27.1 s/co per month before
and -6.5 s/co per month 18 months). baseline hbeag δhbeag were
significantly different patients harboring precore mutations (p < 0.01),
whereas δhbsag δhbeag significantly slower among hbeag-positive
patients cd4(+) t-cell count less 350 cells/μl (p < 0.05). hbeag-ratio 
of 10 s/co less 12 months therapy optimal marker hbeag loss, 
with high sensitivity (0.82) specificity (0.84) 36 months. patients
with hbsag loss, three four (75.0%) patients baseline level hbsag 
400 iu/ml less.
conclusion: tdf treatment, hiv-induced immunosuppression hbv genetic
variability associated differences hbsag hbeag decline among
antiretroviral-experienced, co-infected patients. considering decline of
hbsag level slow, evaluation needed determine role a
marker therapeutic efficacy.
