differential expression cellular src gene vertebrate development.

schartl m, barnekow a.

cellular genes homologous transforming genes certain rna tumor
viruses suspected play functional role normal developmental
processes. investigate further, studying expression the
cellular homolog rous sarcoma virus transforming gene (c-src) during
embryogenesis fish, frog, chicken quantitative determination the
activity c-src encoded protein kinase (pp60c-src). kinase activity
from embryos fish, frog, chicken displays enzymatic
characteristics kinase adult animals: phosphorylates tyrosine
residues protein substrates, activity relatively insensitive to
inhibition diadenosine nucleotide ap4a. course development, 
the varying kinase activity level reflects differential expression c-src
gene product. kinase activity low early development, increases
dramatically organogenesis, decreases thereafter level found in
adult animals. kinase activity displays organ specificity, brain
showing highest activity embryos well adults. muscle, however,
shows high activities organogenesis, barely detectable activity 
in adult animals. data suggest, therefore, c-src gene product plays 
more role differentiation proliferation processes during
embryogenesis, may act pleiotropic effector.
