the epidemiology herpesvirus papio, lymphocryptovirus similar to
epstein-barr virus (ebv), studied captive colony >1900 baboons.
herpesvirus papio igg antibody titers measured ifa. total, 438
specimens 296 baboons assessed, including 116 serial specimens 52 
juveniles 6 infants studied monthly 1 year following birth age 18 
months. maternally derived antibody reached nadir 4 months age. 75%
of animals 12 months age >95% animals age 24 months
demonstrated serologic evidence herpesvirus papio infection. age 3
years, geometric mean titer 1:60-75. epidemiology herpesvirus
papio infection baboons closely parallels ebv infection humans. 
animal model lymphocryptovirus infection facilitate investigations of
human lymphocryptovirus biology.
