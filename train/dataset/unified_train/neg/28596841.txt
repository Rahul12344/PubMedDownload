emerging viruses hiv, dengue, influenza a, sars coronavirus, ebola, and
other viruses pose significant threat human health. majority these
viruses responsible outbreaks pathogenic lethal infections. to
date, effective therapeutic strategies available prophylaxis
and treatment infections. chloroquine analogs used decades
as primary successful drugs malaria. concomitant the
emergence chloroquine-resistant plasmodium strains subsequent decrease
in use antimalarial drugs, applications analogs been
investigated. since analogs interesting biochemical properties, these
drugs found effective wide variety viral infections. as
antiviral action, analogs shown inhibit acidification of
endosome events replication infection. moreover,
immunomodulatory effects analogs beneficial patients severe 
inflammatory complications several viral diseases. interestingly, one the
successful targeting strategies inhibition hiv replication the
analogs inÂ vitro tested several clinical trials. review
focuses potentialities chloroquine analogs treatment of
endosomal low ph dependent emerging viral diseases.
