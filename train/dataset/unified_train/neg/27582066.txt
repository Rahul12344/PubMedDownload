coxsackievirus a6 (ca6) induce atypical hand, foot, mouth disease, 
is characterized severe rash, onychomadesis higher rate infection 
adults. increasing epidemiological data indicated outbreaks of
ca6-associated hand, foot, mouth disease markedly increased worldwide in
recent years. however, current body knowledge infection, pathogenic
mechanism, immunogenicity ca6 still limited. study, we
established first neonatal mouse model evaluation antibodies and
vaccines ca6. ca6 strain ca6/141 could infect one-day-old balb/c
mouse intraperitoneal intracerebral routes. infected mice
developed clinical symptoms, inactivity, wasting, hind-limb paralysis and
even death. pathological examination indicated ca6 showed special tropism to
skeletal muscles skin, nervous system cardiac muscles.
infections ca6 could induce vesicles dermis without rash mice,
and ca6 antigen mainly localized hair follicles. strong tropism of
ca6 skin may related severe clinical features infants. this
mouse model applied evaluate efficacy therapeutic
antibody experimental vaccine ca6. potential mab 1d5 could fully
protect mice lethal ca6 infection also showed good therapeutic effects
in ca6-infected mice. addition, inactivated ca6 vaccine evaluated
through maternal immunization showed 100% protection neonatal mice from
lethal ca6 challenge. collectively, results indicate infection
model useful tool future studies vaccines antiviral reagents 
against ca6.
