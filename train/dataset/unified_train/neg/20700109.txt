delivery genes larger wild-type adeno-associated virus (aav)
4,681 nucleotide genome inefficient using aav vectors. previously
demonstrated vitro concurrent proteasome inhibitor (pi) treatment
improves transduction aav vectors encoding oversized transgenes. this
study, aav vector 5.6 kilobase (kb) factor viii expression cassette was
used test effect us food drug administration-approved pi
(bortezomib) treatment concurrent vector delivery vivo. intrahepatic
vector delivery resulted factor viii expression persisted >1 year 
hemophilia mice. single-dose bortezomib given aav2 aav8 factor viii
vector enhanced expression average ~600 ~300%, respectively. moreover,
coadministration aav8.caninefviii (1 Ã— 10(13) vg/kg) bortezomib in
hemophilia dogs (n = 4) resulted normalization whole blood clotting
time (wbct) 90% reduction hemorrhages >32 months compared untreated
hemophilia dogs (n = 3) dogs administered vector alone (n = 3).
demonstration long-term phenotypic correction hemophilia dogs with
combination adjuvant bortezomib aav vector expressing oversized transgene
establishes preclinical studies support testing humans provides a
working paradigm facilitate significant expansion therapeutic targets for
human gene therapy.
