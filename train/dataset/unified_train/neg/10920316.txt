objective: sought describe rates risk factors complications by
delivery mode among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women cd4 counts
of < = 500/microl.
study design: complication rates calculated delivery mode, follows:
planned cesarean delivery performed without labor rupture membranes, 
cesarean delivery performed labor rupture membranes, vaginal
delivery. risk factors evaluated.
results: major complications planned cesarean delivery (n = 37), other
cesarean delivery (n = 95), vaginal delivery (n = 365) groups amnionitis
or endometritis (16%, 27%, 7%, respectively), wound infection (5%, 8%, and
<1%, respectively), transfusion (8%, 6%, 3%, respectively). any
peripartum infection occurred among 16 (18%) cd4 count of
<200/microl 43 (13%) cd4 count > =200/microl (p =.17). on
multivariate analyses, factors associated amnionitis-endometritis were
cesarean delivery african american race, factor associated with
transfusion third-trimester anemia.
conclusion: endometritis wound infection occurred frequently among human
immunodeficiency virus-infected women cesarean among women undergoing 
vaginal delivery; however, complication rates overall within range
reported human immunodeficiency virus-negative women. measures decrease
complications human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, greater use
of prophylactic antibiotics, assessed.
