hiv type (hiv-1) cause g(2) cell cycle arrest death cd4(+) t
lymphocytes vitro inexorable depletion cells vivo. however,
the molecular mechanism viral cytopathicity satisfactorily
elucidated. previously, showed hiv-1 kills cells necrotic form 
cell death requires high level expression integrated provirus 
the env nef genes. determine viral protein(s) required cell
death, systematically mutated, alone combination, orfs nl4-3
strain hiv-1. found elimination viral functions encoded 
gag-pol vpu, tat, rev mitigate cytopathicity. however,
elimination vif vpr accessory genes together, individually,
renders virus incapable causing cell death g(2) cell cycle blockade.
we thus identify vif vpr necessary cell cytopathic effects induced
by hiv-1. findings may provide important insight molecular
mechanism viral pathogenesis aids.
