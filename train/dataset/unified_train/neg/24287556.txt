a library hydrazide derivatives synthesized target non-structural
protein 1 influenza virus (ns1) means develop anti-influenza drug
leads. lead compound
3-hydroxy-n-[(z)-1-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)ethylideneamino]naphthalene
-2-carboxamide, denoted "henc", identified ability to
increase melting temperature effector domain (ed) ns1 protein, 
as assayed using differential scanning fluorimetry. library henc analogs was
tested inhibitory effect influenza virus replication mdck cells.
a systematic diversification henc revealed identity r group
attached imine carbon atom significantly influenced antiviral
activity. phenyl cyclohexyl position yielded potent
antiviral activity. phenyl containing compound antiviral activity similar
to active form oseltamivir (tamiflu), detectable effect
on cell viability.
