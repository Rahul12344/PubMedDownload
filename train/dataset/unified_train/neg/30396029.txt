rift valley fever virus (rvfv) zoonotic disease livestock causes
several clinical outcomes people including febrile disease, hemorrhagic fever,
and/or encephalitis. aerosol infection rvfv, lewis rats develop lethal
encephalitic disease, use model studying disease mechanisms 
of rvfv infection brain. permeability brain vasculature relation
to virus invasion replication known. here, found vascular
permeability brain occurred late course infection and
corresponded temporally expression matrix metalloproteinase-9 (mmp-9).
virus replication ongoing within central nervous system several days 
prior detectable vascular leakage. based study, vascular permeability 
was required entry rvfv brain rats. prevention vascular
leakage late infection may important component prevention lethal 
neurological disease rat model.
