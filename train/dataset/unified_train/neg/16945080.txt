objective: assess incidence consequences adverse reactions among
african hiv-positive pregnant women treated fixed-dose combinations a
nevirapine-containing antiretroviral (arv) triple therapy.
methods: retrospective analysis clinical files 703 hiv-1-positive
pregnant women treated nevirapine-containing regimen may 2002 
july 2004 conducted. selection criteria inclusion analysis were:
(a) taking arv 14 days; (b) baseline values transaminases 
the threshold 2.5 times upper limit normal (uln). women a
nevirapine-containing regimen median 127 days [interquartile range (iqr)
86-190 days], starting average 27th week gestation (standard
deviation+/-9.5) continuing maximum 6 months delivery. all
women offered formula milk feed babies. highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (haart) continued beyond 6 months patient qualified on
the first visit. main outcome measures incidence hepatotoxicity, skin
rashes stevens-johnson syndrome. multivariate analysis assess impact
of several factors adverse reaction rate performed.
results: 1 august 2004, 554 pregnancies reached term, 96 women still
pregnant, 53 women dropped programme giving birth. 2 
months therapy percentage patients viral load less 1000
hiv-1 rna copies/ml increased 78.6%; average cd4 cell counts increased from
490 cells/microl therapy 630 therapy. incidence grade 3-4 
adverse reactions (hepatotoxicity, skin rashes stevens-johnson syndrome) 
6.5, 2.4 1.1%, respectively. five women died pregnancy (0.88%). only
one deaths could associated arv treatment.
conclusion: nevirapine-containing regimens pregnant woman, cd4 cell
count levels, appear safe african settings.
