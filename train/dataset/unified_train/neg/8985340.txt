initiation reverse transcription human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) occurs extension 3' end cellular trna complexed the
primer binding site (pbs) located near 5' end viral rna genome.
although pbss naturally occurring hiv-1 viruses complementary 
the 3'-terminal 18 nucleotides trna(lys)3, identified hiv-1 virus 
contained pbs complementary 3' nucleotides trna(met); pbs this
virus stable upon extended culture reverted back wild type
(s.-m. kang, j. k. wakefield, c. d. morrow, virology 222:401-414, 1996). to
further characterize virus pbs complementary trna(met), dna
fragment encompassing pbs u5 region proviral genome was
substituted region infectious hiv-1 proviral clone [named
phxb2(ac-met)]. three additional proviral genomes also created: phxb2(met), 
which isogenic phxb2 except pbs complementary trna(met);
phxb2(met-ac-met), contains pbs sequence complementary the
3'-terminal nucleotides sequence upstream pbs u5 complementary
to anticodon region trna(met); phxb2(met-c-met), contains two
g-to-c changes predicted disrupt complementarity within trna(met)
anticodon region. viruses derived transfection proviral genomes
were infectious, although appearance viruses delayed compared to
that wild-type virus. pcr amplification dna sequence analysis the
pbs regions proviral genomes revealed pbss viruses derived
from phxb2(met) phxb2(ac-met) reverted back wild type days 16 and
44 postcoculture, respectively. two new, novel mutant viruses identified
among viruses derived phxb2(met-c-met) day 35 postcoculture: one
contained pbs complementary trna(lys)1,2, second maintained pbs 
complementary trna(met) contained 26-nucleotide deletion u5 upstream 
of anticodon-complementary region. day 125 postcoculture, pbs the
virus culture reverted back wild type, complementary to
trna(lys)3. contrast, viruses derived phxb2(met-ac-met) stably
maintained pbs complementary trna(met) 125-day culture period
examined. results studies support idea hiv-1 maintain a
pbs complementary alternative trnas provided appropriate
complementarity exists u5-pbs region viral rna genome 
trna molecule used initiate reverse transcription.
