viral vectors provide highly efficient method transfer foreign genes
into variety quiescent dividing eukaryotic cells many animal
origins. recombinant vectors derived increasing number mammalian
viruses (herpes simplex virus, autonomous non-autonomous parvoviruses,
poxviruses, retroviruses, adenoviruses available today, vectors based murine
retroviruses human adenoviruses constitute preferential candidates the
delivery marker therapeutic genes human somatic cells. the
availability vectors made possible recent transition human
gene therapy laboratory benches clinical settings. current
recombinant vectors generated deleting essential viral genes in
order make space available introduction passenger genes. such
vectors therefore unable replicate absence critical gene
products production relies development stable complementation
cell lines providingin trans missing viral functions. although
complementation (or packaging) cell lines available adenovirus and
retrovirus vectors, respective drawbacks still limit use research 
applications phase clinical trials. future success failure human 
gene therapy therefore rely production improved generations of
packaging cell lines produce safer efficient vectors 
fully adapted large scale production clinical applications.
