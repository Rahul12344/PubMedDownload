the aim case control study investigate clinical significance
of hepatitis b virus nuclear core antigen (hbcag) young cirrhotic patients.
fifteen cirrhotic patients nuclear hbcag liver biopsies were
included. clinicopathological parameters well core gene sequences
were compared sex- age-matched (1 2) control group. the
mean follow-up periods 124 +/- 80 102 +/- 43 months, respectively.
expression nuclear hbcag cirrhotic liver significantly associated 
higher aspartate aminotransferase levels (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase
levels (p < 0.001), alpha-fetoprotein levels (p = 0.002), well a
shorter duration develop hepatocellular carcinoma liver decompensation
(kaplan-meier method, p = 0.044). sequence analysis revealed mutations the
nuclear localization signal (nls) core protein five cirrhotic patients with
nuclear hbcag (q171k four q179k one patients). site-directed
mutagenesis experiments demonstrated q171k q179k mutation
enhanced nuclear localization core protein. conclusion, expression of
nuclear hbcag young cirrhotic patients associated severe
hepatitis activities well unfavourable long-term outcome. mutations on
the nls core protein selected patients nuclear hbcag.
