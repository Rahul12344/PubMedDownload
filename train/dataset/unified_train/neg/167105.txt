howe cc, tan kb, sokol f.

the fate parental sv40 dna monkey kidney cells investigated by
infecting cells purified virus labelled [3-h]-thymidine.
5-bromodeoxyuridine (200 mug/ml) added cells 2 h infection to
label virus progeny dna. 72 h post-infection cells harvested and
virus dna extracted fractionated isopycnic sedimentation cscl
solution. following dnas characteristic densities found: light
(ll), 1.70 g/ml; hybrid (hl), 1-75 g/ml heavy dna (hh), 1-80 g/ml. the
total cell-associated [3-h]-radioactivity (derived parental virus), more
than 90% recovered unreplicated parental dna(ll dna), 2% was
recovered hl dna 1-7% associated hh dna. the
unreplicated parental dna present uncoated intact dna complexed with
proteins present infected cell. hl dna contains one light parental and
one heavy progeny dna strand. nature radioactivity present hh
dna remains determined.
