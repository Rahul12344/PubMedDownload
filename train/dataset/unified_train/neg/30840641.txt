background: urethritis common sexually transmitted disease, human
adenoviruses (hadvs) found associated nonchlamydial
nongonococcal urethritis. however, level viability hadv urine
of patients urethritis remain unclear.
methods: male patients urethritis asymptomatic group screened
using first-void urine (fvu) urethritis-related pathogens identify
those hadv dna. fvu gargle fluid collected patients
including asymptomatic group. swab eye discharge also 
collected patients eye symptoms. pharyngeal and/ ocular fluid
was also screened cases fvu positive hadv dna. hadvs
were isolated using a549 cell lines typed sequencing, viral shedding
during 2 years quantified using real-time pcr. prevalence hadv was
assessed urethritis asymptomatic groups, viral load, isolated hadv
types, urethral symptoms compared groups.
results: positive detection rate hadv dna significantly higher 
urethritis group asymptomatic group. 398 patients urethritis,
hadv isolated 32 cases (23 cases hadv dna detected
with mean 2 Ã— 109 copies/ml urine samples). 124 control cases, one had
hadv monoinfection. frequently detected hadv type 56, followed by
types 37 64. regarding relationship symptoms isolated hadvs, 
the virus isolated 12 days urethritis symptoms disappeared.
conclusions: hadvs significantly detected isolated fvu of
patients urethritis. furthermore, high levels infectious hadvs are
excreted urine long period even urethritis symptoms disappear.
