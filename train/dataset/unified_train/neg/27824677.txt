background: hiv infection biomarkers inflammation [measured by
interleukin-6 (il-6)], monocyte activation [soluble cd14 (scd14)], and
coagulation (d-dimer) associated morbidity mortality. we
hypothesized immunologic processes mediate (explain) the
excess risk mortality among hiv infected (hiv+) versus uninfected people
independently comorbid diseases.
methods: among 2350 (1521 hiv+) participants veterans aging cohort study
biomarker cohort (vacs bc), investigated whether association hiv
and mortality altered adjustment il-6, scd14, d-dimer, accounting 
for confounders. participants followed date blood draw biomarker
assays (baseline) death july 25, 2013. analyses included ordered
logistic regression cox proportional hazards regression.
results: 6.9 years (median), 414 deaths occurred. proportional odds of
being higher quartile il-6, scd14, d-dimer 2-3 fold higher for
viremic hiv+ versus uninfected people. mortality rates higher among hiv+
compared uninfected people [incidence rate ratio (95% ci): 1.31 (1.06 to
1.62)]. mortality risk increased increasing quartiles il-6, scd14, and
d-dimer regardless hiv status. adjustment il-6, scd14, d-dimer
partially attenuated mortality risk among hiv+ people unsuppressed viremia
(hiv-1 rna ≥10,000 copies per milliliter) compared uninfected people-hazard 
ratio (95% ci) decreased 2.18 (1.60 2.99) 2.00 (1.45 2.76).
conclusions: hiv infection associated elevated il-6, scd14, d-dimer, 
which turn associated mortality. baseline measures these
biomarkers partially mediate excess mortality risk among hiv+ versus uninfected
people.
