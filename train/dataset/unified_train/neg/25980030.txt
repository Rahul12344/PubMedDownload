the cd300a inhibitory receptor belongs cd300 family cell surface
molecules regulate diverse array immune cell processes. inhibitory 
signal cd300a depends phosphorylation tyrosine residues embedded 
itims cytoplasmic tail. cd300a broadly expressed myeloid and
lymphoid cells, expression differentially regulated depending the
cell type. finding cd300a recognizes phosphatidylserine and
phosphatidylethanolamine, two aminophospholipids exposed outer leaflet 
dead activated cells, shed new light role modulation of
immune functions participation host response several
diseases states, infectious diseases, cancer, allergy, chronic
inflammatory diseases. review summarizes literature cd300a
expression, regulation, signaling pathways, ligand interaction, well as
its role fine tuning immune cell functions clinical relevance.
