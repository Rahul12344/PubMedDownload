our previous study proved n-terminal (aa693-711) glycoprotein e2
contained sequential neutralizing epitopes. study, four candidate
epitope-vaccines (evs) separately prepared evaluated. among them,
epitope-vaccine ev-bc1a (bc1a: aa693-699) induced high level epitope-specific 
neutralizing antibodies exhibited similar protective capability that
induced chinese vaccine strain (c-strain). results confirmed ckedyry
(aa693-699) principal sequential neutralizing epitope e2 n-terminal.
moreover, findings also indicate epitope-vaccine potent candidate
strategy marker vaccine classical swine fever virus (csfv).
