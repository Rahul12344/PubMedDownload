affinity and/or immunoaffinity chromatography one less commonly method 
used large scale separation purposes. technic greatly selective
and gives high yields, allows vivo removal, extracorporeal
circulation, harmful substances patient plasma well purification of
molecules biological therapeutic uses. large development increased
safety method dependent economic, technical legal
requirements. particular attention must drawn following points.
possibility multiple uses affinity supports contributes lowering the
cost method. desorption agents chosen according best
compromise total desorption preservation adsorption capacity 
runs. likewise essential store affinity supports conditions allowing 
prevention contamination without loss adsorption capacity. developing 
and optimizing affinity chromatography procedure, important minimize 
the amount ligand released affinity support. besides economic and
technical aspects, necessary take account legal requirements,
particularly related preparation ligand especially is
monoclonal polyclonal antibodies. important consideration the
therapeutic use antibodies (either preparation biological products
or extracorporeal circulation procedure) possible presence of
viruses and/or potentially oncogenic macromolecules. source material be
shown free viruses, cell banks (for monoclonal antibodies) the
production antibodies must closely controlled, viral inactivation of
antibodies performed inactivation process shown be
effective.
