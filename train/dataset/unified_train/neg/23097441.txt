the human genome contains approximately 50 copies replication-defective
human endogenous retrovirus 9 (erv-9) thousands copies solitary
long term repeat (sltr) element. sltrs located upstream of
critical genes enhancer activity, sltrs located within introns
and may transcribed rnas. found intronic rnas arising u3 sltrs
of erv-9 expressed sense (s) antisense (as) transcripts all
human cells tested expression levels differed malignant versus
nonmalignant cells. nonmalignant cells, expressed higher levels than
s higher levels malignant cells; malignant cells, was
expressed amounts equivalent rna. critically, u3 rna was
found physically bind key transcription factors cellular proliferation,
including nf-y, p53, sp1, indicating rna transcripts may function
as decoy targets traps nf-y thus inhibit growth human cancer
cells. indeed, short u3 oligodeoxynucleotides (odns) based rna sequences
ably inhibited proliferation cancer cell lines driven cyclins b1/b2, the
gene targets nf-y.
