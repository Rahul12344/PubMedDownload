measles highly contagious human disease caused measles virus (mev).
in study, proteomic analysis, identified peroxiredoxin 1 (prdx1) 
host factor binds c-terminal region nucleoprotein (n; n(tail))
of mev. glutathione s-transferase (gst) pulldown experiments showed the
prdx1-binding site overlapped mev phosphoprotein (p)-binding site on
n(tail) prdx1 competed binding n(tail) p protein,
which component rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp). furthermore, rna
interference prdx1 resulted significant reduction mev growth in
hek293-slam cells. minigenome assay indicated prdx1 suppression affected
the viral rna transcription and/or replication step. relative quantification of
viral rna real-time pcr (rt-pcr) showed prdx1 suppression only
reduced viral rna transcription replication also enhanced polar
attenuation viral mrna transcription. surface plasmon resonance analysis
showed binding affinity prdx1 mev-n 40-fold lower of
mev-p mev-n, suggested prdx1 might involved early stage
of mev infection, expression level prdx1 much higher of
mev-p. since prdx1 expressed abundantly constitutively various cells, 
the results study indicate prdx1 one inherent host factors
implicated mev rna synthesis.
