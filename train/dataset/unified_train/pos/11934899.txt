the human papillomavirus (hpv) transcription/replication factor e2 essential
for life cycle hpvs. e2 protein binds dna target sequences viral
long control regions regulate transcription viral genome. also
enhances viral dna replication interacting viral replication factor
e1 recruiting origin replication may also play direct
role replication. cellular proteins e2 interacts carry out
these functions largely unknown. identify proteins yeast
two-hybrid screen carried transcription/replication domain of
hpv16 e2. screen identified several candidate interacting partners e2
including topbp1 (topoisomerase ii beta-binding protein 1). topbp1 eight
brca1 carboxyl-terminal domains found proteins regulating dna
damage response, transcription, replication. demonstrate hpv16
e2 topbp1 interact vitro vivo topbp1 enhance the
ability e2 activate transcription replication. first time
that topbp1 shown function transcriptional coactivator 
e2 interacts topbp1. removal amino-terminal domain topbp1
abolishes coactivation transcription replication. interaction may
have functional consequences upon viral life cycle.
