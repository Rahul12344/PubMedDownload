the positive-strand rna genomes caliciviruses capped, instead 
covalently linked 5' ends viral protein called vpg. lack a
cap structure typical eukaryotic mrna absence internal ribosomal
entry site suggest vpg may function translation initiation calicivirus
rna. hypothesis tested analyzing binding norwalk virus vpg to
translation initiation factors. eif3d subunit eif3 identified a
binding partner vpg yeast two-hybrid analysis. vpg bound purified
mammalian eif3 eif3 mammalian cell lysates. test effects 
vpg- eif3 interaction translation, vpg added cell-free translation
reactions programmed either capped reporter rna, rna containing emcv
internal ribosomal entry site (ires) rna cricket paralysis virus
ires. vpg inhibited translation reporter rnas dose-dependent manner. 
together, data suggest vpg may play role initiating translation 
calicivirus rna unique protein-protein interactions translation 
machinery.
