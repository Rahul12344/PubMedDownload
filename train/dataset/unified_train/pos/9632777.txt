large antigen (t antigen), early gene product simian virus 40 (sv40), is
a potent transcriptional activator cellular viral genes. recently 
have shown antigen tightly associated tfiid and, position,
performs tata-binding protein (tbp)-associated factor (taf)-like function.
based observation, asked whether antigen affected steps in
preinitiation complex assembly. using purified components vitro complex
assembly assays, found antigen specifically enhances formation of
the tbp-tfiia complex tata element. antigen accomplishes by
increasing rate formation tbp-tfiia complex tata element and
by stabilizing complexes formed promoter. addition, 
dna immunoprecipitation experiments indicate antigen associated with
the stabilized tbp-tfiia complexes bound dna. regard, has
previously shown antigen interacts tbp; present study, we
show antigen also interacts tfiia vitro. testing ability of
t antigen stabilize tbp-tfiia complex, found stabilization is
highly sensitive specific sequence context tata element. previous
studies showed antigen could activate simple promoters containing tata
elements hsp70 c-fos gene promoters failed significantly
activate similar promoters containing tata elements promoters the
sv40 early adenovirus e2a genes. find ability stabilize the
tbp-tfiia complex hsp70 c-fos tata elements, sv40 early
and e2a tata elements, correlates ability inability activate
promoters containing tata elements.
