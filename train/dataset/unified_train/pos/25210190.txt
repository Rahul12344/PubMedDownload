paramyxoviruses negative-strand rna viruses encode matrix proteins that
coordinate virus assembly process. matrix proteins link viral
glycoproteins viral ribonucleoproteins virus assembly sites often 
recruit host machinery facilitates budding process. using co-affinity 
purification strategy, identified beta subunit ap-3 adapter
protein complex, ap3b1, binding partner proteins zoonotic
paramyxoviruses nipah virus hendra virus. binding function localized to
the serine-rich acidic hinge domain ap3b1, 29-amino-acid
hinge-derived polypeptide sufficient protein binding in
coimmunoprecipitation assays. virus-like particle (vlp) production assays were
used assess relationship ap3b1 binding protein function. 
found nipah virus hendra virus, protein expression the
absence viral proteins led efficient production vlps in
transfected cells, vlp production potently inhibited upon
overexpression short m-binding polypeptides derived hinge region of
ap3b1. human bat (pteropus alecto) ap3b1-derived polypeptides were
highly effective inhibiting production vlps. vlp production also
impaired small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated depletion ap3b1 from
cells. findings suggest ap-3-directed trafficking processes are
important henipavirus particle production identify new host
protein-virus protein binding interface could become useful target in
future efforts develop small molecule inhibitors combat paramyxoviral
infections.importance: henipaviruses cause deadly infections humans, a
mortality rate 40%. hendra virus outbreaks australia, involving
horses involving transmission humans, continuing problem.
nipah virus caused large outbreak malaysia 1998, killing 109 people, 
smaller outbreaks since occurred bangladesh india. study, 
have defined, first time, host factors interact henipavirus m
proteins contribute viral particle assembly. also defined new
host protein-viral protein binding interface potentially targeted for
the inhibition paramyxovirus infections.
