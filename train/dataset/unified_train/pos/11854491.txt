we identified cellular proteins interact herpes simplex virus 
type 1 (hsv-1) origin-binding protein (ul9 protein) screening hela cell
complementary dna library using yeast two-hybrid system. approximately 7 x
10(5) colonies screened. five 48 positive clones contained cdnas that
encoded p150(glued) component dynactin complex, three contained cdnas 
for neural f box 42-kda protein (nfb42), highly enriched neural
tissue, three contained htid-1, human homologue bacterial dnaj
protein. focused report interaction viral ul9
protein cellular htid-1. vitro immunoprecipitation experiments
confirmed htid-1 interacts ul9 protein. electrophoretic
mobility-shift assays indicated htid-1 enhances binding ul9
protein hsv-1 origin, ori(s), facilitates formation multimer
from dimeric ul9 protein. htid-1 effect dna-dependent atpase or
helicase activities associated ul9 protein. findings implicate
htid-1 hsv-1 dna replication, suggest cellular protein may
provide chaperone function analogous dnaj protein escherichia coli
dna replication.
