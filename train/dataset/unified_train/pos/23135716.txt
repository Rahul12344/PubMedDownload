herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) immediate-early protein icp0 required for
efficient lytic infection productive reactivation latency induces
derepression quiescent viral genomes. despite unrelated sequence 
level, icp0 human cytomegalovirus proteins ie1 pp71 share functional
similarities abilities counteract antiviral restriction mediated by
components cellular nuclear structures known nd10. investigate the
extent ie1 pp71 might substitute icp0, cell lines developed
that express either ie1 pp71, together, inducible manner. we
found pp71 dissociated hdaxx-atrx complex inhibited accumulation 
these proteins sites juxtaposed hsv-1 genomes effect the
promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml) sp100. ie1 caused loss small
ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo)-conjugated forms pml sp100 inhibited
the recruitment proteins hsv-1 genome foci little effect on
hdaxx atrx assays. ie1 pp71 stimulated icp0-null mutant
plaque formation, neither extent achieved icp0. combination 
ie1 pp71, however, inhibited recruitment nd10 proteins viral genome
foci, stimulated icp0-null mutant hsv-1 plaque formation near wild-type
levels, efficiently induced derepression quiescent hsv-1 genomes. these
results suggest nd10-related intrinsic resistance results additive 
effects several nd10 components effects ie1 pp71 on
subsets components combine mirror overall activities icp0.
