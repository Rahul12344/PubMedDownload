human cell leukemia virus type-1 (htlv-1) causative agent fatal
adult t-cell leukemia. deregulation multiple cellular signaling
pathways viral tax protein pivotal role t-cell transformation. in
response stressful stimuli, cells mount cellular stress response limit
the damage environmental forces inflict dna proteins. stress
response, cells postpone translation cellular mrnas, are
gathered cytoplasmic mrna-silencing foci called stress granules (sgs) and
allocate available resources towards production dedicated
stress-management proteins. demonstrate tax controls formation
of sgs interferes cellular stress response pathway. agreement
with previous reports, observed tax relocates nucleus the
cytoplasm response environmental stress. found presence tax 
in cytoplasm stressed cells prevents formation sgs counteracts 
the shutoff specific host proteins. unexpectedly, nuclear localization tax 
promotes spontaneous aggregation sgs, even absence stress. mutant
analysis revealed sg inhibitory capacity tax independent its
transcriptional abilities relies interaction histone deacetylase 
6, critical component sgs. importantly, stress-protective effect tax 
was also observed context htlv-1 infected cells, shown be
less prone form sgs undergo apoptosis arsenite exposure. these
observations identify tax first virally encoded inhibitory component of
sgs unravel new strategy developed htlv-1 deregulate normal cell
processes. postulate inhibition stress response pathway tax
would favor cell survival stressful conditions may important
role htlv-1-induced cellular transformation.
