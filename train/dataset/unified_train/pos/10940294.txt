the human t-cell lymphotrophic virus, type 1 tax protein interact via c
terminus various proteins including pdz domain. work, one them,
tip-1, characterized cytoplasmic 14-kda protein mainly corresponding to
one pdz domain. two-hybrid screen performed tip-1 bait showed it
interacts human homologue rhotekin previously identified 
mice rho effector. human mouse rhotekins exhibit c termini
the sequence qspv-cooh matches x(s/t)xv-cooh consensus known for
proteins recognizing pdz domains. mutation serine valine residues to
alanine impairs interaction rhotekin tip-1. transient expression
experiments reporter construct including c-fos serum response element 
(sre) showed coexpression tip-1 constitutively active rhoa.v14
mutant human rhotekin caused strong activation sre. negative
mutant rho, rhoa.n19, unable cooperate tip-1 rhotekin. the
positive effect tip-1 also lost c terminus rhotekin was
mutated. data show complex active rho effector
rhotekin bound tip-1 produces cytoplasm signal triggers strong
activation sre.
