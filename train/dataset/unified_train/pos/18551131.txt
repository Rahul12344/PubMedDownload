apoptosis important part host's defense mechanism eliminating
invading pathogens. viruses express proteins homologous sequence and
function mammalian pro-survival bcl-2 proteins. anti-apoptotic f1l expressed
by vaccinia virus essential survival infected cells, bears no
discernable sequence homology proteins immediate orthologues in
related pox viruses. report crystal structure f1l reveals a
bcl-2-like fold unusual n-terminal extension. protein forms novel
domain-swapped dimer alpha1 helix exchanged domain. binding
studies reveal atypical bh3-binding profile, sub-micromolar affinity only
for bh3 peptide pro-apoptotic bim low micromolar affinity bh3 
peptides bak bax. binding interaction sensitive f1l mutations
within predicted canonical bh3-binding groove, suggesting parallels between
how vaccinia virus f1l myxoma virus m11l bind bh3 domains. structural
comparison f1l bcl-2 family members reveals novel sequence
signature redefines bh4 domain structural motif present both
pro- anti-apoptotic bcl-2 members, including viral bcl-2-like proteins.
