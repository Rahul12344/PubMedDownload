translation initiation picornavirus genome regulated internal
ribosome entry site (ires). ires neurovirulent picornavirus, gdvii
strain theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, requires polypyrimidine
tract-binding protein (ptb) function. although neural cells deficient
in ptb, express neural-specific homologue ptb (nptb). show 
nptb ptb bind similarly multiple sites gdvii ires, rendering it
competent efficient translation initiation. mutation ptb nptb site
results prominent decrease nptb ptb binding, decrease in
activity nptb compared ptb promoting translation initiation, and
attenuation neurovirulence virus without marked effect virus
growth non-neural cells. addition second-site mutation mutant 
ires generates new ptb (nptb) binding site, restores nptb binding,
translation initiation neurovirulence. conclude tissue-specific
expression differential rna-binding properties ptb nptb important 
determinants cell-specific translational control viral neurovirulence.
