human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) vif essential viral evasion host
antiviral factor cem15/apobec3g. report vif interacts cellular
proteins cul5, elongins b c, rbx1 form skp1-cullin-f-box (scf)-like
complex. ability vif suppress antiviral activity apobec3g was
specifically dependent cul5-scf function, allowing vif interact with
apobec3g induce ubiquitination degradation. vif mutant that
interacted apobec3g cul5-scf functionally inactive. the
cul5-scf also required vif function distantly related simian
immunodeficiency virus mac. results indicate conserved cul5-scf
pathway used vif potential target antiviral development.
