poxviruses large dna viruses replicate cytosol express
numerous proteins subvert host immunity. vaccinia virus a46 25kda
protein antagonizes multiple components toll-like/interleukin-1
receptor (tlr) pathway targeting cytosolic adaptor proteins. a46 binds to
myd88, mal/tirap, trif tram suppresses activation nf-κb and
interferon regulatory factors. cytosolic adaptors tir domain 
that critical oligomerization signaling. although structure 
a46 unknown, alternatively described α/β-fold tir domain, or
an α-helical bcl-2 fold. provide experimental evidence the
c-terminus a46 adopts dimeric α-helical structure, segment
retains ability interact monomeric mal. furthermore, peptide
fragment a46 termed viper, previously shown retain biological
properties full-length protein, interact mal vitro. in
summary, provide first time biophysical analysis binding a
poxvirus protein tir domain-containing adaptor molecule.
