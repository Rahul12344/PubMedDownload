the proline-rich l domains human immunodeficiency virus 1 (hiv-1) other
retroviruses interact late endocytic proteins virion assembly and
budding. contrast, ypdl l domain equine infectious anemia virus (eiav) 
is apparently unique reported ability interact mu2
subunit ap-2 adaptor protein complex alg-2-interacting protein 1 
(aip1/alix) protein factors involved early late endosome formation,
respectively. define mechanisms eiav adapts vesicle
trafficking machinery facilitate virion production, examined the
specificity eiav p9 binding endocytic factors effects virion
production alterations early late endocytic protein expression. the
results studies demonstrated (i) approximately 300-residue
region aip1/alix-(409-715) sufficient binding eiav ypdl motif; 
(ii) overexpression aip1/alix ap-2 mu2 subunit specifically inhibited
ypdl-mediated eiav budding; (iii) virion budding replication-competent
eiav variant l domain replaced hiv ptap sequence inhibited by
wild type mutant mu2 level similar observed a
dominant-negative mutant tsg101 expressed; (iv) overexpression or
sirna silencing aip1/alix ap-2 revealed additive suppression of
ypdl-mediated eiav budding. taken together, results indicated both
early late endocytic proteins facilitate eiav production mediated either
ypdl ptap l domains, suggesting comprehensive involvement endocytic
factors retroviral assembly budding accessed distinct l
domain specificities.
