dendritic cells (dcs) express multiple toll-like receptors (tlr) distinct
cellular locations. herpes simplex viruses (hsv) reported engage
both surface tlr2 intracellular tlr9 conventional dcs. however, the
contributions tlrs recognition hsv induction of
proinflammatory cytokines dcs remain unclear. here, demonstrate rare
population hsv, laboratory strains primary clinical isolates
from humans, capacity activate tlr2. virus population is
recognized tlr2 tlr9 induction il-6 il-12
secretion bone marrow-derived dcs. further, describe previously
uncharacterized pathway viral recognition tlr2 tlr9 engaged
in sequence within dc. live viral infection results two additional
agonists tlr2 tlr9. results indicate cells express
multiple tlrs, pathogens contain multiple pathogen-associated molecular
patterns detected orchestrated sequence suggest innate 
immune system dcs optimized linking uptake degradation pathogens 
to microbial recognition.
