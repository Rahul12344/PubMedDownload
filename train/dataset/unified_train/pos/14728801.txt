enhancer ii (enii) one critical cis-elements hepatitis b virus
(hbv) genome hepatic viral gene transcription dna replication. the
liver-specific activity enii regulated multiple liver-enriched
transcription factors, including lrh-1/hb1f, hnf1, hnf3b, hnf4 c/ebp.
knowledge interplay important factors still limited. this
study, demonstrate functional synergism orphan nuclear receptor 
lrh-1/hb1f homeoprotein hnf1 up-regulating liver-specific activity
of enii. synergism sufficient initiating viral gene transcription
and dna replication non-hepatic cells. defined activation domains 
in hb1f hnf1 contribute synergism. show hb1f 
hnf1 interact directly vitro mapped domains required this
interaction.
