nef human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) auxiliary protein plays
an important role virus replication onset acquired
immunodeficiency. although known functions nef might explain contribution 
to hiv-1-associated pathogenesis, nef increases virus infectivity still an
open question. vitro, nef-deleted viruses defect prevents
efficient completion early steps replication. previously shown that
this restriction due absence nef viral particles. rather, a
loss function virus-producing cells accounts lower infectivity of
nef-deleted viruses compared wild-type (wt) viruses. used dige and
itraq identify differences proteomes wt nef-deleted
viruses. observe glucosidase ii enriched wt virions, whereas ezrin,
alg-2, cd81, ehd4 enriched nef-deleted virions. functional analysis
shows glucosidase ii, alg-2, cd81 nef-independent effect
on infectivity. contrast, ezrin ehd4 involved ability nef to
increase virus infectivity (referred thereafter nef potency). indeed,
simultaneous ezrin ehd4 depletion supt1 293t virus-producing cells
result ∼30 ∼70% decrease nef potency, respectively. finally, while
ezrin behaves inhibitory factor counteracted nef, ehd4 be
considered cofactors required nef increase virus infectivity.
