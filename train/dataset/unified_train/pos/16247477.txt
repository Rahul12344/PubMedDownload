hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) many cellular functions major
factor hepatitis hepatocellular carcinoma caused hbv infection. a
proteomic approach used search hbx-interacting proteins order to
elucidate molecular mechanism hepatocarcinogenesis. hbx attached to
myc flag tags (mef tags) expressed 293t cells; protein complex
formed within cells purified characterized mass spectrometry. cop9
signalosome (csn) subunits 3 4 subsequently identified as
hbx-interacting proteins. addition, csn subunit 5, jun activation
domain-binding protein 1 (jab1), shown novel cellular target hbx. 
in vivo vitro interactions hbx jab1 confirmed standard
immunoprecipitation gst pull-down assays. analysis hbx deletion
constructs showed amino acids 30-125 hbx responsible binding 
jab1. confocal laser microscopy demonstrated hbx mainly localized the
cytoplasm, jab1 found mainly nucleus partially the
cytoplasm, two proteins colocalized cytoplasm. the
cotransfection hbx jab1 resulted substantial activator protein 1 (ap-1)
activation knockdown endogenous jab1 attenuated ap-1 activation caused 
hbx. addition, coexpression hbx jab1 potentiated phosphorylation of
jnk, leading subsequent phosphorylation c-jun, whereas level of
c-jun jnk phosphorylation induced hbx decreased jab1 knockdown
cells. results suggest interaction hbx jab1 enhances
hbx-mediated ap-1 activation.
