background: yellow fever virus (yfv) belongs flavivirus genus causes
an important disease. alarming resurgence viral circulation the
expansion yfv-endemic zones detected africa south america 
recent years. ns5 viral protein contains methyltransferase and
rna-dependent rna polymerase (rdrp) domains, essential viral
replication, interactions ns5 cellular proteins been
studied better understand viral replication. aim study to
characterize interaction ns5 protein eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 3 subunit l (eif3l) evaluate role eif3l yellow
fever replication.
methods: identify interactions yfv ns5 cellular proteins, performed
a two-hybrid screen using yfv ns5 rdrp domain bait human cdna
library, rnapol deletion mutants generated analyzed using the
two-hybrid system mapping interactions. rnapol region involved was
segmented three fragments analyzed using eif3l-expressing yeast
strain. map ns5 residues critical interactions, we
performed site-direct mutagenesis segment 3 interaction domain (id) and
confirmed interaction using vitro assays vivo
coimmunoprecipitation. significance eif3l yfv replication was
investigated using eif3l overexpression rna interference.
results: work, describe characterize interaction ns5 with
the translation factor eif3l. interaction ns5 eif3l confirmed
using vitro binding vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. interaction
occurs region (the interaction domain rnapol domain) is
conserved several flaviviruses is, therefore, likely relevant
to genus. eif3l overexpression plaque reduction assays showed slight
effect yfv replication, indicating interaction eif3l yfv ns5 
may play role yfv replication.
conclusions: although precise function eif3l interactions viral
proteins entirely understood, results indicate interaction of
eif3l yf ns5 eif3l overexpression facilitates translation, which
has potential implications virus replication.
