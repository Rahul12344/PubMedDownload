viral proteins frequently multifunctional accommodate high density 
information encoded viral genomes. matrix (m) protein negative-stranded rna
viruses rhabdoviridae one example. primary function virus 
assembly/budding also involved switch viral transcription
to replication concomitant regulation host gene expression. in
this study undertook search potential rabies virus (rv) protein's
cellular partners. yeast two-hybrid screen eif3h subunit identified 
as m-interacting cellular factor, interaction validated by
co-immunoprecipitation surface plasmon resonance assays. upon expression in
mammalian cell cultures, rv protein localized early small ribosomal
subunit fractions. further, protein added trans inhibited vitro
translation mrna encompassing classical (kozak-like) 5'-utrs. interestingly,
translation hepatitis c virus ires-containing mrna, recruits eif3 via 
different noncanonical mechanism, unaffected. together, data suggest
that, complement functions virus assembly/budding regulation
of viral transcription, rv protein plays role inhibiting translation in
virus-infected cells protein-protein interaction cellular
translation machinery.
