epstein-barr virus (ebv)-induced b-cell growth transformation, central feature 
of virus' strategy colonizing human b-cell system, requires full
virus latent gene expression initiated transcription viral
promoter wp. interestingly, ebv accesses cell types, this
growth-transforming program activated. present work focuses a
region wp reporter assays confers b-cell-specific activity. bandshift
studies indicate region contains three factor binding sites, termed
sites b, c, d, addition previously characterized creb site. we
show site c binds members ubiquitously expressed rfx family of
proteins, notably rfx1, rfx3, associated factor mibp1, whereas sites b
and bind b-cell-specific activator protein bsap/pax5. reporter
assays mutant wp constructs, loss factor binding one 
sites severely impaired promoter activity b cells, wild-type
promoter could activated non-b cells ectopic bsap expression. suggest
that wp regulation bsap helps ensure b-cell specificity ebv's
growth-transforming function.
