latent epstein-barr virus (ebv) infection strongly associated several
cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (npc), tumor endemic in
several parts world. investigated molecular basis ebv 
latent infection promotes development npc. show viral ebna1
protein, previously known required maintain ebv episomes, also
causes disruption cellular pml (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies
(or nd10s). disruption occurs context native latent
infection exogenously expressed ebv-negative npc cells involves
loss pml proteins. also show ebna1 partially localized pml
nuclear bodies npc cells interacts specific pml isoform. pml
disruption ebna1 requires binding cellular ubiquitin specific protease,
usp7 hausp, independent p53. observed p53
activation, dna repair apoptosis, depend pml nuclear bodies, 
were impaired ebna1 expression cells expressing ebna1 more
likely survive induction dna damage. results point an
important role ebna1 development npc, ebna1-mediated
disruption pml nuclear bodies promotes survival cells dna damage.
