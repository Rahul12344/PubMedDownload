rotavirus spike protein vp4 implicated several important functions, as
cell attachment, penetration, hemagglutination, neutralization, virulence, and
host range. present plasma membrane colocalizes the
cytoskeleton infected cells. looked cellular partners responsible for
the localization vp4 two-hybrid screening monkey cv1 cell cdna
library. screen isolated repeatedly three cdnas encoding either two
isoforms (a c) rab5 protein prenylated rab acceptor (pra1). the
small gtpase rab5 molecule regulating vesicular traffic motility
of early endosomes along microtubules. rab5 interacts large number of
effectors, particular pra1. interactions vp4 partners, rab5 
and pra1, confirmed coimmunoprecipitation infected- or
transfected-cell lysates. interaction rab5 pra1 restricted free
vp4, since neither triple-layered particles nsp4-vp4-vp7 heterotrimeric
complexes could coprecipitated. site-directed deletion mutants vp4 were
used map vp4 domain(s) interacting rab5 pra1. 10 mutants
tested, 2 interacted exclusively single partner. contrast, domain
extending amino acids 560 722 vp4 essential interactions. 
these results suggest rab5 pra1 may involved localization 
trafficking vp4 infected cells.
