herpes simplex viruses (hsvs) able hijack host-cell ikappab kinase
(ikk)/nf-kappab pathway, regulates critical cell functions apoptosis
to inflammatory responses; however, molecular mechanisms involved the
outcome signaling dysregulation host-virus interaction mostly
unknown. show human keratinocytes hsv-1 attains sophisticated
control ikk/nf-kappab pathway, inducing two distinct temporally controlled
waves ikk activity disrupting nf-kappab autoregulatory mechanism.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate dysregulation the
nf-kappab-response mediated virus-induced block nf-kappab recruitment 
to promoter ikappabalpha gene, encoding main nf-kappab-inhibitor. 
we also show hsv-1 redirects nf-kappab recruitment promoter icp0, 
an immediate-early viral gene key role promoting virus replication. the
results reveal new level control cellular functions invading viruses
and suggest persistent nf-kappab activation hsv-1-infected cells, rather 
than host response virus, may play positive role promoting
efficient viral replication.
