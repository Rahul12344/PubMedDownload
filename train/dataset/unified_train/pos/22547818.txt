the notch signaling pathway key determinant keratinocyte differentiation 
and growth cycle arrest, reported tumor suppressor
function skin. papillomavirus life cycle intricately linked the
differentiation status keratinocytes. papillomaviruses associated with
benign proliferative epithelial lesions respective hosts. although human
papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated genital tract lesions been
extensively studied, studies cutaneous hpvs limited. in
particular, well established e6 proteins high-risk hpvs 
α-genus hpv16 hpv18 mediate degradation p53 association
with ubiquitin ligase e6ap. contrast, less known cellular
activities cutaneous hpvs β-genus. using unbiased proteomic
approach, identify maml1 members notch transcription complex 
as high-confidence cellular interacting proteins e6 proteins β-genus
hpvs bovine papillomavirus type 1 associated cutaneous
fibropapillomas. show bovine papillomavirus type 1 β-hpv e6 repress
notch transcriptional activation, repression dependent an
interaction maml1. finally, show expression levels endogenous
notch target genes repressed β-hpv e6 proteins. findings elucidate a
mechanism viral antagonism notch signaling, suggest notch
signaling important epithelial cell pathway target β-hpvs.
