one interesting functions attributed adenovirus early region 4
open reading frame 3 (e4 orf3) protein reorganization promyelocytic
leukemia (pml) protein nuclear bodies. normally punctate structures are
reorganized e4 orf3 tracks eventually surround viral replication
centers. pml rearrangement evolutionarily conserved function e4 orf3,
yet cause functional relevance remain mysteries. e4 orf3 protein
coimmunoprecipitates pml protein, yet e4 orf3 still forms tracks in
cells lack pml. pml protein member larger protein family
termed tripartite motif (trim) proteins. trim proteins contain tripartite
domain structure proximity n termini consists ring finger
domain, followed one two b box domains c-terminal coiled-coil domain 
(collectively termed rbcc domain). order spacing domains are
evolutionarily conserved thought mediate protein-protein interactions 
other functions. implemented proteomic approach isolate cellular proteins
that bind e4 orf3. identified novel interaction e4 orf3 and
another trim family member, transcriptional intermediary factor 1 alpha
(tif1alpha). tif1alpha functions recruiting coactivators and/or corepressors
to modulate transcription. interaction e4 orf3 tif1alpha was
validated coimmunoprecipitation binding recombinant proteins. indirect 
immunofluorescence assays demonstrated tif1alpha reorganized track
structures contain pml upon e4 orf3 expression. rbcc domain tif1alpha
is sufficient e4 orf3-induced rearrangement, tif1alpha reorganization 
conserved across adenovirus serotypes.
