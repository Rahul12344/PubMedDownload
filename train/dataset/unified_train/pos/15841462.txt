the persistent nature hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection suggests hcv
encodes proteins enable overcome host antiviral responses. toll-like
receptor 3 (tlr3)-mediated signaling, recognizes double-stranded rna
that produced viral replication induces type interferons,
including interferon beta (ifn-beta), crucial host defense against
viruses. recent studies suggest tir domain-containing adaptor protein,
trif, two protein kinases, tank-binding kinase-1 (tbk1) ikappab
kinase-epsilon (ikkepsilon), play essential roles tlr3-mediated ifn-beta
production activation transcriptional factor interferon
regulatory factor 3 (irf-3). report hcv ns3 protein interacts
directly tbk1, binding results inhibition the
association tbk1 irf-3, leads inhibition irf-3
activation. conclusion, results suggest mechanisms inhibition
of innate immune responses hcv infection ns3 protein.
