the vaccinia virus (vacv) a41l gene encodes secreted 30 kda glycoprotein that
is nonessential virus replication affects host response infection.
the a41 protein shares sequence similarity another vacv protein binds
cc chemokines (called vckbp, viral cc chemokine inhibitor, vcci), strains 
of vacv lacking a41l gene induced stronger cd8+ t-cell responses control
viruses expressing a41. using surface plasmon resonance, screened 39 human and
murine chemokines identified ccl21, ccl25, ccl26 ccl28 a41 ligands,
with kds 8 nm 118 nm. nonetheless, a41 ineffective at
inhibiting chemotaxis induced chemokines, indicating block
the interaction chemokines receptors. however interaction
of a41 chemokines inhibited dose-dependent manner heparin,
suggesting a41 heparin bind overlapping sites chemokines. to
better understand mechanism action a41 crystal structure solved
to 1.9 resolution. protein globular beta sandwich structure similar
to poxvirus vcci family proteins, notable structural
differences, particularly surface loops electrostatic charge distribution.
structural modelling suggests binding paradigm defined the
vcci-chemokine interaction likely conserved a41 its
chemokine partners. additionally, sequence analysis chemokines binding a41 
identified signature a41 binding. biological structural data
suggest a41 functions forming moderately strong (nm) interactions with
certain chemokines, sufficient interfere chemokine-glycosaminoglycan
interactions cell surface (microm-nm) thereby destroy chemokine
concentration gradient, strong enough disrupt (pm)
chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions.
