toll-like receptor 3 (tlr3) cytosolic rig-i-like helicases (rig-i mda5)
sense viral rnas activate innate immune signaling pathways induce
expression interferon (ifn) specific adaptor proteins, tir
domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (trif), mitochondrial
antiviral signaling protein (mavs), respectively. previously, demonstrated
that hepatitis virus (hav), unique hepatotropic human picornavirus, disrupts 
rig-i/mda5 signaling targeting mavs cleavage 3abc, precursor the
sole hav protease, 3c(pro), derived auto-processing p3 (3abcd) 
segment viral polyprotein. here, show hav also disrupts tlr3
signaling, inhibiting poly(i:c)-stimulated dimerization ifn regulatory factor 
3 (irf-3), irf-3 translocation nucleus, ifn-β promoter activation, 
targeting trif degradation distinct 3abcd processing intermediate, the
3cd protease-polymerase precursor. trif proteolytically cleaved 3cd, but
not mature 3c(pro) protease 3abc precursor degrades mavs.
3cd-mediated degradation trif depends cysteine protease activity
of 3c(pro) downstream 3d(pol) sequence, 3d(pol) polymerase activity. 
cleavage occurs two non-canonical 3c(pro) recognition sequences trif, and
involves hierarchical process primary cleavage gln-554 a
prerequisite scission gln-190. results mutational studies indicate 
that 3d(pol) sequence modulates substrate specificity upstream 3c(pro)
protease fused cis 3cd, allowing 3cd target cleavage sites
not normally recognized 3c(pro). hav thus disrupts rig-i/mda5 tlr3
signaling pathways cleavage essential adaptor proteins two distinct
protease precursors derived common 3abcd polyprotein processing
intermediate.
