viral infections frequently cause endoplasmic reticulum (er) stress host cells
leading stimulation er-associated degradation (erad) pathway, which
subsequently targets unassembled glycoproteins ubiquitylation proteasomal
degradation. however, role erad pathway viral life cycle is
poorly defined. paper, demonstrate hepatitis c virus (hcv)
infection activates erad pathway, turn controls fate viral
glycoproteins modulates virus production. erad proteins, edem1 and
edem3, found increase ubiquitylation hcv envelope proteins via direct 
physical interaction. knocking edem1 edem3 increased half-life of
hcv e2, well virus production, whereas exogenous expression these
proteins reduced production infectious virus particles. further
investigation revealed edem1 edem3 bind sel1l, er membrane 
adaptor protein involved translocation erad substrates er the
cytoplasm. hcv-infected cells treated kifunensine, potent
inhibitor erad pathway, half-life hcv e2 increased virus
production. kifunensine inhibited binding edem1 edem3 sel1l, thus
blocking ubiquitylation hcv e2 protein. chemical inhibition erad
pathway neither affected production japanese encephalitis virus (jev) 
stability jev envelope protein. co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that
edem orthologs bind jev envelope protein. findings highlight
the crucial role erad pathway life cycle specific viruses.
