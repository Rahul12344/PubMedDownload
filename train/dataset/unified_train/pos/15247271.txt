alpha-, beta-, gamma-herpesviruses encode putative viral protein kinases. the
herpes simplex virus ul13, varicella-zoster virus orf47, epstein-barr virus
bglf4 genes show protein kinase domains protein sequences.
mutational analysis herpesviruses demonstrated viral kinase 
important optimal virus growth. previous studies shown orf36 of
kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (kshv) protein kinase activity is
autophosphorylated serine. gene orf36 expressed lytic growth
of virus classified late gene. inspection orf36
sequence indicated potential motifs could involved activation of
cellular transcription factors. analyze function orf36, cdna for
this viral gene tagged flag epitope inserted expression 
vector mammalian cells. transfection experiments 293t slk cells
demonstrated expression orf36 resulted phosphorylation c-jun
n-terminal kinase. autophosphorylation orf36 important jnk activation
because mutation predicted catalytic domain orf36 blocked ability
to phosphorylate jnk. western blot analysis, using phosphospecific antibodies,
revealed mitogen-activated kinases mkk4 mkk7 phosphorylated by
orf36 kinase-negative mutant. binding experiments transfected
cells also demonstrated wild type kinase-negative mutant of
orf36 form complex jnk, mkk4, mkk7. addition, using a
tetracycline-inducible rta bcbl-1 cell line (trex bcbl1-rta), jnk was
phosphorylated lytic replication, inhibition jnk activation blocked
late viral gene expression early viral gene expression. summary, these
studies demonstrate kshv orf36 activates jnk pathway; thus cell
signaling pathway may function kshv life cycle regulating viral and/or 
cellular transcription.
