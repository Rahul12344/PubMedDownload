background: hepatitis virus (hav), atypical picornaviridae causes acute
hepatitis humans, usurps hav cellular receptor 1 (havcr1) infect cells.
havcr1 class 1 integral membrane glycoprotein contains two
extracellular domains: virus-binding immunoglobulin-like (igv) domain a
mucin-like domain extends igv cell membrane. soluble forms of
havcr1 bind, alter, neutralize cell culture-adapted hav, attenuated 
for humans. however, requirements hav-havcr1 interaction been
fully characterized, determined whether havcr1 also serves as
a receptor wild-type (wt) hav. here, used hav soluble receptor
neutralization alteration assays study requirements hav-havcr1 
interaction determine whether havcr1 also receptor wt hav.
results: treatment hav soluble form havcr1 contained igv
and two-thirds mucin domain fused fc fragment human igg1 (d1
muc-fc), altered particles 37 degrees c left residual level unaltered
particles 4 degrees c. kinetics neutralization hav d1 muc-fc 
faster 37 degrees c 4 degrees c. alteration hav particles d1
muc-fc required ca, could replaced li, na, mg, mn, zn.
neutralization hav d1 muc-fc occurred ph 5 8 efficient
at ph 6 7. d1 muc-fc neutralized wt hav determined cell culture system
that allows growth wt hav.
conclusion: interaction hav soluble forms havcr1 shares the
temperature, ca, ph requirements infectivity cell culture and
therefore mimics cell entry process hav. since soluble forms havcr1
also neutralized wt hav, receptor may play significant role in
pathogenesis hav.
