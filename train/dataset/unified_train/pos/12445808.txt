by using yeast two-hybrid assay, cyclic amp-response-element-binding
protein-related protein (creb-rp), also called activating transcription factor
6beta (atf6beta), identified cellular protein interacts the
ns4b protein hepatitis c virus. n-terminal half ns4b central
portion creb-rp/atf6beta containing basic leucine zipper (bzip) domain
were involved interaction. interaction ns4b and
creb-rp/atf6beta demonstrated also mammalian cells by
co-immunoprecipitation confocal microscopic analyses using specific
antibodies. bzip domain atf6alpha, shares high sequence similarity
with creb-rp/atf6beta, also shown interact ns4b yeast although the
interaction weaker ns4b creb-rp/atf6beta.
creb-rp/atf6beta atf6alpha known endoplasmic reticulum (er)
stress-induced transcription factors. collectively, results imply the
possibility ns4b modulates certain cellular responses upon er stress through
the physical interaction creb-rp/atf6beta atf6alpha.
