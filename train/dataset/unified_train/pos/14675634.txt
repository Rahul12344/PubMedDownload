the genital human papillomaviruses (hpvs) taxonomic group including hpv
types preferentially cause genital laryngeal warts ("low-risk types"),
such hpv-6 hpv-11, cancer cervix precursor lesions
("high-risk types"), hpv-16. transforming processes induced 
viruses depend proteins e5, e6, e7. among oncoproteins, e6
protein stands supports particularly large number functions
and interactions cellular proteins, specific the
carcinogenic hpvs, others shared among low- high-risk hpvs. we
report yeast two-hybrid screens hpv-6 -11 e6 proteins identified
trip-br1 novel cellular target. trip-br1 recently detected two
research groups, described two separate functions, namely a
transcriptional integrator e2f1/dp1/rb cell-cycle regulatory pathway (and 
then named trip-br1), antagonist cyclin-dependent kinase
suppression p16ink4a (and named p34sei-1). observed trip-br1
interacts low- high-risk hpv e6 proteins yeast, vitro in
mammalian cell cultures. transcription activation complex consisting of
e2f1, dp1, trip-br1 efficiently stimulated e6 proteins. trip-br1 
has llg e6 interaction motif, contributed binding e6 proteins.
apparently, e6 promote degradation trip-br1. observations imply
that cell-cycle promoting transcription factor e2f1/dp1 dually targeted by
hpv oncoproteins, namely (i) interference e7 protein repression by
rb, (ii) transcriptional cofactor function e6 protein. data
reveal natural context transcription activator function e6, which
has predicted without knowledge e2f1/dp1/trip-br/e6 complex by
studying chimeric constructs, add function limited number of
transforming properties shared low- high-risk hpvs.
