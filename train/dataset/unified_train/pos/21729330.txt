background: classical swine fever virus (csfv) member genus
pestivirus family flaviviridae. 5' untranslated region (utr) of
csfv contains ires, highly structured element recruits the
translation machinery. 3' utr usually recognition site viral
replicase initiate minus-strand rna synthesis. adenosine-uridine rich elements
(are) instability determinants present 3' utr short-lived mrnas.
however, presence ares 3' utr csfv conserved known
strains never reported. study inspects possible role are
in 3' utr csfv.
results: using rna pull-down lc/ms/ms assays, study identified least 
32 possible host factors derived cytoplasmic extracts pk-15 cells
that bind csfv 3' utr, one hur. hur known bind ares 
and protect mrna degradation. using recombinant gst-hur, study
demonstrates hur binds present 3' utr csfv vitro and
that binding ability conserved strains irrespective virulence.
conclusions: study identified one csfv 3' utr binding proteins hur is
specifically binding region.
