human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression regulated an
enhancer region composed multiple potential cis-acting regulatory sites. here,
we describe binding sites transcription factor ap-2 hiv-1 long
terminal repeat modulate hiv enhancer function. one site embedded within
the two previously described kappa b elements, second site detected
further downstream. dnase footprinting electrophoretic mobility shift assay
experiments demonstrated ap-2 binds site kappa b
elements. interestingly, ap-2 nf-kappa b bind region mutually
exclusive manner. mutations disrupt ap-2-binding site lower basal
levels transcription affect nf-kappa b-mediated induction tumor 
necrosis factor alpha jurkat leukemia cells.
