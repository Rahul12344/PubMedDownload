chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection major risk factor developing
hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), hbv x protein (hbx) acts cofactor in
hepatocarcinogenesis. liver tumors animals modeling hbx- hbv-mediated
hepatocarcinogenesis, downregulation chromatin regulating proteins suz12 and
znf198 induces expression several genes, including epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (epcam). epcam upregulation occurs hbv-mediated hccs hepatic
cancer stem cells, mechanism understood. herein demonstrate hbx
induces epcam expression via active dna demethylation. hepatocytes, epcam is
silenced polycomb repressive complex 2 (prc2) znf198/lsd1/co-rest/hdac1
chromatin-modifying complexes. cells stable knockdown suz12, essential
prc2 subunit, upon hbx expression demethylate cpg dinucleotide located adjacent
to nf-κb/rela half-site. nf-κb/rela site cpg island downstream 
epcam transcriptional start site (tss). chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip)
assays demonstrate hbx-dependent rela occupancy nf-κb half-site, whereas rela 
knockdown suppresses cpg demethylation epcam expression. tumor necrosis
factor-α activates rela, propagating demethylation nearby cpg sites, shown 
sodium bisulfite sequencing. rela-dependent demethylation occurring upon hbx
expression requires methyltrasferase ezh2, tet2 key factor cytosine
demethylation inactive dnmt3l, shown knockdown assays sodium bisulfite
sequencing. co-immunoprecipitations sequential chip assays demonstrate that
rela presence hbx forms complex ezh2, tet2 dnmt3l, although 
the role dnmt3l remains understood. interestingly, human epcam gene 
also cpg island downstream tss, nf-κb-binding site flanked
by cpgs. hepg2 cells derived human hcc exhibit demethylation these
nf-κb-flanking cpg sites, hbv replication propagates demethylation nearby 
cpg sites. dlk1, another prc2 target gene, also upregulated hbv-mediated hccs,
is demethylated liver tumors cpg dinucleotides flanking nf-κb-binding
sequence, supporting active dna demethylation mechanism functions
during oncogenic transformation.
