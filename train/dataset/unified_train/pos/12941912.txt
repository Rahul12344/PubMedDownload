expression human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) genes is
transcriptionally activated cognate oncoprotein tax enhances the
binding cyclin amp-responsive element binding protein (creb) tax
responsive element (txre) located long terminal repeat (ltr). txre is
highly homologous cyclic amp-responsive element (cre) except the
gc-rich sequence flanking cre. cloned cdna cellular factor,
taxreb803, dna-binding domain bound txre binding was
dependent 3' gc-rich sequence txre. taxreb803 sr-related protein 
composed 2,752 amino acids including numerous arginine/serine (rs) motifs.
taxreb803 enhanced tax dependent transcription creb binding to
txre cooperation tax. interaction taxreb803 tax detected
by coimmunoprecipitation assays well indirect immunofluorescence assays.
significantly, tax transactivation htlv-1 ltr decreased dramatically when
the expression level endogenous taxreb803 suppressed small
interfering rna. results suggest taxreb803 functions a
transcriptional coactivator tax plays critical role expression
of htlv-1 genes.
