sindbis virus (sinv) one almost 30 currently known alphaviruses. in
infected cells, produces proteins function virus
replication interfere development antiviral response. one 
the viral nonstructural proteins, nsp2, exhibits protease rna
helicase activities directly involved viral rna replication also 
plays critical roles development transcriptional translational
shutoffs sinv-infected cells. multiple activities nsp2 complicate
investigations protein's functions understanding its
structure. using transposon-based approach, generated cdna library sinv
genomes green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene randomly inserted nsp2
and identified number sites used gfp cloning without a
strong effect virus replication. recombinant sin viruses encoding nsp2/gfp
chimeric protein capable growth tissue culture interfering with
cellular functions. sinv, expressing gfp nsp2, used isolate
nsp2-specific protein complexes formed cytoplasm infected cells.
these complexes contained viral nsps, cellular proteins we
previously coisolated sinv nsp3, additional protein factors that
were found detectable concentrations. random insertion
library-based approach, followed selection viable variants
expressing heterologous proteins, applied mapping domain structure
of viral nonstructural structural proteins, cloning peptide tags for
isolation protein-specific complexes, studying formation by
using live-cell imaging. approach may also applicable presentation 
additional antigens retargeting viruses new receptors.
