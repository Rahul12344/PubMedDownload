gene expression visna virus highly restricted monocytes, induced 
when monocytes differentiate macrophages. previous study differential
regulation visna virus gene expression revealed specific ap-1 site in
the long terminal repeat viral dna required phorbol-ester-induced
gene expression macrophages (gabuzda, hess, small, clements, mol. cell.
biol., 9, 2728-2733). present investigation, examined association
of two dna binding proteins, proto-oncogene proteins fos jun, this
ap-1 site visna virus ltr. demonstrated concentrations of
these two proteins mrnas increased u937 cells phorbol ester
induction. furthermore, binding cellular proteins u937 nuclear
extracts ap-1 site significantly decreased presence of
antibodies jun fos. vitro-translated jun protein also binds this
ap-1 sequence, binding enhanced fos protein. results
indicate jun fos directly involved differential regulation of
visna virus gene expression.
