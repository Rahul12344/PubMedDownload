flaviviral infections produce distinct array virus-induced intracellular
membrane alterations associated flaviviral replication
machinery. currently, still unknown flaviviral protein(s) is/are
responsible induction. using yeast two-hybrid co-immunoprecipitation
analyses, demonstrated ns3 protein dengue virus type 2 interacted 
specifically nuclear receptor binding protein (nrbp), host cellular
protein influences trafficking endoplasmic reticulum (er) and
golgi, interacts rac3, member rho-gtpase family.
co-expression ns3 nrbp baby hamster kidney cells exhibited significant 
subcellular co-localization, revealed redistribution nrbp the
cytoplasm perinuclear region. furthermore, set membrane structures
affiliated rough er perinuclear region induced cells
transfected ns3. structures reminiscent virus-induced
convoluted membranes previously observed flavivirus-infected cells. this
interaction dengue viral host cell proteins well formation 
of ns3-induced membrane structures suggest ns3 may subvert role of
nrbp er-golgi trafficking.
