previously, reported mitochondrial translocator protein (tspo)
induces hiv-1 envelope (env) degradation via endoplasmic reticulum
(er)-associated protein degradation (erad) pathway, mechanism not
clear. investigated four er-associated glycoside hydrolase family
47 (gh47) α-mannosidases, ermani, er-degradation enhancing α-mannosidase-like
(edem) proteins 1, 2, 3, involved env degradation process. ectopic
expression four α-mannosidases uncovers ermani inhibits hiv-1 
env expression dose-dependent manner. addition, genetic knock-out 
ermani gene man1b1 using crispr/cas9 technology disrupts tspo-mediated env
degradation. biochemical studies show hiv-1 env interacts ermani, and
between ermani cytoplasmic, transmembrane, lumenal stem, lumenal
catalytic domains, catalytic domain plays critical role env-ermani
interaction. addition, functional studies show inactivation the
catalytic sites site-directed mutagenesis disrupts ermani activity. 
studies identify ermani critical gh47 α-mannosidase er-associated
protein degradation pathway initiates env degradation suggests 
its catalytic domain enzymatic activity play important role this
process.
