the non-structural protein 4b (ns4b) hepatitis c virus (hcv) an
endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane protein comprising two consecutive
amphipathic α-helical domains (ah1 ah2). self-oligomerization via ah2
domain required formation membranous web necessary 
viral replication. previously, reported host-encoded er-associated
reticulon 3 (rtn3) protein involved formation the
replication-associated membranes (+)rna enteroviruses viral
replication. study, demonstrated second transmembrane region 
of rtn3 competed for, bound to, ah2 domain ns4b, thus abolishing ns4b 
self-interaction leading downregulation viral replication. this
interaction mediated two crucial residues, lysine 52 tyrosine 63, of
ah2, regulated ah1 domain. silencing rtn3 huh7 ava5 
cells harbouring hcv replicon enhanced replication hcv, was
counteracted overexpression recombinant rtn3. synthesis viral
rna also increased sirna-transfected human primary hepatocytes infected
with hcv derived cell culture. results demonstrated rtn3 acted a
restriction factor limit replication hcv.
