proteomic identification human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv16) e6-interacting
proteins revealed several proteins involved ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. in
addition well-characterized e6ap ubiquitin-protein ligase, second hect
domain protein (herc2) deubiquitylating enzyme (usp15) identified by
tandem affinity purification hpv16 e6-associated proteins. study focuses 
on functional consequences interaction e6 usp15.
overexpression usp15 resulted increased levels e6 protein, the
small interfering rna-mediated knockdown usp15 decreased e6 protein levels.
these results implicate usp15 directly regulation e6 protein stability 
and suggest ubiquitylated e6 could substrate usp15 ubiquitin
peptidase activity. remains possible e6 could affect activity of
usp15 specific cellular substrates, hypothesis tested is
learned substrates pathways controlled usp15.
