kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) etiologically associated with
the angioproliferative kaposi's sarcoma (ks). kshv infection expression
of latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana-1) upregulates angiogenic
multifunctional 123-amino-acid, 14-kda protein angiogenin (ang), is
detected ks lesions kshv-associated primary effusion lymphoma (pel)
cells. ang knockdown inhibition ang's nuclear translocation resulted in
decreased lana-1 gene expression reduced kshv-infected endothelial pel
cell survival (sadagopan et al., j. virol. 83:3342-3364, 2009). studies
here demonstrate lana-1 ang colocalize coimmunoprecipitate de
novo infected endothelial cells latently infected pel (bcbl-1 bc-3)
cells. lana-1 ang interaction occurred absence kshv genome 
other viral proteins. gel filtration chromatography analyses bc-3 cell
lysates, ang coeluted lana-1, p53, mdm2 high-molecular-weight
fractions, lana-1, p53, mdm2 also coimmunoprecipitated ang. lana-1, 
ang, p53 colocalized kshv-infected cells, colocalization ang
and p53 also observed lana-1-negative cells. deletion constructs of
ang suggested c-terminal region amino acids 104 123 involved in
lana-1 p53 interactions. silencing ang inhibiting nuclear
translocation resulted decreased nuclear lana-1 ang levels, decreased
interactions ang-lana-1, ang-p53, lana-1-p53, induction p53,
p21, bax proteins, increased cytoplasmic localization p53, the
downregulation bcl-2, increased cleavage caspase-3, apoptosis
of cells. effects observed kshv-negative bjab cells. the
phosphorylation p53 serine 15, essential p53 stabilization and
for p53's apoptotic cell cycle regulation functions, increased bcbl-1 
cells transduced short hairpin rna targeting ang. together, studies
suggest antiapoptosis observed kshv-infected cells the
suppression p53 functions mediated part ang, kshv probably
evolved utilize angiogenin's multiple functions maintenance its
latency cell survival. thus, targeting ang induce apoptosis cells
latently infected kshv attractive therapeutic strategy kshv
infection associated malignancies.
