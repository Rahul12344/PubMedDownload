expression human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) regulated the
viral transcriptional activator tax. tax activates viral transcription through
interaction cellular transcription factor creb coactivators
cbp/p300. study, analyzed role histone deacetylase 1
(hdac1) htlv-1 gene expression integrated template. first show that
trichostatin a, hdac inhibitor, enhances tax expression htlv-1-transformed 
cells. second, using cell line containing single-copy htlv-1 long terminal
repeat, demonstrate overexpression hdac1 represses tax
transactivation. furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay allowed us to
analyze interaction transcription factors, coactivators, hdacs with
the basal activated htlv-1 promoter. demonstrate hdac1 associated 
with inactive, tax-transactivated, htlv-1 promoter. vitro 
in vivo glutathione s-transferase-tax pull-down coimmunoprecipitation
experiments demonstrated direct physical association tax 
and hdac1. importantly, biotinylated chromatin pull-down assays demonstrated that
tax inhibits and/or dissociates binding hdac1 htlv-1 promoter. 
results provide evidence tax interacts directly hdac1 regulates
binding repressor htlv-1 promoter.
