alphaviruses represent serious public health threat cause wide variety of
diseases, ranging severe encephalitis, result death or
neurological sequelae, mild infection, characterized fever, skin rashes,
and arthritis. infected cells, alphaviruses express four
nonstructural proteins, function synthesis virus-specific rnas
and modification intracellular environment. results study
suggest sindbis virus (sinv) infection bhk-21 cells leads the
formation least two types nsp3-containing complexes, one was
found association plasma membrane endosome-like vesicles, while
the second coisolated cell nuclei. latter complexes could be
solubilized cytoskeleton-destabilizing detergent. besides viral
nsps, mammalian cells, complexes contained g3bp1 g3bp2 (which
were found different ratios), ybx1, hsc70. rasputin, insect
cell-specific homolog g3bp1, found nsp3-containing complexes
isolated mosquito cells, suggestive high conservation 
complexes cells vertebrate invertebrate origin. endosome- 
and plasma membrane-associated complexes contained high concentration of
double-stranded rnas (dsrnas), indicative function viral-rna
synthesis. dsrna synthesis likely efficiently proceed plasma
membrane, least protein-rna complexes would be
transported cytosol association endosome-like vesicular
organelles. findings provide new insight mechanism sinv
replication virus-host cell interactions.
