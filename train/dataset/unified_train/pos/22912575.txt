major human pathologies caused nuclear replicative viruses establishing
life-long latent infection host. latency genomes these
viruses intimately interacting cell nucleus environment. hallmark 
of herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) latency establishment shutdown of
lytic genes expression concomitant induction latency associated
(lat) transcripts. although setting maintenance latent
genetic program likely dependent subtle interplay viral 
nuclear factors, remains uninvestigated. combining use situ
fluorescent-based approaches high-resolution microscopic analysis, show
that hsv-1 genomes adopt specific nuclear patterns sensory neurons latently
infected mice (28 days post-inoculation, d.p.i.). latent hsv-1 genomes display
two major patterns, called "single" "multiple", associate with
centromeres, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (pml-nbs) viral
dna-containing pml-nbs (dcp-nbs). 3d-image reconstruction dcp-nbs shows that
pml forms shell around viral genomes associated daxx atrx, two pml
partners within pml-nbs. latency establishment (6 d.p.i.), infected mouse 
tgs display, level whole tg individual cells, substantial

genome copy-containing neurons. show lat expression significantly
favored within "multiple" pattern, underlines heterogeneity lat
expression dependent viral genome copy number, pattern acquisition, and
association nuclear domains. infection pml-knockout mice demonstrates
that pml/pml-nbs involved virus nuclear pattern acquisition, and
negatively regulate expression lat. study demonstrates that
nuclear domains including pml-nbs centromeres functionally involved in
the control hsv-1 latency, represent key level host/virus
interaction.
