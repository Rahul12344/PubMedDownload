the human papillomavirus (hpv) oncogene e6 shown perform multiple
functions (p53 degradation, telomerase activation, etc.) play role in
oncogenic transformation. beyond known e6 functions, undefined mechanism 
allows cellular invasion requires e6 pdz binding motif (pdzbm). here, show
that hpv type 16 (hpv16) e6 interacts induces loss protein tyrosine
phosphatase (ptpn13) pdzbm-dependent manner. ptpn13 loss induced either by
the presence e6 short hairpin rna strategy allows for
anchorage-independent growth (aig) synergy known oncogene, ras(v12),
resulting invasive growth vivo. restoring ptpn13 expression reverses aig in
cells lacking ptpn13. genomic analysis colorectal carcinoma identified
an association ptpn13 loss-of-function mutations aberrant ras
signaling. findings support correlation provide methods 
evaluation mechanisms ptpn13 loss/ras expression leads to
invasive growth, results important treatment of
hpv-related non-hpv cancer.
