the herpes simplex virus 1 icp0 regulatory protein. early infection icp0 
localizes nd10 bodies performs two functions: e3 ligase in
conjunction e2 ubch5a conjugating enzyme, degrades nd10 components
pml sp100. concurrently, suppresses silencing viral dna by
dispersing hdac1/corest/rest/lsd1 repressor complex. subsequently, icp0 is
exported cytoplasm. cells treated hdac inhibitors transfected
with irrelevant dna, export delayed dna dose-dependent fashion. here,
we follow observation icp0 binds cyclin d3 icp0 mutants
unable bind cyclin d3 exported. moreover, infected cells cdk4 is
activated, cdk2 not. report (i) cyclin d1, d2, d3 colocalize
with nd10 bodies icp0 early infection ultimately become incorporated
into viral replication compartments, (ii) cyclins partially rescues
deltaicp0 mutants, (iii) inhibition cdk4 inhibitor sequesters icp0 in
the nucleus. key finding overexpression cyclin d3 enables the
transport icp0 cytoplasm. conclude (i) icp0 facilitates the
recruitment cyclin d3 sites viral dna synthesis, (ii) its
functions completed, icp0 retained nucleus, (iii) common
signal results export icp0 cytoplasm accumulation of
a viral dna-synthesis-dependent late protein.
