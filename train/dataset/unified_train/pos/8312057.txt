we developed mab-based capture assay study association host cell
membrane proteins hiv siv. class ii mhc proteins found 
associated hiv previously described. addition molecules a
number host molecules found acquired hiv, including cd71, 
cd63, cd43, cd8. demonstrated major leukocyte adhesion
receptors lfa-1 (cd11a/cd18) cd44 also associated hiv. level 
surface expression host membrane proteins predict relative expression 
(capture efficiency) virus. use virus-susceptible indicator cells
showed assay involved host membrane protein-mediated capture of
infectious hiv siv particles. data indicate hiv siv acquire a
number host membrane proteins including adhesion receptors this
process may nonrandom. acquisition host cell adhesion receptors hiv 
and siv could profound effects biology viruses, including
binding, infectivity, tropism.
