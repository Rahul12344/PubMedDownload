accumulating evidence indicates t-cell immunoglobulin (ig) mucin domain 
(tim) proteins play critical roles viral infections. herein, report that
the tim-family proteins strongly inhibit hiv-1 release, resulting diminished
viral production replication. expression tim-1 causes hiv-1 gag mature
viral particles accumulate plasma membrane. mutation the
phosphatidylserine (ps) binding sites tim-1 abolishes ability block
hiv-1 release. tim-1, much lesser extent ps-binding deficient mutants,
induces ps flipping onto cell surface; tim-1 also found incorporated
into hiv-1 virions. importantly, tim-1 inhibits hiv-1 replication cd4-positive
jurkat cells, despite capability up-regulating cd4 promoting hiv-1
entry. addition tim-1, tim-3 tim-4 also block release hiv-1, 
well murine leukemia virus (mlv) ebola virus (ebov); knockdown 
tim-3 differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages (mdms) enhances hiv-1
production. inhibitory effects tim-family proteins virus release are
extended ps receptors, axl rage. overall, study uncovers
a novel ability tim-family proteins block release hiv-1 other
viruses interaction virion- cell-associated ps. work provides new
insights virus-cell interaction mediated tims ps receptors.
