protein important therapeutic target. allosteric inhibitors (allinis)
that engage dimer interface binding site host protein lens 
epithelium-derived growth factor (ledgf)/transcriptional coactivator p75 an
emerging class small molecule antagonists. consistent inhibition a
multivalent drug target, allinis display steep antiviral dose-response curves ex 
vivo. allinis multimerize protein concordantly block assembly with
viral dna vitro, indicating disruption two integration-associated 
functions, catalysis in-ledgf/p75 interaction, determines the
multimode mechanism allini action. demonstrate allini potency is
unexpectedly accounted late phase hiv-1 replication. the
compounds promote virion multimerization and, reminiscent class ii in
mutations, block formation electron-dense viral core inhibit
