background: hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein multi-functional viral
protein interacts several target proteins viral cellular
origin.
aim methods: gain insight mechanism action hcv core
protein, used yeast two-hybrid system identify core
protein-interacting cellular targets.
results: cdna clone encoding aspartoacylase obtained, termed
aspartoacylase 3 (acy3). interaction acy3 hcv core protein was
verified using co-immunoprecipitation assay vitro, mammalian
two-hybrid system vivo. fluorescence microscopy showed green fluorescence
protein-fused acy3 localized cytoplasm.
conclusion: data suggest acy3 hcv core binding protein, may 
play role development hcv-associated diseases.
