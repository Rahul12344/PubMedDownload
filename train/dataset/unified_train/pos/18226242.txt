background: despite large amount data available molecular
mechanisms regulate hiv-1 transcription, crucial information still
lacking interplay chromatin conformation events that
regulate initiation elongation viral transcription. transcriptional
activation, histone acetyltransferases atp-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes cooperate histone chaperones altering chromatin structure. in
particular, human nucleosome assembly protein-1 (hnap-1) known act a
histone chaperone shuttles histones h2a/h2b nucleus, assembles
nucleosomes promotes chromatin fluidity, thereby affecting transcription of
several cellular genes.
results: using proteomic screening, identified hnap-1 novel cellular
protein interacting hiv-1 tat. observed tat specifically binds
hnap1, members family factors. binding the
two proteins required integrity basic domain tat two
separable domains hnap-1 (aa 162-290 290-391). overexpression hnap-1
significantly enhanced tat-mediated activation ltr. conversely, silencing 
of protein decreased viral promoter activity. explore effects of
hnap-1 viral infection, reporter hiv-1 virus used infect cells in
which hnap-1 either overexpressed knocked-down. consistent the
gene expression results, two treatments found increase inhibit 
viral infection, respectively. finally, also observed overexpression 
of p300, known co-activator tat hnap-1, enhanced hnap-1-mediated
transcriptional activation well interaction tat.
conclusion: study reveals hiv-1 tat binds histone chaperone hnap-1
both vitro vivo shows interaction participates the
regulation tat-mediated activation viral gene expression.
