influenza viruses may cross species barriers transmit humans the
potential cause pandemics. interplay human- (pb2 627k) avian-like (pb2 
627e) influenza polymerase complexes unknown host factors been
postulated play key role interspecies transmission. here, have
identified human importin-α isoforms (α1 α7) positive regulators human-
but avian-like polymerase activity. human-like polymerase activity correlated
with efficient recruitment α1 α7 viral ribonucleoprotein complexes
(vrnps) without affecting subcellular localization. also observed that
human-like influenza virus growth impaired α1 α7 downregulated human
lung cells. mice lacking α7 less susceptible human- avian-like
influenza virus infection. thus, α1 α7 positive regulators human-like 
polymerase activity pathogenicity beyond role nuclear transport.
