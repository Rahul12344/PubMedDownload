nuclear factor (nf)-kappab major survival pathway engaged human
t-lymphotropic virus type 1 (htlv-1) tax protein. tax1 activation nf-kappab
occurs predominantly cytoplasm, tax1 binds nf-kappab essential
modulator (nemo/ikkgamma) triggers activation ikappab kinases. several
independent studies shown tax1-mediated nf-kappab activation is
dependent tax1 ubiquitination. here, identify co-immunoprecipitation
assays nemo-related protein (nrp/optineurin) binding partner tax1 in
htlv-1 infected tax1/nrp co-expressing cells. immunofluorescence studies
reveal tax1, nrp nemo colocalize golgi-associated structures. the
interaction tax1 nrp requires ubiquitin-binding activity nrp
and ubiquitination sites tax1. addition, observe nrp increases 
the ubiquitination tax1 along tax1-dependent nf-kappab signaling.
surprisingly, find addition tax1, nrp interacts cooperatively 
the tax1 binding protein tax1bp1, nrp tax1bp1 cooperate modulate 
tax1 ubiquitination nf-kappab activation. data strongly suggest the
first time nrp critical adaptor regulates assembly tax1bp1 
and post-translationally modified forms tax1, leading sustained nf-kappab
activation.
