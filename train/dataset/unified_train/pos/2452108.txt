the binding polyalbumin hepatitis b virus (hbv)-associated envelope
epitopes studied means radioimmunoprecipitation technique. hbv
particles purified sera chronic hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag) carriers labelled endogenous hbv-dna polymerase reaction.
human albumin, polymerized glutaraldehyde cross-linking, able to
precipitate (100%) labelled hbv concentrations 31.2 62.5 micrograms/ml,
in contrast monomeric albumin (hsa). event confirmed by
immune electron microscopy. addition anti-hsa mixture hbv plus
polyalbumin gave 100% precipitation wide dilution range (15.6-500
micrograms/ml). binding polyalbumin (31.2 micrograms/ml) virions was
strongly inhibited (up 98%) preincubating antibody a
glycosylation-dependent pres2 epitope hbv. accounted (up 99%) 
for polyvalent igg anti-hbs. however, antibodies group 'a' subtype 'd'
determinants, well anti-pres1 region antibodies, inhibited weakly
polyalbumin binding hbv. binding site inhibitory antibody overlaps 
probably neutralizing epitopes. findings support hypothesis that
albumin binding plays important role viral life cycle.
