background: similar viruses, viral proteins ebola virus (ebov)
interact variety host proteins replication. 7 structural
proteins encoded ebov genome, vp24 smallest multifunctional.
methods: identify host factors interact vp24 required for
ebov replication, transfected 293 cells plasmid expressing flag- and
ha-tagged vp24, immunoprecipitated host proteins bound vp24, and
analyzed immunoprecipitants use mass spectrometry.
results: 68 candidate host proteins identified, selected sec61α because
of similar intracellular localization vp24 (ie, perinuclear
region), involvement various biological functions, roles in
pathogenesis, type 2 diabetes hepatosteatosis, investigated its
possible role ebov life cycle. results suggest sec61α not
involved ebov entry, interferon antagonism vp24, nucleocapsid formation, or
budding. however, sec61α colocalized vp24 contributed ability vp24
to inhibit ebov genome transcription reduced polymerase activity ebov.
conclusions: present study indicates sec61α host protein involved
in ebov replication, specifically ebov genome transcription replication.
