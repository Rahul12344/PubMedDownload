expression human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) nef protein linked 
to decreased cell surface expression cd4 impairment signal
transduction. recently reported association nef unidentified
serine kinase provides clue nef might exert effects. considering 
the key role protein kinase c (pkc) cell activation, investigated 
possibility nef interacts pkc. results, using two approaches for
detecting interactions nef pkc isozymes jurkat cells, show that
nef interacts preferentially thetapkc. interaction nef thetapkc
is independent calcium, enhanced phospholipid activators pkc not
affected pkc pseudosubstrate peptide. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and
phytohemagglutinin stimulation jurkat cells expressing nef fails produce
the usual translocation thetapkc cytosol particulate fraction;
translocation betapkc epsilonpkc unaffected. indeed, appears 
be net loss thetapkc nef-expressing cells following stimulation. loss
of thetapkc, may result inhibition binding racks due to
nef binding, could contribute various impairments cell function
associated hiv infection nef expression.
