enteroviral infection lead dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm), major 
cause cardiovascular mortality worldwide. however, pathogenetic mechanisms
have fully elucidated. serum response factor (srf) cardiac-enriched
transcription regulator controlling expression variety target genes, 
including involved contractile apparatus immediate early
response, well micrornas silence expression cardiac regulatory 
factors. knockout srf heart results downregulation cardiac
contractile gene expression development dcm. goal study 
understand role srf enterovirus-induced cardiac dysfunction and
progression dcm. report srf cleaved following enteroviral
infection mouse heart cultured cardiomyocytes. cleavage is
accompanied impaired cardiac function downregulation cardiac-specific
contractile regulatory genes. investigation antibody epitope
mapping site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates srf cleavage occurs at
the region transactivation domain action virus-encoded
protease 2a. moreover, demonstrate cleavage srf dissociates its
transactivation domain dna-binding domain, resulting disruption of
srf-mediated gene transactivation. addition loss functional srf, finally
we report n-terminal fragment srf cleavage products also act a
dominant-negative transcription factor, likely competes native srf
for dna binding. results suggest mechanism virus infection impairs
heart function may offer new therapeutic strategy ameliorate myocardial 
damage progression dcm.
