the minor capsid protein l2 human papillomaviruses (hpvs) multiple
functions viral life cycle. although l2 required effective
invasion morphogenesis, cellular interaction partners known so
far. using yeast two-hybrid screening, identified transcription factor
tbx2 novel interaction partner hpv type 16 (hpv16) l2.
coimmunoprecipitations immunofluorescence analyses confirmed l2-tbx2
interaction revealed l2 also interacts tbx3, another member 
t-box family. transcription early genes hpv infection 
control upstream enhancer early promoter region, long control
region (lcr). promoter-reporter gene assays, observed tbx2 tbx3
repress transcription lcr effect enhanced l2.
repression hpv lcr tbx2/3 seems conserved mechanism, 
also observed lcrs different hpv types. finally, interaction tbx2 
with lcr detected chromatin immunoprecipitation, found strong
colocalization l2 tbx2 hpv16-positive cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (cin) i-ii tissue sections. results suggest tbx2/3 might
play role regulation hpv gene expression viral life cycle.
