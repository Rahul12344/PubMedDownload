nuclear export translation intron-containing viral mrnas required 
hiv-1 gene expression replication. report, provide evidence to
show ddx3 regulates translation hiv-1 mrnas. found knockdown 
of ddx3 expression effectively inhibited hiv-1 production. translation hiv-1
early regulatory proteins, tat rev, impaired ddx3-depleted cells. 
hiv-1 transcripts share highly structured 5' untranslated region (utr) with
inhibitory elements translation viral mrnas, yet ddx3 promoted translation 
of reporter mrnas containing hiv-1 5' utr, especially the
transactivation response (tar) hairpin. interestingly, ddx3 directly interacts
with hiv-1 tat, well-characterized transcriptional activator bound tar
hairpin. hiv-1 tat partially targeted cytoplasmic stress granules upon ddx3
overexpression cell stress conditions, suggesting potential role tat/ddx3
complex translation. demonstrated hiv-1 tat remains associated
with translating mrnas facilitates translation mrnas containing hiv-1 
5' utr. taken together, findings indicate ddx3 recruited tar
hairpin interaction viral tat facilitate hiv-1 mrna translation.
