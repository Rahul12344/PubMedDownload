tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) important arthropod-borne
flavivirus endemic europe etiological agent tick-borne
encephalitis, potentially fatal infection central nervous system.
however, contributions host proteins tbev infection poorly
understood. work, investigate cellular protein tia-1 its
cognate factor tiar, stress-induced rna-binding proteins involved in
the repression initiation translation cellular mrnas the
formation stress granules. show tia-1 tiar interact viral rna
in tbev-infected cells. tbev infection, cytoplasmic tia-1 tiar are
recruited sites viral replication concomitant depletion stress
granules. effect specific, since g3bp1, another component these
cytoplasmic structures, remains localized stress granules. moreover, heat
shock induction stress granules containing tia-1, g3bp1, inhibited 
in tbev-infected cells. infection cells depleted tia-1 tiar small
interfering rna (sirna) tia-1(-/-) mouse fibroblasts, leads significant
increase tbev extracellular infectivity. interestingly, tiar(-/-) fibroblasts 
show opposite effect tbev infection, phenotype appears be
related excess tia-1 cells. taking advantage a
tbe-luciferase replicon system, also observed increased luciferase activity in
tia-1(-/-) mouse fibroblasts early time points, consistent tia-1-mediated
inhibition level first round viral translation. results
indicate that, response tbev infection, tia-1 recruited sites of
virus replication bind tbev rna modulate viral translation independently
of stress granule (sg) formation.importance: study (i) extends previous work
that showed tia-1/tiar recruitment sites flavivirus replication, (ii)
demonstrates tiar behaves like tia-1 inhibitor viral replication
using rna interference (rnai) approach human cells contradicts the
previous hypothesis based mouse embryonic fibroblast (mef) knockouts only,
(iii) demonstrates tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) capable of
inducing bona fide g3bp1/eif3/eif4b-positive stress granules, (iv) demonstrates a
differential phenotype stress response proteins following viral infection, and
(v) implicates tia-1 viral translation modulator tbev replication.
