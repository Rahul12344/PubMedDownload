stabilization globular structure ferricytochrome c chloride in
acidic solvents.

stellwagen e, babul j.

increasing concentrations chloride found increase resolution
between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated acidification
of ferricytochrome c. analysis variety spectral viscosity
measurements indicates protonation single group apparent pk
of 2.1 +/- 0.2 intrinsic pk 5.3 displaces methionine ligand
without significantly perturbing native globular conformation. analysis of
methylated ferricytochrome c suggests protonation carboxylate ion, most
likely heme propionate residue, responsible displacement the
methionine ligand. addition proton second group apparent pk
of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces histidine ligand unfolds protein a
globular conformation random coil. likely second
protonation occurs imidazole ring histidine ligand itself. chloride
is proposed perturb transitions ligation fifth coordination
position heme ion. ligation stabilizes globular conformation of
ferricytochrome c ph 0.0 25 degrees.
