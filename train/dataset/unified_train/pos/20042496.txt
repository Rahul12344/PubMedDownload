aleutian mink disease virus (amdv) currently known member the
genus amdovirus family parvoviridae. etiological agent of
aleutian disease mink. previously shown small protein a
molecular mass approximately 26 kda present amdv infection and
following transfection capsid expression constructs (j. qiu, f. cheng, l. r.
burger, d. pintel, j. virol. 80:654-662, 2006). study, report that
the capsid proteins specifically cleaved aspartic acid residue 420 (d420)
during virus infection, resulting previously observed cleavage product.
mutation single amino acid residue d420 abolished specific cleavage. 
expression capsid proteins alone crandell feline kidney (crfk) cells
reproduced cleavage capsid proteins virus infection. more
importantly, capsid protein expression alone induced active caspases, which
caspase-10 active. active caspases, turn, cleaved capsid proteins
in vivo. results also showed active caspase-7 specifically cleaved
capsid proteins d420 vitro. results suggest viral capsid
proteins alone induce caspase activation, resulting cleavage capsid
proteins. also provide evidence amdv mutants resistant to
caspase-mediated capsid cleavage increased virus production approximately 3- to
5-fold crfk cells compared produced parent virus amdv-g 37
degrees c 31.8 degrees c. collectively, results indicate that
caspase activity plays multiple roles amdv infection cleavage 
capsid proteins might role regulating persistent infection amdv.
