rift valley fever infectious viral disease emerging problem many 
countries africa arabian peninsula. causative virus is
predominantly transmitted mosquitoes high mortality abortion rates
characterize outbreaks animals symptoms ranging mild to
life-threatening encephalitis hemorrhagic fever noticed among infected
humans. better prevention treatment infection, increased
knowledge infectious process virus required. focus this
work identify protein-protein interactions non-structural
protein (nsm), encoded m-segment virus, host cell proteins.
this study initiated screening approximately 26 million cdna clones a
mouse embryonic cdna library interactions nsm protein using yeast 
two-hybrid system. identified nine murine proteins interact nsm
protein rift valley fever virus, putative protein-protein interactions
were confirmed growth selection procedures β-gal activity measurements.
our results suggest cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor
subunit 2 (cpsf2), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (cyclophilin)-like 2
protein (ppil2), synaptosome-associated protein 25 kda (snap-25) are
the promising targets nsm protein virus infection.
