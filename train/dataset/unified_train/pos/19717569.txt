infection host cell retrovirus requires initial interaction a
cellular receptor. numerous gammaretroviruses, gibbon ape
leukemia virus, woolly monkey virus, feline leukemia virus subgroup b, feline
leukemia virus subgroup t, 10a1 murine leukemia virus, receptor the
human type iii sodium-dependent inorganic phosphate transporter, slc20a1,
formerly known pit1. understanding critical receptor functionalities and
interactions virus lead successful infection requires we
first know surface structure cellular receptor. previous molecular
modeling protein sequence, limited empirical data, predicted a
protein 10 transmembrane helices. undertake biochemical approach
of substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis resolve topology this
receptor live cells. discover segments protein that
are unexpectedly exposed outside milieu. using information determined
by substituted cysteine accessibility mutagenesis set constraints hmmtop, a
hidden markov model-based transmembrane topology prediction method, now
propose comprehensive topological model slc20a1, transmembrane protein
with 12 transmembrane helices 7 extracellular regions, varies from
previous models permit approaches define virus interaction
and transport function.
