hepatitis c virus (hcv) core pleiotropic effect various promoters. in
this study, found expression nucleolar phosphoprotein b23 was
enhanced hcv core-expressing cells and, moreover, hcv core interacts directly 
with c-terminal end b23. using sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis
and immunoprecipitation assays, hcv core found large complex containing 
b23 interacting partner transcription factor yy1. b23 hcv core
associated yy1 central ga/gk-rich c-terminal zinc finger domain. 
these physical interactions core, b23, yy1 led ternary complex
formation bound yy1 response element. transient
cotransfection experiment, relief trans-suppression activity yy1 the
yy1-response element-driven reporter core b23 found. also true
when examining effects three constructs b23 promoter-driven
reporter. additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated a
transcriptional activation complex consisting core, together b23, p300,
and yy1, recruited yy1 response element b23 promoter, this
probably occurred complex formation core three cellular
transcription regulators. different situation absence 
core, yy1 histone deacetylase 1, b23 p300, associated 
on yy1 element transcription repression complex. together, results
indicate hcv core recruit b23 p300 relieve repression effect 
of yy1 b23 promoter activity, property requires intrinsic histone
acetyltransferase activity p300. thus, three core-associated
cellular transcription regulators multitude cellular interacting
proteins involved versatility cellular processes, complex
formation described may partially account pleiotropic effects of
core protein gene expression cellular function hcv-infected cells.
