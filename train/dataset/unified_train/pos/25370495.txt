deep sequencing rnas produced zaire ebolavirus (ebov) angola strain 
of marburgvirus (marv-ang) identified novel viral cellular mechanisms that
diversify coding noncoding sequences viral mrnas genomic rnas. 
identified previously undescribed sites within ebov marv-ang mrnas 
apparent cotranscriptional editing resulted addition of
non-template-encoded residues within ebov glycoprotein (gp) mrna, the
marv-ang nucleoprotein (np) mrna, marv-ang polymerase (l) mrna, that
novel viral translation products could produced. further, found the
well-characterized ebov gp mrna editing site modified high frequency
during viral genome rna replication. additionally, editing hot spots representing
sites apparent adenosine deaminase activity found marv-ang np
3'-untranslated region. studies identify novel filovirus-host interactions 
and reveal production greater diversity filoviral gene products 
previously appreciated.importance: study identifies novel mechanisms that
alter protein coding capacities ebola marburg virus mrnas. therefore, 
filovirus gene expression complex diverse previously recognized.
these observations suggest new directions understanding regulation of
filovirus gene expression.
