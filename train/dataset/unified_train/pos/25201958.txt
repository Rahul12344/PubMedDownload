hepatitis b virus (hbv), causative agent chronic hepatitis b and
prototypic hepadnavirus, small dna virus replicates protein-primed
reverse transcription. product 3-kb relaxed circular dna (rc-dna) in
which one strand linked viral polymerase (p protein) a
tyrosyl-dna phosphodiester bond. upon infection, incoming rc-dna converted
into covalently closed circular (ccc) dna, serves viral persistence
reservoir refractory current anti-hbv treatments. mechanism of
cccdna formation unknown, release p protein one mandatory step. 
structural similarities rc-dna cellular topoisomerase-dna adducts and
their known repair tyrosyl-dna-phosphodiesterase (tdp) 1 tdp2 suggested
that hbv may usurp enzymes purpose. demonstrate that
human chicken tdp2, yeast ortholog tdp1, specifically
cleave tyr-dna bond virus-adapted model substrates release p protein
from authentic hbv duck hbv (dhbv) rc-dna vitro, without prior proteolysis
of large p proteins. consistent tpd2's physiological role in
cccdna formation, rnai-mediated tdp2 depletion human cells significantly
slowed conversion rc-dna cccdna. ectopic tdp2 expression same
cells restored faster conversion kinetics. data strongly suggest tdp2 
is first, although likely only, host dna-repair factor involved hbv 
cccdna biogenesis. addition establishing functional link between
hepadnaviruses dna repair, results open new prospects directly
targeting hbv persistence.
