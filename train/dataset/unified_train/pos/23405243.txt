genomic instability stemming dysregulation cell cycle checkpoints dna
damage response (ddr) common feature many cancers. cancer adult t
cell leukemia (atl) occur individuals infected human cell leukemia 
virus type 1 (htlv-1), atl cells contain extensive chromosomal abnormalities,
suggesting defects recognition repair dna damage.
since tax transforming protein encoded htlv-1, asked whether tax can
affect cell cycle checkpoints ddr. using combination flow cytometry 
and dna repair assays showed tax-expressing cells exit g(1) phase and
initiate dna replication prematurely following damage. reduced phosphorylation of
h2ax (γh2ax) rpa2, phosphoproteins essential properly initiate
the ddr, also observed tax-expressing cells. determine cause of
decreased ddr protein phosphorylation tax-expressing cells, examined the
cellular phosphatase, wip1, known dephosphorylate γh2ax. found
that tax interact wip1 vivo vitro, tax-expressing
cells display elevated levels wip1 mrna. vitro phosphatase assays showed
that tax enhance wip1 activity γh2ax peptide target 2-fold. thus,
loss γh2ax vivo could due, part, increased expression activity
of wip1 presence tax. sirna knockdown wip1 tax-expressing cells
rescued γh2ax response damage, confirming role wip1 ddr.
these studies demonstrate tax disengage g(1)/s checkpoint by
enhancing wip1 activity, resulting reduced ddr. premature g(1) exit of
tax-expressing cells presence dna lesions creates environment that
tolerates incorporation random mutations host genome.
