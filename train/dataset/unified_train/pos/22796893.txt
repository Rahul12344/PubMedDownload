background & aims: hepatitis c virus (hcv) requires host cellular proteins for
its propagation. identify cellular factors necessary hcv
propagation, recently screened small interfering rna (sirna) library 
targeting cell cycle genes using cell culture grown hcv (hcvcc)-infected cells.
in current study, selected characterized gene encoding cyclin
a2 (cyca2). deregulation cyca2 implicated many types cancers,
including hepatocellular carcinoma.
methods: effects cyca2 hcv propagation investigated by
sirna-mediated knockdown assay, vitro vivo protein binding assays,
luciferase reporter gene assay, immunoblot assay.
results: showed sirna-mediated depletion cyca2 significantly inhibited
hcv replication hcv subgenomic replicon cells hcvcc-infected cells.
furthermore, hcv non-structural 5b (ns5b) specifically interacted cyca2 in
vitro vivo. protein interaction mediated cyclin box of
cyca2 palm domain ns5b. showed r/hxl motif palm
domain hcv ns5b mediated protein interaction cyca2 interaction
was necessary hcv replication. moreover, demonstrated tylophorine,
the natural plant product exerting cyca2 inhibitory function, abrogated hcv
replication.
conclusions: hcv regulates cyca2 via ns5b protein propagation. in
addition, tylophorine may potential therapeutic agent hcv.
