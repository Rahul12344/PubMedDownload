in human papillomavirus dna replication, viral protein e2 forms homodimers
and binds 12-bp palindromic dna sequences surrounding origin dna
replication. via protein-protein interaction, recruits viral
helicase e1 a/t-rich origin replication, whereupon dihexamer forms,
resulting dna replication initiation. order carry dna replication,
the viral proteins must interact host factors currently all
known. attractive cellular candidate regulating viral replication is
topbp1, known interactor e2 protein. mammalian dna replication,
topbp1 loads dna polymerases onto replicative helicase g(1)-to-s
transition, process tightly cell cycle controlled. direct
interaction e2 topbp1 would allow e2 bypass cell cycle
control, resulting dna replication per cell cycle, a
requirement viral life cycle. report generation hpv16
e2 mutant compromised topbp1 interaction vivo demonstrate this
mutant retains transcriptional activation repression functions has
suboptimal dna replication potential. introduction mutant viral
life cycle model results failure establish viral episomes. results 
present potential new antiviral target, e2-topbp1 interaction, increase
our understanding viral life cycle, suggesting e2-topbp1
interaction essential.
