kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv)-infected cells express the
latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) involved regulation host 
viral gene expression maintenance kshv latent episome. performance 
these diverse functions involves 7-amino-acid chromatin-binding motif (cbm)
situated amino terminus lana capable binding directly to
nucleosomes. lana interacts additional chromatin components, including
methyl-cpg-binding protein 2 (mecp2). here, show carboxy-terminal
dna-binding/dimerization domain lana provides principal interaction with
mecp2 association modulated cbm. domains are
required lana colocalize mecp2 chromocenters, regions extensive
pericentric heterochromatin imaged fluorescence microscopy. within
mecp2, methyl-cpg-binding domain (mbd) primary determinant for
chromatin localization acts together adjacent repression domains
(the transcription repression domain [trd] corepressor-interacting domain
[crid]) redirect lana chromocenters. mecp2 facilitates repression lana
bound kshv terminal repeats, function requires mecp2 c terminus
in addition mbd crid/trd. lana mecp2 also cooperate to
stimulate transcription human e2f1 promoter, lacks lana
dna-binding sequence, function requires n c termini of
lana. ability lana establish multivalent interactions histones and
chromatin-binding proteins mecp2 would enable lana direct regulatory
complexes specific chromosomal sites thereby achieve stable reprogramming 
of cellular gene expression latently infected cells.
