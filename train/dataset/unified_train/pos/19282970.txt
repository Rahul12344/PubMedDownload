open reading frame (orf) 45 kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) 
a tegument protein. genetic analysis null mutant suggested possible
role protein events leading viral egress. study, orf45
was found interact kif3a, kinesin-2 motor protein transports
cargoes along microtubules cell periphery yeast two-hybrid screen. the
association confirmed co-immunoprecipitation immunoflorescence
approaches primary effusion lymphoma cells following virus reactivation. orf45
principally mediated docking entire viral capsid-tegument complexes onto
the cargo-binding domain kif3a. microtubules served major highways 
transportation complexes evidenced drastically reduced viral
titers upon treatment cells microtubule depolymerizer, nocodazole.
confocal microscopic images revealed close association viral particles
with microtubules. inhibition kif3a-orf45 interaction either use a
headless dominant negative (dn) mutant kif3a shrna-mediated
silencing endogenous kif3a expression noticeably decreased kshv egress
reflecting appreciable reductions release extracellular virions.
both approaches, however, failed impact hsv-1 egress, demonstrating 
specificity kif3a kshv transportation. study thus reports on
transportation kshv viral complexes microtubules kif3a, kinesin motor 
thus far implicated virus transportation. findings shed light on
the understudied significant events kshv life cycle, delineating a
crucial role kshv tegument protein cellular transport viral particles.
