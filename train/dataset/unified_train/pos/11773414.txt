g4 p13(ii) accessory proteins encoded x region bovine leukemia 
virus human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1), respectively. disruption
of g4 p13(ii) open reading frames interferes viral spread animal 
model systems, indicating corresponding proteins play key role in
viral replication. addition, g4 oncogenic primary cell cultures is
absolutely required efficient onset leukemogenesis sheep. gain
insight function proteins, utilized yeast two-hybrid
system identify protein partners g4. results revealed g4 interacts
with farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase (fpps), protein involved the
mevalonate/squalene pathway synthesis fpp, substrate required for
prenylation ras. specificity interaction verified by
glutathione s-transferase (gst) pull-down assays coimmunoprecipitation
experiments. furthermore, confocal microscopy showed subcellular
localization g4 profoundly affected fpps. g4 protein not
prenylated, least rabbit reticulocyte lysate-based assays. domain g4
required binding fpps restricted amphipathic alpha-helix rich in
arginine residues. subtle mutation alpha-helix abrogated g4 oncogenic
potential vitro, providing biological relevance fpps-g4 complex
formation cells. finally, htlv-1 p13(ii) also found specifically
interact fpps (in yeast well gst pull-down assays) to
colocalize g4 mitochondria, suggesting functional analogy these
oncoviral accessory proteins. identification fpps molecular partner for
p13(ii) g4 accessory proteins opens new prospects treatment of
retrovirus-induced leukemia.
