death domain-associated protein (daxx) cooperates x-linked α-thalassaemia
retardation syndrome protein (atrx), putative member sucrose
non-fermentable 2 family atp-dependent chromatin-remodelling proteins, acting 
as core atpase subunit complex, whereas daxx targeting factor,
leading histone deacetylase recruitment, h3.3 deposition transcriptional
repression cellular promoters. despite recent findings fundamental
importance chromatin modification host-cell gene regulation, remains
unclear whether adenovirus type 5 (ad5) transcription regulated cellular
chromatin remodelling allow efficient virus gene expression. here, focus on
the repressive role daxx/atrx complex ad5 replication, which
depends intact protein-protein interaction, negative regulation could be
relieved daxx mutant unable interact atrx. ensure
efficient viral replication, ad5 e1b-55k protein inhibits daxx targets atrx

studies illustrate importance diversity viral factors antagonizing
daxx/atrx-mediated repression viral gene expression shed new light 
modulation cellular chromatin remodelling factors ad5. show the
first time cellular daxx/atrx chromatin remodelling complexes play essential
roles ad gene expression illustrate importance early viral proteins
to counteract cellular chromatin remodelling.
