epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1), principal viral
oncoprotein member tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, 
constitutively active membrane signaling protein regulates multiple signal
transduction pathways via c-terminal-activating region 1 (ctar1) ctar2,
and also less-studied ctar3. protein sumoylation among other
posttranslational modifications may regulate many signaling pathways induced by
lmp1, investigated whether ebv latency lmp1 regulates sumoylation
processes control cellular activation cellular responses. by
immunoprecipitation experiments, show lmp1 interacts ubc9, the
single reported sumo-conjugating enzyme. requirements lmp1-ubc9 interactions 
include enzymatically active ubc9: expression inactive ubc9 (ubc9 c93s)
inhibited lmp1-ubc9 interaction. lmp1 ctar3, ctar1 ctar2,
participated lmp1-ubc9 interaction, amino acid sequences found in
ctar3, including jak-interacting motif, contributed interaction.
furthermore, lmp1 expression coincided increased sumoylation cellular
proteins, disruption ubc9-lmp1 ctar3 interaction almost completely
abrogated lmp1-induced protein sumoylation, suggesting interaction
promotes sumoylation downstream targets. additional consequences the
disruption lmp1 ctar3-ubc9 interaction revealed effects cellular
migration, hallmark oncogenesis. together, data demonstrate lmp1 
ctar3 fact function intracellular signaling leads biological
effects. propose lmp1, interaction ubc9, modulates sumoylation
processes, regulate signal transduction pathways affect phenotypic
changes associated oncogenesis.
