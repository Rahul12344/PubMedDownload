the resurrection endogenous retroviruses inactive molecular fossils has
allowed investigation interactions extinct pathogens their
hosts occurred millions years ago. two paleoviruses, chimpanzee
endogenous retrovirus-1 -2 (cerv1 cerv2), relatives modern mlvs
and found genomes variety old world primates, absent
from human genome. extant cerv1 -2 proviruses known encode
functional proteins. investigate host range restriction viruses, 
we attempted reconstruct functional envelopes generating consensus genes
and proteins. cerv1 -2 enveloped mlv particles infected cell lines a
range mammalian species. using cerv2 env-pseudotyped mlv reporters, we
identified copper transport protein 1 (ctr1) receptor presumably
used cerv2 ancient exogenous replication primates. expression of
human ctr1 sufficient confer cerv2 permissiveness otherwise resistant
hamster cells, ctr1 knockdown cucl(2) treatment specifically inhibited
cerv2 infection human cells. mutations highly conserved ctr1 residues 
have rendered hamster cells resistant cerv2 include unique deletion a
copper-binding motif. cerv2 receptor-inactivating mutations hamster ctr1
are accompanied apparently compensating changes, including increased number
of extracellular copper-coordinating residues, may represent an
evolutionary barrier acquisition cerv2 resistance primates.
