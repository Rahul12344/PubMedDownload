in vivo infection lymphatic tissues human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) leads enhanced apoptosis, prominently involves uninfected
bystander cells. increased killing bystander cells mediated part
through nef induction fas ligand (fasl) expression surface the
virally infected cells. subsequent interaction fasl fas (cd95)
displayed neighbouring cells, including hiv-1-specific cytotoxic t
lymphocytes, may lead bystander cell killing thus forms important
mechanism immune evasion. hiv-1 also enhances fas expression virally
infected cells, unclear hosts avoid rapid cell-autonomous
apoptosis mediated cis ligation fas fasl. show hiv-1
nef associates inhibits apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ask1), a
serine/threonine kinase forms common key signalling intermediate in
the fas tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (tnfalpha) death-signalling pathways.
the interaction nef ask1 inhibits fas- tnfalpha-mediated
apoptosis, well activation downstream c-jun amino-terminal
kinase. findings reveal strategy hiv-1 nef promotes killing of
bystander cells induction fasl, simultaneously protecting
the hiv-1-infected host cell pro-apoptotic signals its
