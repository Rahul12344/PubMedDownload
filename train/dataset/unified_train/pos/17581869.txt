this study demonstrates power genetic selection identify variant
virus uses new retroviral receptor protein. screened random peptide
library within receptor-binding domain feline leukemia virus retroviral 
envelope (felv env) protein productive infection feline ah927 cells. one
variant, a5, obtained altered tropic properties acquired ability use 
the solute carrier protein family 35 member f2 (slc35f2) receptor. the
slc35f2 protein presumed transporter unknown function predicted encode
8 10 transmembrane-spanning regions homologous identified
retroviral receptor. expression feline slc35f2 cdna nonpermissive cells
renders cells susceptible infection a5 virus, remarkably high
titers range 10(5) infectious units per ml. human slc35f2 orf also 
functioned retroviral receptor, albeit lower efficiency feline
homologue. successful selection novel molecule, slc35f2
transporter/channel-type protein, receptor felv env backbone suggests
that multipass transmembrane proteins may particularly suited use in
productive viral entry fusion. analysis retroviral env libraries
randomized receptor-binding domain offers viable means develop viral 
vectors targeted specific cell types absence known targeting
ligands.
