we determined distinct roles different proteasome complexes in
adenovirus (ad) e1a-dependent transcription. show 19s atpase, s8, 
a component 19s atpase proteins independent 20s (apis), binds specifically 
to e1a transactivation domain, conserved region 3 (cr3). recruitment apis 
to cr3 enhances ability e1a stimulate transcription viral early
gene promoters ad infection human cells. ability cr3 to
stimulate transcription yeast similarly dependent functional
integrity yeast apis components, sug1 sug2. 20s proteasome also
recruited cr3 independently apis 26s proteasome. chromatin
immunoprecipitation reveals e1a, s8 20s proteasome recruited 
both ad early region gene promoters early region gene sequences ad
infection, suggesting requirement transcriptional initiation and
elongation. also demonstrate e1a cr3 transactivation degradation
sequences functionally overlap proteasome inhibitors repress e1a
transcription. taken together, data demonstrate distinct roles apis and
the 20s proteasome e1a-dependent transactivation.
