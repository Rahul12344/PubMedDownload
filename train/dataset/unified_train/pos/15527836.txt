ecotropic murine leukemia viruses (mlvs) recognize third extracellular loop
of receptor, cationic amino acid transporter type 1 (cat1). cat1 protein 
contains two conserved n-linked glycosylation sites third extracellular
loops mouse, rat, hamster receptors (mcat1, rcat1, hcat1,
respectively). glycosylation rcat1 hcat1 receptors inhibits ecotropic 
mlv infection cat1-expressing cells, mcat1 afford the
cells protection. compared mcat1 protein, rcat1 hcat1
proteins possess three six amino acid insertions, respectively, third 
extracellular loop. determine whether inserted amino acids are
associated ecotropic mlv infection inhibition glycosylation, several
mutants mcat1 rcat1 receptors constructed. mutants
generated present study, rcat1 mutant 1 exhibited detectable protein 
expression levels. rcat1 mutant 1-expressing human np2 cells more
susceptible transduction ecotropic mlv vectors wild-type
rcat1-expressing cells. tunicamycin, n-glycosylation inhibitor, increased
transduction titer wild-type rcat1-expressing cells, 
the cells expressing either mcat1 rcat1 mutation 1. amino acid
substitution glycosylation site wild-type rcat1 conferred higher
infection susceptibility, rcat1 mutant 1 not. the
wild-type mcat1 rcat1 proteins, rcat1 mutants detected cell
surface immunofluorescence microscopy. tunicamycin treatment affect
cellular distribution rcat1 mutant 1, wild-type mcat1 rcat1 proteins.
these results indicate extra amino acids rcat1 (as compared to
the mcat1) associated inhibition ecotropic mlv infection rcat1
glycosylation.
