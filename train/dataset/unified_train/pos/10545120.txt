dna replication epstein-barr virus (ebv) productive phase the
life cycle herpesvirus depends cis-acting element orilyt. it
consists two essential domains, upstream downstream component.
whereas upstream component contains several dna-binding motifs viral 
activator protein bzlf1, downstream component known binding site
of several cellular proteins. identified cellular transcription factors that
bind synergistically functionally relevant subsequence downstream
component, td element. two transcription factors, zbp-89 sp1,
stimulate replication shown protein fusions gal4 dna-binding
domain single gal4 dna-binding motif inserted td element. in
protein binding assays, observed interaction sp1 zbp-89 the
viral dna polymerase processivity factor. data indicate cellular
transcriptional activators tether viral replication proteins lytic origin 
via direct protein-protein interactions assemble viral replication complex
at orilyt.
