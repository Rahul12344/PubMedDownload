unfolded protein response (upr) cellular adaptive response functions
to reduce stress caused misfolded proteins endoplasmic reticulum (er). 
we others previously shown infection hepatitis c virus (hcv)
or expression viral proteins trigger upr. hcv single-stranded
positive-sense rna virus causing chronic diseases humans. genome encodes
two envelope proteins e1 e2 mature er form non-covalently
bound native complex disulphide-bonded aggregates. apart er
targeting proteins, cytosolic forms documented. previously
shown er-targeting e1 e2 capable eliciting upr whereas
others shown cytosolic-targeting e2 bind er stress
kinase perk dampen upr. report, show other
envelope protein e1, cytosolic form, also bind perk dampen the
upr. using gst-pulldown assay, show e1 binds cytoplasmic domain of
perk, suggesting interaction e1 perk takes place cytoplasm. using
reporter gene assay western blotting, show cytosolic e1 repress
upr-induced bip chop promoter activity reduce upr-induced chop expression
level. altogether results suggest opposing functions er- cytosolic
forms hcv envelope proteins depending subcellular localization.
