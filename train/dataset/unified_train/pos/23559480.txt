human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) major cause severe lower
respiratory tract infection. infection critically dependent rsv fusion 
(f) protein, mediates fusion viral envelope airway
epithelial cells. f protein also expressed infected cells is
responsible fusion infected cells adjacent cells, resulting the
formation multinucleate syncytia. receptor advanced glycation end
products (rage) pattern-recognition receptor constitutively highly
expressed type alveolar epithelial cells. here, report rage
protected hek cells rsv-induced cell death reduced viral titres in
vitro. rage appeared interact directly f protein, but, rather than
inhibiting rsv entry host cells, virus replication budding,
membrane-expressed rage soluble rage blocked f-protein-mediated syncytium
formation sloughing. data indicate rage may contribute to
protecting lower airways rsv inhibiting formation syncytia,
viral spread, epithelial damage airway obstruction.
