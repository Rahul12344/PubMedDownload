the involvement tax oncoprotein ink4-cdk4/6-rb pathway been
regarded key factor immortalization transformation human t-cell
leukemia virus 1 (htlv-1) infected cells. p16 -/- +/+ cells,
expression tax correlated increase cdk4 activity, which
subsequently increases phosphorylation rb drives infected cells
into cell cycle progression. relation effects, tax shown 
interact two components ink4-cdk4/6-rb pathway, p16 cyclin d(s). 
while tax competes cdk4 p16 binding, thus suppressing p16 inhibition 
cdk4, tax also binds cyclin d(s) concomitant increases cdk4
activity phosphorylation cyclin d(s). show tax and
residues 1-40 n-terminus tax, tax40n, bind activate cdk4 in
vitro. presence ink4 proteins, binding tax tax40n cdk4
counteracts inhibition p16 p18 acts major path to
regulate tax-mediated activation cdk4. also report tax40n retains 
transactivation ability. results vitro studies demonstrate a
potentially novel, p16-independent route regulate cdk4 activity tax
oncoprotein htlv-1 infected cells.
