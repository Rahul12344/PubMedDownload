human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) exploits number host cellular factors
for successful survival propagation. viral protein nef plays important
role hiv-1 pathogenesis interacting various cellular proteins. 
present work, identified cyclin k (cyck) novel nef-interacting protein,
and first time, showed cyck inhibits hiv-1 gene expression and
replication nef-dependent manner. positive elongation factor b complex
comprising cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9) cyclin t1 critical cellular 
complex required viral gene expression replication. enhanced expression
of cyck presence nef induced cyck-cdk9 binding, prevented
cdk9-cyclin t1 complex formation nuclear translocation cdk9, resulting 
inhibition hiv-1 long terminal repeat-driven gene expression. furthermore,
this effect cyck observed nef-deleted virus, indicating the
importance nef phenomenon. finally, silencing cyck in
hiv-1-infected cells resulted increased translocation cdk9 the
nucleus, leading increased viral gene expression replication. data
also suggest endogenous cyck might act inhibitory factor hiv-1
gene expression replication t-cells. thus, results clearly demonstrate
that cyck utilizes hiv-1 nef protein displace cyct1 positive
elongation factor b complex, resulting inhibition hiv-1 gene expression and
replication.
