hepatitis c virus (hcv) protein translation mediated cis-acting rna, an
internal ribosomal entry site (ires), located 5' nontranslated region of
the viral rna. examine proteins bound ires, could include
proteins important function well potential drug targets, used
shotgun peptide sequencing identify proteins quadruplicate protein affinity
extracts lysed huh7 cells, obtained using biotinylated ires. twenty-six
proteins bound hcv ires reversed complementary sequence rna or
vector rna controls. included five ribosomal subunits, nine eukaryotic
initiation factor 3 subunits, novel interacting proteins the
cytoskeletal-related proteins actin, fhos (formin homologue overexpressed in
spleen) mip-t3 (microtubule interacting protein associates traf3). 
other novel hcv ires-binding proteins included unr (upstream n-ras),
unr-interacting protein, rna-binding proteins pai-1 (plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1) mrna binding protein ewing sarcoma breakpoint 1 region
protein ews. large set additional proteins bound hcv ires a
reversed complementary ires sequence control, including known hcv interactors
ptb (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), la autoantigen, nucleolin.
the discovery novel hcv ires-binding proteins suggests links between
ires biology cytoskeleton, signal transduction, cellular
functions.
