although inbred mouse strains highly susceptible mouse hepatitis
virus (mhv) infection, inbred sjl line mice highly resistant its
infection. principal receptor mhv murine ceacam1 (mceacam1).
susceptible strains mice homozygous 1a allele mceacam1, while
sjl mice homozygous 1b allele. mceacam1a (1a) 10- to
100-fold-higher receptor activity mceacam1b (1b). explore the
hypothesis mhv susceptibility due different mhv receptor
activities 1a 1b, established chimeric c57bl/6 mouse (cb61ba) in
which part n-terminal immunoglobulin (ig)-like domain mceacam1a
(1a) gene, responsible mhv receptor function, replaced the
corresponding region mceacam1b (1b). compared mhv susceptibility of
these chimeric mice sjl b6 mice. b6 mice homozygous for
1a highly susceptible mhv-a59 infection, 50% lethal dose (ld(50))
of 10(2.5) pfu, chimeric cb61ba mice sjl mice homozygous 1ba and
1b, respectively, survived following inoculation 10(5) pfu. unexpectedly,
cb61ba mice resistant mhv-a59 infection sjl mice measured by
virus replication target organs, including liver brain. infectious
virus viral rna detected organs cb61ba mice, viral rna and
infectious virus detected target organs sjl mice. furthermore, sjl
mice produced antiviral antibodies mhv-a59 inoculation 10(5) pfu, 
cb61ba mice not. thus, cb61ba mice apparently completely resistant to
mhv-a59 infection, sjl mice permit low levels mhv-a59 virus replication 
during self-limited, asymptomatic infection. expressed cultured bhk
cells, mceacam1b mceacam1ba proteins similar levels mhv-a59
receptor activity. results strongly support hypothesis although
alleles mceacam1 principal determinants mouse susceptibility to
mhv-a59, as-yet-unidentified murine genes may also play role in
susceptibility mhv.
