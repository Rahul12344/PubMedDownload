hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein (core) plays significant role the
development chronic liver diseases caused hcv infection. discovered
that core sensitized all-trans-retinoic acid (atra)-induced cell death in
mcf-7 cells. activation retinoic acid receptor alpha (raralpha)-mediated
transcription core also seen cell lines tested. use a
yeast two-hybrid system, identified sp110b candidate a
core-interacting cellular factor. although function sp110b remained
unknown, observed sp110b interacts raralpha suppresses
raralpha-mediated transcription. data suggest sp110b a
transcriptional cofactor negatively regulating raralpha-mediated transcription.
rna interference-mediated reduction endogenous sp110b levels depressed the
ability core activate raralpha-mediated transcription, suggesting an
essential role sp110b pathway. normal nuclear subcellular
localization sp110b altered molecular interaction core 
cytoplasmic surface endoplasmic reticulum. evidence suggests model 
in core sequesters sp110b nucleus inactivates its
corepressor function activate raralpha-mediated transcription. findings 
likely describe novel system cytoplasmic viral protein regulates
host cell transcription.
