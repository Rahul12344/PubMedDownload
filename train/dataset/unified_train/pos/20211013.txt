myxoma virus (myxv), member poxviridae family, agent responsible 
for myxomatosis, fatal disease european rabbit (oryctolagus cuniculus). 
like poxviruses, myxv known encoding multiple proteins regulate
cellular signaling pathways. among them, four proteins share ank/pranc
structure: m148r, m149r, mnf (myxoma nuclear factor) m-t5, them
described virulence factors. family poxvirus proteins, recently
identified, drawn considerable attention potential role modulating
the host ubiquitin-proteasome system viral infection. date, many
members novel protein family shown interact scf
components, vitro. here, focus mnf gene, shown express
a nuclear protein presenting nine ank repeats, one identified
as nuclear localization signal. transfection, mnf shown to
colocalise transcription factor nf-kappab nucleus of
tnfalpha-stimulated cells. functionally, mnf critical virulence factor since
its deletion generates almost apathogenic virus. study, pursue 
investigation proteins interacting mnf mechanism action, we
engineered recombinant myxv expressing gfp-linked mnf control of
mnf native promoter. infection rabbits myxv-gfpmnf recombinant virus
provided evidence gfp fusion disturb main function of
mnf. hence, cells infected myxv-gfpmnf immunoprecipitation the
gfpmnf fusion protein performed identify mnf's partners. first
time, endogenous components scf (cullin-1 skp1) co-precipitated 
an ank myxoma virus protein, expressed infectious context, without
over-expression protein.
