we used yeast interaction trap system identify novel human 70-kda
protein, termed ns1-binding protein (ns1-bp), interacts the
nonstructural ns1 protein influenza virus. genetic interaction was
confirmed specific coprecipitation ns1 protein solution a
glutathione s-transferase-ns1-bp fusion protein glutathione-sepharose. ns1-bp
contains n-terminal btb/poz domain five kelch-like tandem repeat elements 
of approximately 50 amino acids. noninfected cells, affinity-purified
antibodies localized ns1-bp nuclear regions enriched spliceosome
assembly factor sc35, suggesting association ns1-bp cellular
splicing apparatus. influenza virus-infected cells, ns1-bp relocalized
throughout nucleoplasm appeared distinct sc35 domains, which
suggests ns1-bp function may disturbed altered. addition a
truncated ns1-bp mutant protein hela cell nuclear extract efficiently
inhibited pre-mrna splicing spliceosome assembly. result could be
explained possible dominant-negative effect ns1-bp mutant protein and
suggests role wild-type ns1-bp promoting pre-mrna splicing. these
data suggest inhibition splicing ns1 protein may mediated
by binding ns1-bp.
