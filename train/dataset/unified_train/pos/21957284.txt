human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gag main structural protein
driving assembly release virions infected cells. gag alone capable
of self-assembly vitro, host factors shown play role in
efficient viral replication particle morphogenesis within living cell. in
a series affinity purification experiments, identified cellular protein
lyric hiv-1 gag-interacting protein. lyric previously described to
be hiv-inducible gene involved various signaling pathways. gag
interacts endogenous lyric via matrix (ma) nucleocapsid (nc)
domains. interaction requires gag multimerization lyric amino acids 101 
to 289. endogenous lyric incorporated hiv-1 virions cleaved the
viral protease. gag-lyric interaction also observed murine leukemia virus
and equine infectious anemia virus, suggesting represents conserved
feature among retroviruses. expression gag binding domain lyric
increased gag expression levels viral infectivity, whereas expression a
lyric mutant lacking gag binding site resulted lower gag expression and
decreased viral infectivity. results current study identify lyric to
be cellular interaction partner hiv-1 gag hint potential role in
regulating infectivity. experiments needed elucidate precise
role interaction.
