expression human lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i)
transactivator/oncoprotein, tax, leads faulty mitosis reflected by
chromosome aneuploidy, cytokinesis failure, formation micro- and
multinucleated cells. show htlv-i-transformed cells progress
through s/g(2)/m phases cell cycle delay. delay correlated 
with decrease levels cyclin a, cyclin b1, securin. in
tax-expressing cells, cdc20-associated anaphase promoting complex
(apc(cdc20)), e3 ubiquitin ligase controls metaphase anaphase
transition, becomes active cellular entry mitosis evidenced by
premature cyclin b1 polyubiquitination degradation s/g(2). consistent 
with notion tax activates apc(cdc20) directly, tax found to
coimmunoprecipitate cdc20 cdc27/apc3. apc(cdc20) activity
prematurely activated tax remains sensitive spindle checkpoint inhibition. 
unscheduled activation apc(cdc20) tax provides explanation the
mitotic abnormalities htlv-i-infected cells likely play important
role development adult cell leukemia.
