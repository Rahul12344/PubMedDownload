poxviruses encode proteins suppress host immune responses, including
secreted decoy receptors pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1
(il-1) vaccinia virus proteins a46r a52r inhibit intracellular
signaling members il-1 receptor (il-1r) toll-like receptor (tlr)
family. vivo, tlrs mediate innate immune response serving as
pathogen recognition receptors, whose oligomerized intracellular toll/il-1
receptor (tir) domains initiate innate immune signaling. family tir
domain-containing adapter molecules transduces signals engaged receptors
that ultimately activate nf-kappab and/or interferon regulatory factor 3 (irf3)
to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. data base searches detected significant
similarity n1l protein vaccinia virus a52r, poxvirus
inhibitor tir signaling. compared poxvirus virulence factors, the
poxvirus n1l protein strongly affects virulence vivo; however, precise
target n1l previously unknown. show n1l suppresses nf-kappab 
activation following engagement toll/il-1 receptors, tumor necrosis factor
receptors, lymphotoxin receptors. n1l inhibited receptor-, adapter-, traf-,
and ikk-alpha ikk-beta-dependent signaling nf-kappab. n1l associated 
several components multisubunit i-kappab kinase complex, strongly
associating kinase, tank-binding kinase 1 (tbk1). together these
findings consistent hypothesis n1l disrupts signaling to
nf-kappab toll/il-1rs tnf superfamily receptors targeting ikk
complex inhibition. furthermore, n1l inhibited irf3 signaling, also 
regulated tbk1. studies define role n1l immunomodulator of
innate immunity targeting components nf-kappab irf3 signaling pathways.
