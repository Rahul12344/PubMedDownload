protein kinase pkr (also known eif2ak2) activated viral infection
and phosphorylates alpha subunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor 
2 (eif2), leading inhibition translation viral replication. report
fast evolution pkr kinase domain vertebrates, coupled positive
selection specific sites. substitution positively selected residues in
human pkr residues found related species altered sensitivity pkr
inhibitors different poxviruses. species-specific differences sensitivity
to poxviral pseudosubstrate inhibitors identified human mouse
pkr, differences traced positively selected residues near the
eif2alpha binding site. findings indicate antiviral protein evolved to
evade viral inhibition maintaining primary function. moreover, the
identified species-specific differences susceptibility viral inhibitors
have important implications studying human infections nonhuman model
systems.
