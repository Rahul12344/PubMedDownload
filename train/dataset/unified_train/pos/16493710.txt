we developed surface plasmon resonance (spr)-based protein microarray to
study protein-protein interactions high-throughput mode. model system, 
triple protein interactions explored human papillomaviral e6
protein, tumor suppressor p53, ubiquitin ligase e6ap. human papillomavirus
(hpv) known causative agent cervical cancer. upon infection, the
viral e6 protein forms heterotrimeric protein complex p53 e6ap. the
formation complex eventually results degradation p53. the
present study, gst-fused e6ap protein layered onto glutathione
(gsh)-modified gold chip surface. specific binding gst-e6ap protein onto
the gold chip surface facilitated affinity gst specific
ligand gsh. interacting proteins (e6 and/or p53) spotted. detection
of interaction performed using spr imaging (spri) technique. the
resulting spri intensity data showed protein-protein interactions of
e6ap, e6, p53 detected concentration-dependent manner, suggesting
that spri-based microarray system effective tool study
protein-protein interactions multiple proteins involved.
