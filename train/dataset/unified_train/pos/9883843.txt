understanding primary steps viral entry important implications
for strategies prevent infection known viral pathogens well as
determining parameters efficient gene delivery using viral vectors. recently,
a two-step process viral infection involving attachment virus primary
receptor (coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor heparan sulfate proteoglycan)
and subsequent mediation virus entry co-receptor (alphav integrins and
hvem) determined adenovirus hsv, respectively. heparan
sulfate proteoglycan serves primary attachment receptor adeno-associated
virus type 2 (aav-2)(ref. 5). determined alphavbeta5 integrin plays 
a part efficient aav infection. experiments using chelating agent edta 
disrupt integrin function resulted corresponding decrease aav infection, 
consistent possibility integrin mediates infection. viral overlay
experiments purified plasma membrane proteins well immunoprecipitated
integrin beta5 subunit demonstrated aav directly associates beta5
subunit alphavbeta5 integrin. genetically defined cells expressing alphavbeta5
integrin showed increased susceptibility aav infection, demonstrating a
biological role integrin aav infection. finally, viral binding and
internalization studies indicate alphavbeta5 integrin primary
attachment receptor aav-2, instead involved facilitating virus
internalization. study supports idea alphavbeta5 integrin serves as
a co-receptor aav-2 virions, substantial effect use 
of aav vectors human gene therapy.
