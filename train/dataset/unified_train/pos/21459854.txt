human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) infection leads changes cellular
gene expression, turn tend modulate viral gene expression and
replication. cellular heat shock proteins (hsps) induced upon heat shock, uv 
irradiation microbial viral infections. reported earlier
nef-dependent induction hsp40 leading increased hiv-1 gene expression;
however, mechanism induction remained elucidated. expression of
hsps regulated heat shock factors (hsfs), studied role of
hsf1 nef-dependent hsp40 induction also hiv-1 gene expression.
our results show hsf1 also induced hiv-1 infection it
positively regulates hiv-1 gene expression two distinct pathways. first, along
with nef activates hsp40 promoter turn leads increased hiv-1 gene 
expression. second, hsf1 directly interacts newly identified hsf1 binding
sequence hiv-1 ltr promoter induces viral gene expression replication.
thus, present work identifies molecular basis hsf1-mediated
enhancement viral replication also provides another example hiv-1
uses host cell machinery successful replication host.
