poxviruses large double-stranded dna viruses replicate exclusively in
the cytoplasm infected cells within discrete compartments termed viral
factories. recent work shown prototypical poxvirus, vaccinia virus
(vacv) sequesters components eukaryotic translation initiation complex
eif4f within viral factories also stimulating formation eif4f complexes.
however, forces govern events remain unknown. here, show that
maximal eif4f formation requires viral dna replication formation viral
factories, suggesting sequestration functions promote eif4f assembly, and
identify ssdna-binding protein, i3 viral factor interacts and
co-localizes eif4f scaffold protein, eif4g. although not
adversely affect host viral protein synthesis, i3 specifically mediated the
binding eif4g ssdna. combined, findings offer explanation the
specific pattern temporal process eif4g redistribution eif4f complex
assembly within vacv-infected cells.
