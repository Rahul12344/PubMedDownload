the complement system, virtue dual effector priming functions, a
major host defense pathogens. flavivirus nonstructural protein (ns)-1 has
been speculated immune evasion activity, secreted
glycoprotein, binds back cell surfaces, accumulates high levels 
serum infected patients. herein, demonstrate immunomodulatory function
of west nile virus ns1. soluble cell-surface-associated ns1 binds and
recruits complement regulatory protein factor h, resulting decreased
complement activation solution attenuated deposition c3 fragments and
c5b-9 membrane attack complexes cell surfaces. accordingly, extracellular ns1 
may function minimize immune system targeting west nile virus decreasing
complement recognition infected cells.
