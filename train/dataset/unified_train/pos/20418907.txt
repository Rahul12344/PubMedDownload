kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) member gammaherpesvirus 
family. etiological agent three different human cancers, kaposi
sarcoma (ks), primary effusion lymphoma (pel) multicentric castleman disease.
the far left end kshv genome encodes unique transmembrane glycoprotein
called k1. k1 possesses ability transform rodent fibroblasts block
apoptosis. k1 also shown activate pi3k/akt/mtor pathway in
different cells. using tandem affinity purification, identified heat shock
protein 90beta (hsp90beta) endoplasmic reticulum-associated hsp40
(erdj3/dnajb11), cellular binding partners k1. interactions k1 with
hsp90beta hsp40 confirmed co-immunoprecipitation directions. 
furthermore, k1 also interacted hsp90alpha isoform. report that
small-interfering rnas directed hsp90 hsp40/erdj3, well as
pharmacological inhibitors hsp90, dramatically reduced k1 expression,
suggesting k1 client protein chaperones. addition, both
hsp90 hsp40/erdj3 essential k1's anti-apoptotic function. finally,
we report hsp90 inhibitors, 17-aag 17-dmag, suppress the
proliferation kshv-positive pel cell lines exhibited ic(50) values 50
nm below.
