ku implicated nuclear processes, including dna break repair,
transcription, v(d)j recombination, telomere maintenance. mode action 
involves two distinct mechanisms: one nonspecific binding occurs to
dna ends second involves specific binding negative regulatory
elements involved transcription repression. elements identified in
mouse mammary tumor virus human cell leukemia virus retroviruses. the
purpose study investigate role ku regulation human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-1 transcription. first, hiv-1 ltr activity was
studied cho-k1 cells ch0-derived xrs-6 cells, devoid ku80.
ltr-driven expression reporter gene significantly increased xrs-6
cells. enhancement suppressed re-expression ku80. second,
transcription hiv-1 followed u1 human cells depleted ku by
using ku80 antisense rna. ku depletion led increase hiv-1 mrna
synthesis viral production compared parent cells. results
demonstrate ku acts transcriptional repressor hiv-1 expression.
finally, putative ku-specific binding site identified within negative
regulatory region hiv-1 long terminal repeat, may account this
repression transcription.
