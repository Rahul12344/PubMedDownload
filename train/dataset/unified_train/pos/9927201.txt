adenovirus early region 1a (ad e1a) multifunctional protein is
essential adenovirus-mediated transformation oncogenesis. whilst e1a is
generally considered exert influence recipient cells regulation
of transcription also increases level cellular p53 increasing the
protein half-life. view, investigated relationship ad
e1a proteasome, normally responsible degradation p53. here
we shown ad5 ad12 e1a 12s 13s proteins be
co-immunoprecipitated proteasomes larger ad12 e1a protein binds
strongly least three components 26s 20s proteasome. one of
these interacting species identified mammalian sugi, proteasome
regulatory component also plays role cell mediator of
transcription. vitro assays demonstrated direct interaction between
ad12 e1a 13s protein mouse sugi. following infection human cells ad5 
wt ad5 mutants lesions e1a gene shown human sug1
can co-immunoprecipitated full-length e1a e1a carrying a
deletion conserved region 1 region considered responsible
for increased expression p53. concluded therefore ad eia binds
strongly sugi interaction responsible inhibition of
proteasome activity. consistent observation purified ad12
e1a inhibits activity purified 20s 26s proteasomes. have
also demonstrated sugi co-immunoprecipitated sv40 and
therefore suggest may represent common interaction transforming
proteins dna tumour viruses.
