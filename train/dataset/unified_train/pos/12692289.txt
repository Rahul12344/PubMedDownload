feline calicivirus (fcv) responsible acute upper respiratory tract
disease cats. fcv capsid protein synthesized precursor (76 kda)
that post-translationally processed mature 62 kda capsid protein by
removal n-terminal 124 amino acids. previous studies also
detected 40 kda protein, related fcv capsid protein, produced during
infection. demonstrate cleavage fcv capsid protein, during
infection cells culture, prevented caspase inhibitors. addition, 
caspase-2, -3 -7 activated fcv infection, shown pro-form
processing, increase in
n-acetyl-asp-glu-val-asp-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage activity 
in situ poly(adp-ribose) polymerase cleavage. caspase activation coincided with
the induction apoptosis capsid cleavage 40 kda fragment. in
vitro cleavage assay, using recombinant human caspases vitro-derived fcv
capsid protein, revealed caspase-2, lesser extent caspase-6,
cleaved capsid protein generate 40 kda fragment. taken together, these
results suggest fcv triggers apoptosis within infected cells that
caspase-induced capsid cleavage occurs concomitantly apoptosis. possible
role capsid cleavage pathogenesis fcv infection discussed.
