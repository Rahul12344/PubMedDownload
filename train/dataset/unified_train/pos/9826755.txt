we demonstrated human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (edn, rnase 2),
a rapidly evolving secretory protein derived eosinophilic leukocytes,
mediates ribonucleolytic destruction extracellular virions the
single-stranded rna virus respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). rnase activity
is crucial antiviral activity, clearly sufficient, results
suggest edn unique structural features apart rnase activity that
are necessary promote antiviral activity. demonstrate the
interaction edn extracellular virions rsv saturatable 
specific. increasing concentrations antivirally inactivated,
ribonucleolytically inactivated point mutant form recombinant human edn,
rhedndk38, inhibits rhedn's antiviral activity, increasing concentrations
of related rnase, recombinant human rnase k6, effect whatsoever.
interestingly, acquisition antiviral activity parallels evolutionary
development primate edn lineage, emerged time the
divergence old world new world monkeys. using information,
we created ribonucleolytically active chimeras human new world monkey
orthologs edn and, evaluating antiviral activity, identified 
an n-terminal segment human edn contains one sequence
elements mediate specific interaction rsv.
