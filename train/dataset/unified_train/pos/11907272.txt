fbi-1 cellular poz-domain-containing protein binds hiv-1 ltr and
associates hiv-1 transactivator protein tat. show elevated 
levels fbi-1 specifically stimulate tat activity effect is
dependent domain fbi-1 mediates tat-fbi-1 association in
vivo. fbi-1 also partially colocalizes tat tat's cellular cofactor,
p-tefb (cdk9 cyclin t1), splicing-factor-rich nuclear speckle domain. 
further, less-soluble population fbi-1 distributes novel
peripheral-speckle pattern localization well nuclear regions.
this distribution pattern dependent fbi-1 dna binding domain, the
presence cellular dna, active transcription. taken together, these
results suggest fbi-1 cellular factor preferentially associates
with active chromatin specifically stimulate tat-activated hiv-1
transcription.
