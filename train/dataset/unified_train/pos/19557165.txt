ebola zaire virus highly pathogenic humans, case fatality rates
approaching 90% large outbreaks africa. virus replicates macrophages
and dendritic cells (dcs), suppressing production type interferons (ifns)
while inducing release large quantities proinflammatory cytokines.
although viral vp35 protein shown inhibit ifn responses, the
mechanism blocks ifn production fully elucidated. we
expressed vp35 mouse-adapted variant ebola zaire virus murine dcs by
retroviral gene transfer, tested ifn transcription upon newcastle disease
virus (ndv) infection toll-like receptor signaling. found vp35
inhibited ifn transcription dcs following stimuli disabling the
activity irf7, transcription factor required ifn transcription. yeast
two-hybrid screens coimmunoprecipitation assays, found vp35
interacted irf7, ubc9 pias1. latter two host sumo e2 enzyme 
and e3 ligase, respectively. vp35, sumo ligase, increased
pias1-mediated sumoylation irf7, repressed ifn transcription. contrast,
vp35 interfere activation nf-kappab, required for
induction many proinflammatory cytokines. findings indicate ebola
zaire virus exploits cellular sumoylation machinery advantage and
help explain virus overcomes host innate defenses, causing rapidly
overwhelming infection produce syndrome resembling fulminant septic shock.
