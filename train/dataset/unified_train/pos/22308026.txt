hiv-1 integration promoted viral integrase (in) cellular cofactors.
the lens epithelium-derived growth factor (ledgf/p75), interacting cellular
cofactor, shown play important role hiv-1 chromatin targeting
and integration. however, whether cellular cofactors also involved in
viral replication steps still elusive. here, show nucleoporin 62
(nup62) chromatin-bound protein specifically interact hiv-1 
in soluble nuclear extract chromatin-bound fractions. knockdown of
nup62 shrna reduced association host chromatin and
significantly impaired viral integration replication hiv-1-susceptible
cells. furthermore, expression in-binding region nup62 cd4(+) 
cells significantly inhibited hiv-1 infection. taken together, results
indicate cellular nup62 specifically recruited hiv-1 and
contribute efficient viral dna integration.
