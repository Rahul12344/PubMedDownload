arginine methylation shown regulate signal transduction, protein
subcellular localization, gene transcription, protein-protein interactions
that ultimately alter gene expression. although role cellular protein
arginine methyltransferases (prmt) viral gene expression largely unknown,
we recently showed tat protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) substrate one enzyme, termed prmt6. however, mechanism 
by arginine methylation impairs transactivation potential tat and
the sites arginine methylation within tat remain obscure. show tat
is specific vitro vivo substrate prmt6 targets tat r52
and r53 residues arginine methylation. tat methylation led decreased 
interaction tat transactivation region (tar) viral rna. furthermore, 
arginine methylation tat negatively affected tat-tar-cyclin t1 ternary complex
formation diminished cyclin t1-dependent tat transcriptional activation.
overexpression wild-type prmt6, methylase-inactive prmt6 mutant,
reduced levels tat transactivation hiv-1 long terminal repeat
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase luciferase reporter plasmids a
dose-dependent manner. cell-based assays, knockdown prmt6 resulted in
increased hiv-1 production faster viral replication. thus, prmt6 can
compromise tat transcriptional activation may represent form innate
cellular immunity regard hiv-1 replication. finding way inhibiting 
stimulating prmt6 activity might help drive quiescently infected cells 
latency combat hiv-1 replication, respectively.
