the tr4 orphan receptor member nuclear receptor superfamily that
modulates gene expression via binding aggtca direct repeat hormone
response element. report functional study tr4 interaction the
core promoter hepatitis b virus (hbv). electrophoretic mobility shift 
assay shows tr4 bind direct repeat 1 sequence element
(aggttaaaggtct, nucleotide coordinates 1757-1769, tr4re-hbv) hbv core
promoter. tr4 also enhance activity synthetic luciferase reporter
linked four copies tr4re-hbv either liver hepg2 non-liver h1299
cells dose-dependent manner. surprisingly, tr4 represses activity a
luciferase reporter containing entire hbv genome sequences. moreover,
mutation tr4re-hbv site hbv core promoter diminishes tr4
suppression effect. tr4-induced suppression hbv core promoter activity is
further confirmed primer extension analysis hbv core rnas, showing that
tr4 represses pre-core core mrnas. dissection repressive
mechanism indicates tr4 may suppress hbv core promoter activity via
repressing hnf4alpha-mediated transactivation protein-protein interactions
without inhibition hnf4alpha dna binding. furthermore, results indicate
that n- c-terminal regions tr4 protein required tr4-hnf4alpha 
interaction. possible tr4-hnf4alpha interaction may block the
hnf4alpha function results suppression hbv gene expression.
together, results demonstrate tr4 serve negative modulator in
the transcriptional regulation hbv core gene expression.
