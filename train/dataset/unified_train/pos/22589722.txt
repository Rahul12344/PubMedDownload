epstein-barr virus (ebv) closely associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(npc), human malignancy notorious highly metastatic nature. among
ebv-encoded genes, latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) expressed npc
tissues exerts oncogenicity engaging multiple signaling pathways a
ligand-independent manner. lmp1 expression also results actin cytoskeleton
reorganization, modulates cell morphology cell motility- cellular
process regulated rhogtpases, cdc42. despite prominent association
of cdc42 activation tumorigenesis, molecular basis cdc42 activation
by lmp1 npc cells remains elucidated. using gst-cbd (active
cdc42-binding domain) bait gst pull-down assays precipitate active cdc42
from cell lysates, demonstrated lmp1 acts transmembrane
domains preferentially induce cdc42 activation various types epithelial 
cells, including npc cells. using rna interference combined re-introduction 
experiments, identified fgd4 (fyve, rhogef ph domain containing 4) 
gef (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) responsible activation cdc42 
by lmp1. serial deletion experiments co-immunoprecipitation assays further
revealed ectopically expressed fgd4 modulated lmp1-mediated cdc42 activation
by interacting lmp1. moreover, lmp1, transmembrane domains,
directly bound fgd4 enhanced fgd4 activity toward cdc42, leading actin
cytoskeleton rearrangement increased motility npc cells. depletion fgd4
or cdc42 significantly reduced (âˆ¼50%) lmp1-stimulated cell motility, an
effect partially reversed expression constitutively active
mutant cdc42. finally, quantitative rt-pcr immunohistochemistry analyses
showed fgd4 lmp1 expressed npc tissues, supporting potential
physiologically relevance mechanism npc. collectively, results not
only uncover novel mechanism underlying lmp1-mediated cdc42 activation, namely 
lmp1 interaction fgd4, also functionally link fgd4 npc tumorigenesis.
