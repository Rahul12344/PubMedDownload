hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein shown exhibit several biological
properties suggest important role liver pathogenesis and
carcinogenesis. previous study, showed core mutants, isolated
from tumour, could directly interact pkr maintain activated
form. present report, investigated interaction and
mapped core pkr domains involved. using glutathion s-transferase fusion
protein harbouring different domains core pkr, determined the
n-terminal 1-58 amino acid (aa) core protein n-terminal 1-180 aa of
pkr responsible direct interaction. using system also
confirmed core-pkr interaction induced pkr autophosphorylation.
furthermore, found core protein co-localized co-immunoprecipitated
with pkr cells expressing full-length hcv replicon, thus confirming that
this interaction occurs hcv proteins expressed. considering the
activation pkr observed cancer cell lines tissues, it
suggests that, depending cellular context, pkr may stimulate inhibit
cell proliferation. precise mapping core-pkr interaction provides new data
to study molecular mechanism underlying hcv pathogenesis.
