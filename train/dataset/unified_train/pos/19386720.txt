homologous recombination important biological process facilitates
genome rearrangement repair dna double-strand breaks (dsbs). induction
of epstein-barr virus (ebv) lytic replication induces ataxia
telangiectasia-mutated (atm)-dependent dna damage checkpoint signaling, leading
to clustering phosphorylated atm mre11/rad50/nbs1 (mrn) complexes to
sites viral genome synthesis nuclei. report homologous
recombinational repair (hrr) factors replication protein (rpa), rad51, 
and rad52 well mrn complexes recruited loaded onto newly
synthesized viral genome replication compartments. 32-kda subunit rpa
is extensively phosphorylated sites accordance atm. the
hyperphosphorylation rpa32 causes change rpa conformation, resulting a
switch catalysis dna replication participation dna repair. 
the levels rad51 phosphorylated rpa found increase the
progression viral productive replication, rad52 proved constant.
furthermore, biochemical fractionation revealed increases levels dna-bound 
forms hrrs. bromodeoxyuridine-labeled chromatin immunoprecipitation 
pcr analyses confirmed loading rpa, rad 51, rad52, mre11 onto newly
synthesized viral dna, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dutp
nick end labeling analysis demonstrated dsbs ebv replication compartments.
hrr factors might recruited repair dsbs viral genome viral
replication compartments. rna interference knockdown rpa32 rad51 prevented
viral dna synthesis remarkably, suggesting homologous recombination and/or
repair viral dna genome might occur, coupled dna replication to
facilitate viral genome synthesis.
