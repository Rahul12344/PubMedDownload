hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication involves many viral host factors. here,
we employed lentivirus-based rna interference (rnai) screening approach to
search possible cellular factors. using kinase-phosphatase rnai library 
and hcv replicon reporter system, identified serine-threonine kinase,
polo-like kinase 1 (plk1), potential host factor regulating hcv replication.
knockdown plk1 reduced hcv rna replication nonstructural (ns) protein
production hcv replicon cells hcv-infected cells not
significantly affect host cellular growth cell cycle. overexpression plk1
in knockdown cells rescued hcv replication. interestingly, ratio 
the hyperphosphorylated form (p58) basal phosphorylated form (p56) of
ns5a lower plk1 knockdown cells plk1 kinase inhibitor-treated
cells control groups. studies showed plk1 could be
immunoprecipitated together ns5a. proteins partially colocalized the
perinuclear region. furthermore, plk1 could phosphorylate ns5a p58
and p56 forms vitro assay system; phosphorylation efficiency was
comparable reported casein kinase. taken together, study
shows plk1 ns5a phosphokinase thereby indirectly regulates hcv rna
replication. differential effects plk1 hcv replication and
host cell growth, plk1 could potentially serve target anti-hcv therapy.
