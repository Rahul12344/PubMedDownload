major-histocompatibility-complex (mhc) proteins used display, the
surface cell, peptides derived foreign material - virus -
that infecting cell. cytotoxic lymphocytes recognize kill 
infected cell. hiv-1 nef protein downregulates cell-surface expression of
class mhc proteins, probably thereby promotes immune evasion hiv-1. in
the presence nef, class mhc molecules relocalized cell surface 
to trans-golgi network (tgn) as-yet-unknown mechanisms. show 
that nef-induced downregulation mhc-i expression mhc-i targeting the
tgn require binding nef pacs-1, molecule controls tgn
localization cellular protein furin. interaction dependent on
nef's cluster acidic amino acids. chimaeric integral membrane protein
containing nef cytoplasmic domain localizes tgn after
internalization, acidic-cluster- pacs-1-dependent manner. results
support model nef relocalizes mhc-i acting connector between
mhc-i's cytoplasmic tail pacs-1-dependent protein-sorting pathway.
