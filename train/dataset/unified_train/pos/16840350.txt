vaccinia virus grow chinese hamster ovary (cho-k1) cells the
absence viral host range factor, cowpox protein cp77. study, cp77
was fused c terminus green fluorescence protein (gfp-cp77) series
of nested deletion mutants gfp-cp77 constructed insertion a
vaccinia virus host range mutant, vv-hr, expressed viral early
promoter. deletion mapping analyses demonstrated n-terminal 352 amino
acids cp77 sufficient support vaccinia virus growth cho-k1 cells,
whereas c-terminal residues 353 668 dispensable. yeast two-hybrid 
analyses, cp77 bound cellular protein, hmg20a, gst pulldown analyses
showed residues 1 234 cp77 sufficient interaction. after
vv-hr virus infection cho-k1 cells, hmg20a translocated nucleus
to viral factories bound viral genome via hmg box region. in
control vv-hr-infected cho-k1 cells, binding hmg20a viral genome
persisted 2 8 h postinfection (h p.i.); contrast, cp77 was
expressed, association hmg20a viral genome transient, little
hmg20a remaining bound 8 h p.i. indicates dissociation hmg20a
from viral factories correlates well cp77 host range activity cho-k1
cells. finally, cells expressing cp77 deletion protein (amino acids 277 to
668) deltaank5 mutant support vaccinia virus growth not
contain hmg20a binding site, hmg20a remained bound viral dna,
demonstrating binding cp77 hmg20a essential host range 
function. summary, data revealed novel cellular protein, hmg20a,
the dissociation viral dna regulated cp77, providing the
first cellular target regulated viral host range cp77 protein.
