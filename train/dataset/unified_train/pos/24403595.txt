using mass spectrometry, identified p190rhogap (p190) binding partner 
human papillomavirus 16 (hpv16) e7. p190 belongs gtpase activating protein
(gap) family one primary gaps rhoa. gaps stimulate the
intrinsic gtpase activity rho proteins, leading rho inactivation and
influencing numerous biological processes. rhoa one best-characterized 
rho proteins specifically involved formation focal adhesions and
stress fibers, thereby regulating cell migration cell spreading. since this
is first report e7 associates p190, carried detailed
interaction studies. show e7 proteins hpv types also bind
p190. furthermore, found conserved region 3 (cr3) e7 middle
domain p190 important interaction. specifically, we
identified two residues cr3 e7 necessary p190 binding used
mutants e7 mutations residues determine biological
consequences e7-p190 interaction. data suggest interaction of
e7 p190 dysregulates gap alters actin cytoskeleton. also
found interaction negatively regulates cell spreading fibronectin 
substrate therefore likely contributes important aspects hpv life
cycle hpv-induced tumorigenesis.importance: study identifies p190rhogap
as novel cellular binding partner human papillomavirus (hpv) e7
protein. study shows large number different hpv e7 proteins bind
p190rhogap, identifies regions e7 p190rhogap are
important interaction occur. study also highlights likelihood
that e7-p190rhogap interaction may important biological consequences
related actin organization infected cell. changes could an
important contributor viral life cycle progression cancer in
hpv-infected cells. importantly, work also emphasizes need further
study field largely unexplored relates hpv life 
cycle hpv-induced transformation.
