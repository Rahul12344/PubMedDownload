little known immediate phases viral infection incoming 
viral genome complex counteracts host cell defenses, start viral
gene expression. adenovirus (ad) serves ideal model, since entry onset 
of gene expression rapid highly efficient, mechanisms used 24-48
hours post infection counteract host antiviral dna repair factors (e.g.
p53, mre11, daxx) well studied. here, identify even earlier host cell
target ad, chromatin-associated factor epigenetic reader, spoc1,
recently found recruited double strand breaks, playing role dna
damage response. spoc1 co-localized viral replication centers host
cell nucleus, interacted ad dna, repressed viral gene expression 
transcriptional level. discovered spoc1-mediated restriction imposed
upon ad growth relieved functional association ad major core
protein pvii enters viral genome, followed by
e1b-55k/e4orf6-dependent proteasomal degradation spoc1. mimicking removal of
spoc1 cell, knock cellular restriction factor using rnai
techniques resulted significantly increased ad replication, including enhanced
viral gene expression. however, depletion spoc1 also reduced efficiency of
e1b-55k transcriptional repression cellular promoters, possible
implications viral transformation. intriguingly, exclusive ad
infection, human pathogenic viruses (hsv-1, hsv-2, hiv-1, hcv) also
depleted spoc1 infected cells. findings provide general model how
pathogenic human viruses antagonize intrinsic spoc1-mediated antiviral responses 
in host cells. better understanding viral entry early restrictive 
functions host cells provide new perspectives developing antiviral 
agents therapies. conversely, ad vectors used gene therapy,
counteracting mechanisms eradicating incoming viral dna would increase ad vector 
efficacy safety patient.
