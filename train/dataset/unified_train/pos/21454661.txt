hiv-1 integrase (in) key viral enzymatic protein acting several viral
replication steps, including integration. shown unstable
protein degraded n-end rule pathway host ubiquitin-proteasome 
machinery. however, still fully understood viral protein is
protected host ubiquitin-proteasome system within cells hiv
replication. present study, provide evidence host protein ku70
interacts hiv-1 protects lys(48)-linked
polyubiquitination proteasomal pathway. moreover, ku70 able down-regulate
the overall protein polyubiquitination level within host cells to
specifically deubiquitinate interaction. mutagenic studies
revealed c terminus (residues 230-288) required binding 
to n-terminal part ku70 (ku70(1-430)), interaction is
independent ku70/80 heterodimerization. finally, knockdown ku70 expression 
in virus-producing target cd4(+) cells significantly disrupted hiv-1
replication rendered two-long terminal repeat circles integration
undetectable, indicating ku70 required early late
stages hiv-1 life cycle. interestingly, ku70 incorporated the
progeny virus in-dependent way. proposed ku70 may interact 
during viral assembly accompany hiv-1 upon entry new target
cells, acting 1) protect host defense system 2) assist in
integration activity. overall, report provides another example hiv-1 
hijacks host cellular machinery protect virus facilitate its
replication.
