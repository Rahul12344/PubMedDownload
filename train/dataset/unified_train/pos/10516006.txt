serpins superfamily serine proteinase inhibitors function to
regulate number key biological processes including fibrinolysis,
inflammation, cell migration. poxviruses viruses known encode
functional serpins. poxvirus serpins regulate inflammation (myxoma
virus serp1 cowpox virus [cpv] crma/spi-2) apoptosis (myxoma virus serp2
and cpv crma/spi-2), function poxvirus serpins remains unknown. 
rabbitpox virus (rpv) spi-1 protein 47% identical crma shares of
the serpin structural motifs. however, serpin-like activity been
demonstrated spi-1 date. earlier showed rpv spi-1 gene
deleted, unlike wild-type virus, fails grow a549 pk15 cells (a. ali, p. 
c. turner, m. a. brooks, r. w. moyer, virology 202:306-314, 1994). we
demonstrate absence functional spi-1 protein, infected
nonpermissive cells exhibit morphological features apoptosis fail to
activate terminal caspases cleave death substrates parp lamin a. we
show spi-1 forms stable complex vitro cathepsin g, member the
chymotrypsin family serine proteinases, consistent serpin activity. spi-1
reactive-site loop (rsl) mutations critical p1 p14 residues abolish
this activity. viruses containing spi-1 rsl p1 p14 mutations also fail 
grow a549 pk15 cells. results suggest full virus host range 
depends serpin activity spi-1 restrictive cells spi-1
inhibits proteinase chymotrypsin-like activity may function inhibit
a caspase-independent pathway apoptosis.
