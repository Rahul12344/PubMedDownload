influenza viruses encode proteases must rely host proteases for
the proteolytic activation surface hemagglutinin proteins order to
fuse infected host cells. recent progress understanding human 
proteases responsible influenza virus hemagglutinin activation led the
identification members type ii transmembrane serine proteases tmprss2
and tmprss4 human airway trypsin-like protease; however, none proved to
be sole enzyme responsible hemagglutinin cleavage. study, we
identify characterize matriptase influenza virus-activating protease
capable supporting multicycle viral replication human respiratory
epithelium. using confocal microscopy, found matriptase colocalize with
hemagglutinin apical surface human epithelial cells within
endosomes, showed soluble form protease able to
specifically cleave hemagglutinins h1 virus, h2 h3 viruses,
in broad ph range. showed small interfering rna (sirna) knockdown of
matriptase human bronchial epithelial cells significantly blocked influenza
virus replication cells. lastly, provide selective, slow,
tight-binding inhibitor matriptase significantly reduces viral
replication (by 1.5 log) h1n1 influenza virus, including 2009 pandemic
virus. study establishes three-pronged model action matriptase: 
activation incoming viruses extracellular space shed form, upon 
viral attachment exit membrane-bound and/or shed forms apical
surface epithelial cells, within endosomes membrane-bound form
where viral fusion takes place.
