infection human papillomaviruses (hpv) leads formation benign
lesions, warts, cases, cervical cancer. formation these
lesions dependent upon increased expression proangiogenic factors.
angiogenesis linked tissue hypoxia activity the
oxygen-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (hif-1α). studies indicate 
the hpv e7 protein enhances hif-1 transcriptional activity whereas e6 functions
to counteract repressive effects p53. high- low-risk hpv e7
proteins found bind hif-1α domain located n-terminus.
importantly, ability e7 enhance hif-1 activity mapped c-terminus
and correlated displacement histone deacetylases hdac1, hdac4,
and hdac7 hif-1α e7. findings describe novel role e7
oncoprotein activating function key transcription factor mediating
hypoxic responses blocking binding hdacs.
