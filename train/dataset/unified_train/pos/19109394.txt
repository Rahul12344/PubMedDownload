the papillomavirus e2 proteins regulate viral replication, gene transcription,
and genome maintenance interacting viral host proteins. 
yeast two-hybrid screen, identified cellular protein tax1bp1 novel
binding partner human papillomavirus type 18 (hpv18) e2. tax1bp1 also
interacts hpv16 bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv1) e2 proteins,
with c-terminal region tax1bp1 interacting n-terminal
transactivation domain bpv1 e2. tax1bp1 complexes p300 acts
synergistically coactivator p300 enhance e2-dependent transcription.
using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, show tax1bp1 e2 localize 
to long control region bpv1 genome. tax1bp1 recently reported to
bind ubiquitin function essential component a20
ubiquitin-editing complex. demonstrate tax1bp1 plays role the
regulation steady-state level e2 preventing proteasomal
degradation. studies provide new insights regulation e2
functions.
