human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) virion assembly takes place nucleus and
cytoplasm infected cells. hcmv virion tegument protein pp150 (ppul32) is
an essential protein hcmv suggested play role the
cytoplasmic phase hcmv assembly. define role viral assembly 
and identify host cell proteins interact pp150 viral
assembly, utilized yeast two-hybrid analyses detect interaction 
pp150 bicaudal d1 (bicd1), protein thought play role trafficking
within secretory pathway. bicd1 known interact dynein motor
complex rab6 gtpase. interaction pp150 bicd1 was
confirmed coimmunoprecipitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer.
depletion bicd1 short hairpin rna (shrna) caused decreased virus yield
and defect trafficking pp150 cytoplasmic viral assembly
compartment (ac), without altering trafficking ac another essential
tegument protein, pp28, viral glycoprotein complex gm/gn. c terminus
of bicd1 previously shown interact gtpase rab6, suggesting a
potential role rab6-mediated vesicular trafficking hcmv assembly. finally,
overexpression n terminus truncated bicd1 acts dominant-negative
manner leads disruption ac decrease assembly of
infectious virus. phenotype similar observed following
overexpression dynamitin (p50) provided additional evidence that
morphogenesis ac virus assembly dynein dependent.
