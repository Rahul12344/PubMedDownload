host cellular proteases induce influenza virus entry cells cleaving the
viral surface envelope glycoprotein hemagglutinin (ha). however, details the
cellular proteases involved event fully available. report here
that ubiquitous type ii transmembrane serine proteases, mspl splice
variant tmprss13, novel candidates proteases processing ha proteins of
highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) viruses, apart previously
identified furin proprotein convertases 5 6. hpai virus h5
and h7 strains one two cleavage site motifs, r-x-k/r-r motif r
at position p4 k-k/r-k/t-r motif k position p4. studies of
synthetic 14-residue hpai virus ha peptides cleavage site motifs,
furin preferentially cleaved ha peptides r-k-k-r motif the
presence calcium peptides motif, whereas mspl and
tmprss13 cleaved types ha peptides (those r/k-k-k-r motif)
efficiently absence calcium. full-length recombinant hpai virus ha with
the k-k-k-r cleavage motif exhibited poor susceptibility cleavage the
absence mspl tmprss13 presence furin infected cells, it
was converted mature ha subunits transfected cells expressing mspl or
tmprss13, membrane-fused giant-cell formation. conversion membrane 
fusion suppressed inhibitors mspl tmprss13. furthermore, infection
with multiplication genetically modified live hpai virus
a/crow/kyoto/53/2004 (h5n1) k-k-k-r cleavage site motif detected
only mspl- tmprss13-expressing cells.
