the ebna1 protein epstein-barr virus (ebv) plays essential roles enabling
the replication persistence ebv genomes latently infected cells and
activating ebv latent gene expression, cases binding specific
recognition sites latent origin replication, orip. show that
ebna1 binding recognition sites vitro greatly stimulated binding 
to cellular deubiquitylating enzyme, usp7, usp7 form ternary
complex dna-bound ebna1. consistent vitro effects, assembly 
of ebna1 orip elements human cells decreased usp7 silencing, whereas
assembly ebna1 mutant defective usp7 binding unaffected. usp7
affinity column profiling identified complex usp7 human gmp
synthetase (gmps), shown stimulate ability usp7 cleave
monoubiquitin histone h2b vitro. accordingly, silencing usp7 human 
cells resulted consistent increase level monoubquitylated h2b. the
usp7-gmps complex formed quaternary complex dna-bound ebna1 vitro and, 
in ebv infected cells, preferentially detected orip functional
element, fr, along ebna1. down-regulation usp7 reduced level gmps 
at fr, increased level monoubiquitylated h2b region the
origin decreased ability ebna1, ebna1 usp7-binding mutant, 
to activate transcription fr. results indicate usp7 can
stimulate ebna1-dna interactions ebna1 alter histone modification at
orip recruitment usp7.
