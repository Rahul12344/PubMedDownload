hepatitis b virus (hbv) x protein (hbx) 17-kda transcriptional coactivator
that plays significant role regulation genes involved inflammation
and cell survival. known involved development liver
cancer alteration cellular hbx level may influence pathogenesis of
hbv-induced liver diseases. transcription factor gli1, member the
glioma-associated oncogene homologue (gli) subfamily kr√ºppel-like zinc finger 
proteins involved signal transduction within hedgehog (hh) signaling
pathway, involved development many human malignancies. gli
activation important cell proliferation anti-apoptosis various
cancers. investigate whether transcriptional coactivator hbx binds 
zinc finger transcription factor gli1, recombinant hbx gli1 isolated.
expression purification hbx gli1 proteins successfully
performed escherichia coli. binding hbx gli1 detected surface
plasmon resonance spectroscopy (biacore), fluorescence measurement, a
his-tagged pull-down experiment. measuring fluorescence emission
spectra purified hbx gli1, found interaction these
proteins accompanied significant conformational changes one both.
this study provides important clues structural identification signal
transduction pathways involving hbx gli1 proteins.
