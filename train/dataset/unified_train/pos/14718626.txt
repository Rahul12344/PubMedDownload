the predicted extracellular domain cd2v protein african swine fever
virus (asfv) shares significant similarity cd2 protein cells 
but unique cytoplasmic domain unknown function. shown 
cd2v expressed glycoprotein approximately 105 kda asfv-infected
cells. absence extracellular ligand, majority cd2v appears to
localize perinuclear membrane compartments. furthermore, shown using
the yeast two-hybrid system direct binding studies cytoplasmic
tail cd2v binds cytoplasmic adaptor protein sh3p7 (mabp1, hip55), which
has reported involved diverse cellular functions vesicle
transport signal transduction. cdna clone encoding variant form sh3p7 
could also identified found expressed wide range porcine
tissues. deletion mutagenesis identified proline-rich repeats sequence pppkpc 
in asfv cd2v protein necessary sufficient binding sh3
domain sh3p7. asfv-infected cells, cd2v sh3p7 co-localized areas
surrounding perinuclear virus factories. areas also stained an
antibody recognizes golgi network protein, indicating contained 
membranes derived golgi network. data provide first molecular
basis understanding immunomodulatory functions cd2v in
asfv-infected animals.
