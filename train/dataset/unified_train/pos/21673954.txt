persistent infections hepatitis c virus (hcv) known major risk
factor causing hepatocellular carcinomas. nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) of
hcv serine protease rna helicase domains, essential viral 
replication. further, ns3 also considered involved development of
hcv-induced hepatocellular carcinomas. report, focus function
of ns3 protein, propose novel possible molecular mechanism thought
to related tumorigenesis caused persistent infection hcv. 
identified srcap (snf2-related cbp activator protein) ns3 binding protein
using yeast two-hybrid screening, co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated
that ns3 bind srcap mammalian cells. results reporter gene
assay using hes-1 promoter known target gene activated notch,
indicate ns3 srcap cooperatively activate hes-1 promoter hep3b
cells. addition, show report also p400, known a
protein closely resembling srcap, would targeted ns3. ns3 exhibited binding
activity also 1449-1808 region p400 co-immunoprecipitation assay, 
and activation notch-mediated transcription hes-1 promoter 
by ns3 decreased significantly combined silencing srcap p400 mrna
using short hairpin rna. results suggest hcv ns3 protein is
involved activation notch-signaling pathway targeting
to srcap p400.
