human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infects central nervous system
and plays direct role pathogenesis aids dementia. however, the
molecular mechanisms underlying hiv-1 expression central nervous system
are poorly understood. recently reported nuclear receptor
chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (coup-tf), orphan
member nuclear receptor superfamily, activator hiv-1 gene
transcription. here, results show coup-tf stimulates hiv-1 transcription
in primary cultured human microglial cells, primary target hiv-1
infection brain. run-on assays indicated coup-tf acts initiation
step transcription. results reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction immunocytochemistry analysis revealed importance this
factor demonstrating overexpression coup-tf leads initiation of
viral replication primary hiv-infected human microglia. addition, coup-tf
is able physically interact cooperate viral transactivator tat.
the combination coup-tf tat leads nf-kappab- sp1-independent
enhanced transcriptional stimulation. vitro binding studies showed that
coup-tf interacts tat amino acids within n-terminal dna-binding 
domain coup-tf. amino acids 48-72 basic c-terminal regions tat
are required binding tat coup-tf. results suggest that
coup-tf essential transcription factor involved hiv-1 expression in
microglia reveal novel interplay tat coup-tf regulation of
viral expression.
