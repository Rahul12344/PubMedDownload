the activating immunoreceptor nkg2d promotes elimination infected malignant
cells cytotoxic lymphocytes engagement stress-induced mhc class
i-related ligands. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)-encoded immunoevasin ul16
subverts nkg2d-mediated immune responses retaining select group diverse
nkg2d ligands inside cell. report crystal structure ul16 in
complex nkg2d ligand micb 1.8 resolution, revealing molecular
basis promiscuous, highly selective, binding ul16 unrelated
nkg2d ligands. immunoglobulin-like ul16 protein utilizes three-stranded
beta-sheet engage alpha-helical surface mhc class i-like micb
platform domain. intriguingly, residues center beta-sheet mimic 
central binding motif employed structurally unrelated c-type lectin-like
nkg2d facilitate engagement diverse nkg2d ligands. using surface plasmon
resonance, find ul16 binds micb, ulbp1, ulbp2 similar affinities
that lie nanomolar range (12-66 nm). ability ul16 bind its
ligands depends critically presence glutamine (micb) closely
related glutamate (ulbp1 ulbp2) position 169. arginine residue 
position however, found example mica ulbp3, would cause steric
clashes ul16 residues. inability ul16 bind mica ulbp3 can
therefore attributed single substitutions key nkg2d ligand locations.
this indicates selective pressure exerted viral immunoevasins as
ul16 contributed diversification nkg2d ligands.
