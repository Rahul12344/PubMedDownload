tip herpesvirus saimiri associates lck down-regulates lck-mediated
activation. identified novel cellular tip-associated protein (tap) a
yeast two-hybrid screen. tap associated tip following transient expression
in cos-1 cells stable expression human jurkat-t cells. expression tip
and tap jurkat-t cells induced dramatic cell aggregation. aggregation was
likely caused up-regulated surface expression adhesion molecules
including integrin alpha, l-selectin, icam-3, h-cam. furthermore, nf-kappab
transcriptional factor aggregated cells approximately 40-fold higher
activity parental cells. thus, tap likely important
cellular mediator tip function cell transformation herpesvirus
saimiri.
