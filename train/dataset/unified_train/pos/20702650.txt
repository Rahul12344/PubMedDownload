the small hydrophobic (sh) protein mumps virus reported interfere 
with innate immunity inhibiting tumour necrosis factor alpha-mediated
apoptosis. yeast two-hybrid screen identified ataxin-1
ubiquitin-like interacting protein (a1up) cellular target sh protein.
a1up contains amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (ubl) domain, carboxy-terminal
ubiquitin-associated (uba) domain two stress-inducible heat shock
chaperonin-binding (sti1) motifs. places within ubiquitin-like
protein family involved proteasome-mediated activities.
co-immunoprecipitation confirmed binding sh a1up demonstrates that
a truncated protein fragment corresponding aa&emsp14;136-270 a1up, which
represents first sti1-like repeat adjacent hydrophobic region, was
sufficient interaction, whereas neither ubl uba domains were
required interaction. ectopic expression a1up leads a
redistribution sh punctate structures co-localize 20s
proteasome transfected infected mammalian cells.
