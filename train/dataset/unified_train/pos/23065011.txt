the human papilloma virus e4 protein highly expressed late times of
infection. evidence date suggests e4 essential amplification of
the viral genome influence cell cycle. examination the
sequences encoding e4 proteins several genotypes human papillomavirus
revealed presence rxl-containing motifs reminiscent cyclin-binding 
motifs identified several cyclin-binding proteins. when
baculovirus-produced human cyclin e cyclin cdk2 incubated in
vitro gst-e4 fusion protein, cyclin e stably interacted with
the gst-e4 protein containing full e4 sequence hpv18. interaction
was dependent presence kinase subunit dependent 
integrity rxl motif e4. incubated cell extracts c33a
human cervical carcinoma cell line expressed c33a cells, gst-e4
protein formed interactions cyclin cdk2 kinase activity could be
demonstrated gst-e4 complex. contrast baculovirus-produced
cyclin e, cellular cyclin e failed detectably interact gst-e4 suggesting 
that hpv18 e4 sequences capable interacting cyclin in
mammalian cells. observations suggest human papillomavirus e4 proteins
can interact cyclin a/cdk2, may contribute viral manipulation of
the host cell cycle.
