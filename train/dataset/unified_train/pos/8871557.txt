previously, showed viral transactivator proteins e1a vp16
specifically interact cellular ctd kinase activity vitro. report
that e1a vp16 complexes contain human cdk8, newly identified member 
cyclin-dependent kinase family shown component rna
polymerase ii (rnap ii) holoenzyme complex. presence cdk8 e1a- 
vp16-containing complexes specific functional activation domain these
viral transactivators, strongly suggesting association relevant 
the transactivation function e1a vp16. show cdk8 associated
with ctd kinase activity cdk8 co-fractionates e1a- and
vp16-associated ctd kinase activity several chromatography columns.
therefore, cdk8 likely responsible e1a- vp16-associated ctd kinase
activity. gel filtration chromatography indicates e1a- and
vp16-associated ctd kinase activity molecular size approximately 1.5 mda
and contains cyclin c human homolog srb7 addition cdk8. this
implies e1a vp16 associate rnap ii holoenyzme. also looked
at transcriptional activity cdk8 found cdk8 function a
transcriptional activator fused dna binding domain gal4.
surprisingly, ability gal4-cdk8 activate transcription assay
was dependent kinase activity cdk8, since kinase-deficient mutant
of cdk8 stimulated transcription nearly well wild-type gal4-cdk8. this
suggests cdk8 may play role transcription distinct its
ability function ctd kinase.
