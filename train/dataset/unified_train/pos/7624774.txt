human papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated majority cervical
cancers encode transforming protein, e6, interacts tumor
suppressor protein p53. e6 p53-independent transforming activity, the
yeast two-hybrid system used search e6-binding proteins. one
such protein, e6bp, interacted cancer-associated hpv e6 bovine
papillomavirus type 1 (bpv-1) e6. transforming activity bpv-1 e6 mutants
correlated e6bp-binding ability. e6bp identical putative
calcium-binding protein, erc-55, appears localized endoplasmic 
reticulum.
