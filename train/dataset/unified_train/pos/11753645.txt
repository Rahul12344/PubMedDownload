e7 major transforming protein human papillomavirus (hpv), is
implicated development cervical cancer. transforming activity e7
has attributed part interaction retinoblastoma (rb)
tumour suppressor; however, rb interaction alone sufficient for
transformation e7. screen cellular targets hpv e7, identified
the ski interacting protein, skip, new interacting partner e7. show
that hpv-16 e7 associates skip via sequences carboxy terminal region,
and evolutionarily conserved proline rich sequences (prs) snw domain
of skip. e7 functionally targets skip vivo inhibits transcriptional
activation activity. two transformation defective mutants e7 identified
that failed bind skip inhibit transcriptional activity. 
results suggest inhibition skip function may contribute cell
transformation hpv-16 e7.
