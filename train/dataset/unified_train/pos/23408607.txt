tripartite motif (trim) protein superfamily members emerging important
effectors innate immune response viral infections. particular, 
trim22 reported exert antiviral activity rna viruses, as
hepatitis b virus (hbv), encephalomyocarditis virus (ecmv), human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). demonstrate here, first time,
that trim22 upregulated influenza virus (iav) infection mrna 
protein levels human alveolar epithelial a549 cells. conversely, trim22
potently restricted iav replication, prevention trim22 expression by
means short hairpin rna led 10-fold enhancement iav replication in
these cells. depletion trim22 also reduced anti-iav activity alpha
interferon (ifn-Î±), suggesting trim22 important ifn-stimulated gene
that required maximal suppression iav type ifn. furthermore, the
iav infectious titer decreased 100-fold mdck cells expressing exogenous 
human trim22. restriction iav replication accounted interaction
between trim22 viral nucleoprotein (np), resulting its
polyubiquitination degradation proteasome-dependent manner. thus, trim22
represents novel restriction factor upregulated upon iav infection that
curtails replicative capacity epithelial cells.
