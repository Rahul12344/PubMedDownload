background: tax oncoproteins transcriptional regulators viral
expression involved pathogenesis induced complex leukemogenic retroviruses 
(or delta-retroviruses, i.e., primate t-cell leukemia viruses bovine leukemia
virus). better understand molecular pathways leading cell
transformation, aimed identify cellular proteins interacting tax.
methods: used yeast two-hybrid system identify interacting cellular
proteins. interactions tax candidate interacting cellular proteins
were confirmed glutathione s-transferase (gst) pulldown assays,
co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy. functional interactions 
tax one interacting protein, tristetraprolin (ttp), assessed by
analyzing expression tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), is
regulated ttp, mammalian cells (hela, d17, hek 293, raw 264.7)
transiently transfected combinations intact mutant tax ttp.
results: obtained seven interacting cellular proteins, one, ttp, 
further characterized. tax ttp found interact specifically through
their respective carboxyl-terminal domains. proteins colocalized the
cytoplasm region surrounding nucleus hela cells. furthermore,
coexpression tax associated nuclear accumulation ttp. ttp an
immediate-early protein inhibits expression tnf-alpha the
post-transcriptional level. expression tax reverted inhibition, in
transient transfection experiments stably transfected macrophage cell
lines.
conclusion: tax, interactions ttp repressor, indirectly
increases tnf-alpha expression. observation importance cell
transformation process induced leukemogenic retroviruses, tnf-alpha
overexpression plays central role pathogenesis.
