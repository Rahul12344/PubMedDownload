an at-rich region human cytomegalovirus (cmv) genome ul127
open reading frame major immediate-early (mie) enhancer referred as
the unique region (ur). shown ur represses activation of
transcription ul127 promoter functions boundary the
divergent ul127 mie genes human cmv infection [angulo, a., kerry, d., 
huang, h., borst, e.m., razinsky, a., wu, j., hobom, u., messerle, m., ghazal,

fox-like region remain determined. reported previously that
pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (pdx1) bound 45-bp element located
within ur [chao, s.h., harada, j.n., hyndman, f., gao, x., nelson, c.g.,

biol. chem. 279 (16), 16111-16120]. demonstrate two additional
cellular homeoproteins, special at-rich sequence binding protein 1 (satb1) and
ccaat displacement protein (cdp), bind human cmv ur vitro vivo. 
furthermore, cdp identified fox-like binding protein repressor of
the ul127 promoter, satb1 effect ul127 expression. since cdp is
known transcription repressor nuclear matrix-associated region binding
protein, cdp may role regulation human cmv transcription.
