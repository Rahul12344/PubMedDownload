the mechanisms attachment penetration hepatitis b virus remain
obscure. demonstrated pres1 region essential viral
assembly infectivity, however, cellular receptor still been
identified unequivocally, used yeast two-hybrid system screen the
cellular proteins interact pres1 protein. protein recovered
from human liver cdna library nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha 
polypeptide. interaction pres1 nascent polypeptide-associated
complex alpha polypeptide verified mating experiment and
coimmunoprecipitation cos7 cell lysates expressing proteins. based on
these results, speculate nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha
polypeptide functional target hepatitis b virus pres1 protein cells.
