a major entry route gammaretrovirus amphotropic murine leukemia virus
(a-mlv) nih 3t3 fibroblasts via caveola-dependent endocytosis. however,
during infection time, viral particles observed intracellularly.
analyzing dynamics a-mlv infection process using total internal
reflection fluorescence microscopy, show majority viruses are
extracellular bound fibronectin matrix. moreover, amounts bound
virus fibronectin correlated. using confocal microscopy, nanoparticles
targeted fibronectin iii1c-fibronectin fragment anti-fibronectin
antibody detected intracellularly nih 3t3 cells; unconjugated
nanoparticles neither bound cells detectable intracellularly.
furthermore, a-mlv colocalized intracellularly fibronectin-targeted
nanoparticles, suggesting taken cellular pathway.
both a-mlv entry fibronectin turnover depend caveolar endocytosis, 
found inhibiting viral binding extracellular nih 3t3
fibronectin-matrix dramatically reduced a-mlv infection, indeed, showing an
active role fibronectin infection. suggest binding cellular 
fibronectin matrix provides new mechanism viruses enter cells.
