hbv (hepatitis b virus) primary cause chronic liver disease, which
frequently results hepatitis, cirrhosis ultimately hcc (hepatocellular
carcinoma). recently, showed hbx (hbv protein x) expression induces lipid
accumulation hepatic cells mediated induction srebp1
(sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein 1), key regulator lipogenic genes
in liver. however, molecular mechanisms hbx increases srebp1
expression transactivation remain clearly elucidated. present
study, demonstrated hbx interacts lxralpha (liver x receptor alpha) 
and enhances binding lxralpha lxre (lxr-response element), thereby
resulting up-regulation srebp1 fas (fatty acid synthase) the
presence absence lxr agonist t0901317 hepatic cells and
hbx-transgenic mice. furthermore, hbx also augments ability recruit asc2
(activating signal co-integrator 2), transcriptional co-activator controls
liver lipid metabolic pathways, lxre lxralpha. studies place
lxralpha key position within hbx-induced lipogenic pathways, suggest
a molecular mechanism hbv infection stimulate the
srebp1-mediated control hepatic lipid accumulation.
