the hepatitis c virus associated development liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinomas. among 10 polyproteins produced virus, no
function clearly assigned non-structural 5a (ns5a) protein. 
study designed identify hepatocellular proteins interact with
ns5a hcv. yeast two-hybrid experiments performed human liver
cdna prey-library, using five different ns5a derivatives baits, the
full-length ns5a (ns5a-f, amino acid (aa) 1 approximately 447) four
different derivatives, denoted ns5a-a (aa 1 approximately 150), -b (aa 1
approximately 300), -c (aa 300 approximately 447) (aa 150 approximately
447). ns5a-f, ns5a-b ns5a-c gave two, two 10 candidate clones,
respectively, including ahnak-related protein, secreted frizzled-related
protein 4 (sfrp4), n-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (ndrg1), cellular
retinoic acid binding protein 1 (crabp-1), ferritin heavy chain (fth1),
translokin, tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (tacstd2),
phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (pi4k) centaurindelta 2 (centdelta2). however, 
ns5a-a produced candidates ns5a-d suitable bait due to
transcriptional activity. based vitro binding assay, crabp-1, pi4k,
centdelta2 two unknown fusion proteins maltose binding protein (mbp),
were confirmed interact glutathione s-transferase (gst)/ns5a fusion
protein. furthermore, interactions crabp-1, pi4k centdelta2 not
related pxxp motif (class ii), judged domain analysis. their
biological relevance investigation, results contribute better
understanding possible role ns5a hepatocellular signaling pathways.
