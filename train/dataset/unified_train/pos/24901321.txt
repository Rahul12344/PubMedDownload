the nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) considered one crucial viral
proteins replication pathogenesis porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv). present study, host cellular
proteins interact nsp2 prrsv immunoprecipitated with
anti-myc antibody marc-145 cells infected recombinant prrsv with
3xmyc tag insertion nsp2-coding region, 285 cellular proteins
interacting nsp2 identified lc-ms/ms. gene ontology enriched
kegg pathway bioinformatics analyses indicated identified proteins could
be assigned different subcellular locations functional classes. functional
analysis interactome profile highlighted cellular pathways associated with
infectious disease, translation, immune system, nervous system signal
transduction. two interested cellular proteins-bcl2-associated athanogene 6
(bag6) apoptosis-inducing factor 1 (aif1) may involve transporting
of nsp2 endoplasmic reticulum (er) prrsv-driven apoptosis validated by
western blot. interactome data prrsv nsp2 cellular proteins
contribute understanding roles nsp2 replication and
pathogenesis prrsv, also provide novel cellular target proteins for
elucidating associated molecular mechanisms interaction host
cellular proteins viral proteins regulating viral replication.
