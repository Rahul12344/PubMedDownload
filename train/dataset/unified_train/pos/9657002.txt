functional analysis two promoters controlling early herpes simplex virus type 
1 (hsv-1) transcripts encoding ul37 ul50 (dutpase) proteins described
in report. transcripts expressed control promoters were
found expressed early regardless position transcription unit 
within viral genome. despite this, wt dutpase mrna 6-10 times more
abundant ul37 transcript wt recombinant viruses. same
difference transcript abundance seen reporter gene
(beta-galactosidase) controlled two promoters recombinant viruses
in heterologous glycoprotein c (gc) locus. thus, kinetics and
relative abundance ul50 ul37 transcripts direct function their
respective promoter regulatory elements. characterization mutated ul37 and
ul50 promoters recombinant viruses showed functional modules
important expression promoters concentrated upstream the
transcription start site; however extent composition modules 
terms cis-acting elements contain different each. the
ul37 promoter, hinf-p factor binding site (-53 -58 bp) tata
homology (-22 -27) required detectable expression, sp1
binding site -123 augmented absolutely required. contrast,
the functional elements crucial expression ul50 promoter were
the tata box (-25 -31) sp1 binding site -117 bp relative cap 
site. despite differences detail, functional architecture these
two early promoters compared extensively characterized hsv-1
thymidine kinase (ul23) promoter, class-specific similarities clearly
apparent.
