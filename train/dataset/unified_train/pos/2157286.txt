human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) dna tumor virus associated
with human anogenital cancers encodes two transforming proteins, e6 e7.
the e7 protein shown bind retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene
product, prb. study shows e6 protein hpv-16 capable of
binding cellular p53 protein. ability e6 proteins from
different human papillomaviruses form complexes p53 assayed found
to correlate vivo clinical behavior vitro transforming
activity different papillomaviruses. wild-type p53 protein tumor
suppressor properties also found association large antigen
and e1b 55-kilodalton protein cells transformed sv40 adenovirus 
type 5, respectively, providing evidence human papillomaviruses,
the adenoviruses, sv40 may effect similar cellular pathways in
transformation.
