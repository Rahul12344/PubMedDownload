the members oligoadenylate synthetase (oas) family proteins are
antiviral restriction factors target wide range rna dna viruses.
they function intracellular double-stranded rna (dsrna) sensors that, upon
binding dsrna, undergo conformational change activated synthesize
2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates (2-5as). 2-5as sufficient length act second
messengers activate rnase l thereby restrict viral replication. we
expressed human oas3 using baculovirus system purified homogeneity.
we show recombinant oas3 activated substantially lower concentration
of dsrna oas1, making potent vivo sensor dsrna. moreover, find
that oas3 synthesizes considerably longer 2-5as previously reported, and
that oas3 activate rnase l intracellularly. combined high affinity for
dsrna capability produce 2-5as sufficient length activate rnase 
l suggests oas3 potent activator rnase l. addition, provide
experimental evidence support one active site oas3 located the
c-terminal oas domain generate low-resolution structure oas3 using
saxs.importance: first purify oas3 enzyme homogeneity, which
allowed us characterize mechanism utilized oas3 identify active
site. provide compelling evidence oas3 produce 2'-5'-oligoadenylates 
of sufficient length activate rnase l. contrary described
in current literature agrees recent vivo data showing oas3
harbors antiviral activity requiring rnase l. thus, work redefines our
understanding biological role oas3. furthermore, used combination 
of mutagenesis small-angle x-ray scattering describe active site and
low-resolution structure oas3.
