natural killer (nk) cells innate immune cells able rapidly kill
virus-infected tumor cells. two nk cell populations found blood;
the majority (90%) expresses cd16 receptor also express cd56 protein 
in intermediate levels (cd56(dim) cd16(pos)) remaining 10% cd16
negative express cd56 high levels (cd56(bright) cd16(neg)). nk cells also 
reside tissues traffic various infected organs usage
of different chemokines chemokine receptors. kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (kshv) human virus developed numerous sophisticated and
versatile strategies escape attack immune cells nk cells. here,
we investigate whether kshv derived cytokine (vil-6) chemokines (vmip-i, 
vmip-ii, vmip-iii) affect nk cell activity. using transwell migration assays,
kshv infected cells, well fusion recombinant proteins, show out
of four cytokine/chemokines encoded kshv, vmip-ii one that
binds majority nk cells, affecting migration. demonstrate that
vmip-ii binds two different receptors, cx3cr1 ccr5, expressed naïve
cd56(dim) cd16(pos) nk cells activated nk cells, respectively. furthermore,
we show binding vmip-ii cx3cr1 ccr5 blocks binding 
natural ligands receptors, fractalkine (fck) rantes, respectively.
finally, show vmip-ii inhibits migration naïve activated nk
cells towards fck rantes. thus, present novel mechanism which
kshv uses unique protein antagonizes activity two distinct
chemokine receptors inhibit migration naïve activated nk cells.
