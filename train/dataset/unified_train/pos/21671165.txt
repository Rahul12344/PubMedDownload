murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) ie3 protein multifunctional viral protein that
interacts several target proteins viral host cellular origin. to
investigate biological function ie3 pathogenesis brain
disorders caused cmv, screening host cellular proteins could
interact ie3 performed. yeast two-hybrid screening, ankyrin repeats
domain 17 (ankrd17, also known gtar) identified host factor that
could interact ie3. interaction verified yeast two-hybrid assay 
and chemiluminescent co-immunoprecipitaion. mapping analysis suggested the
1-148 residues ie3 responsible interaction. results
suggested interaction ankrd17 ie3 may play key role the
pathogenesis mcmv-associated disease.
