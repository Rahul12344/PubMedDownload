lentiviruses, human immunodeficiency viruses (hivs), simian immunodeficiency 
viruses (sivs) distinguished oncoretroviruses ability infect
nondividing cells macrophages. retroviruses must gain access host 
cell nucleus replication propagation. hiv siv preintegration
complexes (pic) enter nuclei traversing central aqueous channel 
limiting nuclear pore complex without membrane breakdown. among nucleophilic 
proteins, namely, matrix, integrase, vpx, vpr, present hiv type 2/siv pic,
vpx implicated nuclear targeting also available incorporation
into budding virions plasma membrane. mechanisms two opposite
functions known. demonstrate vpx nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
protein contains two novel noncanonical nuclear import signals a
leptomycin b-sensitive nuclear export signal. addition, vpx interacts the
cellular tyrosine kinase fyn c-terminal proline-rich motif.
furthermore, data indicate fyn kinase phosphorylates vpx regulates
its export nucleus. replacement conserved tryptophan residues within
domain 41 63 tyrosine residues positions 66, 69, 71 vpx impairs 
its nuclear export, virion incorporation, siv replication macrophages.
nuclear export essential ensure availability vpx cytoplasm
for incorporation virions, leading efficient viral replication within
nondividing cells.
