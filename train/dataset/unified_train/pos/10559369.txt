previously demonstrated murine retroviral gag proteins associate a
cellular motor protein, kif-4. using yeast two-hybrid assay, also found an
association kif-4 gag proteins mason-pfizer monkey virus (mpmv),
simian immunodeficiency virus (siv), human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1). studies performed mammalian cell systems confirmed hiv-1
gag protein associates kif-4. soluble cytoplasmic proteins cells
infected recombinant vaccinia virus expressing entire gag-pol precursor 
protein hiv-1 transfected hiv-1 molecular clone pnl4-3 were
fractionated sucrose gradient centrifugation separated by
size-exclusion anion-exchange chromatographies. kif-4 hiv-1 gag
cofractionated chromatographic separations. immunoprecipitation assays
have also verified kif-4-gag association. kif-4 binds mainly gag
precursor (pr55 gag) matrix-capsid processing intermediate (pr42) not
to processed gag products. binding gag mediated domain of
kif-4 proximal c terminus. results, previous studies, raise 
the possibility kif-4 may play important role retrovirus gag protein
transport.
