employing yeast two-hybrid system, tat protein human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) shown interact region spanning the
egf-like repeats 1-6 mouse notch1, human notch2 drosophila
notch. observation confirmed mammalian cells demonstrating an
interaction hiv tat egf-like repeats 1-6 various notch
proteins. hiv tat protein interacted also full-length mouse notch1
receptor co-expressed mammalian cells. moreover, hiv tat protein
interacted also egf-like repeats 1-4-spanning domain human egf
precursor. ability hiv tat protein interact notch proteins
and possibly egf-like repeats-bearing proteins, suggests such
interactions might modulate physiological functions, thus affecting various
aids-associated pathologies.
