leukotropic human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) establishes persistent infection
associated inflammatory diseases encodes chemokines could
chemoattract leukocytes infection inflammation. hhv-6 variant encodes 
distant chemokine homolog, u83a, polymorphism promoting secreted form was
identified. u83a three n-terminal modifications expressed purified, 
and activities compared spliced truncated isoform, u83a-npep. u83a
efficiently potently induced calcium mobilization cells expressing single 
human ccr1, ccr4, ccr6, ccr8, ec50 values <10 nm. u83a also induced
chemotaxis th2-like leukemic cells expressing ccr4 ccr8. high-affinity
binding, 0.4 nm, demonstrated ccr1 ccr5 monocytic/macrophage cells,
and pretreatment u83a modified forms could block responses endogenous
ligands. u83a-npep acted antagonist, efficiently blocking binding ccl3
to ccr1 ccr5 differentiated monocytic/macrophage leukemic cells.
furthermore, ccl3 induction calcium signaling via ccr1 ccl1 induced
chemotaxis via ccr8 primary human leukocytes inhibited. thus, this
blocking early expressed u83a-npep could mediate immune evasion before
finishing replicative cycle. however, late infection, full-length
u83a made, chemoattraction ccr1-, ccr4-, ccr5-, ccr6-, ccr8-bearing
monocytic/macrophage, dendritic, lymphocyte cells facilitate
dissemination via lytic latent infection cells. further
implications neuroinflammatory diseases multiple sclerosis, where
both cells bearing ccr1/ccr5 plus ligands, well hhv-6a, been
linked. applications also discussed include novel vaccines/immunotherapeutics for
cancer hiv well anti-inflammatories.
