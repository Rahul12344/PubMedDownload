staufen1 (stau1), host cellular protein, along non-structural protein 1
(ns1), influenza viral protein, associate influenza
viral infection down-regulation stau1 rna interference reduces the
yield influenza virus, suggesting role stau1 viral replication. 
order develop new tool control influenza virus, determined the
specific regions staufen1 protein involved interaction ns1. the
linker rbd3 4 isolated binding regions. expression of
rbd3l, linker including rbd3, inhibited interaction stau1 and
ns1, reducing colocalization two proteins cytosol nucleus
regions. addition, yield influenza virus rbd3l-expressing cells was
significantly reduced 36 h infection. results suggest disruption
of stau1-ns1 interaction used control replication influenza a
virus, thereby providing target development antiviral drugs.
