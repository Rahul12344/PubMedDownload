kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) latency characterized the
highly regulated transcription viral genes essential genome
maintenance host cell survival. major latency control region been
identified upstream divergent promoters multicistronic transcripts
encoding lana (orf73), vcyclin (orf72), vflip (orf71) the
complementary strand transcript encoding k14 vgpcr (orf74). previous studies 
have shown major latency control region occupied cellular
chromatin boundary factor ctcf chromosome structural maintenance proteins
smc1, smc3, rad21, comprise cohesin complex. deletion the
ctcf-cohesin binding site caused inhibition cell growth viral genome
instability. show kshv genes regulated ctcf-cohesin 
cell cycle control mutation ctcf binding sites abolished cell
cycle-regulated transcription. cohesin subunits assembled ctcf binding
sites bound ctcf proteins cell cycle-dependent manner. subcellular
distribution ctcf colocalization cohesins also varied across cell
cycle. ectopic expression rad21 repressed ctcf-regulated transcription kshv
lytic genes, rad21-ctcf chimeric protein converted ctcf efficient
transcriptional repressor kshv genes normally activated g(2) phase. 
conclude cohesins interact ctcf mid-s phase repress
ctcf-regulated genes cell cycle-dependent manner. propose the
ctcf-cohesin complex plays critical role regulating cell cycle control
of viral gene expression latency failure maintain cell cycle
control latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation survival.
