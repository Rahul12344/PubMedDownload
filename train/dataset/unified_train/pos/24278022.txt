the mechanisms human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) crosses
mucosal surfaces establish infection unknown. acidic genital secretions of
hiv-1-infected women contain hiv-1 likely coated antibody. found the
combination acidic ph env-specific igg, including cervicovaginal
and seminal fluids hiv-1-infected individuals, augmented transcytosis across
epithelial cells much 20-fold compared env-specific igg neutral ph 
or non-specific igg either ph. enhanced transcytosis observed with
clinical hiv-1 isolates, including transmitted/founder strains, was
eliminated fc neonatal receptor (fcrn)-knockdown epithelial cells.
non-neutralizing antibodies allowed similar less transcytosis than
neutralizing antibodies. however, ratio total:infectious virus higher 
for neutralizing antibodies, indicating allowed transcytosis while
blocking infectivity transcytosed virus. immunocytochemistry revealed abundant
fcrn expression columnar epithelia lining human endocervix penile
urethra. acidity env-specific igg enhance transcytosis virus across
epithelial cells via fcrn could facilitate translocation virus to
susceptible target cells following sexual exposure.
