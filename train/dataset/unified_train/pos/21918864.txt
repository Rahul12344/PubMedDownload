hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx protein) multifunctional regulatory
protein. transactivation nuclear factor kappa b (nf-κb) hbx protein has
been shown importance pathogenesis hbv-related diseases.
however, mechanism involved remains largely unclear. study, a
cytotrap yeast two-hybrid system employed screen binding partners the
hbx protein; 29 cellular proteins, including valosin-containing protein (vcp),
were identified. interaction hbx protein vcp further
confirmed vitro vivo using glutathione s-transferase pull-down assay 
and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. also shown interaction
is mediated amino acid residues 51-120 hbx protein. huh-7 hepatoma
cells, hbx protein enhanced vcp-mediated activation nf-κb. findings
provide new insights molecular mechanisms lead activation of
nf-κb hbx protein.
