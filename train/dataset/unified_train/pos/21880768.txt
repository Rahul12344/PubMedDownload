the interferon-inducible sp100 proteins thought play roles the
chromatin pathway transcriptional regulation. sp100a, smallest
isoform, one major components pml nuclear bodies (nbs) exhibit 
intrinsic antiviral activity several viruses. since pml nbs disrupted
by immediate-early 1 (ie1) protein human cytomegalovirus (hcmv)
infection, modulation sp100 protein expression activity during
infection suggested. here, show sp100 proteins lost largely 
in late stages hcmv infection. event required viral gene expression
and involved posttranscriptional control. mutant virus deletion the
sequence ie1 (cr208) sp100 loss. cr208 infection, pml
depletion rna interference abrogated accumulation sumo-modified sp100a 
and certain high-molecular-weight sp100 isoforms significantly
affect unmodified sp100a, suggesting ie1-induced disruption pml nbs
is sufficient complete loss sp100 proteins. sp100a loss found 
to require proteasome activity. depletion sp100 proteins rna silencing 
enhanced hcmv replication major ie (mie) gene expression. sp100 knockdown
enhanced acetylation level histones associated mie promoter,
demonstrating repressive effect sp100 proteins may involve, least 
in part, epigenetic control mie promoter. sp100a found interact
directly ie1 n-terminal dimerization domain. findings
indicate ie1-dependent loss sp100 proteins hcmv infection may 
represent important requirement efficient viral growth.
