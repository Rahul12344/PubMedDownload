the binding androgen-receptor complexes fragments derived two alpha
2u-globulin genes (rap 01 rao 01) studied using dna-cellulose
competition assay. rat prostate cytosol labelled [3h]mibolerone used 
a source androgen receptor. two controls included studies:
the long terminal repeat (ltr) mouse mammary tumor virus previously 
been shown act androgen response element fragment c3 gene
of prostatic binding protein demonstrated bind
androgen-receptor complexes. experiments indicate androgen-receptor
complexes bind specifically comparable affinity c3 gene fragment,
the ltr fragment rap 01 located 5'-upstream region (bp -642 to
-584). specific interaction observed fragments derived rao 01.
the region rap 01 binds androgen-receptor complexes previously 
shown interact glucocorticoid receptors contains 17 bp sequence
homologous consensus sequence glucocorticoid-receptor binding. a
mutation sequence rao 01 may responsible loss of
glucocorticoid androgen-receptor binding. concluded least one
member alpha 2u-globulin gene family interacts directly with
androgen-receptor complexes affinity comparable observed for
other androgen-dependent genes. binding observed region displaying
also affinity glucocorticoid receptor.
