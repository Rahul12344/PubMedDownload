the coxsackievirus adenovirus receptor (car) essential regulator of
cell growth adhesion development. gene car, cxadr, located 
within genomic locus usher syndrome type 1e (ush1e). based 
physical interaction harmonin, protein responsible ush1c, we
hypothesized car may involved cochlear development mutations 
in cxadr may responsible ush1e. expression car cochlea was
determined pcr immunofluorescence microscopy. found car expression
is highly regulated development. neonatal mice, car localized the
junctions cochlear cell types restricted supporting and
strial cells adult cochlea. screen two populations consisting of
non-syndromic deaf usher 1 patients mutations cxadr revealed one
haploid mutation (p356s). cell surface expression, viral receptor activity, and
localization mutant form car indistinguishable wild-type car.
although unable confirm role car autosomal recessive,
non-syndromic deafness, usher syndrome type 1, based regulation,
localization, molecular interactions, car remains attractive candidate for
genetic deafness.
