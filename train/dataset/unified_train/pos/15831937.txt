a yeast two-hybrid screen using ebna3c bait revealed interaction between
this epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded nuclear protein c8 (alpha7) subunit
of human 20s proteasome. interaction confirmed glutathione
s-transferase (gst) pull-down experiments also revealed the
related proteins ebna3a ebna3b bind similarly c8/alpha7. the
interaction viral proteins gst-c8/alpha7 shown be
significantly robust previously reported interaction between
c8/alpha7 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1/cip1).
co-immunoprecipitation ebna3 proteins c8/alpha7 also demonstrated
after transfection expression vectors b cells. consistent this
ability bind directly alpha-subunit 20s proteasome, ebnas 3a, 3b 
and 3c degraded vitro purified 20s proteasomes. however,
surprisingly, sign proteasome-mediated turnover latent viral
proteins ebv-immortalized b cells could detected, even presence of
gamma interferon. actively proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines, ebnas 3a, 
3b 3c appear remarkably stable, evidence either de novo
synthesis proteasome-mediated degradation.
