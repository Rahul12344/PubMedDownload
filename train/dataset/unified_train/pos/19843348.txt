retroviruses, hepadnaviruses, retroelements vulnerable to
editing single stranded dna cytidine deaminases. eleven human genes
encoding enzymes, eight demonstrable enzymatic activity. six seven
human apobec3 able hyperedit hbv dna, frequently strands. although
human apobec1 (ha1) generally expressed normal liver, ha1 edit
single stranded dna variety experimental assays. possibility of
ectopic expression ha1 vivo cannot ruled interestingly,
transgenic mice a1 expressed liver specific promoter develop
hepatocellular carcinoma. impact ha1 hbv tissue culture varied
with reports noting either reduced dna synthesis not, cytidine
deamination taking low profile. sought examine ha1 editing activity
on replicating hbv. using highly sensitive 3dpcr possible show ha1
edits hbv minus dna strand efficiently ha3g, considered reference
deaminase hiv hbv. dinucleotide specificity editing unique
among human cytidine deaminases providing hallmark use posteriori
analyses vivo edited genomes. analysis sequences derived serum 
of two chronic carriers, indicated ha1 explained small fraction of
edited hbv genomes. contrast, several human apobec3 deaminases active
including ha3g.
