infection high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpv) lead development
of cervical carcinomas. process critically depends virus-encoded e6
and e7 oncoproteins, stimulate proliferation manipulating function
of variety host key regulatory proteins. show viral
proteins dose-dependently interfere transcriptional activity of
nf-kappab. variety experimental approaches revealed fraction the
e7 proteins found association ikappab kinase complex and
attenuates induced kinase activity ikappab kinase alpha (ikkalpha) and
ikkbeta, thus resulting impaired ikappabalpha phosphorylation degradation.
indirect immunofluorescence shows e7 impairs tnfalpha-induced nuclear
translocation nf-kappab, thus preventing nf-kappab binding cognate
dna. e7 obviates ikk activation cytoplasm, e6 protein reduces
nf-kappab p65-dependent transcriptional activity within nucleus. suggest
that hpv oncogene-mediated suppression nf-kappab activity contributes hpv
escape immune system.
