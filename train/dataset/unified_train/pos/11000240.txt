a general theme emerged studies dna tumor viruses that
otherwise unrelated oncoproteins encoded viruses often target same
important cellular factors. major oncogenic determinants human adenovirus
type 9 (ad9) high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpv) e4-orf1 e6
oncoproteins, respectively, although otherwise unrelated, viral
proteins possess functional pdz domain-binding motif essential for
their transforming activity binding pdz domain-containing and
putative tumor suppressor protein dlg. report pdz domain-binding
motifs ad9 e4-orf1 high-risk hpv-18 e6 also mediate binding widely 
expressed cellular factor mupp1, large multi-pdz domain protein predicted to
function adapter signal transduction. regard consequences of
these interactions cells, showed ad9 e4-orf1 aberrantly sequesters
mupp1 within cytoplasm cells whereas hpv-18 e6 targets cellular
protein degradation. effects specific mutant viral
proteins unable bind mupp1 lack activities. results, we
propose multi-pdz domain protein mupp1 involved negatively
regulating cellular proliferation transforming activities two
different viral oncoproteins depend, part, ability inactivate this
cellular factor.
