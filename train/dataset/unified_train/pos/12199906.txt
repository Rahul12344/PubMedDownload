background: epstein-barr virus (ebv) infects resting b-lymphocytes transforms
them immortal proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) vitro. the
transformed immunoblasts may grow immunoblastic lymphomas in
immuno-suppressed hosts.
results: order identify cellular protein targets may involved in
epstein-barr virus mediated b-cell transformation, human lcl cdna library was
screened one transformation associated nuclear antigens, ebna-3 (also
called ebna-3a), using yeast two-hybrid system. clone encoding fragment
of novel human protein isolated (clone 538). interaction confirmed 
using vitro binding assays. full-length cdna clone (f538) isolated.
sequence alignment known proteins 3d structure predictions suggest 
f538 novel human uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. the
gfp-f538 fluorescent fusion protein showed preferentially cytoplasmic
distribution translocated nucleus upon co-expression ebna-3. a
naturally occurring splice variant f538, lacks c-terminal uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase part maintain uridine kinase domain, not
translocate nucleus presence ebna3. antibody raised
against bacterially produced gst-538 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in
ebv negative burkitt lymphomas gave predominantly nuclear staining ebv
positive lcl-s stable transfected cells expressing ebna-3.
conclusion: suggest ebna-3 direct protein-protein interaction induces 
the nuclear accumulation novel enzyme, part ribonucleotide
salvage pathway. increased intranuclear levels uk/uprt may contribute the
metabolic build-up needed blast transformation rapid
proliferation.
