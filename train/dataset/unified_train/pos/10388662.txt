tax oncoprotein human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) affects multiple
regulatory processes infected cells activation repression of
specific transcription also modulation functions cell cycle
regulators. previously, found tax binds p16ink4a, member ink4
family cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, counteracts inhibitory
activity, resulting cell cycle progression. study, examined the
effects tax members ink4 family found tax bind to
p15ink4b similarly p16ink4a, p18ink4c p19ink4d. tax binding 
p15ink4b inactivated function restored cdk4 kinase activity. accordingly,
tax-expressing cells became resistant p15ink4b-mediated growth arrest induced 
by tgfbeta. hand, expression p18ink4c transcriptionally
repressed tax e-box element promoter, may contribute 
to marked reduction p18ink4c mrna htlv-1-infected t-cells. these
observations indicate tax suppresses inhibitory activities ink4
family members two independent mechanisms: functional inhibition two
ink4 proteins repression expression another ink4 protein. effects
may play roles htlv-1-induced deregulation cell cycle, possibly
promoting cellular transformation.
