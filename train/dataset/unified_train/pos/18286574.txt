human herpesvirus-6a (hhv-6a) betachemokine-receptor u51a binds inflammatory
modulators ccl2, ccl5, ccl11, ccl7, ccl13. unique specificity overlaps
that human chemokine receptors ccr1, ccr2, ccr3, ccr5. model cell
lines, expression leads ccl5 down-regulation constitutive and
inducible signaling. here, immunomodulation pathways investigated human
leukocytes permissive infection. constitutive signaling shown using
inositol phosphate assays inducible calcium signaling response ccl2,
ccl5 ccl11. constitutive signaling targets examined using immune
response-related microarray rt-pcr, showing down-regulation ccl5 and
fog-2, hematopoietic transcriptional repressor. rt-pcr sirna reversion, 
ccl5 fog-2 shown down-regulated, peak u51a expression post
infection. two active ligands, xcl1 ccl19, identified, making
u51a competitor human receptors, xcr1 ccr7, lymphocytes, nk and
dendritic cells. finally, u51a-expressing cell lines infected ex vivo
leukocytes, showed migration towards chemokine-gradients, chemokine
internalization. consequently, u51a may affect virus dissemination host
transmission chemotaxis infected cells sites chemokine secretion
specific u51a (for example lymph node lung, ccl19 ccl11,
respectively) evade immune-effector cells chemokine diversion and
down-regulation, affecting virus spread inflammatory pathology.
