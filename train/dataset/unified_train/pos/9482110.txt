infection htlv-1 correlated appearance various
proliferative degenerative diseases. disorders been
observed transgenic mice expressing tax protein, known to
transactivate various viral cellular promoters interactions with
several transcription factors. study show c-terminus 
viral oncoprotein represents motif permitting binding tax pdz domains
of several cellular proteins. two-hybrid screen tax bait indeed yielded
complementary dnas coding six proteins including pdz domains. two them
correspond truncated forms psd-95 beta1-syntrophin proteins,
another clone codes protein homologous product c. elegans
gene lin-7. three clones code new human members pdz family
of cellular proteins. interaction tax products clones
was confirmed immunoprecipitation assays mammalian cells, analysis of
various mutants tax established importance c-terminal amino acids
for several interactions. data suggest tax could perturb 
normal function targeted cellular proteins strongly interacting 
pdz domains.
