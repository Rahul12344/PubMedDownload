cell transformation simian virus 40 (sv40) results mostly highly
oncogenic activities large antigen (lt), corrupts cellular
checkpoint mechanisms guard cell division transcription,
replication, repair dna. prominent lt targets the
retinoblastoma protein (prb) p53. report lt binds directly to
fbw7, substrate recognition component scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase a
human tumor suppressor. lt binding mislocalizes nucleolar fbw7gamma isoform
to nucleoplasm. interestingly, binding lt fbw7 occurs via decoy
phospho-epitope within c terminus lt closely mimics consensus
cdc4 phospho-degron found within fbw7 substrates. demonstrate that, using this
mode interaction, lt interfere fbw7-driven cyclin e turnover vivo 
and causes increased cyclin e-associated kinase activity. data suggest that
lt competes cellular proteins fbw7 binding substrate-like fashion.
