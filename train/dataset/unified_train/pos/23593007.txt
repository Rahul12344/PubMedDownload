the nonstructural protein ns5a emerged new drug target antiviral
therapies hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. ns5a critically involved in
viral rna replication takes place newly formed membranes within the
endoplasmic reticulum (membranous web) assists viral assembly close
vicinity lipid droplets (lds). identify host proteins interact with
ns5a, performed yeast two-hybrid screen n-terminus ns5a (amino
acids 1-31), well-studied Î±-helical domain important membrane tethering
of ns5a. studies identified ld-associated host protein, tail-interacting 
protein 47 (tip47) novel ns5a interaction partner. coimmunoprecipitation
experiments huh7 hepatoma cells confirmed interaction tip47 with
full-length ns5a. shrna-mediated knockdown tip47 caused 10-fold
decrease propagation full-length infectious hcv huh7.5 hepatoma
cells. similar reduction observed tip47 knocked cells
harboring autonomously replicating hcv rna (subgenomic replicon), indicating
that tip47 required efficient hcv rna replication. single point mutation
(w9a) ns5a disrupts interaction tip47 preserves proper
subcellular localization severely decreased hcv rna replication. biochemical
membrane flotation assays, tip47 cofractionated hcv ns3, ns5a, ns5b
proteins, viral rna, together nonstructural viral proteins was
uniquely distributed lower-density ld-rich membrane fractions cells
actively replicating hcv rna. collectively, data support model where
tip47--via interaction ns5a--serves novel cofactor hcv
infection possibly integrating ld membranes membranous web.
