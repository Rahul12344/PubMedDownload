the varicella-zoster virus major transactivator, ie62, activate expression
from homologous heterologous promoters. high levels ie62-mediated
activation appear involve synergy cellular transcription factors. the
work presented focuses functional interactions ie62 the
ubiquitously expressed cellular factor usf. found usf synergize 
with ie62 similar extent model minimal promoters complex native
orf28/29 regulatory element, neither contains consensus ie62 binding
site. using gal4 fusion constructs, found activation domain of
usf1 necessary sufficient synergistic activation ie62. have
mapped regions usf ie62 required direct physical interaction.
deletion required region within ie62 ablate synergistic
activation influence efficiency depending promoter architecture. 
both proteins stabilize/increase binding tata binding protein/tfiid to
promoter elements. findings suggest novel mechanism observed
synergistic activation requires neither site-specific ie62 binding the
promoter direct physical interaction usf.
