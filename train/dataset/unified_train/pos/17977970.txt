vif(iiib), standard model viral infectivity factor of
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), binds cytidine deaminase
apobec3g (a3g) induces degradation, thereby precluding lethal
incorporation assembling virions. additionally, vif(iiib) less efficiently
degrades a3f, another potent anti-hiv-1 cytidine deaminase. although apobec3 
paralogs a3a, a3b, a3c weaker anti-hiv-1 activities only
partially degraded vif(iiib), found vif(iiib) induces emigration
from nucleus cytosol thereby causes net increases cytosolic
concentrations anti-hiv-1 activities a3a a3b. contrast, 
vifs, exemplified vif(hxb2) vif(eli-1), much efficiently degrade 
thereby neutralize apobec3s. studies focused mainly a3f imply it
occurs associated mrna-pabp1 translationally active polysomes a
lesser extent mrna processing bodies (p-bodies). a3f appears stabilize 
p-bodies associated. correspondingly small proportion of
vif(iiib) also localizes p-bodies a3f-dependent manner. stress causes
a3a, a3b, a3c, a3f colocalize efficiently vif(iiib) mrna-pabp1
complexes stress granules manner prevented cycloheximide, an
inhibitor translational elongation. coimmunoprecipitation studies suggest that
vifs different hiv-1 isolates associate tested apobec3s. thus, vifs
interact closely structurally diverse apobec3s, effects their
subcellular localization, degradation rates, antiviral activities. cytosolic 
apobec3-vif complexes predominantly bound mrnas dynamically move
between translationally active storage processing pools.
