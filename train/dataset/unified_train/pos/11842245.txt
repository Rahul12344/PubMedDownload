the adeno-associated virus type 2 (aav-2) rep proteins essential aav dna 
replication regulation aav gene expression. identified cellular 
protein interacting rep78 rep68 yeast two-hybrid analysis gst 
pull-down assays. protein recently described p53 (p53bp3)
and topoisomerase interacting protein (topors). contains an
arginine/serine-rich domain, ring finger domain five pest sequences. a
minimal sequence sufficient interaction rep mapped topors amino
acids 871 917. show region also involved the
interaction p53. rep sequences involved interaction topors were
mapped rep amino acids 172 481. overexpression topors stimulated aav
gene expression absence helper virus, suggesting function topors
as transcriptional regulator.
