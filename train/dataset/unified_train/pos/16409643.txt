background: tax oncoprotein htlv-1 deregulates signal
transduction pathways, transcription genes cell cycle regulation host
cells. transacting function tax mainly mediated protein-protein
interactions host cellular factors. tax-mediated regulation gene
expression htlv-1 cellular genes, tax shown regulate histone
acetylation physical interaction histone acetylases and
deacetylases. however, functional interaction tax histone
methyltransferases (hmtase) studied. examined ability of
tax interact histone methyltransferase suv39h1 methylates histone 
h3 lysine 9 (h3k9) represses transcription genes, studied the
functional effects interaction htlv-1 gene expression.
results: tax shown interact suv39h1 vitro, interaction 
largely dependent c-terminal half suv39h1 containing set domain.
tax affect methyltransferase activity suv39h1 tethers suv39h1
to tax containing complex nuclei. reporter gene assays, co-expression
of suv39h1 represses tax transactivation htlv-1 ltr promoter activity, which
was dependent methyltransferase activity suv39h1. furthermore, suv39h1 
expression induced along tax jpx9 cells. chromatin immunoprecipitation
(chip) analysis shows localization suv39h1 ltr tax induction, but
not absence tax induction, jpx9 transformants retaining htlv-1-luc
plasmid. immunoblotting shows higher levels suv39h1 expression htlv-1
transformed latently infected cell lines.
conclusion: study revealed first time interaction tax and
suv39h1 apparent tethering suv39h1 tax htlv-1 ltr. is
speculated tax-mediated tethering suv39h1 ltr induction the
repressive histone modification chromatin h3 k9 methylation may be
the basis dose-dependent repression tax transactivation ltr by
suv39h1. tax-induced suv39h1 expression, tax-suv39h1 interaction tethering to
the ltr may provide support idea sequence events may
form negative feedback loop self-limits htlv-1 viral gene expression in
infected cells.
