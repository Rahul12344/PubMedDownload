highly pathogenic avian influenza (hpai) viruses h5n1 subtype have

contribute efficiency viral rna synthesis disease severity.
while proteomics experiments identified number human proteins that
associate h1n1 polymerases and/or viral ribonucleoprotein (vrnp), 
host interactions might regulate influenza virus polymerase functions host

proteins tested, including rna-binding (ddx17, ddx5, npm1, hnrnpm), stress

these, dead box rna helicase ddx17/p72 facilitated efficient human-adapted (627k)

chicken ddx17 homologue required efficient avian (627e) h5n1 infection in
