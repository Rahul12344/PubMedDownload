transcription replication influenza virus rna genome occur the
nucleus viral rna-dependent rna polymerase consisting pb1, pb2,
and pa. cellular factors associate viral polymerase complex play
important roles processes. look cellular factors could
associate influenza virus pa protein, carried yeast
two-hybrid screen using hela cell cdna library. identified six cellular
proteins may interact pa. focused study one new
pa-interacting proteins, hax1, protein antiapoptotic function. using
glutathione s-transferase pulldown coimmunoprecipitation assays, we
demonstrate hax1 specifically interacts pa vitro vivo and
that hax1 interacts nuclear localization signal domain pa. nuclear
accumulation pa increased hax1-knockdown cells, phenotype
could reversed reexpression hax1, indicating hax1 impede
nuclear transport pa. consequence, knockdown hax1 resulted a
significant increase virus yield polymerase activity minigenome
assay, phenotype could reversed reexpression hax1, indicating
that hax1 inhibit influenza virus propagation. together, results 
only provide insight mechanism underlying nuclear transport pa but
also identify intrinsic host factor restricts influenza virus
infection.
