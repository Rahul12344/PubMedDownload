the herpes simplex virus ul56 gene product c-terminal-anchored, type ii
membrane protein unknown function. ul56 found interact kif1a, a
member kinesin-3 family, yeast two-hybrid screen gst pull-down 
assay. kif1a mediates transport synaptic vesicle precursors is
essential function viability neurons. overexpressed, kif1a
co-localized full-sized ul56, clear co-localization observed when
co-expressed ul56 mutant protein lacking c-terminal transmembrane
domain (tmd). although c-terminal tmd essential interaction
with kif1a yeast two-hybrid screen gst pull-down assays, results
indicate c-terminal tmd, well aa 69-217, ul56 important for
the interaction kif1a vivo. hypothesis ul56 protein affects 
vesicular trafficking infected cells, potentially acting receptor 
motor proteins neurons, discussed.
