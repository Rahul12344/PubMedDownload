we previously shown l1 major capsid protein low-risk hpv11 binds
to kap alpha2 adapter enters nucleus via kap alpha2beta1-mediated
pathway. study, discovered hpv11 l1 capsomeres bind kap beta2 
import receptor, known mediate nuclear import hnrnp a1 via interaction with
its nuclear localization signal termed m9. significantly, binding hpv11 l1
capsomeres kap beta2 inhibited nuclear import kap beta2, its
specific m9-containing cargo. interestingly, hpv11 l1 capsomeres also interacted 
with kap beta3 import receptor inhibited kap beta3 nuclear import. moreover, 
the l1 capsomeres high-risk hpv-16 shared activities. data suggest
that hpv l1 major capsid proteins interact kap beta2 kap beta3, they
may inhibit kap beta2- kap beta3-mediated nuclear import pathways 
the productive phase viral life cycle virions assembled and
released.
