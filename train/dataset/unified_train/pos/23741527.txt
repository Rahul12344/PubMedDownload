the hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein (env) gp41 plays crucial role viral
fusion process. peptides derived c-terminal heptad repeat (chr) of
gp41 potent hiv fusion inhibitors. however, activity anti-hiv-1 
peptides vivo may attenuated induction anti-gp41 antibodies.
thus, essential identify antiviral peptides proteins low, no,
immunogenicity humans. here, found c-terminal fragment (aa
462-521) human pob1 (the partner ralbp1), designated c60, hiv-1
fusion inhibitor. bound n36, peptide derived n-terminal heptad
repeat (nhr) gp41, six-helix bundle (6-hb) formed n36 c34, a
chr-peptide, bind c34. unlike chr-peptides, c60 not
block gp41 6-hb formation. rather, results suggest c60 inhibits hiv-1 fusion
by binding 6-hb, particular, residues gp41 nhr domain that
are exposed surface 6-hb. since 6-hb plays crucial role late
stage fusion viral envelope endosomal membrane the
endocytic process hiv-1, c60 may serve host restriction factor to
suppress hiv-1 entry cd4+ lymphocytes. taken together, concluded
from results c60 used lead development of
anti-hiv-1 therapeutics microbicides treatment prevention hiv-1
infection, well molecular probe study fusogenic mechanism of
hiv-1.
