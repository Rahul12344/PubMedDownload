kin17 evolutionarily conserved dna-binding protein, forms
intranuclear foci proliferating cells. recent data suggested human
kin17 protein associated cell proliferation unrepaired dna lesions.
herein, show human fibroblasts (mrc5-v2 chsv4) immortalized sv40
overexpress endogenous kin17 protein, compared normal diploid human
fibroblasts. observed certain carcinoma cell lines also up-regulated
kin17 protein, suggesting increased kin17 protein levels may a
consequence immortalized phenotype. report endogenous
kin17 protein located nucleoplasmic foci colocalizes sv40 large 
antigen. purification human kin17 protein allowed analysis physical
interaction antigen several vitro vivo assays. large t
antigen human kin17 protein part high molecular weight
multiprotein complex human cells. furthermore, human kin17 protein interacts
with antigen bound sv40 dna origin replication. strikingly, the
overexpression human kin17 protein vivo introduction increased
amounts human kin17 protein vitro assay reduced t-antigen-dependent
dna replication, suggesting kin17 protein may involved dna
replication process human cells.
