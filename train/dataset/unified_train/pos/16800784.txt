it critical viruses able avoid antiviral activities of
interferon (ifn). shown previously human papillomavirus (hpv) is
able avoid ifn-alpha via interaction hpv-16 e7 protein ifn
regulatory factor-9 (irf-9). here, investigated details interaction
using hpv-16 e7 peptide mapping show irf-9 binds hpv-16 e7 domain
encompassing amino acids 25-36. closer examination region indicates
this novel proline, glutamate, serine, threonine-rich (pest) domain,
with pest score 8.74. also mapped region interaction within
irf-9 found amino acids 354-393 play important role binding to
hpv-16 e7. region irf-9 encompasses irf association domain (iad), a
region important protein-protein interaction central irf function.
finally, used alanine-scanning mutagenesis determine e7-irf-9
interaction important e7-mediated cellular transformation found 
the hpv-16 e7 mutants y25a, e26a, s31a, s32a, e35a, l28a n29a,
caused loss transformation ability. preliminary data suggest loss irf-9
interaction e7 mutants correlated transformation. work suggests
e7-irf-9 interaction important transforming ability hpv-16 e7 and
that hpv-16 e7 may interact irf proteins iad domains.
