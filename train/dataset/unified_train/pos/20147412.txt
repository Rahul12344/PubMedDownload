control viral replication major therapeutic goal reduce morbidity 
mortality chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection. recently, methylation
has identified novel host defense mechanism, methylation viral
dna leads downregulation hbv gene expression. better understand the
mechanisms hbv methylation, cell lines exposed hbv using model
system mimics natural infection expression host dna
methyltransferase genes (dnmts) measured. dnmt1, dnmt2, dnmt3 all
significantly upregulated response hbv. dnmt3 studied because
of known role de novo methylation dna. cotransfection experiments
with full-length hbv dnmt3 led downregulation viral protein and
pregenomic rna production. investigate whether upregulation dnmts could
also effect methylation host dna, cell lines exposed to
hbv two independent model systems, one mimics natural infection a
second model temporary transfection. host dna methylation measured by
dna microarray analysis. increased methylation host cpg islands detected
in experimental systems. two cpg islands, corresponding genes sufu and
tirap, selected, downregulation genes hepatocellular
carcinomas confirmed. conclusion, hepatocytes respond hbv infection 
upregulating dnmts. dnmts methylate viral dna, leading decreased viral
gene expression decreased viral replication. however, virus-induced
overexpression dnmts also leads methylation host cpg islands.
