a class strict late herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) promoters contains a
conserved sequence element (termed downstream activation sequence, das)
located downstream transcription start site. das-containing
promoters also require tata box initiator element maximal
levels transcription. communication, demonstrate the
downstream promoter element (dpe) found class drosophila tata-less
promoters known bind homologue human taf(ii)70 (a component of
tfiid), functionally substitute das context strict late
ul38 promoter spite obvious sequence similarity. although drosophila
dpe-containing promoters require tata box, element remove
the requirement tata box functioning hsv promoter. next, we
demonstrate htaf(ii)70, interacts sequence specific manner das 
predicted fact dpe binds drosophila tbp. results suggest that
multiple tfiid/promoter interactions important activation hsv-1
late gene expression upon viral dna replication. propose such
interactions could favored upon viral dna replication since tfiid concentrates
to viral transcription foci form later stages infection.
