the core protein hepatitis c virus affects several biological functions the
host cells cellular growth apoptosis. core shown interact 
with 53bp2/bbp/aspp2, p53-binding protein, yeast two-hybrid assay. the
core competed p53 binding aspp2 vitro. apoptosis assay using 
human osteosarcoma saos-2 cells hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cells, ectopic 
expression p53 induced apoptosis aspp2 enhanced p53-induced
apoptosis. however, coexpression core p53 aspp2 increased the
number surviving cells. reporter assay, neither aspp2 core with
aspp2 affected transcriptional activity p53 promoters bax and
p21, major p53 target genes. findings suggest core inhibits
p53-mediated apoptosis blocking interaction p53 aspp2, without
modulating transcriptional activity p53, plays role oncogenesis
of hepatocellular carcinoma.
