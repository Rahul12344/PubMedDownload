human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hgbp1) interferon-inducible protein
involved host immune response viral infection. response to
infection influenza virus (iav), hgbp1 transcript protein were
significantly upregulated. overexpression hgbp1 inhibited iav replication a
dose-dependent manner vitro. lysine residue position 51 (k51) hgbp1 
was essential inhibition iav replication. mutation k51 resulted an
hgbp1 unable inhibit iav replication. viral nonstructural protein
1 (ns1) found interact directly hgbp1. k51 hgbp1 region
between residues 123 144 ns1 demonstrated essential the
interaction ns1 hgbp1. binding ns1 hgbp1 resulted a
significant reduction gtpase activity anti-iav activity hgbp1.
these findings indicated hgbp1 contributed host immune response
against iav replication hgbp1-mediated antiviral activity was
antagonized ns1 via binding hgbp1.
