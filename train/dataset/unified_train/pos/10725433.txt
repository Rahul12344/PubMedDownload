the programme epstein-barr virus (ebv) gene expression leads to
virus-induced growth transformation resting b lymphocytes initiated through
activation bamhi w promoter, wp. factors regulating wp, basis 
of preferential activity b cells, remain poorly understood. previous work 
has identified b cell-specific enhancer region critical wp
function contains three binding sites cellular factors. we
focus one sites show, using bandshift assays, interacts
with three members creb/atf family cell transcription factors, creb1,
atf1 atfa. mutation abrogates binding factors reduces wp
reporter activity specifically b cell lines, whereas mutation converts
the site consensus creb-binding sequence maintains wild-type promoter
function. furthermore wp activity b cell, non-b cell, lines could
be inhibited cotransfection expression plasmids expressing dominant
negative forms creb1 atf1. increasing basal activity creb/atf
proteins cells treatment protein kinase protein kinase c agonists
led small increases wp activity b cell lines, restore
promoter activity non-b cell lines b cell levels. conclude that
creb/atf factors important activators wp b cell environment but
require additional b cell-specific factors order mediate effects.
