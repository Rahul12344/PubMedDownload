rna helicases play important roles rna metabolism. human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (hiv-1) carry rna helicase, virus thus needs to
exploit cellular rna helicases promote replication rna various
steps transcription, folding transport. study, report that
knockdown dead-box protein named ddx24 inhibits packaging hiv-1 rna
and thus diminishes viral infectivity. decreased viral rna packaging a
result ddx24-knockdown observed context rev/rre (rev
response element)-dependent cte (constitutive transport
element)-mediated nuclear export viral rna, explained specific
interaction ddx24 rev protein. propose ddx24 acts the
early phase hiv-1 rna metabolism prior nuclear export consequence
of action extends viral rna packaging stage virus assembly.
