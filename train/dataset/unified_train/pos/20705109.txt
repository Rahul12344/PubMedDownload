antimicrobial peptides activity wide variety biological
membranes important component innate immunity vertebrate well
as invertebrate systems. mechanisms action peptides are
incompletely understood number competing necessarily mutually
exclusive models exist. study examined virucidal activity four 
peptides, human cathelicidin derived ll37, xenopus alanine-substituted
magainin-2 amide, uperin-3.1, cecropin-ll37 hybrid vaccinia virus. 
the peptides shown differentially virucidal shown to
attack viral envelope, ll37 effective uperin-3.1 
least. density gradient analysis treated virions indicated virus outer
membrane efficiently removed peptide action suggests mechanism of
direct virus inactivation consistent carpet model for
peptide-mediated membrane disruption. interestingly, least effective peptide 
uperin-3.1 equally effective others inducing susceptibility to
neutralizing antibody. suggests addition direct killing a
carpet-based mechanism, peptides may simultaneously operate different
mechanism exposes sequestered antigen without membrane removal.
