infection cells highly anemogenic feline leukemia virus subgroup c
(felv-c) mediated heme exporter flvcr1, cell surface protein
containing 12 potential transmembrane segments six presumptive extracellular
loops (ecls). identify flvcr1 residues critical mediating felv-c
infection, first independently isolated human cdna encoding flvcr2
protein shares 52% identity human flvcr1, show flvcr2 does
not function receptor felv-c. then, generating specific hybrids
between flvcr1 flvcr2 testing susceptibility mouse cells expressing
these hybrids beta-galactosidase encoding felv-c, identify flvcr1 ecls 1
and 6 critical mediating felv-c infection. mouse cells expressing hybrid
protein containing flvcr2 backbone ecl6 sequence flvcr1 highly
susceptible felv-c infection. using site-directed mutagenesis, show 
single mutation asn463 flvcr2 ecl6 acidic asp residue (a residue
present corresponding position 487 flvcr1 ecl6) sufficient render
flvcr2 functional felv-c receptor. however, asp487asn mutation flvcr1
ecl6 substitution entire flvcr1 ecl6 sequence flvcr2 ecl6 sequence 
does disrupt receptor function. subsequent substitutions show residues
within flvcr1 ecl1 also contribute mediating felv-c infection. furthermore,
our results suggest flvcr1 regions mediate felv-c surface unit binding 
are distinct ecl1 ecl6. results consistent previous
conclusions infection cells gammaretroviruses involves interaction 
virus multiple receptor regions.
