the steady-state level metabolic half-life retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
protein prb decreased cells express high-risk human papillomavirus
(hpv) e7 proteins. show prb degradation direct activity e7
and reflect property cell lines acquired selection
process e7 expression. amino-terminal domain e7 directly 
contribute prb binding required transformation also necessary
for e7-mediated prb degradation. treatment inhibitors 26s proteasome 
not blocks e7-mediated prb degradation also causes stabilization 
e7. mutagenic analyses, however, reveal processes proteasomal
degradation e7 prb linked processes. hpv type 16 e7 also targets
the prb-related proteins p107 p130 destabilization a
proteasome-dependent mechanism. using saos2 flat-cell assay biological
indicator prb function, demonstrate prb degradation, solely
binding, important e7-induced inactivation prb.
