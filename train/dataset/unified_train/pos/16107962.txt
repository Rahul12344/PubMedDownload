the binding norwalk virus (nv) recombinant capsids tested panel of
saliva samples collected 96 donors different abo, secretor, lewis
phenotypes. previously reported, binding occurred specifically saliva 
secretors, regardless lewis phenotype status. blood group b saliva was
poorly recognized, whereas binding blood group saliva higher binding
to blood group saliva highest. transfection either blood group b
enzyme h epitope-expressing cells showed masking h epitopes a
and b antigens blocked attachment nv capsids. high level binding to
blood group secretor saliva could explained optimal h type 1 ligand
density, lower blood group saliva much higher than
that blood group b saliva. indeed, despite higher ligand density, saliva
from homozygotes 2 functional fut2 alleles less strongly recognized than
saliva heterozygotes 1 functional 1 inactivated fut2 allele.
partial fucosidase treatment duodenal tissue sections binding a
synthetic probe varying densities h type 1 trisaccharide indicated that
optimal attachment occurred medium ligand density.
