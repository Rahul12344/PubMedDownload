background & aims: cyclophilin (cypa) vital hcv replication. cyp
inhibitors successfully decrease viral loads hcv-infected patients. however,
their mechanisms action remain unknown. since interferon (ifn) also
suppress hcv replication, asked whether link cypa ifn
response exists.
methods: used cellular recombinant pulldown approaches investigate 
possibility specific association cypa host ligands.
results: found first time cypa binds major component 
ifn response - ifn regulatory factor 9 (irf9). irf9 dna-binding
component transcriptional ifn-stimulated gene factor 3 (isgf3). cypa binds
directly irf9 via peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (ppiase) pocket. cyp
inhibitors cyclosporine (csa) non-immunosuppressive derivates such
as alisporivir scy-635, prevent irf9-cypa complex formation. cypa binds to
the c-terminal irf-association-domain (iad), dna-binding linker
domains irf9. remarkably, cypa associates multimeric isgf3 complex.
we also obtained evidence cypa neutralization enhances ifn-induced
transcription. interestingly, hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural 5a
(ns5a) protein, known modulate ifn response, competes irf9
for cypa binding prevent formation irf9-cypa complexes.
conclusions: study demonstrates first time cypa binds
specifically component janus kinase/signal transducer activator
of transcription (jak/stat) pathway, irf9. study also reveals novel
opportunity hcv modulate ifn response via ns5a.
