human cells respond infection retroviruses actions proteins 
that inhibit spread viruses cells. one example bone marrow
stromal cell antigen 2 (bst2; also known tetherin), interferon
(ifn)-inducible protein restricts release progeny virions from
infected cells. hiv-1 accessory protein vpu (viral protein u) causes
degradation bst2, phosphorylation vpu residues ser(52) ser(56)
is required function. report host protein scy1-like protein 
2 (scyl2) mediates dephosphorylation vpu, antagonizing vpu function and
facilitating bst2-dependent restriction hiv-1 release. scyl2 reduced the
number virus particles released cells infected wild-type hiv-1, 
not strain lacking vpu, bst2-dependent manner. scyl2 stimulated the
dephosphorylation vpu ser(52) ser(56) recruiting protein phosphatase
2a (pp2a) vpu. conversely, depletion scyl2 resulted enhanced
phosphorylation vpu increased viral particle release. moreover, scyl2 
produced response type ifn contributed ifn-mediated viral
restriction. together, results suggest scyl2 serves regulatory
factor vpu, reducing extent vpu phosphorylation consequently
enhancing bst2-mediated viral restriction.
