tank-binding kinase 1 (tbk1) key component toll-like receptor-dependent
and -independent signaling pathways. response microbial components, tbk1
activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (irf3) cytokine expression. 
show tbk1 novel target gamma(1)34.5 protein, virulence factor 
whose expression regulated temporal fashion. remarkably, gamma(1)34.5
protein required inhibit irf3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and
the induction antiviral genes infected cells. expressed mammalian
cells, gamma(1)34.5 protein forms complexes tbk1 disrupts the
interaction tbk1 irf3, prevents induction interferon and
interferon-stimulated gene promoters. down-regulation tbk1 requires the
amino-terminal domain. addition, unlike wild type virus, herpes simplex
virus mutant lacking gamma(1)34.5 replicates efficiently tbk1(-/-) cells but
not tbk1(+/+) cells. addition exogenous interferon restores antiviral
activity tbk1(-/-) tbk(+/+) cells. hence, control tbk1-mediated
cell signaling gamma(1)34.5 protein contributes herpes simplex virus
infection. results reveal tbk1 plays pivotal role limiting
replication dna virus.
