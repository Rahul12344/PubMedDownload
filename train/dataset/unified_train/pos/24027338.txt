alphaherpesvirinae family members reactivate latency following stress.
the synthetic corticosteroid dexamethasone induces certain cellular transcription
factors murine bovine trigeminal ganglionic neurons. three
dexamethasone-induced transcription factors, kr√ºppel-like factor 15, slug, and
spdef, stimulated herpes simplex virus type 1-infected cell protein 0 (icp0) 
promoter 150-fold. conversely, viral promoters (vp16 icp4)
were strongly stimulated, suggesting icp0 promoter preferentially
activated dexamethasone-simulated stress.
