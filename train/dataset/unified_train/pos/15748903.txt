novel binding sites forkhead transcription factor family member forkhead 
box (foxa), previously referred hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (hnf3), 
found within mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (mmtv ltr). the
effect foxa1 mmtv ltr chromatin structure, expression evaluated 
xenopus laevis oocytes. mutagenesis either two main foxa binding sites 
showed distal site, -232/-221, conferred foxa1-dependent partial
inhibition glucocorticoid receptor (gr) driven mmtv transcription. the
proximal foxa binding segment consisted two individual foxa sites -57/-46
and -45/-34, respectively, mediated increased basal mmtv transcription.
foxa1 binding altered chromatin structure inactive- the
hormone-activated mmtv ltr. hydroxyl radical foot printing revealed
foxa1-mediated changes nucleosome arrangement. micrococcal nuclease
digestion showed hormone-dependent sub-nucleosome complex, containing
approximately 120 bp dna, expanded foxa1 binding proximal
segment larger complex containing approximately 200 bp. potential
function foxa1-mediated expression mmtv provirus maintenance of
expression different tissues discussed.
