hepatitis c virus (hcv)-related research hampered lack of
appropriate small-animal models. reported tree shrews, or
tupaias (tupaia belangeri), infected serum-derived hcv. however,
these reports firmly establish tupaia reliable model hcv
infection. human cd81, scavenger receptor class b type (sr-bi), claudin 1
(cldn1), occludin (ocln) considered essential receptors coreceptors
for hcv cell entry. present study, roles tupaia orthologs 
hcv infection assessed. cd81 sr-bi tupaia found able 
to bind hcv envelope protein 2 (e2). comparison human cd81, tupaia
cd81 exhibited stronger binding activity e2 increased hcv pseudoparticle
(hcvpp) cell entry 2-fold. 293t cells transfected tupaia cldn1 became
susceptible hcvpp infection. moreover, simultaneous transfection four
tupaia factors mouse nih 3t3 cells made cells susceptible hcvpp
infection. hcvpp diverse genotypes able infect primary tupaia
hepatocytes (pths), infection could blocked either anti-cd81 or
anti-sr-bi. pths could infected cell culture-produced hcv (hcvcc) did
produce infectious progeny virus culture supernatant. findings indicate 
that pths possess essential factors required hcv entry support
the complete hcv infection cycle. highlights mechanisms of
susceptibility tupaia hcv infection possibility using tupaia 
a promising small-animal model hcv study.
