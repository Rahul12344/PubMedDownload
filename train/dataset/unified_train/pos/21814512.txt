the htrex complex mediates cellular bulk mrna nuclear export recruiting the
nuclear export factor, tap, via direct interaction export adaptor,
aly. intriguingly however, depletion aly leads modest reduction in
cellular mrna nuclear export, suggesting existence additional mrna nuclear
export adaptor proteins. order efficiently export kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) intronless mrnas nucleus, kshv
orf57 protein recruits htrex onto viral intronless mrnas allowing access the
tap-mediated export pathway. similarly however, depletion aly leads 
modest reduction nuclear export kshv intronless mrnas. herein, we
identify novel interaction orf57 cellular protein, uif. we
provide first evidence orf57-uif interaction enables recruitment
of htrex tap kshv intronless mrnas aly-depleted cells. strikingly,
depletion aly uif inhibits formation orf57-mediated nuclear
export competent ribonucleoprotein particle consequently prevents
orf57-mediated mrna nuclear export kshv protein production. importantly,
these findings highlight redundancy exists eukaryotic system for
certain htrex components involved mrna nuclear export intronless kshv
mrnas.
