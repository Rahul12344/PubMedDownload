type b leukemogenic virus (tblv) induces rapidly appearing t-cell tumors mice.
tblv highly related mouse mammary tumor virus (mmtv) except tblv long 
terminal repeats (ltrs) deletion negative regulatory elements a
triplication sequences flanking deletion. determine ltr
triplication represents viral enhancer element, inserted triplication
upstream downstream either orientation relative thymidine kinase
promoter linked luciferase gene. experiments showed that
upregulation reporter gene activity tblv triplication relatively
orientation independent, consistent activity eukaryotic enhancer
elements. tblv enhancer activity observed t-cell lines in
fibroblasts, b cells, mammary cells, suggesting enhancer function cell
type dependent. analyze transcription factor binding sites are
important tblv enhancer function, prepared substitution mutations a
reconstituted c3h mmtv ltr recapitulates deletion observed tblv
ltr. transient transfections showed single mutation (556m) decreased tblv 
enhancer activity least 20-fold two different t-cell lines. mutation
greatly diminished aml-1 (recently renamed runx1) binding gel shift assays
with mutant oligonucleotide, whereas aml-1 binding wild-type tblv oligomer
was specific, judged competition supershift experiments. 556
mutation also reduced tblv enhancer binding two protein complexes,
called nf-a nf-b, appear related c-myb ets. aml-1
overexpression mammary cell line enhanced expression tblv ltr
approximately 30-fold. data suggest binding aml-1 tblv
enhancer, likely combination factors, necessary optimal
enhancer function.
