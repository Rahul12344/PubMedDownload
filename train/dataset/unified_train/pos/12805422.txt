the rev protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) essential for
the nucleocytoplasmic transport unspliced partially spliced hiv mrnas
containing rev response element (rre). yeast two-hybrid screen hela
cell-derived cdna expression library human factors interacting rev
leucine-rich nuclear export sequence (nes), identified kinesin-like protein,
rebp (rev/rex effector binding protein), highly homologous kid, the
carboxy-terminal 75-residue region interacts specifically ness 
of hiv-1 rev, human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 rex, equine infectious
anemia virus rev functionally inactive mutants thereof. rebp a
nuclear protein colocalizes rev nucleoplasm nuclear
periphery transfected cells. specific, albeit weak, interaction rebp
and rev could demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation assays bsc-40 cells.
rebp modestly enhance rev-dependent rre-linked reporter gene expression 
independently cooperation nucleoporin cofactor rab/hrip. thus,
rebp displays characteristics expected authentic mediator rev nes
function may play role rre rna transport hiv infection.
