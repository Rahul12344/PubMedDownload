human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) nef protein causes loss cell
surface cd4 interleukin-2 (il-2) receptor (tac) peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (pbmc) cd4+ t-cell lines. cd4 il-2 receptor
play crucial roles antigen-driven helper t-cell signalling t-cell
proliferation, respectively, role nef viral life cycle may to
perturb signalling pathways emanating receptors. however, the
intracellular targets nef result receptor down-regulation are
unknown. using recombinant glutathione s-transferase-full-length 27 kda nef
(nef27) fusion protein, produced escherichia coli translation the
first start codon hiv-1 nef clone pnl4-3, affinity reagent probe
cytoplasmic extracts mt-2 cells pbmc, shown interaction at
least seven host cell protein species ranging 24 75 kda. immunoblotting
identified four proteins p56lck, cd4, p53, p44mapk/erk1, of
which intimately involved intracellular signalling. assess the
relevance interactions define biochemical activity of
nef signal transduction pathways, highly purified nef27 protein introduced
directly pbmc electroporation. nef27-treated pbmc showed reduced
proliferative responsiveness exogenous recombinant il-2. normally, stimulation
of t-cells il-2 phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate provokes augmentation 
of p56lck activity corresponding posttranslational modification p56lck.
these changes also inhibited treatment pbmc nef, suggesting 
nef interferes activation p56lck consequence signalling via
the il-2 receptor. evidence nef interfering cell proliferation
