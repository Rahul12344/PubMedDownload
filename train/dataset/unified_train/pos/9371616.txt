the nef highly virulent strain simian immunodeficiency virus (siv),
sivpbj14, nef traditional strain sivmac239 bearing mutation
from rq ye (ye-nef) induce acute lethal disease monkeys. ye
mutation surrounding sequence resemble immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
activation motif (itam), present cytoplasmic tail t- and
b-cell antigen receptors mediates signaling lymphocyte activation. 
show itam ye-nef performs function. first, only
does ye-nef increase activity transcription factor nfat, one 
of downstream targets t-cell activation, itam ye-nef by
itself also activates nfat. second, itam ye-nef phosphorylated on
tyrosine residues lck associates zap-70, t-cell-specific tyrosine
kinase. phosphorylation conserved tyrosine residues itam is
required recruitment zap-70. finally, lck required the
activation nfat ye-nef. results demonstrate ye-nef contains a
functional itam elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis sivpbj14.
