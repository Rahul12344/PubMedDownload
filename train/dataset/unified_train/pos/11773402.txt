the hepatitis c virus (hcv) envelope protein e2 shown accumulate in
the lumen endoplasmic reticulum (er) properly folded glycoprotein 
well large aggregates misfolded proteins. present study, have
identified additional unglycosylated species, apparent molecular mass 
of 38 kda (e2-p38). contrast glycosylated e2, e2-p38 significantly
less stable degraded proteasome pathway. correspondingly,
e2-p38 found ubiquitinated. e2-p38 localized mostly cytosol,
in contrast glycosylated form, exclusively membrane associated.
alpha interferon (ifn-alpha) treatment overexpression double-stranded
rna-activated protein kinase (pkr) significantly increased stability of
e2-p38, consistent previous report (d. r. taylor, s. t. shi, p. r. romano,
g. n. barber, m. m. lai, science 285:107-110, 1999) e2 interacts with
pkr inhibits kinase activity. direct interaction pkr e2-p38, 
but glycosylated form e2, also observed. results show that
e2-p38 form e2 interacts pkr cytosol may
contribute resistance hcv ifn-alpha. thus, er protein exist
in cytosol unglycosylated species impair cellular functions.
