granzyme (grm) highly expressed cytotoxic granules nk cells, which
provide first line defense viral pathogens. grm knockout mice show
increased susceptibility toward murine cmv infection. although grm potent
inducer cell death, mechanism grm eliminates viruses remains
elusive. paper, show purified human grm combination the
perforin-analog streptolysin (slo) strongly inhibited human cmv (hcmv)
replication fibroblasts absence host cell death. proteomic
approach, grm highly specific toward hcmv proteome efficiently
cleaved phosphoprotein 71 (pp71), hcmv tegument protein critical for
viral replication. cleavage pp71 occurred viral lysates incubated
with purified grm, intact cells expressing recombinant pp71 challenged 
with living cytotoxic effector cells, hcmv-infected fibroblasts were
incubated slo purified grm. grm directly cleaved pp71 leu(439),
which coincided aberrant cellular localization pp71 cleavage
fragments determined confocal immunofluorescence. luciferase reporter 
assay, cleavage pp71 leu(439) grm completely abolished ability of
pp71 transactivate hcmv major immediate-early promoter, is
indispensable effective hcmv replication. finally, grm decreased
immediate-early 1 protein expression hcmv-infected fibroblasts. results 
indicate nk cell protease grm mediates cell death-independent antiviral 
activity direct cleavage viral substrate.
