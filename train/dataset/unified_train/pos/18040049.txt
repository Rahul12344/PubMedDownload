dendritic cells (dcs) efficiently capture hiv-1 mediate transmission t
cells, underlying molecular mechanism still debated. c-type 
lectin dc-sign important hiv-1 transmission dcs. however, various
studies strongly suggest another hiv-1 receptor dcs involved the
capture hiv-1. identified syndecan-3 major hiv-1 attachment 
receptor dcs. syndecan-3 dc-specific heparan sulfate (hs) proteoglycan
that captures hiv-1 interaction hiv-1 envelope glycoprotein
gp120. syndecan-3 stabilizes captured virus, enhances dc infection cis,
and promotes transmission cells. removal hss cell surface by
heparinase iii silencing syndecan-3 sirna partially inhibited hiv-1
transmission immature dcs, whereas neutralizing syndecan-3 dc-sign
completely abrogated hiv-1 capture subsequent transmission. thus, hiv-1
exploits syndecan-3 dc-sign mediate hiv-1 transmission, an
effective microbicide target syndecan-3 dc-sign dcs prevent
transmission.
