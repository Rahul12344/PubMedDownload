background: interferon (ifn)-induced, dsrna-dependent serine/threonine
protein kinase, pkr, plays key regulatory role ifn-mediated anti-viral
response blocking translation infected cell phosphorylating the
alpha subunit elongation factor 2 (eif2). human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) evades anti-viral ifn response binding one of
its major transcriptional regulatory proteins, tat, pkr. hiv-1 tat acts a
substrate homologue enzyme, competing eif2alpha, inhibiting 
translational block. shown interaction pkr, tat 
becomes phosphorylated three residues: serine 62, threonine 64 serine 68. 
we investigated effect phosphorylation function tat in
viral transcription. hiv-1 tat activates transcription elongation first
binding tar rna, stem-loop structure found 5' end viral
transcripts. results showed faster, greater stronger binding tat to
tar rna phosphorylation pkr.
results: investigated effect phosphorylation tat-mediated
transactivation. results showed faster, greater stronger binding tat
to tar rna phosphorylation pkr. vitro phosphorylation experiments
with series bacterial expression constructs carrying wild-type tat gene 
or mutants gene alanine substitutions one, two, three of
the serine/threonine pkr phosphorylation sites, showed subject to
different levels phosphorylation pkr displayed distinct kinetic
behaviour. results also suggested cooperative role the
phosphorylation s68 conjunction s62 t64. examined effect of
phosphorylation tat-mediated transactivation hiv-1 ltr vivo a
series analogous mammalian expression constructs. co-transfection experiments 
showed gradual reduction transactivation number mutated
phosphorylation sites increased, 4-fold decrease ltr transactivation
with tat triple mutant could phosphorylated pkr. furthermore, 
the transfection data also suggested presence s68 necessary for
optimal tat-mediated transactivation.
conclusion: results support hypothesis phosphorylation tat may 
be important function hiv-1 ltr transactivation.
