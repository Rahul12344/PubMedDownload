the viral genome kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) persists an
extrachromosomal plasmid latently infected cells. kshv latency-associated 
nuclear antigen (lana) stimulates plasmid maintenance dna replication by
binding approximately 150-bp region within viral terminal repeats (tr).
we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate lana binds 
specifically replication origin sequence within kshv tr latently
infected cells. latent replication origin within tr also bound by
lana-associated proteins cbp, double-bromodomain-containing protein 2 (brd2), and
the origin recognition complex 2 protein (orc2) enriched in
hyperacetylated histones h3 h4 relative regions latent
genome. cell cycle analysis indicated minichromosome maintenance complex
protein, mcm3, bound tr late-g(1)/s-arrested cells, coincided the
loss histone h3 k4 methylation. micrococcal nuclease studies revealed trs
are embedded highly ordered nucleosome array becomes disorganized in
late g(1)/s phase. orc binding tr lana dependent reconstituted in
transfected plasmids. dna affinity purification confirmed lana, cbp, brd2,
and orc2 bound tr specifically identified histone acetyltransferase hbo1 
(histone acetyltransferase binding orc1) potential tr binding protein.
disruption orc2, mcm5, hbo1 expression small interfering rna reduced
lana-dependent dna replication tr-containing plasmids. findings 
first demonstration cellular replication origin licensing factors are
required kshv latent cycle replication. results also suggest the
kshv latent origin replication unique chromatin environment containing
histone h3 hyperacetylation within heterochromatic tandem repeats.
