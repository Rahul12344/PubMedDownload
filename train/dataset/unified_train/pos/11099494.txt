the x protein chronic strain hepatitis b virus (hbx) determined 
inhibit fas-mediated apoptosis promote cell survival. fas-mediated apoptosis 
is major cause hepatocyte damage liver disease. experiments
demonstrated cell death caused anti-fas antibodies blocked the
expression hbx human primary hepatocytes mouse embryo fibroblasts. this
effect also observed mouse erythroleukemia cells lacked p53,
indicating protection fas-mediated apoptosis independent p53.
components signal transduction pathways involved protection were
studied. sapk/jnk pathway previously suggested survival
pathway cells undergoing fas-mediated apoptosis, kinase assays
showed sapk activity highly up-regulated cells expressing hbx
protein. normal mouse fibroblasts expressing hbx protected death,
whereas identical fibroblasts lacking sek1 component sapk pathway
succumbed fas-mediated apoptosis, whether hbx present not. assays
showed caspase 3 8 activities release cytochrome c from
mitochondria inhibited, presence hbx, following stimulation with
anti-fas antibodies. coprecipitation confocal immunofluorescence microscopy
experiments demonstrated hbx localizes cytoplasmic complex containing
mekk1, sek1, sapk, 14-3-3 proteins. finally, mutational analysis hbx
demonstrated potential binding region 14-3-3 proteins essential
for induction sapk/jnk activity protection fas-mediated apoptosis.
