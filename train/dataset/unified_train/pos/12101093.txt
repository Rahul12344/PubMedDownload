the rna-dependent protein kinase (pkr) interferon-induced, rna-activated
enzyme phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha, rendering the
translation machinery inactive. viruses developed strategies preventing 
the action pkr, one production small rnas inhibit 
enzyme. epstein-barr virus (ebv) encodes eber1, 167 nucleotide non-coding rna
that constitutively expressed ebv-infected cells. eber1 binds pkr in
vitro shown prevent inhibition translation pkr vitro. we
used affinity cleavage edta.fe-modified double-stranded rna-binding domain
(dsrbd) pkr show stem-loop iv (nucleotides 87-123) eber1 makes
specific contacts dsrbd. demonstrate specificity 
interaction, generated deletion mutant eber1, comprising stem-loop
iv (meber1). cleavage patterns produced meber1 bound dsrbd were
remarkably similar found full-length eber1. using cleavage data 
two different dsrbd mutants, present model interaction pkr dsrbd
and meber1.
