sexual transmission hiv-1 requires virus adsorption target cell,
typically cd4(+) lymphocyte residing lamina propria, beneath the
epithelium. escape mucosal clearance system reach target cells,
hiv-1 evolved strategies circumvent deleterious host factors. galectin-1, 
a soluble lectin found underlayers epithelium, increases hiv-1
infectivity accelerating binding susceptible cells. comparison,
galectin-3, family member expressed epithelial cells part mucosal
clearance system, perform similarly. show galectin-1
directly binds hiv-1 Î²-galactoside-dependent fashion recognition 
of clusters n-linked glycans viral envelope gp120. unexpectedly, this
preferential binding galectin-1 rely primary sequence any
particular glycans. instead, glycan clustering arising tertiary
structure gp120 hinders binding galectin-3. increased polyvalency 
specific ligand epitope common strategy glycans increase their
avidity lectins. peculiar occurrence, glycan clustering instead
exploited prevent binding gp120 galectin-3, would lead a
biological dead-end virus. data also suggest galectin-1 binds
preferentially cd4, host receptor gp120. together, results
suggest hiv-1 exploits galectin-1 enhance gp120-cd4 interactions, thereby
promoting virus attachment infection events. since viral adhesion a
rate-limiting step hiv-1 entry, modulation gp120 interaction with
galectin-1 could thus represent novel approach prevention hiv-1
transmission.
