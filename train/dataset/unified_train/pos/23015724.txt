mx1 gtpase part antiviral response induced type type
iii interferons infected host. inhibits influenza virus infection by
blocking viral transcription replication, molecular mechanism 
known. polymerase basic protein 2 (pb2) nucleoprotein (np) suggested 
be possible target mx1, direct interaction mx1 of
the viral proteins reported. investigated interplay between
mx1, np, pb2 identify mechanism mx1's antiviral activity. found 
that mx1 inhibits pb2-np interaction, strength inhibition
correlated decrease viral polymerase activity. inhibition pb2-np
interaction active process requiring enzymatically active mx1. also
demonstrate mx1 interacts viral proteins np pb2, which
indicates mx1 protein direct effect viral ribonucleoprotein
complex. minireplicon system, avian-like np swine virus isolates was
more sensitive inhibition murine mx1 np human influenza virus
isolates. likewise, murine mx1 displaced avian np viral
ribonucleoprotein complex easily human np. stronger resistance of
the a/h1n1 pandemic 2009 virus mx1 also correlated reduced
inhibition pb2-np interaction. findings support model mx1
interacts influenza ribonucleoprotein complex interferes its
assembly disturbing pb2-np interaction.
