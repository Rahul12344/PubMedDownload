simian virus 40 large antigen (tag) viral oncoprotein promote
cellular transformation. tag's transforming activity results part binding
and inactivating key tumor suppressors, including p53 retinoblastoma
protein (prb). identified tag-associated 185-kda protein has
significant homology cullin family e3 ubiquitin ligases. tag binds to
an scf-like complex contains p185/cul7, rbx1, f box protein fbw6.
this scf-like complex binds n-terminal region tag. several
p185/cul7-binding-deficient mutants tag generated retained binding
to prb p53 capable overcoming rb-mediated repression e2f
transcription. despite binding prb p53, p185/cul7-binding-defective 
mutants tag unable transform primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. cells
expressing p185/cul7-binding-defective mutants tag unable grow high
density grow anchorage-independent manner determined growth in
soft agar. considering significance tag-interacting proteins in
regulation cell cycle, p185/cul7 may also regulate important growth
control pathway.
