distinct subsets human receptors alphaherpesviruses mediate entry of
herpes simplex virus (hsv), pseudorabies virus (prv), bovine herpes virus type
1 (bhv-1) cells. glycoprotein (gd) essential receptor-mediated
entry three viruses cells. however, gd homologs viruses 
share 22-33% amino acid identity. several entry receptors hsv 
identified. two these, hvea (hvem) hvec (nectin-1), mediate entry 
hsv-1 hsv-2 strains bound directly hsv gd. third receptor, hveb 
(nectin-2), mediates entry hsv-2 limited number hsv-1 strains.
hveb hvec also serve entry receptors prv, whereas hvec can
serve function bhv-1. show gd prv bhv-1 binds
directly human receptors mediate prv bhv-1 entry. expressed
soluble forms prv gd bhv-1 gd using recombinant baculoviruses purified
each protein. using elisa, detected direct binding prv gd hveb hvec 
and direct binding bhv-1 gd hvec. biosensor analysis revealed prv gd
had 10-fold higher affinity hsv-1 gd human hvec. contrast, the
binding bhv-1 gd hvec weak. prv gd hsv-1 gd competed binding to
the v domain hvec inhibited entry homologous heterologous 
viruses. data suggest two forms gd bind common region on
human hvec despite low amino acid similarity. based affinities human
hvec, predict porcine hvec homolog may important prv infection its
natural host, whereas bhv-1 infection natural host may mediated 
receptor bovine hvec homolog.
