natural killer (nk) cells innate cytotoxic lymphocytes specialize the
defense viral infection oncogenic transformation. action is
tightly regulated signals derived inhibitory activating receptors;
the later include proteins natural cytotoxicity receptors (ncrs:
nkp46, nkp44 nkp30). among ncrs, nkp46 receptor a
mouse orthologue named ncr1. nkp46/ncr1 also unique marker expressed nk
and lymphoid tissue inducer (lti) cells implicated control
of various viral infections, cancer diabetes. previously shown that
human nkp46 recognizes viral hemagglutinin (ha) sialic acid-dependent manner
and o-glycosylation essential nkp46 binding viral ha. here
we studied molecular interactions ncr1 influenza viruses. show
that ncr1 recognizes influenza virus sialic acid dependent manner that
n-glycosylation important binding. surprisingly demonstrate that
none predicted n-glycosilated residues ncr1 essential its
binding influenza virus thus conclude other, yet unidentified
n-glycosilated residues responsible recognition. demonstrated
that n glycosylation play little role recognition mouse tumor cell
lines also showed in-vivo importance ncr1 control influenza 
virus infection infecting c57bl/6 balb/c mice knockout ncr1 with
influenza.
