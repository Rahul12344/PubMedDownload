the n-terminal region adenovirus (ad) 12s e1a gene product targets several
cellular proteins essential induction phase, cellular
immortalization, cellular transformation, transcriptional repression, and
transcriptional activation. precise binding sites proteins,
however, remain resolved. therefore undertook extensive site-directed
mutagenesis approach generate specific point mutants precisely map 
binding sites cbp, p300, tata-binding protein (tbp), s4, s8, hgcn5, p/caf,
and ran within first 30 amino acids ad5 12s e1a protein. determined
that although common residues within n-terminal region form partial
binding sites proteins, point mutants also generated could
discriminate binding sites. data indicate ade1a target
each proteins individually distinct binding sites. was
evident, however, mutation specific hydrophobic residues typically
had greatest effect upon ade1a's ability bind individual partners. indeed,
the mutation l positions 19 20 eliminated ability ade1a to
interact n-terminal binding proteins studied here. interestingly,
although tbp s8 cbp/p300 exist functional complexes, rna
interference revealed recruitment either tbp, s8, cbp/p300 to
ade1a dependent upon expression proteins. data
further indicate ade1a target individual partner proteins vivo and
that necessarily recruit proteins indirectly components of
larger macromolecular complexes. finally, took advantage fine-mapping
data ascertain proteins targeted transformation process.
consistent previous studies, cbp/p300 found targeted ade1a
during process, although data suggest binding n-terminal
proteins also important transformation.
