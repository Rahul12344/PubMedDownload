newcastle disease virus (ndv) causes heavy economic losses poultry industry
across globe every year. although ndv matrix (m) protein involved virus
budding previous data indicate ovo expression protein
facilitates ndv replication, underlying mechanism role protein
in ndv replication clear. using yeast two-hybrid system and
immunoprecipitation approaches, found protein interacted host
vacuolar sorting protein charged multivesicular body protein (chmp) 4b 4c. in
addition, colocalization protein chmp4b/c could observed using 
laser confocal scanning microscope. knockdown chmp4b sirna transient
expression chmp4b/c dominant negative forms markedly inhibited ndv growth in
df-1 cells. thus, cellular chmp4s play critical role ndv replication.
