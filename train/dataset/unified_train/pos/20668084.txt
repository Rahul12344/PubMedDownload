the nsp2 replicase protein porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus
(prrsv) recently demonstrated processed precursor pl2
protease near g(1196)|g(1197) dipeptide transfected cho cells. 
the proteolytic cleavage prrsv nsp2 investigated virally
infected marc-145 cells using two recombinant prrsvs expressing epitope-tagged
nsp2. data revealed prrsv nsp2 exists different isoforms, termed
nsp2a, nsp2b, nsp2c, nsp2d, nsp2e, nsp2f, prrsv infection. moreover,
on basis deletion mutagenesis antibody probing, nsp2 species
appeared share n terminus differ c termini. the
largest protein, nsp2a, corresponded nsp2 product identified in
transfected cho cells. nsp2b nsp2c processed within near the
transmembrane (tm) region, presumably near conserved sites
g(981)|g(982) g(828)|g(829)|g(830), respectively. c termini nsp2d,
-e, -f mapped within nsp2 middle hypervariable region, no
conserved cleavage sites could definitively predicted. larger nsp2 species
emerged almost simultaneously early stage prrsv infection. pulse-chase 
analysis revealed six nsp2 species relatively stable low
turnover rates. deletion mutagenesis revealed smaller nsp2 species
(e.g., nsp2d, nsp2e, nsp2f) essential viral replication cell 
culture. lastly, identified cellular chaperone, named heat shock 70-kda
protein 5 (hspa5), strongly associated nsp2, may have
important implications prrsv replication. overall, findings indicate
that prrsv nsp2 increasingly emerging multifunctional protein may
have profound impact prrsv replication viral pathogenesis.
