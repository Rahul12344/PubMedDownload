unique long 16 (ul16) viral glycoprotein produced host cell infected
with human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). regulates surface expression micb, 
one nkg2d ligands, forming stable intracellular complexes retained 
in endoplasmic reticulum. expression micb renders cells less
susceptible nk cell lysis via nkg2d receptor. diverse ul16 sequences 
identified different strains hcmv. micb known polymorphic. is
not known whether polymorphisms affect interactions these
molecules leading alteration immune surveillance hcmv. soluble
fc fusion variant ul16 proteins four laboratory clinical isolates
(ad169, toledo, ph, tr) produced. four allelic micb alleles (008, 003,
004, 00502) cloned stable cell lines expressing micb alleles
were produced. binding activities variant ul16 allelic micb proteins
were determined flow cytometry. variants ul16 proteins affect
the binding activities allelic micb proteins. however, diverse micb alleles
differentially bound ul16. found micb*008 contains methionine and
asparagine amino acid positions 98 113, respectively, alpha 2
domain showed decreased binding activities ul16 compared micb*003,
004, micb*00502 containing isoleucine aspartic acid, respectively. this
finding may imply micb*008 protective allele involved immune
surveillance hcmv infected patients.
