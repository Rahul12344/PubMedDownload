the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays critical role degradation of
short-lived regulatory proteins variety cellular processes. f-box
proteins part ubiquitin-ligase complexes, mediate ubiquitination
and proteasome-dependent degradation phosphorylated proteins. previously
identified nfb42, f-box protein highly enriched nervous system,
as binding partner herpes simplex virus 1 ul9 protein, viral
replication-initiator protein, yeast two-hybrid screen. present work,
we find coexpression nfb42 ul9 genes 293t cells leads a
significant decrease level ul9 protein. treatment the
26s-proteasome inhibitor mg132 restores ul9 protein normal levels. have
observed also ul9 protein polyubiquitinated vivo the
interaction nfb42 ul9 protein dependent upon phosphorylation
of ul9 protein. results suggest interaction ul9 protein
with nfb42 results polyubiquitination subsequent degradation the
26s proteasome. suggest mechanism latency herpes
simplex virus 1 established neuronal cells.
