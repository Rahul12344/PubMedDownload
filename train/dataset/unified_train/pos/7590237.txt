a novel cellular protein, abl-interactor-1 (abi-1), specifically interacts 
with carboxy-terminal region abl oncoproteins, identified a
mouse leukemia cell line. protein exhibits sequence similarity homeotic
genes, contains several polyproline stretches, includes src homology 3
(sh3) domain carboxyl terminus required binding abl
proteins. abi-1 gene mapped mouse chromosome 2 genetically
closely linked c-abl locus. gene widely expressed mouse,
with highest levels mrna found bone marrow, spleen, brain, testes. 
the abi-1 protein coimmunoprecipitates v-abl serves substrate for
kinase activity. overexpressed nih-3t3 cells, abi-1 potently suppresses
the transforming activity abelson leukemia virus expressing full-length
p160v-abl kinase affect transforming activity viruses
expressing truncated p90v-abl v-src kinases. suggest abi-1
protein may serve regulator abl function transformation signal
transduction.
