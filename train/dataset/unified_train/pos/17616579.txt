recently identified hepatitis c virus (hcv) isolates infectious cell 
culture provide genetic system evaluate significance virus-host
interactions hcv replication. completed systematic rnai screen
wherein sirnas designed target 62 host genes encoding proteins that
physically interact hcv rna proteins belong cellular pathways
thought modulate hcv infection. includes 10 host proteins we
identify study bind hcv ns5a. sirnas target 26 host
genes alter infectious hcv production >3-fold. included set 26 were
sirnas target dicer, principal component rnai silencing pathway.
contrary hypothesis rnai antiviral pathway mammals, has
been reported subgenomic hcv replicons, sirnas target dicer inhibited
hcv replication. furthermore, sirnas target several components 
rnai pathway also inhibit hcv replication. microrna profiling human liver,
human hepatoma huh-7.5 cells, huh-7.5 cells harbor replicating hcv
demonstrated mir-122 predominant microrna environment.
mir-122 previously implicated positively regulating replication
of hcv genotype 1 replicons. find 2'-o-methyl antisense oligonucleotide
depletion mir-122 also inhibits hcv genotype 2a replication infectious
virus production. data define 26 host genes modulate hcv infection and
indicate requirement functional rnai hcv replication dominant
over antiviral activity pathway may exert hcv.
