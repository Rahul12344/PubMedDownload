achieving aids-free generation require elimination postnatal
transmission hiv-1 maintaining nutritional immunologic benefits 
of breastfeeding infants developing regions. maternal/infant
antiretroviral prophylaxis reduce postnatal hiv-1 transmission, yet
toxicities development drug-resistant viral strains may limit the
effectiveness strategy. interestingly, absence antiretroviral
prophylaxis, greater 90% infants exposed hiv-1 via breastfeeding
remain uninfected, despite daily mucosal exposure virus 2 y.
moreover, milk uninfected women inherently neutralizes hiv-1 prevents
virus transmission animal models, yet factor(s) responsible this
anti-hiv activity well-defined. report, identify primary
hiv-1-neutralizing protein breast milk, tenascin-c (tnc). tnc an
extracellular matrix protein important fetal development wound healing,
yet antimicrobial properties previously established. purified
tnc captured neutralized multiclade chronic transmitted/founder hiv-1
variants, depletion tnc abolished hiv-1-neutralizing activity milk.
tnc bound hiv-1 envelope protein site induced upon engagement of
its primary receptor, cd4, blocked v3 loop- (19b f39f) and
chemokine coreceptor binding site-directed (17b) monoclonal antibodies. our
results demonstrate ability innate mucosal host protein found milk
to neutralize hiv-1 via binding chemokine coreceptor site, potentially
explaining majority hiv-1-exposed breastfed infants protected
against mucosal hiv-1 transmission.
