background: export intron containing viral rnas nucleus the
cytoplasm essential step life cycle human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (hiv-1). eukaryotic system permit transport intron
containing rna nucleus, hiv-1 makes regulatory protein, rev, that
mediates transportation unspliced partially spliced viral mrna from
the nucleus cytoplasm, thereby playing decisive role generation
of new infectious virus particles. therefore, host factors modulating rna
export activity rev major determinants virus production an
infected cell.
results: study, human staufen-2 (hstau-2) identified host factor
interacting hiv-1 rev affinity chromatography followed maldi
analyses. experiments involving transient expressions, sirna mediated
knockdowns infection assays conclusively established hstau-2 a
positive regulator hiv-1 pathogenesis. demonstrated rev-hstau-2
interactions positively regulated rna export activity rev promoted
progeny virus synthesis. rev-hstau-2 interaction independent rna
despite rna binding proteins. hstau-2 mutant, mutations at
q314r-a318f-k319e, deficient binding rev, failed promote hstau-2 dependent 
rev activity viral production, validating essentiality this
protein-protein interaction. expression positive regulator was
elevated upon hiv-1 infection human t-lymphocyte astrocyte cell
lines.
conclusions: study, establish human staufen-2, host factor
which up-regulated upon hiv-1 infection, interacts hiv-1 rev, thereby
promoting rna export activity progeny virus formation. altogether, our
study provides new insights emerging role staufen family mrna 
transporters host-pathogen interaction supports notion that
obliterating interactions viral host proteins positively
regulate hiv-1 proliferation significantly contribute anti-retroviral
treatments.
