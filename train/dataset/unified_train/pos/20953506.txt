hepatitis c virus (hcv) major cause chronic liver disease worldwide. here
we attempt understanding biological context protein
interactions hcv pathogenesis, investigating interactions hcv
proteins core ns4b human host proteins. using yeast two-hybrid (y2h) 
membrane protein system, eleven human host proteins interacting core 45 
interacting ns4b identified, novel. these
interactions used infer overall protein interaction maps linking the
viral proteins components host cellular networks. core ns4b
proteins contribute highly compact interaction networks may enable the
virus respond rapidly host physiological responses hcv infection.
analysis interaction networks highlighted enriched biological pathways
likely influenced hcv infection. inspection individual interactions offered
further insights possible mechanisms permit hcv evade host
immune response appropriate host metabolic machinery. follow-up cellular
assays cell lines infected hcv genotype 1b 2a strains validated
core interacting proteins eno1 slc25a5 host protein pxn novel
regulators hcv replication viral production. eno1 sirna knockdown was
found inhibit hcv replication hcv genotypes viral rna release 
in genotype 2a. pxn sirna inhibition observed inhibit replication
specifically genotype 1b genotype 2a, slc25a5 sirna
facilitated minor increase viral rna release genotype 2a. thus, our
analysis provide potential targets effective anti-hcv therapeutic
intervention.
