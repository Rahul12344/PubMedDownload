the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (crpv) b subtypes display conserved 
e8 open reading frame encoding 50-amino-acid hydrophobic protein, with
structural similarities e5 transmembrane oncoprotein genital human pvs 
(hpvs). crpv e8 reported play role papilloma growth to
be essential papilloma formation. report knockout e8 start
codon almost prevented wart induction upon biobalistic inoculation viral dna
onto rabbit skin. scarce warts induced showed slow growth, despite
sustained expression e6 e7 oncogenes. points essential role 
e8 disturbing epidermal homeostasis. using yeast two-hybrid screen, found
that e8 interacted zinc transporter znt1, protocadherin 1 (pcdh1), and
ahnak/desmoyokin, three proteins yet unrelated viral pathogenesis cell
transformation. hpv16 e5 also interacted proteins two-hybrid assay.
crpv e8 mainly localized golgi apparatus early endosomes of
transfected keratinocytes colocalized znt1, pcdh1, ahnak. showed 
that znt1 pcdh1 formed complex e8 disrupted complex. crpv e8,
like hpv16 e5, increased epidermal growth factor (egf)-dependent extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2) phosphorylation egf-dependent
and egf-independent activity activating protein-1 (ap-1). competition
experiments nonfunctional truncated znt1 protein showed e8-znt1
interaction required ap-1 activation. data identify crpv e8 key 
player papilloma induction unravel novel cellular targets inducing the
proliferation keratinocytes.
