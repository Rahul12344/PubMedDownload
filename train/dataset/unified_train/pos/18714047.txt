hiv type 1 (hiv-1) assembly egress driven viral protein gag and
occur plasma membrane cells. recent evidence indicates secretory
vesicles machinery essential components virus packaging t
cells macrophages. however, pathways cellular mediators gag
targeting plasma membrane well characterized. lck, lymphoid
specific src kinase critical cell activation, found plasma
membrane well various intracellular compartments suggested 
to influence hiv-1 replication. investigate lck potential regulator of
gag targeting, assessed hiv-1 replication gag-induced virus-like particle 
release presence absence lck. release hiv-1 virus-like
particles reduced absence lck. decrease replication not
due altered hiv-1 infection, transcription protein translation. however, in
t cells lacking lck, hiv-1 accumulated intracellularly. addition, expressing
lck hela cells promoted hiv-1 gag plasma membrane localization. palmitoylation
of lck unique domain, essential directing lck plasma
membrane, critical effect hiv-1 replication. furthermore, hiv-1
gag directly interacted lck unique domain context infected
cells. results indicate lck plays key role targeting hiv-1 gag to
the plasma membrane cells.
