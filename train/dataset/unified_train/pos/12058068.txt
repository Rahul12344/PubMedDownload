the vacuolar atpase (v-atpase) multisubunit enzyme facilitates the
acidification intracellular compartments eukaryotic cells plays an
important role receptor-mediated endocytosis, intracellular trafficking
processes, protein degradation. study show c-terminal
fragment 350 residues regulatory subunit h (v1h) v-atpase shares
structural functional homologies beta-chains adaptor protein
complexes. moreover, fragment similar region beta-subunit of
copi coatomer complexes, suggests existence shared domain these
three different families proteins. beta-adaptins, fragment binds to
cytoplasmic di-leucine-based sorting motifs hiv-1 nef mediate
endocytic trafficking. expression fragment cells blocks the
internalization transmembrane proteins, depend di-leucine-based
motifs, whereas mutation consensus sequence gey partly diminishes the
recognition sorting motif. based recent structural analysis, our
results suggest di-leucine-binding domain consists heat arm
repeat protein fold.
