we examined relationship sequence-specific dna-binding proteins 
that activate transcription e1a-inducible adenovirus early promoters. factors 
previously referred e4f1 e2a-ef bind e4 e2a promoters,
respectively. demonstrate e4f1 e2a-ef identical dna-binding
specificity. moreover, e4f1 e2a-ef activate transcription e4 
e2a promoters vitro. findings demonstrate e4f1 e2a-ef the
same factor, designated activating transcription factor, atf. in
addition e4 e2a promoters, atf binds important functional
element e1a-inducible e3 promoter. interaction common activator
protein, atf, multiple e1a-inducible early viral promoters, suggests a
significant role atf e1a-mediated transcriptional activation.
