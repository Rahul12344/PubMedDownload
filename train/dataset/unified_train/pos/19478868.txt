the interferon-induced transmembrane protein bst-2/cd317 (tetherin) restricts the
release diverse enveloped viruses infected cells. hiv-1 accessory
protein vpu antagonizes restriction unknown mechanism likely
involves down-regulation bst-2 cell surface. here, show that
the optimal removal bst-2 plasma membrane vpu requires the
cellular protein beta-trcp, substrate adaptor multi-subunit scf e3
ubiquitin ligase complex known vpu-interacting protein. beta-trcp also
required optimal enhancement virion-release vpu. mutations the
dsgxxs beta-trcp binding-motif vpu impair down-regulation bst-2
and enhancement virion-release. mutations also confer
dominant-negative activity, consistent model vpu links bst-2 to
beta-trcp. optimal down-regulation bst-2 cell surface vpu also
requires endocytic clathrin adaptor ap-2, although rate endocytosis is
not increased; data suggest vpu induces post-endocytic membrane
trafficking events whose net effect removal bst-2 cell
surface. addition marked effect cell-surface levels, vpu modestly
decreases total cellular levels bst-2. decreases cell-surface and
intracellular bst-2 inhibited bafilomycin a1, inhibitor endosomal
acidification; data suggest vpu induces late endosomal targeting and
partial degradation bst-2 lysosomes. vpu-mediated decrease surface
expression associated reduced co-localization bst-2 virion
protein gag along plasma membrane. together, data support model in
which vpu co-opts beta-trcp/scf e3 ubiquitin ligase complex induce
endosomal trafficking events remove bst-2 site action a
virion-tethering factor.
