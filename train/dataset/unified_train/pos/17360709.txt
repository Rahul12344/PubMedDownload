similar viruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) depends
heavily cellular factors successful replication. study have
investigated interaction hiv-1 integrase (in) several host nuclear
import factors using co-immunoprecipitation assays. results indicate 
interacts specifically host importin 7 (imp7) vivo, interact
with importin 8 (imp8) importin alpha (rch1). contrast, another hiv-1
karyophilic protein map17, capable binding rch1, fails interact
with imp7, suggesting map17 may interact different cellular
pathways hiv-1 replication. genetic analysis revealed c-terminal 
domain region responsible interaction imp7, 
an mutant (k240a,k244a/r263a,k264a) disrupted imp7 binding ability 
protein, indicating regions ((235)wkgpakllwkg (262)rrkak) within
the c-terminal domain required efficient in/imp7 interaction. using
a vesicular stomatitis virus g glycoprotein pseudotyped hiv single-cycle
replication system, showed in/imp7 interaction-deficient mutant was
unable mediate viral replication displayed impairment viral
reverse transcription nuclear import steps. moreover, transient knockdown 
imp7 hiv-1 producing target cells resulted 2.5-3.5-fold
inhibition hiv infection. altogether, results indicate hiv-1 in
specifically interacts imp7, viral/cellular protein interaction
contributes efficient hiv-1 infection.
