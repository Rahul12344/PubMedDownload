recurrent infections high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated 
with human cervical cancers. hpv-associated cancer tissues express viral 
oncoproteins e6 e7, stimulate cell growth. expression e7 is
crucial initiation maintenance hpv-associated cancer.
recent studies showed level e7 cancer cells regulated by
ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis 26s proteasome. study, we
characterized enzymes involved ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis e7. 
we show ubch7, e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, specifically involved 
in ubiquitination e7. furthermore, show e7 interacts scf 
(skp-cullin-f box) ubiquitin ligase complex containing cullin 1 (cul1) skp2
and ubiquitinated cul1-containing ubiquitin ligase vitro.
coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed e7 interacts skp2 cul1 in
vivo. finally, half-life e7 found significantly longer in
skp2(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts (mefs) wild-type mefs. taken together,
these results suggest cul1- skp2-containing ubiquitin ligase plays a
role ubiquitination proteolysis e7. hpv type 16-containing
cervical carcinoma cell line caski, e7 localizes cytoplasm the
nucleus. brief treatment caski cells mg132 (a proteasome inhibitor)
causes accumulation e7 discrete nuclear bodies. nuclear bodies
are detergent insoluble contain polyubiquitinated e7. suggest e7
relocates specific nuclear bodies proteolysis hpv-containing epithelial
cells.
