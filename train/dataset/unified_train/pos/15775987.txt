like tumor cells, dna viruses evolve mechanisms uncouple
cellular replication many intra- extracellular factors normally
control it. show adenovirus encodes two proteins activate the
mammalian target rapamycin (mtor) viral replication, even under
nutrient/growth factor-limiting conditions. e4-orf1 mimics growth factor
signaling activating pi3-kinase, resulting increased rheb.gtp loading and
mtor activation. e4-orf4 redundant glucose stimulating mtor, 
affect rheb.gtp levels major mechanism whereby adenovirus activates
mtor quiescent primary cells. demonstrate mtor activated 
mechanism dependent e4-orf4 protein phosphatase 2a-binding domain.
we also show mtor activation required efficient s-phase entry,
independently e2f activation, adenovirus-infected quiescent primary cells. 
these data reveal adenovirus evolved proteins activate mtor
pathway, irrespective cellular microenvironment, play a
requisite role viral replication.
