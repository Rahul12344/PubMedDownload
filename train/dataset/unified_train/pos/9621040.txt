the purpose study determine whether cell surface protein that
can serve coreceptor herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) entry,
herpesvirus entry mediator (previously designated hvem renamed hvea), also
mediates hsv-1-induced cell-cell fusion. found transfection dna from
kos-804, previously described hsv-1 syncytial (syn) strain whose syn mutation
was mapped amino acid substitution gk, induced numerous large syncytia
on hvea-expressing chinese hamster ovary cells (cho-hvem12) control
cells (cho-c8). antibodies specific gd well hvea effective
inhibitors kos-804-induced fusion, consistent previously described direct
interactions gd hvea. since mutations gd determine ability 
hsv-1 utilize hvea entry, examined whether form virally
expressed gd also influenced ability hvea mediate fusion. produced a
recombinant virus carrying kos-804 syn mutation kos-rid1 gd mutation,
which significantly reduces viral entry via hvea, designated kos-sr1.
kos-sr1 dna markedly reduced ability induce syncytia cho-hvem12 cells
and somewhat enhanced ability induce syncytia cho-c8 cells. results
support previous findings concerning relative abilities kos kos-rid1
to infect cho-hvem12 cho-c8 cells. thus, hvea mediates cell-cell fusion as
well viral entry activities hvea contingent upon form of
gd expressed virus.
