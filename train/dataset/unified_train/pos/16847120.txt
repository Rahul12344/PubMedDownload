hepatitis c virus (hcv) interacts human platelets vivo potential
transport infectious virions target liver. binding native viral 
particles platelet membrane glycoprotein vi (gpvi) analysed. a
consistent interaction hcv plasma purification two
different methods recombinant extracellular immunoglobulin (ig)-like
domains human gpvi (hd1d2) observed two independent experimental
approaches: pull-down elisa assays. 2 7 % hcv particles were
specifically bound hd1d2. binding inhibited anti-hd1d2 a
dose-dependent manner. human d1d2 interaction hcv significantly higher
than murine d1d2, supporting specificity interaction the
single human domains (d1 d2), suggesting ig-like domains the
molecule required efficient binding. gpvi may platelet surface
ligand hcv playing role viral transport persistence.
