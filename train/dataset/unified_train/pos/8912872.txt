adeno-associated virus (aav) rep78 multifunctional protein required 
for aav transcriptional activity, aav dna replication, possibly for
site-specific integration aav human chromosome 19. rep78 also able 
inhibit variety heterologous promoters, including c-h-ras, human
papillomavirus types 16 18, hiv type 1. however, rep78 unable to
significantly affect murine osteosarcomavirus (msv). noticed that
promoters inhibited possess binding motifs cellular
transcription factor sp1, whereas msv long terminal repeat promoter not. 
these data stimulated hypothesis rep78 may recognize interact with
cellular sp1. here, demonstrate rep78 able interact sp1 in
vitro analyzed west(far)-western, electrophoretic mobility shift
assay-supershift, coimmunoprecipitation analyses. furthermore, support 
an vivo biological effect interaction, rep78 demonstrated to
inhibit synthetic, sp1-dependent promoter. still, insertion sp1 
dna binding motifs rep78-resistant msv long terminal repeat results a
promoter increased sensitivity inhibition rep78. finally, is
demonstrated sp1-rep78 interaction requires amino half rep78. the
interaction rep78 sp1, along possible downstream effects the
transcription initiation process rna polymerase ii, may partially explain 
rather broad-based antitumor abilities aav.
