histone acetyltransferases (hats) histone deacetylases (hdacs) known to
interact several transcription factors regulate transcriptional
activities. human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) tax oncoprotein
activates transcription long terminal repeat (ltr) interaction
with cellular factors creb transcriptional coactivator cbp/p300.
however, little known interaction tax transcriptional
repressors. here, demonstrate physical functional interaction 
tax hdac1. found hdac1 represses trans-activation function tax
in 293t mt4 cells. however, repression restored treatment an
hdac inhibitor, trichostatin a. also observed physical interaction tax
and hdac1 vitro vivo. n-terminal region hdac1 (amino acid
residues 28-97) required binding. moreover, hdac1 inhibited the
synergistic trans-activation tax observed ectopic expression cbp.
however, repression relieved overexpression cbp. thus, hdac1 is
likely compete cbp binding tax functions negative
regulator transcriptional activation tax.
