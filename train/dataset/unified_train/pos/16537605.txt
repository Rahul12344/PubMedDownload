feline leukemia virus (felv) horizontally transmitted virus causes a
variety proliferative immunosuppressive diseases cats. four
subgroups felv, a, b, c, t, distinct receptor
requirement. receptors felv-a subgroup defined
previously. here, report identification cellular receptor for
felv-a, transmissible form felv. receptor cdna was
isolated using gene transfer approach, involved introducing sequences
from feline cell line permissive felv-a murine cell line not
permissive. feline cdna identified method approximately 3.5 kb,
and included open reading frame predicted encode protein 490 amino
acids. feline cdna conferred susceptibility felv-a reintroduced into
nonpermissive cells, render cells permissive other
felv subgroup. moreover, cells specifically bound felv-a-pseudotyped virus 
particles, indicating cdna encodes binding receptor felv-a. the
feline cdna shares approximately 93% amino acid sequence identity human 
thiamine transport protein 1 (thtr1). human thtr1 receptor also
functional receptor felv-a, albeit reduced efficiency compared to
the feline orthologue. basis data, strongly suggest the
feline protein orthologue human thtr1, named feline
receptor fethtr1. identification receptor allow detailed
studies early events felv transmission may provide insights into
felv pathogenesis.
