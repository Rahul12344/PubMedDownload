viral pathogenesis infected cell balance antiviral responses 
and subversion host-cell processes. many viral proteins specifically interact 
with host-cell proteins promote virus biology. understanding these
interactions lead knowledge gains infection provide potential
targets antiviral therapy. one virus ebola, profound
consequences human health causes viral hemorrhagic fever case
fatality rates approach 90%. ebola virus vp24 protein plays critical
role evasion host immune response likely interact with
multiple cellular proteins. map interactions better understand the
potential functions vp24, label-free quantitative proteomics used to
identify cellular proteins high probability forming vp24
cellular interactome. several known interactions confirmed, thus placing
confidence technique, new interactions also discovered including 
one atp1a1, involved osmoregulation cell signaling.
disrupting activity atp1a1 ebola-virus-infected cells small
molecule inhibitor resulted decrease progeny virus, thus illustrating how
quantitative proteomics used identify potential therapeutic targets.
