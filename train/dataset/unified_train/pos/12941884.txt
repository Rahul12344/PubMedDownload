the latent nuclear antigen (lna) kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(kshv) essential role viral latent infection. lna maintains the
stability kshv episomes modulates expression cellular genes. a
novel cellular protein klip1 identified interact lna yeast
two-hybrid screening, confirmed glutathione s-transferase pull down
assay. domain mapping showed klip1 interacted n-terminal domain 
lna. northern blot hybridization klip1 probe identified major transcript
of 1.8 kb minor transcript 2.8 kb. cdna library screening 5'-race
revealed major transcript encoded open-reading-frame 1,257 bp 
had 5'-untranslated region 73 nucleotides. major klip1 transcript was
ubiquitously present different cell types examined. klip1 synthetic peptide 
antibody detected doublet 58-kda 63-kda proteins western blot
assay. klip1 two putative nuclear localization signals showed punctate
nuclear localization expressed gfp-fusion protein. klip1 interacted
with lna vivo, demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation using kshv-infected
cells colocalization expressed gfp- dsred-fusion
proteins, respectively. consistent interaction lna, nuclear
localization, possession two leucine zipper motifs, klip1 behaved like a
transcriptional factor repressed herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (tk)
promoter activity mammalian one-hybrid assay. addition, cotransfection
with lna alleviated transcriptional repression effect klip1 tk promoter
activity. results suggest klip1 new member cellular
transcriptional repressors, lna involved deregulating cellular
transcription process.
