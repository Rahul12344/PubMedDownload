herpes simplex virus 1 mutants lacking gene encoding glycoprotein (gd) 
the gd normally present envelope virus (gd(-/-) stocks) mutants 
lacking gd gene containing trans-induced gd envelopes (gd(-/+)) 
cause apoptosis human sk-n-sh cells. gd(-/-) virions taken by
endocytosis degraded, whereas gd(-/+) viruses replicate produce
gd(-/-) virus. apoptosis blocked delivery gd gene trans. studies 
designed test several hypotheses concerning role gd apoptosis
revealed following. (i) gd(-/-) gd(-/+) stocks induce fragmentation of
cellular dna sk-n-sh, hep-2, hela, vero cell lines. (ii) chloroquine
blocks apoptosis induced gd(-/-) stocks gd(-/+) stocks. drug
also rescues gd(-/-) degradation. (iii) cells transduced with
cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (ci-mpr) block apoptosis induced 
by either gd(-/-) gd(-/+) virus. (iv) expression sequences antisense the
cloned ci-mpr gene induced apoptosis themselves. wild-type virus not
gd(-/-) gd(-/+) stocks mutant virus blocked apoptosis induced the
expression ci-mpr antisense sequences. results exclude possibility
that block apoptosis, gd must interact hvea receptor, member the
tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor family. instead, data suggest gd
blocks influx lysosomal enzymes endosomal compartment binding 
to ci-mpr. conclusion consistent published reports that
phosphorylated gd interacts ci-mpr.
