cystatin c human cysteine proteinase inhibitor present extracellular
fluids. cystatin c tripeptide derivative (z-lvg-chn2) mimics its
proteinase-binding center, tested possible antiviral activity against
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv) poliovirus type 1. recombinant
cystatin c z-lvg-chn2 displayed strong inhibitory effects hsv replication,
whereas significant effect poliovirus replication seen. molar
concentration cystatin c gave total inhibition hsv replication was
lower either z-lvg-chn2 acyclovir, drug currently most
used hsv infections. results suggest cysteine proteinase
inhibitors might play physiological role inhibitors viral replication and
that proteinase inhibitors, peptide derivatives mimic their
proteinase-binding centers, might used antiviral agents.
