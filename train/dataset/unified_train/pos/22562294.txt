hepatitis b virus x (hbx) protein reported induce upregulation of
β-catenin, known proto-oncogene, p53-knockout p53-mutant hepatic cell
lines gsk-3β-dependent manner via interaction adenomatous
polyposis coli, results protection β-catenin degradation. this
study, describe novel mechanism hbx-mediated upregulation β-catenin. 
we observed hbx interacts sirt1, class iii histone deacetylase.
furthermore, presence hbx attenuated interaction sirt1 and
β-catenin, leading protection β-catenin inhibitory action of
sirt1. reduction sirt1 sirna suppression sirt1 activity with
nicotinamide upregulated β-catenin protein levels. contrast, enhancement of
sirt1 activity resveratrol reduced β-catenin protein levels. furthermore, in
hep3b cells stably expressing hbx, overexpression sirt1 treatment with
resveratrol enhanced sensitivity doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, indicating
that upregulation sirt1 could therapeutic strategy hbv-related
hepatocellular carcinoma. based results, propose hbx upregulates
β-catenin sequestering sirt1, leads anticancer drug treatment
resistance.
