background: ns1 protein influenza virus able bind many
proteins affect cellular signal transduction protein synthesis in
infected cells. ns1 protein consists approximately 230 amino acids the
last 4 amino acids ns1 c-terminal form pdz binding motif. postsynaptic
density protein-95 (psd-95), mainly expressed neurons, 3 pdz
domains. hypothesise ns1 binds psd-95, binding able to
affect neuronal function.
result: conducted yeast two-hybrid analysis, gst-pull assays and
co-immunoprecipitations detect interaction ns1 psd-95. the
results showed ns1 avian influenza virus h5n1
(a/chicken/guangdong/1/2005) able bind psd-95, whereas ns1 human
influenza virus h1n1 (a/shantou/169/2006) unable so. results also
revealed ns1 h5n1 significantly reduces production nitric oxide
(no) rat hippocampal neurons.
conclusion: summary, study indicates ns1 influenza virus can
bind neuronal psd-95, avian h5n1 human h1n1 influenza viruses 
possess distinct binding properties.
