infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) etiologically involved liver
cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma b-cell lymphomas. been
demonstrated previously hcv non-structural protein 3 (ns3) involved in
cell transformation. study, yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was
conducted identify cellular proteins interacting hcv ns3 protein.
cytosolic 5'(3')-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdn, dnt-1) found interact with
hcv ns3 protein. binding domains hcv ns3 cellular cdn proteins also
determined using yeast two-hybrid system. interactions hcv ns3 and
cdn proteins demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation confocal
analysis cultured cells. cellular cdn activity partially repressed 
ns3 protein transiently-transfected stably-transfected
systems. furthermore, hcv partially repressed cdn activity no
effect protein expression systems hcv sub-genomic replicons 
infectious hcv virions. deoxyribonucleotidases present mammalian
cells involve regulation intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools
by substrate cycles. control dna precursor concentration essential 
maintenance genetic stability. reduction cdn activity would result the
imbalance dna precursor concentrations. thus, results suggested hcv
partially reduced cdn activity via ns3 protein may turn cause
diseases.
