the granule exocytosis pathway cytotoxic lymphocytes plays critical roles in
eradication intracellular viruses. however, hepatitis b virus (hbv) is
cleared defined. clarify immune mechanisms underlying inhibition 
of hbv replication, relationship granzyme h (gzmh) hbv
clearance investigated. study, found granule exocytosis
pathway inhibit hbv replication without induction cytolysis the
infected cells. gzmh essential hbv eradication. hbx protein (hbx),
required replication hbv, cleaved met(79) gzmh. gzmh
inhibitor abolish gzmh- lymphokine-activated killer cell-mediated hbx
degradation hbv clearance. hbx-deficient hbv resistant gzmh- and
lymphokine-activated killer cell-mediated viral clearance. adoptive transfer of
gzmh-overexpressing nk cells hbv carrier mice facilitates vivo hbv
eradication. importantly, low gzmh expression cytotoxic lymphocytes of
individuals susceptible hbv infection hepatocellular carcinoma. these
results indicate gzmh might detected potential parameter for
diagnosis hbv infection hepatocellular carcinoma.
