we report alterations murine leukemia virus (mlv) integrase (in) protein
that successfully result decreasing integration frequency transcription
start sites cpg islands, thereby reducing potential insertional
activation. host bromo extraterminal (bet) proteins brd2, 3 4
interact mlv protein primarily bet protein et domain.
using solution nmr, protein interaction studies, next generation sequencing, 
we show c-terminal tail peptide region mlv important the
interaction bet proteins disruption interaction through
truncation mutations affects global targeting profile mlv vectors. use
of unstructured tails gammaretroviral ins direct association with
complexes active promoters parallels used histones rna polymerase 
ii. viruses bearing mlv c-terminal truncations provide new avenues to
improve safety profile gammaretroviral vectors human gene therapy.
