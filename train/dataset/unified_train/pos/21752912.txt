influenza virus uses cellular protein transport systems (e.g., crm1-mediated
nuclear export rab11-dependent recycling endosomes) genome trafficking
from nucleus plasma membrane, new virions assembled.
however, detailed mechanisms events completely
resolved, additional cellular factors probably required. here, we
investigated role cellular human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)
rev-binding protein (hrb), interacts influenza virus nuclear export
protein (nep), influenza virus life cycle. using small interfering 
rnas (sirnas) overexpression dominant negative hrb protein fragment, 
show cells lacking functional hrb significantly reduced production of
influenza virus progeny defect results impaired viral
ribonucleoprotein (vrnp) delivery plasma membrane late-stage infection.
since hrb colocalizes influenza vrnps early delivery the
cytoplasm, may mediate connection nucleocytoplasmic transport
machinery endosomal system, thus facilitating transfer vrnps 
nuclear export cytoplasmic trafficking complexes. also found association
between nep hrb perinuclear region, suggesting nep may contribute
to process. results identify hrb second endosomal factor a
crucial role influenza virus genome trafficking, suggest cooperation between
unique endosomal compartments late steps influenza virus life
cycle, provide common link cytoplasmic trafficking mechanisms
of influenza virus hiv.
