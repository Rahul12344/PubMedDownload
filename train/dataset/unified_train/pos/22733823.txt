the human neutrophil peptide 1 (hnp-1) known block human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection, mechanism inhibition 
is poorly understood. examined effect hnp-1 hiv-1 entry fusion
and found that, surprisingly, α-defensin inhibited multiple steps virus
entry, including: (i) env binding cd4 coreceptors; (ii) refolding env
into final 6-helix bundle structure; (iii) productive hiv-1 uptake but
not internalization endocytic markers. despite lectin-like properties,
hnp-1 could bind env, cd4, host proteins glycan- and
serum-independent manner, whereas fusion inhibitory activity greatly
attenuated presence human bovine serum. demonstrates that
binding α-defensin molecules involved hiv-1 fusion necessary 
sufficient blocking virus entry. therefore propose oligomeric
forms defensin, may disrupted serum, contribute anti-hiv-1 
activity perhaps cross-linking virus and/or host glycoproteins. this
notion supported ability hnp-1 reduce mobile fraction cd4 
and coreceptors plasma membrane precipitate core subdomain env
in solution. ability hnp-1 block hiv-1 uptake without interfering 
constitutive endocytosis suggests novel mechanism broad activity against
this viruses enter cells endocytic pathways.
