the fusion glycoprotein (f) respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), mediates 
membrane fusion virus entry, shown bind rhoa, small gtpase, yeast
two-hybrid interaction studies. interaction confirmed vivo by
mammalian two-hybrid assay rsv-infected hep-2 cells by
coimmunoprecipitation. furthermore, interaction f rhoa confirmed 
in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay biomolecular interaction
analysis. yeast two-hybrid interaction studies various deletion mutants f
and rhoa indicate key binding domains proteins are
contained within, overlap, amino acids 146 155 67 110, respectively.
the biological significance interaction studied rsv-infected hep-2
cells stably transfected overexpress rhoa. positive
correlation rhoa expression rsv syncytium formation, indicating 
rhoa facilitate rsv-induced syncytium formation.
