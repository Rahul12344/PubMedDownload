hepatitis b virus (hbv) encoded x protein (hbx) implicated apoptotic 
and related pathogenic events hepatocellular carcinoma. however, the
underlying molecular mechanism hbx acts largely unclear. used
tandem affinity purification mild conditions gain insight hbx
interactome hbv-producing hepg2.2.15 cells identified 49 proteins mass 
spectrometry potentially associated hbx. two key proteins of
the caspase-independent apoptosis pathway newly identified,
apoptosis-inducing factor (aif) homologous amid (aif-homologue
mitochondrion-associated inducer death). confirmed interactions hbx 
with aif amid reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments,
respectively. observed expression hbx-reduced aif-mediated apoptosis
and hbx colocalization aif amid, principally cytoplasm.
furthermore, elevated cytoplasmic levels hbx could inhibit
mitochondrion-to-nucleus translocation aif. here, present first
detailed molecular evidence hbx repress apoptosis via inhibition 
caspase-independent apoptosis pathway. inhibition apoptosis involves 
repression mitochondrion-to-nucleus translocation aif, although tests
with amid conclusive. findings provide important insights the
new mechanism apoptosis inhibition hbv.
