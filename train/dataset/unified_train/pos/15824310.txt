infected cell protein 0 (icp0) 775-residue multifunctional herpes simplex
virus protein associated numerous functions related transactivation of
gene expression repression host defenses infection. report an
uncharted domain icp0 located residues 245 510 contains multiple
sh3 domain binding motifs similar required binding cin85, the
m(r) 85,000 protein interacts cbl. cin85 cbl involved in
endocytosis negative regulation numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. we
report icp0 binds cin85 reciprocal manner complexes pulled
down icp0 also contain cbl. tested role icp0 down-regulation 
of receptor tyrosine kinases using epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr) 
a prototypic receptor. transfection assays, icp0, absence other
viral genes, down-regulated egf-dependent expression reporter gene
(luciferase). icp0 also down-regulated total cell surface levels egfr
in egf-independent manner. wild-type virus-infected cells, surface levels 
of egfr also decreased absence egf stimulation. stimulation egf
enhanced decrease surface egfr. conclude icp0 encodes sh3 domain
binding sites function down-regulate signaling pathways associated with
receptor tyrosine kinases. results suggest icp0 precludes signaling to
the infected cells receptor tyrosine kinases.
