hepatitis c virus (hcv) sets persistent infection patients likely
involves complex virus-host interaction. previously found hcv
nonstructural 5a (ns5a) protein interacts growth factor receptor-binding
protein 2 (grb2) adaptor protein inhibits activation extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 2 (erk1/2) epidermal growth factor (egf). in
the present study, extended analysis investigated specificity 
the grb2-ns5a interaction whether subversion mitogenic signaling
involves additional pathways. ns5a containing mutations within c-terminal
proline-rich motif neither bound grb2 inhibited erk1/2 activation egf,
demonstrating ns5a-grb2 binding downstream effects due direct
interactions. interestingly, ns5a could also form complex the
grb2-associated binder 1 (gab1) protein egf treatment-dependent manner.
however, ns5a-gab1 association, appeared indirect, mediated 
direct ns5a-grb2 interaction likely dependent direct ns5a interaction 
with p85 subunit phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k). vivo
association ns5a p85 pi3k required n-terminal, the
c-terminal, region ns5a. downstream effects ns5a-p85 pi3k
interaction included increased tyrosine phosphorylation p85 pi3k response
to egf. consistent observation antiapoptotic properties of
ns5a, also detected enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation downstream akt
protein kinase increased serine phosphorylation bad, proapoptotic factor
and akt substrate, presence ns5a. results collectively suggest
a model ns5a interacts grb2 inhibit mitogenic signaling while
simultaneously promoting pi3k-akt cell survival pathway interaction with
p85 pi3k, may represent crucial step hcv persistence pathogenesis.
