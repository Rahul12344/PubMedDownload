pcna monoubiquitinated response dna damage fork stalling then
initiates recruitment specialized polymerases dna damage tolerance
pathway, translesion synthesis (tls). since pcna reported associate with
epstein-barr virus (ebv) dna replication, investigated whether 
ebv deubiquitinating (dub) enzyme encoded bplf1 targets ubiquitinated pcna and
disrupts tls. n-terminal bplf1 fragment (a bplf1 construct containing the
first 246 amino acids [bplf1 1-246]) associated pcna attenuated its
ubiquitination response fork-stalling agents uv hydroxyurea cultured
cells. moreover, monoubiquitinated pcna deubiquitinated incubation with
purified bplf1 1-246 vitro. bplf1 1-246 dysregulated tls reducing
recruitment specialized repair polymerase polymerase η (polη) the
detergent-resistant chromatin compartment virtually abolished localization of
polη nuclear repair foci, hallmarks tls. expression bplf1 1-246
decreased viability uv-treated cells led cell death, presumably through
deubiquitination pcna inability repair damaged dna. importantly,
deubiquitination pcna could detected endogenously ebv-infected cells 
comparison samples expressing short hairpin rna (shrna) bplf1.
further, specificity interaction bplf1 pcna dependent 
upon pcna-interacting peptide (pip) domain within n-terminal region of
bplf1. dub activity pip sequence conserved members the
family herpesviridae. thus, deubiquitination pcna, normally deubiquitinated by
cellular usp1, viral dub disrupt repair dna damage compromising 
recruitment tls polymerase stalled replication forks. pcna first
cellular target identified bplf1 deubiquitinating activity.
