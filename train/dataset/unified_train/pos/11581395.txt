during lytic infections, virion host shutoff (vhs) protein (ul41) herpes
simplex virus destabilizes host viral mrnas. accelerating mrna decay,
it helps determine levels kinetics viral cellular gene expression.
in vivo, vhs shows strong preference mrnas, opposed non-mrnas, and
degrades 5' end mrnas prior 3' end. contrast, partially purified
vhs restricted mrnas causes cleavage target rnas various
sites throughout molecule. explain discrepancy, searched for
cellular proteins interact vhs using saccharomyces cerevisiae
two-hybrid system. vhs found interact human translation
initiation factor, eif4h. interaction verified glutathione
s-transferase pull-down experiments coimmunoprecipitation vhs and
epitope-tagged eif4h extracts mammalian cells. interaction was
abolished several point mutations vhs abrogate ability degrade 
mrnas vivo. results suggest vhs viral mrna degradation factor
that targeted mrnas, regions translation initiation, an
interaction eif4h.
