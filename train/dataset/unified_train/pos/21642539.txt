the complement system plays pivotal protective role innate immune
response many pathogens including flaviviruses. flavivirus nonstructural
protein 1 (ns1) secreted nonstructural glycoprotein accumulates in
plasma high levels displayed surface infected cells but
absent viral particles. previous work defined immune evasion role 
flavivirus ns1 limiting complement activation forming complex c1s
and c4 promote cleavage c4 c4b. study, demonstrate second
mechanism, also involving c4 active fragment c4b, ns1
antagonizes complement activation. dengue, west nile, yellow fever virus ns1
directly associated c4b binding protein (c4bp), complement regulatory
plasma protein attenuates classical lectin pathways. soluble ns1
recruited c4bp inactivate c4b solution plasma membrane. mapping 
studies revealed interaction sites ns1 c4bp partially overlap with
the c4b binding sites. together, studies define immune evasion 
potential ns1 reducing functional capacity c4 complement
activation control flavivirus infection.
