murine polyomavirus middle t-antigen (mt) induces tumors mimicking an
activated growth factor receptor. essential component action a
22-amino-acid hydrophobic region close c terminus locates mt cell
membranes. here, demonstrate sequence transmembrane domain
(tmd) showing hemagglutinin (ha) tag added mt c terminus is
exposed outside cells, n terminus inside. determine
whether mt tmd inserted endoplasmic reticulum (er) membrane, 
added er retention signal kdel mt c terminus (mtkdel). mutant
protein locates er, demonstrating mt insert membranes 
solely location. addition, er-located mt failed transform.
examination binding proteins associated mtkdel protein
demonstrated associates pp2a c-src fails interact with
shca, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), phospholipase c-γ1 (plc-γ1),
despite tyrosine phosphorylated. additional mutant antibody studies
show mt binding pp2a probably required mt efficiently exit 
er migrate plasma membrane though tmd also plays role this
relocation. overall, data, together previous publications, illustrate 
that mt associates signaling proteins different sites maturation
pathway. mt binds pp2a cytoplasm, c-src endoplasmic
reticulum, shca, pi3k, plc-γ1 subsequent locations en route 
plasma membrane.
