optimal hiv vaccines elicit cd8+ cells specific hiv proteins
presented mhc class products, cells contribute host
resistance viruses. previously found targeting antigen to
dendritic cells (dcs) mice efficiently induces cd8+ cell responses. to
extend finding humans, introduced hiv p24 gag protein mab
that targets dec-205/cd205, endocytic receptor dcs. assessed
cross-presentation, processing nonreplicating internalized
antigen onto mhc class recognition cd8+ cells. low doses of
alphadec-gag, control ig-gag, stimulated proliferation ifn-gamma
production cd8+ cells isolated blood hiv-infected donors.
alphacd205 fusion mab effective cross-presentation than
alphacd209/dc-sign, another abundant dc uptake receptor. presentation was
diverse, identified eight different gag peptides recognized 
via dec-205 11 individuals studied consecutively. results, based humans
with highly polymorphic mhc products, reveal dcs dec-205 can
cross-present several different peptides single protein. the
consistency eliciting cd8+ cell responses, data support testing of
alphadec-205 fusion mab protein-based vaccine.
