hiv tat enhance activation-induced up-regulation fas ligand (fasl), 
may contribute cell apoptosis human immune deficiency virus
(hiv)-infected individuals. assessed functional physical interactions
between tat egr family transcription factors (egr-1, -2, -3), 
latter two major participants activation-induced fasl
up-regulation. report whereas tat effect fasl
promoter, binds egr-2 -3 synergizes superinduce
expression fasl promoter-driven reporter. tat molecule containing single
amino acid substitution results loss transactivation activity 
the hiv long terminal repeat still binds egr-3 longer enhance
egr-mediated transactivation fasl promoter. furthermore, mutated tat
acts dominant negative inhibitor, blocking superinduction fasl caused
by wild type tat. tat present virus-infected cells serum
of hiv-infected individuals, results suggest increased expression of
fasl circumstances may result cooperative activities of
activation-induced egrs tat.
