hiv-1 rev plays important role late phase hiv-1 replication, which
facilitates export unspliced viral mrnas nucleus cytoplasm in
infected cells. recent studies shown ddx1 ddx3 co-factors of
rev export hiv-1 transcripts. report, demonstrated
that ddx5 (p68), multifunctional dead-box rna helicase, functions a
new cellular co-factor hiv-1 rev. found ddx5 affects rev function
through rev-rre axis subsequently enhances hiv-1 replication. confocal
microscopy co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated ddx5 binds rev
and interaction largely dependent rna. dead-box motif ddx5
is mutated, ddx5 loses almost ability bind rev, indicating 
the dead-box motif ddx5 required interaction ddx5 rev. 
our data indicate interference ddx5-rev interaction could reduce hiv-1
replication potentially provide new molecular target anti-hiv-1
therapeutics.
