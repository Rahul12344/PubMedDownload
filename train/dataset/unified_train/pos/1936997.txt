the tar element extending -17 +80 human immunodeficiency virus
long terminal repeat (hiv ltr) required activation gene expression by
the tat trans-activator protein. tar rna forms stable stem-loop structure, 
mutagenesis studies indicate stem structure, primary sequence the
loop, bulge element major determinants tat activation. rna
gel retardation analysis demonstrates tat cellular proteins bind to
tar rna, mechanism proteins increase hiv gene expression
is unknown. fractionated hela cell nuclear extracts attempt to
identify cellular proteins bind tar rna involved regulating
hiv gene expression. rna gel retardation uv cross-linking reveal a
cellular protein 185 kd, designate tar rna-binding protein 185
(trp-185), binds high affinity marked specificity tar rna. rna
gel retardation competition analyses indicate trp-185 binding is
strongly dependent tar rna loop sequences. binding trp-185 is
modulated set cellular cofactors tat protein. highly
purified preparations trp-185 capable activating vitro transcription
of wild-type, mutated, hiv ltr chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat)
constructs. results characterize positively acting cellular rna-binding
factor, trp-185, involved regulation hiv gene expression.
