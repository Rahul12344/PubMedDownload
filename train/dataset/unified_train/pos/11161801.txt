here report cloning characterization hivep3, newest member in
the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 enhancer-binding protein family that
encodes large zinc finger proteins regulates transcription via kappab
enhancer motif. largest open reading frame hivep3 contains 2406 aa. is
approximately 80% identical mouse counterpart. hivep3 gene located 
in chromosomal region 1p34 least 300 kb 10 exons. rna studies 
show multiple hivep3 transcripts differentially expressed regulated.
additionally, transcription termination occurs ultimate exon, exon 10, 
in exon 6. therefore, hivep3 may produce protein isoforms contain exclude
the carboxyl dna binding domain leucine zipper alternative rna
splicing differential polyadenylation. sequence homologous hivep3 exon 6
is found mouse paralogous genes hivep1 hivep2. zoo-blot
analysis suggests sequences homologous human exon 6 present 
in primates cow. therefore, foreign dna harboring termination exon likely
was inserted hivep3 locus relatively recently evolution, resulting in
the acquisition novel gene regulatory mechanisms well generation 
structural functional diversity.
