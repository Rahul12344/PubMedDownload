lactoferrin (lf), natural defence iron-binding protein, found to
possess antibacterial, antimycotic, antiviral, antineoplastic and
anti-inflammatory activity. protein present exocrine secretions that
are commonly exposed normal flora: milk, tears, nasal exudate, saliva,
bronchial mucus, gastrointestinal fluids, cervico-vaginal mucus seminal
fluid. additionally, lf major constituent secondary specific granules
of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns). apoprotein released
on degranulation pmns septic areas. principal function lf 
of scavenging free iron fluids inflamed areas suppress free
radical-mediated damage decrease availability metal invading
microbial neoplastic cells. mechanisms action lf addition iron
deprivation also described. administration exogenous human bovine lf to
hosts various infected inflamed sites resulted prophylactic
or therapeutic effects. however, adverse response protein might occur
if stimulate antibody production provide iron 
invading pathogen. recombinant form human lf become available and
development product use wide range medical conditions 
be anticipated.
