the hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) essential virus replication 
been implicated development liver cancer. hbx recruited viral and
cellular promoters activates transcription interacting transcription 
factors coactivators. here, purified hbx-associated factors nuclear
extracts hepg2 hepatoma cells identified protein arginine
methyltransferase 1 (prmt1) novel hbx-interacting protein. showed that
prmt1 overexpression reduced transcription hepatitis b virus (hbv), and
this inhibition dependent methyltransferase function prmt1.
conversely, depletion prmt1 correlated increased hbv transcription. using
a quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, found prmt1 is
recruited hbv dna, suggesting direct effect prmt1 regulation of
hbv transcription. finally, showed hbx expression inhibited
prmt1-mediated protein methylation. downregulation prmt1 activity 
observed hbv-replicating cells vivo animal model. altogether, our
results support notion binding hbx prmt1 might benefit viral
replication relieving inhibitory activity prmt1 hbv transcription.
