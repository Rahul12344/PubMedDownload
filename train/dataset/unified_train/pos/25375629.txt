interferon-γ inducible factor 16 (ifi16) multifunctional nuclear protein
involved transcriptional regulation, induction interferon-β (ifn-β), and
activation inflammasome response. interacts sugar-phosphate
backbone dsdna modulates viral cellular transcription largely 
undetermined mechanisms. ifi16 restriction factor human cytomegalovirus 
(hcmv) herpes simplex virus (hsv-1), though mechanisms hsv-1
restriction yet understood. here, show ifi16 profound
effect hsv-1 replication human foreskin fibroblasts, osteosarcoma cells,
and breast epithelial cancer cells. ifi16 knockdown increased hsv-1 yield 6-fold 
and ifi16 overexpression reduced viral yield 5-fold. importantly, hsv-1
gene expression, including immediate early proteins, icp0 icp4, early
proteins, icp8 tk, late proteins gb us11, reduced the
presence ifi16. depletion inflammasome adaptor protein, asc, the
ifn-inducing transcription factor, irf-3, affect viral yield. chip
studies demonstrated presence ifi16 bound hsv-1 promoters in
osteosarcoma (u2os) cells fibroblasts. using crispr gene editing technology, 
we generated u2os cells permanent deletion ifi16 protein expression. chip

decreased repressive chromatin viral cellular gene promoters.
collectively, studies first time demonstrate ifi16 prevents
