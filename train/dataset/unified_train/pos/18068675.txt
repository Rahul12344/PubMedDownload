icp34.5, encoded herpes simplex virus 1, protein phosphatase 1 (pp1)
regulatory subunit mediates dephosphorylation alpha subunit of
translation initiation factor 2 (eif2alpha). however, mechanism action
remains poorly understood. here, show amino acid substitutions the
arginine-rich motif differential effects icp34.5 activity. phenotypes
parallel viral protein synthesis cytopathic effects virus infected
cells. besides consensus pp1 binding motif, arg-motif appears enhance 
the interaction icp34.5 pp1. results suggest concerted
action pp1 binding domain effector domain icp34.5 is
crucial eif2alpha dephosphorylation viral protein synthesis.
