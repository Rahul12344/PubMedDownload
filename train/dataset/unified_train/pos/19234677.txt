hepatitis c virus (hcv) major cause liver disease. however, detailed 
mechanism underlying hepatocyte infection hcv yet completely
understood. previously identified novel c-type lectin--lsectin predominantly
expressed liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. demonstrate lsectin
can interact two hcv receptors, dc-signr cd81, central
ectodomain. furthermore, cells expressing lsectin specifically attached by
the naturally occurring hcv sera infected individuals. binding was
found mediated hcv e2 glycoprotein could efficiently
inhibited egta mannan treatment. present study suggests that
lsectin interaction dc-signr might contribute hcv binding liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells.
