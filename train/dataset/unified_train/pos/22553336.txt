in report, analyzed whether degradation mrnas the
nonsense-mediated mrna decay (nmd) pathway affected human t-lymphotropic
virus type 1 (htlv-1)-infected cells. pathway indeed strongly inhibited 
in c91pl, hut102, mt2 cells, effect also observed sole
expression tax protein jurkat hela cells. line this
activity, tax binds int6/eif3e (here called int6), subunit the
translation initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eif3) required 
efficient nmd, well nmd core factor upstream frameshift protein 1
(upf1). also observed tax expression alters morphology of
processing bodies (p-bodies), cytoplasmic structures concentrate rna
degradation factors. presence upf1 subcellular compartments was
increased tax, whereas int6 decreased. line effects,
the level phosphorylated form upf1 increased presence of
tax. analysis several mutants viral protein showed interaction
with int6 necessary nmd inhibition. alteration mrna stability was
observed affect viral transcripts, coding htlv-1 basic
leucine zipper factor (hbz), also several cellular mrnas sensitive nmd
pathway. data indicate effect tax viral cellular gene
expression restricted transcriptional control also involve
posttranscriptional regulation.
