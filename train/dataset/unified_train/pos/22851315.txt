to produce progeny virus, human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1) gag
assembles capsids package viral genome bud infected
cell. assembly immature capsids, gag traffics pathway of
assembly intermediates (ais) contain cellular adenosine triphosphatase
abce1 (atp-binding cassette protein e1). paper, showed by
coimmunoprecipitation immunoelectron microscopy (iem) these
gag-containing ais also contain endogenous processing body (pb)-related proteins,
including ago2 ribonucleic acid (rna) helicase ddx6. moreover, found a
similar complex containing abce1 pb proteins uninfected cells.
additionally, knockdown rescue studies demonstrated rna helicase
ddx6 acts enzymatically facilitate capsid assembly independent rna
packaging. using iem, localized defect ddx6-depleted cells gag
multimerization plasma membrane. also confirmed ddx6 depletion
reduces production infectious hiv-1 primary human cells. thus, we
propose assembling hiv-1 co-opts preexisting host complex containing
cellular facilitators ddx6, virus uses catalyze capsid
assembly.
