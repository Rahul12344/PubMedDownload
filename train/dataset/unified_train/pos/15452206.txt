the x gene hepatitis b virus (hbv) one major factors hbv-induced 
hepatocarcinogenesis essential establishment productive hbv
replication vivo. recent studies shown x gene product targets
mitochondria induces calcium flux, thereby activating ca(+)-dependent signal 
transduction pathways. however, regulatory mechanisms x gene expression have
remained unclear. previous studies localized minimal promoter activity a
21-bp gc-rich sequence located 130 bp upstream x protein coding region and
showed cellular protein bound dna. interestingly, the
21-bp sequence identified x gene minimal promoter contain any
previously identified core promoter elements, tata box. better
understand mechanisms transcriptional initiation x gene, set out
to biochemically purify binding protein(s) 21-bp dna. report 
the identification x gene minimal promoter-binding activity nuclear
respiratory factor 1 (nrf1), previously known transcription factor that
activates majority nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes various
housekeeping genes. primer extension analyses x mrnas show mutations 
at binding site specifically inactivate transcription promoter 
that dominant-negative nrf1 mutant short interfering rnas inhibit
transcription promoter. therefore, nrf1 specifically binds 21-bp
minimal promoter positively contributes transcription x gene.
simultaneous activation x gene mitochondrial genes nrf1 may allow
the x protein target mitochondria efficiently.
