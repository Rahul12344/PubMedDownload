virion infectivity factor (vif) protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) essential productive infection primary human cd4 t
lymphocytes macrophages. vif overcomes hiv-inhibitory effects cellular
factor apobec3g, cytidine deaminase activity. previously reported
the isolation vif-interacting ring finger protein, triad 3, human
leukocyte cdna library, using yeast two-hybrid system. full-length
cellular protein homologue triad 3 recently identified zinc
finger protein inhibiting nf-kappab (zin). sequence analysis indicates triad
3 protein contains four major ring-like motifs zin. report that
zin binds purified vif vitro triad 3/zin interacts hiv-1 vif 
in transfected human 293t cells, demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation. to
test biological relevance interaction, produced infectious hiv-1
nl4.3 presence absence cotransfected zin. hiv-1 nl4.3 virus stocks
produced presence exogenously expressed zin twofold less
infectious single-cycle infectivity assay virus produced absence
of exogenous zin. shown cells infected hiv nl4.3 virus
stocks produced presence exogenously expressed zin impaired in
viral dna synthesis twofold. impairment viral reverse transcription and
the reduction single-cycle viral infectivity shown dependent
on presence vif virus producer cells. possible mechanisms by
which zin interferes early events hiv-1 replication discussed.
