mannose-binding lectin (mbl) key soluble effector innate immune
system recognizes pathogen-specific surface glycans. surprisingly,
low-producing mbl genetic variants may predispose children and
immunocompromised individuals infectious diseases common would
be expected human populations. since certain immune defense molecules, as
immunoglobulins, exploited invasive pathogens, hypothesized mbl
might also enhance infections circumstances. consequently, low and
intermediate mbl levels commonly found human populations might result
of balancing selection. using model infection systems pseudotyped and
authentic glycosylated viruses, demonstrated mbl indeed enhances
infection ebola, hendra, nipah west nile viruses low complement
conditions. mechanistic studies ebola virus (ebov) glycoprotein pseudotyped 
lentiviruses confirmed mbl binds n-linked glycan epitopes viral
surfaces specific manner via mbl carbohydrate recognition domain, 
is necessary enhanced infection. mbl mediates lipid-raft-dependent
macropinocytosis ebov via pathway appears require less actin or
early endosomal processing compared filovirus canonical endocytic
pathway. using validated rna interference screen, identified c1qbp (gc1qr)
as candidate surface receptor mediates mbl-dependent enhancement ebov
infection. also identified dectin-2 (clec6a) potentially novel candidate 
attachment factor ebov. findings support concept innate immune 
haplotype represents critical interactions mbl complement
component c4 genes may modify susceptibility resistance certain
glycosylated pathogens. therefore, higher levels native exogenous mbl could
be deleterious setting relative hypocomplementemia occur

confirm hypothesis pressure infectious diseases may have
contributed part evolutionary selection mbl mutant haplotypes.
