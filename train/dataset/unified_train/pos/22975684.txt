latent membrane protein 2a (lmp2a) epstein-barr virus-encoded protein 
is important maintenance latent infection. activity affects
cellular differentiation, migration, proliferation b cell survival. lmp2a
resembles constitutively activated b cell antigen receptor exploits host
kinases activate set downstream signaling pathways. current study 
we demonstrate interaction lmp2a intersectin 1 (itsn1), key
endocytic adaptor protein. interaction occurs via n- c-tails of
lmp2a mediated sh3 domains itsn1. additionally, identified
the shb adaptor syk kinase novel binding ligands itsn1. shb
adaptor interacts simultaneously phosphorylated tyrosines lmp2a and
the sh3 domains itsn1 mediates indirect interaction itsn1 lmp2a. syk
kinase promotes phosphorylation itsn1 shb adaptors in
lmp2a-expressing cells. contrast itsn1, shb phosphorylation depends
additionally lyn kinase activity. considering shb itsn1 are
implicated various receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, results indicate
that lmp2a affect number signaling pathways regulating the
phosphorylation itsn1 shb adaptors.
