the ns3 protein hepatitis c virus (hcv) serine protease activity 
n-terminal region, plays crucial role virus replication. region
has also reported interact viral cofactor ns4a, but
also number host-cell proteins, suggests multifunctional
feature ns3. means yeast two-hybrid screening using n-terminal region
of ns3 bait, human cdna encoding region elks-delta, member novel
family proteins involved intracellular transport secretory pathways,
was molecularly cloned. using co-immunoprecipitation, gst pull-down confocal 
and immunoelectron microscopic analyses, shown full-length ns3
interacted physically full-length elks-delta splice variant,
elks-alpha, absence presence ns4a, cultured human cells,
including huh-7 cells harbouring hcv subgenomic rna replicon. degree of
binding elks-delta varied different sequences n-terminal 180
residues ns3. interestingly, ns3, either full-length n-terminal fragments, 
enhanced secretion secreted alkaline phosphatase (seap) cells, and
the increase seap secretion correlated well degree binding between
ns3 elks-delta. taken together, results suggest possibility that
ns3 plays role modulating host-cell functions intracellular
transport secretion binding elks-delta elks-alpha, which
may facilitate virus life cycle and/or mediate pathogenesis hcv.
