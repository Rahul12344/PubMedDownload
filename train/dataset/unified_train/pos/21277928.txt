the innate immune system acts first line host defense against
pathogens. one mechanisms used involves early recognition uptake
of microbes host professional phagocytes, pattern recognition
receptors (prrs). prrs bind conserved microbial ligands expressed by
pathogens initiate innate adaptative immune responses. prrs
located surface dendritic cells (dcs) cells seem play an
important role human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) transmission.
dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin, 
cd209 (dc-sign) homolog, dc-sign-related (dc-signr l-sign) receptors
are pprs able bind hiv-1 gp120 envelope protein and, alterations
in expression patterns also occur, might play role both
horizontal vertical transmission well disseminating virus within
the host. review aims explore involvement dc-sign l-sign
receptors hiv-1 transmission mother child.
