human adenovirus type 5 (hadv5) e4orf6 (early region 4 open reading frame 6
protein) multifunctional early viral protein promoting efficient replication
and progeny production. e4orf6 complexes e1b-55k assemble cellular
proteins functional e3 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates
proteasomal degradation host cell substrates also facilitates export of
viral late mrna promote efficient viral protein expression host cell
shutoff. recent findings defined role e4orf6 rna splicing independent
of e1b-55k binding. reveal functions early viral protein in
infected cells, used yeast two-hybrid system identified homeobox
transcription factor hoxb7 novel e4orf6-associated protein. using hoxb7
knockdown cell line, observed positive role hoxb7 adenoviral
replication. experiments demonstrate absence hoxb7 leads to
inefficient viral progeny production, hadv5 gene expression highly
regulated hoxb7-mediated activation various adenoviral promoters. have
thus identified novel role e4orf6 hadv5 gene transcription via regulation
of homeobox protein-dependent modulation viral promoter activity.
