adenovirus type 5 encodes 14.7-kda protein protects infected cells from
tumor necrosis factor-induced cytolysis unknown mechanism. report, 
we demonstrate infection cells adenovirus vector expressing fas
ligand induced rapid apoptosis blocked coinfection virus
expressing 14. 7k. moreover, adfasl/g infection resulted rapid activation 
of devd-specific caspases, caspase activation blocked coinfection with
ad14.7/g. cell death induced overexpression fas ligand, fas-associated 
death domain-containing protein (fadd)/mort1, fadd-like
interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (flice)/caspase-8 virus-free system 
efficiently blocked 14.7k expression. moreover, demonstrate 14.7k
interacts flice. results support idea flice cellular
target 14.7-kda protein.
