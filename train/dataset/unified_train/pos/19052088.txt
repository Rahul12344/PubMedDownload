we previously observed high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv16) e7
expression leads delocalization dynein mitotic spindles (c. l.
nguyen, m. e. mclaughlin-drubin, k. munger, cancer res. 68:8715-8722, 2008). 
here, show hpv16 e7 associates nuclear mitotic apparatus protein 1
(numa) numa binding ability induce dynein delocalization map 
to similar carboxyl-terminal sequences e7. additionally, show the
delocalization dynein mitotic spindles hpv16 e7 interaction
between hpv16 e7 numa correlate induction defects chromosome
alignment prometaphase even cells normal centrosome numbers.
furthermore, low-risk hpv6b hpv11 e7s also associate numa also
induce similar mitotic defect. possible disruption mitotic
events hpv e7, via targeting numa/dynein complex potentially 
numa-containing complexes, contributes viral maintenance propagation
potentially abrogating differentiation program infected
epithelium. furthermore, concert activities specific high-risk hpv e6 
and e7, inactivation p53 prb tumor suppressors,
respectively, disruption numa/dynein network may result mitotic
errors would make infected cell prone accumulation of
aneuploidy even absence supernumerary centrosomes.
