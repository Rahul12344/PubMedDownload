we shown complement factor h (cfh) interacts hiv-1 level of
the sequence env 105-119, contained c1 domain gp120. cfh interaction
with hiv evident dissociation env complex induced by
exposure scd4. hypothesized cfh could act gp41 analog the
interaction env 105-119. panel partially overlapping, synthetic
peptides reproducing extracellular portion gp41 therefore used to
compete binding cfh env 105-119. three sets peptides competed
this interaction identified. peptides defined region functional
homology gp41 molecule cfh (env 580-600), two regions of
interaction (env 620-640 env 650-670). addition this, monoclonal
antibody directed peptide env 580-600 polyclonal mouse antiserum
raised recombinant gp41 shown recognize cfh western blots 
elisa, respectively, also defining region antigenic homology gp41
and cfh. data provide evidence interaction molecular mimicry
between hiv structural protein negative regulator complement
pathway. show cfh interact hiv env proteins,
suggesting possible efficient mechanism downregulation complement
cascade surface infected cells.
