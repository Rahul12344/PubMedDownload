transcription regulation dna-bound activators thought mediated a
direct interaction proteins tata-binding protein (tbp), tfiib, 
or tbp-associated factors, although occasionally cofactors adapters are
required. ligand-induced activation retinoic acid receptor-retinoid x 
receptor (rar-rxr) heterodimer, rar beta 2 promoter dependent the
presence e1a e1a-like activity, since promoter activated by
retinoic acid cells expressing proteins. mechanism underlying
this e1a requirement largely unknown. show direct interaction
between rar e1a requirement retinoic acid-induced rar beta 2
activation. activity hormone-dependent activation function 2 (af-2) of
rar beta upregulated e1a, interaction region e1a
was observed, af-1 af-2 rxr alpha. interaction is
dependent conserved region iii (criii), 13s mrna-specific region e1a.
deletion analysis within region indicated complete criii needed 
for activation. putative zinc finger region crucial, probably a
consequence interaction tbp. furthermore, region surrounding amino
acid 178, partially overlapping tbp binding region, involved 
binding activation af-2. propose e1a functions cofactor by
interacting tbp rar, thereby stabilizing preinitiation complex.
