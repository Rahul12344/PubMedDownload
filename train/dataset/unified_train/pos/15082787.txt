pathogens exploit host machinery establish environment favors their
propagation. pivotal roles cellular physiology, protein
degradation pathways common targets viral proteins. protein-linking
integrin-associated protein cytoskeleton 1 (plic1), also called ubiquilin,
contains amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (ubl) domain carboxy-terminal
ubiquitin-associated (uba) domain. plic1 proposed function regulator
of ubiquitination complex proteasome machinery. kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) contains small membrane protein, k7, that
protects cells apoptosis induced various stimuli. report that
cellular plic1 k7-interacting protein central hydrophobic
region k7 carboxy-terminal uba domain plic1 responsible for
their interaction. cellular plic1 formed dimer bound efficiently to
polyubiquitinated proteins carboxy-terminal uba domain, this
activity correlated ability stabilize cellular kappa b protein. 
contrast, k7 interaction prevented plic1 forming dimer binding to
polyubiquitinated proteins, leading rapid degradation kappa b.
furthermore, k7 expression promoted efficient degradation p53 tumor
suppressor, resulting inhibition p53-mediated apoptosis. results
indicate kshv k7 targets regulator ubiquitin- and
proteasome-mediated degradation machinery deregulate cellular protein
turnover, potentially provides favorable environment viral
reproduction.
