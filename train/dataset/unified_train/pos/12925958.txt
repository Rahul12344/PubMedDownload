treatment hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc) cells butyrate induce
apoptosis irrespective hepatitis b virus integration. information is
available, however, regarding effect butyrate hcc presence of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) hcv proteins regulate cell survival. 
gene transfer, found hcv core enhances hcv ns5a antagonizes sodium
phenylbutyrate (napb)-induced apoptosis hcc cells, independent of
p53. chose p53-negative hep3b hcc cell investigate mechanism
of anti-apoptosis mediated ns5a. napb-treated hep3b cells without ns5a 
expression, induction apoptosis associated bax redistribution from
the cytosol nucleus interior subsequently, nuclear membrane-bound
form. ns5a expressing hep3b cells, napb treatment also triggered
relocalization bax ns5a cytosol nucleus interior 
bax retained inside nucleus finally move nuclear membrane.
using double immunofluorescence coimmunoprecipitation, demonstrated that
ns5a co-localizes interacts bax nucleus. hcv ns5a protein was
further found contain bcl-2 homology domains (bh3, bh1 bh2). additional
studies using deleted ns5a constructs carried determine whether the
bh2 domain nuclear localization signal (nls) ns5a required for
interaction bax nucleus inhibition apoptosis. ns5a with
deletion bh2 domain nls localized cytoplasm, dissociated 
bax, lost anti-apoptosis activity napb treatment. contrast, ns5a
with intact bh domains except nls still bound directly bax perinuclear 
region nucleus, showed less association bax nucleus and
lower effect apoptosis inhibition full-length ns5a. results suggest
that hcv ns5a bcl-2 homologue interacts bax protect p53-negative hcc
cells napb-induced apoptosis.
