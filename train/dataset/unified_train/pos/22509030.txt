kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv), etiologically associated with
kaposi's sarcoma, uses integrins (α3β1, αvβ3, αvβ5) associated signaling 
to enter human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (hmvec-d), vivo
target infection. kshv infection activated c-cbl, induced selective 
translocation kshv lipid rafts (lrs) along α3β1, αvβ3, xct
receptors, αvβ5. lr-translocated receptors monoubiquitinated,
leading productive macropinocytic entry, whereas non-lr-associated αvβ5 was
polyubiquitinated, leading clathrin-mediated entry targeted to
lysosomes. molecule(s) integrate signal pathways productive 
kshv macropinocytosis unknown, immunoprecipitated kshv-infected lr
fractions anti-α3β1 antibodies analyzed mass spectrometry. the
tyrosine kinase ephrina2 (epha2), implicated many cancers, identified in
this analysis. epha2 activated kshv. epha2 also associated kshv
and integrins (α3β1 αvβ3) lrs early infection. preincubation of
virus soluble epha2, knockdown epha2 shrnas, pretreatment cells 
with anti-epha2 monoclonal antibodies tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib
significantly reduced kshv entry gene expression. epha2 associates with
c-cbl-myosin iia augmented kshv-induced src pi3-k signals lrs, leading
to bleb formation macropinocytosis kshv. epha2 shrna ablated
macropinocytosis-associated signaling events, virus internalization, and
productive nuclear trafficking kshv dna. taken together, studies
demonstrate epha2 receptor acts master assembly regulator of
kshv-induced signal molecules kshv entry endothelial cells suggest
that epha2 receptor attractive target controlling kshv infection.
