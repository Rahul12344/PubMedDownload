the nkg2d receptor expressed surface nk, t, macrophage lineage
cells plays important role antiviral antitumor immunity. evade
nkg2d recognition, herpesviruses block expression nkg2d ligands the
surface infected cells using diverse repertoire sabotage methods. cowpox 
and monkeypox viruses taken alternate approach encoding soluble
nkg2d ligand, orthopoxvirus major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class
i-like protein (omcp), block nkg2d-mediated cytotoxicity. approach
has advantage targeting single conserved receptor instead numerous
host ligands exhibit significant sequence diversity. here, show omcp
binds nkg2d homodimer monomer competitively blocks host ligand
engagement. also determined 2.25-Ã¥-resolution crystal structure of
omcp cowpox virus brighton red strain, revealing truncated mhc class
i-like platform domain consisting beta sheet flanked two antiparallel
alpha helices. omcp generally similar structure known host nkg2d ligands
but notable variations regions typically used engage nkg2d.
additionally, determinants responsible 14-fold-higher affinity of
omcp human murine nkg2d mapped single loop nkg2d
ligand-binding pocket.
