in herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1), binding clusters enriched ctcf during
latency previously identified. hypothesized ctcf binding to
ctcf clusters hsv-1 would disrupted reactivation event. to
investigate, ctcf occupation three ctcf binding clusters hsv-1 analyzed
following sodium butyrate (nab)- explant-induced reactivation mouse.
our data show ctcf domains positioned within hsv-1 genome,
specifically around latency-associated transcript (lat) icp0 icp4
regions genome, lose ctcf occupancy following application of
reactivation stimuli wild-type virus. also found ctcf binding clusters
upstream icp0 icp4 promoters function classical insulators
capable acting enhancer blockers lat enhancer. finally, results 
suggest ctcf occupation domains hsv-1 may differentially regulated 
both latency early times following reactivation presence 
lytic transcripts implicate epigenetic regulation hsv-1 a
critical component latency-reactivation transition.
