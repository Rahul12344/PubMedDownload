background: replication transcription activator (rta) kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) molecular switch initiates a
productive replication latent kshv genomes. kshv rta (k-rta) composed of
691 amino acids high ser thr content (17.7%), extent these
ser thr modified vivo explored.
methods: using tandem mass spectrometric analysis affinity-purified flag
tagged k-rta, sought identify ser thr residues are
post-translationally modified k-rta.
results: found k-rta o-glcnacylated protein thr-366/thr-367 
the primary motif o-glcnacylation vivo. biological significance of
o-glcnac modified thr-366 thr-367 assessed site-specific amino acid
substitution. replacement thr ala amino acid 366 367 caused a
modest enhancement k-rta transactivation activity luciferase reporter
assay cell model kshv reactivation. using co-immunoprecipitation
coupled western blot analysis, showed capacity k-rta in
associating endogenous parp1 significantly reduced the
thr-366/thr-367 o-glcnac mutants. parp1 documented negative regulator of
k-rta ascribed attachment large negatively charged polymer 
onto k-rta via parp1's poly (adp-ribose) polymerase activity. agreement,
shrna-mediated depletion o-glcnac transferase (ogt) kshv infected cells
augmented viral reactivation virus production accompanied by
diminished k-rta parp1 complexes.
conclusions: kshv latent-lytic switch k-rta modified cellular
o-glcnacylation, imposes negative effect k-rta transactivation
activity. inhibitory effect involves ogt parp1, two nutritional sensors 
recently emerging chromatin modifiers. thus, speculate activity of
k-rta target genes continuously checked modulated ogt parp1 
in response cellular metabolic state.
