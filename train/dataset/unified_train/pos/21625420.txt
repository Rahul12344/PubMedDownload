the multi-functional ns1 protein influenza virus viral virulence
determining factor. last four residues c-terminus ns1 constitute 
type pdz domain binding motif (pbm). avian influenza viruses currently in
circulation carry ns1 pbm consensus sequence esev, whereas human
influenza viruses bear ns1 pbm consensus sequence rskv rsev. pbm
sequence influenza virus ns1 reported contribute high viral
pathogenicity animal studies. here, report identification pdlim2 
a novel binding target highly pathogenic avian influenza virus h5n1 strain
with ns1 pbm esev (a/chicken/henan/12/2004/h5n1, hn12-ns1) yeast
two-hybrid screening. interaction confirmed vitro gst pull-down
assays, well vivo mammalian two-hybrid assays bimolecular
fluorescence complementation assays. binding also confirmed be
mediated interaction pdlim2 pdz domain ns1 pbm motif.
interestingly, assays showed pdlim2 bound specifically hn12-ns1,
but exhibited binding ns1 human influenza h1n1 virus bearing rsev
pbm (a/puerto rico/8/34/h1n1, pr8-ns1). crystal structure pdlim2 pdz
domain fused c-terminal hexapeptide hn12-ns1, together gst
pull-down assays pdlim2 mutants, reveals residues arg16 lys31 of
pdlim2 critical binding pdlim2 hn12-ns1. the
identification selective binding target hn12-ns1 (esev), pr8-ns1 
(rsev), enables us propose structural mechanism interaction 
ns1 pbm pdlim2 pdz-containing proteins.
