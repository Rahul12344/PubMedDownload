the high-molecular-weight dendritic cytoskeletal protein known as
microtubule-associated protein (map)-2 displays capacity stimulate tubulin
polymerization associate microtubules. serine proteases cleave map-2 
into c-terminal m(r) 28,000-35,000 microtubule-binding fragment larger
n-terminal m(r) 240,000 projection-arm region. show human
immunodeficiency virus (hiv) proteinase also progressively degrades purified
map-2 vitro. proteolysis reaction characterized transient

microtubules. treatment m(r) 72,000 species thrombin releases the
same m(r) 28,000 component derived thrombin action intact
high-molecular-weight map-2, indicating viral aspartoproteinase action
preferentially occurs toward n-terminus. association m(r)

acid peptide analogue second repeated sequence map-2
microtubule-binding region. also studied hiv proteinase action map-2 the
presence tubulin maps recycle tubulin, contrary to
other published studies found effect treatment microtubule
self-assembly behavior. cleavage isolated map-2 hiv enzyme high salt
concentrations, followed desalting addition tubulin, also resulted in
microtubule assembly, albeit slightly reduced efficiency.
