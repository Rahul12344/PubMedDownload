the jc virus (jcv) control region contains agggaaggga, tandem pentanucleotide
repeat element (pnt2). several proteins specifically interacted via pnt2 to
regulate expression jcv early promoter-enhancer (jcv(e)) late
promoter-enhancer (jcv(l)). study, jcv pnt2 oligonucleotide probe was
used screen cdna expression library glial p19 mouse embryonal carcinoma
cells. cdna clone isolated southwestern blot assay produced a
protein reproducibly specifically bound pnt2. cdna 100%
homology one three previously identified mouse cdnas called cellular
nucleic acid binding proteins (cnbps). cnbps highly homologous family of
eukaryotic genes implicated functional interactions cytoplasmic rna and
regulatory dna elements. mrna 2.2 kb pnt2-interacting cnbp (pcnbp) was
seen undifferentiated, muscle glial p19 cells. expressed cdna
expression vector fusion protein also contained 115 kda from
beta-galactosidase, pnt2 binding protein (pcnbp) specifically bound pnt2 
southwestern blots 30 kda component 145 kda fusion protein.
furthermore, jcv(e) expression negatively regulated pcnbp produced vivo
from cdna expression vector. regulation jcv(l) unaffected. suggest 
a novel role cnbp pcnbp interacts pnt2 negative
transcriptional regulation jcv(e).
