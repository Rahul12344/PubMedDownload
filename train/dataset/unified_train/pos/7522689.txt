using normal human serum edta-plasma two sources s-protein
(vitronectin) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, determined heparin
pretreatment immobilized rgp120 immobilized cd4 caused serum form of
s-protein deposit dose-dependent manner. interestingly, edta-plasma
form s-protein (native form) little interaction either the
heparin-treated surfaces. several sulfated polysaccharides dextran 
sulfate, pentosan polysulfate, heparan sulfate, fucoidan, likewise mediated
the deposition serum form s-protein immobilized rgp120 cd4. these
findings may explain certain glycosaminoglycans effective hiv
infectivity cell culture serum form s-protein present, yet
ineffective vivo native form s-protein predominant. the
elevated glycosaminoglycan levels gingival crevicular exudates, coupled with
the effects serum form s-protein salivary-mediated neutralization
mechanisms may explain reduced rates salivary hiv transmission.
