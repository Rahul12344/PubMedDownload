the epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded lmp1 oncogene role transformation, 
proliferation, metastasis several ebv-associated tumors. furthermore, lmp1
is critically involved transformation growth ebv-immortalized b cells
in vitro. oncogenic properties lmp1 attributed ability to
upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins growth signals. transcriptional
regulation lmp1 dependent context cellular viral proteins
present cell. here, investigated effect several signaling
pathways regulation lmp1 expression. inhibition p38 signaling, using
p38-specific inhibitors sb203580 sb202190, downregulated lmp1 in
estrogen-induced ereb2.5 cells. similarly, p38 inhibition decreased trichostatin 
a-induced lmp1 expression p3hr1 cells. exogenous expression p38 in
lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) led increase lmp1 promoter activity 
reporter assays, activation mediated previously identified
cre site promoter. inhibition p38 sb203580 p38-specific small
interfering rna (sirna) also led modest decrease endogenous lmp1
expression lcls. chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated decreased binding 
creb-atf1 cre site lmp1 promoter inhibition p38
pathway ereb2.5 cells. taken together, results suggest increase in
p38 activation upregulates lmp1 expression. since p38 activated response to
stimuli stress possibly primary infection, transient upregulation of
lmp1 response p38 may allow cells escape apoptosis. since p38
pathway activated lmp1, results also suggest presence 
autoregulatory loop lmp1 upregulation.
