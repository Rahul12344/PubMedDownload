the herpes simplex virus 1 infected cell protein 22 (icp22), product the
alpha22 gene, nucleotidylylated phosphorylated nuclear protein with
properties transcriptional factor required expression subset of
viral genes. here, report following. (i) icp22 interacts previously
unknown cellular factor designated p78 yeast two-hybrid system. p78
cdna encodes polypeptide distribution leucines reminiscent a
leucine zipper. (ii) uninfected infected cells, antibody p78 reacts
with two major bands apparent mr 78,000 two minor bands with
apparent mrs 62, 000 55,000. (ii) p78 also interacts icp22 vitro. 
(iii) uninfected cells, p78 dispersed largely nucleoplasm hela
cells nucleoplasm cytoplasm hep-2 cells. infection, p78
formed large dense bodies colocalize viral regulatory
protein icp0. (iv) accumulation p78 cell cycle dependent, highest
very early phase. (v) accumulation icp22 synchronized cells was
highest early phase, contrast accumulation another protein,
icp27, relatively independent cell cycle. (vi) course 
the cell cycle, icp22 transiently modified aberrant fashion, this
modification coincided expression p78. results suggest icp22
interacts may stabilized cell cycle-dependent proteins.
