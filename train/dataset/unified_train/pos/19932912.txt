paramyxovirus matrix (m) proteins organize virus assembly, functioning as
adapters link together viral ribonucleoprotein complexes viral
glycoproteins infected cell plasma membranes. proteins may also function 
recruit manipulate host factors assist virus budding, similar to
retroviral gag proteins. yeast two-hybrid screening, angiomotin-like 1
(amotl1) identified host factor interacts protein of
parainfluenza virus 5 (piv5). amotl1-m protein interaction observed yeast,
in transfected mammalian cells, virus-infected cells. binding mapped
to 83-amino acid region derived c-terminal portion amotl1.
overexpression m-binding amotl1-derived polypeptides potently inhibited
production piv5 vlps impaired virus budding. expression these
polypeptides moderately inhibited production mumps vlps, effect 
production nipah vlps. sirna-mediated depletion amotl1 protein reduced piv5
budding, suggesting interaction beneficial paramyxovirus
infection.
