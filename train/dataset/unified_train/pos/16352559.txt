yeast two-hybrid screens led identification ubc9 piasy, e2 
e3 small ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo)-conjugating enzymes, proteins
interacting capsid (ca) protein moloney murine leukemia virus.
the binding site ca ubc9 mapped deletion alanine-scanning
mutagenesis consensus motif sumoylation residues 202 220, 
binding site piasy mapped residues 114 176, directly centered on
the major homology region. expression ca tagged sumo-1 protein resulted 
in covalent transfer sumo-1 ca vivo. mutations lysine residues to
arginines near ubc9 binding site mutations piasy binding site
reduced eliminated ca sumoylation. introduction mutations the
complete viral genome blocked virus replication. mutants exhibited defects
in late stages viral gene expression virion assembly. upon infection,
the mutant viruses able carry reverse transcription synthesize
normal levels linear viral dna unable produce circular viral
dnas integrated provirus normally found nucleus. results suggest
that sumoylation ca mediated interaction ubc9 piasy is
required early events infection, reverse transcription before
nuclear entry viral dna integration.
