activation-induced cytidine deaminase (aid) essential somatic
hypermutation (shm) class-switch recombination (csr) ig genes. the
mechanism aid triggers shm csr explained two distinct
models. dna deamination model, aid converts cytidine bases dna into
uridine. uridine recognized dna repair system, produces dna
strand breakages point mutations. alternative model, rna edited aid
is responsible triggering csr shm. however, rna deamination aid has
not demonstrated. found c-to-t g-to-a mutations accumulated
in hepatitis b virus (hbv) nucleocapsid dna aid expressed in
hbv-replicating hepatic cell lines. aid expression caused c-to-t mutations the
nucleocapsid dna rnase h-defective hbv, produce plus-strand
viral dna. furthermore, rt-pcr products nucleocapsid viral rna from
aid-expressing cells exhibited significant c-to-t mutations, whereas viral rnas
outside nucleocapsid accumulate c-to-u mutations. moreover, aid was
packaged within nucleocapsid forming ribonucleoprotein complex hbv 
rna hbv polymerase protein. encapsidation aid protein with
viral rna dna provides efficient environment evaluating aid's rna 
dna deamination activities. bona fide rna-editing enzyme, apolipoprotein b mrna
editing catalytic polypeptide 1, induced similar level c-to-u mutations in
nucleocapsid rna aid. taken together, results indicate aid can
deaminate nucleocapsid rna hbv.
