hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection blocks cellular interferon (ifn)-mediated
antiviral signaling cleavage cardif hcv-ns3/4a serine protease.
like ns3/4a, ns4b protein strongly blocks ifn-β production signaling mediated 
retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i); however, underlying molecular
mechanisms well understood. recently, stimulator interferon genes 
(sting) identified activator rig-i signaling. sting possesses a
structural homology domain flaviviral ns4b, suggests direct
protein-protein interaction. present study, investigated molecular 
mechanisms ns4b targets rig-i-induced sting-mediated ifn-β
production signaling. ifn-β promoter reporter assay showed ifn-β promoter
activation induced rig-i cardif significantly suppressed ns4b
and ns3/4a, whereas sting-induced ifn-β activation suppressed ns4b not
by ns3/4a, suggesting ns4b distinct point interaction.
immunostaining showed sting colocalized ns4b endoplasmic
reticulum. immunoprecipitation bimolecular fluorescence complementation
(bifc) assays demonstrated ns4b specifically bound sting. intriguingly, ns4b
expression blocked protein interaction sting cardif, is
required robust ifn-β activation. ns4b truncation assays showed n
terminus, containing sting homology domain, necessary suppression
of ifn-β promoter activation. ns4b suppressed residual ifn-β activation an
ns3/4a-cleaved cardif (cardif1-508), suggesting ns3/4a ns4b may
cooperate blockade ifn-β production.conclusion: ns4b suppresses
rig-i-mediated ifn-β production signaling direct protein interaction
with sting. disruption interaction may restore cellular antiviral
responses may constitute novel therapeutic strategy eradication 
hcv.
