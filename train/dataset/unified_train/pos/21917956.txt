genomic dna synthesis universally conserved process herpesviruses,
including human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). hcmv ul70 believed encode the
primase dna replication machinery, function requires localization 
in nucleus, site viral dna synthesis. host factors interact
with ul70 reported. study, provide first direct evidence
that ul70 specifically interacts snapin, human protein is
predominantly localized cytoplasm associated cellular
vesicles. interaction ul70 snapin identified the
two-hybrid screen yeast coimmunoprecipitation human cells. nuclear 
import ul70 decreased cells overexpressing snapin increased in
cells expression snapin downregulated anti-snapin small 
interfering rna (sirna) molecules, respectively. furthermore, viral dna synthesis
and progeny production decreased cells overexpressing snapin and
increased anti-snapin sirna-treated cells, respectively. contrast, no
significant difference nuclear level ul70, viral dna synthesis, and
progeny production found among parental cells cells either
expressed control empty vector treated control sirna molecules
that recognize viral cellular transcripts. results suggest
that snapin may play key role regulating cellular localization ul70
in hcmv, leading modulation viral dna synthesis progeny production.
