histone deacetylation plays pivotal role regulating human cytomegalovirus
gene expression. report, identified candidate hdac1-interacting
proteins context infection using method rapid immunoisolation 
of epitope-tagged protein coupled mass spectrometry. putative interactors
included multiple human cytomegalovirus-coded proteins. particular, the
interaction pul38 pul29/28 hdac1 confirmed reciprocal
immunoprecipitations. hdac1 present numerous protein complexes, including
the hdac1-containing nucleosome remodeling deacetylase protein complex, nurd.
pul38 pul29/28 associated mta2 component nurd, shrna-mediated
knockdown rbbp4 chd4 constituents nurd inhibited hcmv
immediate-early rna viral dna accumulation; together argues that
multiple components nurd complex needed efficient hcmv
replication. consistent positive acting role nurd elements 
viral replication, growth pul29/28- pul38-deficient viruses could not
be rescued treating infected cells deacetylase inhibitor,
trichostatin a. transient expression pul29/28 enhanced activity hcmv
major immediate-early promoter reporter assay, regardless pul38
expression. importantly, induction major immediate-early reporter activity
by pul29/28 required functional nurd components, consistent inhibition
of immediate-early rna accumulation within infected cells knockdown of
rbbp4 chd4. propose pul29/28 modifies nurd complex stimulate
the accumulation immediate-early rnas.
