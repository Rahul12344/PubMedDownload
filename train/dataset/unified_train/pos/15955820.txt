during first stage varicella-zoster virus (vzv) infection, ie63 (immediate
early 63 protein) mostly expressed nucleus also slightly the
cytoplasm, latency, ie63 localizes cytoplasm quite exclusively.
because phosphorylation known regulate various cellular mechanisms, we
investigated impact phosphorylation roscovitine-sensitive
cyclin-dependent kinase (rsc) localization functional properties of
ie63. demonstrated first ie63 phosphorylated ser-224 vitro by
cdk1 cdk5 cdk2, cdk7, cdk9. furthermore, using roscovitine
and cdk1 inhibitor iii (ciiii), showed cdk1 phosphorylated ie63 on
ser-224 vivo. mutagenesis use inhibitors, demonstrated that
phosphorylation ser-224 important correct localization the
protein. indeed, substitution residues alanine led an
exclusive nuclear localization protein, whereas mutations glutamic
acid modify subcellular distribution. transfected or
vzv-infected cells treated roscovitine ciiii, exclusive nuclear
localization ie63 also observed. using transfection assay, also
showed phosphorylation ser-224 thr-222 essential the
down-regulation basal activity vzv dna polymerase gene promoter.
similarly, roscovitine ciiii impaired properties wild-type form 
of ie63. observations clearly demonstrated importance cdk1-mediated 
ie63 phosphorylation correct distribution ie63 cellular
compartments repressive activity toward promoter tested.
