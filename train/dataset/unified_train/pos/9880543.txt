heed, human homolog mouse eed drosophila esc, two members the
trithorax (trx) polycomb group (pc-g) genes, isolated screening 
activated lymphocyte cdna library versus immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) protein used bait two-hybrid system yeast. human eed 
protein (heed) 99. 5% identity mouse eed protein contained seven
wd repeats. two heed gene transcripts identified, putative
407-nucleotide-long intron, giving rise two heed protein isoforms 535 and
494 residues length, respectively. shorter heed isoform, originated from
the unspliced message, lacked seventh wd repeat. heed found bind ma
protein vitro, efficiently vivo yeast cells. site-directed
mutagenesis phage biopanning suggested interaction heed 
ma involved n-terminal region protein, including first
polybasic signal, conformation-dependent manner. heed protein,
however, two discrete linear ma-binding motifs identified within residues
388-403, overlapping origin fifth wd repeat. deletion the
c-terminal 41 residues heed, spanning seventh wd repeat, the
494-residue heed protein, detrimental heed-ma interaction vivo,
suggesting existence another c-terminal binding site and/or a
conformational role heed c-terminal domain ma-heed interaction. 
and heed proteins co-localized within nucleus co-transfected human cells
and recombinant baculovirus co-infected insect cells. failure 
heed bind uncleaved gag precursor suggested role heed early
stages virus infection, rather late virus life cycle.
