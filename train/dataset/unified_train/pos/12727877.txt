despite implication progression hepatitis b virus (hbv)-associated 
liver disease, pro-apoptotic function hbx protein remains poorly
understood. show expression hbx leads hyperactivation of
caspase-8 caspase-3 upon treatment tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(tnf-alpha) anti-fas antibody, activation correlated the
sensitivity apoptosis. demonstrate cytoplasmic co-localization direct
interaction hbx cellular flice inhibitory protein (c-flip), key
regulator death-inducing signaling complex (disc). deletion analysis shows
that death effector domain 1 (ded1) c-flip important observed
interaction. overexpression c-flip rescued cells hbx-mediated
apoptosis, full-length hbv genome hbx expression vectors.
moreover, c-flip caspase-8 inhibitor considerably protected cells from
hbx-mediated apoptosis. data suggest hbx abrogates the
apoptosis-inhibitory function c-flip renders cell hypersensitive
towards tnf-alpha apoptotic signal even threshold concentration. this
provides novel mechanism deregulation hepatic cell growth hbv
patients new target intervention hbv-associated liver cancer and
disease.
