cellular proteins implicated important hiv-1 reverse
transcription, whether reverse transcription complex (rtc) cofactors 
or affect reverse transcription indirectly unclear. used protein
fractionation combined endogenous reverse transcription assay identify
cellular proteins stimulated late steps reverse transcription vitro.
we identified 25 cellular proteins active protein fraction, we
show eef1a eef1g subunits eukaryotic elongation factor 1 (eef1)
are important components hiv-1 rtc. eef1a eef1g identified in
fractionated human t-cell lysates reverse transcription cofactors, their
removal ablated ability active protein fractions stimulate late reverse
transcription vitro. observed p51 subunit reverse transcriptase
and integrase, two subunits rtc, coimmunoprecipitated eef1a and
eef1g. moreover eef1a eef1g associated purified rtcs colocalized
with reverse transcriptase following infection cells. reverse transcription in
cells sharply down-regulated eef1a eef1g levels reduced sirna
treatment result reduced levels rtcs treated cells. combined
evidence indicates eef1 subunits critical rtc stability cofactors 
required efficient completion reverse transcription. identification of
eef1 subunits unique rtc components provides basis further
investigations reverse transcription trafficking rtc the
nucleus.
