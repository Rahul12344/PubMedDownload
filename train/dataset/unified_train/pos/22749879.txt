the human polyomavirus jc (jcv) causative agent cns demyelinating
disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). infection jcv is
extremely common primary infection, jcv persists latent state.
however, pml rare disease suggesting virus tightly
regulated. previously, showed nf-κb c/ebpβ regulate jcv early and
late promoters via dna control element, kb, also mediates stimulatory
effects proinflammatory cytokines tnf-α jcv gene expression. 
studies implicated nfat4 jcv regulation. report nfat4 and
nf-κb interact kb element co-operatively activate jcv early and
late transcription viral dna replication. interplay inhibited by
c/ebpβ agents block calcineurin/nfat signaling pathway. the
importance events regulation jcv latency reactivation is
discussed.
