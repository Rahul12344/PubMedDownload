the human papillomavirus (hpv) life cycle tightly linked differentiation of
the squamous epithelia infects. capsid proteins, hence mature
virions, produced outermost layer differentiated cells. late
gene transcripts produced lower layers, posttranscriptional mechanisms
likely prevent capsid protein production less differentiated cells. hpv
type 16 (hpv-16), 79-nucleotide (nt) negative regulatory element (nre) inhibits
gene expression basal epithelial cells. identify key nre sequences, we
carried transient transfection basal epithelial cells reporter
constructs containing hpv-16 late 3' untranslated region deletions and
mutations nre. reporter gene expression increased 40-fold by
deletion entire element, 10-fold deletion 5' portion nre 
that contains four weak consensus 5' splice sites, 3-fold deletion of
the 3' gu-rich region. portions element appear necessary for
full repression. inactivating mutations 5' splice sites 5' nre
partially alleviated repression context 79-nt nre caused full
derepression assayed construct 3' nre deleted. four
contribute inhibitory effect, though second splice site most
inhibitory. sm proteins, u1a u1 snrna, u1 70k, could affinity
purified wild-type nre nre containing mutations 
5' splice sites, indicating u1 snrnp-like complex forms upon element.
