the pre-s mutant lhbs, especially pre-s2 type, believed crucial in
hbv-associated hepatocellular carcinogenesis. however, mechanism of
hbv-induced hepatocellular carcinoma fully understood. identify the
mechanism, pre-s2 lhbs-interacting proteins studied, performing yeast
two-hybrid screen human liver cdna library. screening library
resulted isolation several positive clones. sequencing positive 
clones identified full-length cdna c53 gene. identiﬁcation of
the interaction, roles lhbs cdk1, chk1 activation mitotic entry
were studied. screening library resulted isolation several
positive clones, encoded full-length cdna c53 gene. found that
c53 interacts pre-s2 lhbs vitro in vivo, lhbs or
other mutants. binding pre-s2 lhbs c53 causes increased cdk1
activation mitotic entry, function chk1 partially inhibited 
the binding pre-s2 lhbs c53. taken together, results strongly suggest
that binding pre-s2 lhbs c53 novel negative regulator the
checkpoint response. counteracting c53, pre-s2 lhbs promotes cdk1 activation
and mitotic entry unperturbed cell cycle progression delays function
of chk1, may novel potential mechanism hbv-induced hepatocellular 
carcinoma (hcc).
