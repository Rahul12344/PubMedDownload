the highly conserved encapsidation signal (epsilon) hepatitis b viral (hbv)
pregenomic rna reported essential component encapsidation 
protein priming hbv polymerase. here, report two hbv epsilon
rna-binding host proteins (80 43 kda) copurifying protein (100 kda)
were purified characterized combined methods uv cross-linking
analysis epsilon rna column chromatography. amino-terminal
microsequencing showed 80- 43-kda proteins identified the
heterodimeric nuclear factor activated cells (nf90/nf45) 100 kda a
molecular chaperone, grp94. heterodimeric factor interacted
preferentially upper-bulge region hbv epsilon rna helping hbv
polymerase bind lower-bulge region. using vitro protein priming analysis, 
the initial oligonucleotide protein-priming product deduced as
5'-gaac-3', complementary sequence regions dr1 and
epsilon pregenomic rna. previously, also proposed grp94 was
associated hbv polymerase human liver cell hepg2. results
suggest heterodimeric factor plays important role priming
activity hbv polymerase.
