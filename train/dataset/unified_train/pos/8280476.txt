ets multigene family members share common ets dna-binding domain. 
ets proteins activate transcription via binding purine-rich ggaa core
sequence located promoters/enhancers various genes, including several 
are transcriptionally active cells. ets1, ets2, erbg/hu-fli-1 gene
expression pattern also suggests role genes cells hematopoietic
lineage. hiv-1 ltr core enhancer contains two 10-base pair direct repeat
sequences (left right) required regulation hiv-1 mrna
expression host transcription factors, including nf kappa b. two ets-binding
sites present core enhancer hiv-1 isolates reported far.
in studies, utilized hiv-1 hxb2 hiv-1 z2z6 core enhancers 
z2z6 strain single point mutation flanking right ets-binding site. we
demonstrate ets1, ets2, ergb/hu-fli-1 proteins trans-activate
transcription hxb2 z2z6 core enhancer linked reporter
(cat) gene. addition, show dna binding trans-activation with
the z2z6 core enhancer least 40-fold higher observed the
hxb2 core enhancer. further, provide evidence marked increase in
binding trans-activation z2z6 core enhancer sequences due the
substitution flanking residue hxb2 tggaa) c residue z2z6
(cggaa) isolate, thus generating optimal ets-binding core (cggaa) sequence.
