all lentiviruses oncoretroviruses examined far encode major nucleic-acid
binding protein (nucleocapsid nc* protein), approximately 2500 molecules of
which coat dimeric rna genome. studies hiv-1 momulv using vitro
model systems vivo shown nc protein required chaperone
viral rna dimerization packaging virus assembly, proviral dna
synthesis reverse transcriptase (rt) infection. human cellular
prion protein (prp), thought major component agent causing
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (tse), recently found possess 
strong affinity nucleic acids exhibit chaperone properties very
similar hiv-1 nc protein hiv-1 context vitro. tight binding prp
to nucleic acids proposed participate directly prion disease
process. extend understanding lentiviruses unexpected
nucleic acid chaperone properties human prion protein, set in
vitro system investigate replication feline immunodeficiency virus
(fiv), functionally phylogenetically distant hiv-1. results
show fiv model system, nc protein chaperones viral rna dimerization, 
primer trna(lys,3) annealing genomic primer-binding site (pbs) minus
strand dna synthesis homologous fiv rt. fiv nc protein able trigger 
specific viral dna synthesis inhibiting self-priming reverse transcription.
the human prion protein found mimic properties fiv nc respect 
to primer trna annealing viral rna chaperoning minus strand dna
synthesis.
