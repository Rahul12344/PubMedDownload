a subset cellular dna hairpins double-strand breaks processed by
dna-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (dna-pkcs)- artemis-associated
endonuclease. dna hairpin termini adeno-associated virus (aav) processed
by dna repair machinery; however, cellular factors involved in
the process remain elusive. here, show dna-pkcs artemis open aav
inverted terminal repeat (itr) hairpin loops tissue-dependent manner. we
investigated recombinant aav (raav) genome metabolism various tissues of
dna-pkcs- artemis-proficient -deficient mice. absence either
factor, itr hairpin opening impaired, resulting accumulation of
double-stranded linear raav genomes capped covalently closed hairpins at
termini. 5' end 3-base hairpin loops itr primary target for
dna-pkcs- artemis-mediated cleavage. muscle, heart, kidney,
dna-pkcs- artemis-dependent hairpin opening constituted significant
pathway, liver, undefined alternative pathways effectively processed
hairpins. addition, study revealed holliday junction resolvase-like
activity liver cleaved t-shaped itr hairpin shoulders making nicks
at diametrically opposed sites. thus, approach furthers understanding 
not raav biology also fundamental dna repair systems various tissues 
of living animals.
