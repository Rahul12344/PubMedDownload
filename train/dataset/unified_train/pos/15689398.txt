primate genomes encode variety innate immune strategies defend themselves
against retroviruses. one these, trim5alpha, restrict diverse retroviruses
in species-specific manner. thus, whereas rhesus trim5alpha strongly
restrict hiv-1, human trim5alpha weak hiv-1 restriction. biology 
trim5alpha restriction suggests locked antagonistic conflict
with proteins encoding viral capsid. antagonistic interactions
frequently result rapid amino acid replacements protein-protein
interface, genetic entity vies evolutionary dominance. analyzing
its evolutionary history, find strong evidence ancient positive selection 
in primate trim5alpha gene. selection strikingly variable some
of strongest selection occurring human lineage. history suggests 
that trim5alpha evolution driven antagonistic interactions a
wide variety viruses endogenous retroviruses predate origin of
primate lentiviruses. 13-aa "patch" spry protein domain bears dense
concentration positively selected residues, potentially implicating an
antiviral interface. using functional studies chimeric trim5alpha genes, we
show patch generally essential retroviral restriction is
responsible species-specific antiretroviral restriction activity.
our study highlights power evolutionary analyses, positive
selection identifies age genetic conflict also the
interaction interface conflict plays out.
