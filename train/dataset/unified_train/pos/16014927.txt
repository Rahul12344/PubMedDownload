during lytic infections, virion host shutoff (vhs) protein herpes simplex 
virus accelerates degradation host viral mrnas. doing, it
helps redirect cell host viral protein synthesis facilitates 
sequential expression different viral genes. vhs interacts cellular
translation initiation factor eif4h, several point mutations abolish its
mrna degradative activity also abrogate ability bind eif4h. addition, a
complex containing bacterially expressed vhs glutathione s-transferase
(gst)-eif4h fusion protein rnase activity. eif4h shares region sequence 
homology eif4b, appears functionally similar both
stimulate rna helicase activity eif4a, component mrna cap-binding
complex eif4f. show eif4h interacts physically eif4a yeast
two-hybrid system gst pull-down assays two proteins be
coimmunoprecipitated mammalian cells. vhs also interacts eif4a gst
pull-down coimmunoprecipitation assays. site-directed mutagenesis vhs 
eif4h revealed residues important mutual interaction, 
but interaction eif4a. thus, vhs, eif4h, eif4a comprise 
group proteins, able interact directly two.
whether interact simultaneously tripartite complex sequentially is
unclear. data suggest mechanism linking degradation mrna to
its translation targeting vhs mrnas regions translation
initiation.
