ns1 protein non-structural protein encoded influenza virus, 
and contributes significantly disease pathogenesis modulating many virus
and host cell processes. two-hybrid screen proteins interact ns1 
from influenza yielded growth arrest-specific protein 8. gas8 associated with
ns1 vitro vivo. deletion analysis revealed n-terminal 260
amino acids gas8 able interact ns1, neither rna-binding
domain effector domain ns1 sufficient ns1 interaction. 
also found actin, myosin, drebrin interact gas8. ns1 beta-actin
proteins could co-immunoprecipitated extracts transfected cells.
furthermore, actin gas8 co-localized plasma membrane. results
are discussed relation possible functions gas8 protein their
relevance influenza virus release.
