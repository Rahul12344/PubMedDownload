several large dna viruses encode bcl-2 protein homologues involved the
regulation cellular apoptosis cascade. regulation often involves 
interaction viral proteins diverse cellular bcl-2 family members.
we identified specific interactions a179l, african swine fever
virus (asfv) bcl-2 homologue, active forms porcine bh3-only bid
protein (truncated bid p13 p15). transient expression asfv a179l gene in
vero cells prevented apoptosis induced active forms bid protein.
interestingly, a179l protein able interact, also main core bcl-2 
proapoptotic proteins bax bak, several bh3-only proteins with
selective binding restrictions full length bid noxa. results
suggest fine regulation a179l action suppression apoptosis in
infected cells essential efficient virus replication.
