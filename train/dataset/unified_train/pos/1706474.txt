soluble, monomeric simian virus 40 (sv40) small-t antigen (small-t) purified 
from bacteria assayed ability form complexes protein
phosphatase 2a (pp2a) modify catalytic activity. different forms of
purified pp2a, composed combinations regulatory subunits (a b) a
common catalytic subunit (c), used. forms used included free c
subunits ac abc complexes. small-t associated free a
subunit ac form pp2a, resulting shift mobility during
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. small-t interact with
the free c subunit abc form. data demonstrate primary
interaction small-t subunit b subunit pp2a
blocks interaction small-t ac form. effect small-t on
phosphatase activity determined using several exogenous substrates,
including myosin light chains phosphorylated myosin light-chain kinase, myelin
basic protein phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein 2 kinase/erk1, and
histone h1 phosphorylated protein kinase c. exception histone h1, 
small-t inhibited dephosphorylation substrates ac complex.
with histone h1, small stimulation dephosphorylation ac observed.
small-t effect activities free c abc complex. maximum
of 50 75% inhibition obtained, half-maximal inhibition occurring at
10 20 nm small-t. specific activity small-t/ac complex similar 
to abc form pp2a myosin light chains histone h1 the
substrate. results suggested small-t b subunit similar
qualitative quantitative effects pp2a enzyme activity. data show
that sv40 small-antigen binds purified pp2a vitro, interaction with
the subunit, interaction inhibits enzyme activity.
