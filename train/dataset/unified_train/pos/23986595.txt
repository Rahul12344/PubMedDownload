hepatitis c virus (hcv) orchestrates different stages life cycle in
time space sequential participation hcv proteins cellular 
machineries; hence, represent tractable molecular host targets hcv
elimination combination therapies. recently identified multifunctional
y-box-binding protein 1 (yb-1 ybx1) interacting partner ns3/4a
protein hcv genomic rna negatively regulates equilibrium between
viral translation/replication particle production. identify novel host
factors regulate production infectious particles, elucidated the
yb-1 interactome human hepatoma cells quantitative mass spectrometry
approach. identified 71 yb-1-associated proteins included previously
reported hcv regulators ddx3, heterogeneous nuclear rnp a1, ilf2. the
potential yb-1 interactors, 26 proteins significantly modulated hcv replication
in gene-silencing screening. following extensive interaction functional
validation, identified three yb-1 partners, c1qbp, larp-1, igf2bp2, that
redistribute surface core-containing lipid droplets hcv
jfh-1-expressing cells, similarly yb-1 ddx6. importantly, knockdown of
these proteins stimulated release and/or egress hcv particles without
affecting virus assembly, suggesting functional yb-1 protein complex that
negatively regulates virus production. furthermore, jfh-1 strain ns3
q221l mutation, promotes virus production, less sensitive this
negative regulation, suggesting hcv-specific yb-1 protein complex
modulates ns3-dependent step virus production. overall, data support 
model hcv hijacks host cell machinery containing numerous rna-binding
proteins control equilibrium viral rna replication and
ns3-dependent late steps particle production.
