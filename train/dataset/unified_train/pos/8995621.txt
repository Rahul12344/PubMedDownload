the herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1)-infected cell protein 0 (icp0) a
promiscuous transactivator, necessity, functions must mediated
through cellular gene products. attempt identify cellular factors
interacting icp0, used carboxyl-terminal domain icp0 "bait" 
the yeast (saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system. results as
follows: (i) 43 cdnas positive yeast colonies found encode the
same translation factor, elongation factor delta-1 (ef-1delta). (ii) purified
chimeric protein consisting glutathione s-transferase (gst) fused ef-1delta
specifically formed complexes icp0 contained hsv-1-infected cell lysate. 
(iii) fractionation infected hep-2 cells immunofluorescence studies
revealed icp0 localized nucleus cytoplasm. in
primary human foreskin fibroblasts, icp0 localized predominantly the
cytoplasm throughout hsv-1 infection even early infection. (iv) addition of
the chimeric protein gst-carboxyl-terminal domain icp0 rabbit
reticulocyte lysate vitro translation system resulted dose-dependent
decrease protein synthesis. contrast, gst alone gst fused the
amino-terminal domain icp0 effect vitro translation system.
(v) predominant forms ef-1delta electrophoresis denaturing gels have
apparent mrs 38,000 40,000. higher-mr form minor species in
mock-infected cells, whereas human fibroblasts vero cells infected with
hsv-1, isoform becomes dominant. results indicate icp0 present
and may significant role cytoplasm infected cells, possibly by
altering efficiency translation viral mrnas.
