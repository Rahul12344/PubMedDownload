human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (hiv-1) vpr highly conserved gene among
lentiviruses. diverse functions vpr support interactions hiv
accessory protein host cell partners important pathways. hvip/mov34
(human vpr interacting protein) one identified vpr ligands. hvip a
34-kda member eif3 family vital early embryonic development in
transgenic mice important cell cycle regulation. interaction vpr,
however, yet clearly defined. therefore, constructed panel of
deletion mutants cytoplasmic cellular ligand map protein domain
that mediates interaction vpr. observed carboxyl-terminal
region hvip critical interaction vpr. absence vpr or
hiv infection, full-length hvip expressed cytoplasm. cytoplasmic
localization pattern full-length hvip protein, however, shifted clear 
nuclear localization pattern cells expressing hvip vpr. contrast, 
vpr alter localization pattern hvip mutants, their
carboxyl-terminal domain deleted. movement hvip supported prior work 
suggested vpr triggers activation gr receptor complex. fact, we
also observed dexamethasone moves hvip nucleus that
glucocorticoid antagonists inhibit effect. interestingly, expression 
an hvip carboxyl-terminal mutant, responsive vpr, also not
responsive dexamethasone. data illustrate carboxyl-terminal
domain hvip critical mediating hvip-vpr interaction well 
glucocorticoid response. results support view hvip member 
the complex array nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins regulated by
hiv infection glucocorticoids.
