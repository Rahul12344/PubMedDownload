most paramyxoviruses circumvent ifn response blocking ifn signaling and
limiting production ifn virus-infected cells. report the
highly conserved cysteine-rich c-terminal domain v proteins wide
variety paramyxoviruses binds melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5
(mda-5) product. mda-5 ifn-inducible host cell dexd/h box helicase that
contains caspase recruitment domain n terminus. overexpression mda-5 
stimulated basal activity ifn-beta promoter reporter gene assays
and significantly enhanced activation ifn-beta promoter by
intracellular dsrna. activities repressed coexpression 
v proteins simian virus 5, human parainfluenza virus 2, mumps virus, sendai
virus, hendra virus. similar results reporter assays obtained 
measuring ifn production. inhibition mda-5 rna interference dominant 
interfering forms mda-5 significantly inhibited activation ifn-beta
promoter dsrna. thus appears mda-5 plays central role an
intracellular signal transduction pathway lead activation 
ifn-beta promoter, v proteins paramyxoviruses interact mda-5
to block activity.
