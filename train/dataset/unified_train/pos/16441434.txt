local activation src plasma membrane extracellular vaccinia virus
results signalling cascade acts stimulate actin polymerization
beneath virus enhance cell-to-cell spread. initiation this
signalling cascade involves src-mediated phosphorylation tyrosine 112 132 
of viral membrane protein a36r. show recruitment src is
dependent myristoylation interaction a36r upstream tyrosine
112 132. show src, fyn yes unique specificities
towards tyrosine residues. using cell lines deficient src, fyn yes, 
we demonstrate multiple src family members stimulate vaccinia-induced
actin polymerization also uncover role abl family kinases.
additionally, abl arg able phosphorylate a36r vitro are
recruited vaccinia-induced actin tails. ability multiple families of
tyrosine kinases directly phosphorylate a36r ensures robust cell-to-cell
spread vaccinia virus occur variety cellular conditions.
