human noroviruses one major causes acute gastroenteritis the
developed world, yet understanding molecular mechanisms genome
translation replication lags behind many rna viruses. due the
nonculturable nature human noroviruses, many related members the
caliciviridae family small rna viruses often used model systems to
dissect finer details norovirus life cycle. murine norovirus (mnv) has
provided one system study basic mechanisms norovirus
translation replication cell culture. report describe use
of riboproteomics identify host factors interact extremities 
the mnv genome. network rna-protein interactions contains many
well-characterized host factors, including ptb, la, ddx3, been
shown play role life cycle rna viruses. using rna
coimmunoprecipitation, confirmed number factors identified using
riboproteomics associated viral rna virus replication cell
culture. demonstrated rna inhibition-mediated knockdown the
intracellular levels number factors inhibits slows norovirus
replication cell culture, allowing identification new intracellular targets
for important group pathogens.
