influenza virus non-structural protein 1 (ns1) important viral
regulatory factor controls cellular processes facilitate viral
replication. gain insight role ns1, tried find novel
cellular factors interact ns1. complexes ns1 target proteins
were pulled infected cell lysate using anti-ns1 (a/udorn/72)
single-chain fv identified peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. we
identified nucleolin, multifunctional major nucleolar protein, novel
ns1-binding protein. rna-binding domain ns1 responsible this
binding, judged gst (glutathione s-transferase) pull-down assay 
gst-fused functional domains ns1. laser confocal microscopy, observed
the co-localization ns1 nucleolin clearly nucleoli,
indicating ns1 interacting nucleolin infection. results
suggest novel function ns1, namely, affecting cellular events via
interaction nucleolin.
