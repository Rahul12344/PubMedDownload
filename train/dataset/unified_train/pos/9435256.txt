the human t-cell leukemia virus (htlv) associated adult cell leukemia
and neurological disorders (tsp/ham). htlv transcriptional transactivator,
tax, known exert effect protein-protein interaction with
several transcription factors activate genes cell proliferation. the
pathogenic mechanism cns less defined. using yeast two-hybrid
system, identified specific tax-binding protein neuronal
specific intermediate filament protein, alpha-internexin. tax binds domain
corresponding rod region alpha-internexin, essential for
neurofilament assembly. tax domains involved binding separable from
those involved transactivation. txbp-1/alpha-internexin tax expressed 
in cytoplasm nucleus, respectively, expressed alone, in
coexpressing cells, colocalization proteins observed a
perinuclear, punctate distribution. vivo interaction also resulted a
dramatic reduction tax transactivation network formation by
alpha-internexin. specific interaction tax neuronal specific
intermediate filament protein may provide clue pathogenesis tsp/ham.
