checkpoint kinase 2 (chk2) known mediate diverse cellular responses to
genotoxic stress. fundamental role chk2 regulate network of
genome-surveillance pathways coordinate cell-cycle progression dna
repair cell survival death. defects chk2 contribute development 
of hereditary sporadic human cancers. present evidence the
human t-cell leukemia virus type-1 (htlv-1) tax protein directly interacts with
chk2 kinase activity chk2 inhibited tax. physical
interaction chk2 tax observed co-immunoprecipitation assays in
htlv-1-infected cells (c81) well gst pull-down assays using purified
proteins. binding kinase activity inhibition studies tax deletion
mutants indicated least two domains tax mediate interaction with
chk2. analysed functional consequence de novo expression tax
upon cellular dna-damage-induced apoptosis, mediated chk2. using 
transient transfection tunel assay, found gamma-irradiation-induced
apoptosis decreased 293t hct-116 (p53(-/-)) cells expressing htlv-1
tax. studies demonstrate important potential target tax cellular
transformation.
