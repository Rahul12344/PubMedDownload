chronic hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection frequently leads liver cancer. to
determine viral factor(s) potentially involved viral persistence, we
focused work ns2, viral protein unknown function. assign role
for ns2, searched cellular proteins interact ns2. performing a
two-hybrid screen human liver cdna library, found ns2 interacted
with liver-specific pro-apoptotic cide-b protein. binding specificity ns2 
for cide-b confirmed cell-free assays associated colocalization
studies coprecipitation experiments human endogenous cide-b. cide-b, a
member novel cide family apoptosis-inducing factors, reported 
to show strong cell death-inducing activity c-terminal domain. show
that cide-b killing domain involved ns2 interaction. ns2 binding
was sufficient inhibit cide-b-induced apoptosis ns2 deletion mutant
unable interact cide-b vitro lost capacity interfere with
cide-b cell death activity. although reported cide-b-induced
apoptosis characterized mitochondrial localization, precise apoptotic
mechanism remained unknown. here, show cide-b induced cell death a
caspase-dependent manner cytochrome c release mitochondria.
furthermore, found ns2 counteracted cytochrome c release induced by
cide-b. vivo, cide-b protein level extremely low in
adenovirus-infected transgenic mice expressing hcv polyprotein compared 
that wild-type mice. suggest ns2 interferes cide-b-induced
death pathway participates hcv strategies subvert host cell defense.
