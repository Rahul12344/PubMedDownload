we previously reported, transfected cells human t-cell leukemia
virus type-2 subtype b infected cells, viral transactivator tax-2b
protein could inhibit p53 functions. investigated mechanism
through tax-2b represses p53 using gfptax-2b fusion proteins. present
evidence tax-2b inhibition p53 function linked creb/atf
activation, uniquely correlated interaction creb binding
protein (cbp), p300, c-terminus tax-2b. wild type, 
tax-2b-m47 mutant, inhibits p53 function adherent cells. demonstrate that
both tax-2b tax-2b-m47 bind p300, tax-2b-m47 impaired cbp
binding. importantly, transfection increasing amounts cbp p300 or
p300/cbp-associated factor (p/caf) could rescue p53 transcriptional activity in
the presence tax-2b nonlymphocytic cells. lymphoid cells, tax-2b
mediated inhibition p53 correlated nf-kappab pathway activation
and could prevented overexpression ikappabalpha mutant. given the
similarities functional domains cbp p300, results are
intriguing suggest tax-2b must bind cr2 domain cbp, 
of p300 order repress p53.
