similar positive-sense, single-stranded rna viruses, hepatitis c virus
(hcv) replicates genome remodeled intracellular membranous structure
known membranous web (mw). date, process mw formation remains
unclear. generally acknowledged hcv nonstructural protein 4b (ns4b)
can induce mw formation interaction cytosolic endoplasmic
reticulum (er) membrane. many host proteins, phosphatidylinositol
4-kinase iiiα (pi4kiiiα), identified critical factors required for
this process. report new factor, cytosolic phospholipase a2 gamma
(pla2g4c), contributes mw formation, hcv replication, assembly. 
pla2g4c gene identified host gene upregulated expression upon hcv
infection. knockdown pla2g4c hcv-infected cells hcv replicon-containing 
cells small interfering rna (sirna) significantly suppressed hcv replication
and assembly. addition, chemical inhibitor methyl arachidonyl
fluorophosphonate (mafp), specifically inhibits pla2, reduced hcv
replication assembly. electron microscopy demonstrated mw structure
formation defective pla2g4c knockdown hcv replicon-containing cells.
further analysis immunostaining immunoprecipitation assays indicated 
pla2g4c colocalized hcv proteins ns4b ns5a cells infected with
jfh-1 interacted ns4b. addition, pla2g4c able transport the
hcv nonstructural proteins replication sites lipid droplets, site for
hcv assembly. data suggest pla2g4c plays important role hcv 
life cycle might represent potential target anti-hcv therapy.
