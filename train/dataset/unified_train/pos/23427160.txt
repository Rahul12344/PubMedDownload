hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 5b (ns5b) rna-dependent rna
polymerase (rdrp) acts key player hcv replication complex.
understanding interplay viral cellular components hcv 
replication complex could provide new insight prevention progression
of hcv-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). study, ns5b protein
was used bait pulldown assay screen ns5b-interacting proteins 
that present huh7 hepatoma cell lysates. mass spectrophotometric
analysis, fatty acid synthase (fasn) found interact ns5b.
coimmunoprecipitation double staining assays confirmed direct
binding ns5b fasn. domain ns5b interacts fasn was
also determined. moreover, fasn associated detergent-resistant lipid
rafts colocalized ns5b active hcv replication complexes. addition,
overexpression fasn enhanced hcv expression huh7/rep-feo cells, while
transfection fasn small interfering rna (sirna) treatment with
fasn-specific inhibitors decreased hcv replication viral production. notably,
fasn directly increased hcv ns5b rdrp activity vitro. results together
indicate fasn interacts ns5b modulates hcv replication a
direct increase ns5b rdrp activity. fasn may thereby serve target the
treatment hcv infection prevention hcv-associated hcc progression.
