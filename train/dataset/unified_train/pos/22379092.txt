the kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) lana protein functions in
latently infected cells essential participant kshv genome replication
and driver dysregulated cell growth. identify novel lana protein-cell 
protein interactions could contribute activities, performed a
proteomic screen purified, adenovirus-expressed flag-lana protein was
incubated array displaying 4,192 nonredundant human proteins. sixty-one
interacting cell proteins consistently detected. lana interactions with
high-mobility group at-hook 1 (hmga1), hmgb1, telomeric repeat binding factor 1
(trf1), xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group (xpa), pygopus homolog 2
(pygo2), protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a)b subunit, tat-interactive protein 60
(tip60), replication protein a1 (rpa1), rpa2 proteins confirmed in
coimmunoprecipitation assays. lana-associated tip60 retained acetyltransferase
activity and, unlike human papillomavirus e6 hiv-1 tat proteins, lana not
reduce tip60 stability. lana-bound pp2a b subunit associated the
pp2a subunit catalytic c subunit, suggesting disruption pp2a
phosphatase activity. reminiscent role simian virus 40 (sv40)
small antigen. chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays showed binding of
rpa1 rpa2 kshv terminal repeats. interestingly, lana expression
ablated rpa1 rpa2 binding cell telomeric repeats. u2os cells that
rely alternative mechanism telomere maintenance, lana expression had
minimal effect telomere length. however, lana expression telomerase
immortalized endothelial cells resulted telomere shortening. kshv-infected 
cells, telomere shortening may one mechanism lana contributes to
the development malignancy.
