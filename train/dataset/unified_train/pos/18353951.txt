the herpes simplex virus ul56 gene conserved among members the
alphaherpesvirinae family plays critical role viral pathogenicity in
vivo. hsv-2 ul56 protein (ul56) c-terminally anchored type ii membrane
protein predicted inserted virion envelope, leaving its
n-terminal domain tegument. ul56 interacts kif1a ul11. we
report ul56 also interacts ubiquitin ligase nedd4 increases its
ubiquitination. nedd4 identified ul56-interacting protein yeast
two-hybrid screen. ul56 bound nedd4 via py motifs. nedd4 was
phosphorylated degraded wild-type hsv-2-infected cells cells
infected ul56-deficient mutant. ubiquitination assays revealed ul56
increased ubiquitinated nedd4, actively degraded infected cells.
ul56 also caused decrease nedd4 protein levels increased
ubiquitination cotransfected cells. however, ul56 not
ubiquitinated, despite interaction nedd4. based findings, we
propose ul56 regulates nedd4 hsv-2-infected cells, although deletion of
ul56 apparent effect viral growth vitro.
