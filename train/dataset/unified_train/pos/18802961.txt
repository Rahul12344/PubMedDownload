hepatocyte tight junctions (tj) play key roles characteristic liver functions,
including bile formation secretion. infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) may 
cause alterations liver architecture disruption bile duct,
which ultimately lead cholestasis. herein, employed hcv replicon
system analyze effect hcv tj organization. tj-associated proteins
occludin, claudin-1, zonula occludens protein-1 (zo-1) disappeared their
normal localization border adjacent cells huh7 clones harboring
genomic subgenomic replicons expressing nonstructural proteins. 
furthermore, cells containing genomic replicons showed cytoplasmic accumulation
of occludin endoplasmic reticulum (er). tj-associated function, measured
as fitc-dextran paracellular permeability, genomic replicon-containing cells, 
was also altered. interestingly, clearance hcv replicon by
interferon-alpha (ifn-alpha) treatment short hairpin rna (shrna)
significantly restored localization tj-associated proteins. transient
expression hcv structural proteins, core protein alone, altered
the localization tj-associated proteins huh7 cells clones with
subgenomic replicons. confocal analysis showed accumulation occludin in
the er partially co-localized hcv envelope glycoprotein e2. e2/occludin
association confirmed co-immunoprecipitation pull-down assays.
additionally, using cell culture model hcv infection, observed the
cytoplasmic dot-like accumulation occludin infected huh7 cells.conclusion: 
we propose hcv structural proteins, likely viral envelope,
promote alterations tj-associated proteins, may provide new insights for
hcv-related pathogenesis.
