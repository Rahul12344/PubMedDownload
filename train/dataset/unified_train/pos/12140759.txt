the e6 proteins high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) types have
previously shown target number pdz domain-containing proteins for
proteasome-mediated degradation. include hdlg tumour suppressor the
magi-1 protein. study show high-risk hpv e6 proteins also target 
the related magi-2 magi-3 proteins degradation. moreover, show that
the interaction specific one pdz domain, co-expression this
domain protect full-length magi proteins e6-mediated
degradation. data provide clear indicators potential design of
compounds could specifically inhibit interaction oncogenic hpv e6
proteins important class target proteins.
