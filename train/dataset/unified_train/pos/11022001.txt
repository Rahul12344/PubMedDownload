hepatitis c virus (hcv) major human pathogen causing mild severe liver
disease worldwide remarkably efficient establishing persistent
infections. previously, shown core protein an
immunomodulatory function including suppression lymphocyte responses 
viral infection. investigate underlying mechanism role core
protein immune modulation, examined effect core sensitivity
of human cell line, jurkat, fas-mediated apoptosis. transient and
stable expression core protein jurkat cells increased sensitivity of
cells fas-mediated apoptosis compared control cells expressing vector 
dna alone. addition, demonstrated core protein binds the
cytoplasmic domain fas may enhance downstream signaling event of
fas-mediated apoptosis. expression core protein alter cell
surface expression fas, indicating increased sensitivity of
core-expressing cells fas ligand due upregulation fas.
furthermore, observed augmentation caspase-3 activity in
core-expressing cells. results suggest core protein may promote
the apoptosis immune cells hcv infection via fas signaling pathway,
thus facilitating hcv persistence.
