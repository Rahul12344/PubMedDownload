coronaviruses contain positive-sense single-stranded genomic (g) rna, which
encodes nonstructural proteins. several subgenomic mrnas (sgmrnas) encoding
structural proteins generated template switching body
transcription regulatory sequence (trs) leader trs. process
preferentially generates shorter sgmrna. appropriate readthrough body trss 
required produce longer sgmrnas full-length grna. find that
phosphorylation viral nucleocapsid (n) host glycogen synthase kinase-3 
(gsk-3) required template switching. gsk-3 inhibition selectively reduces 
the generation grna longer sgmrnas, shorter sgmrnas. n
phosphorylation allows recruitment rna helicase ddx1 the
phosphorylated-n-containing complex, facilitates template readthrough and
enables longer sgmrna synthesis. ddx1 knockdown loss helicase activity
markedly reduces levels longer sgmrnas. thus, coronaviruses employ a
unique strategy transition discontinuous continuous transcription
to ensure balanced sgmrnas full-length grna synthesis.
