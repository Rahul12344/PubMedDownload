a proteome-wide mapping interactions hepatitis c virus (hcv) human
proteins performed provide comprehensive view cellular infection.
a total 314 protein-protein interactions hcv human proteins was
identified yeast two-hybrid 170 literature mining. integration 
data set reconstructed human interactome showed cellular proteins
interacting hcv enriched highly central interconnected proteins. 
a global analysis basis functional annotation highlighted the
enrichment cellular pathways targeted hcv. network proteins associated
with frequent clinical disorders chronically infected patients constructed
by connecting insulin, jak/stat tgfbeta pathways cellular proteins
targeted hcv. core protein appeared major perturbator network.
focal adhesion identified new function affected hcv, mainly ns3
and ns5a proteins.
