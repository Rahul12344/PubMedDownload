the human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) 72-kda immediate-early 1 (ie1) protein is
thought modulate cellular antiviral functions impacting promyelocytic
leukemia (pml) nuclear bodies signal transducer activator of
transcription (stat) signaling. ie1 consists four distinct regions: an
amino-terminal region required nuclear localization, large central
hydrophobic region responsible pml targeting transactivation activity, an
acidic domain, carboxyl-terminal chromatin tethering domain. found 
the acidic domain ie1 required binding stat2. mutant hcmv encoding
ie1(delta421-475) acidic domain deleted generated. mutant
virus-infected cells, ie1(delta421-475) failed bind stat2. growth of
mutant virus slightly delayed high multiplicity infection (moi) 
but severely impaired low moi low-level accumulation viral
proteins. cells pretreated beta interferon, mutant virus
showed additional 1,000-fold reduction viral growth, even high moi,
compared wild type. inhibition stat2 loading target promoter
upon infection markedly reduced mutant virus. furthermore, sumoylation
of ie1 acidic domain found abolish activity ie1 bind 
stat2 repress interferon-stimulated genes. results provide genetic
evidence ie1 binding stat2 requires 55-amino-acid acidic domain and
promotes viral growth interfering interferon signaling demonstrate
that viral activity negatively regulated cellular sumoylation
pathway.
