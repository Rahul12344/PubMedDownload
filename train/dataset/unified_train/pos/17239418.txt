through yeast two-hybrid analysis coimmunoprecipitation studies, have
identified novel cellular aav-2 rep78/rep68 interaction partner located
predominantly cytoplasm. public databases, assigned as
kctd5, region high similarity cytoplasmic tetramerization 
domain voltage-gated potassium channels. whereas rep/kctd5 interaction relied 
on region surrounding rep nuclear localization signal, nuclear
accumulation rep required. wildtype rep78/rep68 proteins induced the
translocation large portions kctd5 nucleus pointing functional 
interactions cytoplasm nucleus. line anticipated
functional interference cytoplasm, kctd5 overexpression completely
abrogated rep68-mediated posttranscriptional activation hiv-ltr driven
luciferase reporter gene. study expands panel already identified
nuclear rep interaction partners cytoplasmic protein, raises the
awareness important steps aav life cycle may regulated this
compartment.
