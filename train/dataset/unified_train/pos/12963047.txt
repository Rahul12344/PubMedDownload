although hepatitis c virus (hcv) genome synthesized virus-encoded
rna-dependent rna polymerase ns5b, viral cellular factors assumed
to required template-specific initiation regulation rna-synthesis. 
the cellular protein la, normally associates rna polymerase iii
transcripts, also interacts 5'- 3'-untranslated regions several
rna viruses, including hcv. investigate whether viral gene products may 
be involved interaction, constructed hcv cdna expression library in
bacteriophage t7 allowing portions hcv polyprotein displayed 
phage surface. screening phage library la resulted selection of
clones displaying n-terminal region hcv ns5a. co-precipitation of
full-length truncated forms recombinant ns5a la revealed the
n-terminal region ns5a necessary sufficient binding la.
although region ns5a essential hcv replication, role the
ns5a-la interaction infected cell remains established.
