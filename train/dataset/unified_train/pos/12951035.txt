the human subgroup c adenovirus (ad) protein named adenovirus death protein (adp)
(previously named e3-11.6k) synthesized late stages infection 
it mediates efficient lysis cells release adenovirus infect other
cells. adp integral membrane n-linked, o-linked palmitoylated glycoprotein 
of 101 amino acids (aa) localizes nuclear membrane, endoplasmic
reticulum (er), golgi. single membrane spanning region (roughly aa
40-60) oriented aa 1-40 lumen aa 61-101 nucleoplasm
and cytoplasm. using aa 61-101 ad2 adp bait yeast two-hybrid screen,
we isolated cdna 211-aa protein initially database
but published others names human mad2b, mad2l2, and
rev7. adp binds strongly human mad2b yeast also gst
pull-down experiments coimmunoprecipitations adp mad2b synthesized 
in vitro vivo. adp mutants deletions throughout bait region not
interact human mad2b, whereas pro69pro70 ala69ala70 mutant the
"basic-proline" domain adp interact. northern blot analyses indicate that
human mad2b expressed ubiquitously. human mad2b 25% identical to
human mad2, spindle assembly checkpoint protein. two human a549 cell lines were
made constitutively overexpress mad2b. wild-type adenovirus lyses these
cells significantly slowly lyses parental a549 cells, raising the
possibility adp mad2b act opposition suggesting the
adp-mad2b interaction biologically relevant.
