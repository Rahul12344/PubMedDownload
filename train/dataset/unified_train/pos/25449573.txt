hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) transactivates multiple transcription factors
including nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-κb) regulates inflammatory-related
genes. however, regulatory mechanism hbx nf-κb activation remains
largely unknown. study reports hbx augments interleukin-1β
(il-1β)-induced nf-κb activation via interaction toll-like receptor (tlr) 
adapter protein, ecsit (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate toll
pathways). gst pull-down co-immunoprecipitation analyses showed hbx
interacted ecsit. deletion analysis hbx cytotrap two-hybrid system
revealed interaction region hbx ecsit attributed aa 51-80.
co-transfection hbx ecsit il-1β-stimulated cells appeared activate
ikk iκb signaling pathway phosphorylation ikk α/β iκbα was
increased whereas knockdown ecsit hbxδ51-80 mutant attenuated the
phosphorylation. consequence iκbα degradation, nf-κb activated as
evidenced increases nf-κb transcriptional activity nuclear
translocation p65 p50 resulted induction il-10. in
contrast, knockdown ecsit sirna treatment nf-κb selective
inhibitor (helenalin) abolished nf-κb activation il-10 expression. we
conclude ecsit appears novel hbx-interacting signal molecule and
their interaction mechanistically important il-1β induction nf-κb
activation.
