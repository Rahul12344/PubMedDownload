human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv16) infects cervical epithelium is
associated majority cervical cancers. e1e4 protein hpv16 but
not hpv1 hpv6 found associate novel member dead 
box protein family rna helicases sequences c terminus. this
protein, termed e4-dbp (e4-dead box protein), molecular weight 66,000
(66k) shuttle nucleus cytoplasm. binds rna in
vitro, including major hpv16 late transcript (e1e4. l1), an
rna-independent atpase activity partially inhibited e1e4. e4-dbp 
was detectable cytoplasm cells expressing hpv16 e1e4 (in vivo in
vitro) could immunoprecipitated e1e4 complex cervical
epithelial cell lines. cell lines lacking cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, 
loss leucine cluster-cytoplasmic anchor region hpv16 e1wedgee4 resulted
in proteins colocalizing exclusively nucleoli. two additional hpv16
e1e4-binding proteins, 80k 50k, identified pull-down experiments
but recognized antibodies e4-dbp conserved dead box motif. 
sequence analysis e4-dbp revealed homology e4-binding region three
escherichia coli dead box proteins involved regulation mrna stability
and degradation (rhlb, srmb, dead) rrp3 protein saccharomyces
cerevisiae, involved ribosome biogenesis. synthesis hpv16 coat
proteins occurs e1e4 expression genome amplification regulated
at level mrna stability translation. identification e4-dbp an
hpv16 e1e4-associated protein indicates possible role e1e4 virus
synthesis.
