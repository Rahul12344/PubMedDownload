the bzlf1 open reading frame epstein-barr virus (ebv) encodes important
transactivator replication. latency, transcription gene is
switched off. hi motifs shown cause negative regulation the
promoter. using yeast one-hybrid assays, isolated e box-binding protein,
e2-2, interacting motifs. electrophoretic mobility shift assays
demonstrated e2-2 binds hi alpha, hi beta hi gamma, contain e
box consensus binding sites. deletion hi-associated e boxes and
overexpression e2-2 transfection assays revealed elements act as
repressors lymphoid cells. contrast, epithelial cells contribute to
the increased responsiveness promoter transactivation bzlf1
protein. data presented accord alternative exclusive
binding different cell type- differentiation-specific factors, as
e2-2, hi-associated e boxes lymphoid epithelial cells. implies
a role cell type-specific virus replication.
