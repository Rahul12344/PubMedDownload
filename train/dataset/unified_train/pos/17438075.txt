in macrophages, hiv-1 shown bud intracellular structures that
contain late endosome marker cd63. show organelles not
endosomes, internally sequestered plasma membrane domain. using
immunofluorescence microscopy immunoelectron microscopy, find hiv-1
buds compartment contains tetraspanins cd81, cd9, cd53. on
uninfected macrophages, proteins seen cell surface in
intracellular vacuole-like structures complex content vesicles and
interconnected membranes lack endosome markers, including cd63.
significantly, structures accessible small tracers (horseradish
peroxidase ruthenium red) applied cells 4 degrees c, indicating that
they connected cell surface. hiv assembles on, accumulates within,
these intracellular compartments. furthermore, cd63 recruited the
virus-containing structures incorporated virions. results indicate
that, macrophages, hiv-1 exploits previously undescribed intracellular
plasma membrane domain assemble infectious particles.
