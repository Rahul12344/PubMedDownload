during assembly human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) particles, the
tetraspanin cd63 incorporated viral membrane. indeed, cell
surface tetraspanin microdomains include cd63 proposed sites
for virus release. addition, antibodies cd63 inhibit hiv infection
of macrophages. cell type, hiv assembles intracellularly sequestered
plasma membrane domains contain several tetraspanins, including cd81, 
cd9, cd53. cd63 recruited domain following hiv infection.
together, observations suggest cd63 may function the
assembly infectious virus particles and/or infectivity assembled
virions. used rna interference knock cd63 expression in
monocyte-derived primary macrophages. show absence cd63, hiv
assembly quantitatively comparable seen cd63-expressing macrophages
and virus assembly occurs compartments positive cd81, cd9, cd53. 
moreover, infectivity macrophage-derived virus unaffected loss
of cd63. together, results indicate least tissue culture, cd63
expression required either production infectivity hiv-1.
