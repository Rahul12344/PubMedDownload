in screen binding partners epstein-barr virus transformation-related
protein ebna2, cloned novel, evolutionarily conserved protein showing
similarity drosophila parallel sister chromatids protein (pasc). have
named protein "friend ebna2" (foe). human foe encodes protein 1227
amino acids functional bipartite nuclear localization signal, an
arginine-rich motif, putative nuclear export signal well three
highly acidic regions predicted coiled-coil domain. foe ebna2
coimmunoprecipitate lymphocyte nuclear extracts. rna protein blots show 
that foe expressed human tissues. foe nuclear protein the
bulk protein associated insoluble nuclear fraction biochemically 
defined nuclear matrix. indirect immunofluorescence dynamic imaging
studies suggest foe associates transcriptionally active nuclear
subregions interphase cells concentrates ends formed chromosomes
during mitosis.
