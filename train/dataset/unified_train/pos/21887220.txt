background: nucleoprotein (np) influenza virus multifunctional
protein plays critical role replication transcription the
viral genome. therefore, examining host factors interact np may shed
light mechanism host restriction barriers tissue tropism of
influenza virus. here, cyclophilin e (cype), member peptidyl-propyl
cis-trans isomerase (ppiase) family, found bind np inhibit viral
replication transcription.
methodology/principal findings: present study, cype found interact 
with np components viral ribonucleoprotein complex 
(vrnp): pb1, pb2, pa. mutagenesis data revealed cype domain
comprised residues 137-186 responsible binding np. functional
analysis results indicated cype negative regulator influenza
virus life cycle. furthermore, knock-down cype resulted increased levels of
three types viral rna, suggesting cype negatively affects viral
replication transcription. moreover, up-regulation cype inhibited the
activity influenza viral polymerase. determined molecular
mechanism cype negatively regulates influenza virus replication and
transcription interfering np self-association np-pb1 and
np-pb2 interactions.
conclusions/significance: cype host restriction factor inhibits the
functions np, well viral replication transcription, impairing the
formation vrnp. data presented help us better understand 
the molecular mechanisms host restriction barriers, host adaptation, and
tissue tropism influenza virus.
