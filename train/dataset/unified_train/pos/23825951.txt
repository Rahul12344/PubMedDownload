influenza virus major human pathogen genome comprised eight
single-strand, negative-sense, rna segments. two viral rna segments, ns1 m,
undergo alternative splicing yield several proteins including ns1, ns2, m1
and m2 proteins. however, mechanisms players involved splicing these
viral rna segments fully studied. here, investigating the
interacting partners function cellular protein ns1-binding protein
(ns1-bp), revealed novel players splicing m1 segment. using a
proteomics approach, identified complex rna binding proteins containing
ns1-bp heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnrnps), among are
hnrnps involved host pre-mrna splicing. found low levels ns1-bp
specifically impaired proper alternative splicing viral m1 mrna segment to
yield m2 mrna without affecting splicing mrna3, m4, ns mrna
segments. biochemical analysis formaldehyde uv cross-linking
demonstrated ns1-bp interact directly viral m1 mrna its
interacting partners, hnrnps a1, k, l, m, directly bound m1 mrna. among these
hnrnps, identified hnrnp k major mediator m1 mrna splicing. m1
mrna segment generates matrix protein m1 m2 ion channel, are
essential proteins involved viral trafficking, release cytoplasm, and
budding. thus, reduction ns1-bp and/or hnrnp k levels altered m2/m1 mrna and
protein ratios, decreasing m2 levels inhibiting virus replication. thus,
ns1-bp-hnrnpk complex key mediator influenza virus gene expression.
