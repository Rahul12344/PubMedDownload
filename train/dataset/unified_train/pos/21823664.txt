the hepatitis c virus core protein (hcvc) forms viral nucleocapsid is
involved viral persistence pathogenesis, possibly interacting host
factors modulate viral replication cellular functions. here, identified
36 cellular protein candidates one-dimensional sds-page lc-ms/ms-based
proteomics affinity purification hcvc174, matured form hcvc 
hcv-1b genotype, tagged biotin calmodulin-binding peptide/protein at
n- c-termini, respectively. pull-down confocal imaging techniques, 
confirmed heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein h1 (hnrnph1), nuclear
factor 45 (nf45), c14orf166 novel hcvc174-interacting host proteins,
known participate mrna metabolism, gene regulation, microtubule
organization, respectively. unlike 2 proteins, nf45 interacted with
hcvc174 rna-dependent manner. 3 proteins colocalized ectopic
hcvc-1b cytoplasm nucleus, demonstrated spatial
interaction naturally translocated hcvc174 hcvc biogenesis. such
colocalization, however, shifted cytoplasm cells replicating virus
of 1b 2a genotype, indicating active viral replication confined these
interacting proteins cytoplasm. collectively, findings suggest that
spatial interactions hnrnph1, nf45, c14orf166 hcvc174 likely modulate
hcv cellular functions acute chronic hcv infection.
