human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causative agent adult
t-cell leukemia (atl), whereas closely related virus htlv-2 been
associated malignant conditions. htlv-1 tax1 oncoprotein transforms a
rat fibroblast cell line (rat-1) much efficiently htlv-2 tax2. 
using differential display analysis, isolated magi-3 tax1-inducible
gene rat-1 cells. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
analysis confirmed tax1 induced magi-3 rat-1 cells. magi-3 multiple
pdz domains interacted tax1 tax2 293t cells. interaction 
of tax1 magi-3 dependent pdz domain-binding motif, missing
in tax2. interaction tax1 magi-3 altered respective subcellular
localization, moreover, interaction correlated well high
transforming activities tax1 rat-1 cells relative tax2. magi-3 mrna 
the allied magi-1, magi-2, expressed htlv-1-infected t-cell
lines. results suggest interaction tax1 magi-3 alters their
respective biological activities, may play role transformation tax1
as well pathogenesis htlv-1-associated diseases.
