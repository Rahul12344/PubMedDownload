leukocyte chemoattractants act rapidly growing subfamily g
protein-coupled receptors. report cloning novel human gene encoding
an orphan receptor (chemr23) related c3a, c5a formyl met-leu-phe
receptors, distantly subfamilies chemokine receptors. chemr23 
transcripts found abundant monocyte-derived dendritic cells and
macrophages, treated lps. low expression could also detected by
reverse transcription-pcr cd4+ lymphocytes. gene encoding chemr23 was
assigned radiation hybrid mapping q21.2-21.3 region human chromosome
12, outside gene clusters identified far chemoattractant receptors.
given increasing number chemoattractant receptors used hiv-1, hiv-2 and
siv coreceptors, chemr23 tested fusion assays potential coreceptor 
activity range viral strains. none tested hiv-2 strains made use
of chemr23 coreceptor, several siv strains (sivmac316, sivmac239,
sivmacl7e-fr sivsm62a), well primary hiv-1 strain (92ug024-2) used it
efficiently. chemr23 therefore appears coreceptor immunodeficiency
viruses belong chemokine receptor family. also a
putative chemoattractant receptor relatively specific antigen-presenting
cells, could play important role recruitment trafficking of
these cell populations. future work required identify ligand(s) of
this new g protein-coupled receptor define precise role the
physiology dendritic cells macrophages.
