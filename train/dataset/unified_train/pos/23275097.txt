enoyl-coenzyme hydratase (echs1) key enzyme metabolism fatty
acids mitochondria. previously reported hepatitis b surface antigen
(hbsag) interacted echs1 yeast two-hybrid system. current study,
we examined interaction using gst pull-down and
co-immunoprecipitation assays. results confirmed small hepatitis b
surface antigen (shbs) interacted echs1. furthermore, confocal imaging
showed shbs echs1 co-localized hepg2 cells. clarify biological
function interaction, human hepatoma cell lines transiently and
stably expressed shbs generated. expression shbs led significant
decrease echs1 protein levels. echs1 protein levels reduced to
48.44 ± 7.12 % huh7 cells transiently expressing shbs, 54.97 ± 3.54 %
in hepg2 cells stably expressing shbs. conclusion, findings suggest that
shbs interacts echs1 regulates echs1 protein levels hepatoma cells.
