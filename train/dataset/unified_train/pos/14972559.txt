the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) encodes gene product, vpr, causes 
infected cells arrest delay g2 phase cell cycle. arrest
in g2 characterized low levels cyclin b1-p34cdc2 activity and
corresponding inhibitory phosphorylation p34cdc2. find vpr directly
inhibits vitro activity phosphatase, cdc25c, normally activates
cyclin b1-p34cdc2. vpr binds cdc25c vitro mammalian cells. vpr 
is also able inhibit cdc25c phosphatase activity vitro although binds to
a site cdc25c distinct catalytic site enzyme.
expression catalytically active mutant cdc25c reduced
binding vpr well catalytically inactive mutant cdc25c retains 
binding vpr able largely overcome vpr-mediated g2 arrest. finally,
depletion cdc25c cells also renders partially resistant the
effects vpr.
