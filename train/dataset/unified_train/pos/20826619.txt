the poxvirus anaphase promoting complex regulator (pacr) promotes viral
replication manipulating anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (apc/c), a
multisubunit ubiquitin ligase complex essential roles cell cycle
regulation. pacr sequence similarities apc/c subunit 11 (apc11) and
associates apc/c subunits. however, unlike apc11, expression pacr
disrupts apc/c functions. here, investigated interaction pacr
with apc/c. following knockdown apc1, subunit linking apc11/apc2 the
rest apc/c, pacr remained bound apc2 other, distal, subunits 
the complex, suggesting pacr associates apc/c via apc2. supported
by demonstration, vitro, direct interaction pacr apc2.
moreover, presence pacr interfered interactions apc11
and apc2. based observations propose pacr competes apc11
for incorporation apc/c.
