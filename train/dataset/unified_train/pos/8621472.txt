the assembly preinitiation complex containing rna polymerase ii promoter 
dna complex process involves several general transcription factors.
using 5-[n-(p-azidobenzoyl)-3-aminoallyl] photocross-linking, previously
determined locations two large subunits transcription factor (tf)
iia (a35 a21), tata box-binding protein (tbp), rna polymerase ii-associated
protein (rap) 30, tfiib along ad2 ml promoter. localized
tfiie34 rap74 upstream transcription start site. two subunits
of tfiif, rap74 rap30, cross-linked nucleotides probed adjacent
spaces face dna helix beginning downstream tbp -19 
and extending -5. specific photocross-linking tfiie34 required presence
tfiie56. addition, tfiie rap74 strongly stimulated cross-linking rap30 
and large subunits rna polymerase ii position -19. topological data
support idea rap74 tfiie34 may involved melting the
promoter dna upstream initiation site.
