the accessory gene vpr, common primate lentiviruses, induces potent g2/m
arrest cycling cells. recent study showed human immunodeficiency virus 
type 1 (hiv-1) viral protein r (vpr) mediates activation the
slx4/mus81/eme1 exonuclease complex forms part fanconi anemia dna
repair pathway. confirm observations, examined g2/m arrest
phenotypes panel simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) vpr proteins. we
show siv vpr proteins differ ability promote cell cycle arrest
in human cells. dependent dcaf1/ddb1/cul4 ubiquitin ligase
complex, interaction human dcaf1 predict g2/m arrest activity of
siv vpr human cells. cases, siv vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest human
cells correlated interaction human slx4 (huslx4) could abolished
by small interfering rna (sirna) depletion member slx4 complex. 
contrast, one hiv/siv vpr proteins tested, including that
lacked activity human cells, competent g2/m arrest grivet cells.
correspondingly, cell cycle arrest correlated interaction the
grivet orthologues slx4 complex, suggesting level host adaptation 
these interactions. phylogenetic analyses strongly suggest g2/m arrest/slx4 
interactions ancestral activities primate lentiviral vpr proteins that
the ability dysregulate fanconi anemia dna repair pathway essential 
function vpr vivo.importance: vpr protein hiv-1 related viruses 
is essential virus vivo. ability vpr block cell cycle at
mitotic entry well known, importance function viral
replication unclear. recent data shown hiv-1 vpr targets fanconi
anemia dna repair pathway interacting activating endonuclease
complex, slx4/mus81/eme1, processes interstrand dna cross-links. we
show ability panel siv vpr proteins mediate cell cycle arrest
correlates species-specific interactions slx4 complex human 
primate cells. results studies suggest slx4 complex a
conserved target primate lentiviral vpr proteins ability to
dysregulate members fanconi anemia dna repair pathway essential for
hiv/siv replication vivo.
