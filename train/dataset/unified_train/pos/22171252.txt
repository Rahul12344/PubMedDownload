the human cytomegalovirus tegument protein ul69 shown required for
efficient viral replication low multiplicities infection. several functions
have associated ul69, including ability regulate cell cycle
progression, translation, export viral transcripts nucleus to
the cytoplasm. however, remains unclear which, any, activities
contribute phenotype observed ul69 deletion mutant. ul69 been
shown interact cellular protein spt6. functional significance 
this interaction never examined context infection. to
address this, generated ul69 mutant viruses unable interact 
spt6 determined effect mutations virus replication.
abolishing ul69's ability interact spt6 protein inhibited virus
replication levels indistinguishable observed following infection
with ul69 deletion mutant. surprisingly, abolishing ul69's interaction with
spt6 also resulted impairment ul69 shuttling activity. finally, we
demonstrate inhibition spt6 expression short hairpin rna (shrna)
knockdown inhibits wild-type virus replication. taken together, results
demonstrate ul69's ability interact spt6 plays critical role in
viral replication.
