hepatitis c virus (hcv) highly dependent cellular proteins own
propagation. order identify cellular factors involved hcv
propagation, performed protein microarray assays using hcv core protein as
a probe. ~9,000 host proteins immobilized microarray, approximately 100
cellular proteins identified hcv core-interacting partners. these
candidates, mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 3
(mapkapk3) selected characterization. mapkapk3 a
serine/threonine protein kinase activated stress growth inducers. 
binding hcv core mapkapk3 confirmed vitro pulldown assay and
further verified coimmunoprecipitation assay. hcv core protein interacted with
mapkapk3 amino acid residues 41 75 core n-terminal half 
kinase domain mapkapk3. addition, rna protein levels mapkapk3
were elevated hcv subgenomic replicon cells cell culture-derived hcv 
(hcvcc)-infected cells. silencing mapkapk3 expression resulted decreases in
both protein hcv infectivity levels intracellular hcv rna
level. showed mapkapk3 increased hcv ires-mediated translation and
mapkapk3-dependent hcv ires activity increased core protein. these
data suggest hcv core may modulate mapkapk3 facilitate own
propagation.
