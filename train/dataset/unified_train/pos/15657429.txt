cellular senescence triggered variety signals, including loss of
telomeric integrity intense oncogenic signaling, considered potent,
natural tumor suppressor mechanism. previously, shown the
promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml) induces cellular senescence when
overexpressed primary human fibroblasts. mechanism pml iv
isoform elicits irreversible growth arrest believed involve activation
of tumor suppressor pathways p21/p53 p16/rb; however, requirement for
either pathway demonstrated unequivocally. investigate the
individual contributions p53 rb pml-induced senescence, used
oncoproteins e6 e7 human papillomaviruses (hpvs), predominantly
target p53 rb. show e7, e6, circumvents pml-induced
senescence. using different e7 mutant proteins, dominant negative
cyclin-dependent kinase 4, p16 rna interference, demonstrate that
rb-related rb-independent mechanisms e7 necessary subversion of
pml-induced senescence identify pml novel target e7. interaction 
between e7 functional prosenescence complex composed pml, p53, cbp
perturbs transcriptional activation p53, thus highlighting significant
effect also p53 tumor suppressor pathway. given importance hpv in
the pathogenesis cervical cancer, results warrant detailed analyses
of pml hpv infections.
