interferons (ifns) encode family secreted proteins provide the
front-line defense viral infections. diverse biological actions are
thought mediated products specific usually overlapping sets
of cellular genes induced target cells. recently isolated new
human ifn-induced gene termed isg20, codes 3' 5'
exonuclease specificity single-stranded rna and, lesser extent, for
dna. report, demonstrate isg20 involved antiviral
functions ifn. absence ifn treatment, isg20-overexpressing hela
cells showed resistance infections vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv),
influenza virus, encephalomyocarditis virus (three rna genomic viruses) but
not dna genomic adenovirus. isg20 specifically interfered vsv mrna
synthesis protein production leaving expression cellular control
genes unaffected. antiviral effect observed cells overexpressing a
mutated isg20 protein defective exonuclease activity, demonstrating the
antiviral effects due exonuclease activity isg20. addition, the
inactive mutant isg20 protein, able inhibit isg20 exonuclease
activity vitro, significantly reduced ability ifn block vsv
development. taken together, data suggested antiviral activity 
ifn vsv partly mediated isg20. thus show that, besides rnase l, 
isg20 antiviral activity, supporting idea might represent a
novel antiviral pathway mechanism ifn action.
