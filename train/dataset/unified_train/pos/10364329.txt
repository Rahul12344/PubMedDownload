the biological activity human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) tat
(tat1) transcriptional activator requires recruitment tat1-cyclint1
(cyct1) complex tar rna target encoded within viral long terminal
repeat (ltr). primate immunodeficiency viruses, hiv-2 and
mandrill simian immunodeficiency virus (sivmnd), also encode tat proteins that
activate transcription via rna targets, proteins differ significantly, both
from tat1, terms ability activate
transcription directed ltr promoter elements found different hiv siv
isolates. here, show cyct1 also serves essential cofactor hiv-2
tat (tat2) sivmnd tat (tat-m) function. moreover, cyct1 complex formed by
each tat protein displays distinct rna target specificity accurately
predicts level activation observed particular ltr. tat2 and
tat-m share ability tat1 bind cyct1, differ tat1 that
they also able bind related distinct cyct2. however, the
resultant tat-cyct2 complexes fail bind tar therefore abortive.
surprisingly, mutation single residue cyct2 (asparagine 260 cysteine) 
rescues ability cyct2 bind tat1 also activates tar binding
by three tat-cyct2 complexes also tat function. therefore, rna target
specificity different tat-cyct1 complexes modulated natural sequence
variation viral tat transcriptional activator host cell
cyct molecule recruited tat. further, rna target specificity the
resultant tat-cyct1 complex accurately predicts ability complex to
activate transcription given ltr promoter element.
