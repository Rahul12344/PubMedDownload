influenza virus transcription occurs nuclei infected cells, the
viral genomic rnas complexed nucleoprotein (np) form
ribonucleoprotein (rnp) structures. prior assembly progeny virions, these
rnps exit nucleus accumulate cytoplasm. mechanisms responsible
for rnp export partially understood proposed involve
the viral m1 ns2 polypeptides. found drug leptomycin b (lmb),
which specifically inactivates cellular crm1 polypeptide, caused nuclear
retention np virus-infected cells, indicating role crm1 nuclear
export pathway rnp egress. however, alteration seen cellular
distribution m1 ns2, even case mutant virus synthesizes
greatly reduced amounts ns2. furthermore, np distributed throughout the
nuclei infected cells early times postinfection but, retained the
nucleus late times lmb treatment, redistributed periphery the
nucleoplasm. change seen nuclear distribution m1 ns2
after drug treatment. similar behavior np, m1 ns2 infected
cells, lmb treatment cells expressing polypeptide isolation caused
nuclear retention np m1 ns2. conversely, overexpression crm1
caused increased cytoplasmic accumulation np little effect m1 or
ns2 distribution. consistent this, np bound crm1 vitro. overall, these
data raise possibility rnp export mediated direct interaction
between np cellular crm1 export pathway.
