molluscum contagiosum virus (mcv), member human poxvirus family, encodes
the mc159 protein inhibits fas-, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-, and
tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligant (trail)-induced apoptosis. used
site-directed mutagenesis change charged hydrophobic amino acid residues to
alanines identify regions mc159 critical protection from
apoptosis protein-protein interactions. surprisingly, mc159 is
thought block apoptosis binding fas-associated death domain (fadd) or
caspase-8, several mutants lost apoptosis blocking activity still bound to
both fadd caspase-8. mutations predicted hydrophobic patch 1 and
alpha2 regions death effector domains (deds) within mc159 resulted in
loss ability bind fadd caspase-8 block apoptosis. amino
acid substitutions rxdl motif located alpha6 region either ded
resulted loss protection apoptosis induced fas, tnf, trail 
abolished ability mc159 block death effector filament formation. thus, 
charged hydrophobic amino acids three regions mc159 deds
(hydrophobic patch 1, alpha2, alpha6) critical protein's ability 
to interact cellular proteins block apoptosis.
