enterovirus 71 (ev71) one major pathogens cause hand, foot, and
mouth disease outbreaks young children asia-pacific region recent
years. human scavenger receptor class b 2 (scarb2) main cellular receptor 
for ev71 target cells. requirements ev71-scarb2 interaction have
not fully characterized, determined whether scarb2
serves uncoating receptor ev71. compared efficiency 
receptor different species including human, horseshoe bat, mouse, and
hamster demonstrated residues 144 151 critical for
scarb2 binding viral capsid protein vp1 ev71 seven residues the
human receptor could convert murine scarb2, otherwise inefficient receptor, to
an efficient receptor ev71 viral infection. also identified ev71
binds scarb2 via canyon vp1 around residue gln-172. soluble scarb2 could 
convert ev71 virions 160 135 particles, indicating scarb2 is
an uncoating receptor virus. uncoating efficiency scarb2
significantly increased acidic environment (ph 5.6). studies
elucidated viral capsid receptor determinants enterovirus 71 infection
and revealed possible target antiviral interventions.
