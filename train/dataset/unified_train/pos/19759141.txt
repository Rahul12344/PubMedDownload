autophagy important component host innate adaptive immunity to
viruses. critical degradation intracellular pathogens for
promoting antigen presentation. herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) infection
induces autophagy response, response antagonized hsv-1
neurovirulence gene product, icp34.5. due, part, interaction
with essential autophagy protein beclin 1 (atg6) via beclin-binding
domain (bbd) icp34.5. using recombinant virus lacking bbd, examined
pathogenesis immune responses using mouse models infection. the
bbd-deficient virus (delta68h) replicated equivalently marker-rescued
counterpart (delta68hr) early times cleared rapidly than
delta68hr tissues late times following corneal infection. in
addition, infection cornea delta68h induced less ocular disease
than delta68hr. results suggested delta68h attenuated due its
failure control adaptive rather innate immunity. support idea,
delta68h stimulated significantly stronger cd4(+) t-cell-mediated delayed-type 
hypersensitivity response resulted significantly production gamma 
interferon interleukin-2 hsv-specific cd4(+) cells delta68hr.
taken together, data suggest role bbd icp34.5 precluding
autophagy-mediated class ii antigen presentation, thereby enhancing virulence
and pathogenesis hsv-1.
