human species adenoviruses (hadvs) comprise three serotypes: hadv-12, -18, 
-31. viruses common pathogens cause systemic infections that
usually involve airways and/or intestine. immunocompromised individuals,
species adenoviruses general, hadv-31 particular, cause
life-threatening infections. combining binding infection experiments, we
demonstrate coagulation factor ix (fix) efficiently enhances binding and
infection hadv-18 hadv-31, hadv-12, epithelial cells
originating airways intestine. markedly different the
mechanism hadv-5 human adenoviruses, utilize coagulation
factor x (fx) infection host cells. surface plasmon resonance experiments 
revealed affinity hadv-31 hexon-fix interaction higher than
that hadv-5 hexon-fx interaction half-lives these
interactions profoundly different. moreover, hadv-31-fix hadv-5-fx
complexes bind heparan sulfate-containing glycosaminoglycans (gags) target 
cells, binding studies utilizing cells expressing specific gags and
gag-cleaving enzymes revealed differences gag dependence specificity
between two complexes. findings add understanding the
intricate infection pathways used human adenoviruses, may contribute 
to better design hadv-based vectors gene cancer therapy. furthermore, 
the interaction hadv-31 hexon fix may also serve target 
antiviral treatment.
