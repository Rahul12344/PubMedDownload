the human integrin late antigen (vla)-2 (cd49b/cd29) mediates interactions
with collagen receptor echovirus 1. binding sites both
collagen echovirus 1 mapped domain within alpha2
subunit vla-2 alpha2beta1 heterodimer. although murine vla-2 interacts
with collagen, bind virus. used isolated human-murine
chimeric domains expressed glutathione s-transferase fusion proteins in
escherichia coli identify two groups amino acids, 199-201 212-216,
independently involved virus attachment. residues distinct 
metal ion-dependent adhesion site previously demonstrated essential for
vla-2 interactions collagen. mutations three metal ion-dependent adhesion
site residues abolish adhesion collagen effect virus binding.
these results confirm different sites within domain responsible
for vla-2 interaction extracellular matrix proteins viral ligands.
