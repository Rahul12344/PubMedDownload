hcmv ul76 member conserved herpesviridae protein family (herpes_ul24)
that involved viral production, latency, reactivation. ul76 presents as
globular aggresomes nuclei transiently transfected cells. bioinformatic
analyses predict ul76 propensity aggregation targets cellular 
proteins implicated protein folding ubiquitin-proteasome systems (ups).
furthermore, fluorescence recovery photobleaching experiments suggests that
ul76 reduces protein mobility aggresome, indicates ul76 elicits
the aggregation misfolded proteins. moreover, absence viral
proteins, ul76 interacts s5a, major receptor polyubiquitinated
proteins ups proteolysis via conserved region von willebrand
factor type (vwa) domain s5a. demonstrate ul76 sequesters
polyubiquitinated proteins s5a nuclear aggresomes biological proximity.
after knockdown endogenous s5a rna interference techniques, ul76 level 
was minimally affected transiently expressing cells. however, a
significant reduction number cells containing ul76 nuclear aggresomes
was observed, suggests s5a may play key role aggresome formation.
moreover, show ul76 interacts s5a late phase viral
infection knockdown s5a hinders development the
replication compartment aggresome. study, demonstrate that
ul76 induces novel nuclear aggresome, likely subverting s5a ups.
given ul76 belongs conserved family, underlying mechanism may be
shared members herpesviridae.
