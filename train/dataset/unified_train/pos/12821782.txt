the papillomavirus e6 protein binds directs ubiquitin-dependent
degradation p53 tumor suppressor protein. independent this
p53-degradative function, however, e6 induces cellular telomerase activity. 
increase enzyme activity reflects e6-enhanced transcription human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (htert) catalytic subunit, molecular
basis transactivation unknown. present study, demonstrate
that e6/myc interactions regulate htert gene expression. mad protein, specific 
antagonist myc, repressed e6-mediated transactivation htert promoter
and repression relieved myc overexpression. proximal myc/
max-binding element (e-box) htert promoter major determinant of
both e6 myc responsiveness keratinocytes. e6 alter myc protein
expression myc/max association, induction htert myc/e6 was
independent myc phosphorylation thr-58/ser-62 within transactivation
domain. however, immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated endogenous myc
protein coprecipitated e6 protein chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses
demonstrated e6 myc proteins bound minimal 295-bp htert
promoter. "high-risk" e6 proteins bound htert promoter,
consistent preferential ability induce telomerase. observation 
that e6 associates myc complexes activates myc-responsive gene
identifies mechanism oncogene modulate cell proliferation and
differentiation.
