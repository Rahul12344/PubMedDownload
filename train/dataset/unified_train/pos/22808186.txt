hiv-1 exploits numerous host cellular pathways productive infection. to
identify novel factors involved hiv-1 replication, hiv-1 integrase matrix 
protein complexes captured 4 hours post infection proteomic analysis 
using affinity purification system. leucine-rich ppr-motif containing (lrpprc)
protein, cellular protein involved mitochondrial function, cell metabolism, 
and cell-cycle progression identified one candidate hiv-1 factors. 
co-immunoprecipitation rt-pcr experiments confirmed lrpprc associated with
hiv-1 nucleic acids early steps virus infection. establish if
lrpprc critical hiv-1 infection, three independent lrpprc knockdown cell 
lines constructed (2.7, 3.6, 4.1). subcellular fractionation these
cell lines revealed differential knockdown lrpprc subcellular compartments.
lrpprc knocked insoluble/cytoskeletal fractions three cell
lines, 3.6 4.1 cells also showed reduction nuclear lrpprc.
additionally, several cellular factors downregulated and/or disrupted by
loss lrpprc. hiv-1 infection reduced three cell lines, virus
production rna encapsidation unaffected, suggesting lrpprc was
critical afferent stage virus replication. two three cell lines
(3.6, 4.1) refractory murine leukemia virus infection, virus dependent
on cellular proliferation productive infection. consistent this, these
two cell lines exhibited reduced cellular growth loss cellular
viability change cell cycle phenotype. early steps virus infection
were also differentially affected among cell lines. reduced level of
preintegration complex formation observed three cell lines, viral 
dna nuclear import reduced 3.6 4.1 cells. combined, these
data identify lrpprc hiv-1 factor involved hiv-1 replication
through one mechanism.
