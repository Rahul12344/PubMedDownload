many viruses, including members several poxvirus genera, encode inhibitors
that block apoptosis simultaneously binding proapoptotic bcl-2 proteins
bak bax. orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus encodes bcl-2-like f1 protein, 
which sequesters bak bax. however, n1, potent virulence factor, is
reported antiapoptotic interact bax. investigated
whether vaccinia virus inhibits bak/bax-dependent apoptosis via cooperative
action f1 n1. found western reserve (wr) δn1l viruses
inhibited drug- infection-induced apoptosis equally. meanwhile, infections
with δf1l δn1l/f1l virus resulted similar levels bax activation and
apoptosis. outside context infection, n1 block drug- or
bax-induced cell death interact bax. addition f1 n1, vaccinia
virus encodes structural homologs bcl-2 proteins conserved in
orthopoxviruses, including a46, a52, b14, c1, c6, c16/b22, k7, n2. however,
we found associate bax inhibit drug-induced cell death.
based findings n1 antiapoptotic protein, propose that
the f1 orthologs represent orthopoxvirus bcl-2 homolog directly
inhibit bak/bax checkpoint.
