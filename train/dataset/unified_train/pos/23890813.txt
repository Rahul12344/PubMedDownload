tnf receptor associated factor 2 (traf2) plays important role cellular 
innate immune well inflammatory responses. previous studies reported
traf2 mediated regulation tnf interferon (ifn) induced canonical and
non-canonical activation nfκb. study, show rotavirus nsp1
targets traf2 regulate ifn induced non-canonical nfκb activation. we
found rotavirus non-structural protein-1 (nsp1) interacts traf2 and
degrades proteasome dependent manner. c-terminal part nsp1 was
sufficient interacting traf2 alone could degrade traf2. 
inhibition interferon mediated non-canonical nfκb activation nsp1 may
modulate inflammatory cytokine production rotavirus infection help the
virus propagation.
