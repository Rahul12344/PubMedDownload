oncoproteins dna tumor viruses associate critical cellular proteins 
regulate cell proliferation, survival, differentiation. human papillomavirus 
(hpv) e6 oncoproteins previously shown associate cellular
hect domain ubiquitin ligase termed e6ap (ube3a). show e6-e6ap
complex associates targets degradation protein tyrosine
phosphatase ptpn3 (ptph1) vitro living cells. ptpn3 a
membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase ferm, pdz, ptp domains
previously implicated regulating tyrosine phosphorylation growth factor
receptors p97 vcp (valosin-containing protein, termed cdc48 saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) mutated subset colon cancers. degradation ptpn3 
e6 requires e6ap, proteasome, interaction carboxy terminus
of e6 pdz domain ptpn3. transduced keratinocytes, e6 confers
reduced growth factor requirements, function requires pdz ligand e6
and part replicated inhibiting expression ptpn3. this
report demonstrates potential e6 regulate phosphotyrosine metabolism
through targeted degradation tyrosine phosphatase.
