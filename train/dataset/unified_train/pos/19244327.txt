infection mice murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (mhv-68) provides valuable
animal model gamma-2 herpesvirus (rhadinovirus) infection pathogenesis.
the mhv-68 orf73 protein shown required establishment of
viral latency vivo. study describes novel transcriptional activation
function mhv-68 orf73 protein identifies cellular bromodomain
containing bet proteins brd2/ring3, brd3/orfx, brd4 interaction partners
for mhv-68 orf73 protein. bet protein members known interact with
acetylated histones, brd2 brd4 implicated fundamental
cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation transcriptional
regulation. using mhv-68 orf73 peptide array assays, identified brd2 brd4 
interaction sites orf73 protein. mutation one binding site led a
loss interaction brd2/4 retinoblastoma protein rb, to
impaired chromatin association, decreased ability activate the
bet-responsive cyclin d1, d2, e promoters. results therefore pinpoint the
binding site brd2/4 rhadinoviral orf73 protein suggest the
recruitment member bet protein family allows mhv-68 orf73 protein
to activate promoters g(1)/s cyclins. findings point parallels
between transcriptional activator functions rhadinoviral orf73 proteins
and papillomavirus e2 proteins.
