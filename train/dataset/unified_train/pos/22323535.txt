hiv-1 infection cells regulated tcr activation. however, cellular 
proteins tcr pathway regulate hiv-1 infection poorly
characterized. study, hiv-1 infection, observed significant
reduction hiv-1 virus production src homology 2 domain-containing leukocyte
protein 76 kda (slp-76)-deficient jurkat cells compared wild-type and
slp-76-reconstituted jurkat cells. confirmed role slp-76 in
hiv-1 infection small interfering rna-mediated knockdown mt4 cells and
pbmcs. structural-functional analysis revealed n-terminal domain of
slp-76 important regulating hiv-1 infection. mechanistic studies 
revealed lack slp-76 impaired virus release, affect viral
entry, integration, transcription. also showed slp-76 plays a
critical role cell-to-cell transmission hiv-1. signaling studies revealed
that slp-76 associated viral negative regulatory factor protein multiple
signaling molecules hiv-1 infection. furthermore, slp-76 facilitated the
association negative regulatory factor f-actin, suggesting slp-76
mediates formation signaling complex may regulate viral release via
cytoskeletal changes. taken together, studies demonstrate novel role for
the adaptor molecule slp-76 regulating hiv-1 infection cells the
potential develop innovative strategies hiv-1.
