elicitation broadly neutralizing antibodies essential development
of protective vaccine hiv-1. however, native hiv-1 envelope adopts 
a protected conformation conceals highly conserved sites vulnerability
from antibody recognition. although high-definition structures monomeric
core envelope glycoprotein subunit gp120 and, recently, a
stabilized soluble gp140 trimer solved, fundamental aspects related 
the conformation function native envelope remain unresolved. here, 
show conserved central region second variable loop (v2) gp120 
contains sulfated tyrosines (tys173 tys177) cd4-unbound prefusion
state mediate intramolecular interaction v2 conserved base the
third variable loop (v3), functionally mimicking sulfated tyrosines ccr5 and
anti-coreceptor-binding-site antibodies 412d. recombinant gp120 expressed
in continuous cell lines displays low constitutive levels v2 tyrosine

cd4(+) cells inherently highly sulfated. consistent functional role
