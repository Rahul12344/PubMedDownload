myxoma virus (myxv) m062r functional homolog c7l family host range
genes orthopoxviruses. constructed targeted m062r-knockout-myxv
(vmyxm062-ko) characterized properties vitro vivo. european 
rabbits, infection vmyxm062-ko completely asymptomatic. surviving
rabbits gain full protection subsequent lethal-dose challenge
with wild-type myxv. also looked cellular tropism defects variety 
cultured cells. rabbit cells tested, vmyxm062-ko conducts an
abortive infection, although initiates viral dna replication. many, not
all, human cancer cells permissive wild-type myxv, vmyxm062-ko
exhibited profound replication defect. categorized human cells tested into
two groups: (i) type a, support productive replication wild-type myxv
but unable produce significant levels progeny virus vmyxm062-ko, and
(ii) type b, permissive infections wild-type myxv and
vmyxm062-ko. furthermore, using proteomic strategies, identified sterile Î±
motif domain containing 9 (samd9), interferon-regulated cellular protein
implicated human inflammatory disorders, unique host binding partner of
m062 human cells. significantly, knocking samd9 type human cancer
cells led substantial rescue vmyxm062-ko infection. summary, m062 a
novel host range factor controls productive myxv replication rabbit cells
and wide variety human cells. m062 also binds antagonizes cellular
samd9 human cells, suggesting samd9 novel innate antiviral factor
against poxviruses.
