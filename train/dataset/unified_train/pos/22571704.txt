background: newcastle disease virus (ndv) enveloped rna virus, bearing
severe economic losses poultry industry worldwide. previous virion
proteomic studies shown enveloped viruses carry multiple host cellular 
proteins internally externally life cycle. address
whether also occurred ndv infection, performed comprehensive
proteomic analysis highly purified ndv la sota strain particles.
results: addition five viral structural proteins, detected thirty
cellular proteins associated purified ndv la sota particles. identified 
cellular proteins comprised several functional categories, including cytoskeleton
proteins, annexins, molecular chaperones, chromatin modifying proteins,
enzymes-binding proteins, calcium-binding proteins signal
transduction-associated proteins. among these, three host proteins 
previously reported virions virus families, including two signal
transduction-associated proteins (syntenin ras small gtpase) one
tumor-associated protein (tumor protein d52). presence five selected
cellular proteins (i.e., Î²-actin, tubulin, annexin a2, heat shock protein hsp90
and ezrin) associated purified ndv particles validated western
blot immunogold labeling assays.
conclusions: current study presented first standard proteomic profile 
ndv. results demonstrated incorporation cellular proteins ndv
particles, provides valuable information elucidating viral infection
and pathogenesis.
