human papillomavirus (hpv) infection primary risk factor the
development cervical cancer. papillomavirus e6 gene essential for
virus-induced cellular transformation viral life cycle. important insight
into mechanism e6 function came discovery cancer-related hpv
e6 proteins promote degradation tumor suppressor p53. however,
mounting evidence indicates interaction p53 mediate e6
activities. explore p53-independent functions e6, performed yeast 
two-hybrid screen identified fibulin-1 e6 binding protein. fibulin-1 is
a calcium-binding plasma extracellular matrix protein been
implicated cellular transformation tumor invasion. interaction between
e6 fibulin-1 demonstrated vitro vivo assays. fibulin-1 
is associated specifically cancer-related hpv e6s transforming
bovine papillomavirus type 1 e6. significantly, overexpression fibulin-1
specifically inhibited e6-mediated transformation. results suggest that
fibulin-1 plays important role biological activities e6.
