the nef gene human simian immunodeficiency virus key factor in
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis virus replication. several
nef-induced phenomena, including down-regulation cd4 molecule, been
previously reported. study, identified cloned novel
cellular protein naf1 (nef-associated factor 1), associated nef the
yeast two-hybrid system pull-down assay. naf1 gene generates two isoforms
(naf1alpha beta) containing four coiled-coil structures. naf1 mrna is
ubiquitously expressed human tissues strong expression peripheral
blood lymphocytes spleen. naf1 overexpression increased cell surface cd4
expression. nef suppressed naf1-induced augmentation cd4 expression,
providing novel mode nef action cd4 down-regulation.
