the mechanism herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) establishes latency in
sensory neurons largely unknown. recent studies indicate epigenetic
modifications chromatin associated latent genome may play key
role transcriptional control lytic genes latency. study,
we found constitutive facultative types heterochromatin present
on latent hsv-1 genome. deposition facultative marks trimethyl h3k27
and histone variant macroh2a varied different sites genome, whereas the
constitutive marker trimethyl h3k9 not. addition, show the
absence latency-associated transcript (lat), latent genome shows a
dramatic increase trimethyl h3k27, suggesting expression lat
during latency may act promote appropriate heterochromatic state that
represses lytic genes still poised reactivation. due presence
of mark trimethyl h3k27, examined whether polycomb group proteins, which
methylate h3k27, present hsv-1 genome latency. data
indicate bmi1, member polycomb repressive complex 1 (prc1)
maintenance complex, associates specific sites genome, the
highest level enrichment lat enhancer. knowledge, 
first data demonstrating virus repress gene transcription enter
latency exploiting mechanism polycomb-mediated repression.
