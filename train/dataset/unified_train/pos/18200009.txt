human cells possess antiviral activity inhibits release retrovirus
particles, enveloped virus particles, antagonized hiv-1
accessory protein, vpu. antiviral activity constitutively expressed
or induced interferon-alpha, consists protein-based tethers, which
we term 'tetherins', cause retention fully formed virions infected
cell surfaces. using deductive constraints gene expression analyses, we
identify cd317 (also called bst2 hm1.24), membrane protein previously
unknown function, tetherin. specifically, cd317 expression correlated with, 
and induced, requirement vpu hiv-1 murine leukaemia virus
particle release. furthermore, cells hiv-1 virion release requires vpu
expression, depletion cd317 abolished requirement. cd317 caused retention
of virions cell surfaces and, endocytosis, cd317-positive
compartments. vpu co-localized cd317 inhibited effects. inhibition
of vpu function consequent mobilization tetherin's antiviral activity a
potential therapeutic strategy hiv/aids.
