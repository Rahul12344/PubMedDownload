cell proteins restrict replication viruses. here, identify the
cellular bclaf1 protein human cytomegalovirus restriction factor and
describe two independent mechanisms virus uses decrease steady-state
levels. immediately following infection, viral pp71 ul35 proteins, 
are delivered cells within virions, direct proteasomal degradation of
bclaf1. although bclaf1 reaccumulates middle stages infection, 
is subsequently down-regulated late times mir-ul112-1, virus-encoded
microrna. absence bclaf1 neutralization, viral gene expression and
replication inhibited. data identify two temporally mechanistically
distinct functions used human cytomegalovirus down-regulate cellular
antiviral protein.
