aim: investigate biological function f protein yeast two-hybrid
system.
methods: constructed f protein bait plasmid cloning gene f protein
into pgbkt7, recombinant plasmid dna transformed yeast ah109 (a
type). transformed yeast ah109 mated yeast y187 (alpha type)
containing liver cdna library plasmid 2xypda medium. diploid yeast plated 
on synthetic dropout nutrient medium (sd/-trp-leu-his-ade) containing x-alpha-gal
for selection screening. extracting sequencing plasmids from
positive (blue) colonies, underwent sequence analysis bioinformatics.
results: thirty-six colonies selected sequenced. among them, 11 colonies
were zymogen granule protein, 5 colonies zinc finger protein, 4 colonies
were zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, 1 colony sialyltransferase, 1 colony was
complement control protein factor i, 1 colony vitronectin, 2 colonies
were new genes unknown function.
conclusion: yeast two-hybrid system effective method identifying
hepatocyte proteins interacting f protein hepatitis c virus. f protein
may bind different proteins.
