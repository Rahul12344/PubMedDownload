previously, showed adam10 necessary hiv-1 replication primary
human macrophages immortalized cell lines. silencing adam10 expression
interrupted hiv-1 life cycle prior nuclear translocation viral cdna.
furthermore, data indicated hiv-1 replication depends expression 
of adam15 γ-secretase, proteolytically processes adam10. silencing
adam15 γ-secretase expression inhibits hiv-1 replication reverse
transcription nuclear entry. here, show adam10 expression also
supports replication cd4(+) lymphocytes. intracellular domain (icd) of
adam10 associates hiv-1 pre-integration complex (pic) cytoplasm
and immunoprecipitates co-localizes hiv-1 integrase, key component 
pic. taken together, data support model whereby adam15/γ-secretase
processing adam10 releases icd, incorporates hiv-1 pic 
facilitate nuclear trafficking. thus, studies suggest adam10 novel
therapeutic target inhibiting hiv-1 prior nuclear entry.
