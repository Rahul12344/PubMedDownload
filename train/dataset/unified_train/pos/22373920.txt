adaptation host cell environment efficiently take-over host cell's 
machinery crucial particular small rna viruses like picornaviruses that
come small rna genomes replicate exclusively cytosol. 
internal ribosome entry site (ires) elements specific rna structures that
facilitate 5' end-independent internal initiation translation under
normal conditions cap-dependent host protein synthesis shut-down 
in infected cells. longstanding issue host factors play major role
in internal initiation. here, show functionally important
domain v poliovirus ires uses trna(gly) anticodon stem-loop mimicry to
recruit glycyl-trna synthetase (gars) apical part domain v, adjacent to
the binding site key initiation factor eif4g. binding gars promotes
the accommodation initiation region ires mrna binding site
of ribosome, thereby greatly enhancing activity ires step
of 48s initiation complex formation. moonlighting functions gars may 
be additionally needed events virus-host cell interaction are
discussed.
