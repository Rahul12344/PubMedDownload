the arfp/f protein synthesized +1 reading frame hepatitis c
virus (hcv) core protein gene. function protein remains unknown. to
study function hcv arfp/f protein, conducted yeast
two-hybrid screening experiment identify cellular proteins may interact
with arfp/f protein. mm-1, c-myc interacting protein, found interact
with hcv arfp/f protein experiment. physical interaction between
arfp/f mm-1 proteins confirmed gst pull-down assay, the
co-immunoprecipitation assay confocal microscopy. mm-1 inhibit the
gene transactivation activity c-myc, conducted analysis to
examine possible effect arfp/f protein c-myc. results indicate 
that hcv arfp/f protein enhance gene trans-activation activity of
c-myc, apparently antagonizing inhibitory effect mm-1. ability of
the arfp/f protein enhance activity c-myc raises possibility that
arfp/f protein might play role hepatocellular transformation hcv
patients.
