reactivation epstein-barr virus latency dependent expression of
the viral bzlf1 protein. bzlf1 promoter (zp) normally exhibits low basal
activity activated response chemical inducers as
12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate calcium ionophore. found that
transducer regulated camp-response element-binding protein (creb) (torc) 2
enhances zp activity 10-fold 100-fold co-expression the
bzlf1 protein. mutational analysis zp revealed activation torc 
dependent zii ziii cis elements, binding sites creb family
transcriptional factors bzlf1 protein, respectively. immunoprecipitation,
chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter assay using gal4-luc gal4bd-bzlf1
fusion protein indicate torc2 interacts bzlf1, complex 
efficiently recruited onto zp. observations clearly indicate torc2
activates promoter interaction bzlf1 protein well creb
family transcriptional factors. induction lytic replication resulted in
the translocation torc2 cytoplasm viral replication compartments in
nuclei, furthermore, activation zp torc2 augmented by
calcium-regulated phosphatase, calcineurin. silencing endogenous torc2 gene
expression rna interference decreased levels bzlf1 protein in
response 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate/ionophore. based these
results, conclude epstein-barr virus exploits calcineurin-torc
signaling pathway interactions torc bzlf1 protein in
reactivation latency.
