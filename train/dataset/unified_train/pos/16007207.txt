hepatitis c virus (hcv) major risk factor human hepatocellular carcinoma
(hcc) mechanisms underlying hcv-induced carcinogenesis still poorly
understood. hypothesized viral variants, selected long-term
infection, might contribute cellular transformation. address issue, we
have investigated effect natural hcv core variants isolated liver
tumors (t), non-tumor (nt) counterparts, tumor growth factor-beta
(tgf-beta) pathway, major regulator cellular proliferation, differentiation 
and apoptosis. found significant reduction tgf-beta reporter gene
activity expression core sequences isolated liver tumors. in
contrast, moderate effects observed non-tumor mutants core
reference sequence. molecular mechanisms characterized involved
the inhibition, tumor-derived cores, dna-binding activity the
smad3/4 transcription factors complex. inhibition occurs direct
interaction central domain (amino acids 59-126) tumor-derived core
and mh1 dna-binding domain smad3, thus preventing binding dna. we
have therefore identified new cell-signaling pathway targeted hcv core and
inhibited tumor-derived core sequences. results suggest during
chronic infection, selection viral variants may promote cell
transformation providing, clonally expanding cells, resistance tgf-beta 
antiproliferative effects.
