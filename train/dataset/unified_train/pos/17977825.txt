cervical cancers transformed high risk human papilloma virus (hpv) express the
e7 oncoprotein, accelerates degradation retinoblastoma protein
(rb). show e7-mediated degradation rb requires the
calcium-activated cysteine protease, calpain. e7 bound activated mu-calpain
and promoted cleavage rb(810), mutation residue preventing
e7-mediated degradation. calpain cleavage product, rb(1-810), unable to
mediate cell cycle arrest retained ability repress e6/e7
transcription. e7 also promoted accelerated proteasomal degradation of
rb(1-810). calpain inhibitors reduced viability hpv-transformed cells 
synergized cisplatin. calpain, thus, emerges central player in
e7-mediated degradation rb represents potential new drug target 
treatment hpv-associated lesions.
