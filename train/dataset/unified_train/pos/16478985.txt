the ul69 gene product human cytomegalovirus belongs family regulatory 
proteins conserved among herpesviruses part characterized
as posttranscriptional transactivators participating nuclear export of
rna. recent experiments suggested pul69 also acts posttranscriptional
activator since demonstrated nucleocytoplasmic shuttling via a
crm1-independent nuclear export signal prerequisite stimulatory
effect gene expression. based findings initiated studies to
investigate role pul69 mrna export demonstrate pul69
efficiently promotes cytoplasmic accumulation unspliced rna. furthermore, 
we show pul69 activity linked cellular mrna export machinery 
by direct protein interaction highly related dexd/h-box rna helicases
uap56 urh49. particularly, identified 12-amino-acid domain within n 
terminus pul69 required binding uap56 urh49, could 
demonstrate uap56 interaction nucleocytoplasmic shuttling both
prerequisites pul69-mediated mrna export. thus, identified novel
cellular target provides herpesviral regulatory protein access 
conserved cellular transport system order promote nuclear export of
unspliced rna.
