barrier-to-autointegration factor (baf) conserved human chromatin protein
exploited retroviruses. previous investigators showed baf binds
double-stranded dna nonspecifically host component preintegration
complexes (pics) isolated cells infected human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (hiv-1) moloney murine leukemia virus. baf protects pic structure and
stimulates integration salt-stripped pics target dna vitro. pics
are thought acquire baf cytoplasm infection. however, we
identified two human tissues (of 16 tested) baf mrna detected:
thymus peripheral blood leukocytes, enriched cd4(+) t
lymphocytes macrophage precursors, respectively. baf protein detected 
activated resting cd4(+) lymphocytes; thus, baf essential for
pic function, hypothesized virions might "bring baf."
supporting model, baf copurified hiv-1 virions digested 
subtilisin remove microvesicle contaminants, baf present in
approximately zero three copies per virion. three independent assays, baf
bound directly p55 gag (the structural precursor hiv-1 virions) and
its cleaved product, matrix. using lysates cells overexpressing gag,
endogenous baf gag coimmunoprecipitated antibodies gag.
purified recombinant baf low micromolar affinities (1.1 1.4 micro m) for
recombinant gag matrix. conclude baf present low levels in
incoming virions, addition acquired cytoplasm newly
infected cells. conclude baf might contribute assembly 
activity hiv-1 pics direct binding matrix, well dna.
