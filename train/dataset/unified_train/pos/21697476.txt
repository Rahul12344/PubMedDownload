the epstein-barr virus (ebv) latent-to-lytic switch essential part the
viral life cycle, cellular factors promote viral reactivation are
not well defined. report, demonstrate cellular transcription 
factor oct-1 cooperates ebv immediate-early protein brlf1 (r, rta) to
induce lytic viral reactivation. show cotransfected oct-1 enhances the
ability brlf1 activate lytic gene expression 293 cells stably infected
with brlf1-defective ebv mutant (brlf1-stop) oct-1 increases
brlf1-mediated activation lytic ebv promoters reporter gene assays. find
that oct-1 interacts directly brlf1 vitro mutant brlf1 protein
(the m140a mutant) attenuated ability interact oct-1 vitro 
also resistant oct-1-mediated transcriptional enhancement 293 brlf1-stop
cells. furthermore, show cotransfected oct-1 augments brlf1 binding 
variety lytic ebv promoters chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays
(including bzlf1, bmrf1, sm promoters) brlf1 tethers oct-1 to
lytic ebv promoters. addition, demonstrate oct-1 mutant defective
in dna binding (the s335d mutant) still retains ability enhance brlf1
transcriptional effects. finally, show knockdown endogenous oct-1
expression reduces level constitutive lytic ebv gene expression both
ebv-positive b-cell ebv-positive epithelial cell lines. results suggest
that oct-1 acts positive regulator ebv lytic gene expression that
this effect least partially mediated interaction viral
protein brlf1.
