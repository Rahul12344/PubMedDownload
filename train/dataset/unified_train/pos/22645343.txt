the natural history hiv-1 infection highly variable different
individuals, spanning rapidly progressive course long-term
asymptomatic infection. major determinant pace disease progression is
the vivo level hiv-1 replication, regulated complex network
of cytokines chemokines expressed immune inflammatory cells. the
chemokine system critically involved control hiv-1 replication by
virtue role played specific chemokine receptors, notably ccr5 
cxcr4, cell-surface coreceptors hiv-1 entry; hence, chemokines that
naturally bind coreceptors act endogenous inhibitors hiv-1. here, we
show cxc chemokine cxcl4 (pf-4), abundant protein contained
within Î±-granules platelets, broad-spectrum inhibitor hiv-1
infection. unlike known hiv-suppressive chemokines, cxcl4 inhibits
infection majority primary hiv-1 isolates regardless their
coreceptor-usage phenotype genetic subtype. consistent lack viral 
phenotype specificity, blockade hiv-1 infection occurs level virus
attachment entry via unique mechanism involves direct interaction of
cxcl4 major viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120. binding site for
cxcl4 mapped region gp120 outer domain proximal the
cd4-binding site. identification platelet-derived chemokine an
endogenous antiviral factor may relevance pathogenesis treatment
of hiv-1 infection.
