previous reports strongly suggest that, addition nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor, rabies virus use other, as-yet-unidentified
receptors. found laboratory cell lines susceptible rabies virus
infection express neural cell adhesion molecule (ncam) (cd56) their
surface, whereas resistant cells not, supporting idea ncam could a
rabies virus receptor. observed (i) incubation rabies virus
decreases surface expression ncam; (ii) treatment susceptible cells
with heparan sulfate, ligand ncam, ncam antibodies significantly
reduces rabies virus infection; (iii) preincubation rabies virus
inoculum soluble ncam protein receptor decoy drastically neutralizes
the capacity rabies virus infect susceptible cells. moreover, we
demonstrated transfection resistant l fibroblasts ncam-encoding 
gene induces rabies virus susceptibility whereas absence ncam primary
cortical cell cultures prepared ncam-deficient mice reduces rabies virus
infection virus production. provides evidence ncam vitro
receptor rabies virus. moreover, vivo relevance use of
ncam receptor demonstrated infection ncam-deficient mice, in
which rabies mortality delayed brain invasion rabies virus was
drastically restricted. results showed ncam, expressed mainly
in adult nervous system, plays important role rabies infection.
however, cannot excluded receptors ncam utilized. thus,
the description ncam new rabies virus receptor would another example
of use viruses one receptor gain entry host.
