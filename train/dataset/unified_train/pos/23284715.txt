hiv-1 nef protein contributes essentially pathology aids variety
of protein-protein-interactions within host cell. versatile functionality
of nef partially attributed different conformational states and
posttranslational modifications, myristoylation. now, many
interaction partners nef identified using classical yeast two-hybrid
screens. screens rely transcriptional activation reporter genes the
nucleus detect interactions. thus, identification nef interaction
partners integral membrane proteins, membrane-associated proteins or
other proteins translocate nucleus hampered. the
present study, split-ubiquitin based yeast two-hybrid screen used to
identify novel membrane-localized interaction partners nef. 80% of
the hereby identified interaction partners nef transmembrane proteins. the
identified hits gpm6b, gpm6a, bap31, tspan7, cyb5b, cd320/tcblr, vsig4,
pmepa1, ociad1, itgb1, chn1, ph4, cldn10, hspa9, apr-3, pebp1 b3gnt, which
are involved diverse cellular processes like signaling, apoptosis,
neurogenesis, cell adhesion protein trafficking quality control. a
subfraction hereby identified proteins present data supporting their
direct interaction hiv-1 nef. discuss results respect many
phenotypes observed hiv infected cells patients. identified nef
interaction partners may help elucidate molecular basis of
hiv-related diseases.
