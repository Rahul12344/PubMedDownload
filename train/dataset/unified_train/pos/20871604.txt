viral infection triggers innate immune sensors produce type interferon.
however, infection cells macrophages human immunodeficiency virus
(hiv) trip alarms. hiv avoids activating nucleic acid sensors 
is unknown. found cytosolic exonuclease trex1 suppressed
interferon triggered hiv. trex1(-/-) mouse cells human cd4(+) cells
and macrophages trex1 inhibited rna-mediated interference,
cytosolic hiv dna accumulated hiv infection induced type interferon that
inhibited hiv replication spreading. trex1 bound cytosolic hiv dna and
digested excess hiv dna would otherwise activate interferon expression via a
pathway dependent kinase tbk1, adaptor sting transcription
factor irf3. hiv-stimulated interferon production cells deficient trex1 did
not involve known nucleic acid sensors.
