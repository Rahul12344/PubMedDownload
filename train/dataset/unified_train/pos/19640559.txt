herpesviruses must cross inner nuclear membrane underlying lamina exit
the nucleus. hsv-1 us3 pkc phosphorylate lamins induce their
dispersion elicit phosphorylated lamin species produced
during infection. ul13 serine threonine protein kinase conserved among many 
herpesviruses. hsv-1 ul13 phosphorylates us3 thereby controls ul31 ul34
nuclear rim localization, indicating role nuclear egress. here, report
that hsv-2 ul13 alone induced conformational changes lamins c and
redistributed lamin b1 nuclear rim intranuclear granular structures. 
hsv-2 ul13 directly phosphorylated lamins a, c, b1 vitro, lamin a1
tail domain. hsv-2 infection recapitulated lamin alterations seen upon
expression ul13 alone, alterations also observed, indicating
that additional viral and/or cellular proteins cooperate ul13 alter
lamins hsv-2 infection allow nuclear egress.
