reduction intramolecular disulfides hiv-1 envelope protein gp120 occurs
after binding cd4 receptor. protein disulfide isomerase (pdi)
catalyzes disulfide reduction vitro inhibition enzyme blocks
viral entry. pdi belongs thioredoxin protein superfamily also
includes human glutaredoxin-1 (grx1). grx1 secreted cells protein
has also found within hiv-1 virion. show grx1 efficiently
catalyzes gp120, cd4 disulfide reduction vitro, even low plasma levels 
of glutathione. grx1 catalyzes reduction two disulfide bridges gp120 in
a similar manner pdi. purified anti-grx1 antibodies shown inhibit 
grx1 activity vitro block hiv-1 replication cultured peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. also, polyanion pro2000, previously shown to
prevent hiv entry, inhibits grx1- pdi-dependent reduction gp120
disulfides. findings suggest grx1 activity important hiv-1 entry 
and grx1 gp120 intramolecular disulfides novel pharmacological
targets rational drug development.
