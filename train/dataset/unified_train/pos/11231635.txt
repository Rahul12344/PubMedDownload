epstein-barr virus (ebv) oncogenic virus associated number human 
malignancies including burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
lymphoproliferative disease and, though still debated, breast carcinoma. subset
of latent ebv antigens required mediating immortalization primary
b-lymphocytes. demonstrate carboxy-terminal region the
essential latent antigen, ebna-3c, interacts specifically human
metastatic suppressor protein nm23-h1. moreover, ebna-3c reverses ability 
nm23-h1 suppress migration burkitt lymphoma cells breast carcinoma 
cells. propose ebna-3c contributes ebv-associated human cancers by
targeting altering role metastasis suppressor nm23-h1.
