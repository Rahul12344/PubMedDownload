background: actin required gene expression morphogenesis of
respiratory syncytial virus (rsv), clinically important pneumovirus the
paramyxoviridae family. hep-2 cells, rsv infection also induces actin stress
fibers, may important immunopathology rsv disease.
profilin, major regulator actin polymerization, stimulates viral
transcription vitro. thus, tested role profilin rsv growth and
rsv-actin interactions cultured cells (ex vivo).
results: tested three cell lines: hep-2 (human), a549 (human), l2 (rat).
in three, rsv grew well produced fused cells (syncytium), two rsv
proteins, namely, phosphoprotein p nucleocapsid protein n, associated
with profilin. contrast, induction actin stress fibers rsv occurred in
hep-2 l2 cells, a549. knockdown profilin rna interference
had small effect viral macromolecule synthesis strongly inhibited
maturation progeny virions, cell fusion, induction stress fibers.
conclusions: profilin plays cardinal role rsv-mediated cell fusion viral
maturation. contrast, interaction profilin viral transcriptional
proteins p n may nominally activate viral rna-dependent rna polymerase. 
stress fiber formation cell-specific response infection, requiring
profilin perhaps signaling molecules absent certain cell
lines. stress fibers per se play role rsv replication cell culture.
clearly, cellular architecture controls multiple steps host-rsv
interaction, regulated profilin.
