repression transcription full-length e2 protein papillomaviruses
(pv) seems occur e2 binding sites positively acting
cellular factors overlap. previously, showed runx1 (formerly called cbf) 
binds repression-mediating e2 binding site p2 human pv type 8 (hpv8).
by yeast one-hybrid system could identify unknown protein binding also to
p2, tentatively called pbf (papillomavirus binding factor). pbf recognizes the
sequence ccgg, represents 3' half e2 binding site adjacent 
to runx1 motif. pbf also binds repression-mediating e2 bs-1 bpv1,
which conserved p2 hpv8. point mutations destroying pbf binding hpv8 
p2 bpv-1 e2 bs-1 vitro reduce promoter activity corresponding reporter 
constructs. results suggest pbf might play role transcription pv
genes e2-mediated repression.
