kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) latent genomes tethered to
host histones form minichromosome also known "episome." histones,
which core components chromatin, heavily modified various
histone-targeting enzymes. posttranslational modifications histones
significantly influence accessibility transcriptional factors thus have
profound effects gene expression. recent studies showed epigenetic marks 
on kshv episome well organized, exemplified absence histone h3 
lysine 9 (h3k9) methylation, heterochromatic histone mark, immediate early
and latent gene promoters naturally infected cells. present study revealed
a mechanistic insight kshv epigenome regulation via complex consisting 
lana h3k9me1/2 histone demethylase jmjd1a/kdm3a. complex was
isolated hela cell nuclear extracts stably expressing lana verified 
by coimmunoprecipitation analyses purified proteins. lana recruitment
sites kshv genome inversely correlated h3k9me2 histone marks in
naturally infected cells, methylation h3k9 significantly inhibited lana
binding histone h3 tail. chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled kshv
tiling arrays identified recruitment sites complex, depletion of
lana expression overexpression kdm3a binding-deficient mutant decreased
kdm3a recruitment kshv genome. finally, ablation kdm3a expression 
latently kshv-infected cells significantly inhibited kshv gene expression,
leading decreased kshv replication reactivation. taken together, our
results suggest lana may play role regulation epigenetic marks on
the kshv genome, part association histone
demethylase kdm3a.
