hepatitis c virus (hcv) highly dependent cellular factors own
propagation. employing tandem affinity purification method, identified
pyruvate carboxylase (pc) cellular partner ns5a protein. ns5a interacted
with pc n-terminal region ns5a biotin carboxylase domain
of pc. pc expression decreased cells expressing ns5a hcv-infected
cells. promoter activity pc also decreased ns5a protein. however, fas
expression increased cells expressing ns5a cell culture grown hcv
(hcvcc)-infected cells. silencing pc promoted fatty acid synthase (fas)
expression level. data suggest hcv may modulate pc via ns5a protein its
own propagation.
