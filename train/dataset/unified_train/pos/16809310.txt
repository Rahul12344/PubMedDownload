human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) tax protein activates viral
transcription long terminal repeats (ltr). mechanisms tax 
activates ltr established, coactivators process remain to
be identified characterized. show three members torc 
family transcriptional regulators coactivators tax ltr-driven
expression. torc coactivation requires creb, atf4 bzip factors. 
tax physically interacts torc1, torc2, torc3 (torc1/2/3), the
depletion torc1/2/3 inhibited tax activity. torc coactivation further
enhanced transcriptional coactivator p300. addition, coactivators the
p300 family required full activity tax independently torc1/2/3.
thus, torc p300 families coactivators essential optimal
activation htlv-1 transcription tax.
