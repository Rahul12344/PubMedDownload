the hepatitis b virus core protein consists amino-terminal capsid-assembly 
domain carboxyl-terminal rna-binding domain. using yeast two-hybrid 
system, two hsp40/dnaj chaperone-family proteins, hdj1 htid1, interact
with carboxyl-terminal region (aa 94-185) core protein were
identified. hdj1 prototype member family htid1 human
homologue drosophila tumour-suppressor protein tid56. binding viral
core protein hsp40 proteins confirmed affinity chromatography and
immunoprecipitation transiently expressed proteins. moreover, sucrose
gradient, precursor form htid1 co-sedimented capsid-like particles
composed full-length core protein. unlike general perception the
role cellular chaperone proteins assisting viral protein folding and
thus enhancing virus replication, ectopic expression hdj1 htid1 suppressed
replication hbv transfected human hepatoma cells. conversely, rna
interference-mediated knock-down htid1 resulted increased hbv replication. 
it found hsp40 proteins specifically accelerated degradation the
viral core hbx proteins. results suggest cellular chaperones,
through destabilization viral proteins, exert inhibitory functions virus
replication hence may play suppressive roles hepatocellular carcinoma.
