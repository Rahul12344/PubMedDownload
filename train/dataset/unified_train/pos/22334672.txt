the herpes simplex virus icp27 protein important expression and
nuclear export viral mrnas. although several binding sites mapped
along icp27 sequence various rna protein partners, including the
transport receptor tap host cell nuclear transport machinery, several
aspects icp27 trafficking nuclear pore complex remain unclear. 
investigated icp27 could interact directly nuclear pore complex
itself, finding icp27 directly binds core nucleoporin nup62. is
confirmed co-immunoprecipitation vitro binding assays with
purified components. mapping icp27 deletion point mutants shows 
that interaction requires sequences n c termini icp27.
expression wild type icp27 protein inhibited classical, importin
α/β-dependent transportin-dependent nuclear import. contrast, icp27
point mutant interact nup62 inhibitory effect. 
suggest icp27 association nup62 provides additional binding sites at
the nuclear pore icp27 shuttling, thus supporting icp27-mediated transport.
we propose icp27 competes host cell transport receptors for
binding, resulting inhibition host transport pathways.
