the influenza virus pb1-f2 87-amino acid mitochondrial protein that
previously shown induce cell death, although mechanism of
apoptosis induction remained unclear. process characterizing its
mechanism action found viral pb1-f2 protein sensitizes cells to
apoptotic stimuli tumor necrosis factor alpha, demonstrated by
increased cleavage caspase 3 substrates pb1-f2-expressing cells. moreover, 
treatment purified mouse liver mitochondria recombinant pb1-f2 protein
resulted cytochrome c release, loss mitochondrial membrane potential,
and enhancement tbid-induced mitochondrial permeabilization, suggesting a
possible mechanism observed cellular sensitization apoptosis. using
glutathione-s-transferase pulldowns subsequent mass spectrometric analysis, 
we identified mitochondrial interactors pb1-f2 protein showed that
the viral protein uniquely interacts inner mitochondrial membrane
adenine nucleotide translocator 3 outer mitochondrial membrane
voltage-dependent anion channel 1, implicated the
mitochondrial permeability transition apoptosis. consistent this
interaction, blockers permeability transition pore complex (ptpc)
inhibited pb1-f2-induced mitochondrial permeabilization. based findings,
we propose model whereby proapoptotic pb1-f2 protein acts the
mitochondrial ptpc may play role down-regulation host immune 
response infection.
