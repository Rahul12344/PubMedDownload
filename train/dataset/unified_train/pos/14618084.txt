kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv)/human herpes virus type 8 (hhv-8) 
is tightly linked development kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion
lymphoma (pel) cases multicentric castleman's disease.
latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) one limited number kshv
genes consistently expressed diseases well kshv-infected cell
lines derived pel, shown play crucial role persistence of
kshv genomes infected cells. study, explored cellular
factors interact lana using yeast two-hybrid screening, isolated 
part gene encoding human myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen (mnda). 
mnda hematopoietic interferon-inducible nuclear proteins hin-200
family member conserved 200-amino acid repeats. immunoprecipitation assay
revealed lana interacted mnda mammalian embryonic kidney cell
line. mnda transcript undetectable three pel cell lines by
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, induced interferon
alpha (ifnalpha). moreover, lana mnda co-localized nuclei of
mnda-expressing pel cells. results suggest lana interacts mnda in
kshv-infected cells exposed ifnalpha. interaction may modulate
ifn-mediated host defense activities.
