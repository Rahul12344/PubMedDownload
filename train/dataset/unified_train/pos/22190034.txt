human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) small genome therefore relies
heavily host cellular machinery replicate. identifying host
proteins complexes come physical contact viral proteins is
crucial comprehensive understanding hiv rewires host's cellular 
machinery course infection. report use affinity
tagging purification mass spectrometry determine systematically the
physical interactions 18 hiv-1 proteins polyproteins host
proteins two different human cell lines (hek293 jurkat). using a
quantitative scoring system call mist, identified high confidence
497 hiv-human protein-protein interactions involving 435 individual human
proteins, ∼40% interactions identified cell types. we
found host proteins hijacked hiv, especially found interacting 
in cell types, highly conserved across primates. uncovered number
of host complexes targeted viral proteins, including finding hiv
protease cleaves eif3d, subunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3. 
this host protein one eleven identified analysis act to
inhibit hiv replication. data set facilitates comprehensive and
detailed understanding host machinery manipulated course
of hiv infection.
