kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (kshv), etiologic agent kaposi's
sarcoma, body cavity based lymphoma multicentric castleman's disease,
establishes lifelong latency infected cells. kshv genome tethers the
host chromosome help latency associated nuclear antigen (lana).
additionally, lana supports replication latent origins within terminal
repeats recruiting cellular factors. previous studies identified and
characterized another latent origin, supported replication plasmids 
ex-vivo without lana expression trans. therefore identification an
additional origin site prompted us analyze entire kshv genome for
replication initiation sites using single molecule analysis replicated dna
(smard). results showed replication dna initiate throughout the
kshv genome usage regions conserved two different kshv
strains investigated. smard also showed utilization multiple
replication initiation sites occurs across large regions genome rather
than specified sequence. replication origin terminal repeats showed 
only slight preference usage indicating lana dependent origin at
the terminal repeats (tr) plays limited role genome duplication.
furthermore, performed chromatin immunoprecipitation orc2 mcm3, 
are part pre-replication initiation complex determine genomic sites
where proteins accumulate, provide characterization potential
replication initiation sites kshv genome. chip data confirmed
accumulation pre-rc proteins multiple genomic sites cell cycle
dependent manner. data also show frequency sites of
replication initiation vary within two kshv genomes studied here, suggesting 
that initiation replication likely affected genomic context
rather dna sequences.
