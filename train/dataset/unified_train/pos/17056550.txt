in contrast mhc molecules, present peptides, cd1 molecules been
discovered present lipid ags cells. cd1-restricted lymphocytes have
been recently associated resistance virus infection. mechanisms
underlying activation cd1-restricted cells course virus infection 
are defined. study, wanted investigate interaction hsv
with antiviral cd1 ag presentation system human dendritic cells (dc). in
response low titers hsv, surface expression cd1b cd1d human
dc up-regulated. phenotypic changes enhanced capacity infected
dc stimulate proliferation cd1-restricted lymphocytes. high titers of
hsv, however, lead strong down-regulation surface cd1 molecules. this
modulation surface expression associated intracellular accumulation, 
colocalization viral proteins, disruption cd1 recycling
machinery. finally, even low titers hsv interfered capacity of
infected dc stimulate release important cytokines cd1d-restricted
nkt cells. thus, demonstrate existence cd1 pathway allowing
human dc react viral infection, well blockage human
herpesvirus.
