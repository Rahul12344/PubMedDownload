chronic hepatitis b virus infection (chb) caused hepatitis b virus (hbv)
is one common viral infections world. reactivation hbv
infection life-threatening condition observed patients chb receiving
chemotherapy medications. although hbv reactivation commonly
attributed immune suppression, factors long suspected play 
a role, including intracellular signaling activated response dna damage. we
investigated effects dna-damaging factors (doxorubicin hydrogen
peroxide) hbv reactivation/replication consequent dna-damage response.
dose-dependent activation hbv replication observed response to
doxorubicin hydrogen peroxide associated marked elevation in
the mrna levels ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (atm) atm- rad3-related 
(atr) kinases. downregulation atm atr expression shrnas substantially
reduced levels hbv rnas dna. contrast, transcriptional activation
of atm atr using crispra significantly increased hbv replication. conclude 
that atm atr essential hbv replication. furthermore, dna damage
leading activation atm atr transcription, results the
reactivation hbv replication.
