human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression modulated 
viral cellular factors. regulatory element hiv-1 long terminal
repeat known tar, extends nucleotides -18 +80, critical for
the activation gene expression transactivator protein, tat. rna
transcribed tar forms stable stem-loop structure serves the
binding site tat cellular factors. although tar rna critical 
tat activation, role tar dna plays regulating hiv-1 gene expression
is clear. several studies demonstrated tar dna bind cellular
proteins, ubp-1/lbp-1, repress hiv-1 gene expression other
factors involved generation short, nonprocessive transcripts.
in attempt characterize additional cellular factors bind tar dna, a
lambda gt11 expression cloning strategy involving use portion tar dna
extending -18 +28 probe hela cdna library used. identified 
cdna, designated tar dna-binding protein (tdp-43), encodes cellular
factor 43 kda binds specifically pyrimidine-rich motifs tar.
antibody tdp-43 used gel retardation assays demonstrate that
endogenous tdp-43, present hela nuclear extract, also bound tar dna.
although tdp-43 bound strongly double-stranded tar dna via its
ribonucleoprotein protein-binding motifs, bind tar rna extending
from +1 +80. determine function tdp-43 regulating hiv-1 gene
expression, vitro transcription analysis performed. tdp-43 repressed in
vitro transcription hiv-1 long terminal repeat presence 
absence tat, repress transcription promoters as
the adenovirus major late promoter. addition, transfection vector which
expressed tdp-43 resulted repression gene expression hiv-1
provirus. results indicate tdp-43 capable modulating in
vitro vivo hiv-1 gene expression either altering blocking the
assembly transcription complexes capable responding tat.
