hepatitis c virus (hcv) leading cause liver disease worldwide. âˆ¼170 
million individuals infected current interferon-based treatment toxic 
side effects marginal efficacy, effective antivirals crucially
needed. although hcv protease inhibitors approved us food and
drug administration (fda), optimal hcv therapy, analogous hiv therapy, will
probably require combination antivirals targeting multiple aspects the
viral lifecycle. viral entry represents potential multifaceted target for
antiviral intervention; however, date, fda-approved inhibitors hcv cell
entry unavailable. show cellular niemann-pick c1-like 1
(npc1l1) cholesterol uptake receptor hcv entry factor amendable to
therapeutic intervention. specifically, npc1l1 expression necessary hcv
infection, silencing antibody-mediated blocking npc1l1 impairs cell
culture-derived hcv (hcvcc) infection initiation. addition, clinically
available fda-approved npc1l1 antagonist ezetimibe potently blocks hcv uptake 
vitro via virion cholesterol-dependent step virion-cell membrane fusion.
moreover, ezetimibe inhibits infection major hcv genotypes vitro in
vivo delays establishment hcv genotype 1b infection mice human
liver grafts. thus, identified npc1l1 hcv cell entry
factor also discovered new antiviral target potential therapeutic
agent.
