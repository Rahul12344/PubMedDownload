the binding e2f adenovirus (ad) e2a promoter stimulated ad
e4-6/7 protein. e2f dna binding activity composed heterodimer related 
but distinct proteins e2f-1 dp-1 families. e4-6/7 protein induces 
the cooperative stable binding e2f inverted repeat binding site in
the e2a promoter apparently providing dimerization interface two adjacent
e2f heterodimers. product retinoblastoma gene product (rb) represses
the transcriptional activity e2f direct protein-protein interaction. in
this report, examined regions e2f-1 dp-1 required for
the induction cooperative e2f binding e2a promoter e4-6/7
protein. results demonstrate internal segment e2f-1, is
conserved among members e2f family, required functional interaction
with e4-6/7 product. consistent observation, members the
e2f family (e2f-2 e2f-3) productively interact e4-6/7. dp-1 also is
necessary stable interaction e4-6/7 internal segment dp-1 is
required positioned location similar conserved e2f-1 
domain. interestingly, binding e4-6/7 binding rb e2f are
mutually exclusive, results show internal segments e2f-1
and dp-1 required e4-6/7 binding also required stable
interaction rb. results suggest ad e4-6/7 protein mimics rb
in part protein interaction requirements e2f binding, although with
different functional consequences. rb binding represses e2f activity, the
e4-6/7 protein stimulates transactivation ad e2a promoter.
