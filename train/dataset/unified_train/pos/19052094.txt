a tight junction (tj) protein, claudin-1 (cldn1), identified recently a
key factor hepatitis c virus (hcv) entry. here, show another tj
protein, occludin, also required hcv entry. mutational study cldn1
revealed tight junctional distribution plays important role in
mediating viral entry. together, data support model hcv enters
liver cells tj. interestingly, hcv infection huh-7 hepatoma cells
downregulated expression cldn1 occludin, preventing superinfection.
the altered tj protein expression may contribute morphological and
functional changes observed hcv-infected hepatocytes.
