we previously showed reduced infectivity hiv incompletely processed 
capsid-spacer protein 1 (ca-sp1) rescued cellular activation increased
expression hsp90ab1, member cytosolic heat shock protein 90 family.
here show hsp90ab1 present hiv virions hsp90ab1, not
nonfunctional mutated hsp90ab1(e42a+d88a), restores infectivity hiv with
mutations ca alter core stability. further, ca mutants were
hypersensitive pharmacological inhibition hsp90ab1. agreement with
roesch et al. (2012), found culturing hiv 39.5°c enhanced viral
infectivity 30-fold human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (p=0.002)
and rescued ca-mutant infectivity nonactivated cells, concurrent elevated
expression hsp90ab1 hyperthermia. sum, transdominant effect of
hsp90ab1 ca-mutant hiv infectivity suggests potential role class of
cellular chaperones hiv core stability uncoating.
