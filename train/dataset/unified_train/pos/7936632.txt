tax protein human cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) enhances transcription
of several cellular genes activation specific enhancer, nf-kappa
b binding site. found previously tax binds nf-kappa b p50, 
member rel/nf-kappa b family proteins, associates dna
sequence nf-kappa b binding site. present study, tested other
nf-kappa b family proteins found nf-kappa b p65 c-rel proteins also 
bind tax complexes tax bind dna sequence the
nf-kappa b binding site. tax binding site nf-kappa b p50 rel
homology domain, conserved rel/nf-kappa b family proteins. the
formations complexes tax mutants well correlated their
transactivating capacities. f9 embryonic carcinoma cells, tax enhanced
transcription synergistically nf-kappa b p65 c-rel. thus tax interacts
with rel homology domain rel/nf-kappa b family proteins bind 
nf-kappa b binding site activates transcription.
