in vitro incubation human cytomegalovirus (towne strain) 8 u/ml human
recombinant myeloperoxidase plus sodium chloride glucose nearly abolished
viral infectivity. assay effect intracellular infection, cell toxicity 
of enzymes first studied. even high dose 16 u/ml recombinant
myeloperoxidase plus 10 mu/ml glucose oxidase decrease mrc5 cell growth. 
by contrast, dose reduced proliferation activated thp1 cells. even half
of myeloperoxidase dose proved slightly toxic cells. non-cytotoxic
concentrations reagents used monitor effect on
cytomegalovirus infection. mrc5 cells, even low dose 4 u/ml
myeloperoxidase plus glucose oxidase inhibited synthesis cytomegalovirus early
antigens, tested immunofluorescence. viral release supernatant was
decreased 4 logs. thp1 cells, produce endogenously hydrogen peroxide,
myeloperoxidase alone (8 u/ml) decreased formation early late antigens
by 53 44%, respectively.
