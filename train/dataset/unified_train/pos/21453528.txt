evidence suggests genome chromatinization posttranslational
modification histones involved regulation viral gene expression,
including human cytomegalovirus (hcmv). performed chip-on-chip assay 
determine whether histone deacetylases (hdacs) interact hcmv genomic dna 
a global level. surprisingly, found hdac3, hdac2, interacts not
only major immediate early (mie) promoter also entire mie
locus, suggesting heterogeneous interaction hdac3 hcmv dna. the
interaction hdac3 mie region related inhibition viral
replication hdac3 inhibitors enhanced hcmv replication.
