canine parvovirus (cpv) relative feline panleukopenia virus (fpv) bind
the transferrin receptor type 1 (tfr) infect host cells show
differences interactions feline canine tfrs determine
viral host range tissue tropism. changed apical protease-like domain
residues introducing point mutations adding removing glycosylation
signals, examined interactions mutant tfrs the
capsids. substitutions little effect virus binding uptake.
however, mutations several sites apical domain receptor either
prevented binding capsids reduced affinity receptor binding to
various degrees. glycans within virus binding face apical domain also 
controlled capsid binding. cpv, related feline parvovirus, could use 
receptors containing canine tfr-specific glycosylation mediate efficient
infection, addition n-linked glycosylation sites virus
binding face feline apical domain reduced eliminated binding and
infection. replacement critical feline tfr residue 221 every amino acid
had effects binding infection significantly associated the
biochemical properties residue replaced. receptors reduced affinities
mostly showed proportional changes ability mediate infection. testing
feline tfr variants binding uptake patterns cells showed that
low-affinity versions bound fewer capsids also differed attachment 
cell surface filopodia, transport perinuclear endosome was
similar.
