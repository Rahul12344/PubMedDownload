varicella-zoster virus (vzv) causes chickenpox shingles. varicella is
likely spread cell-free virus susceptible hosts, virus transmitted
by cell-to-cell spread body vitro. since vzv glycoprotein e (ge) is
essential virus infection, postulated ge binds cellular
receptor. found insulin-degrading enzyme (ide) interacts ge 
its extracellular domain. downregulation ide sirna, blocking ide with
antibody, soluble ide protein extracted liver, bacitracin
inhibited vzv infection. cell-to-cell spread virus also impaired by
blocking ide. transfection cell lines impaired vzv infection a
plasmid expressing human ide resulted increased entry enhanced infection
with cell-free cell-associated virus. studies indicate ide a
cellular receptor cell-free cell-associated vzv.
