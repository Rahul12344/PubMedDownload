hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection induces wide range chronic liver injuries;
however, mechanism hcv evades immune surveillance system
remains obscure. blood dendritic cells (dcs) play pivotal role the
recognition viral infection induction innate adaptive immune
responses. several reports suggest hcv infection induces dysfunction 
dcs patients chronic hepatitis c. toll-like receptor (tlr) shown
to play various roles many viral infections; however, involvement hcv
proteins tlr signaling pathway yet precisely elucidated. in
this study, established mouse macrophage cell lines stably expressing hcv
proteins determined effect hcv proteins tlr signaling pathways.
immune cells expressing ns3, ns3/4a, ns4b, ns5a found inhibit the
activation tlr2, tlr4, tlr7, tlr9 signaling pathways. various
genotypes ns5a bound myd88, major adaptor molecule tlr, inhibited 
recruitment interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 myd88, impaired 
cytokine production response tlr ligands. amino acid residues 240 280,
previously identified interferon sensitivity-determining region (isdr) 
ns5a, interacted death domain myd88, expression mutant
ns5a lacking isdr partially restored cytokine production. results
suggest expression hcv proteins modulates tlr signaling pathway
in immune cells.
