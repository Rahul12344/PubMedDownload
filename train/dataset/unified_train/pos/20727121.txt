partitioning membrane proteins various types microdomains crucial
for many cellular functions. tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (tems) a
unique type protein-based microdomain, clearly distinct membrane rafts,
and important several cellular processes fusion, migration and
signaling. paradoxically, hiv-1 assembly/egress occurs tems, yet viral
particles also incorporate raft lipids. using different quantitative microscopy
approaches, investigated dynamic relationship tems, membrane rafts
and hiv-1 exit sites, focusing mainly tetraspanin cd9. results show
that clustering cd9 correlates multimerization major viral
structural component, gag, plasma membrane. cd9 exhibited confined
behavior reduced lateral mobility viral assembly sites, suggesting that
gag locally traps tetraspanins. contrast, raft lipid gm1 the
raft-associated protein cd55, also recruited assembly/budding sites,
were transiently trapped membrane areas. cd9 recruitment and
confinement found partially dependent cholesterol, of
cd55 completely dependent cholesterol. importantly, findings support 
the emerging concept cellular viral components, instead clustering at
preexisting microdomain platforms, direct formation distinct domains for
the execution specific functions.
