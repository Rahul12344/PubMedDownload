borna disease virus (bdv) newly classified nonsegmented negative-strand rna 
virus (order mononegavirales) persistently infects specific brain regions
and circuits warm-blooded animals cause behavioral disturbances. viruses
within order mononegavirales phosphoproteins typically serve 
transcription factors modulated functional activity through
phosphorylation. identify kinases involved bdv phosphoprotein (bdv-p)
phosphorylation, vitro phosphorylation assays performed using recombinant
phosphoprotein produced escherichia coli substrate cytoplasmic extracts
from rat glioma cell line (c6) rat brain extracts sources kinase
activity. experiments revealed bdv-p phosphorylated predominantly 
by protein kinase c (pkc) lesser extent casein kinase ii. partial
purification pkc rat brain extract suggested bdv-p
phosphorylating kinase pkcepsilon. role pkc phosphorylation vivo 
confirmed using pkc-specific inhibitor gf109203x. furthermore, peptide
mapping studies indicated bdv-p phosphorylated sites vitro
as vivo. mutational analysis identified ser26 ser28 sites pkc
phosphorylation ser70 ser86 sites casein kinase ii
phosphorylation. anatomic distribution pkcepsilon central nervous
system may implications bdv neurotropism pathogenesis.
