phosphorylation hepatitis b virus (hbv) core protein recently shown
to prerequisite pregenomic rna encapsidation viral capsids, the
host cell kinases mediating essential step hbv replication cycle have
not identified. detected two kinases 95 115 kda huh-7 total
cell lysates interacted specifically hbv core protein and
phosphorylated arginine-rich c-terminal domain. 95-kda kinase was
purified characterized sr protein-specific kinase 1 (srpk1) mass
spectrometry. based finding, 115-kda kinase could identified as
the related kinase srpk2 immunoblot analysis. vitro, srpks
phosphorylated hbv core protein serine residues found be
phosphorylated vivo. moreover, major cellular hbv core kinase activity
detected total cell lysate showed biochemical properties identical to
those srpk1 srpk2, examined measuring binding panel of
chromatography media. also clearly demonstrate neither the
cyclin-dependent kinases cdc2 cdk2 protein kinase c, previously
implicated hbv core protein phosphorylation, account hbv core
protein kinase activity. conclude srpk1 srpk2 likely
the cellular protein kinases mediating hbv core protein phosphorylation during
viral infection therefore represent important host cell targets for
therapeutic intervention hbv infection.
