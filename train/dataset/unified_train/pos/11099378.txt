oct-4 transcription factor specifically expressed mouse embryonic
stem cells cell lines derived thereof. cells, oct-4 activates
transcription remote binding sites due yet unknown co-activators.
expression oct-4 differentiated cells sufficient activate
transcription distance, rather requires co-expression of
co-activators adenoviral oncoprotein e1a. paper, used
phage display identify oct-4-interacting proteins. first analyzed the
interaction oct-4 e1a order optimize biochemical conditions
that enable oct-4-specific interactions interacting proteins. a
panning approach used enrich oct-4 interacting phages pool of
excess unspecific phages. biochemical conditions established our
interaction assays used screen p19 ec cell cdna expression library
in m13 filamentous phage. number phage clones displaying portions unknown
and known transcription factors obtained, hmg-1 transcription
factor identified. hmg-1, closely related factor hmg-2, interact with
oct-4 co-expressed mammalian cells. addition, hmg-1 found to
cooperate oct-4 p19 ec cells. results provide first evidence of
a non-viral factor enhances oct-4 distance-dependent transactivation stem
cells.
