a major component cellular antiviral system latent protein kinase
pkr, activated binding either double-stranded rna (dsrna) the
cellular pact protein. activated pkr phosphorylates translation initiation
factor eif2, thereby inhibiting viral cellular protein synthesis virus
replication. evade antiviral effects pkr, many viruses, including
influenza virus, evolved multiple mechanisms. influenza virus, the
non-structural (ns1a) protein plays major role blocking activation pkr
during virus infection. mechanism ns1a protein inhibits pkr
activation infected cells established. present study, we
first carried series vitro experiments determine whether ns1a 
protein could utilize common mechanism inhibit pkr activation pact
and dsrna, despite different modes activation. demonstrated 
direct binding ns1a protein n-terminal 230 amino acid region pkr
can serve common mechanism binding require the
rna-binding activity ns1a protein. lack requirement ns1a
rna-binding activity inhibition pkr activation vivo established
by two approaches. first, showed ns1a protein lacking rna-binding
activity, like wild-type (wt) protein, blocked pkr activation pact in
vivo, well downstream effects pkr activation cells, namely, eif2 
phosphorylation apoptosis. addition, demonstrated pkr activation
is inhibited cells infected recombinant influenza virus expressing
ns1a mutant protein cannot bind rna, case cells infected with
wild-type influenza virus.
