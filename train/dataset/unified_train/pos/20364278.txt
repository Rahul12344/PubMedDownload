both fibronectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (asgpr) identified
by investigators partners hepatitis b virus (hbv) envelope proteins. 
because fibronectin natural ligand asgpr, speculated hbv might
attach asgpr expressed hepatocyte surface via fibronectin. test this
hypothesis, first confirmed co-immunoprecipitation asgpr, fibronectin 
and hbsag bind hepg2.2.15 cells, possible binding domains
were identified gst pull-down. addition, measuring binding hbsag to
cells, found asgpr fibronectin enhanced binding capability of
hbsag hepg2 cells, even 293t cho cells, normally bind 
hbv. conclusion, findings suggest fibronectin asgpr mediate 
hbsag binding cell surface, provides evidence the
potential roles two proteins mediating hbv binding liver cells.
