human papillomavirus (hpv) e6 oncoproteins target many cellular proteins for
ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. case p53, mediated 
principally e6ap ubiquitin ligase. several studies reported e6
can target certain substrates apparently e6ap-independent fashion
and several substrates vary degree are
degraded e6 different stages malignancy. fully understand the
regulation e6ap/e6 proteolytic targeting complex, performed mass
spectroscopic analysis hpv type 18 (hpv-18) e6 protein complexes and
identified hect domain-containing ubiquitin ligase edd new hpv-18 e6
binding partner. show edd interact independently e6 and
e6ap. furthermore, edd appears regulate e6ap expression levels independently
of e6, loss edd stimulates proteolytic activity e6/e6ap
complex. conversely, higher levels edd expression protect number of
substrates e6-induced degradation, partly consequence lower levels
of e6 e6ap expression. intriguingly, reduction edd expression levels in
hpv-18-positive hela cells enhances cell resistance apoptotic growth
arrest stimuli. studies suggest changes levels edd
expression different stages viral life cycle malignancy
could profound effect upon ability e6 target various substrates 
for proteolytic degradation thereby directly influence development of
hpv-induced malignancy.
