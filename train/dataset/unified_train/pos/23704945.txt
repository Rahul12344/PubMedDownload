pb1-f2, protein encoded second open reading frame influenza virus
rna segment 2, emerged modulator lung inflammatory responses 
molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood. show
that pb1-f2 inhibits activation nf-κb dependent signalling pathways in
luciferase reporter assays. pb1-f2 proteins four different viruses interact 
with ikkβ yeast two-hybrid assays co-immunoprecipitation. pb1-f2
expression inhibit ikkβ kinase activity nf-κb translocation the
nucleus, nf-κb binding dna severely impaired pb1-f2 transfected
cells assessed electrophoretic mobility shift assay. neither n-terminal
57 amino acid truncated forms c-terminus pb1-f2 able inhibit
nf-κb dependent signalling, indicating full length protein necessary 
for inhibition.
