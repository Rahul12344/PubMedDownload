varicella-zoster virus (vzv) herpes simplex virus (hsv) prevalent
neurotropic herpesviruses cause various nervous system diseases. similar 
other enveloped viruses, membrane fusion essential process viral entry.
therefore, identification host molecules mediate membrane fusion is
important understand mechanism viral infection. here, demonstrate
that myelin-associated glycoprotein (mag), mainly distributed neural tissues, 
associates vzv glycoprotein b (gb) promotes cell-cell fusion when
coexpressed vzv gb gh/gl. vzv preferentially infected mag-transfected
oligodendroglial cells. mag also associated hsv-1 gb enhanced hsv-1
infection promyelocytes. findings suggested mag involved vzv 
and hsv infection neural tissues.
