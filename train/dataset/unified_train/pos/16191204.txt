background: infection jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (jsrv) enzootic nasal
tumor virus (entv) depends cell-surface expression virus entry
receptor, hyaluronidase 2 (hyal2). human hyal2 binds envelope (env) proteins 
of viruses functional receptor, hyal2 mice not
bind env mediate entry either virus. explored the
amino acid determinants account difference receptor function.
results: analysis human-mouse hyal2 chimeric proteins showed amino acid
differences responsible difference hyal2 receptor activity were
localized central third hyal2. human hyal2 mutants containing single or
double amino acid replacements respective mouse amino acids were
generated across region assayed activity. none single or
double mutation reduced receptor activity human hyal2 than
10-fold, whereas mouse hyal2 activity reduced 1,000-fold human
hyal2. 3-dimensional structures mammalian hyal2 proteins are
unknown, bee venom hyaluronidase shows significant amino acid similarity human
and mouse hyal2 structure determined. many mutations 
largest negative effects human hyal2 function mapped small region 
bee venom hyaluronidase close overlapping active site the
enzyme, suggesting site represents binding site env. analysis
of synonymous non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions coding sequences
of multiple mammalian hyal2 proteins shows proteins undergoing
strong selection amino acid conservation. found evidence positive
selection amino acid changes might reflect evolution mammalian hosts
to resist jsrv entv infection.
conclusion: results show greatly reduced receptor activity of
mouse hyal2 comparison human hyal2 determined multiple amino 
acid changes acting concert. particular, one amino acid change blocks
infection. however, important amino acids map small patch a
predicted 3-dimensional hyal2 structure, may represent binding site for
env.
