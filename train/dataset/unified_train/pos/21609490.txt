background: herpes simplex viruses (hsvs) rapidly shut macromolecular
synthesis host cells. contrast, global microarray analyses shown 
hsv infection markedly up-regulates number host cell genes may play
important roles hsv-host cell interactions. understand regulatory
mechanisms involved, initiated studies focusing zinc finger
transcription factor insulinoma-associated 1 (insm1), host cell protein
markedly up-regulated hsv infection.
results: insm1 gene expression hsv-1-infected normal human epidermal
keratinocytes increased least 400-fold 9 h infection; insm1 promoter
activity also markedly stimulated. expression subcellular localization of
the immediate early hsv protein icp0 affected insm1 expression, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assays revealed binding insm1 icp0
promoter. moreover, role insm1 hsv-1 infection clarified by
inhibition hsv-1 replication insm1-specific sirna.
conclusions: results suggest insm1 up-regulation plays positive role
in hsv-1 replication, probably binding icp0 promoter.
