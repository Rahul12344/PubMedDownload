background: tax oncoprotein human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) is
leukemogenic transgenic mice induces permanent t-cell growth vitro. 
is found active cdk holoenzyme complexes adult t-cell leukemia-derived
cultures stimulates g1- to-s phase transition activating the
cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) cdk4. tax protein directly specifically
interacts cdk4 cyclin d2 binding required enhanced cdk4
kinase activity. protein-protein contact tax components of
the cyclin d/cdk complexes increases association cdk4 positive
regulatory subunit cyclin renders complex resistant p21cip
inhibition. tax mutants affecting n-terminus cannot bind cyclin cdk4.
results: analyze, whether n-terminus tax capable cdk4-binding, in
vitro binding -, pull -, mammalian two-hybrid analyses performed.
these experiments revealed segment 40 amino acids sufficient to
interact cdk4 cyclin d2. define tax-binding domain analyze 
tax influences kinase activity, series cdk4 deletion mutants tested.
different assays revealed two regions upon deletion consistently result 
reduced binding activity. isolated subjected mammalian
two-hybrid analysis test potential interact tax n-terminus. 
these experiments concurrently revealed binding n- c-terminus cdk4.
the n-terminal segment contains pstaire helix, known control 
access substrate active cleft cdk4 thus kinase activity.
conclusion: since n- c-terminus cdk4 neighboring predicted 
three-dimensional protein structure, conceivable comprise a
single binding domain, interacts tax n-terminus.
