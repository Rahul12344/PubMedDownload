the e6 oncoprotein bovine papillomavirus type 1 (bpv-1) shown to
transform cells p53-independent pathway, transforming mechanism
is unknown. demonstrate vitro vivo interactions bpv-1
e6 focal adhesion protein paxillin. ability bpv-1 e6 complex
with paxillin correlated ability transform; e6 mutant proteins
impaired transformation function also impaired abilities
to bind paxillin. e6 binding paxillin also may contribute carcinogenic 
potential human papillomavirus (hpv); able show vitro
binding paxillin e6 proteins cancer-associated type hpv 16 but
not nononcogenic types 6 11. association e6 paxillin was
affected depolymerization actin fiber network, overexpression of
bpv-1 e6 led disruption actin fiber formation. disruption actin
cytoskeleton characteristic many transformed cells, and, bpv-1
transformed cells, may mediated bpv-1 e6 interaction with
paxillin.
