potent anti-retroviral therapy transformed hiv-1 infection chronic
manageable disease; however, drug resistance remains common problem limits
the effectiveness clinical benefits type treatment. discovery 
of viral reservoirs body, hiv-1 may persist, helped to
explain therapeutic eradication hiv-1 proved difficult. the
current study, utilized combination structure-based analysis of
cyclin/cdk complexes previously published tat peptide derivatives. we
modeled tat peptide inhibitors cdks found particular pocket that
showed stable binding site (cavity 1) using silico analysis.
furthermore, able find peptide mimetics bound similar regions 
using silico searches chemical library, followed cell-based biological
assays. using methods, obtained first-generation mimetic drugs and
tested compounds hiv-1 long terminal repeat-activated transcription.
using biological assays followed similar silico analysis find
second-generation drugs resembling original mimetic, found new targets
of cavity 1 cavity 2 regions cdk9. examined second-generation
mimetic various viral isolates observed generalized suppression 
most hiv-1 isolates. finally, drug inhibited viral replication humanized
mouse models rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) toxicity animals tested
concentrations. results suggest may possible model peptide
inhibitors available crystal structures find drug mimetics using
in silico analysis.
