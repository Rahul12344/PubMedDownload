rna helicase (rha) belongs deah family proteins capable of
unwinding double-stranded rna structure. addition involvement the
metabolism cellular rna, rha shown stimulate rna transcription
from long terminal repeat promoter human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(hiv-1) well enhance rev/rev response element-mediated gene expression. 
in study, provide evidence rha associates hiv-1 gag an
rna-dependent manner. interaction results specific incorporation rha
into hiv-1 particles. knockdown endogenous rha virus producer cells leads
to generation hiv-1 particles less infectious part result 
restricted reverse transcription. therefore, rha represents first example 
cellular rna helicases participate hiv-1 particle production promote 
viral reverse transcription.
