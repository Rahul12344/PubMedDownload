in addition human papillomavirus (hpv)-induced immortalization of
epithelial cells, usually requires integration viral dna the
host cell genome, steroid hormone-activated nuclear receptors (nrs) thought
to bind specific dna sequences within transcriptional regulatory regions on
the long control region either increase suppress transcription dependent
genes. study, data suggest nr coactivator function hpv e2
proteins might mediated physical functional interactions 
only nrs also nr coactivators grip1 (glucocorticoid receptor-interacting 
protein 1) zac1 (zinc-finger protein regulates apoptosis cell cycle
arrest 1), reciprocally regulating transactivation activities. grip1 and
zac1 able act synergistically hpv e2 proteins e2-,
androgen receptor-, estrogen receptor-dependent transcriptional activation
systems. grip1 zac1 might selectively function hpv e2 proteins on
thyroid receptor- p53-dependent transcriptional activation, respectively.
hence, transcriptional function e2 might mediated nrs nr
coactivators regulate e2-, nr-, p53-dependent transcriptional activations.
