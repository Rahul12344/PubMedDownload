transcription late genes simian virus 40 (sv40) repressed the
early phase lytic cycle infection binding cellular factors,
called ibp-s, sv40 late promoter; repression relieved onset
of viral dna replication titration repressors. preliminary data
indicated one major components ibp-s human estrogen-related
receptor 1 (herr1). show several members steroid/thyroid
hormone receptor superfamily, including testis receptor 2, thyroid receptor alpha
1 combination retinoid x receptor alpha, chicken ovalbumin upstream
promoter transcription factors 1 2 (coup-tf1 coup-tf2), well herr1,
possess properties ibp-s. receptors bind specifically hormone
receptor binding sites present sv40 major late promoter. recombinant
coup-tf1 specifically represses transcription sv40 major late promoter
in cell-free transcription system. expression coup-tf1, coup-tf2, herr1
in monkey cells results repression sv40 late promoter, the
early promoter, absence virally encoded large tumor antigen.
overexpression coup-tf1 leads delay early-to-late switch sv40
gene expression lytic cycle infection. thus, members this
superfamily play major direct roles regulating expression sv40.
possibly, natural synthetic ligands receptors serve antiviral 
drugs. findings also provide basis development assays to
screen ligands testis receptor 2 herr1.
