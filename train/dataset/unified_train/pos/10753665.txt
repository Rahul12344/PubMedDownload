nef protein hiv/siv lentiviruses affects g-protein-mediated signaling, and
physically associates lck, myristoylated palmitoylated src-like tyrosine
kinase. assess whether nef interacts alpha-subunits heterotrimeric g
proteins (galpha), carrying lipidation motif lck, transiently
expressed nef g(o)alpha (wild-type nonpalmitoylated c3s mutant),
individually combination, transfected cos-7 cells. recombinant nef was
mostly recovered particulate fractions, nef-green fluorescent protein
chimera localized plasmalemma vivo fluorescence imaging.
moreover, nef c3s entirely solubilized cold triton x-100, and
excluded low buoyant density sucrose gradient fractions, containing
caveolin-1, whereas wild-type g(o)alpha partially resistant triton
extraction, colocalized caveolin-1. coexpression, nef recruited
soluble c3s membranes, two proteins coimmunoprecipitated by
g(o)alpha nef antisera. conclude nef interacts nonpalmitoylated 
g(o)alpha, presumably outside caveolin-rich microdomains plasma membrane.
