aim: hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection highly correlated hepatocellular
carcinoma. previous studies reported expression hepatitis b virus
pre-s2 mutant surface antigen related hepatoma development. aberrant
carbohydrate metabolism hallmark malignant transformation.
methods: performed yeast two-hybrid screening hbv pre-s2-del large
surface protein (pre-s2delta) using human liver cdna library, identified
the acid alpha-glucosidase (acid alpha-glucosidase) novel cellular
interacting protein pre-s2delta. association pre-s2delta acid 
alpha-glucosidase confirmed confocal immunofluorescence and
co-immunoprecipitation assay. further, acid alpha-glucosidase activity and
glycogen content analyzed ml-1 cells expressing pre-s2delta.
results: interaction hbv large surface protein acid
alpha-glucosidase demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation vitro in
vivo, binding mediated c-terminal region 889-952 amino acid
of acid alpha-glucosidase. hand, hbv large surface protein
interacted acid alpha-glucosidase n-terminal region 1-157 amino acid
of hbv large surface protein. expression hbv large surface protein enhanced
acid alpha-glucosidase activity resulted decrease cellular glycogen.
conclusion: result demonstrates hbv large surface protein interacts with
acid alpha-glucosidase plays important role glycogen balance.
together, data suggest novel pathway hbv large surface protein
affects carbohydrate metabolism.
