we recently shown icp4 differential requirement general
transcription factor tfiia vitro (s. zabierowski n. deluca, j. virol.
78:6162-6170, 2004). tfiia dispensable icp4 activation late promoter
(gc) required efficient activation early promoter (tk). 
intact inr element required proficient icp4 activation late
promoter absence tfiia. tfiia known stabilize binding
of tata binding protein (tbp) tfiid tata box core promoters
and icp4 shown interact tfiid, tested ability icp4 
stabilize binding either tbp tfiid tata box representative
early, late, inr-mutated late promoters (tk, gc, gc8, respectively).
utilizing dnase footprinting analysis, found icp4 able to
facilitate tfiia stabilized binding tbp tata box early tk
promoter. using mutant icp4 proteins, ability stabilize binding tbp
to wild-type inr-mutated gc promoters located the
amino-terminal region icp4. tfiid substituted tbp, icp4 could
stabilize binding tfiid tata box wild-type gc promoter.
icp4, however, could effectively stabilize tfiid binding tata box of
the inr-mutated late promoter. additional activities tfiia required
to stabilize binding tfiid inr-mutated late promoter. collectively,
these data suggest tfiia may dispensable icp4 activation the
wild-type late promoter icp4 substitute tfiia's ability to
stabilize binding tfiid tata box. absence functional
inr, icp4 longer stabilize tfiid binding tata box late
promoter requires additional activities tfiia. stabilized binding 
of tfiid tfiia may turn allow icp4 efficiently activate
transcription non-inr containing promoters.
