province, china.

background: pres1 domain large envelope protein identified as
an essential viral structure involved hepatitis b virus (hbv) attachment.
however, cellular receptor(s) hbv yet identified.
aims: identify cell-surface receptor hbv, could elucidate the
molecular mechanism hbv infection.
methods: novel yeast two-hybrid system used screen proteins interacting 
with pres1 region hbv. interaction verified yeast
cotransformation, coimmunoprecipitation mammalian two-hybrid assay, while
their intracellular tissue localization analyzed confocal microscopy
and immunohistochemistry, respectively.
results: asialoglycoprotein receptor (asgpr) interacted specifically directly
with pres1 domain hbv vivo vitro. levels expression of
pres1 asgpr liver similar correlated other.
conclusions: asgpr candidate receptor hbv mediates steps of
hbv entry.
