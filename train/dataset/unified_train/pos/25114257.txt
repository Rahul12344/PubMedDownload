middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov) currently spreads in
humans causes âˆ¼ 36% fatality infected patients. believed have
originated bats, mers-cov genetically related bat coronaviruses hku4
and hku5. understand bat coronaviruses transmit humans, investigated
the receptor usage cell entry activity virus-surface spike proteins of
hku4 hku5. found dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (dpp4), receptor for
mers-cov, also receptor hku4, hku5. despite sharing common
receptor, mers-cov hku4 spikes demonstrated functional differences. first,
whereas mers-cov prefers human dpp4 bat dpp4 receptor, hku4 shows the
opposite trend. second, absence exogenous proteases, mers-cov 
hku4 spikes mediate pseudovirus entry bat cells, whereas mers-cov
spike, hku4 spike, mediates pseudovirus entry human cells. thus,
mers-cov, hku4, adapted use human dpp4 human cellular
proteases efficient human cell entry, contributing enhanced
pathogenesis mers-cov humans. results establish dpp4 functional 
receptor hku4 host cellular proteases host range determinant for
hku4. also suggest dpp4-recognizing bat coronaviruses threaten human
health spikes' capability adapt human cells for
cross-species transmissions.
