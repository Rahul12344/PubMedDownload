background: hepatitis b virus x protein key regulator of
hepatocarcinogenesis. pregnane x receptor xenobiotic nuclear receptor
that plays role regulation drug-metabolizing enzymes including the
cytochrome p450 3a4, enzyme important bioactivation liver
carcinogen aflatoxin b1.
aims: identify novel host factor interacts hepatitis b virus x
protein functional interaction hepatitis b virus x protein and
pregnane x receptor hepatocarcinogenesis.
methods: co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione s-transferase pull-down, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation utilized assess interaction between
hepatitis b virus x protein pregnane x receptor. functional relevance 
hepatitis b virus x protein-pregnane x receptor interaction investigated in
cell cultures hepatocellular carcinoma samples.
results: observed hepatitis b virus x protein pregnane x receptor
co-localize hepatic cells. pregnane x receptor interacted hepatitis b
virus x protein via ligand-binding domain pregnane x receptor.
functionally, hepatitis b virus x protein increased transcriptional activity 
of pregnane x receptor. pregnane x receptor able recruit hepatitis b virus
x protein cyp3a4 gene promoter. clinic samples, expression of
pregnane x receptor high hepatitis b virus-associated liver cirrhosis 
stage hepatocellular carcinoma, low state ii stage iii
hepatocellular carcinoma.
conclusion: revealed novel function hepatitis b virus x protein in
co-activating pregnane x receptor. increased expression pregnane x
receptor target gene cyp3a4 potential biomarkers early stage 
of hepatitis b virus-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.
