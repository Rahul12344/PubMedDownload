as infectious agent causing human adult t-cell leukemia (atl), human
t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) virus spreads vivo primarily by
cell-to-cell transmission. however, factors determine transmission
efficiency fully understood. viral genome encodes htlv-1 bzip
factor (hbz), expressed atl cases known promote t-cell 
proliferation. study, investigated hypothesis hbz also
influences survival cells. analyzing transcriptional profile
of hbz-expressing cells, learned hbz suppressed transcription the
proapoptotic gene bim (bcl2l11) hbz-expressing cells resistant to
activation-induced apoptosis. mechanistic investigations hbz suppresses 
bim expression revealed hbz perturbs localization function of
foxo3a, critical transcriptional activator genes encoding bim also
fas ligand (fasl). interacting foxo3a, hbz attenuated dna
binding foxo3a also sequestered inactive form foxo3a the
nucleus. similar manner, hbz also inhibited fasl transcription induced by
t-cell activation. study atl cells identified bim perturbations 
by hbz, including level epigenetic alteration, histone modification 
the promoter region bim gene. collectively, results indicated hbz
impairs transcription bim fasl genes disrupting foxo3a function,
broadening understanding hbz acts promote proliferation of
htlv-1-infected cells blocking apoptosis.
