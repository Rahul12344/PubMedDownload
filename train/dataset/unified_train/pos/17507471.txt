adeno-associated virus type 5 (aav5) unique among human aav serotypes 
it uses polyadenylation site [(pa)p] within single small intron the
center genome. previously reported inhibition polyadenylation
at (pa)p, necessary read-through p41-generated capsid gene pre-mrnas which
are subsequently spliced, requires binding u1 snrnp upstream donor.
inhibition reduced distance cap site donor was
increased (increasing size 5' exon). here, demonstrated that
u1-70k key component u1 snrnp mediates inhibition polyadenylation
at (pa)p. furthermore, introduction u-rich stretch, predicted target
tia-1 thus increase affinity u1 snrnp binding intervening donor
site, significantly augmented inhibition (pa)p, depletion tia-1 by
sirna increased (pa)p read-through. finally, artificially tethering cap
binding complex (cbc) components cbp80 cbp20 upstream intron donor
increased inhibition polyadenylation (pa)p. results suggest that
interaction cbc strengthens u1 snrnp binding downstream intron
donor manner inversely proportional size 5' exon, thus
governing competition intron splicing polyadenylation (pa)p.
this competition must optimized program levels polyadenylation 
of p7- p19-generated rna (pa)p required produce proper levels the
essential rep proteins splicing p41-generated rnas produce the
proper ratio capsid proteins aav5 infection.
