hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection often causes long-term persistent hepatitis,
which eventually leads liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma.
hcv-encoded ns3/4a protease plays important role hcv immune evasion by
cleaving key adapter proteins visa trif rig-i-like receptors and
toll-like receptors mediated interferon (ifn) induction pathways. further
understand roles ns3/4a hcv life cycle, identified ddb1 a
cellular substrate ns3/4a protease biochemical purification mass
spectrometry analysis. ns3/4a interacted ddb1 cleaved ddb1 in
hcv-infected cells. mutagenesis indicated ns3/4a cleaved ddb1 residue
of c378. overexpression ddb1 potentiated hcv replication, whereas knockdown of
ddb1 dramatically inhibited hcv replication. furthermore, data indicated that
the cleavage ddb1 ns3/4a protease required hcv replication. our
findings suggest ddb1 cellular substrate ns3/4a required hcv
replication provide new insight interaction hcv host
cells.
