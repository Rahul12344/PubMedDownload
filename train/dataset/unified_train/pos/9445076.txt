the matrix (ma) protein human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) plays a
critical role virion morphogenesis fulfills important functions the
early steps infection. effort identify cellular partners ma, a
saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid screen utilized. specific interaction
between ho3, putative histidyl-trna synthetase, demonstrated this
system. ho3-specific mrna detected several tissues relevant hiv
infection, spleen, thymus, peripheral blood lymphocytes, well as
in number t-lymphoid-cell lines. binding ho3 confirmed in
transfected cells coimmunoprecipitation. interaction abrogated by
replacing two lysine residues positions 26 27 threonine
(ma(kk27tt)). ho3 localized cytoplasm nucleus acutely
transfected 293t cells. overexpressed hiv-1-producing cells, ho3 was
incorporated wild-type virions ones containing the
dilysine-mutated variant ma. correspondingly, overexpression ho3 virus
producer cells enhanced infectivity wild-type ma(kk27aa) hiv-1
particles. stimulating effect ho3 independent presence of
envelope, vpr, vpu. taken together, results suggest ho3, through
its recognition ma, plays role life cycle hiv-1.
