fcgamma receptor (fcgammar)-mediated entry infectious dengue virus immune
complexes monocytes/macrophages hypothesized key event the
pathogenesis complicated dengue fever. fcgammaria (cd64) fcgammariia
(cd32), predominate surface dengue virus-permissive cells,
were compared influence infectivity dengue 2 virus immune
complexes formed human dengue virus antibodies. signaling immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif (itam) incorporated accessory
gamma-chain subunit associates fcgammaria constitutively in
fcgammariia required phagocytosis mediated receptors. to
determine whether fcgammaria fcgammariia activation functions also
required internalization infectious dengue virus immune complexes, we
generated native signaling-incompetent versions receptor by
site-directed mutagenesis itam tyrosine residues. plasmids designed express
these receptors transfected cos-7 cells, dengue virus replication
was measured plaque assay flow cytometry. found receptors
mediated enhanced dengue virus immune complex infectivity fcgammariia
appeared far effectively. abrogation fcgammaria signaling
competency, either expression without gamma-chain coexpression with
gamma-chain mutants, associated significant impairment phagocytosis
and dengue virus immune complex infectivity. abrogation fcgammariia
signaling competency also associated equally impaired phagocytosis but
had discernible effect dengue virus immune complex infectivity. these
findings point fundamental differences fcgammaria fcgammariia with
respect immune-enhancing capabilities suggest different
mechanisms dengue virus immune complex internalization may operate between
these fcgammars.
