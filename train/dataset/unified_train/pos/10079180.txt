epithelin/granulin growth factor synthesized 593 amino acid precursor
protein contains 7.5 imperfectly conserved repeats approximately 57 amino
acids. processed epithelin/granulin peptides isolated from
vertebrate/invertebrate species growth factors implicated epithelial
and haemic cell function. identified human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv) tat binding proteins using yeast two-hybrid assay.
intracellularly yeast, mutation selected cysteines epithelin/granulin
dimeric repeat caused loss binding tat exon 1. vitro binding hiv-1
and hiv-2 tat epithelin/granulin dimeric monomeric repeats also
observed gst-glutathione bead "pulldown" assays. tat actively
secreted hiv-infected cells shown serve mitogenic
factor angiogenesis kaposi-like cells, observations suggest 
epithelin/granulin growth factors may function biologically important
extracellular tat co-factors.
