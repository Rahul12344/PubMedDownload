human t-cell leukemia virus type-1 (htlv-1) infection causes adult t-cell
leukemia (atl). modulation transcriptional control cellular genes by
htlv-1 thought associated development atl. viral protein
htlv-1 basic leucine-zipper factor (hbz) shown dysregulate the
activity cellular transcription factors. here, demonstrate hbz is
exported nucleus cytoplasm, activates mammalian
target rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway association growth
arrest dna damage gene 34 (gadd34). n-terminal region hbz interacts
with c-terminal region gadd34. hbz contains functional nuclear export
signal (nes) sequence within n-terminal region exported the
nucleus via crm1-dependent pathway. nuclear export hbz essential for
its interaction gadd34 increased phosphorylation s6 kinase, 
an established downstream target mtor pathway. starvation-induced
autophagy significantly suppressed overexpression hbz. these
findings indicate hbz actively exported cytoplasm, it
dysregulates function cellular factors.
