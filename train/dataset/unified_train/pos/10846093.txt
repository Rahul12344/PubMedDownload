we characterized human herpesvirus 6b (hhv-6b) rep gene, a
homologue adeno-associated virus type 2 rep unique the
herpesvirus family. three transcripts, 9.0, 5.0, 2. 7 kb (the major
transcript), detected northern blotting using hhv-6b rep probe under
late conditions. investigated expression kinetics rep gene using
cycloheximide (chx) phosphonoformic acid (pfa), inhibitors of
protein synthesis viral dna synthesis, respectively. 5.2-kb transcript
was mainly detected absence protein biosynthesis upon infection, and
none 9.0-, 5.0-, 2.7-kb transcripts detected late conditions
were detected presence chx pfa. sequences obtained cdna
library showed 5.0- 2.7-kb transcripts spliced two and
three exons, respectively, 2.7-kb transcript abundant.
immunohistochemistry using antibody raised hhv-6 rep gene product 
(rep) revealed rep mainly present nucleus mt-4 cells within 24
h infection hhv-6b. using pull-down assays, coimmunoprecipitation, and
a mammalian two hybrid system, showed hhv-6 rep binds transcription 
factor, human tata-binding protein, n-terminal region.
