it well-established hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection associated 
the development hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), patients high viral
dna load significantly higher risk. host factors required for
efficient viral replication may, therefore, contribute high viral dna
load, screened host factors transcriptionally activate hbv
core promoter (hbvcp). report poly (adp-ribose) polymerase 1
(parp1), known dna repair activity, binds prominently an
octamer motif hbvcp increases transcriptional efficiency. utilizing
a series single base substitutions nucleotide position octamer,
the parp1 binding motif defined "rnnwcaaa." intriguingly, introduction 
of vector construct bearing tandem repeats octamer motif able to
impair dna repair function parp1. finding suggests hbv viral dna
contains specific sequence motifs may play role disrupting dna
repair pathways infected hepatocytes.conclusion: study identified a
novel octamer motif hbvcp binds parp1, interaction increases
the replication efficiency hbv. presence octamer motif in
hepatocytes shown inhibit dna repair capacity parp1, potentially
contributing development hcc.
