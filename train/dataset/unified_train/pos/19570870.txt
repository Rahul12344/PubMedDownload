hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna genome replicates within ribonucleoprotein (rnp) 
complex modified membranous structures extended endoplasmic
reticulum. proteomic analysis hcv rnp complexes revealed association 
oxysterol binding protein (osbp) one components complexes.
osbp interacted n-terminal domain hcv ns5a protein and
colocalized golgi compartment ns5a. osbp-specific short hairpin
rna partially downregulated osbp expression resulted decrease the
hcv particle release culture supernatant little effect viral rna
replication. pleckstrin homology (ph) domain located n-terminal region
of osbp targeted protein golgi apparatus. osbp deletion mutation in
the ph (deltaph) domain failed localize golgi apparatus inhibited
the hcv particle release. studies suggest possible functional role of
osbp hcv maturation process.
