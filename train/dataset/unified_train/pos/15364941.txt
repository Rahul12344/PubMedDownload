the hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5b protein viral rna-dependent rna
polymerase required replication hcv rna genome. identified a
peptide closely resembles short region protein kinase
c-related kinase 2 (prk2) screening random 12-mer peptide library
displayed surface m13 bacteriophage ns5b proteins immobilized 
on microwell plates. competitive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay a
synthetic peptide showed phage clone displaying peptide could bind 
hcv rna polymerase high affinity. coimmunoprecipitation colocalization
studies demonstrated vivo interaction ns5b prk2. vitro kinase
assays demonstrated prk2 specifically phosphorylates ns5b interaction
with n-terminal finger domain ns5b (amino acids 1-187). consistent with
the vitro ns5b-phosphorylating activity prk2, detected the
phosphorylated form ns5b metabolic cell labeling. furthermore, hcv ns5b
immunoprecipitated hcv subgenomic replicon cells specifically recognized
by antiphosphoserine antibody. knock-down endogenous prk2 expression
using prk2-specific small interfering rna inhibited hcv rna replication. in
contrast, prk2 overexpression, accompanied increase the
level active form, dramatically enhanced hcv rna replication. altogether, 
our results indicate hcv rna replication regulated ns5b
phosphorylation prk2.
