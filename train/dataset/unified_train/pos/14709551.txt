hepatitis c virus (hcv) establishes persistent infection, 80% of
infected individuals proceeding chronic hepatitis, many cases may
result liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc); indeed hcv
infection increasingly associated development hcc. long time
period (up 30 years) primary infection onset hcc implies
that hcv directly oncogenic way predisposes patients to
develop tumors, though mechanism unclear yet. report here
that ns5a binds directly src homology 3 domain p85 regulatory
subunit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k), interaction mediated 
a novel (non-proline-rich) motif within ns5a. coimmunoprecipitation analysis
revealed ns5a bound native heterodimeric pi3k enhanced the
phosphotransferase activity catalytic (p110) subunit vitro 
human cell lines harboring subgenomic hcv replicon expressing ns5a alone.
ns5a-mediated activation pi3k resulted increased phosphorylation and
activity akt/protein kinase b concomitantly provided protection against
the induction apoptosis replicon-harboring cells cells stably
expressing ns5a alone. data suggest stimulation pi3k ns5a may
represent indirect mechanism development hcc hcv-infected patients
and suggests potential therapeutic strategies counteract the
occurrence hcv-related hcc.
