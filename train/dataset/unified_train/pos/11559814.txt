poliovirus (pv) replicates genome association membranous vesicles 
the cytoplasm infected cells. elucidate origin mode formation of
pv vesicles, immunofluorescence labeling antibodies viral
vesicle marker proteins 2b 2bc, well cellular markers the
endoplasmic reticulum (er), anterograde transport vesicles, golgi
complex, performed bt7-h cells. optical sections obtained confocal
laser scanning microscopy subjected deconvolution process enhance
resolution signal-to-noise ratio allow three-dimensional
representation labeled membrane structures. mode formation pv
vesicles was, morphological grounds, similar formation anterograde
membrane traffic vesicles uninfected cells. er-resident membrane markers 
excluded types vesicles, copii components sec13 sec31
were found colocalized vesicular surface, indicating the
presence functional copii coat. pv vesicle formation early time
points infection involve golgi complex. expression pv
protein 2bc entire p2 p3 genomic region led production of
vesicles carrying copii coat showing mode formation vesicles
produced pv infection. results indicate pv vesicles formed
at er cellular copii budding mechanism thus homologous 
vesicles anterograde membrane transport pathway.
