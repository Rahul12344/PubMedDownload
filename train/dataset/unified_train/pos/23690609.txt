hepatitis c virus (hcv) major cause chronic liver disease, an
estimated 170 million people infected worldwide. low yields, poor stability, 
inefficient binding conventional em grids posed significant challenges to
the purification structural analysis hcv. report, generated 
infectious hcv genome affinity tag fused e2 envelope glycoprotein.
using affinity grids, previously described isolate proteins macromolecular
complexes single-particle em, able purify enveloped particles
directly cell culture media. approach allowed rapid situ
purification virions increased particle density instrumental for
cryo-em cryoelectron tomography (cryo-et). moreover, enabled
ultrastructural analysis virions produced primary human hepatocytes. hcv
appears structurally irregular member flaviviridae family. 
particles spherical, spike-like projections, heterogeneous size
ranging 40 100 nm diameter. exosomes, although isolated from
unfractionated culture media, absent highly infectious, purified virus
preparations. cryo-et studies provided low-resolution 3d structural information
of highly infectious virions. addition apolipoprotein (apo)e, hcv particles
also incorporate apob apoa-i. general, host apolipoproteins more
readily accessible antibody labeling hcv glycoproteins, suggesting either
lower abundance masking host proteins.
