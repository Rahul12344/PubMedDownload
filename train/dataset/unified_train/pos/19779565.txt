identification novel cellular proteins substrates viral proteases would

proteins, cstf-64, critical factor 3' pre-mrna processing a
cell nucleus, selected study. time-course study monitor 
expression levels cstf-64 ev71-infected cells also revealed the
reduction cstf-64 virus infection correlated production of
viral 3c(pro). cstf-64 cleaved vitro 3c(pro) neither mutant
3c(pro) (in catalytic site inactivated) another ev71
protease 2a(pro). serial mutagenesis performed cstf-64, revealing the
3c(pro) cleavage sites located position 251 n-terminal p/g-rich
domain multiple positions close c-terminus cstf-64 (around
position 500). accumulation unprocessed pre-mrna depression of
mature mrna observed ev71-infected cells. vitro assay revealed 
inhibition 3'-end pre-mrna processing polyadenylation in
3c(pro)-treated nuclear extract, impairment rescued adding
purified recombinant cstf-64 protein. summing results, suggest
that 3c(pro) cleavage inactivates cstf-64 impairs host cell
polyadenylation vitro, well virus-infected cells. finding is, to
our knowledge, first demonstrate picornavirus protein affects the
polyadenylation host mrna.
