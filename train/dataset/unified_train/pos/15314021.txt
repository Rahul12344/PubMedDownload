the chicken anemia virus protein apoptin induces apoptosis absence p53 
by mechanism remains elucidated. show transformed
cells, apoptin associated apc1, subunit anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (apc/c). demonstrate apoptin expression, depletion
of apc1 rna interference, inhibits apc/c function p53 null cells, resulting
in g2/m arrest apoptosis. results explain ability apoptin to
induce apoptosis absence p53 suggest apc/c an
attractive target anticancer drug development.
