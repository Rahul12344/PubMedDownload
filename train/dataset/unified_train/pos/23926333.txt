we shown circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses responsible for
poliomyelitis outbreaks madagascar recombinant genomes composed of
sequences encoding capsid proteins derived poliovaccine sabin, mostly type 2
(pvs2), sequences encoding nonstructural proteins derived human
enteroviruses. interestingly, almost recombinant genomes encode a
nonstructural 3a protein related field coxsackievirus a17 (cv-a17)
strains. here, investigated repercussions exchange, assessing
the role 3a proteins pvs2 cv-a17 putative cellular
partners viral replication. found golgi protein acyl-coenzyme a
binding domain-containing 3 (acbd3), recently identified interactor the
3a proteins several picornaviruses, interacts 3a proteins pvs2 and
cv-a17 viral rna replication sites, human neuroblastoma cells infected with
either pvs2 pvs2 recombinant encoding 3a protein cv-a17
[pvs2-3a(cv-a17)]. small interfering rna-mediated downregulation acbd3
significantly increased growth viruses, suggesting acbd3 slowed 
viral replication. confirmed replicons. furthermore,
pvs2-3a(cv-a17) resistant replication-inhibiting effect acbd3

modulating sensitivity viral replication acbd3. overall, results
indicate exchanges nonstructural proteins modify relationships
between enterovirus recombinants cellular interactors may thus one 
the factors favoring emergence.
