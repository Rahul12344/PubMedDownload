alphaviruses arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) include number of
important human animal pathogens. replication proceeds cytoplasm
of infected cells directly depend nuclei. alphaviruses encode
only four nonstructural proteins required replication viral
genome transcription subgenomic rna. however, replicative enzyme
complexes (rcs) appear include cellular proteins assemble cellular
organelles. developed set recombinant sindbis (sin) viruses with
green fluorescent protein (gfp) insertions one nonstructural proteins, 
nsp3, understand rcs' genesis structure. studied the
assembly nsp3/gfp-containing protein complexes different stages of
infection isolated combination cellular proteins associated
with sin nsp3. demonstrated following. (i) sin nsp3 tolerate the
insertion gfp different fragments coding sequence; designed
recombinant viruses viable, replication leads assembly of
nsp3/gfp chimeric proteins gradually developing, higher-order structures
differently organized early late times postinfection. (ii) late times
postinfection, nsp3 assembled complexes similar sizes, appear to
be bound cytoskeleton filaments aggregate larger structures.
(iii) protein complexes associated nsp3/gfp contain high
concentration cytoskeleton proteins, chaperones, elongation factor 1a,
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, 14-3-3 proteins, the
ribosomal proteins. proteins proposed essential sin rc
formation and/or functioning.
