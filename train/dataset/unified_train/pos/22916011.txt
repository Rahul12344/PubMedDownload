novel therapies urgently needed hepatitis c virus infection (hcv), 
major global health problem. current model infectious virus production
suggests hcv virions assembled near surface lipid droplets,
acquire envelope er, egress secretory pathway. the
mechanisms hcv assembly particularly role viral-host
protein-protein interactions mediating process are, however, poorly
understood. identified conserved heretofore unrecognized yxxφ motif (φ 
bulky hydrophobic residue) within core protein. motif homologous to
sorting signals within host cargo proteins known mediate binding ap2m1, the
μ subunit clathrin adaptor protein complex 2 (ap-2), intracellular
trafficking. using microfluidics affinity analysis, protein-fragment
complementation assays, co-immunoprecipitations infected cells, show
that motif mediates core binding ap2m1. yxxφ mutations, silencing ap2m1
expression overexpressing dominant negative ap2m1 mutant effect on
hcv rna replication, however, dramatically inhibited intra- and
extracellular infectivity, consistent defect viral assembly.
quantitative confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed core's yxxφ motif
mediates recruitment ap2m1 lipid droplets observed defect in
hcv assembly following disruption core-ap2m1 binding correlates with
accumulation core lipid droplets, reduced core colocalization e2 and
reduced core localization trans-golgi network (tgn), presumed site of
viral particles maturation. furthermore, aak1 gak, serine/threonine kinases
known stimulate binding ap2m1 host cargo proteins, regulate core-ap2m1
binding essential hcv assembly. last, approved anti-cancer drugs that
inhibit aak1 gak disrupt core-ap2m1 binding, also significantly
inhibit hcv assembly infectious virus production. results validate
viral-host interactions essential hcv assembly yield compounds for
pharmaceutical development.
