tax, protein encoded env-px gene human t-cell leukemia virus type i
(htlv-i), interacts various host cell transcription factors. tax activates
transcription long terminal repeat (ltr) htlv-i association
with cyclic amp-responsive element-binding protein (creb). here, present
evidence transducer regulated cyclic amp-response element-binding protein
3 (torc3), co-activator creb, involved tax-induced transcriptional
activation htlv-i ltr. using luciferase assay system, show 
torc3 alone enhance transcription htlv-i ltr, well a
cellular cyclic amp-response element (cre). interestingly, find that
co-expression torc3 tax dramatically increased transcriptional activation 
at htlv-i ltr. also show glutathione s-transferase pull-down and
co-immunoprecipitation experiments torc3 interacts tax. using deletion 
mutant analysis, identify tax interaction domain torc3 region
spanning amino acid 1 103, contains coiled-coil domain. these
results provide important clues toward understanding molecular mechanism of
tax-dependent transcriptional activation htlv-i ltr.
