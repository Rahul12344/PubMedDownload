the human tr2 orphan receptor (tr2), initially isolated testis prostate 
cdna libraries, member steroid receptor superfamily. tr2 regulate
several target genes via binding consensus response element (aggtca) in
direct repeat orientation (aggtcax((n))aggtca, n = 0-6). show tr2 is
able induce expression human papilloma virus type 16 (hpv-16) genes via
binding dr4 response element long control region hpv-16.
additionally, one hpv-16 gene products, e6 oncogene, regulates tr2
gene expression. likely mechanism regulation involves e6-mediated
degradation tumor suppressor p53, protein known suppress tr2
expression. together data provide evidence feedback regulation between
tr2 hpv-16, represents novel regulatory pathway involving member of
the steroid receptor superfamily hpv-16 dna tumor virus.
