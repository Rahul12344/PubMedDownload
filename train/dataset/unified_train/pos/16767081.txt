emerging evidence suggests supernumerary centrosomes drive genome
instability oncogenesis. human t-cell leukaemia virus type (htlv-i) is
etiologically associated adult t-cell leukaemia (atl). atl cells are
aneuploid, causes aneuploidy incompletely understood. here, we
show centrosome amplification frequent htlv-i-transformed cells and
that phenotype caused viral tax oncoprotein. also show the
fraction tax protein localizes centrosomes interacts tax1bp2, a
novel centrosomal protein composed almost entirely coiled-coil domains.
overexpression tax1bp2 inhibited centrosome duplication, whereas depletion 
tax1bp2 rnai resulted centrosome hyperamplification. findings suggest
that htlv-i tax oncoprotein targets tax1bp2 causing genomic instability and
aneuploidy.
