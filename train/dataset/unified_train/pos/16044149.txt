protein kinase b (pkb) akt one several second messenger kinases are
activated cell attachment growth factor signaling, transmit
signals cell nucleus inhibit apoptosis thereby increase cell
survival proliferation. viral proteins target pathway by
increasing pkb/akt phosphorylation, pathway implicated the
transformation human keratinocytes hpv e6 e7, together activated
notch 1. here, examine hpv e7 expression affects phosphorylation of
pkb. show hpv-16 e7 increases level phosphorylation pkb in
response serum stimulation, mechanism independent downregulation of
pten phosphatase, known inhibitor pi3k (pi3 kinase) pathway. use 
specific antibodies shows proportion pkb/akt phosphorylated 
both threonine 308 serine 473 maintained presence e7 pi3
kinase-independent manner, activated phosphorylation bad, known
downstream target pkb/akt. use e7 mutants ruled inhibition 
of igfbp-3, known e7 target pkb/akt modulator, interaction e7
with cellular pocket proteins, mechanism pkb/akt
stimulation. pkb binds pp2a known substrate pp2a. here, show 
hpv e7 also binds 35 kda catalytic 65 kda structural subunits 
pp2a, interaction sequesters subunits inhibits their
interaction pkb, thereby maintaining pkb/akt signaling inhibiting its
dephosphorylation.
