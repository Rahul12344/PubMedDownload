the processing lagging-strand intermediates demonstrated vitro
for herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1). human flap endonuclease-1 (fen-1) was
examined ability produce ligatable products model lagging-strand 
intermediates presence wild-type exonuclease-deficient (exo(-)) 
hsv-1 dna polymerase (pol). primer/templates composed minicircle
single-stranded dna template annealed primers contained 5' dna flaps or
5' annealed dna rna sequences. gapped dna primer/templates extended but
not significantly strand displaced wild-type hsv-1 pol, although
significant strand displacement observed exo(-) hsv-1 pol. nevertheless,
the incubation primer/templates containing 5' flaps either wild-type or
exo(-) hsv-1 pol fen-1 led efficient production nicks could be
sealed dna ligase i. polymerases stimulated nick translation
activity fen-1 dna- rna-containing primer/templates, indicating the
activities coordinated. evidence fen-1 involvement hsv-1 dna 
synthesis suggested ability transiently expressed green
fluorescent protein fusion fen-1 accumulate viral dna replication
compartments infected cells ability endogenous fen-1 to
coimmunoprecipitate essential viral dna replication protein in
hsv-1-infected cells.
