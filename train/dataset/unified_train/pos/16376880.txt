the hbx protein hepatitis b virus involved deregulation cell cycle
and development hepatocellular carcinoma. since c-myc also plays important 
role cell proliferation tumor development, studied regulation by
hbx human hepatoma cell line. co-expression hbx c-myc resulted in
increased stability intracellular c-myc. hbx blocked ubiquitination myc
through direct interaction f box region skp2 destabilization of
the scf(skp2) complex. suggest sustained presence c-myc combined 
mitogenic activity inherent hbx may associated cell cycle deregulation
and transformation.
