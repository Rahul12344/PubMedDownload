hiv-1 vpr virion-associated protein. activities link viral
pathogenesis disease progression hiv-infected patients. vitro, vpr
moderately activates hiv-1 replication proliferating cells, is
required efficient viral infection replication vivo non-dividing
cells macrophages. exactly vpr contributes viral replication
remains elusive. show vpr stimulates hiv-1 replication least in
part interaction hhr23a, protein binds 19s subunit 
the 26s proteasome shuttles ubiquitinated proteins proteasome for
degradation. vpr-proteasome interaction initially discovered fission
yeast, vpr shown associate mts4 mts2, two 19s-associated
proteins. interaction vpr 19s subunit proteasome was
further confirmed mammalian cells vpr associates mammalian
orthologues fission yeast mts4 s5a. consistently, depletion hhr23a
interrupts interaction vpr proteasome mammalian cells. furthermore,
vpr promotes hhr23a-mediated protein-ubiquitination, down-regulation of
hhr23a using rnai significantly reduced viral replication non-proliferating
magi-ccr5 cells primary macrophages. findings suggest that
vpr-proteasome interaction might counteract certain host restriction factor(s) to
stimulate viral replication non-dividing cells.
