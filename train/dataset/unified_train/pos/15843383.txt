the human polyomavirus jc virus (jcv) causative agent fatal
demyelinating disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, encodes
six major proteins, including agnoprotein. agnoprotein colocalizes with
microtubules jcv-infected cells, function fully understood. 
have identified fasciculation elongation protein zeta 1 (fez1) a
protein interacted jcv agnoprotein yeast two-hybrid screen a
human brain cdna library. vitro binding assay showed agnoprotein
interacted directly fez1 microtubules. microtubule cosedimentation
assay revealed fez1 also associates microtubules agnoprotein
induces dissociation fez1 microtubules. agnoprotein inhibited the
promotion fez1 neurite outgrowth pc12 cells. conversely, overexpression 
of fez1 suppressed jcv protein expression intracellular trafficking in
jcv-infected cells. results suggest fez1 promotes neurite extension
through interaction microtubules, agnoprotein facilitates jcv
propagation inducing dissociation fez1 microtubules.
