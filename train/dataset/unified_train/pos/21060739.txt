herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) protein icp27 many important functions
during infection achieved interactions number cellular
proteins. role viral rna export protein, icp27 interacts with
tap/nxf1, cellular mrna export receptor, n c termini of
icp27 must intact interaction take place. show by
bimolecular fluorescence complementation (bifc) icp27 interacts directly
with tap/nxf1 infection, interaction failed occur an
icp27 mutant bearing substitutions serines cysteines positions 483 
488 c-terminal zinc finger. recently, showed icp27 undergoes a
head-to-tail intramolecular interaction, could make n- c-terminal
regions accessible binding tap/nxf1. determine importance of
intramolecular association icp27 interaction tap/nxf1, we
performed bifc-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (fret) acceptor
photobleaching. bifc-based fret showed interaction icp27 and
tap/nxf1 occurred living cells upon head-to-tail intramolecular association of
icp27, establishing tap/nxf1 interacts n c termini
of icp27.
