we show macroh2a1 histone variants important repressing the
expression endogenous murine leukemia viruses (mlvs) mouse liver. intact
mlv proviruses proviruses deletions env nearly silent normal 
mouse liver showed substantial derepression macroh2a1 knockout liver. in
contrast, mlv proviruses deletion 5' end pro-pol expressed 
in normal liver showed relatively low levels derepression knockout
liver. macroh2a1 nucleosomes enriched endogenous mlvs, highest
enrichment occurring 5' end pro-pol. absence macroh2a1 also led 
to localized loss dna methylation 5' ends mlv proviruses. these
results demonstrate macroh2a1 histones significant role silencing 
endogenous mlvs vivo suggest specific internal mlv sequences are
targeted macroh2a1-dependent silencing mechanism.
