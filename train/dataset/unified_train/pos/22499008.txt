hepatitis b virus (hbv)-encoded x protein (hbx protein) multi-functional
regulatory protein. functions protein-protein interaction plays a
pivotal role pathogenesis hbv-related diseases. however, partners
in hepatocytes interacting hbx protein far understood fully. in
this study, immunoprecipitation employed screen binding partners for
the hbx protein huh-7 hepatoma cells infected recombinant adenovirus
expressing hbx protein, five cellular proteins including eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1 (eef1a1), identified. the
interaction hbx protein eef1a1 confirmed using gst
pull-down assay co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. huh-7 hepatoma
cells, hbx protein inhibits dimer formation eef1a1, hence blocks
filamentous actin bundling. findings provide new insights the
molecular mechanisms involved functions hbx protein.
