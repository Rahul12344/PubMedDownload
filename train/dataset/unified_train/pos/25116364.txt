background: human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) tat protein plays essential
role hiv gene transcription hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) and
replication. transcriptional activity tat modulated several host
factors, mechanism responsible tat regulation host factors 
understood fully.
results: using yeast two-hybrid screening system, identified nuclear
ubiquitous casein cyclin-dependent kinase substrate 1 (nucks1) novel
tat-interacting partner. here, report function positive regulator 
tat. coimmunoprecipitation assay, hiv-1 tat interacted sufficiently with
both endogenous ectopically expressed nucks1. reporter assay, ectopic
expression nucks1 significantly increased tat-mediated transcription the
hiv-1 ltr, whereas knockdown nucks1 small interfering rna diminished
tat-mediated transcription hiv-1 ltr. also investigated mechanism
contributes nucks1-mediated tat activation. chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay (chip), knockdown nucks1 interrupted accumulation tat the
transactivation-responsive (tar) region ltr, led suppression
of viral replication. however, nucks1 expression increase tat nuclear
localization interaction cyclin t1. interestingly, nucks1 expression
level lower latently hiv-1-infected cells uninfected parent cells.
besides, expression level nucks1 markedly induced, facilitated 
hiv-1 reactivation latently infected cells.
conclusion: taken together, data demonstrate clearly nucks1 novel
tat coactivator required tat-mediated hiv-1 transcription and
replication, may contribute hiv-1 reactivation latently hiv-1
infected cells.
