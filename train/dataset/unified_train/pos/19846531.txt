west nile virus capsid protein (wnvcp) displays pathogenic toxicity via the
apoptotic pathway. however, cellular mechanism protective toxic
effect observed far. here, identified makorin ring finger
protein 1 (mkrn1) novel e3 ubiquitin ligase wnvcp. cytotoxic effects
of wnvcp well expression levels inhibited u2os cells that
stably expressed mkrn1. immunoprecipitation analyses revealed interaction
between mkrn1 wnvcp. domain analysis indicated c terminus mkrn1
and n terminus wnvcp required interaction. mkrn1 could induce
wnvcp ubiquitination degradation proteasome-dependent manner.
interestingly, wnvcp mutant amino acids 1 105 deleted wnvcp was
degraded mkrn1, whereas mutant amino acids 1 90 deleted not.
when three lysine sites positions 101, 103, 104 wnvcp replaced
with alanine, mkrn1-mediated ubiquitination degradation mutant were
significantly inhibited, suggesting sites required the
ubiquitination. finally, u2os cell lines stably expressing mkrn1 resistant
to cytotoxic effects wnv. contrast, cells depleted mkrn1 more
susceptible wnvcp cytotoxicity. confirming this, overexpression mkrn1
significantly reduced, depletion mkrn1 increased, wnv proliferation in
293t cells. taken together, results suggest mkrn1 protect cells from
wnv inducing wnvcp degradation.
