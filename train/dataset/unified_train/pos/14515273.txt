surfactant protein (sp-a) lactoferrin (lf) play important roles innate
immune systems respiratory mucous membranes. investigated sp-a 
lf act respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) infection. present study
indicated rsv-induced il-8 secretion hep-2 cells up-regulated by
sp-a (170% control) down-regulated lf (23% control). rsv infectivity
determined viral titers uptake fitc-labeled rsv also increased
by sp-a, decreased lf. clarify mechanism opposite effects,
we examined interactions sp-a lf rsv f protein, most
important surface glycoprotein viral penetration. rsv f protein found 
be ligand sp-a lf, manners binding different. lf
directly interacted f(1) subunit, involved antigenic sites f
protein. contrarily, sp-a associated f(2) subunit, highly
glycosylated. sp-a lf failed interact deglycosylated f protein.
moreover, sp-a initiated hemolyzing fusion activity f protein. these
results suggest sp-a lf modulate rsv infection different binding
specificity f protein.
