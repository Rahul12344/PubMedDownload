hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a) required the
replication viral genome involved several host signaling
pathways. gain insight functional role ns5a hcv
replication, screened human cdna libraries yeast two-hybrid system using 
ns5a bait identified human butyrate-induced transcript 1 (hb-ind1) 
a novel ns5a-binding protein. endogenously exogenously expressed hb-ind1 
coimmunoprecipitated ns5a various genotypes coiled-coil
domain hb-ind1. small interfering rna (sirna)-mediated knockdown of
hb-ind1 human hepatoma cell lines suppressed replication hcv rna
replicons production infectious particles hcv genotype 2a strain
jfh1. furthermore, reductions canceled expression an
sirna-resistant hb-ind1 mutant. among ns5a-binding host proteins involved 
hcv replication, hb-ind1 exhibited binding fkbp8, hb-ind1 interacted
with hsp90 fxxw motif n-terminal p23 homology domain. the
impairment replication hcv rna replicons production of
infectious particles jfh1 virus hb-ind1 knockdown cell lines not
reversed expression sirna-resistant hb-ind1 mutant fxxw
motif replaced axxa. results suggest hb-ind1 plays crucial
role hcv rna replication propagation jfh1 virus interaction
with viral host proteins.
