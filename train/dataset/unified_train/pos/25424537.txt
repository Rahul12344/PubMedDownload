viral proteins bind numerous cellular viral proteins throughout the
infection cycle. however, mechanisms viral proteins interact with
such large numbers factors remain unknown. cellular proteins interact
with multiple, distinct partners often short sequences known as
molecular recognition features (morfs) embedded within intrinsically disordered
regions (idrs). study, report first evidence morfs viral
proteins play similar role targeting host cell. using combination of
evolutionary modeling, protein-protein interaction analyses forward genetic
screening, systematically investigated two computationally predicted morfs
within n-terminal idr hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein. sequence
analysis morfs showed conservation across hcv genotypes 
canine equine hepaciviruses. phylogenetic modeling indicated core
morfs stronger purifying selection surrounding sequence,
suggesting modules biological function. using yeast
two-hybrid assay, identified three cellular binding partners hcv core
morf, including two previously characterized cellular targets hcv core (ddx3x 
and npm1). random site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated predicted
morf regions required binding cellular proteins, that
different residues within morf critical binding different
partners. study demonstrated viruses may use intrinsic disorder to
target multiple cellular proteins amino acid sequence provides 
a framework characterizing binding partners disordered regions
in viral cellular proteomes.
