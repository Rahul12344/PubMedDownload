background: oncoproteins encoded early region adenoviruses been
shown powerful tools study gene regulatory mechanisms, affect
major cellular events proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
oncogenic transformation. possesing key role favor viral
replication via interaction multiple cellular proteins. yeast
two-hybrid screen identified sprouty1 (spry1) target adenoviral
e1a oncoproteins. spry proteins central complex regulators the
receptor tyrosine kinase (rtk) signalling pathway. deregulation spry
family members often associated alterations rtk signalling its
downstream effectors, leading erk pathway.
results: here, confirm yeast two-hybrid data, showing interaction
between spry1 e1a gst pull-down immunoprecipitation assays. also
demonstrated interaction e1a two spry isoforms. using
deletion mutants identified n-terminus cr conserved region (cr) 3 
of e1a- c-terminal half spry1, contains highly conserved
spry domain, essential sites direct interaction spry e1a. 
immunofluorescent microscopy data revealed co-localization e1a(13s) with
spry1 cytoplasm. sre tre reporter assays demonstrated that
co-expression spry1 e1a(13s) abolishes inhibitory function spry1
in rtk signalling, consequently accompanied decrease of
e1a13s-induced gene expression.
conclusions: results establish spry1 cytoplasmic localized cellular
target e1a oncoproteins regulate rtk signalling pathway, and
consequently cellular events downstream rtk essential viral
replication transformation.
