to identify host factors implicated regulation hepatitis c virus
(hcv) genome replication, performed comparative proteome analyses hcv
replication complex (rc)-rich membrane fractions prepared cells harboring
genome-length bicistronic hcv rna exponential stationary growth
phases. found eukaryotic chaperonin t-complex polypeptide 1
(tcp1)-ring complex/chaperonin-containing tcp1 (tric/cct) plays role the
replication possibly interaction subunit cct5 viral
rna polymerase ns5b. sirna-mediated knockdown cct5 suppressed rna replication 
and production infectious virus. gain-of-function activity shown
following co-transfection whole eight tric/cct subunits. hcv rna synthesis
was inhibited anti-cct5 antibody cell-free assay. suggest that
recruitment chaperonin viral nonstructural proteins rc,
which potentially facilitate folding rc component(s) mature
active form, may important efficient replication hcv genome.
