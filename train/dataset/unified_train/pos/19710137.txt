kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (also named human herpesvirus 8) a
gamma-herpesvirus undergoes lytic latent infection. latent
infection, two viral elements required: latency-associated nuclear antigen
(lana), functions origin binding protein, latent origin,
which resides within terminal repeats (trs) viral genome. previously, 
we identified two cis-elements within trs required latent dna
replication: two lana binding sites (lbs1 lbs2 [lbs1/2]) gc-rich
replication element (re) upstream lbs1/2. characterize re, we
constructed 71-bp minimal replicon (mr) performed detailed mutational
analysis. data indicate first 8 nucleotides within are
critical replication. moreover, position distance between
the lbs1/2 affect origin replication activity, suggesting 
may function loading pad cellular proteins involved replication.
using biotinylated dna fragments wild-type mutant mrs probes, we
identified 30 proteins preferentially bind origin. among these
proteins, structure-specific recognition protein 1 (ssrp1), subunit fact
complex, telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (trf2) formed complexes lana 
at mr region. furthermore, small interfering rna-based knockdown of
ssrp1, dominant-negative-based knockdown trf2, significantly
decreased efficiency lana-dependent dna replication. results
indicate ssrp1 novel cellular protein involved lana-dependent dna
replication.
