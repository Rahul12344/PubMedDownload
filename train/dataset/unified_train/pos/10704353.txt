transcription hiv-1 long terminal repeat (ltr) regulated viral
transactivator tat, increases rna polymerase ii (rnap ii) processivity.
previous reports demonstrated phosphorylation rnap ii
carboxy-terminal domain tfiih p-tefb important tat transactivation.
our present results demonstrate phosphorylation rap74 subunit of
tfiif also important step tat transactivation. interestingly, 
general transcription factor tfiif required basal tat-activated
transcription, phosphorylation rap74 subunit occurs presence tat
and correlates high level transcription activity. using biotinylated 
dna template transcription assay, provide evidence rap74 is
phosphorylated taf(ii)250 tat-activated transcription. depletion of
rap74 hela nuclear extract inhibited hiv-1 ltr-driven basal
transcription tat transactivation. addition tfiif, reconstituted 
recombinant rap30 rap74, depleted hela nuclear extract resulted in
restoration tat transactivation. importance, exogenous rap74 was
rapidly phosphorylated presence tat. results suggest rap74
phosphorylation one important step, several, tat transactivation
cascade.
