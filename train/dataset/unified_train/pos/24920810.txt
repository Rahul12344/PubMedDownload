kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv, also called human herpesvirus 8)
is linked development kaposi's sarcoma (ks), primary effusion lymphoma 
(pel), multicentric castleman's disease (mcd). kshv expresses several
proteins modulate host cell signaling pathways. one proteins is
viral interleukin-6 (vil-6), homolog human il-6 (hil-6). vil-6 is
able prevent apoptosis promote proinflammatory signaling, angiogenesis,
and cell proliferation. although secreted, vil-6 mainly an
intracellular protein retained endoplasmic reticulum (er). we
performed affinity purification mass spectrometry identify novel vil-6
binding partners found cellular er chaperone, hypoxia-upregulated
protein 1 (hyou1), interacts vil-6. immunohistochemical staining reveals
that pel ks tumor tissues express significant amounts hyou1. also 
show hyou1 increases endogenous vil-6 protein levels hyou1
facilitates vil-6-induced jak/stat signaling, migration, survival in
endothelial cells. furthermore, data suggest hyou1 also modulates
vil-6's ability induce ccl2, chemokine involved cell migration. finally, 
we investigated impact hyou1 cellular hil-6 signaling. collectively,
our data indicate hyou1 important vil-6 function may play role 
in pathogenesis kshv-associated cancers.importance: kshv vil-6 is
detectable kshv-associated malignancies promotes tumorigenesis and
inflammation. identified cellular protein, called hypoxia-upregulated
protein 1 (hyou1), interacts kshv vil-6 present kshv-infected
tumors. data suggest hyou1 facilitates vil-6-induced signaling,
migration, survival endothelial cells.
