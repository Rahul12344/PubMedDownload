the nef protein hiv-1 essential pathogenicity known to
down-regulate mhc expression infected cell surfaces. show nef also
redistributes costimulatory molecules cd80 cd86 away cell
surface human monocytic u937 cell line well mouse macrophages and
dendritic cells. furthermore, hiv-1-infected u937 cells human blood-derived
macrophages show similar loss cell surface cd80 cd86. nef colocalizes
with mhc class (mhci), cd80, cd86 intracellular compartments, binds 
to mouse human cd80 cd86. nef mutants defective mhci
down-modulation, including one clinical isolate, remain capable of
down-modulating cd80 cd86. nef-mediated loss surface cd80/cd86 is
functionally significant, leads compromised activation naive t
cells. novel immunomodulatory role nef may potential importance 
explaining correlations macrophage-tropism nef hiv-1
pathogenicity immune evasion.
