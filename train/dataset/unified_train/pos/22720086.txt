hepatitis c virus (hcv) affects nearly 200 million people worldwide a
leading factor serious chronic liver diseases. replicating hcv genome,
the membrane-associated replication machinery needs formed hcv
non-structural proteins including ns5a human host factors. recently ns5a 
been identified bind er-anchored human vap proteins consequently this
interaction may serve novel target design anti-hcv drugs. far no
biophysical characterization interaction reported. here, we
dissected 243-residue vapb 4 447-residue ns5a 10 fragments,
followed cd nmr characterization structural properties.
subsequently, binding interactions fragments extensively 
assessed nmr hsqc titration powerful detecting even weak
binding. studies lead three important findings: 1). "fuzzy complex" is
formed intrinsically-unstructured third domain (d3) ns5a the
well-structured msp domain vapb, average dissociation constant (kd) of
~5 Âµm. 2). binding-important residues ns5a-d3 vapb-msp 
successfully mapped out, provided experimental constraints constructing
the complex structure. complex, unstructured d3 binds three surface
pockets one side msp structure. interestingly, two als-causing
mutations t46i p56s also located d3-msp interface. moreover,
ns5a-d3, ffat-containing proteins epha4 appear overlapped binding
interfaces msp domain. 3). ns5a-d3 experimentally confirmed to
competes epha4 binding msp domain, t46i mutation msp
dramatically abolishes binding ability d3. study provides
essential foundation deciphering structure function hcv
replication machinery, may also shed light rationalizing recent
observation chronic hcv patient surprisingly developed als-like syndrome.
