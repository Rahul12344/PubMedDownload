poxviruses dna viruses known replicate assemble the
cytoplasm infected cells. poxvirus morphogenesis complicated process in
which four distinct infectious forms virus produced: intracellular
mature virus, intracellular enveloped virus, cell-associated enveloped virus, and
extracellular enveloped virus. source primary membrane wrapping the
intracellular mature virus, first infectious form, still unknown. although
the membrane suggested originate endoplasmic reticulum-golgi
intermediate compartment, none marker proteins cell
compartments found intracellular mature virus. thus, was
hypothesized membrane either extensively modified virus or
synthesized de novo. work described here, demonstrate host cell 
protein residing trans-golgi network membrane, golgin-97, transported
to sites virus replication assembly becomes incorporated 
virions poxvirus infection. inside virion, golgin-97 associated
with insoluble core protein fraction. able adopt long rod-like
structure, protein apparently extends virion envelope and
protrudes surface. discuss potential role functions of
golgin-97 poxvirus replication propose two working models.
