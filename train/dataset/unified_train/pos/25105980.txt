virus particles (virions) often contain virus-encoded also
host-encoded proteins. host proteins enclosed within virion
structure, others, case enveloped viruses, embedded the
host-derived membrane. many host protein incorporations likely
accidental, may play role virus infectivity, replication and/or
immunoreactivity next host. host protein incorporations may especially 
important therapeutic applications large numbers virus particles 
administered. vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) prototypic rhabdovirus 
a candidate vaccine, gene therapy oncolytic vector. using mass spectrometry, 
we previously examined cell type dependent host protein content vsv virions
using intact ("whole") virions purified three cell lines originating from
different species. aimed determine localization host proteins
within vsv virions analyzing: i) whole vsv virions; ii) whole vsv
virions treated proteinase k remove proteins outside viral
envelope. total 257 proteins identified, 181 identified whole
virions 183 identified proteinase k treated virions. these
proteins previously shown associated vsv. functional
enrichment analysis indicated overrepresented categories proteins
associated vesicles, vesicle-mediated transport protein localization.
using western blotting, presence several host proteins, including not
previously shown association vsv (such yes1, prl1 ddx3y), was
confirmed relative quantities various virion fractions determined.
our study provides valuable inventory virion-associated host proteins for
further investigation roles replication cycle, pathogenesis and
immunoreactivity vsv.
