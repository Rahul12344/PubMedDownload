recognition pathogens innate immune system mediated pattern
recognition receptors (prrs), recognize specific molecular structures of
the infectious agents subsequently trigger expression genes involved in
host defense. toll-like receptors (tlrs) represent well-characterized class 
membrane-bound prrs, rna helicase retinoic acid inducible gene (rig-i) 
has recently described novel cytoplasmic prr recognizing
double-stranded rna (dsrna). show activation signal transduction 
and induction cytokine expression paramyxovirus sendai virus is
dependent virus replication involves prrs cell-type-dependent manner.
while nonimmune cells relied entirely recognition dsrna rig-i for
activation antiviral response, myeloid cells utilized the
single-stranded rna sensing tlr7 tlr8 dsrna-dependent mechanisms
independent rig-i, tlr3, dsrna-activated protein kinase r trigger 
response. therefore, appears large degree cell-type specificity 
in mechanisms used host recognize infecting viruses.
