our previous studies demonstrated hepatitis e virus (hev) requires the
multivesicular body (mvb) pathway release virus particles, suggesting hev
utilizes cellular escrt machinery cytoplasm, cell surface, 
to released infected cells. study, generated murine
monoclonal antibody (mab) membrane-associated hev particles to
examine whether membrane derived intracellular vesicles cell
surface. established mab, ta1708, found capture membrane-associated
hev particles, membrane-dissociated particles fecal hev, an
immunocapture rt-pcr assay. furthermore, digitonin treatment confirmed the
membrane surface cell-culture-generated hev particles lipid
membrane. double immunofluorescence staining revealed mab ta1708
specifically recognizes trans-golgi network protein 2 (tgoln2), intracellular 
antigen derived trans-golgi network. supporting findings, hev
particles lipid membranes orf3 proteins surface found
abundantly lysates hev-infected cells. results indicate hev 
forms membrane-associated particles cytoplasm, likely budding into
intracellular vesicles, released hev particles lipid membrane
retain antigenicity tgoln2 surface.
