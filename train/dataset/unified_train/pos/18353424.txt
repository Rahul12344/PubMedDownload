the 68k ankyrin-like protein (68k-ank) unknown function highly conserved
among orthopoxviruses contains ankyrin repeats f-box-like domain. we
performed yeast-two-hybrid screen 68k-ank find interacting proteins.
from human murine cdna library, 99% interaction partners were
s-phase kinase-associated protein 1a (skp1a), part scf ubiquitin ligase 
complex. 68k-ank co-immunoprecipitated components endogenous,
mammalian scf ubiquitin ligase. interaction f-box domain dependent and
could also observed infected cells, indicating scf complex formation
might important viral life cycle.
