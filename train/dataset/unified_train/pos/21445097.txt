chromatin assembly factor 1 (caf1) consisting p150, p60 p48 known to
assemble histones onto newly synthesized dna thus maintain chromatin
structure. here, show caf1 expression induced human
cytomegalovirus (hcmv)-infected cells, concomitantly global chromatin
decondensation. apparent conflict thought result, part, caf1 
mislocalization compartments hcmv dna synthesis binding its
largest subunit p150 viral immediate-early protein 2 (ie2). p150 interaction
with p60 ie2 facilitated hcmv dna synthesis. ie2q548r mutation,
previously reported result impaired hcmv growth unknown mechanism,
disrupted ie2/p150 ie2/histones association study. moreover, ie2
interaction histones partly depends p150, hcmv-induced chromatin 
decondensation reduced cells ectopically expressing p150 mutant
defective ie2 binding. results indicate caf1 hijacked 
by ie2 facilitate replication hcmv genome, suggesting chromatin
assembly plays important role herpesviral dna synthesis, also provide a
model virus-induced chromatin instability caf1.
