viruses flavivirus genus flaviviridae family are
arthropod-transmitted contribute staggering numbers human infections
and significant deaths annually across globe. identify cellular factors
with antiviral activity flaviviruses, screened cdna library using an
iterative approach. identified mammalian hsp40 chaperone protein (dnajc14)
that overexpressed able mediate protection yellow fever virus
(yfv)-induced cell death. studies revealed dnajc14 inhibits yfv at
the step viral rna replication. since replication bovine viral diarrhea
virus (bvdv), member related pestivirus genus, also known be
modulated dnajc14, tested effect host factor diverse
flaviviridae family members. flaviviruses, including pathogenic asibi strain 
of yfv, kunjin, tick-borne langat virus, well hepacivirus, hepatitis 
c virus (hcv), inhibited overexpression dnajc14. mutagenesis
showed j-domain c-terminal domain, mediates
self-interaction, required anti-yfv activity. found dnajc14 
not block yfv hcv ns2-3 cleavage, using non-inhibitory mutants
demonstrate dnajc14 recruited yfv replication complexes.
immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated endogenous dnajc14 rearranges
during infection found replication complexes identified dsrna
staining. interestingly, silencing endogenous dnajc14 results impaired yfv 
replication suggesting requirement dnajc14 yfv replication complex
assembly. finally, antiviral activity overexpressed dnajc14 occurs a
time- dose-dependent manner. dnajc14 overexpression may disrupt proper
stoichiometry resulting inhibition, overcome upon restoration 
the optimal ratios due accumulation viral nonstructural proteins. our
findings, together previously published work, suggest members of
the flaviviridae family evolved unique important ways interact
with host hsp40 chaperone molecule.
