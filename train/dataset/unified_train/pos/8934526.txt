the protein tat encoded hiv-1 genome essential viral
replication activation viral transcription. tat enhances the
ability rna polymerase ii (pol ii) move long distances dna through
a poorly understood mechanism involves binding 5' end 
nascent hiv-1 transcript. suggested stimulation of
transcript elongation conventional dna-binding activators may involve
phosphorylation carboxy-terminal domain (ctd) pol ii the
transcription factor tfiih associated cak kinase. show that
tat-enhanced hiv-1 transcription vitro requires tfiih ctd pol 
ii. addition, tat, activation domain, interacts a
functional tfiih-containing complex stimulates phosphorylation a
ctd-containing substrate tfiih kinase. conditions jointly
restrict transcriptional elongation tfiih-mediated ctd phosphorylation, tat
stimulates activities. furthermore, rna synthesis required tat 
to stimulate phosphorylation ctd part initiation complex,
as expected tat's interaction viral transcripts. thus, stimulation of
pol ii elongation tat may involve direct effects tfiih-mediated ctd
phosphorylation.
