our recent studies demonstrated apolipoprotein e mediates cell attachment of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) interactions cell surface heparan
sulfate (hs). hs known covalently attach core proteins form heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (hspgs) cell surface. hspg core proteins include
the membrane-spanning syndecans (sdcs), lycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked
glypicans (gpcs), basement membrane proteoglycan perlecan (hspg2), agrin.
in present study, profiled hspg core proteins hcv
attachment. substantial evidence derived studies demonstrates sdc1 
is major receptor protein hcv attachment. knockdown sdc1
expression small interfering rna (sirna)-induced gene silence resulted a
significant reduction hcv attachment huh-7.5 cells stem
cell-differentiated human hepatocytes. silence sdc2 expression also caused
a modest decrease hcv attachment. contrast, sirna-mediated knockdown of
other sdcs, gpcs, hspg2, agrin effect hcv attachment. more
importantly, ectopic expression sdc1 able completely restore hcv
attachment huh-7.5 cells endogenous sdc1 expression silenced 
by specific sirnas. interestingly, mouse sdc1 also fully functional in
mediating hcv attachment expressed sdc1-deficient cells, consistent
with recent reports mouse hepatocytes also susceptible hcv infection 
when expressing key hcv receptors. collectively, findings demonstrate
that sdc1 serves major receptor protein hcv attachment cells,
providing another potential target discovery development antiviral
drugs hcv.
