checkpoint kinase 1 (chk1) mediates diverse cellular responses genotoxic
stress, regulating network genome-surveillance pathways coordinate
cell cycle progression dna repair. chk1 essential mammalian
development viability, shown important g(2)
checkpoints. present evidence htlv-1 tax protein interacts
directly chk1 impairs kinase activities vitro vivo. the
direct physical interaction chk1 tax observed htlv-1-infected t
cells (c81, hut 102 mt-2) transfected fibroblasts (293 t) by
coimmunoprecipitation vitro gst pull-down assays. interestingly, tax
inhibited kinase activity chk1 protein vitro vivo kinase
assays. consistent results, tax inhibited the
phosphorylation-dependent degradation cdc25a g(2) arrest response to
gamma-irradiation (ir) dose-dependent manner vivo. g(2) arrest did
not require chk2 p53. studies provide first example viral
transforming protein targeting chk1 provide important insights into
checkpoint pathway regulation.
