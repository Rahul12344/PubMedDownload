the e6ap ubiquitin ligase catalyzes high-risk human papillomaviruses'
e6-mediated ubiquitylation p53, contributing neoplastic progression 
cells infected viruses. defects activity dosage e6ap
are linked angelman syndrome autism spectrum disorders, respectively,
highlighting need precise control enzyme. exception of
herc2, modulates ubiquitin ligase activity e6ap, little known
about regulation function e6ap normally. using proteomic approach, we
have identified validated several new e6ap-interacting proteins, including
hif1an, neurl4, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (mapk6). e6ap exists as
part several different protein complexes, including proteasome an
independent high-molecular-weight complex containing herc2, neurl4, mapk6. in
examining functional consequence interaction proteasome, we
found ube3c (another proteasome-associated ubiquitin ligase), e6ap, 
contributes proteasomal processivity mammalian cells. also found e6
associates herc2-containing high-molecular-weight complex its
binding e6ap. proteomic studies reveal level complexity e6ap
that previously appreciated identify number new cellular
proteins e6ap may regulated functioning.
