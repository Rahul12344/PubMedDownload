hepatitis c virus (hcv) major cause chronic liver disease. hcv ns5a
protein plays important role hcv infection interactions with
other hcv proteins host factors. attempt understanding
of biological context protein interactions ns5a host factors
in hcv pathogenesis, generated extensive physical interaction map between
ns5a cellular factors. combining yeast two-hybrid assay with
comprehensive literature mining, built ns5a interactome composed 132
human proteins interact ns5a. interactions integrated a
high-confidence human protein interactome (hpi) help targetmine
data warehouse system infer overall protein interaction map linking ns5a
with components host cellular networks. ns5a-host interactions
that integrated hpi shown participate compact and
well-connected cellular networks. functional analysis ns5a "infection"
network using targetmine highlighted cellular pathways associated immune
system, cellular signaling, cell adhesion, cellular growth death among
others, significantly targeted ns5a-host interactions. addition,
cellular assays vitro hcv cell culture systems identified two
er-localized host proteins rtn1 rtn3 novel regulators hcv propagation. 
our analysis builds upon present understanding role ns5a protein in
hcv pathogenesis provides potential targets effective anti-hcv
therapeutic intervention.
