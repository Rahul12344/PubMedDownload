hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna replication requires viral nonstructural proteins 
well cellular factors. recently, cellular protein, synaptotagmin-binding,
cytoplasmic rna-interacting protein (syncrip), also known nsap1, found 
bind hcv rna enhance hcv ires-dependent translation. investigate whether
this protein also involved hcv rna replication. found syncrip
was associated detergent-resistant membrane fractions colocalized with
newly-synthesized hcv rna. knock-down syncrip sirna significantly decreased
the amount hcv rna cells containing subgenomic replicon a
full-length viral rna. lastly, vitro replication assay after
immunodepletion syncrip showed syncrip directly involved hcv rna
replication. findings indicate syncrip dual functions,
participating rna replication translation hcv life cycle.
