inflammasomes cytosolic protein complexes stimulate activation of
caspase-1, turn induces secretion inflammatory cytokines
interleukin-1β (il-1β) il-18. recent studies indicated the
inflammasome known nod-like-receptor-family, pyrin domain-containing 3
(nlrp3) inflammasome recognizes several rna viruses, including influenza 
encephalomyocarditis viruses, whereas retinoic acid-inducible gene (rig-i) 
inflammasome may detect vesicular stomatitis virus. demonstrate measles
virus (mv) infection induces caspase-1-dependent il-1β secretion human
macrophage-like cell line thp-1. gene knockdown experiments indicated il-1β 
secretion mv-infected thp-1 cells mediated nlrp3 inflammasome but
not rig-i inflammasome. mv produces nonstructural v protein, has
been shown antagonize host innate immune responses. recombinant mv lacking
the v protein induced il-1β parental virus. thp-1 cells stably
expressing v protein suppressed nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated il-1β secretion. 
furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed v protein interacts
with nlrp3 carboxyl-terminal domain. nlrp3 located cytoplasmic
granular structures thp-1 cells stably expressing v protein, upon
inflammasome activation, nlrp3 redistributed perinuclear region, where
it colocalized v protein. results indicate v protein of
mv suppresses nlrp3 inflammasome-mediated il-1β secretion directly or
indirectly interacting nlrp3.
