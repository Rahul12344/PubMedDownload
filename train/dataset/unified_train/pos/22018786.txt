proteasomes represent major non-lysosomal mechanism responsible the
degradation proteins. following interferon γ treatment 3 proteasome subunits
are replaced producing immunoproteasomes. adenovirus e1a interacts with
components 20s 26s proteasome affect presentation peptides.
in light observations investigated relationship ade1a the
immunoproteasome. ade1a interacts immunoproteasome subunit, mecl1. in
contrast, ade1a binds poorly proteasome β2 subunit replaced by
mecl1 conversion proteasomes immunoproteasomes. binding sites e1a
for mecl1 correspond n-terminal region conserved region 3.
furthermore, ade1a causes down-regulation mecl1 expression, well lmp2
and lmp7, induced interferon γ treatment ad infections following
transient transfection. consistent previous reports ade1a reduced
ifnγ-stimulated stat1 phosphorylation appeared responsible its
ability reduce expression immunoproteasome subunits.
