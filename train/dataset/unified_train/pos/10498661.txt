several lines evidence suggest hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein may
modulate cellular transduction signals alter lipid metabolism. have
investigated binding hcv core protein cellular proteins combining 2 
yeast hybrid, confocal, surface plasmon resonance assays. results show
the direct binding viral protein apolipoprotein aii (apoaii) map
the interaction domain c-terminal hcv core protein. investigate 
biological relevance interaction hcv core lipid metabolism, we
took advantage well-established increase apoaii expression caused by
fibrates hepg2 cells. fenofibric acid treatment, show parallel
increase apoaii core protein secretion, effect abolished by
brefeldin a. study identifies apoaii one cellular targets hcv
core protein. also show intervention fenofibric acid cellular
lipid metabolism directly affects expression pattern hcv core protein.
