human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) immediate-early (ie) 2 protein (ie2) may play
important incompletely defined roles infection. used yeast
two-hybrid screening detect proteins interacting hhv-6 ie2, found
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k (hnrnp k) beta subunit of
casein kinase 2 (ck2beta) specifically interacted hhv-6 ie2. the
interactions confirmed gst pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and
colocalization studies. findings indicate hhv-6 ie2 protein
interacts hnrnp k ck2, interactions may affect viral and
cellular rna transcription translation viral replication.
