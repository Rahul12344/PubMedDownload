lentiviruses hiv-1 traverse nuclear pore complexes (npc) infect
terminally differentiated non-dividing cells, unclear.
the cytoplasmic npc protein nup358/ranbp2 identified hiv-1 co-factor in
previous studies. report hiv-1 capsid (ca) binds directly the
cyclophilin domain nup358/ranbp2. fusion nup358/ranbp2 cyclophilin
(cyp) domain tripartite motif trim5 created novel inhibitor hiv-1 
replication, consistent interaction vivo. contrast cypa binding 
to hiv-1 ca, nup358 binding insensitive inhibition cyclosporine,
allowing contributions cypa nup358 distinguished. inhibition of
cypa reduced dependence nup358 nuclear basket protein nup153,
suggesting cypa regulates choice nuclear import machinery is
engaged virus. hiv-1 cyclophilin-binding mutants ca g89v p90a favored 
integration genomic regions higher density transcription units and
associated features wild type virus. integration preference wild type
virus presence cyclosporine similarly altered regions higher 
transcription density. contrast, hiv-1 ca alterations another patch 
capsid surface render virus less sensitive nup358 trn-sr2
depletion (ca n74d, n57a) resulted integration genomic regions sparse in
transcription units. groups ca mutants impaired replication in
hela cells human monocyte derived macrophages. findings link hiv-1
engagement cyclophilins integration targeting replication
efficiency provide insight conservation viral cyclophilin
