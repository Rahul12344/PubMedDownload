major protein complexes. deletion analysis qp demonstrated least one
of complexes plays important role qp activity. evidence that

transfections irf1-/-, irf2-/-, irf1,2-/- fibroblasts demonstrated 
absence irf1 irf2 reduced qp activity approximately same
extent mutation irf-binding site qp, strongly implicating irf2, 
perhaps irf1, regulation qp activity. notably, transcription qp
was inducible either alpha gamma interferon ebv-negative b cells but
rather shown constitutively activated irf1 irf2. this
observation suggests irf1 irf2 previously unrecognized role as
constitutive activators specific genes. additionally, data presented indicate 
that protein complex containing nonhistone architectural protein hmg-i(y)
binds region identified major transcription initiation site qp.
this observation raises possibility hmg-i(y)-induced dna bending plays a
role initiation transcription qp.
