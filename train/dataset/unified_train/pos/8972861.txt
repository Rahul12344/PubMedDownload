the hepatitis b virus x protein promiscuous transcriptional transactivator. 
transactivation x protein likely mediated binding to
different cellular factors. using yeast two-hybrid method, isolated a
clone encodes novel x-associated cellular protein: xap2. x xap2
interactions also occur vitro. antiserum raised xap2 recognizes a
cytoplasmic protein apparent molecular mass 36 kda. interaction
between x xap2 requires small region x containing amino acids 13-26.
from northern blot analyses, xap2 ubiquitously expressed liver-derived
and non-liver-derived cell lines well normal non-liver tissues. in
contrast, xap2 expressed low level normal human liver. in
transfection assays, overexpression xap2 abolishes transactivation x
protein. based results, suggest xap2 important cellular
negative regulator x protein, x-xap2 interaction may play role 
in hbv pathology.
