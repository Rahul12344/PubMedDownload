human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) evades t-cell recognition down-regulating
expression major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules 
the surfaces infected cells. contrary "missing-self" hypothesis,
hcmv-infected cells refractory lysis natural killer (nk) cells.
inhibition nk cell function mediated number hcmv immune evasion
molecules, operate delivering inhibitory signals nk cells and
preventing engagement activating ligands. one molecule ul142, is
an mhc class i-related glycoprotein encoded clinical isolates and
low-passage-number strains hcmv. ul142 known down-modulate surface
expression mhc class i-related chain (mica), ligand the
activating nk receptor nkg2d. however, mechanism ul142 interferes
with mica unknown. here, show ul142 localizes predominantly the
endoplasmic reticulum (er) cis-golgi apparatus. transmembrane domain of
ul142 mediates er localization, propose ul142 luminal
domain involved cis-golgi localization. also confirm ul142
down-modulates surface expression full-length mica alleles no
effect truncated allele mica*008. however, demonstrate first
time ul142 retains full-length mica alleles cis-golgi apparatus. in
addition, propose ul142 interacts nascent mica en route cell 
surface mature mica cell surface. data also demonstrate that
the ul142 luminal transmembrane domains involved recognition and
intracellular sequestration full-length mica alleles.
