hiv-1 strains use c-c-chemokine receptor 5, ccr5, coreceptor host
transmission. human ccr5 chemokine ligands inhibit binding infection, whereas
ccr5 mutations also inhibit infection preventing surface expression, resulting
in delayed progression aids. here, describe human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6a) 
chemokine, u83a, binds ccr5 higher affinity human chemokines,
displacing binding leading inhibition chemotaxis human
leukocytes. similarly, u83a inhibits infection hiv-1 strains use ccr5,
but cxcr4, coreceptor. unlike human ccr5 chemokine ligands induce
rapid ccr5 internalization mediated via clathrin, treatment u83a prevents
internalization. spliced truncated u83a isoform, u83a-n, also binds ccr5 albeit
with lower affinity, correlates lower hiv-1 infection inhibition,
whereas truncation abolishes binding inhibition. confocal
microscopy confirms ccr5 internalization inhibition u83a treatment, whereas
labeled transferrin uptake shows endocytosis via clathrin unaltered.
previous results show that, although u83a-n antagonist, u83a agonist 
for ccr1, ccr4, ccr6, ccr8 present immune effector antigen-presenting 
cells also shown ccr5. thus, u83a could act novel inhibitor 
hiv-1 infection also stimulating local immunity virus.
