ebola virus (ebov) protein l (ebol) acts viral rna-dependent rna polymerase.
to better understand mechanisms underlying transcription replication 
of ebov genome, sought identify cellular factors involved these
processes via coimmunoprecipitation ebol mass spectrometry. 
65 candidate proteins identified, focused dna topoisomerase 1 (top1), which
localizes nucleus unwinds helical dna. found presence
of ebol, top1 colocalizes interacts ebol cytoplasm, where
transcription replication ebov genome occur. knockdown top1
markedly reduced virus replication viral polymerase activity. also found
that phosphodiester bridge-cleaving recombination activities top1 
required polymerase activity ebol. results demonstrate top1
is important cellular factor transcription replication ebov
genome and, such, plays key role ebov life cycle.
