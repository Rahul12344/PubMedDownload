epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear protein 2 (ebna 2) acidic transcriptional 
transactivator virus cell gene expression essential growth
transformation primary b lymphocytes. ebna 2 transactivation response
elements (e2res) mediated interaction gtgggaa-specific
dna-binding factor(s). purify factor s-sepharose ebna 2
affinity chromatography identify single 63-kda protein. protein
is shown specifically coimmunoprecipitate ebna 2 lymphoblasts
transfected ebna 2 flag expression vector. mutation gtg tct a
gtgggaa motif common cp, lmp2, lmp1 promoters results loss of
recognition p63. ebna 2 amino acids 310-336 sufficient p63 binding.
the motif 27 amino acid sequence common ebna 2 genes
of ebv types 1 2 gppwwpp (i/v) (c/r) dp, therefore likely to
mediate p63 interaction. mutation ww ss ff ablates interaction p63,
indicating hydrophobic aromatic characteristics ww are
essential "key" interaction p63. ebna 2 ww mutated ss is
also unable marker rescue primary b lymphocyte transforming virus cells
infected ebna 2-deleted virus, otherwise isogenic wild-type ebna 2 
readily marker rescues transforming virus parallel experiments. ebna 2
transactivation cp e2re completely abolished ww ss
mutation transactivation -234 +40 lmp1 e2re partially
affected. genetic biochemical experiments support hypothesis that
ebna 2 ww interaction p63 gtgggaa-binding protein essential for
ebv-mediated cell growth transformation specifically associates ebna 2
with response elements. enables ebna 2 acidic domain to
transcriptionally transactivate specific genes.
