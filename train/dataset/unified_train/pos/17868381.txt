the west nile virus (wnv) capsid protein functions virus assembly package
genomic rna nucleocapsid structures. becoming clear, addition 
to structural roles, capsid proteins rna viruses non-structural
functions. example, wnv capsid protein implicated a
pathogenic determinant. presumably, many, all, non-structural
functions protein involve interactions host cell-encoded proteins.
in present study, used affinity purification isolate human proteins
that bind wnv capsid protein. one capsid binding proteins is
i(2)(pp2a), previously characterized inhibitor serine/threonine
phosphatase pp2a. mapping studies revealed capsid binding site overlaps with
the region i(2)(pp2a) required inhibition pp2a activity.
moreover, expression wnv capsid protein resulted significantly
increased pp2a activity expected downstream events, inhibition of
ap1-dependent transcription. infected cells treated i(2)(pp2a)-specific
sirnas produced less infectious virus control sirna-transfected cells, but
this difference minimal. together, data indicate interactions
between wnv capsid i(2)(pp2a) result increased pp2a activity. given the
central role phosphatase cellular physiology, capsid/i(2)(pp2a)
interactions may yet prove important viral pathogenesis.
