hepatitis c virus (hcv) particles assemble along low density lipoprotein
pathway released hepatocytes entities varying degree 
lipid apolipoprotein (apo) association well buoyant densities. little
is known cell entry pathway different hcv particle
subpopulations, likely occurs regulated spatiotemporal processes
involving several cell surface molecules. one molecules scavenger
receptor bi (sr-bi), receptor high density lipoprotein bind the
hcv glycoprotein e2. studying entry properties infectious virus
subpopulations differing buoyant densities, show hcv
particles utilize sr-bi manifold manner. first, sr-bi mediates primary
attachment hcv particles intermediate density cells. initial
interactions involve apolipoproteins, apolipoprotein e, present the
surface hcv particles, e2 glycoprotein, suggesting that
lipoprotein components virion act host-derived ligands important
entry factors sr-bi. second, found contrast initial
attachment, sr-bi mediates entry hcv particles independent buoyant
density. function sr-bi depend e2/sr-bi interaction but
relies lipid transfer activity sr-bi, probably facilitating entry
steps along hcv entry co-factors. finally, results underscore a
third function sr-bi governed specific residues hypervariable region 1
of e2 leading enhanced cell entry depending sr-bi ability bind to
e2.
