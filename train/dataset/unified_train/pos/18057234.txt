the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(mapk) pathway essential infection variety viruses. p90
ribosomal s6 kinases (rsks) direct substrates erk functional mediators
of erk mapk signaling, roles viral infection never been
examined. demonstrate orf45 kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(kshv) interacts rsk1 rsk2 strongly stimulates kinase
activities. activation rsk orf45 correlated erk activation 
does require mek. demonstrate rsk1/rsk2 activated during
kshv primary infection reactivation latency; subset rsk1/rsk2 is
present viral replication compartment nucleus. depletion of
rsk1/rsk2 small interfering rna specific inhibitor bi-d1870 suppresses 
kshv lytic gene expression progeny virion production, suggesting essential
role rsk1/rsk2 kshv lytic replication.
