the pathogenic subgroup c feline leukemia virus (felv-c) arises infected cats 
as result mutations envelope (env) subgroup felv (felv-a).
to better understand emergence felv-c potential felv intermediates that
may arise, characterized felv env sequences primary fy981 felv
isolate previously derived anemic cat. here, report the
characterization novel fy981 felv env highly related felv-a env
but whose variable region (vra) receptor recognition sequence partially
resembles vra sequence prototypical felv-c/sarma env. pseudotype
viruses bearing fy981 env capable infecting feline, human, guinea pig
cells, suggestive subgroup c phenotype, also infected porcine st-iowa
cells normally resistant felv-c felv-a. analysis host
receptor used fy981 suggests fy981 use felv-c receptor
flvcr1 feline felv-a receptor thtr1 infection. however, results
suggest fy981 infection st-iowa cells mediated porcine
homologue flvcr1 thtr1 alternative receptor, now
identified flvcr1-related protein flvcr2. together, results suggest
that fy981 felv uses flvcr1, flvcr2, thtr1 receptors. findings suggest
the possibility pathogenic felv-c arises felv-infected cats through
intermediates multitropic receptor use.
