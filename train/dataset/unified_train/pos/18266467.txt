the ikappab kinase (ikk) complex key regulator signal transduction
pathways leading induction nf-kappab-dependent gene expression and
production pro-inflammatory cytokines. therefore represents major target 
for development anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs may targeted by
pathogens seeking diminish host response infection. previously, the
vaccinia virus (vacv) strain western reserve b14 protein characterised 
intracellular virulence factor alters inflammatory response infection
by unknown mechanism. demonstrate ectopic expression b14
inhibited nf-kappab activation response tnfalpha, il-1beta, poly(i:c), 
pma. cells infected vacv lacking gene b14r (vdeltab14) higher
level phosphorylated ikappabalpha similar level ikappabalpha compared
to cells infected control viruses expressing b14, suggesting b14 affects ikk
activity. direct evidence obtained showing b14 co-purified
and co-precipitated endogenous ikk complex human mouse cells
and inhibited ikk complex enzymatic activity. notably, interaction between
b14 ikk complex required ikkbeta ikkalpha, suggesting the
interaction occurs via ikkbeta. b14 inhibited nf-kappab activation induced by
overexpression ikkalpha, ikkbeta, constitutively active mutant of
ikkalpha, s176/180e, inhibit comparable mutant ikkbeta,
s177/181e. suggested phosphorylation serine residues the
activation loop ikkbeta targeted b14, confirmed using ab
specific phospho-ikkbeta.
