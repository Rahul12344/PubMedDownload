one hallmarks human immunodeficiency virus type (hiv-1) infection 
the rapid removal viral receptor cd4 cell surface. this
remarkably efficient receptor interference requires activity three
separate viral proteins: env, vpu, nef. investigated whether this
unusually tight interference cell surface cd4 expression essential 
function viral life cycle simply preventing superinfection. we
now report removal cell surface cd4 required optimal virus
production hiv-1. indeed, maintenance cd4 surface expression infected
cells lead 3-5-fold decrease viral particle production. effect was
not due formation intracellular complexes cd4 gp160
viral envelope precursor instead required presence cd4 cell
surface specifically mediated cd4 closely related plasma
membrane receptors. finding cd4 significant effect particle
release vpu-deficient variant indicates cd4 acts inhibiting the
particle release-promoting activity vpu. co-immunoprecipitation experiments
further showed cd4 vpu physically interact cell surface,
suggesting cd4 might inhibit vpu activity disrupting oligomeric
structure.
