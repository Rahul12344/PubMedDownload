minor group human rhinoviruses (hrvs) bind three members low-density
lipoprotein receptor (ldlr) family: ldlr proper, very-ldlr (vldlr) and
ldlr-related protein (lrp). whereas icam-1, receptor major group hrvs
actively contributes viral uncoating, ldlrs rather considered passive
vehicles cargo delivery low-ph environment endosomes. since the
tyr-trp-thr-asp beta-propeller domain ldlr shown involved in
the dissociation bound ldl via intramolecular competition low ph, we
studied whether also plays role hrv infection. human cell lines deficient
in ldlr family proteins available. therefore, used cho-ldla7 cells
that lack endogenous ldlr. stably transfected express either
wild-type (wt) human ldlr mutant deletion beta-propeller. when
hrv2 attached propeller-negative ldlr, lower ph required for
conversion subviral particles attached wt ldlr. indicates
that high-avidity receptor binding maintains virus native
conformation. hrv2 internalization directed mutant ldlr wt ldlr to
lysosomes, resulting reduced plasma membrane expression propeller-negative 
ldlr. infection assays using cho-adapted hrv2 variant showed delay in
intracellular viral conversion de novo viral synthesis cells expressing
the truncated ldlr. data indicate beta-propeller attenuates the
virus-stabilizing effect ldlr binding thereby facilitates rna release from
endosomes, resulting enhancement infection. nice example a
virus exploiting high-avidity multimodule receptor binding intrinsic
release mechanism.
