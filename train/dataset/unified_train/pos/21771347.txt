post-transcriptional regulation hiv-1 gene expression mediated by
interactions viral transcripts viral/cellular proteins. hiv-1,
post-transcriptional nuclear control allows export intron-containing
rnas normally retained nucleus. specific signals viral
rnas, instability sequences (ins) rev responsive element (rre), are
binding sites viral cellular factors serve regulate rna-export.
the hiv-1 encoded viral rev protein binds rre found unspliced and
incompletely spliced viral rnas. binding rev directs export rnas 
from nucleus cytoplasm. previously, rev co-factors found 
include cellular factors crm1, ddx3, pimt others. work, the
nuclear matrix protein matrin 3 shown bind rev/rre-containing viral rna.
this binding interaction stabilizes unspliced partially spliced hiv-1
transcripts leading increased cytoplasmic expression viral rnas.
