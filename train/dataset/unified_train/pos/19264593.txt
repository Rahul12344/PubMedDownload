hepatitis b virus (hbv) gene transcription controlled viral promoters and
enhancers, activities regulated number cellular factors 
as well virally encoded proteins. negative regulation hbv cis-element
activities cellular factors reported less widely their
activation. study, report nuclear factor prospero-related
homeobox protein (prox1) represses hbv antigen expression genome replication 
in cultured hepatocytes. using reporter-gene analysis, three four hbv
promoters, namely enhancer ii/core promoter (enii/cp), pres1 promoter (sp1)
and enhancer i/x promoter, identified targets prox1-mediated
repression. mechanistic analysis revealed that, enii/cp, prox1 serves as
a corepressor liver receptor homologue 1 (lrh-1) downregulates
lrh-1-mediated activation enii/cp, whereas sp1, prox1 partially represses 
sp1 activity interacting directly hepatocyte nuclear factor 1.
identification prox1 hbv repressor help understanding of
detailed interactions viral cis elements host cellular factors and
may also form basis new anti-hbv intervention therapeutics.
