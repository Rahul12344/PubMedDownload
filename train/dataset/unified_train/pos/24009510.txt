hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein 2 (ns2) hydrophobic,
transmembrane protein required ns2-ns3 cleavage, also
for infectious virus production. identify cellular factors interact 
ns2 important hcv propagation, screened human liver cdna library
by split-ubiquitin membrane yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length ns2 a
bait, identified signal peptidase complex subunit 1 (spcs1), a
component microsomal signal peptidase complex. silencing endogenous
spcs1 resulted markedly reduced production infectious hcv, whereas neither 
processing structural proteins, cell entry, rna replication, release of
virus cells impaired. propagation japanese encephalitis virus was
not affected knockdown spcs1, suggesting spcs1 widely
modulate viral lifecycles flaviviridae family. spcs1 found to
interact ns2 e2. complex ns2, e2, spcs1 formed in
cells demonstrated co-immunoprecipitation assays. knockdown spcs1
impaired interaction ns2 e2. findings suggest spcs1 plays key 
role formation membrane-associated ns2-e2 complex via its
interaction ns2 e2, leads coordinating interaction between
the structural non-structural proteins facilitates early step of
assembly infectious particles.
