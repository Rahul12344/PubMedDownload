the human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) early ul4 promoter served useful model 
for studying activation early viral gene expression. previous
transient-transfection experiments detected cis-acting elements (the nf-y site
and site 2) upstream transcriptional start site (l. huang m. f.
stinski, j. virol. 69:7612-7621, 1995). roles two sites, nf-y
site site 2, context viral genome investigated 
comparing mrna levels early ul4 promoter human foreskin fibroblasts
infected recombinant viruses either wild-type mutant cis-acting
elements. steady-state mrna levels ul4 promoter mutation the
nf-y site comparable wild type. mutation elk-1 site plus 
putative ie86 protein binding sites decreased steady-state mrna levels
compared wild type early times infection. electrophoretic
mobility shift assays antibody supershifts detected binding cellular

with mock-infected nuclear extracts. role cellular transcription factors
activated mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase pathway activating transcription early viral promoters is
discussed.
