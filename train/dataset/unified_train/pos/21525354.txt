nf-κb plays key role innate acquired immunity. activity regulated
through intricate signaling networks. persistent excessive activation nf-κb
induces diseases, autoimmune disorders malignant neoplasms. infection
by human cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causes fatal hematopoietic
malignancy termed adult cell leukemia (atl). htlv-1 viral oncoprotein tax
functions pivotally leukemogenesis potent activation nf-κb.
recent findings suggest protein ubiquitination crucial proper
regulation nf-κb signaling tax activity. here, report that
ubiquitin-specific peptidase usp20 deubiquitinates traf6 tax suppresses
interleukin 1β (il-1β)- tax-induced nf-κb activation. results point to
usp20 key negative regulator tax-induced nf-κb signaling.
