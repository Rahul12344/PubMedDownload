rotavirus important cause viral gastroenteritis dehydrating
diarrhea young children. rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) an
enterotoxin identified important agent symptomatic rotavirus
infection. identify cellular proteins interact nsp4, two-hybrid
technique saccharomyces cerevisiae used. nsp4 cdna, derived the
human rotavirus strain wa, cloned yeast shuttle vector pgbkt7. an
intestinal cdna library derived caco-2 cells cloned yeast shuttle
vector pgad10 screened proteins interact nsp4. protein
interactions confirmed vivo coimmunoprecipitation and
immunohistochemical colocalization. two-hybrid library screening, we
repeatedly isolated cdnas encoding extracellular matrix (ecm) protein
laminin-beta3 (amino acids [aa] 274 878) cdna encoding ecm protein
fibronectin (aa 1755 1884). using deletion mutants nsp4, mapped the
region interaction ecm proteins aa 87 145. deletion
analysis laminin-beta3 indicated region comprising aa 726 875 of
laminin-beta3 interacts nsp4. interaction nsp4 either laminin-beta3 
or fibronectin confirmed coimmunoprecipitation. nsp4 present in
infected enterocytes basement membrane (bm) infected neonatal mice 
and colocalized laminin-beta3, indicating physiological interaction. in
conclusion, two-hybrid screening nsp4 yielded two potential target proteins,
laminin-beta3 fibronectin, interacting enterotoxin nsp4. release
of nsp4 basal side infected epithelial cells subsequent
binding ecm proteins localized bm may signify new mechanism 
rotavirus disease established.
