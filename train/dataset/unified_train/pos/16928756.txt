the infectious cycle human polyomavirus jc (jcv) ultimately regulated
in cellular nuclei level viral protein expression genomic
replication. activity prompted interactions variant nucleotide
sequences within jcv regulatory region (promoter) cellular transcription 
factors bind specific dna consensus sites. previous work identified an
nf-1 class member, nf-1x, critical transcription factor affecting jcv
cellular host range. within variant jcv promoters, well viral and
cellular promoters, adjacently located nf-1 ap-1 consensus sites often
found. close proximity two binding sites suggests opportunity
for interaction nf-1 ap-1 proteins. here, electrophoretic mobility
shift assays, show temporal dose-dependent interference ap-1 family 
member, c-jun, upon nf-1 proteins binding nf-1 consensus site derived jcv
promoter sequence. moreover, demonstrated protein-protein interaction
assays, identify specific binding affinity independent dna binding 
nf-1x c-jun. finally, compare binding profiles nf-1x c-jun on
jcv promoter sequence parallel vivo detection viral activity
levels, developed anchored transcriptional promoter (atp) assay. use
of extracts jcv-infected cells transfected overexpress either nf-1x or
c-jun, atp assays showed concurrent increases nf-1x binding viral protein 
expression. conversely, increased c-jun binding accompanied decreases both
nf-1x binding viral protein expression. therefore, inhibition nf-1x
binding c-jun appears play role regulating levels jcv activity.
