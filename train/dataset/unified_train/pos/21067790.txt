walleye dermal sarcoma virus encodes retroviral cyclin (rv-cyclin) a
cyclin box fold transcription activation domain (ad). co-immune precipitation
(co-ip) identified association rv-cyclin cyclin-dependent kinase 8
(cdk8). cdk8 dependent upon cyclin c regulates transcription the
mediator complex, co-activator transcription. mutation cyclin residues,
required cdk binding, disrupts rv-cyclin-cdk8 co-ip. mutation removal of
the ad effect cdk8 interaction. direct rv-cyclin-cdk8 binding is
demonstrated pulldown active cdk8 gst-rv-cyclin binding to
recombinant cdk8. cdk3 also activated cyclin c phosphorylates
retinoblastoma protein initiate entry cell division cycle. co-ip 
pulldowns demonstrate direct rv-cyclin binding cdk3 well. rv-cyclin
functions structural ortholog cyclin c spite limited amino acid
sequence identity c cyclins known cyclins.
