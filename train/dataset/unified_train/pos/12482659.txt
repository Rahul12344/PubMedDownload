two structural proteins form papillomavirus (pv) capsids. functions
of major structural protein l1 well established, exact functions 
the minor structural protein l2 much less well defined, except some
information role viral entry maturation infectious virions. to
gain insight function l2 used yeast two hybrid system 
the human papillomavirus (hpv) 11 l2 hpv16 l2 bait proteins isolate
putative cellular interaction partners. identified four proteins interacting
with l2 proteins least two different hpv types interaction was
confirmed vitro pull-down assays. evidence interaction was
obtained vivo localization studies. two proteins, previously
described patz novel protein, designated plinp, localized discrete 
nuclear domains colocalized l2. third protein, designated pmsp, a
newly identified cytoplasmic protein recruited nuclear dots when
coexpressed l2. fourth protein interacting hpv16, 11 1 l2, 
tubular-nephritis antigen related protein (tin-ag-rp), shows cytoplasmic as
well membrane bound subcellular distribution. taken together, data
indicate l2 hpvs different phenotypes interacts several
cellular host proteins, recruits one nucleus, complexed
with least three cellular proteins specific nuclear domains. findings
suggest hpv type-independent modulatory function l2 host-cell functions 
that involves discrete nuclear domains alteration subcellular
distribution cellular proteins. interacting cellular proteins identified
may play role viral life cycle establishment viral persistence.
