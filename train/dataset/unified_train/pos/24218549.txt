the e3 transcription unit human adenoviruses (ads) encodes immunomodulatory
proteins. interestingly, size composition e3 region differs
considerably among ad species, suggesting distinct sets immunomodulatory 
e3 proteins may influence interaction human host disease
pattern. however, date, common immune evasion functions species c e3
proteins described. report immunomodulatory activity 
a species d-specific e3 protein, e3/49k. unlike e3 proteins act on
infected cells, e3/49k seems target uninfected cells. initially synthesized as
an 80- 100-kda type transmembrane protein, e3/49k subsequently cleaved,
with large ectodomain (sec49k) secreted. found purified sec49k
exhibits specific binding lymphoid cell lines primary leukocytes, 
not fibroblasts epithelial cells. consistent binding profile 
the molecular mass, sec49k receptor identified cell surface
protein tyrosine phosphatase cd45. antibody-blocking studies suggested that
sec49k binds membrane proximal domains present cd45 isoforms.
functional studies showed sec49k suppress activation and
cytotoxicity natural killer cells well activation, signaling, and
cytokine production cells. thus, discovered adenovirus protein
that actively secreted describe immunomodulatory activities e3
protein uniquely expressed single ad species.
