using c-terminal domain (pct) measles virus (mv) phosphoprotein (p
protein) bait yeast two-hybrid screen, cdna identical recently
described human p53-induced-ring-h2 (hpirh2) cdna isolated. glutathione
s-transferase-hpirh2 fusion protein expressed bacteria able pull p
protein mixed extract p-expressing hela cells vitro, and
myc-tagged hpirh2 could reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated mv p protein
from human cells. additionally, immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that
hpirh2-myc, mv p, nucleocapsid (n) proteins form ternary complex. the
hpirh2 binding site mapped c-terminal x domain region p protein
by using yeast two-hybrid assay. pct binding site mapped hpirh2 by
using novel yeast two-hybrid tagged pcr approach co-immunoprecipitation 
of hpirh2 cysteine mutants mouse/human pirh2 chimeras. hpirh2 c terminus 
could mediate interaction mv p favored ring-h2 motif.
when coexpressed enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged hpirh2
protein, mv p alone complex mv n able redistribute hpirh2 
outside nucleus, within intracellular aggregates. finally, mv p efficiently
stabilized hpirh2-myc expression prevented ubiquitination vivo had
no effect stability ubiquitination alternative ubiquitin e3
ligase, mdm2. thus, mv p protein first protein pathogen is
able specifically interact stabilize ubiquitin e3 ligase hpirh2
by preventing ubiquitination.
