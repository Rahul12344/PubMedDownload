expression viral proteins causes important epigenetic changes leading to
abnormal cell growth. whether viral proteins directly target histone
methyltransferases (hmts), key family enzyme epigenetic regulation, and
modulate enzymatic activities remains elusive. show e6
proteins low-risk high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) interact 
three coactivator hmts, carm1, prmt1 set7, downregulate enzymatic
activities vitro hpv-transformed hela cells. furthermore, three
hmts required e6 attenuate p53 transactivation function.
mechanistically, e6 hampers carm1- prmt1-catalyzed histone methylation at
p53-responsive promoters, suppresses binding p53 chromatinized dna 
independently e6-mediated p53 degradation. p53 pre-methylated lysine-372
(p53k372 mono-methylation) set7 protects p53 e6-induced degradation.
consistently, e6 downregulates p53k372 mono-methylation thus reduces p53
protein stability. result e6-mediated inhibition hmt activity,
expression p53 downstream genes suppressed. together, results 
reveal clever approach virus interfere p53 function, also
demonstrate modulation hmt activity novel mechanism epigenetic
