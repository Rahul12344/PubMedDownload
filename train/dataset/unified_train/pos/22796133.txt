the flavivirus genus includes important human neurotropic pathogens like
tick-borne encephalitis virus (tbev) west-nile virus (wnv). flavivirus
replication occurs replication complexes, ns5 protein provides 
rna cap methyltransferase rna-dependent rna polymerase activities. tbevns5
contains two pdz binding motifs (pbms) important specific targeting human 
pdz proteins including scribble, association important viral down
regulation cellular defense systems neurite outgrowth. determine
whether pbms tbevns5 affects virus replication constructed dna based 
sub-genomic tbev replicon expressing firefly luciferase. pbms within ns5 were
mutated individually concert replicons assayed cell
culture. results show replication rate impaired mutants, 
which indicates pdz dependent host interactions influence tbev replication. 
we also find c-terminal pbms present tbevns5 wnvns5 targeting
various human pdz domain proteins. tbevns5 affinity zonula occludens-2
(zo-2), giap c-terminus interacting protein (gipc), calcium/calmodulin-dependent 
serine protein kinase (cask), glutamate receptor interacting protein 2, (grip2)
and interleukin 16 (il-16). different pattern observed wnvns5 it
associate broader repertoire putative host pdz proteins.
