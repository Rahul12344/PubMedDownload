circoviruses represent rapidly increasing genus viruses infect a
variety vertebrates. replication requires shuttling viral molecules the
host cell nucleus, process facilitated capsid-associated protein (cap).
whilst nuclear localization signal (nls) shown mediate nuclear
translocation, mode nuclear transport remains elucidated. better 
understand process, beak feather disease virus (bfdv) cap nls was
crystallized nuclear import receptor importin-α (impα). diffraction yielded 
structural data 2.9å resolution, binding site impα bfdv
cap nls well resolved. binding mechanism major site likely
conserved across circoviruses supported similarity nlss in
circovirus caps. finding illuminates crucial step infection host
cells viral family, provides platform rational drug design
against binding interface.
