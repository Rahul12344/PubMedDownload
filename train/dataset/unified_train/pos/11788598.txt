hepatitis b virus (hbv) gene expression mainly regulated transcription 
initiation level. viral x protein (px) transcription
coactivator/mediator targeting tfiib recruitment rna polymerase ii.
here report novel px nuclear target designated hbxap (hepatitis b virus
x-associated protein). hbxap novel cellular nuclear protein containing phd
(plant homology domain) finger, domain shared many proteins play roles 
in chromatin remodeling, transcription coactivation, oncogenesis. px
physically interacts hbxap vitro vivo via hbxap region
containing phd finger. functional level hbxap increases hbv
transcription px-dependent manner suggesting role interaction 
the virus life cycle. interestingly, hbxap collaborates px coactivating
the transcriptional activator nf-kappab. coactivation nf-kappab also
observed tumor necrosis factor alpha-treated cells suggesting px-hbxap
functional collaboration localized downstream nf-kappab nuclear import.
collectively data suggest px recruits potentiates novel putative
transcription coactivator regulate nf-kappab. implication px-hbxap
interaction development hepatocellular carcinoma discussed.
