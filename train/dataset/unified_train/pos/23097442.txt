stress granules (sgs) cytoplasmic foci composed stalled translation
preinitiation complexes induced environmental stress stimuli, including viral 
infection. since viral propagation completely depends host translational
machinery, many viruses evolved circumvent induction sgs co-opt
sg components. study, found expression japanese encephalitis
virus (jev) core protein inhibits sg formation. caprin-1 identified a
binding partner core protein affinity capture mass spectrometry
analysis. alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed lys(97) arg(98) the
Î±-helix jev core protein play crucial role interaction with
caprin-1. cells infected mutant jev lys(97) arg(98) were
replaced alanines core protein, inhibition sg formation was
abrogated, viral propagation impaired. furthermore, mutant jev
exhibited attenuated virulence mice. results suggest jev core
protein circumvents translational shutoff inhibiting sg formation an
interaction caprin-1 facilitates viral propagation vitro vivo.
