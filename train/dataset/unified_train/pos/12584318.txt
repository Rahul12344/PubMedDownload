a widely dispersed interference group retroviruses includes feline
endogenous virus (rd114), baboon endogenous virus (baev), human endogenous virus 
type w (herv-w), type primate retroviruses uses human na(+)-dependent
neutral amino acid transporter type 2 (hasct2; gene name, slc1a5) common
cell surface receptor. although hamster cells fully resistant these
viruses murine cells susceptible baev herv-w pseudotype
viruses, rodent cells become highly susceptible viruses 
after treatment tunicamycin, inhibitor protein n-linked glycosylation.
a partial explanation results recently provided findings that
the orthologous murine transporter masct2 inactive viral receptor, a
related (ca. 55% identity) murine paralog (masct1; gene name, slc1a4) mediates
infections specifically baev herv-w, n-deglycosylation masct1 
activates receptor viruses interference group. because
the two n-linked oligosaccharides masct1 occur carboxyl-terminal
region extracellular loop 2 (ecl2), inferred region
contributes inhibitory manner infections rd114 type primate
viruses. directly thoroughly investigate receptor active sites,
we constructed analyzed series hasct2/masct2 chimeras site-directed 
mutants. results suggest hypervariable sequence 21 amino acids in
the carboxyl-terminal portion ecl2 plays critical role determining the
receptor properties asct2 proteins viruses interference group.
in addition, analyzed tunicamycin-dependent viral susceptibility of
hamster cells. contrast masct1, contains two n-linked
oligosaccharides partially restrict viral infections, hamster asct1 contains
an additional n-linked oligosaccharide clustered close others the
carboxyl-terminal region ecl2. removal n-linked oligosaccharide by
mutagenesis enabled hamster asct1 function receptor viruses of
this interference group. results strongly suggest combinations of
amino acid sequence changes n-linked oligosaccharides critical
carboxyl-terminal region ecl2 control retroviral utilization asct1
and asct2 receptors.
