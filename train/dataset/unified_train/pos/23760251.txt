wild-type measles virus (mv) strains use signaling lymphocytic activation
molecule (slam; cd150) adherens junction protein nectin-4 (poliovirus
receptor-like 4 [pvrl4]) receptors. vaccine mv strains adapted use
ubiquitous membrane cofactor protein (mcp; cd46) addition. recently solved
cocrystal structures mv attachment protein (hemagglutinin [h]) each
receptor indicate three bind close hydrophobic groove located
between blades 4 5 (β4-β5 groove) h protein β-propeller head. used 
this structural information focus analysis functional footprints of
the three receptors vaccine mv h. mutagenized protein tested the
ability individual mutants support cell fusion receptor. the
results highlighted strong overlap functional footprints of
nectin-4 cd46 slam. soluble form nectin-4 abolished
vaccine mv entry nectin-4- cd46-expressing cells reduced entry
through slam. analyses binding kinetics h mutant three
receptors revealed single substitution β4-β5 groove drastically
reduced nectin-4 cd46 binding minimally altering slam binding. also 
generated recombinant viruses analyzed infections cells expressing
individual receptors. introduction single substitution hydrophobic 
pocket affected entry nectin-4 cd46 slam. thus, 
while nectin-4 cd46 interact functionally h protein β4-β5
hydrophobic groove, slam merely covers it. implications vaccine 
antiviral strategies.
