hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein shown interact death
domain (dd) tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (tnfr1). study, we
further examined interaction core protein signaling molecules
of tnfr1, including fadd, tradd, traf2, human embryonic kidney cell
line, hek-293, overexpresses hcv core protein. core
protein-expressing cell line exhibited enhanced sensitivity tnf-induced
apoptosis. vitro binding vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays, we
showed hcv core protein interacted dd fadd enhanced
apoptosis induced fadd overexpression. enhancement could blocked 
dominant-negative mutant fadd. contrast, core protein directly 
interact dd tradd, could disrupt binding tradd tnfr1.
traf2 recruitment tnfr1 signaling complex also disrupted core
protein. correspondingly, traf2-dependent activation protein kinase jnk
was suppressed core protein-expressing cells. however, nf kappa b
activation tnf significantly altered hcv core protein,
suggesting existence traf2-independent pathways nf kappa b activation.
these results combined indicate hcv core protein sensitizes cells to
tnf-induced apoptosis primarily facilitating fadd recruitment tnfr1. the
inhibition jnk activation hcv core protein may also contribute the
increased propensity cells apoptosis. results, comparison with
other published studies, suggest effects hcv core protein and
their underlying mechanisms vary significantly among cells different origins.
