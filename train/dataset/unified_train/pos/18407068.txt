human cytomegalovirus proteins alter host cells favor virus replication. these
viral proteins include pul38, prevents apoptosis. characterize mode 
of action pul38, modified viral genome encode epitope-tagged
pul38 used rapid immunoaffinity purification isolate pul38-interacting
host proteins, identified mass spectrometry. one the
cellular proteins identified tsc2, constituent tuberous sclerosis
tumor suppressor protein complex (tsc1/2). tsc1/2 integrates stress signals and
regulates mammalian target rapamycin complex 1 (mtorc1), protein complex
that responds stress limiting protein synthesis cell growth. showed 
that pul38 interacts tsc1 tsc2 cells infected wild-type
cytomegalovirus. furthermore, tsc1/2 failed regulate mtorc1 cells
expressing pul38, cells exhibited enlarged size characteristic of
cytomegalovirus infection. thus, pul38 supports virus replication least in
part blocking cellular responses stress.
