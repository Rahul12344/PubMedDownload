herpesviral infection endothelial cells (ecs) induces arterial injury. 
demonstrate infection promoted enhanced monocyte-endothelial adhesion. 
enhanced adhesion blocked monoclonal antibodies viral-encoded cell 
surface glycoprotein gc antibodies gd ge. adhesion also
blocked treating ecs specific thrombin inhibitors growing cells 
prothrombin-depleted serum. found gc bound promoted activation of
factor x infected ecs, thereby contributing thrombin generation. factor x
also bound transfected l cells induced express gc. cross-linking 
and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated factor x-gc complex formation the
surface cells. suggest gc-dependent thrombin generation by
herpes-infected endothelium may important mediator vascular pathology
during viral infection.
