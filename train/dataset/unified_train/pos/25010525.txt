kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) etiological agent of
kaposi's sarcoma (ks), malignancy commonly found aids patients. whether ks
is true neoplasm hyperplasia subject intensive debate until
recently kshv unequivocally shown efficiently infect, immortalize 
transform rat primary mesenchymal precursor cells (mm). moreover,
kshv-transformed mm cells (kmm) efficiently induce tumors hallmark features 
of ks inoculated nude mice. here, showed smad1 novel binding
protein kshv latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana). lana interacted with
and sustained bmp-activated p-smad1 nucleus enhanced loading on
the id promoters. result, ids significantly up-regulated kmm cells
and abundantly expressed human ks lesions. strikingly, genetic chemical
inhibition bmp-smad1-id pathway blocked oncogenic phenotype of
kshv-transformed cells vitro vivo. findings illustrate novel
mechanism tumor virus hijacks converts developmental pathway
into indispensable oncogenic pathway tumorigenesis. importantly, our
results demonstrate efficacy targeting bmp-smad1-id pathway for
inhibiting growth kshv-induced tumors, therefore identify bmp
pathway promising therapeutic target ks.
