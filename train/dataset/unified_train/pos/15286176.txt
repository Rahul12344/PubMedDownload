human homologue drosophila dlg tumor suppressor (hdlg) widely
expressed scaffold protein implicated organization multi-protein
complexes cell adhesion sites neuronal synapse. hdlg contains
three pdz domains mediate binding consensus motifs present the
c-termini various cell surface proteins, thus inducing clustering and/or
stabilization plasma membrane. using yeast two-hybrid screen, we
identified hdlg cellular binding partner viral membrane integral
protein, envelope glycoprotein (env) human t-cell leukemia virus type 1
(htlv-1). htlv-1 human retrovirus infects cd4+ lymphocytes is
preferentially transmitted via direct contacts infected target cells,
through structure referred virological synapse. here, demonstrate 
that hdlg interacts classical pdz domain-binding motif present the
c-terminus cytoplasmic domain htlv-1 env conserved related
htlv-2 virus. document that, htlv-1 infected primary cells, hdlg 
and env concentrated restricted areas plasma membrane, enriched 
molecules involved t-cell contacts. presence gag proteins responsible
for viral assembly budding areas indicated constitute
platforms viral assembly transmission. finally, mutant virus unable 
bind hdlg exhibited decreased ability trigger env mediated cell fusion
between lymphocytes. thus propose hdlg stabilizes htlv-1 envelope
glycoproteins virological synapse formed infected target
cells, hence assisting cell-to-cell transmission virus.
