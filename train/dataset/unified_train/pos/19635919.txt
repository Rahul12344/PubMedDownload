dengue virus (dv) west nile virus (wnv) become global concern due to
their widespread distribution ability cause variety human
diseases. antiviral immune defenses involve nk cells. present study, we
investigated interaction nk cells two flaviviruses. show
that nk-activating receptor nkp44 involved virally mediated nk
activation direct interaction flavivirus envelope protein.
recombinant nkp44 directly binds purified dv wnv envelope proteins and
specifically domain iii wnv envelope protein; also binds wnv
virus-like particles. wnv-virus-like particles wnv-domain iii wnv
envelope protein directly bind nk cells expressing high levels nkp44.
functionally, interaction nk cells infective inactivated wnv results 
in nkp44-mediated nk degranulation. finally, wnv infection cells results in
increased binding rnkp44 specifically inhibited anti-wnv serum.
wnv-infected target cells induce ifn-gamma secretion augmented lysis by
nkp44-expressing primary nk cells blocked anti-nkp44 abs. our
findings show triggering nk cells flavivirus mediated by
interaction nkp44 flavivirus envelope protein.
