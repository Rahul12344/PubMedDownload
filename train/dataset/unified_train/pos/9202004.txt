the hepatitis b viral x promoter known positively autoregulated its
own hbx protein, also interacts many cellular regulatory proteins. 
investigated effect activating transcription factor 2 (atf2) the
activity x promoter. cotransfection atf2 expression vector x
promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid repressed x promoter
activity hepg2 cells. hbx activated activating protein 1 (ap-1)-mediated
transcription hepatitis b virus e element 35-fold, its
activation activity inhibited presence atf2, suggesting atf2
inhibited autoactivation x promoter hbx basal transcription
mediated ap-1. since binding sites ap-1 atf2 hepatitis b
virus e element overlap, repression x promoter activity atf2 exerted
by competition ap-1 binding site formation atf2-jun
heterodimer case consensus ap-1 element. however, small x
promoter atf2 binding site activated atf2. results suggest
that syntheses x proteins differentially regulated atf2.
