hepatitis b virus (hbv) eni enhancer activate expression hbv and
non-hbv genes liver-specific manner. performing electrophoretic
mobility-shift assays, demonstrated three related, liver-enriched,
transcription factors, hnf3 alpha, hnf3 beta, hnf3 gamma could bind to
the 2c site hbv eni enhancer. mutations introduced 2c site abolish
the binding hnf3 reduced enhancer activity approximately 15-fold.
moreover, expression hnf3 antisense sequences suppress expression of
hnf3 huh-7 hepatoma cells led reduction eni enhancer activity. these
results indicate hnf3 positively regulates eni enhancer activity and
this regulation likely mediated 2c site. requirement of
hnf3 eni enhancer activity could explain liver specificity this
enhancer element.
