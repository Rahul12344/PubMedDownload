the role surfactant protein (sp)-a cytomegalovirus (cmv) infection the
lung investigated. found sp-a binds various immobilized human cmv 
proteins exposed surface infected embryonal lung fibroblasts.
the interaction sp-a immobilized cmv proteins found be
calcium-dependent inhibited mannan, suggesting involvement the
carbohydrate recognition domain sp-a high-mannose carbohydrate residues of
viral envelope glycoproteins. using flow cytometry confocal laser
fluorescence microscopy rat model showed preincubation rat cmv 
with sp-a stimulates binding internalization rat type ii pneumocytes
and alveolar tissue macrophages. effect concentration- and
ca(2+)-dependent inhibited mannan. therefore, domains sp-a 
involved sp-a cmv interaction interaction sp-a/virus complex
with rat lung cells distinct. additionally, human cmv model, sheep 
well human proteinosis sp-a significantly affect human cmv replication
in embryonal lung fibroblasts. thus, sp-a may contribute cmv-associated
pathology lung increasing efficiency target cell infection.
