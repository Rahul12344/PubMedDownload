the human protein bax sits critical regulatory junction apoptosis, or
programmed cell death. bax exists equilibrium cytosolic and
mitochondria-associated forms shifts toward latter bax activated
by proapoptotic proteins. activated bax changes conformation, inserts the
mitochondrial outer membrane (mom), oligomerizes, induces mom
permeabilization, causing release cytochrome c, effectively commits 
the cell die. apoptosis also basic defense mechanism against
invading pathogens, many viruses developed counteractive measures. is
the case human cytomegalovirus, replication hinges vmia (viral
mitochondria-localized inhibitor apoptosis), virus-encoded protein a
unique, albeit poorly understood antiapoptotic activity binds and
recruits bax mitochondria. show, via structure determination of
the complex bax peptide comprising vmia's bax-binding domain, 
vmia contacts bax previously unknown regulatory site. notably, using
full-length vmia, structure independently confirmed assays human
cells measure bax subcellular localization cytochrome c release. mutants
that disrupt key intermolecular interactions disfavor vmia's mitochondrial
recruitment bax, increase cytochrome c release upon apoptosis induction.
in stringent test, engineered binding interface achieves
wild-type-like charge complementarity, although reversed fashion, recovers
wild-type behavior. structure suggests stabilizing key elements in
bax needed unravel mom insertion oligomerization, vmia prevents
these important steps apoptosis.
