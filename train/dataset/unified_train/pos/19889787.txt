rift valley fever virus (rvfv) emerging, highly pathogenic virus; rvfv
infection lead encephalitis, retinitis, fatal hepatitis associated with
hemorrhagic fever humans, well death, abortions, fetal deformities
in animals. rvfv nonstructural nss protein, major factor virulence,
forms filamentous structures nuclei infected cells. order further
understand rvfv pathology, investigated, chromatin immunoprecipitation,
immunofluorescence, fluorescence situ hybridization, confocal microscopy, 
the capacity nss interact host genome. results demonstrate
that even though cellular dna predominantly excluded nss filaments, nss
interacts specific dna regions host genome clusters of
pericentromeric gamma-satellite sequence. targeting sequences nss was
correlated induction chromosome cohesion segregation defects in
rvfv-infected murine, well sheep cells. using recombinant nonpathogenic
virus rzhdeltanss210-230, expressing nss protein deleted region of
interaction cellular factor sap30, showed nss-sap30 interaction 
was essential nss target pericentromeric sequences, well for
induction chromosome segregation defects. effect rvfv upon the
inheritance genetic information discussed respect pathology
associated fetal deformities abortions, highlighting main role
played cellular cofactor sap30 establishment nss interactions with
host dna sequences rvfv pathogenesis.
