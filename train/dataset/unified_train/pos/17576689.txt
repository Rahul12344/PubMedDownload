basal transcription hiv ltr highly repressed requires tat to
recruit positive transcription elongation factor, p-tefb, functions 
promote transition rna polymerase ii abortive productive
elongation. p-tefb found two forms cells, free, active form a
large, inactive complex also contains 7sk rna hexim1 hexim2. 
show hiv infection cells led release p-tefb large
form. consistent tat cause effect, transfection a
flag-tagged tat 293t cells caused dramatic shift p-tefb large 
form smaller form containing tat. vitro, tat competed hexim1 for
binding 7sk, blocked formation p-tefb-hexim1-7sk complex, and
caused release p-tefb pre-formed p-tefb-hexim1-7sk complex. these
findings indicate tat acquire p-tefb large form. addition,
we found hexim1 binds tightly hiv 5' utr containing tar recruits 
and inhibits p-tefb activity. suggests absence tat, hexim1
may bind tar repress transcription elongation hiv ltr.
