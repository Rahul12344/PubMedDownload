the bcl-2 family regulates induction apoptosis mitochondria. essential 
to regulation interactions bcl-2 family members, are
mediated bcl-2 homology (bh) domains. vaccinia virus f1l unique inhibitor
of apoptosis lacks significant sequence similarity bcl-2 family and
does contain obvious bh domains. despite this, f1l inhibits cytochrome c
release mitochondria preventing bak bax activation. although f1l
constitutively interacts bak prevent bak activation, precise
mechanism interaction remains elusive. identified highly
divergent bh domains f1l verified recent crystal structure of
f1l (kvansakul, m., yang, h., fairlie, w. d., czabotar, p. e., fischer, s. f.,
perugini, m. a., huang, d. c., colman, p. m. (2008) cell death differ. 15,
1564-1571). show f1l required bh domains interact with
ectopically expressed endogenous bak. interaction f1l bak was
conserved across species, f1l cellular antiapoptotic protein
mcl-1 required bak bh3 domain interaction. moreover, f1l replaced mcl-1
during infection, bak x mcl-1 complex disrupted vaccinia virus 
infection. contrast uv irradiation, vaccinia virus infection result
in rapid degradation mcl-1, consistent observation vaccinia
virus initiate dna damage response. additionally, mcl-1 expression
prevented bak activation apoptosis infection proapoptotic
vaccinia virus devoid f1l. data suggest f1l replaces the
antiapoptotic activity mcl-1 vaccinia virus infection interacting
with bak using highly divergent bh domains.
