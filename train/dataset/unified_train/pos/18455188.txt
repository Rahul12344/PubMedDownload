epstein-barr virus (ebv) expresses immediate-early protein rta activate
the transcription ebv lytic genes lytic cycle. show ranbpm
acts binding partner rta yeast two-hybrid analysis. binding was
confirmed glutathione-s-transferase pull-down assay. coimmunoprecipitation
experiment confocal microscopy revealed ranbpm rta interact vivo 
and colocalize nucleus. interaction appears involve spry domain
in ranbpm region amino acid residues 416 476 rta. the
interaction promotes transactivation activity rta activating the
transcription bmlf1 p21 transient transfection assays. additionally,
ranbpm interacts sumo-e2 (ubc9) promote sumoylation rta sumo-1.
this fact explains expression ranbpm enhances transactivation
activity rta. taken together, present results indicate new role of
ranbpm regulating viral protein critical ebv lytic activation.
