translation mrnas suppressed stress conditions. phosphorylation 
of α-subunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eif2), which
delivers initiator trna (met-trna(i)) p site 40s ribosomal subunit,
is responsible translational suppression. however, translation of
hepatitis c viral (hcv) mrna refractory inhibitory effects eif2α
phosphorylation, prevents translation disrupting formation the
eif2-gtp-met-trna(i) ternary complex. here, report eif2a, alternative 
initiator trna-binding protein, key role translation hcv mrna
during hcv infection, turn promoting eif2α phosphorylation activating the
eif2α kinase pkr. direct interaction eif2a iiid domain hcv
internal ribosome entry site (ires) required eif2a-dependent translation. 
these data indicate stress-independent translation hcv mrna occurs by
recruitment eif2a hcv ires via direct interaction iiid domain 
and subsequent loading met-trna(i) p site 40s ribosomal subunit.
