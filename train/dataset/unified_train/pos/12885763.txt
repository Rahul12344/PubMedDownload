although human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) generally thought to
assemble plasma membrane infected cells, virions observed 
intracellular compartments macrophages. here, investigated virus assembly
in hiv-1-infected primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm). electron
microscopy cryosections showed virus particles, identified morphology
and positive labeling antibodies viral p17, p24, envelope
proteins, intracellular vacuoles. immunolabeling demonstrated these
compartments contained late endosomal marker cd63, enriched on
vesicles within structures incorporated envelope budding
virions. virus-containing vacuoles also labeled antibodies 
lamp-1, cd81, cd82, also incorporated viral envelope. 
assess cellular source infectious viruses derived mdm,
virus-containing media infected cells precipitated specific
antibodies. antibodies antigens found late endosomes precipitated
infectious virus, whereas antibodies proteins located primarily the
cell surface not. data indicate infectious hiv produced 
by primary macrophages assembled late endocytic membranes acquires
antigens characteristic compartment. notion significant
implications understanding biology hiv cell-cell transmission.
