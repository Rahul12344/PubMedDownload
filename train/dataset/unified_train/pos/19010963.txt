an internal ribosomal entry site (ires) directs initiation viral
protein translation potential drug target enterovirus 71 (ev71).
regulation internal initiation requires interaction ires trans-acting
factors (itafs) internal ribosomal entry site. biotinylated rna-affinity
chromatography proteomic approaches employed identify far upstream
element (fuse) binding protein 2 (fbp2) itaf ev71. interactions 
fbp2 ev71 ires confirmed competition assay mapping the
association sites viral ires fbp2 protein. ev71 infection,
fbp2 enriched cytoplasm viral replication occurs, whereas fbp2 was
localized nucleus mock-infected cells. synthesis viral proteins 
increased fbp2-knockdown cells infected ev71. ires activity in
fbp2-knockdown cells exceeded negative control (nc) sirna-treated
cells. hand, ires activity decreased fbp2 over-expressed in
the cells. results study suggest fbp2 novel itaf interacts
with ev71 ires negatively regulates viral translation.
