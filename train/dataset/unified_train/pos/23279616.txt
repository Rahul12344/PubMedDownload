human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) etiological agent adult
t-cell leukemia (atl). htlv-1 encodes oncoprotein tax1, essential
for immortalization human t-cells persistent htlv-1 infection vivo.
tax1 pdz binding motif (pbm) c-terminus. motif crucial for
the transforming activity tax1 t-cell line persistent htlv-1
infection. tax1 pbm interacts pdz domain proteins dlg1
and scribble, determined yet, cellular pdz proteins
mediate functions tax1 pbm. demonstrate tax1 interacts with
the pdz domain protein magi-1 pbm-dependent manner, interaction
mislocalizes magi-1 detergent-soluble detergent-insoluble
cellular fraction 293t cells htlv-1-infected t-cells. addition,
tax1-transformation t-cell line interleukin (il)-2-dependent to
il-2-independent growth selects cells irreversibly reduced expression of
magi-1 mrna level. findings imply tax1, like viral
oncoproteins, targets magi-1 mechanism suppress anti-tumor functions 
in htlv-1-infected cells contribute transforming activity t-cells
and persistent htlv-1 infection.
