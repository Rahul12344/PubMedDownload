viral immune evasion strategies target key aspects host antiviral
response. recently, recognized toll-like receptors (tlrs) a
role innate defense viruses. here, define function the
vaccinia virus (vv) protein a46r show inhibits intracellular signalling by
a range tlrs. tlr signalling triggered homotypic interactions between
the toll-like-interleukin-1 resistance (tir) domains receptors adaptor
molecules. a46r contains tir domain viral tir domain-containing
protein identified date. demonstrate a46r targets host tir
adaptors myeloid differentiation factor 88 (myd88), myd88 adaptor-like, tir
domain-containing adaptor inducing ifn-beta (trif), trif-related adaptor 
molecule thereby interferes downstream activation mitogen-activated
protein kinases nuclear factor kappab. trif mediates activation interferon
(ifn) regulatory factor 3 (irf3) induction ifn-beta tlr3 tlr4 and
suppresses vv replication macrophages. here, a46r disrupted trif-induced irf3 
activation induction trif-dependent gene regulated activation,
normal cell expressed secreted. furthermore, show a46r is
functionally distinct another described vv tlr inhibitor, a52r. importantly,
vv lacking a46r gene attenuated murine intranasal model,
demonstrating importance a46r vv virulence.
