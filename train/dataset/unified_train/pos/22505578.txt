the epstein-barr virus (ebv) protein eb2 (also called mta, sm bmlf1), an
essential nuclear protein produced replicative cycle ebv. eb2 is
required efficient cytoplasmic accumulation viral mrnas derived from
intronless genes. eb2 rna-binding protein whose expression shown
to influence rna stability, splicing, nuclear export translation. using a
yeast two-hybrid screen, identified three sr proteins, sf2/asf, 9g8 and
srp20, cellular partners eb2. then, using sirna deplete cells of
specific sr proteins, found srp20 plays essential role the
processing several model mrnas: renilla luciferase reporter mrna, the
human β-globin cdna transcript two ebv late mrnas. four mrnas were
previously found highly dependent eb2 efficient cytoplasmic
accumulation. here, show srp20 depletion results increase the
accumulation mrnas, correlates absence additive effect 
of eb2, suggesting eb2 functions antagonizing srp20. moreover, using
rna-immunoprecipitation assays found eb2 enhances association of
srp20 β-globin transcript suggesting eb2 acts stabilizing
srp20's labile interactions rna.
