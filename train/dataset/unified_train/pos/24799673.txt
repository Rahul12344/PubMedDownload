to subvert host immunity, influenza virus (iav) induces early apoptosis in
innate immune cells disrupting mitochondria membrane potential via its
polymerase basic protein 1-frame 2 (pb1-f2) accessory protein. whether immune
cells mechanisms counteract pb1-f2-mediated apoptosis currently
unknown. herein, define host mitochondrial protein nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-like receptor (nlr)x1 binds viral protein pb1-f2,
preventing iav-induced macrophage apoptosis promoting macrophage
survival type ifn signaling. initially observed nlrx1-deficient
mice infected iav exhibited increased pulmonary viral replication, well
as enhanced inflammatory-associated pulmonary dysfunction morbidity. analysis
of lungs iav-infected mice revealed markedly enhanced leukocyte
recruitment impaired production type ifn nlrx1(-/-) mice. impaired
type ifn production enhanced viral replication recapitulated in
nlrx1(-/-) macrophages associated increased mitochondrial mediated
apoptosis. gain- loss-of-function strategies protein interaction,
we identified nlrx1 directly bound pb1-f2 mitochondria of
macrophages. using recombinant virus lacking pb1-f2, confirmed deletion
of pb1-f2 abrogated nlrx1-dependent macrophage type ifn production and
apoptosis. thus, results demonstrate nlrx1 acts mitochondrial
sentinel protecting macrophages pb1-f2-induced apoptosis preserving
their antiviral function. propose nlrx1 critical for
macrophage immunity iav infection sensing extent viral
replication maintaining protective balance antiviral immunity and
excessive inflammation within lungs.
