the nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a) hepatitis c virus (hcv) shown
to interact variety cellular proteins implicated regulation 
of cell growth, interferon resistance, cellular signaling pathways, but
the role ns5a hcv pathogenesis firmly established. 
characterize multifunctional protein, instigated studies the
subcellular localization ns5a hepatoma cell line. ns5a localized to
the perinuclear membrane structures, including endoplasmic reticulum (er) and
the golgi apparatus, immunofluorescence staining confocal microscopy. in
addition, also associated surface cytoplasmic globular
structures expressed alone part ns3-5b polyprotein. oil red o
staining revealed globular structures lipid droplets, the
hcv core protein also localized. association ns5a intracellular
membrane confirmed membrane flotation analysis. determine
whether ns5a interacts cellular lipid-binding protein, performed
yeast two-hybrid screening hepg2 human liver cdna libraries.
apolipoprotein a1 (apoa1), one protein components high-density
lipoprotein (hdl) particles, identified two independent screening
processes. interaction ns5a apoa1 confirmed vitro 
pull-down vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments. immunofluorescence
staining revealed significant colocalization ns5a apoa1 golgi
apparatus. results established association ns5a lipid droplets and
apoa1, suggesting ns5a, together core protein, may play role in
the pathogenesis derangement lipid metabolism, contributing liver
steatosis commonly observed hepatitis c.
