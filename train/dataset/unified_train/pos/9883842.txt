adeno-associated virus 2 (aav)-based vectors gained attention a
potentially useful alternative commonly used retroviral and
adenoviral vectors human gene therapy. although aav uses ubiquitously
expressed cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hspg) receptor, the
transduction efficiency aav vectors varies greatly different cells and
tissues vitro vivo. demonstrate cell surface expression of
hspg alone insufficient aav infection, aav also requires human
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (fgfr1) co-receptor successful viral
entry host cell. document cells express either hspg 
or fgfr1 fail bind aav and, consequently, resistant infection aav.
these non-permissive cells successfully transduced aav vectors after
stable transfections cdnas encoding murine hspg human fgfr1.
furthermore, aav infection permissive cells, known express fgfr1 and
the epidermal growth factor receptor, abrogated treatment cells with
basic fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor. the
identification fgfr1 co-receptor aav provide new insights 
only role life cycle aav, also optimal use aav
vectors human gene therapy.
