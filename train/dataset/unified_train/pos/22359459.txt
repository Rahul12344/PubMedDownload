overexpression squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 (scca1) hepatitis g2
(hepg2) chinese hamster ovary cells increase hepatitis b virus (hbv)
binding capacity interacting pres1 domain hbv surface antigen.
however, magnitude increase binding capacity higher several
orders former, indicating existence additional factor(s) produced
by hepg2 cells, facilitates hbv attachment. ferritin light chain (ftl) 
identified sole high hit candidate screening human liver cdna library
using bacterial two-hybrid system either pres scca1 bait.
subsequent vitro protein-protein interaction assays confirmed binding
activity ftl pres scca1, well formation triple
complex pres-ftl-scca1, narrowed binding sites ftl. vitro
overexpression ftl could enhance hbv attachment hepg2 and
chinese hamster ovary cells, already overexpressing scca1.
importantly, vivo co-expression human ftl scca1 mouse liver means
of tailvein hydrodynamic injection increased serum levels hbv surface antigen 
transiently 24 hours post challenge hbv-positive human sera, large
amount hbv core antigen-positive hepatocytes around blood vessels could be
identified immunohistochemical staining 48 hours post challenge. data
strongly suggest ftl scca1 may serve coreceptors hbv cellular
attachment virus entry hepatocytes.
