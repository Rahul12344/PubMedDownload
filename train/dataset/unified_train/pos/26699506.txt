various host factors involved cellular entry hepatitis c virus
(hcv). addition factors previously reported, discovered the
very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (vldlr) mediates hcv entry independent of
cd81. culturing huh7.5 cells hypoxic conditions significantly increased hcv
entry result expression vldlr, expressed under
normoxic conditions cell line. ectopic vldlr expression conferred
susceptibility hcv entry cd81-deficient huh7.5 cells. additionally,
vldlr-mediated hcv entry affected knockdown cellular factors
known act hcv receptors hcv entry factors. vldlr expressed in
primary human hepatocytes, results suggest vldlr functions vivo an
hcv receptor independent canonical cd81-mediated hcv entry.
