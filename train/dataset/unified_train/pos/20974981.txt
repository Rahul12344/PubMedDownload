hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection associated development of
hepatocellular carcinoma putatively also non-hodgkin's b cell lymphoma. in
this study, demonstrated pbmcs obtained hcv-infected patients showed
frequent chromosomal aberrations hcv infection b cells vitro
induced enhanced chromosomal breaks sister chromatid exchanges. hcv infection
hypersensitized cells ionizing radiation bleomycin inhibited
nonhomologous end-joining repair. viral core nonstructural protein 3
proteins shown responsible inhibition dna repair, mediated 
by reactive oxygen species. stable expression core protein induced
frequent chromosome translocations cultured cells transgenic mice. hcv 
core protein binds nbs1 protein inhibits formation the
mre11/nbs1/rad50 complex, thereby affecting atm activation inhibiting dna
binding repair enzymes. taken together, data indicate hcv infection
inhibits multiple dna repair processes potentiate chromosome instability in
both monocytes hepatocytes. effects may explain oncogenicity and
immunological perturbation hcv infection.
