the large antigens polyomaviruses target cellular proteins control
fundamental processes, including p53 rb family tumor suppressors.
mechanisms underlie t-antigen-induced cell transformation need fully
addressed, as-yet unidentified target proteins might involved the
process. addition, recently identified polyomaviruses associated with
particular human diseases aggressive skin cancers. here, report that
simian virus 40 (sv40) large antigen interacts transforming acidic
coiled-coil-containing protein tacc2, involved stabilizing
microtubules mitosis. antigen directly binds tacc2 induces microtubule
dysfunction, leading disorganized mitotic spindles, slow progression of
mitosis chromosome missegregation. mitotic defects caused by
n-terminal-deleted antigen, minimally interacts tacc2, whereas
t-antigen-induced microtubule destabilization suppressed overexpressing
tacc2. thus, tacc2 might key target antigen disrupt microtubule
regulation chromosomal inheritance initiation cell transformation.
