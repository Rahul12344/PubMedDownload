the activating protein 1 (ap-1) family regulatory proteins characterized as
immediate-early inducible transcription factors shown activated 
by variety stress-related stimuli involved numerous biological 
processes, including cellular viral gene expression, cell proliferation,
differentiation, tumorigenesis. recently demonstrated involvement
of ap-1 family members c-jun c-fos transcriptional regulation the
human polyomavirus, jc virus (jcv), genome. here, examined role 
in jcv gene regulation replication physical functional
interaction jcv early regulatory protein large antigen (t-ag).
transfection replication studies indicated c-jun c-fos can
significantly diminish t-ag-mediated jcv gene transcription replication.
affinity chromatography coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated c-jun 
and t-ag physically interact other. results band shift assays
showed binding efficiency c-jun ap-1 site reduced the
presence t-ag. addition, mapped, use series of
deletion mutants, regions proteins important their
interaction. c-jun interaction domain t-ag localized the
middle portion protein, t-ag interacting domain c-jun maps its
basic-dna binding region. results transient-transfection assays various
c-jun mutants t-ag expression constructs confirm specificity of
the functional interaction c-jun t-ag. taken together, data
demonstrate immediate-early inducible transcription factors c-jun c-fos 
physically functionally interact jcv major early regulatory protein
large t-ag interaction modulates jcv transcription replication 
in glial cells.
