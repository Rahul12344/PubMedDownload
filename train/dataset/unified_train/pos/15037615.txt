hepatitis e virus (hev), plus-stranded rna virus contains three open reading
frames. these, orf1 encodes viral nonstructural polyprotein; orf2 encodes 
the major capsid protein orf3 codes phosphoprotein undefined
function. using yeast two-hybrid system screen human cdna liver library 
we isolated, n-terminal deleted protein, alpha(1) -microglobulin/bikunin 
precursor (ambp) specifically interacts orf3 protein hev.
independently cloned, full-length ambp obtained tested positive for
interaction orf3 using variety vivo vitro techniques. ambp, a
liver-specific precursor protein codes two different unrelated proteins
alpha(1)-microglobulin (alpha(1)m) bikunin. alpha(1) individually
interacted orf3. findings validated cos-1 cell
immunoprecipitation, his(6) pull-down experiments, co-localization
experiments followed fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis. human
liver cells showing co-localization orf3 endogenously expressing alpha(1)
m showed distinct disappearance protein golgi compartment,
suggesting orf3 enhances secretion alpha(1)m hepatocyte.
using drugs block secretory pathway, showed alpha not
degraded presence orf3. finally, (1)pulse labeling alpha(1)m showed 
that secretion expedited liver cell faster rates the
presence orf3 protein. hence, orf3 direct biological role in
enhancing alpha(1)m export hepatocyte.
