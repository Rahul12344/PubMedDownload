the ns1 protein influenza virus major virulence factor is
essential pathogenesis. ns1 functions impair innate adaptive immunity 
by inhibiting host signal transduction gene expression, mechanisms of
action remain fully elucidated. show ns1 forms inhibitory
complex nxf1/tap, p15/nxt, rae1/mrnp41, e1b-ap5, key
constituents mrna export machinery interact mrnas and
nucleoporins direct mrnas nuclear pore complex. increased levels
of nxf1, p15, rae1 revert mrna export blockage induced ns1.
furthermore, influenza virus down-regulates nup98, nucleoporin a
docking site mrna export factors. reduced expression mrna export
factors renders cells highly permissive influenza virus replication,
demonstrating proper levels key constituents mrna export machinery
protect influenza virus replication. nup98 rae1 induced
by interferons, down-regulation pathway likely viral strategy to
promote viral replication. findings demonstrate previously undescribed
influenza-mediated viral-host interactions provide insights potential
molecular therapies may interfere influenza infection.
