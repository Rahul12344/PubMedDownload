hepatitis c virus (hcv) causes persistent infection, chronic hepatitis, and
leads hepatocellular carcinoma. nonstructural protein 3 (ns3) hcv possesses
protease, nucleoside triphosphatase, helicase activities. using yeast two
hybrid assay, identified sm-d1, host protein binds ns3. sm-d1 a
component small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snrnp) complexes are
associated autoimmune disease. sm-d1 gly-arg (gr) repeats c
terminus, contains dimethylarginine modified post-translational
modification may constitute immunoreactive determinant. deletion mutants
revealed c-terminal region sm-d1 containing gr repeats the
binding region ns3, expression feature sm-d1 affected by
co-expression ns3. immunostaining assay demonstrated ns3 also present
in nucleus cells overexpressing sm-d1, although usually found in
cytoplasm. localization ns3 could change following interaction sm-d1 
and affect function sm-d1.
