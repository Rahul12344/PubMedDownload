vaccinia virus (vacv) encodes many immunomodulatory proteins, including
inhibitors apoptosis modulators innate immune signalling. vacv protein 
n1 intracellular homodimer contributes virus virulence was
reported inhibit nuclear factor (nf)-kappab signalling. however, analysis of
nf-kappab signalling cells infected recombinant viruses without
the n1l gene showed difference nf-kappab-dependent gene expression. given
that n1 promotes virus virulence, possible functions n1 were
investigated revealed n1 inhibitor apoptosis cells
transfected n1l gene context vacv infection. support of
this finding virally expressed n1 co-precipitated endogenous pro-apoptotic
bcl-2 proteins bid, bad bax well bad bax expressed by
transfection. addition, crystal structure n1 solved 2.9 a
resolution (0.29 nm). remarkably, although n1 shows sequence similarity to
cellular proteins, three-dimensional structure closely resembles bcl-x(l) and
other members bcl-2 protein family. structure also reveals n1 has
a constitutively open surface groove similar grooves other
anti-apoptotic bcl-2 proteins, bind bh3 motifs pro-apoptotic bcl-2
family members. molecular modelling bh3 peptides n1 surface groove,
together analysis physico-chemical properties, suggests mechanism
for specificity peptide recognition. study illustrates importance
of evolutionary conservation structure, rather sequence, protein
function reveals novel anti-apoptotic protein orthopoxviruses.
