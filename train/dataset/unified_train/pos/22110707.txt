ultraviolet irradiation (uv) major risk factor development skin
cancer. moreover, increasing evidence suggests cutaneotropic human
papillomaviruses (hpv) beta genus play causal role co-factor
in development cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. homeodomain-interacting 
protein kinase 2 (hipk2) operates potential suppressor skin tumorigenesis
and stabilized uv-damage. hipk2 important regulator apoptosis,
which forms complex tumor suppressor p53, mediating p53
phosphorylation ser 46 thus promoting pro-apoptotic gene expression. in
our study, demonstrate cutaneous hpv23 e6 protein directly targets hipk2 
function. accordingly, hpv23 e6 interacts hipk2 vitro vivo.
furthermore, upon massive uvb-damage hpv23 e6 co-localizes endogenous hipk2 
at nuclear bodies. functionally, demonstrate hpv23 e6 inhibits
hipk2-mediated p53 ser 46 phosphorylation enforcing dissociation the
hipk2/p53 complex. addition, hpv23 e6 co-accumulates endogenous hipk2
upon uv damage suggesting mechanism hpv23 e6 keeps hipk2 check
after uv damage. thus, cutaneous hpv23 e6 prevents hipk2-mediated p53 ser 46
phosphorylation, may favour survival uv-damaged keratinocytes skin
carcinogenesis apoptosis evasion.
