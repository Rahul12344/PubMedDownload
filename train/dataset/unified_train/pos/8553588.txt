the e6 e7 proteins high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) act
coordinately immortalize human keratinocytes. viral oncoproteins
function binding altering activity cellular proteins regulate
cell cycle progression. among proteins bound e7 retinoblastoma
protein, rb, well related p107 p130 proteins. addition, e7 binds
cyclin a, regulates transit g2/m phases cell
cycle. study, demonstrate hpv 18 e7 also associates cyclin e
which controls g1/s transition. e7/cyclin e complexes immunoprecipitated
from e7-expressing cells well cell extracts using gst-e7 fusion
proteins. e7 found complex single form cyclin e, binding
was mediated p107. e7/cyclin e e7/cyclin complexes exhibit
kinase activity associated cdk2 proteins contribute to
phosphorylation p107. association e7 proteins regulate
transit cell cycle may provide additional mechanism which
infection human papillomaviruses results cellular hyperproliferation.
