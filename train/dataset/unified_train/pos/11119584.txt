we used yeast two-hybrid system screen cdna library prepared from
normal human epidermal keratinocytes identified protein partners human
papilloma virus (hpv) e6 proteins. clone encoded gps2 interacted e6
proteins hpvs high low oncogenic risk. specificity these
reactions verified regions e6 required interaction
were mapped. steady-state pulse-chase analyses cells cotransfected with
dnas expressing e6 either hpv6 hpv18 gps2 demonstrated e6
proteins induced degradation gps2 vivo vitro. gps2 exhibited
transcriptional activation activity, high-risk e6 suppressed activity.
