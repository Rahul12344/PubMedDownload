human papillomavirus (hpv) non-enveloped virus composed circular dna
genome two capsid proteins, l1 l2. multiple interactions its
capsid proteins host cellular proteins required infectious hpv entry,
including cell attachment internalization, intracellular trafficking and
viral genome transfer nucleus. using two variants hpv type 51, ma
and nu strains, previously reported mal2 required efficient
pseudovirus (psv) transduction. however, cellular factors confer l2
dependency yet identified. report transport
protein particle complex subunit 8 (trappc8) specifically interacts mal2.
trappc8 knockdown hela cells yielded reduced levels reporter gene
expression inoculated hpv51ma, hpv16, hpv31 psvs. trappc8 knockdown
in hacat cells also showed reduced susceptibility infection authentic
hpv31 virions, indicating trappc8 plays crucial role native hpv
infection. immunofluorescence microscopy revealed central region of
trappc8 exposed cell surface colocalized inoculated psvs. the
entry ma, nu, l2-lacking psvs cells equally impaired trappc8
knockdown hela cells, suggesting trappc8-dependent endocytosis plays an
important role hpv entry independent l2 interaction. finally,
expression gfp-fused l2 also interact trappc8 induced dispersal 
of golgi stack structure hela cells, phenotype also observed trappc8 
knockdown. results suggest viral intracellular trafficking,
binding l2 trappc8 inhibits function resulting golgi
destabilization, process may assist hpv genome escape trans-golgi
network.
