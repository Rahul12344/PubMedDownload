one important function human adenovirus e1b 55-kda protein induction of
selective nuclear export viral late mrnas. protein interacts the
viral e4 orf6 four cellular proteins form infected-cell-specific e3
ubiquitin ligase. assembly enzyme required efficient viral
late mrna export, neither relevant substrates cellular pathway
that exports viral late mrnas identified. therefore examined the
effects viral late gene expression inhibition synthesis activity 
of mrna export receptor nxf1, observed colocalize e1b
55-kda protein infected cells. production nxf1 impaired using
rna interference, efficiency viral late mrna export reduced a
corresponding degree. furthermore, synthesis dominant-negative derivative of
nxf1 late phase infection interfered production late
structural protein. observations indicate nxf1 pathway is
responsible export viral late mrnas. infected-cell-specific e3
ubiquitin ligase targets known substrates proteasomal degradation, we
compared concentrations several components pathway (nxf1, thox1,
and thoc4) infected cells contain enzyme. although
the concentration well-established substrate, mre11, decreased significantly
in cells infected adenovirus type 5 (ad5), infected the
e1b 55-kda protein-null mutant hr6, e1b 55-kda protein-dependent degradation
of nxf1 pathway proteins observed.
