viruses must enter host cells replicate, assemble propagate. of
the restricted size genomes, viruses evolve efficient ways
of exploiting host cell processes promote life cycles also to
escape host immune defence mechanisms. many viral open reading frames (viorfs)
with immune-modulating functions essential productive viral growth 
identified across range viral classes. however, no
comprehensive study identify host factors viorfs interact
for global perspective viral perturbation strategies. show that
different viral perturbation patterns host molecular defence network can
be deduced mass-spectrometry-based host-factor survey defined human
cellular system using 70 innate immune-modulating viorfs 30 viral
species. 579 host proteins targeted viorfs mapped unexpectedly
large number signalling pathways cellular processes, suggesting yet
unknown mechanisms antiviral immunity. experimentally verified 
targets heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein u, phosphatidylinositol-3-oh

peptidase 19) vulnerable nodes host cellular defence system. evaluation
of impact viral immune modulators host molecular network revealed
perturbation strategies used individual viruses viral classes. data
are also valuable design broad specific antiviral therapies.
