the cdna human homologue (hif2) bacterial (bif2) yeast (yif2)
translation initiation factor two (if2) identified screen for
proteins interact hiv-1 matrix. hif2 cdna encodes a
1220-amino-acid protein predicted relative molecular mass 139 kda,
though endogeneous hif2 migrates anomalously sds/page 180 kda. hif2 
extended n-terminus compared homologues, although central
gtp-binding domain c-terminus highly conserved, 58% sequence
identity yif2. confirmed hif2 required general
translation human cells generation point mutation p-loop the
gtp-binding domain. mutant protein behaves transdominant manner in
transient transfections leads significant decrease translation of
a reporter gene. hif2 interacts directly hiv-1 matrix gag vitro, 
the protein complex immunoprecipitated human cells. interaction 
appears block hif2 function, since purified matrix protein inhibits
translation reticulocyte lysate. hif2 correspond the
previously characterized translation initiation factors identified mammals,
but essential role translation appears conserved from
bacteria humans.
