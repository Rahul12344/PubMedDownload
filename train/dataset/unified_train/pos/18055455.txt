severe acute respiratory syndrome (sars) acute infectious disease with
significant mortality. typical clinical feature associated sars is
pulmonary fibrosis associated lung failure. however, underlying
mechanism remains elusive. study, demonstrate sars-associated
coronavirus (sars-cov) nucleocapsid (n) protein potentiates transforming growth
factor-beta (tgf-beta)-induced expression plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
but attenuates smad3/smad4-mediated apoptosis human peripheral lung epithelial
hpl1 cells. promoting effect n protein transcriptional responses of
tgf-beta smad3-specific. n protein associates smad3 promotes
smad3-p300 complex formation interferes complex formation
between smad3 smad4. findings provide evidence novel mechanism
whereby n protein modulates tgf-beta signaling block apoptosis of
sars-cov-infected host cells meanwhile promote tissue fibrosis. results
reveal novel mode smad3 action smad4-independent manner may lead to
successful strategies sars treatment targeting tgf-beta signaling
molecules.
