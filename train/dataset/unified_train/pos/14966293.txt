using yeast two-hybrid screen, identified human nucleosome assembly protein 
1 (hnap-1) protein interacting activation domain the
transcriptional activator encoded papillomaviruses (pvs), e2 protein. we
show interaction e2 hnap-1 direct merely mediated
by transcriptional coactivator p300, bound proteins.
coexpression hnap-1 strongly enhances activation e2, indicating a
functional interaction well. e2 binds least two separate domains within 
hnap-1, one within c terminus internal domain. binding e2 to
hnap-1 necessary cooperativity factors. moreover, the
n-terminal 91 amino acids crucial transcriptional activity hnap-1,
since deletion mutants lacking n-terminal portion fail cooperate e2.
we provide evidence hnap-1, e2, p300 form ternary complex
efficient activation transcription. also show p53 directly
interacts hnap-1, indicating transcriptional activators addition 
pv e2 interact hnap-1. results suggest binding of
sequence-specific dna binding proteins hnap-1 may important step
contributing activation transcription.
