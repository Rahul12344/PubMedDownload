human t-cell immunoglobulin mucin-domain containing proteins (tim1, 3, 4)
specifically bind phosphatidylserine (ps). tim1 proposed serve a
cellular receptor hepatitis virus ebola virus entry factor
for dengue virus. show tim1 promotes infection retroviruses and
virus-like particles (vlps) pseudotyped range viral entry proteins, 
particular filovirus, flavivirus, new world arenavirus and
alphavirus families. tim1 also robustly enhanced infection of
replication-competent viruses families, including dengue, tacaribe,
sindbis ross river viruses. interactions tim1 pseudoviruses
or vlps ps-mediated, demonstrated liposome blocking tim1
mutagenesis experiments. addition, ps-binding proteins, axl 
tim4, promoted infection similarly tim1. finally, blocking ps receptors
on macrophages inhibited entry ebola vlps, suggesting ps receptors
can contribute infection physiologically relevant cells. notably, infection
mediated entry proteins lassa fever virus, influenza virus sars
coronavirus largely unaffected tim1 expression. taken together data
show tim1 related ps-binding proteins promote infection diverse
families enveloped viruses, may therefore useful targets for
broad-spectrum antiviral therapies.
