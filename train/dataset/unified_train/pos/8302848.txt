retrovirus infection initiated binding viral envelope glycoprotein
to cell-surface receptor. envelope proteins type c retroviruses of
mammals demonstrate similarities structural organization protein sequence.
these similarities suggest possibility retroviruses different
interference groups might use related proteins receptors, despite absence 
of relationship retrovirus receptors isolated date. investigate
this possibility, identified human cdna clone encoding protein
closely related receptor gibbon ape leukemia virus found that
it functions receptor amphotropic group murine retroviruses.
expression protein (glvr-2) likely requirement infection
of human cells amphotropic retroviral vectors purposes gene therapy.
