most viruses exploit variety host cellular proteins primary cellular
attachment receptors context successful execution infection.
furthermore, many viral agents evolved precise mechanisms subvert host
immune recognition achieve persistence. herein present data indicating that
adenovirus (ad) serotype 3 utilizes cd80 (b7.1) cd86 (b7.2) cellular
attachment receptors. cd80 cd86 co-stimulatory molecules present
on mature dendritic cells b lymphocytes involved stimulating
t-lymphocyte activation. knowledge, one first
demonstrations virus utilizing immunologic accessory molecules primary 
means cellular entry. finding suggests mechanism whereby viral
exploitation proteins receptors may achieve goals cellular
entry evading immune system.
