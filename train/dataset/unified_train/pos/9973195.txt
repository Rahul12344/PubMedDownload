apoptosis regulated interaction viral cellular bcl-2 family
antiapoptotic proteins various pro-apoptotic proteins, several 
also members bcl-2 family. cellular protein bnip3 bcl-2 family
proapoptotic protein interacts viral antiapoptosis proteins as
adenoviruses e1b-19k ebv-bhrf1 cellular antiapoptosis proteins as
bcl-2 bcl-xl. database searches indicate human genome encodes an
open reading frame protein, bnip3alpha, shares substantial homology
with bnip3. bnip3alpha open reading frame encodes protein 219 amino
acids contains conserved bh3 domain cooh-terminal trans-membrane
domain, characteristic several bcl-2 family proapoptotic proteins. bnip3alpha 
interacts viral antiapoptosis protein e1b-19k cellular antiapoptosis
proteins bcl-2 bcl-xl. overexpression bnip3alpha transfected cells
results apoptosis suppresses antiapoptosis activity e1b-19k and
bcl-xl. like bnip3, bnip3alpha seems predominantly localized in
mitochondria. results suggest bnip3alpha structural and
functional homologue bnip3. bnip3 bnip3alpha seem first examples
of homologues among various human proapoptotic proteins. northern blot
analysis reveals bnip3alpha expressed ubiquitously human tissues.
in contrast, bnip3 expressed well several human tissues less abundantly
in certain tissues placenta lung. results suggest although
bnip3 bnip3alpha may promote apoptosis simultaneously human tissues, 
bnip3alpha may play universal role.
