understanding molecular mechanisms involved virus replication particle
assembly primary fundamental biomedical importance. intrinsic
conformational disorder plays prominent role viral proteins their
interaction viral host cell proteins via transiently populated
structural elements. here, report results investigation an
intrinsically disordered 188-residue fragment hepatitis c virus
non-structural protein 5a (ns5a), contains classical poly-proline src
homology 3 (sh3) binding motif, using sensitivity- resolution-optimized
multidimensional nmr methods, complemented small-angle x-ray scattering data. 
our study provides detailed atomic-resolution information transient local 
long-range structure, well fast time scale dynamics ns5a fragment. 
in addition, could characterize two distinct interaction modes sh3
domain bin1 (bridging integrator protein 1), pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor.
despite largely disordered, protein contains three regions that
transiently adopt α-helical structures, partly stabilized long-range tertiary 
interactions. two transient α-helices form noncanonical sh3-binding
motif, allows low-affinity sh3 binding. results contribute better 
understanding role ns5a protein hepatitis c virus infection.
the present work also highlights power nmr spectroscopy characterize
multiple binding events including short-lived transient interactions between
globular highly disordered proteins.
