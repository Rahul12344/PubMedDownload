viral rna elements facilitate mrna export useful tools identifying
cellular rna export factors. show hepatitis b virus
post-transcriptional element (pre) one element, using pre several new
cellular mrna export factors identified. found pre drastically
enhances cytoplasmic accumulation cdna transcripts independent any
viral protein. systematic deletion analysis revealed existence 116 nt
functional sub-element pre (sep1). rnp forms sep1 rna was
affinity purified, trex components well several proteins
were identified. trex components sep1-associating protein zc3h18 are
required sep1-mediated mrna export. significantly, zc3h18 directly binds to
the sep1 rna, interacts trex required stable association trex 
with sep1-containing mrna. requirements sep1-mediated mrna export are
similar splicing-dependent mrna export. consistent these
similarities, several sep1-interacting proteins, including zc3h18, ars2, acinus
and brr2, required efficient nuclear export polya rnas. together, 
data indicate sep1 enhances mrna export recruiting trex via zc3h18. the
new mrna export factors identified might involved cap- and
splicing-dependent trex recruitment cellular mrnas.
