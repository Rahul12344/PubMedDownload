the bzlf1 gene controls switch latent lytic infection by
epstein-barr virus (ebv). previously reported zv ziir
elements within bzlf1 promoter, zp, potent transcription silencers within
the context intact ebv genome. report identification another
sequence element, zv', synergized zv repressing zp via binding zeb1
or zeb2. determined phenotype variant ebv strain b95.8 in
which zv, zv', ziir elements concurrently mutated. hek293 cell lines
infected triple mutant (tmt) virus spontaneously synthesized 6- to
10-fold viral bzlf1, brlf1, bmrf1, bllf1 rnas, 3- 6-fold viral
zta, rta, ead proteins, 3- 5-fold viral dna, 7- 9-fold more
infectious virus 293 cell lines latently infected either zv zv'
double mutant (dmt) ziir mutant (mt) virus. zv zv' ziir tmt ebv
efficiently infected human primary blood b cells vitro, highly
defective immortalizing them. instead nearly complete silencing of
bzlf1 gene expression occurs within 4 days primary infection with
wild-type ebv, zv zv' ziir tmt-infected cells continued synthesize bzlf1
rna, 90% dying within 9 days postinfection. bl41 cells infected with
this "superlytic" virus also exhibited increased synthesis bzlf1 bmrf1
rnas. thus, conclude zv, zv', ziir silencing elements act
synergistically repress transcription zp, thereby tightly controlling
bzlf1 gene expression, crucial establishing maintaining ebv
latency.
