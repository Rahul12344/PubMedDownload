the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) potent transactivator tat protein
mediates pleiotropic effects various cell functions. posttranslational
modification tat affects activity viral transcription. tat binds to
tar subsequently becomes acetylated lysine residues histone
acetyltransferases. novel protein-protein interaction domains acetylated tat
are established, necessary sustained transcriptional
activation hiv-1 promoter viral transcription elongation. this
study, investigated identity proteins preferentially bound
acetylated tat. using proteomic approach, identified number proteins
that preferentially bound actat, among p32, cofactor splicing factor
asf/sf-2, identified. found p32 recruited hiv-1 genome,
suggesting mechanism acetylation tat may inhibit hiv-1 splicing
needed production full-length transcripts. using tat different
clades, harboring different number acetylation sites, well tat mutated
at lysine residues, demonstrated tat acetylation affected splicing in
vivo. finally, using confocal microscopy, found p32 tat colocalize in
vivo hiv-1-infected cells.
