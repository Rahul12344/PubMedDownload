nipah virus (niv) emergent paramyxovirus causes fatal encephalitis 
up 70 percent infected patients, evidence human-to-human
transmission. endothelial syncytia, comprised multinucleated giant-endothelial
cells, frequently found niv infections, mediated fusion (f)
and attachment (g) envelope glycoproteins. identification receptor for
this virus shed light pathobiology niv infection, spur the
rational development effective therapeutics. report ephrinb2, the
membrane-bound ligand ephb class receptor tyrosine kinases (rtks),
specifically binds attachment (g) glycoprotein niv. soluble fc-fusion
proteins ephrinb2, ephrinb1, effectively block niv fusion entry
into permissive cell types. moreover, transfection ephrinb2 into
non-permissive cells renders permissive niv fusion entry. ephrinb2
is expressed endothelial cells neurons, consistent known
cellular tropism niv. significantly, find niv-envelope-mediated
infection microvascular endothelial cells primary cortical rat neurons 
inhibited soluble ephrinb2, related ephrinb1 protein.
cumulatively, data show ephrinb2 functional receptor niv.
