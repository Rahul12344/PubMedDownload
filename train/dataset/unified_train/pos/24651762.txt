west nile virus (wnv) positive sense rna genome conserved structural
elements 5' 3' -untranslated regions required polyprotein
production. antiviral immunity wnv partially mediated the
production cluster proteins known interferon stimulated genes
(isgs). 2' 5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (oas) key isgs help to
amplify innate immune response. upon interaction viral double stranded
rna, oas enzymes become activated enable host cell restrict viral
propagation. studies linked mutations oas1 gene increased
susceptibility wnv infection, highlighting importance oas1 enzyme. here
we report region 5'-end wnv genome comprising the
5'-utr initial coding region capable oas1 activation vitro. this
region contains three rna stem loops (sli, slii, sliii), whose relative
contribution oas1 binding affinity activation investigated using
electrophoretic mobility shift assays enzyme kinetics experiments. stem loop 
i, comprising nucleotides 1-73, dispensable maximum oas1 activation, 
construct containing slii sliii capable enzymatic activation.
mutations rna binding site oas1 confirmed specificity the
interaction. purity, monodispersity homogeneity 5'-end
(sli/ii/iii) oas1 evaluated using dynamic light scattering and
analytical ultra-centrifugation. solution conformations 5'-end rna of
wnv oas1 elucidated using small-angle x-ray scattering. the
context purified components vitro, data demonstrate recognition
of conserved secondary structural elements wnv genome member the
interferon-mediated innate immune response.
