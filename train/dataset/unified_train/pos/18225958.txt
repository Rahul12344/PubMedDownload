intrinsic immunity relies specific recognition viral epitopes mount a
cell-autonomous defense viral infections. viral recognition determinants 
in intrinsic immunity genes expected evolve rapidly host genes adapt to
changing viruses, resulting signature adaptive evolution. zinc-finger
antiviral protein (zap) rats discovered intrinsic immunity gene
that restrict murine leukemia virus, certain alphaviruses and
filoviruses. here, used approach combining molecular evolution cellular
infectivity assays address whether zap also acts restriction factor in
primates, pinpoint protein domains may directly interact the
virus. find zap evolved positive selection throughout primate
evolution. recurrent positive selection found poly(adp-ribose)
polymerase (parp)-like domain present longer human zap isoform. this
parp-like domain present previously identified tested rat zap 
gene. using infectivity assays, found longer isoform zap that
contains parp-like domain stronger suppressor murine leukemia virus
expression semliki forest virus infection. study thus finds human
zap encodes potent antiviral activity alphaviruses. striking
congruence evolutionary predictions cellular infectivity assays
strongly validates combined approach study intrinsic immunity genes.
