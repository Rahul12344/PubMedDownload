human immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat protein one soluble
neurotoxins. studies date focused tat extracellular
molecule role neuronal apoptosis, recombinant tat protein often 
used studies. study, expressed tat protein astrocytes 
neurons, examined effects cells. found tat expression
resulted growth inhibition astrocytes, neurons, well non-glial cells 
293t. showed tat interacted number cell cycle-related
proteins including cyclin a, cyclin b, cyclin d3, cdk2, cdk4, cdk1/cdc2, cdc6,
p27, p53, p63, hdlg, pcna. data demonstrate tat inhibited cell
proliferation expressed intracellularly, suggest tat interactions
with multiple cell cycle regulators may account anti-proliferative
effect. results support notion tat-induced neuropathogenesis is
mediated multiple mechanisms involving intracellular extracellular
tat protein.
