background: interaction non-structural protein 5a (ns5a) hepatitis c virus 
(hcv) human kinases namely, casein kinase 1α (ck1α) protein kinase r
(pkr) different functional implications regulation viral
replication evasion interferon induced immune response respectively.
understanding structural molecular basis interactions viral
protein two different human kinases useful developing strategies
for treatment hcv.
results: serine 232 ns5a known phosphorylated human ck1α. a
structural model ns5a peptide containing phosphoacceptor residue serine 232
bound ck1α generated using known 3-d structures kinase-peptide
complexes. substrate interacting residues ck1α identified from
the model found conserved well ck1 family. ck1α -
substrate peptide complex also used understand structural basis
of association ck1α viral stress induced substrate, tumour 
suppressor p53 transactivation domain crystal structure
available.interaction ns5a another human kinase pkr primarily genotype
specific. ns5a genotype 1b shown interact inhibit pkr
whereas ns5a genotype 2a/3a unable bind inhibit pkr efficiently. 
this one main reasons varied response interferon therapy 
hcv patients across different genotypes. using pkr crystal structure, sequence
alignment evolutionary trace analysis critical residues
responsible interaction ns5a 1b pkr identified.
conclusions: substrate interacting residues ck1α identified
using structural model kinase - substrate peptide. pkr interacting
ns5a 1b residues also predicted using pkr crystal structure, ns5a
sequence analysis along known experimental results. functional significance 
and nature interaction interferon sensitivity determining region and
variable region 3 ns5a different genotypes pkr was
experimentally shown also supported findings evolutionary trace
analysis. designing inhibitors prevent interaction could enable hcv
genotype 1 infected patients respond well interferon therapy.
