the human papillomavirus-16 (hpv16) e5 gene able induce stable growth
transformation transient mitogenic stimulation variety cultured cell 
systems. characterize biochemical properties hydrophobic hpv16 e5
transforming protein, constructed vectors expressing wild-type hpv16 
e5 gene generated antipeptide antisera. 10-kda e5 protein was
readily detectable transfected cos monkey cells using antisera either
for immunoprecipitation metabolically labeled cells immunoblotting.
coimmunoprecipitation analysis cells coexpressing viral protein and
various growth factor receptors demonstrated stable complex formation the
e5 protein epidermal growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth
factor beta receptor, colony stimulating factor-1 receptor, p185neu. e5
protein also formed stable complex vesicular stomatitis virus
glycoprotein. experiments indicated hpv16 e5 protein able to
participate complex formation variety transmembrane proteins, a
property may contribute biological activities viral protein. 
in addition, expression vectors antibodies described useful 
reagents examining various aspects hpv16 e5 expression function.
