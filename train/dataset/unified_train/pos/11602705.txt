virus-cell surface receptor interactions major interest. hepadnaviruses
are family partially double-stranded dna viruses liver tropism a
narrow host range susceptibility infection. least case duck
hepatitis b virus (dhbv), host specificity seems controlled partly the
receptor level. middle portion pre-s region viral large
envelope protein binds specifically duck carboxypeptidase (dcpd) 
its human chicken homologue. although domain c dcpd implicated ligand
binding, exact pre-s contact site remains determined. prepared and
tested panel chimeric constructs consisting dcpd human
carboxypeptidase (hcpd). results indicate short region n
terminus domain c (residues 920 949) critical dhbv binding a
major determinant host specificity dhbv infection. replacing this
region dcpd molecule human homologue abolished dhbv
interaction, whereas introducing dcpd sequence hcpd conferred efficient
dhbv binding. extensive analysis site-directed mutants revealed both
conserved nonconserved residues important pre-s interaction.
there primary sequence variations secondary structural differences 
contributed inability hcpd bind dhbv pre-s domain.
