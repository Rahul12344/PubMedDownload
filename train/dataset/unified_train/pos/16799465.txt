in higher eukaryotes, origin recognition complex (orc) lacks
sequence-specific dna binding, remains unclear factors specify 
an origin dna replication. epstein-barr virus origin plasmid
replication (orip) recruits orc, precise mechanism orc recruitment and
origin activation clear. show orc recruited selectively 
the dyad symmetry (ds) region orip consequence direct interactions
with telomere repeat factor 2 (trf2) orc1. trf-binding sites within ds
stimulate replication initiation facilitate orc recruitment vitro in
vivo. trf2, trf1 hrap1, recruits orc nuclear extracts. the
amino-terminal domain trf2 associated specific region orc1 was
necessary stimulation dna replication. results support model in
which trf2 stimulates orip replication activity direct binding orc
subunits.
