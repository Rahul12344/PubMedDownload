the poxvirus molluscum contagiosum (mc) worldwide distribution its
prevalence rise. report mcv mc013l protein inhibits
glucocorticoid vitamin d, retinoid estrogen, nuclear receptor
transactivation. direct interaction mc013l glucocorticoid vitamin d
receptor supported yeast two-hybrid, gst pull-down, far western blot
analyses. glucocorticoids act potent inhibitors keratinocyte proliferation,
while vitamin retinoids promote block terminal differentiation,
respectively. therefore, mc013l may promote efficient virus replication by
blocking differentiation infected keratinocytes. mc013l may first
member new class poxvirus proteins directly modulate nuclear
receptor-mediated transcription.
