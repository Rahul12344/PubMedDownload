nuclear sensing viral dna emerged essential step innate immune
responses herpesviruses. here, provide mechanistic insight host
recognition human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) subsequent immune evasion this
prominent dna virus. establish interferon-inducible protein ifi16
acts nuclear dna sensor following hcmv infection, binding viral dna and
triggering expression antiviral cytokines via sting-tbk1-irf3 signaling
pathway. hcmv tegument protein pul83 inhibits response interacting
with ifi16 pyrin domain, blocking oligomerization upon dna sensing and
subsequent immune signals. pul83 disrupts ifi16 concerted action n- and
c-terminal domains, evolutionarily conserved n-terminal pyrin
association domain (pad) binds ifi16. additionally, phosphorylation the
n-terminal domain modulates pul83-mediated inhibition pyrin aggregation.
collectively, data elucidate interplay host dna sensing hcmv 
immune evasion, providing targets restoring antiviral immunity.
