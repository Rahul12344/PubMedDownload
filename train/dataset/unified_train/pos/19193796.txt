human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression replication are
regulated promoter/enhancer located u3 region proviral 5'
long terminal repeat (ltr). binding cellular transcription factors to
specific regulatory sites 5' ltr key event replication cycle
of hiv-1. since transcriptional activity regulated posttranslational
modification transcription factors monosaccharide o-linked
n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (o-glcnac), evaluated whether increased o-glcnacylation
affects hiv-1 transcription. present study demonstrate treatment
of hiv-1-infected lymphocytes o-glcnacylation-enhancing agent
glucosamine (glcn) repressed viral transcription dose-dependent manner.
overexpression o-glcnac transferase (ogt), sole known enzyme catalyzing
the addition o-glcnac proteins, specifically inhibited activity 
hiv-1 ltr promoter different t-cell lines primary cd4(+) lymphocytes.
inhibition hiv-1 ltr activity infected cells efficient (>95%)
when ogt recombinantly overexpressed prior infection. o-glcnacylation of
the transcription factor sp1 presence sp1-binding sites ltr
were found crucial inhibitory effect. study, conclude
that o-glcnacylation sp1 inhibits activity hiv-1 ltr promoter.
modulation sp1 o-glcnacylation may play role regulation hiv-1
latency activation links viral replication glucose metabolism of
the host cell. hence, establishment metabolic treatment might supplement
the repertoire antiretroviral therapies aids.
