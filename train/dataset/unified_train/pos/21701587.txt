the ebv-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) functions constitutive
active form tumor necrosis factor receptor (tnfr) activates multiple
downstream signaling pathways similar cd40 signaling ligand-independent
manner. lmp1 expression ebv-infected cells postulated play an
important role pathogenesis nasopharyngeal carcinoma. however, variable
levels lmp1 expression detected nasopharyngeal carcinoma. present, 
the regulation lmp1 levels nasopharyngeal carcinoma poorly understood.
here show lmp1 mrnas transcribed ebv-positive nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (npc) cell line (c666-1) ebv-negative nasopharyngeal
carcinoma cells stably re-infected ebv. protein levels lmp1 could
readily detected incubation proteasome inhibitor, mg132 suggesting 
that lmp1 protein rapidly degraded via proteasome-mediated proteolysis.
interestingly, observed id1 overexpression could stabilize lmp1 protein
in ebv-infected cells. contrary, id1 knockdown significantly reduced lmp1
levels cells. co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed id1 interacts 
lmp1 binding ctar1 domain lmp1. n-terminal region id1 required
for interaction lmp1. furthermore, binding id1 lmp1 suppressed
polyubiquitination lmp1 may involved stabilization lmp1 in
ebv-infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cells.
