hiv-1 infection antiretroviral therapy associated dyslipidemia
marked low levels high-density lipoprotein increased cardiovascular
disease, unclear whether virion replication plays causative role in
these changes. hiv-1 nef protein impair atp cassette binding transporter 
a1 (abca1) cholesterol efflux macrophages, potentially pro-atherosclerotic
effect. viral inhibition efflux correlated direct interaction 
between abca1 nef. here, defined abca1 domain required the
nef-abca1 protein-protein interaction determined whether interaction
mediates ability nef downregulate abca1. nef expressed hek 293 cells
strongly inhibited abca1 efflux protein levels alter levels of
cmir, another transmembrane protein. analysis panel abca1 c-terminal
mutants showed nef binding required abca1 c-terminal amino acids between
positions 2225 2231. however, binding nef abca1 required
for inhibition c-terminal abca1 mutants bind nef were
still downregulated nef. given discordance, mechanism of
downregulation investigated found involve acceleration of
abca1 protein degradation depend upon abca1 pest sequence,
which mediates calpain proteolysis abca1. furthermore, not
associate nef-dependent induction signaling unfolded
protein response significantly dependent upon proteasomal function and
could act abca1 mutant fails exit endoplasmic reticulum. in
summary, show nef downregulates abca1 function post-translational
mechanism stimulates abca1 degradation require ability of
nef bind abca1.
