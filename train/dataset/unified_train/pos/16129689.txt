the epstein-barr virus early protein eb2 (also called bmlf1, mta, sm), a
protein absolutely required production infectious virions, shares
properties mrna export factors. using yeast two-hybrid screen, 
identified human protein ott3 eb2-interacting factor. ott3 new
member spen (split end) family proteins (husharp, huott1, dmspen, and
mumint), characterized several n-terminal rna recognition motifs and
a highly conserved c-terminal spoc (spen paralog ortholog c-terminal) domain 
that, case sharp, shown interact smrt/ncor
corepressors. ott3 ubiquitously expressed 120-kda protein. transfected
ott3 nonshuttling nuclear protein co-localizes co-transfected eb2.
we also showed eb2 interacts spoc domains ott1 sharp
proteins. although ott3 interaction domain maps within 40 n-terminal
amino acids eb2, ott1 sharp interact within c-terminal half the
protein. furthermore, demonstrated capacity ott3 ott1 spoc
domains interact smrt repress transcription far weaker that
of sharp. thus evidence role ott3 transcriptional
regulation. interestingly, however, found ott3 role in
splicing regulation; ott3 represses accumulation alternatively spliced
beta-thalassemia mrnas, effect beta-globin constitutively
spliced mrna. thus results suggested new function spen proteins related
to mrna export splicing.
