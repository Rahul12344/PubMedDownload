several human animal alphaherpesviruses enter cells via human herpesvirus
entry mediator c (hvec), receptor viral glycoprotein (gd). previous
studies cells expressing unknown entry mediators, cellular expression of
alphaherpesvirus gd shown inhibit entry homologous virus and
sometimes also heterologous alphaherpesviruses. investigate mechanism
of gd-mediated interference basis cross-interference among
alphaherpesviruses, hvec expressed cells sole entry mediator, in
the presence absence one gds encoded herpes simplex virus type 1,
pseudorabies virus, bovine herpesvirus type 1. cells expressing hvec alone
were highly susceptible entry three viruses, whereas cells coexpressing
hvec one gds least partially resistant infection by
each virus. coexpression gd hvec cause reduced levels of
cell-surface hvec hvec reduced ability bind exogenous gd.
coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed hvec complexed gd in
lysates cells expressing both. thus, cellular expression gd interfere
with alphaherpesvirus entry blocking ligand-binding sites gd
receptor(s) used entry cross-interference occur different
forms alphaherpesvirus gd compete shared entry receptors.
