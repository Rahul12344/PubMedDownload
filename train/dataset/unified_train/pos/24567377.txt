toll-like receptors (tlrs) play key roles innate immune recognition of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns invading microbes. among 10 tlr
family members identified humans, tlr10 remains orphan receptor without
known agonist function. tlr10 pseudogene mice mouse models are
noninformative regard. using influenza virus infection primary human
peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages human monocytic cell line, we
now provide previously unidentified evidence tlr10 plays role innate
immune responses following viral infection. influenza virus infection increased
tlr10 expression tlr10 contributed innate immune sensing viral
infection leading cytokine induction, including proinflammatory cytokines 
interferons. tlr10 induction pronounced following infection highly
pathogenic avian influenza h5n1 virus compared low pathogenic h1n1 virus. 
induction tlr10 virus infection requires active virus replication de
novo protein synthesis. culture supernatants virus-infected cells modestly
up-regulate tlr10 expression nonvirus-infected cells. signaling via tlr10 
activated functional rna-protein complex influenza virus leading to
robust induction cytokine expression. taken together, findings identify
tlr10 important innate immune sensor viral infection role in
innate immune defense immunopathology following viral bacterial pathogens
deserves attention.
