maintenance kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) latent infection
depends viral episomes nucleus distributed daughter cells 
following cell division. latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) is
constitutively expressed kshv-infected cells. lana binds sequences 
terminal repeat regions kshv genome tethers viral episomes to
chromosomes. better understand mechanism chromosomal tethering, we
performed glutathione s-transferase (gst) affinity yeast two-hybrid assays to
identify lana-interacting proteins known chromosomal association. two the
interactors methyl cpg binding protein mecp2 43-kda protein dek.
the interactions mecp2 dek lana confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation. mecp2-interacting domain mapped previously 
described chromatin binding site n terminus lana, the
dek-interacting domain mapped lana amino acids 986 1043 c terminus. 
lana unable associate mouse chromosomes chromosome spreads of
transfected nih 3t3 cells. however, lana capable targeting mouse
chromosomes presence human mecp2 dek. data indicate lana is
tethered chromosomes two independent chromatin binding domains that
interact different protein partners.
