human papillomaviruses (hpvs) cause benign malignant tumors mucosal
and cutaneous epithelium. initial events regulating hpv infection impact 
establishment viral persistence, requisite malignant progression 
of hpv-infected lesions. however, precise mechanisms involved hpv entry
into host cells, including cellular factors regulating virus uptake, 
clearly defined. show hpv16 exposure human keratinocytes initiates
epidermal growth factor receptor (egfr)-dependent src protein kinase activation
that results phosphorylation extracellular translocation annexin a2
(anxa2). hpv16 particles interact anxa2 association s100a10 a
heterotetramer cell surface ca(2+)-dependent manner, the
interaction appears involve heparan-sulfonated proteoglycans. show multiple
lines evidence interaction promotes virus uptake host cells. an
antibody anxa2 prevents hpv16 internalization, whereas antibody s100a10 
blocks infection late endosomal/lysosomal site. results suggest that
anxa2 s100a10 separate roles hpv16 binding, entry, and
trafficking. data additionally imply anxa2 s100a10 may involved
in regulating intracellular trafficking virus particles prior nuclear
delivery viral genome.
