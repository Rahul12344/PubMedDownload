human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) replication major natural target cells,
cd4+ lymphocytes macrophages, parallel many aspects virus life
cycle. however, differs viral assembly budding, take place 
plasma membranes cells endosomal membranes macrophages. has
been postulated cell type-specific host factors may aid directing viral
assembly distinct destinations. study defined annexin 2 (anx2) a
novel hiv gag binding partner macrophages. anx2-gag binding confined to
productively infected macrophages detected quiescently infected
monocyte-derived macrophages (mdm) hiv replication block mapped
to late stages viral life cycle (a. v. albright, r. m. vos, f.
gonzalez-scarano, virology 325:328-339, 2004). demonstrate anx2-gag
interaction likely occurs limiting membranes late
endosomes/multivesicular bodies anx2 depletion associated a
significant decline infectivity released virions; coincided with
incomplete gag processing inefficient incorporation cd63. cumulatively,
our data suggest anx2 essential proper assembly hiv mdm.
