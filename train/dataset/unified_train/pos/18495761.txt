the human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) tax transactivator known to
induce repress various cellular genes, several encoding transcription 
factors. tax known deregulate various basic bhlh factors, looked more
specifically effect tal1 (t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 1), also 
known scl (stem cell leukemia). indeed, tal1 deregulated high
percentage t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, oncogenic
properties well-established. show tax induces transcription of
this proto-oncogene stimulating activity tal1 gene promoter 1b,
through creb nf-kappab pathways. also observed tal1
upregulates htlv-1 promoter activity, either presence absence of
tax. viral promoter inhibited trans expression e2a protein
e47, tal1 able abrogate inhibition. data show existence 
of positive feedback loop tax tal1 expression support the
notion proto-oncogene participates generation adult t-cell
leukemia/lymphoma increasing amount tax oncoprotein also
possibly transforming activities.
