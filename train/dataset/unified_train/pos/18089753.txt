myristoylation human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) proteins gag
and nef n-myristoyltransferase (nmt) key process retroviral
replication virulence, yet remains incompletely characterized. therefore, the
roles two isozymes, nmt1 nmt2, myristoylating gag nef were
examined using biochemical molecular approaches. fluorescently labelled
peptides corresponding n terminus hiv-1 gag nef myristoylated
by recombinant human nmt1 nmt2. kinetic analyses indicated nmt1 nmt2
had 30- 130-fold lower k(m )values nef gag, respectively. values for
k(cat) indicated that, gag nef binds enzyme, myristoylation by
nmt1 nmt2 proceeds comparable rates. furthermore, catalytic
efficiencies processing gag nmt1 nmt2 equivalent. in
contrast, nmt2 approximately 5-fold higher catalytic efficiency the
myristoylation nef nmt1. competition experiments confirmed nef
peptide acts competitive inhibitor myristoylation gag.
experiments using full-length recombinant nef protein also indicated lower k(m)
for nef myristoylation nmt2 nmt1. small interfering rnas used to
selectively deplete nmt1 and/or nmt2 hek293t cells expressing recombinant 
nef-sggfp fusion protein. depletion nmt1 minimal effect the
intracellular distribution nef-sggfp, whereas depletion nmt2 altered
distribution diffuse, widespread pattern, mimicking a
myristoylation-deficient mutant nef-sggfp. together, findings indicate
that nef preferentially myristoylated nmt2, suggesting selective
inhibition nmt2 may provide novel means blocking hiv virulence.
