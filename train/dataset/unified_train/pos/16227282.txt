latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (lana-1) kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (kshv) mediates episomal replication kshv genome, well 
as transcriptional regulation, latently infected cells. interaction lana-1 
with cellular chromatin required functions. n-terminal
heterochromatin-binding site lana-1 essential replication and
maintenance latent episomes, well transcriptional regulation. have
recently described c-terminal domain lana-1 modulates interaction
with cellular interphase chromatin elements nuclear matrix. here, we
used series lana-1 deletion mutants investigate relationship 
the different functions lana-1 interaction host
chromatin-binding protein brd2/ring3. findings suggest c-terminal
chromatin-binding domain lana-1 required multiple lana-1 functions,
including ability bind replicate viral episomal dna, modulate
transcription, interact brd2/ring3. similar recently described
tethering bovine papillomavirus e2 protein host chromatin via brd4/mcap,
brd2/ring3, another member brd family chromatin-binding proteins,
therefore interacts chromatin-binding region another viral latent
nuclear protein could play role multiple functions.
