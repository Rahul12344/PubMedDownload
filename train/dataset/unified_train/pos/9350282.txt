serum amyloid p component (sap) member phylogenetically conserved and
structurally related group proteins called pentraxins. sap exhibits
multispecific calcium-dependent binding oligosaccharides terminal
n-acetyl-galactosamine, mannose glucuronic acid. authors report sap 
can bind influenza virus inhibit agglutination erythrocytes mediated 
by virus subtypes h1n1, h2n2 h3n2. sap also inhibits production of
haemagglutinin (ha) cytopathogenic effect influenza virus mdck
cells. binding sap virus requires physiological calcium
concentrations blocked specific sap antibodies. denaturated and
renaturated sap retained inhibition ha. electron microscopy shows
ca(2+)-dependent binding sap spikes viral envelope and
immunoblotting indicates sap binds 50-55 kda peptide corresponding to
the mass ha1 peptide. several monosaccharides tested d-mannose
interfered sap's inhibition ha infectivity. the
glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate heparin, bind sap, reduced saps
binding virus. results indicate inhibition sap due to
steric effects sap binds terminal mannose oligosaccharides localized
close sialic acid-binding site ha trimer.
