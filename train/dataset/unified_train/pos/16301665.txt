mucosal surfaces vagina portals heterosexual transmission of
hiv-1 therefore play fundamental role pathogenesis primary
infection. search direct biological evidence role human
vaginal fluid innate host defense, characterized anti-hiv-1 function of
cationic polypeptides within minimally manipulated vaginal fluid. current 
study revealed vaginal fluid confers intrinsic anti-hiv-1 properties
against x4 r5 strains hiv-1 could protect hiv-1 infection
and reduce proviral genome integration organotypic cultures human
cervicovaginal tissue. majority activity contained the
cationic polypeptide fraction, depletion cationic polypeptides using a
selective cation exchange resin ablated intrinsic activity against
hiv-1. adding cationic polypeptide fraction depleted vaginal fluid, 
were able restore activity hiv-1. using proteomic approach, we
identified 18 cationic polypeptides within vaginal fluid, nearly are
either known antimicrobials purported roles host defense.
interestingly, physiologic concentrations 13 cationic polypeptides were
not active alone hiv-1, yet concert partially restored the
anti-hiv-1 activity cation-depleted vaginal fluid. results suggest 
synergism cationic polypeptides complex, full anti-hiv-1 activity 
probably involves aggregate cationic peptides proteins vaginal 
fluid.
