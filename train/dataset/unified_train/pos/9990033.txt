although present many copies mouse genome, xenotropic murine leukemia
viruses cannot infect cells laboratory mice lack a
functional cell surface receptor required virus entry. contrast, cells
from many nonmurine species, including human cells, fully permissive. using
an expression library approach, isolated cdna hela cell rna that
conferred susceptibility xenotropic envelope protein binding virus
infection expressed nonpermissive cells. deduced product 696-aa 
multiple-membrane spanning molecule, widely expressed human tissues, and
shares homology nematode, fly, plant proteins unknown function as
well yeast syg1 protein, shown interact g
protein. molecule also acts receptor polytropic murine leukemia
viruses, consistent observed interference xenotropic polytropic 
viruses cell types. xenotropic polytropic retrovirus receptor
(xpr1) fourth identified molecule multiple membrane spanning
domains among mammalian type c oncoretrovirus receptors may play role g 
protein-coupled signal transduction, chemokine receptors required for
hiv entry.
