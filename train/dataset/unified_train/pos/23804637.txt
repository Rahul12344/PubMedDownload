alphaherpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (prv), spread directionally
within nervous systems mammalian hosts. three viral membrane
proteins required efficient anterograde-directed spread infection in
neurons, including us9 heterodimer composed glycoproteins ge gi.
we previously demonstrated kinesin-3 motor kif1a mediates
anterograde-directed transport viral particles axons cultured peripheral
nervous system (pns) neurons. prv us9 protein copurifies kif1a,
recruiting motor transport vesicles, least one unidentified
additional viral protein necessary interaction. show that
ge/gi required efficient anterograde transport viral particles in
axons mediating interaction us9 kif1a. absence of
ge/gi, viral particles containing green fluorescent protein (gfp)-tagged us9 
assembled cell body sorted efficiently axons.
importantly, found ge/gi necessary efficient copurification of
kif1a us9, especially early times infection. also constructed 
prv recombinant expresses functional ge-gfp fusion protein used
affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry identify ge-interacting
proteins. several viral host proteins found associate ge-gfp.
importantly, gi us9, kif1a, copurified ge-gfp. propose
that ge/gi required efficient kif1a-mediated anterograde transport of
viral particles indirectly facilitate stabilize interaction
between us9 kif1a.
