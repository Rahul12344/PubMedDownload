vpr hiv-1 auxiliary regulatory protein packaged virion. 
shown enhance nuclear transport hiv-1 pre-integration complex,
activate transcription cellular viral promoters, arrest cell cycle
at g2/m check-point. previously identified cellular protein 180 kda
(rip) interacted hiv-1 vpr specifically. rename cellular
protein vpr-binding protein, vprbp. report, describe cloning
of vprbp cdna encodes 1507 aa residues identical the
previously cloned cdna kiaa0800. demonstrate vpr specifically interacts
with recombinantly expressed vprbp vitro well vivo. furthermore, vpr 
interacts cellular endogenous vprbp context hiv-1 life
cycle. mutational analysis vprbp suggests vpr binding domain is
located within c-terminal half vprbp, pro-rich domain and
several phe-x-x-phe repeats. subcellular fractionation studies show the
endogenous vprbp adenovirus-expressed vprbp distributed predominantly
in cytoplasmic fraction. consistent previous reports, the
adenovirus-expressed vpr distributed cytoplasmic nuclear
fractions. however, vprbp vpr expressed together, vpr found
almost exclusively cytoplasm. expression vprbp affect the
nuclear transport adenoviral nuclear protein, ptp. vprbp expressed in
insect cells also blocks nuclear transport vpr-gfp fusion protein, and
vprbp mutants incapable interacting vpr fail block vpr-gfp nuclear
transport. hypothesize vpr interaction vprbp may cause changes in
the host cell cytoplasm affect hiv-1 pathogenesis well hiv-1
replication.
