the human papillomavirus e2 proteins key regulators viral life cycle, 
whose functions commonly mediated protein-protein interactions with
the host cell proteome. identified interaction e2 cellular
protein called cchcr1, proved highly specific hpv16 genotype, the
most prevalent hpv-associated cancers. characterization the
interaction revealed cchcr1 binds n-terminal alpha helices hpv16 e2
n-terminal domain. domain, cchcr1 binding interface overlaps 
brd4, key mediator e2 transcriptional activity. consequently physical
competition occurs two proteins binding hpv16 e2, and
cchcr1 interferes brd4-mediated enhancement e2-dependent transcription.
in addition, showed interaction cchcr1 induced massive
redistribution hpv16 e2, predominantly nuclear cytoplasmic
localization dot-like structures, e2 perfectly co-localizes cchcr1.
such cytoplasmic docking likely interferes nuclear functions hpv16 
e2. upon co-expression brd4 cchcr1, e2 accumulates nucleus and
in cytoplasm, indicating hpv16, sub-cellular localization and
transcriptional functions e2 may depend proportion factors
within cell. provided evidence strong induction keratinocyte
differentiation marker k10 hpv16 e2, showed activation is
compromised interaction cchcr1. specific interaction described
here could thus impact pathogenesis hpv16. propose could
underlie specific traits hpv16 infection, enhanced propensity 
to give rise lesions evolving toward cancer.
