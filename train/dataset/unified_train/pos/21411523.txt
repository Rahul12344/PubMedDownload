recent findings suggest addition role packaging genomic rna,
the west nile virus (wnv) capsid protein important pathogenic determinant, 
a scenario requires interaction viral protein host cell
proteins. performed extensive multitissue yeast two-hybrid screen to
identify capsid-binding proteins human cells. describe interaction
between wnv capsid nucleolar rna helicase ddx56/noh61.
coimmunoprecipitation confirmed capsid protein binds ddx56 infected
cells interaction dependent upon intact rna. interestingly, 
wnv infection induced relocalization ddx56 nucleolus a
compartment cytoplasm also contained capsid protein. phenomenon 
was apparently specific wnv, ddx56 remained nucleoli cells
infected rubella dengue 2 viruses. analyses showed ddx56 is
not required replication wnv; however, virions secreted from
ddx56-depleted cells contained less viral rna 100 times less infectious.
together, data suggest ddx56 required assembly infectious
wnv particles.
