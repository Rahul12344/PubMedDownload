recently, apobec3g identified host factor blocks retroviral
replication. introduces g hypermutations newly synthesized minus
strand viral cdna step reverse transcription target cells. here, 
identified human apobec3f protein another host factor blocks human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) replication. similar apobec3g, apobec3f 
also induced g hypermutations hiv genomic dna, viral vif protein 
counteracted activity. thus, apobec family members might evolved a
general defense mechanism body retroviruses, retrotransposons, and
other mobile genetic elements.
