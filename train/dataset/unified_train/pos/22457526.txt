we recently reported group human adenoviruses (hadvs) uses
desmoglein 2 (dsg2) receptor infection. among widely
distributed serotypes hadv-b3 hadv-b7, well newly emerged strain
derived hadv-b14. serotypes infect rodent cells could not
up studied small-animal models. therefore generated transgenic
mice containing human dsg2 locus. mice expressed human dsg2 (hdsg2) 
a level pattern similar found humans nonhuman primates.
as initial application hdsg2-transgenic mice, used green fluorescent
protein (gfp)-expressing hadv-b3 vector (ad3-gfp) studied gfp transgene
expression quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (qrt-pcr) and
immunohistochemistry subsequent intranasal intravenous virus application. 
after intranasal application, found efficient transduction bronchial and
alveolar epithelial cells hdsg2-transgenic mice. intravenous ad3-gfp injection
into hdsg2-transgenic mice resulted hdsg2-dependent transduction epithelial
cells intestinal colon mucosa. findings give explanation for
clinical symptoms associated infection dsg2-interacting hadvs provide
a rationale using ad3-derived vectors gene therapy.
