the high risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated carcinomas of
cervix genital tumors. previous studies identified two viral
oncoproteins e6 e7, expressed majority hpv-associated
carcinomas. ability high risk hpv e6 protein immortalize human mammary 
epithelial cells provided single gene model study mechanisms of
e6-induced oncogenic transformation. recent years, become clear in
addition e6-induced degradation p53 tumor suppressor protein, targets
of e6 required mammary epithelial cells immortalization. using yeast 
two-hybrid system, identified novel interaction hpv16 e6 with
protein kinase pkn, fatty acid- rho small g protein-activated
serine/threonine kinase catalytic domain highly homologous protein
kinase c. demonstrate direct binding high risk hpv e6 proteins pkn in
wheat-germ lysate vitro 293t cells vivo. importantly, e6 proteins of
high risk hpvs low risk hpvs able bind pkn. furthermore, 
immortalization-competent many immortalization-non-competent e6 mutants bind 
pkn. data suggest binding pkn may required sufficient
for immortalizing normal mammary epithelial cells. finally, show pkn
phosphorylates e6, demonstrating first time hpv e6 a
phosphoprotein. finding suggests novel link hpv e6 mediated
oncogenesis regulation well known phosphorylation cascade.
