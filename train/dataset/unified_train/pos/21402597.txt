the influenza virus rna polymerase synthesizes three types rna: genomic vrna, 
anti-genomic crna mrna. vrna crna bound viral rna
polymerase nucleoprotein form ribonucleoprotein complexes. viral mrnas are
also proposed bound rna polymerase prevent endonucleolytic 
cleavage, regulate splicing m1 mrna, facilitate translation. here, 
used standard immunoprecipitation, biochemical purification rna
immunoprecipitation assays investigate association viral host
factors viral mrna. found viral mrna associates viral
non-structural protein 1 (ns1), cellular poly(a)-binding protein 1 (pabp1), the
20 kda subunit ncbp1 nuclear cap-binding complex (cbc), rna export
factor-binding protein ref/aly translation initiation factor eif4e.
however, data suggest rna polymerase might form part the
viral messenger ribonucleoprotein (mrnp) complex. propose model which
viral mrnas, associating cellular cap-binding proteins, follow the
pathways normally used cellular mrnas splicing, nuclear export and
translation.
