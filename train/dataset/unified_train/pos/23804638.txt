adenoviruses (ads) promising vectors therapeutic interventions humans.
when injected bloodstream, ad vectors bind several vitamin
k-dependent blood coagulation factors, contributes virus sequestration
in liver facilitating transduction hepatocytes. although both
coagulation factors fvii fx bind hexon protein human ad serotype 5
(hadv5) high affinity, fx appears play role mediating
ad-hepatocyte transduction vivo. understand discrepancy between
efficacy fvii binding hexon apparently poor capacity supporting
virus cell entry, analyzed hadv5-fvii complex using high-resolution
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-em) followed molecular dynamic flexible fitting
(mdff) simulations. results indicate although hexon amino acids t423,
e424, t425, identified earlier critical fx binding, also involved 
in mediating binding fvii, fvii gla domain sits within surface-exposed
hexon trimer depression different orientation found fx.
furthermore, found bound hexon, two proximal fvii molecules
interact via serine protease (sp) domains bury potential heparan
sulfate proteoglycan (hspg) receptor binding residues within dimer interface.
in contrast, earlier cryo-em studies ad-fx interaction showed evidence 
of dimer formation. dimerization fvii bound ad may contributing
mechanistic factor differential infectivity ad-fx ad-fvii
complexes, despite high-affinity binding coagulation factors the
virus.
