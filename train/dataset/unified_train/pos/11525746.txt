in infected host, nef protein hiv/siv required high viral loads
and thus disease progression. recent evidence indicates nef enhances
replication cell compartment virus transmitted from
dendritic cells (dc). underlying mechanism, however, clear. here, we
report natural variability proline-rich motif (r71t) profoundly
modulated nef-stimulated viral replication primary cells immature
dendritic cell/t cell cocultures. whereas nef variants (r/t-nef)
downregulated cd4, isoform supporting viral replication (r-nef)
efficiently interacted signaling molecules cell receptor (tcr)
environment stimulated cellular activation. structural analysis suggested
that r conversion induces conformational changes, altering the
flexibility loop containing pxxp motif hence ability bind
cellular partners. report suggests functionally conformationally
distinct nef isoforms modulate hiv replication interaction level 
tcr-signaling environment virus enters cell compartment.
