human hepatitis b virus (hbv) satellite virus, hepatitis virus (hdv),
primarily infect humans, chimpanzees, tree shrews (tupaia belangeri). viral
infections species known mainly restricted entry level 
since viral replication achieved cells transfection viral
genome. sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (ntcp) functional
receptor hbv hdv, amino acids 157 165 ntcp critical for
viral entry likely limit viral infection macaques. however, molecular 
determinants viral entry restriction mouse ntcp (mntcp) remain unclear. in
this study, mntcp found unable support either hbv hdv infection, 
although bind pre-s1 hbv l protein functional transporting
substrate taurocholate; comprehensive swapping point mutations human ntcp 
(hntcp) mntcp revealed molecular determinants restricting mntcp viral
entry hbv hdv. remarkably, mntcp residues 84 87 substituted
by human counterparts, mntcp effectively support viral infections. in
addition, number cell lines, regardless species tissue origin,
supported hdv infection transfected hntcp mntcp residues 84 
87 replaced human counterparts, highlighting central role ntcp for
viral infections mediated hbv envelope proteins. studies advance our
understanding ntcp-mediated viral entry hbv hdv important
implications developing mouse model infections.
