adeno-associated virus (aav) parvovirus small single-stranded dna
genome relies cellular replication machinery together functions
supplied coinfecting helper viruses. impact host factors aav
infection well understood. explored connection aav helper
functions supplied adenovirus cellular dna repair proteins. adenoviral
e1b55k/e4orf6 proteins induce degradation cellular mre11 repair complex
(mrn) promote productive adenovirus infection. viral proteins also
augment recombinant aav transduction provide crucial helper functions for
wild-type aav replication. here, show mrn poses barrier aav that
the helper function provided e1b55k/e4orf6 involves mrn degradation. using a
fluorescent method visualize viral genome, show effect viral 
dna level. mrn components accumulate aav replication centers recognize the
viral inverted terminal repeats. together, data suggest aav targeted 
by mrn evolved exploit adenoviral proteins degrade cellular
factors.
