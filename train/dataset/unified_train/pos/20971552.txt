hbv x protein transactivator several cellular signaling pathways
including wnt contributes hbv associated neoplasia. wnt/β-catenin
pathway associated hcc-initiating cells. perform functional
screen host factors involved transactivational properties hbx. we
identify adenomatous polyposis coli (apc) binding partner hbx further
determine hbx competitively binds apc displace β-catenin its
degradation complex. results β-catenin upregulation nucleus and
the activation wnt signaling. show wnt inhibitors curcumin and
quercetin target downstream β-catenin activity effectively repress
hbx-mediated regulation c-myc e-cadherin. results provide a
pathological mechanism hbx induced malignant transformation.
