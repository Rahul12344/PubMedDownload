the human cytomegalovirus-encoded glycoproteins us2 us11 catalyse the
dislocation class major histocompatibility complex (mhc) products, resulting
in rapid degradation. show us11 uses transmembrane domain 
to recruit class mhc products human homologue yeast der1p, protein
essential degradation subset misfolded er proteins. show 
this protein, derlin-1, essential degradation class mhc molecules
catalysed us11, us2. conclude derlin-1 important
factor extraction certain aberrantly folded proteins the
