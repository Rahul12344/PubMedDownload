up now, little known hepatitis b virus core protein (hbc)
interactions host-cell proteins, although interactions might be
essential virus propagation pathogenicity. work, human liver
cdna library screened proteins interacting hbc. among several
hbc-interacting partners selected, interacted strongly human
protein gipc1. common protein interaction domain, pdz, identified the
region sufficient interaction hbc. core protein a
putative c-terminal pdz-interacting motif, sequence proved be
important interaction gipc1.
