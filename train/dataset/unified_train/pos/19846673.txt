hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection increasingly associated development
of hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). hcv thought directly oncogenic
but, modulating range cellular functions, may predispose patients 
development liver tumours. however, molecular mechanisms hcv
infection might contribute hcc remain characterized. regard, 
showed previously hcv ns5a protein bound p85 regulatory subunit
of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (pi3k), thereby stimulating activity p110
catalytic subunit enzyme. one downstream consequences was
the stabilization proto-oncogene, beta-catenin, concomitant
stimulation transcriptional activity. here, analyse the
mechanism ns5a mediates activation beta-catenin. although our
previous data consistent role pi3k downstream effector
kinases, akt glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, ns5a-mediated activation of
beta-catenin, demonstrate fact independent these
kinases. truncation analysis revealed n c termini ns5a are
required full activation beta-catenin. furthermore, demonstrate that
ns5a, either alone complex p85, able bind directly to
beta-catenin; n c termini contribute interaction. we
propose ns5a activates beta-catenin via novel mechanism involves a
direct interaction two proteins augmented pi3k activity.
this may contribute association chronic hcv infection the
development hcc.
