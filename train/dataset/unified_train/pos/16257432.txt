the human papillomavirus (hpv) e1--e4 protein detected cytoplasm of
differentiated keratinocytes, near cornified cell envelope. hpv not
induce lysis infected keratinocyte, normally durable cornified
cell envelope forms keratinocyte differentiation would seemingly
inhibit viral egress. hpv infection induces abnormalities cornified cell
envelope, exact mechanisms involved well understood. tested
whether hpv 11 e1--e4 protein, co-localizes cell envelope and
co-purifies cell envelope fragments, could serve vitro substrate
for transglutaminases. found evidence e1--e4 cross-linking endogenous
transglutaminases situ assay using frozen sections human foreskin,
and addition, e1--e4 protein cross-linked recombinant transglutaminase 
3 (but transglutaminase 1) vitro cross-linking assay. also tested
whether expression e1--e4 differentiated keratinocytes would induce
morphologic alterations cornified cell envelopes. differentiated keratinocytes
expressing e1--e4 disorganized pleomorphic compared control cells,
and cell envelopes purified e1--e4-expressing cells small, fragmented, 
and rough bordered compared round, smooth bordered cell envelopes from
control cells. conclude vitro experiments e1--e4
protein cross-linked transglutaminase 3, e1--e4 expression in
differentiated keratinocytes induces morphologic abnormalities cornified
cell envelope.
