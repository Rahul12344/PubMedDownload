hepatitis e virus (hev) causes acute self-limiting disease endemic 
developing countries. previous studies suggested orf3 protein (porf3) of
hev required infection vivo likely modulate host
response. previous work showed porf3 localizes early recycling
endosomes causes delay postinternalization trafficking epidermal 
growth factor receptor (egfr) late endosomes/lysosomes. report that
porf3 also delays trafficking degradation activated hepatocyte growth 
factor receptor (c-met) delineate mechanistic details effects. a
mutant orf3 protein, localize endosomes, also showed similar
effects growth factor receptor trafficking, making effect independent 
the endosomal localization porf3. orf3 protein found interact 
cin85, multidomain adaptor protein implicated cbl-mediated
downregulation receptor tyrosine kinases. interaction competed the
formation growth factor receptor-cbl-cin85 complex, resulting the
reduced ubiquitination cin85 trafficking growth factor receptor
complex toward late endosomes/lysosomes. propose effects on
growth factor receptor trafficking, porf3 prolongs endomembrane growth factor
signaling promotes cell survival contribute positively viral
replication pathogenesis.
