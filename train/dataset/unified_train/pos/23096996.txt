hepatitis c virus (hcv) encodes several proteins interfere host
cell signaling antiviral response. previously, serine protease ns3/4a was
shown block host cell interferon (ifn) production proteolytic cleavage of
mavs trif, adaptor molecules rig-i tlr3 signaling pathways,
respectively. study shows another hcv protease, ns2 interfere
efficiently cytokine gene expression. ns2 proteolytically inactive
mutant forms able inhibit type type iii ifn, ccl5 cxcl10 gene
promoters activated sendai virus infection. however, cxcl8 gene promoter
was inhibited ns2. addition, constitutively active rig-i (δrig-i),
mavs, trif, ikkε, tbk1-induced activation ifn-β promoter inhibited 
ns2. cotransfection experiments ikkε tbk1 together interferon
regulatory factor 3 (irf3) hcv expression constructs revealed ns2 a
dose-dependent manner inhibited ikkε especially tbk1-induced irf3
phosphorylation. gst pull-down experiments gst-ns2 vitro-translated
and cell-expressed ikkε tbk1 demonstrated direct physical interactions the
kinases ns2. evidence ikkε/tbk1 kinase complex the
target ns2 obtained observation constitutively active
form irf3 (irf3-5d) activated readily ifn-β promoter presence ns2.
the present study identified hcv ns2 potent interferon antagonist, and
describes explanation ns2 downregulates major signaling pathways
involved development host innate antiviral responses.
