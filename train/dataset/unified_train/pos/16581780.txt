hepatitis c virus (hcv) ns5b protein membrane-associated phosphoprotein that
possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase activity. recently reported that
ns5a protein interacts traf2 modulates tumor necrosis factor alpha
(tnf-alpha)-induced nf-kappab jun n-terminal protein kinase (jnk). since ns5a
and ns5b essential components hcv replication complex, examined
whether ns5b could modulate tnf-alpha-induced nf-kappab jnk activation. in
this study, demonstrated tnf-alpha-induced nf-kappab activation is
inhibited ns5b protein hek293 hepatic cells. furthermore, ns5b protein 
inhibited traf2- ikk-induced nf-kappab activation. using
coimmunoprecipitation assays, show ns5b interacts ikkalpha. most
importantly, ns5b protein hcv subgenomic replicon cells interacted with
endogenous ikkalpha, tnf-alpha-mediated ikkalpha kinase activation was
significantly decreased ns5b. using vitro kinase assay, further
found ns5b protein synergistically activated tnf-alpha-mediated jnk activity
in hek293 hepatic cells. data suggest ns5b protein modulates
tnf-alpha signaling pathways may contribute hcv pathogenesis.
