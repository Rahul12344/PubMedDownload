coxsackievirus b3 (cvb3) common factor human myocarditis. apoptotic
events present cvb3-induced disease, unclear cvb3 is
involved apoptosis viral proteins may induce apoptotic pathway. 
in report demonstrate human murine proapoptotic protein siva
specifically interact cvb3 capsid protein vp2. furthermore, the
transcription siva strongly induced tissue cvb3-infected mice 
present area positively stained apoptosis, cd27, and
cd70. proposed siva involved cd27/cd70-transduced
apoptosis. therefore, suggest molecular mechanism apoptotic
events contributes cvb3-caused pathogenesis.
