the high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated carcinomas the
cervix genital tumors. previous studies identified two viral
oncoproteins, e6 e7, expressed majority hpv-associated
carcinomas. ability high-risk hpv e6 protein immortalize human mammary 
epithelial cells (mecs) provided single-gene model study mechanisms 
of e6-induced oncogenic transformation. system, e6 protein targets
the p53 tumor suppressor protein degradation, mutational analyses have
shown e6-induced degradation p53 protein required mec
immortalization. however, inability dominant-negative p53 mutants 
induce efficient immortalization mecs suggests existence additional
targets hpv e6 oncoprotein. using yeast two-hybrid system, have
isolated novel e6-binding protein. polypeptide, designated e6tp1
(e6-targeted protein 1), exhibits high homology gtpase-activating proteins for
rap, including spa-1, tuberin, rap1gap. mrna e6tp1 widely
expressed tissues vitro-cultured cell lines. gene e6tp1
localizes chromosome 14q23.2-14q24.3 within locus shown to
undergo loss heterozygosity malignant meningiomas. importantly, e6tp1 is
targeted degradation high-risk low-risk hpv e6 proteins
both vitro vivo. furthermore, immortalization-competent the
immortalization-incompetent hpv16 e6 mutants target e6tp1 protein for
degradation. results identify novel target e6 oncoprotein and
provide potential link hpv e6 oncogenesis alteration small g
protein signaling pathway.
