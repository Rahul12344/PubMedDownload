high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) associated carcinomas the
cervix genital tumors. hpv oncoprotein e6 essential for
oncogenic transformation. identify hada3, human homologue yeast
transcriptional coactivator yada3, novel e6-interacting protein target
of e6-induced degradation. hada3 binds selectively high-risk hpv e6
proteins immortalization-competent e6 mutants. hada3 functions a
coactivator p53-mediated transactivation stabilizing p53 protein. notably,
three immortalizing e6 mutants induce direct p53 degradation do
interact hada3 induced abrogation p53-mediated transactivation and
g(1) cell cycle arrest dna damage, comparable wild-type e6. these
findings reveal novel strategy hpv e6-induced loss p53 function is
independent direct p53 degradation. given likely role the
evolutionarily conserved hada3 multiple coactivator complexes, inactivation of
its function may allow e6 perturb numerous cellular pathways hpv
oncogenesis.
