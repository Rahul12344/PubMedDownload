we performed yeast two-hybrid screening human kidney cell cdna library to
study biological role hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (np). found
that seoul virus (seov) hantaan virus (htnv) nps associated small
ubiquitin-like modifier (sumo)-1-interacting proteins pias1, piasxbeta, hipk2,
chd3, ttrap, interacted sumo-1 conjugating enzyme (ubc-9) 
sumo-1 yeast two-hybrid assay. interactions hipk2, chd3, and
ttrap proteins seov np also shown mammalian two-hybrid assay.
however, interaction pias proteins np, was
probably due inhibitory effect pias transcription mammalian
two-hybrid assay. nevertheless, co-expression experiment suggested the
existence pias-np interaction cytoplasm. region spanning amino
acids 100-125 seov np, represents critical region np-np
polymerization, found responsible interaction with
sumo-1-related molecules yeast mammalian two-hybrid assays. these
results add information interactions hantavirus np host cellular
proteins.
