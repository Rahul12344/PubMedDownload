protein old world arenavirus lassa virus (lasv) interacts kinesin
family member 13a (kif13a), plus-end-directed microtubule-dependent motor
protein. plasmid-driven overexpression kif13a results relocalization z
to cell periphery, functional blockage endogenous kif13a by
overexpression dominant-negative mutant kif13a-specific sirna causes a
perinuclearaccumulation decreased production z-induced virus-like

both old new world arenaviruses suggests conserved intracellular transport 
mechanism. contrast, intracellular distribution matrix proteins 
prototypic members paramyxo- rhabdovirus family independent of
kif13a. summary, studies identify first time molecular motor
protein critical mediator intracellular microtubule-dependent transport 
of arenavirus matrix proteins.
