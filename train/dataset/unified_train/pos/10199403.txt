the nef protein primate lentiviruses downregulates cell surface expression
of cd4 two-step process. first, nef connects cytoplasmic tail of
cd4 adaptor protein complexes (ap), thereby inducing formation of
cd4-specific clathrin-coated pits rapidly endocytose viral receptor.
second, nef targets internalized cd4 molecules degradation. show that
nef accomplishes second task acting connector cd4 the
beta subunit copi coatomers endosomes. sequence encompassing critical
acidic dipeptide, located nearby distinct ap-binding determinant 
hiv-1 nef, responsible beta-cop recruitment routing lysosomes. 
a novel class endosomal sorting motif, based acidic residues, thus
revealed, beta-cop identified downstream partner.
