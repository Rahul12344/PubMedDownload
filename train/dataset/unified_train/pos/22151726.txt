the human papillomavirus (hpv) l2 capsid protein plays essential role during
the early stages viral infection, molecular mechanisms underlying 
mode action remain obscure. using proteomic approach, identified the
adaptor protein, sorting nexin 17 (snx17) strong interacting partner hpv 
l2. interaction occurs highly conserved snx17 consensus binding
motif, present majority hpv l2 proteins analysed. using
mutants l2 defective snx17 interaction, sirna ablation snx17
expression, demonstrate interaction l2 snx17 essential
for viral infection. furthermore, loss l2-snx17 interaction results in
enhanced turnover l2 protein decreased stability viral capsids,
and concomitantly, dramatic decrease efficiency which
viral genomes transit nucleus. indeed, using range endosomal and
lysosomal markers, show capsids defective capacity bind snx17
transit much rapidly lysosomal compartment. results demonstrate
that l2-snx17 interaction essential viral infection facilitates
the escape l2-dna complex late endosomal/lysosomal compartments.
