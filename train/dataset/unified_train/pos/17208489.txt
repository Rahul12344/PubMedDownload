although neural cell adhesion molecule (ncam) -140 -180 shown
to serve receptor rabies virus (rv), known whether 
major isoform ncam, gpi-anchored ncam-120 functions rv receptor. this
study, established hep-2 cells stably expressing ncam-120 ncam-140,
and susceptibilities rv infection compared. results
demonstrated ncam-120 served virus attachment protein; however, cells
expressing ncam-120 support efficient rv replication. furthermore, the
level ifn-ss mrna apparently elevated ncam-120 expressing cells not
in ncam-140 expressing cells, suggesting gpi-anchored ncam-120 suppressed rv
replication via induction ifn-ss even though ncam-120 able promote
virus penetration cells.
