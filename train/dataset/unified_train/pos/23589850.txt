vesicular stomatitis virus (vsv) exhibits remarkably robust pantropic
infectivity, mediated coat protein, vsv-g. using property,
recombinant forms vsv vsv-g-pseudotyped viral vectors developed 
for gene therapy, vaccination, viral oncolysis extensively used for
gene transduction vivo vitro. broad tropism vsv suggests it
enters cells highly ubiquitous receptor, whose identity far
remained elusive. show ldl receptor (ldlr) serves major
entry port vsv vsv-g-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors human mouse 
cells, whereas ldlr family members serve alternative receptors. the
widespread expression ldlr family members accounts pantropism vsv
and broad applicability vsv-g-pseudotyped viral vectors gene
transduction.
