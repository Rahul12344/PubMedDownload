in study, used immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry identify
over 50 cellular viral proteins associated herpes simplex
virus 1 (hsv-1) icp8 single-stranded dna-binding protein. many the
coprecipitating cellular proteins known members large cellular complexes
involved (i) dna replication damage repair, including rpa msh6; (ii)
nonhomologous homologous recombination, including catalytic subunit of
the dna-dependent protein kinase, ku86, rad50; (iii) chromatin
remodeling, including brg1, brm, hsnf2h, baf155, msin3a, histone deacetylase 
2. appears dna mediates association certain proteins icp8,
while direct protein-protein interactions mediate association other
proteins. number proteins accumulate viral replication compartments
in infected cell nucleus, indicating proteins may role in
viral replication. wrn, functions cellular recombination pathways via
its helicase exonuclease activities, absolutely required viral
replication, viral yields slightly, all, decreased in
wrn-deficient human primary fibroblasts compared control cells. in
ku70-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts, viral yields increased almost
50-fold, suggesting cellular nonhomologous end-joining pathway inhibits 
hsv replication. hypothesize proteins coprecipitating with
icp8 involved hsv replication may give new insight viral
replication mechanisms.
