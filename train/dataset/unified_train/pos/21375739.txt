background: hepatitis b virus (hbv) infections play important role the
development hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). hbv x protein (hbx) a
multifunctional protein modulate various cellular processes plays 
crucial role pathogenesis hcc. hbx known interact dna
helicase components tfiih, basal transcriptional factor integral
component dna excision repair.
results: study, functional relevance association 
investigated context dna repair. site-directed mutagenesis hbx's
critical residues interaction tfiih identified. similarly, tfiih
mutants lacking atpase domain conserved carboxyl-terminal domain failed
to interact hbx. yeast mammalian cells expressing hbx(wt) conferred
hypersensitivity uv irradiation, interpreted basic deficiency in
nucleotide excision repair. hbx(mut120) (glu val) defective binding 
tfiih failed respond uv.
conclusions: conclude hbx may act promoting factor inhibiting
dna repair causing dna damage accumulation errors, thereby contributing to
hcc development.
