bovine herpesvirus 1 (bhv-1) infection induces clinical symptoms upper
respiratory tract, inhibits immune responses, result life-threatening 
secondary bacterial infections. following acute infection, bhv-1 establishes
latency sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia. periodically, reactivation 
from latency occurs, resulting virus transmission. latency-related (lr)
rna abundantly expressed latently infected sensory neurons, suggesting that
lr gene products regulate latency-reactivation cycle. lr mutant virus with
stop codons amino terminus first open reading frame (orf) lr
gene (orf2) reactivate latency, part induces higher
levels apoptosis infected neurons. orf2 inhibits apoptosis transiently
transfected cells, suggesting plays important role the
latency-reactivation cycle. orf2 also interacts notch1 notch3 and
consequently inhibits ability trans-activate bicp0 early and
glycoprotein c promoters. study, identified orf2 sequences were
necessary inhibiting cold shock-induced apoptosis notch1-mediated
trans-activation bicp0 early promoter stimulation productive
infection. relative orf2 sequences necessary inhibiting apoptosis,
distinct domains orf2 important interfering notch1-mediated
trans-activation. five consensus protein kinase and/or protein kinase c
phosphorylation sites within orf2 regulate steady-state levels orf2 in
transfected cells. nuclear localization signal orf2 necessary for
inhibiting notch1-mediated trans-activation apoptosis. summary, orf2
has one functional domain regulates stability functional
properties.
