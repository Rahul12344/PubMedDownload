ross river (rr) virus alphavirus endemic australia new guinea is
the aetiological agent epidemic polyarthritis rr virus disease. we
provide evidence rr virus uses collagen-binding alpha1beta1 integrin 
a cellular receptor. infection could inhibited collagen iv antibodies
specific beta1 alpha1 integrin proteins, fibroblasts from
alpha1-integrin-/- mice less efficiently infected wild-type
fibroblasts. soluble alpha1beta1 integrin bound immobilized rr virus, and
peptides representing alpha1beta1 integrin binding-site collagen iv
inhibited virus binding cells. speculate two highly conserved regions 
within cell-receptor binding domain e2 mimic collagen provide access
to cellular collagen-binding receptors.
