human papillomaviruses (hpv) infect keratinocytes skin mucosa. persistent 
infection lead formation benign tumors. cases high-risk hpv, 
such hpv16 18, may progress cancer. order support
viral replication suprabasal keratinocytes, hpv e7 protein employs various
strategies keep keratinocytes cycle counteracts anti-proliferative
signals outside. hpv16 e7 directly interfere transforming growth
factor-beta (tgf-beta) signalling binding smad proteins mediating growth
arrest. speculated property hpv16 e7 contributes to
hpv-associated carcinogenesis. here, show e7 proteins different low-
and high-risk hpv types bind smad 1 4. e7 protein hpv1, low-risk
hpv causing plantar warts, efficiently inhibited smad 3-induced transcription.
our data strongly indicate smad-binding capacity e7 proteins from
different hpvs may preserve keratinocyte proliferation required the
productive viral life cycle rather promoting carcinogenesis.
