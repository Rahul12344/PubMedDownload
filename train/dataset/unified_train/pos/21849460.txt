the influenza virus ns1 protein contains conserved 4-amino-acid-residue
pdz-ligand binding motif (pbm) carboxyl terminus function a
virulence determinant targeting cellular pdz proteins. ns1 proteins from
avian human viral isolates consensus pbm sequences esev rskv,
respectively. currently circulating highly pathogenic h5n1 viruses contain the
esev pbm specifically associates pdz proteins scribble, dlg1,
magi-1, magi-2, magi-3. study, found ns1 proteins viral
isolates contain pbm sequence rskv, ksev, epev unable to
associate pdz proteins. results showed esev pbm
mediates indirect association pdz protein, lin7c, via interaction with
dlg1. infection virus expresses ns1 protein esev pbm
results colocalization ns1, scribble, dlg1 within perinuclear puncta
and mislocalization plasma membrane-associated lin7c cytoplasm.
infection polarized mdck cells esev virus additionally results in
functional disruption tight junction (tj) measured altered
localization tj markers zo-1 occludin, decreased transepithelial
electrical resistance, increased fluorescein isothiocyanate (fitc)-inulin
diffusion across polarized cell monolayer. similar effect tj was
observed mdck cells depleted either scribble dlg1 small interfering 
rna (sirna). findings indicate esev pbm-mediated binding ns1 to
scribble dlg1 functions disrupt cellular tj effect
likely contributes severe disease associated highly pathogenic h5n1
influenza viruses.
