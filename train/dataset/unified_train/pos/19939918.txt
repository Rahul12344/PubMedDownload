replication transcription activator (rta) encoded open reading frame 50
(orf50) kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) essential and
sufficient initiate lytic reactivation. rta activates target genes through
direct binding high affinity responsive elements interaction
with cellular factors, rbp-jkappa, ap-1, c/ebp-alpha, oct-1. 
study, identified transducin-like enhancer split 2 (tle2) novel rta
binding protein using yeast two-hybrid screening human spleen cdna
library. interaction tle2 rta confirmed glutathione
s-transferase (gst) binding coimmunoprecipitation assays. immunofluorescence 
analysis showed tle2 rta colocalized nuclear
compartment kshv-infected cells. interaction recruited tle2 rta bound 
to recognition sites dna repressed rta auto-activation and
transactivation activity. moreover, tle2 also inhibited induction lytic
replication virion production driven rta. showed q
(gln-rich), sp (ser-pro-rich), wdr (trp-asp repeat) domains tle2 the
pro-rich domain rta essential interaction. rbp-jkappa been
shown previously bind pro-rich domain rta, binding can
be subject competition tle2. addition, tle2 form complex rta 
to access cognate dna sequence rta-responsive element different
promoters. intriguingly, transcription level tle2 could upregulated 
rta lytic reactivation process. conclusion, identified new rta
binding protein, tle2, demonstrated tle2 inhibited replication and
transactivation mediated rta. provides another potentially important
mechanism maintenance kshv viral latency interaction host
protein.
