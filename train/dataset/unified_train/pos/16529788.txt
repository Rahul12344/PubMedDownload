previously, others shown ccaat displacement protein (cdp)
negatively regulates papillomavirus promoters. overexpression cdp been
shown inhibit high-risk human papillomavirus virus (hpv) bovine
papillomavirus dna replication vivo presumably reduction expression
of viral replication proteins, e1 e2. sequence analysis hpv origin
indicates several potential cdp-binding sites one site overlapping the
e1-binding site. therefore, cdp could also negatively regulate papillomavirus
replication directly preventing loading initiation complex. show
here purified cdp inhibits vitro hpv dna replication. footprint analysis 
demonstrated cdp binds e1-binding site tata box, the
binding purified cdp e1-binding site decreased addition of
purified e2 protein. consistent this, e2-independent vitro hpv
replication inhibited cdp greater extent e2-dependent
replication. results suggest binding e2 e2-binding site may 
play important role overcoming inhibition e1 initiation complex
formation caused binding negative regulators like cdp origin 
replication.
