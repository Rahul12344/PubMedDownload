translation initiation hepatitis c virus rna occurs via ribosome binding an
'internal ribosome entry site (ires)' located 5'untranslated region the
viral rna. principle interaction 40s ribosomal subunit the
hcv ires shown largely factor independent, followed by
the joining 60s ribosomal subunit form functional 80s complex. however 
several additional cellular proteins reported bind hcv ires and
enhance initiation translation. order identify novel factors
involved ribosome assembly internal initiation hcv rna,
northwestern screening hela cdna expression library performed, using hcv
ires rna probe. demonstrate here, human ribosomal protein l18a, a
constituent 60s subunit, interacts hcv ires rna. interaction was
further confirmed using recombinant protein similar l18a (sl18a), cloned 
from human blood. interestingly, addition increasing concentration the
purified recombinant sl18a protein, showed moderate stimulation hcv ires
activity vitro translation assay. observations suggest the
human l18a might influence hcv ires mediated translation.
