the retinoic acid-inducible gene product (rig-i) identified a
cellular sensor rna virus infection resulting beta interferon (ifn-beta)
induction. however, many viruses known encode viral products inhibit 
ifn-beta production. case influenza virus, viral nonstructural
protein 1 (ns1) prevents induction ifn-beta promoter inhibiting the
activation transcription factors, including irf-3, involved ifn-beta
transcriptional activation. inhibitory properties ns1 appear due 
least part binding double-stranded rna (dsrna), resulting the
sequestration viral mediator rig-i activation. however, precise
effects ns1 rig-i-mediated induction ifn-beta been
characterized. report ns1 influenza virus interacts with
rig-i inhibits rig-i-mediated induction ifn-beta. inhibition 
apparent even mutant rig-i constitutively activated (in the
absence dsrna) used trigger ifn-beta production. coexpression rig-i,
its downstream signaling partner, ips-1, ns1 resulted increased levels 
rig-i ns1 within ips-1-rich, solubilization-resistant fraction cell 
lysis. results suggest rig-i, ips-1, ns1 become part same
complex. consistent idea, ns1 also found inhibit ifn-beta
promoter activation ips-1 overexpression. results indicate that, in
addition sequestering dsrna, ns1 influenza virus binds rig-i and
inhibits downstream activation irf-3, preventing transcriptional induction
of ifn-beta.
