infection viruses alter cellular mrna processing favor viral
gene expression. present evidence herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) protein 
icp27, contributes host shut-off inhibiting pre-mrna splicing,
interacts essential splicing factors termed sr proteins affects their
phosphorylation. hsv-1 infection, phosphorylation several sr proteins
was reduced correlated subnuclear redistribution. exogenous sr
proteins restored splicing icp27-inhibited nuclear extracts sr proteins
isolated hsv-1-infected cells activated splicing uninfected s100
extracts, indicating inhibition occurs reversible mechanism.
spliceosome assembly blocked pre-spliceosomal complex stage.
furthermore, show icp27 interacts srpk1 relocalizes the
nucleus; moreover, srpk1 activity altered presence icp27 vitro. 
we propose icp27 modifies srpk1 activity resulting hypophosphorylation of
sr proteins impairing ability function spliceosome assembly.
