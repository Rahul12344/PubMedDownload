nonstructural protein 1 (ns1) non-structural protein avian influenza
virus. interact variety proteins host cells, enhancing
the expression viral proteins changing growth metabolism the
host cells, thereby enhancing virus' pathogenicity virulence. to
investigate whether host proteins interact ns1
during viral infection, t7-phage display system used screen human lung
cell cdna library proteins could interact ns1. one positive and
specific clone obtained identified nucleolar coiled-body
phosphoprotein 1(nolc1). interaction two proteins further
demonstrated his-pull-down co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
co-expression proteins hela cell showed ns1 nolc1 were
co-localized cell's nucleus. gene truncation experiments revealed the
effector domain ns1 sufficient interact nolc1. results
demonstrated positive interaction viral ns1 nolc1 host
cells, provided new target drug screening.
