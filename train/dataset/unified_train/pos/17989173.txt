accumulating evidence indicates human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) 
acquires various cellular membrane proteins lipid bilayer viral
envelope membrane. although virion-incorporated cellular membrane proteins
are known potently affect hiv-1 infectivity, virological functions most
virion-incorporated membrane proteins remain unclear. among host proteins, 
we found cd63 eliminated plasma membranes hiv-1-producing 
cells activation, followed decrease amount of
virion-incorporated cd63, contrast, increase infectivity 
released virions. hand, found cd63 cell surface was
preferentially embedded membrane released virions hiv-1 envelope 
protein (env)-independent manner virion-incorporated cd63 the
potential inhibit hiv-1 env-mediated infection strain-specific manner 
the postattachment entry step(s). addition, behaviors commonly
observed tetraspanin proteins, cd9, cd81, cd82, cd231.
however, l6 protein, whose topology similar tetraspanins 
does belong tetraspanin superfamily, potential to
prevent hiv-1 infection, despite successful incorporation released
particles. taken together, results suggest tetraspanin proteins have
the unique potential modulate hiv-1 infectivity incorporation into
released hiv-1 particles, findings may provide clue undiscovered
aspects hiv-1 entry.
