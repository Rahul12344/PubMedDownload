hepatitis c virus (hcv) single-stranded rna virus replicates on
endoplasmic reticulum-derived membranes. hcv particle assembly dependent on
the association core protein cellular lipid droplets (lds). however, it
remains uncertain whether hcv assembly occurs ld membrane at
closely associated er membranes. furthermore, known hcv
replication complex progeny genomes physically associate presumed
sites virion assembly near lds. using unbiased proteomic strategy, we
have found rab18 interacts hcv nonstructural protein ns5a. rab18
associates lds believed promote physical interaction lds
and er membranes. active (gtp-bound) forms rab18 bind strongly ns5a
than constitutively gdp-bound mutant. ns5a colocalizes rab18-positive lds 
in hcv-infected cells, rab18 appears promote physical association of
ns5a replicase components lds. modulation rab18 affects genome 
replication possibly also production infectious virions. results
support model specific interactions viral cellular
proteins may promote physical interaction membranous hcv replication 
foci lipid droplets.
