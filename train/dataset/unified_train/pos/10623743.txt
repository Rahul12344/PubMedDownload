papillomavirus e6 oncoproteins transform mammalian cells interaction with
cellular proteins. bovine papillomavirus type 1 e6 (be6) interacts three
previously described cellular targets: e6ap e3 ubiquitin ligase, the
calcium-binding protein e6bp (also known erc-55), paxillin, a
focal adhesion adapter protein. be6 interacts strongly these
proteins vitro, binding similar peptide sequences found e6ap, e6bp, 
paxillin. determine be6 interactions necessary transformation by
be6, used novel selection strategy temperature-sensitive be6 mutants 
yeast could discriminate interaction e6ap, e6bp, and
paxillin. be6 mutants retained transforming ability retained association
with paxillin, mutants transformation positive failed to
interact e6ap e6bp. study demonstrates oncogene mutants that
are temperature sensitive transformation selected yeast that
the induction anchorage-independent cell proliferation be6 require
strong association be6 either e6ap e6bp. particular interest the
identification be6 mutant interacts strongly acidic charged
leucine motifs e6ap, e6bp, paxillin devoid transformation
activity, thereby genetically identifying second essential transformation
function be6 independent interaction acidic charged leucine
motifs.
