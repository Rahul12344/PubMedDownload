human immunodeficiency virus type 1 vpr virion-associated accessory protein 
that multiple activities within infected cell. one dramatic
effects vpr induction cell cycle arrest g(2)/m boundary,
followed apoptosis. effect implications cd4(+) cell loss aids.
in normal cell cycle regulation, wee1, key regulator g(2)-m progression,
phosphorylates tyr15 cdc2 thereby blocks progression cells m
phase. demonstrate vpr physically interacts wee1 n lobe of
the kinase domain analogous present kinases. interaction
with vpr enhances wee1 kinase activity cdc2. overexpression wee1
kinase-deficient mutants competes vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest, and
deletion region wee1 binds vpr abrogates competition.
however, vpr mutants i74p i81p, fail induce g(2) arrest, can
bind increase kinase activity wee1 extent wild-type 
vpr. therefore, conclude binding vpr wee1 sufficient for
vpr activate g(2) checkpoint, may reflect independent function
of vpr.
