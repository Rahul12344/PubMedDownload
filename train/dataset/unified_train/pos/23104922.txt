the establishment latent reservoir human tumor viruses vital step in
initiating cellular transformation represents major shortcoming current 
therapeutic strategies ability eradicate virus-infected cells. human
t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) establishes lifelong infection is
linked adult t-cell leukemia lymphoma (atll). here, demonstrate htlv-1
p30 recruits cellular proteasome activator pa28γ onto viral tax/rex mrna 
to prevent nuclear export suppress virus replication. interaction p30 
with pa28γ retaining fully functional proteasome activity required p30's
ability repress htlv-1. consistently, htlv-1 molecular clones replicate better
and produce virus particles pa28γ-deficient cells. results define a
unique novel role cellular factor pa28γ control nuclear rna
trafficking htlv-1–induced latency. importantly, knockdown pa28γ
expression atll cells latently infected htlv-1 reactivates expression 
viral tax/rex rna tax protein. tax immunogenic viral 
antigen triggers strong ctl responses, results suggest that
pa28γ-targeted therapy may reactivate virus expression latently infected
cells allow eradication host.key points: pa28γ acts a
co-repressor htlv-1 p30 suppress virus replication required 
maintenance viral latency. htlv-1 evolved unique function mediated by
its posttranscriptional repressor p30, found htlv-2.
