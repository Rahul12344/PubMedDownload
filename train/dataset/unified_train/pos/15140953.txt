the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) u(l)31 u(l)34 proteins dependent 
on proper targeting nuclear membrane required for
efficient envelopment nucleocapsids inner nuclear membrane. this
work, show whereas solubility lamins c (lamin a/c) not
markedly increased, hsv induced conformational changes nuclear lamina of
infected cells, viewed staining three different lamin a/c-specific 
antibodies. one case, reactivity monoclonal antibody recognizes an
epitope lamin tail domain greatly reduced hsv-infected cells. 
apparent hsv-induced epitope masking required u(l)31 u(l)34, these
proteins sufficient mask epitope uninfected cells, indicating 
that hsv proteins also required. second case, staining a
rabbit polyclonal antibody primarily recognizes epitopes lamin a/c
rod domain revealed u(l)34 required hsv-induced decreased
availability epitopes reaction antibody, whereas u(l)31 protein
was dispensable effect. still another polyclonal antibody indicated
virtually difference lamin a/c staining infected versus uninfected
cells, indicating hsv-induced changes conformational the
result lamin depletion nuclear rim. evidence supporting an
interaction nuclear lamina u(l)31/u(l)34 protein complex
includes observations (i) overexpression u(l)31 protein in
uninfected cells sufficient relocalize lamin a/c nuclear rim into
nucleoplasmic aggregates, (ii) overexpression u(l)34 sufficient to
relocalize lamin a/c cytoplasm, (iii) u(l)31 u(l)34
could directly bind lamin a/c vitro. studies suggest u(l)31 and
u(l)34 proteins modify conformation nuclear lamina infected cells, 
possibly direct interaction lamin a/c, proteins also
likely involved. given nuclear lamina potentially excludes nucleocapsids
from envelopment sites inner nuclear membrane, lamina alteration may
reflect role u(l)31/u(l)34 protein complex perturbing lamina to
promote nucleocapsid egress nucleus. alternatively, data are
compatible role lamina targeting u(l)31/u(l)34 protein
complex nuclear membrane.
