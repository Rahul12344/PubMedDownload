arenaviruses hantaviruses cause severe human disease. little known
regarding host proteins required propagation. identified human
proteins interact glycoproteins (gps) prototypic arenavirus
and hantavirus show lectin endoplasmic reticulum (er)-golgi
intermediate compartment 53 kda protein (ergic-53), cargo receptor required for
glycoprotein trafficking within early exocytic pathway, associates with
arenavirus, hantavirus, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus, filovirus gps. ergic-53 
binds arenavirus gps lectin-independent mechanism, traffics to
arenavirus budding sites, incorporated virions. ergic-53 required 
for arenavirus, coronavirus, filovirus propagation; absence,
gp-containing virus particles form noninfectious, due part their
inability attach host cells. thus, identified class of
pathogen-derived ergic-53 ligands, lectin-independent basis their
association ergic-53, role ergic-53 propagation several 
highly pathogenic rna virus families.
