during late phase human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1)
replication cycle, viral gag proteins intact rna genome trafficked to
specific sub-cellular membranes virus assembly budding occurs.
targeting plasma membranes cells macrophages mediated by
interactions n-terminal matrix (ma) domain gag cellular
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [pi(4,5)p(2)] molecules. however, in
macrophages dendritic cells, subset gag proteins appears targeted 
to tetraspanin enriched viral compartments, process appears mediated
by interactions delta subunit cellular adaptor protein ap-3
(ap-3δ). cloned, overexpressed purified protein interactive domain 
ap-3δ probed binding nmr. unexpectedly, evidence binding 
observed vitro experiments, even relatively high protein
concentrations (200μm), suggesting ap-3δ plays alternative role hiv-1 
assembly.
