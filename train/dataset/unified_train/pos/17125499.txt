background: despite continuous shedding hiv infected blood oral
cavity detectable presence aids virus high frequency, human
saliva reported inhibit oral transmission hiv kissing, dental
treatment, biting, aerosolization. purpose study purify
salivary muc5b muc7 mucins crude saliva determine anti-hiv-1
activities.
methods: following sepharose cl-4b column chromatography caesium chloride
isopycnic density-gradient ultra-centrifugation, purity identity the
mucins determined sds-page western blotting analysis respectively.
subsequently hiv-1 inhibition assay carried determine the
anti-hiv-1 activity crude saliva purified salivary mucins by
incubating subtype hiv-1 prior infection cd4+ cem ss cells.
results: western blotting analysis confirmed mucin void volume is
muc5b mucin included volume muc7. hiv inhibition assay
revealed crude saliva salivary muc5b muc7 mucins inhibited 
hiv-1 activity 100%.
conclusion: although mechanism action clear carbohydrate
moieties salivary mucins may trap aggregate virus prevent host 
cell entry.
