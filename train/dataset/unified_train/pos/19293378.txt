current knowledge suggests balance life death within cell 
can controlled stable engagement bcl-2-related proapoptotic proteins
such bak, bax, bim survival proteins bcl-2. bhrf1 a
prosurvival molecule epstein-barr virus high degree homology
to bcl-2. understand bhrf1 blocks apoptosis, bhrf1 mutants bhrf1
were expressed primary cells il-2-dependent cell line. bhrf1 bound
the executioner bak and, cells cultured without cytokines, bhrf1
associated bim. point mutation lost ability bind bak retained 
its ability bind bim protect cells. result demonstrated it
was capacity bhrf1 bind bim, bak, provided protection.
interestingly, amount bim bound bhrf1 minimal compared with
the amount bim induced apoptosis. thus, bhrf1 act simply
absorbing excess bim produced cells prepare death. rather, bhrf1
may act either binding preferentially lethal form bim acting
catalytically bim block apoptosis.
