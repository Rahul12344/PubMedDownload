open reading frame 74 (orf74) many gamma(2)-herpesviruses encodes cxc
chemokine receptor. molecular pharmacological profile orf74 from
herpesvirus saimiri, ecrf3, characterized compared the
well known orf74 human herpesvirus 8 (hhv8). ecrf3 receptor bound the
so-called elr (glu-leu-arg) cxc chemokines (125)i-cxcl1/gro alpha,
(125)i-cxcl6/gcp-2, (125)i-cxcl8/interleukin-8 high affinity; in
contrast orf74 hhv8, bind non-elr cxc chemokine
(125)i-cxcl10/ip10. interestingly, b(max) value cxcl6/gcp-2 3-fold
higher capacity maximal binding cxcl1/gro alpha ecrf3 and
85-fold higher cxcl8/interleukin-8, despite similar affinities. like
orf74 hhv8, ecrf3 activated broad range pathways (g(q), g(i), and
g(12/13) well camp response element-binding protein, nf-kappa b, nfat, 
and serum response element transcription factors) ligand-regulated manner,
with cxcl6/gcp-2 potent efficacious agonist. ecrf3 signaled
constitutively g(i) g(12/13), surprisingly g(q). at
the level transcription factor activation, serum response element was
activated constitutively ecrf3, whereas camp response element-binding protein,
nfat, nf-kappa b ligand-regulated. maximal signaling capacities
were similar two receptors; however, ligand-regulated signaling was
responsible major part total ecrf3 signaling minor 
part total hhv8 orf74 signaling. activation pattern ecrf3 with
constitutive activation (but all) employed pathways not
been seen endogenous virus-encoded chemokine receptors. results 
suggest unique ligand selectivity ecrf3 among orf74 receptors could
reflect differences cellular tropism gamma(2)-herpesviruses.
