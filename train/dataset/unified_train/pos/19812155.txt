our previous work shown efficient evasion type interferon
responses human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) requires expression 72-kda
immediate-early 1 (ie1) protein. suggested ie1 inhibits
interferon signaling intranuclear sequestration signal transducer 
and activator transcription 2 (stat2) protein. show physical
association subnuclear colocalization ie1 stat2 depend short acidic
and serine/proline-rich low-complexity motifs carboxy-terminal region of
the 491-amino-acid viral polypeptide. motifs compose essential core
(amino acids 373 420) adjacent ancillary site (amino acids 421 445) 
for stat2 interaction predicted form part natively unstructured 
domain. presence presumably "disordered" carboxy-terminal domains enriched
in low-complexity motifs evolutionarily highly conserved across examined
mammalian ie1 orthologs, murine cytomegalovirus ie1 protein appears to
interact stat2 like human counterpart. recombinant hcmv
specifically mutated ie1 core stat2 binding site displays hypersensitivity
to alpha interferon, delayed early viral protein accumulation, attenuated
growth fibroblasts. however, replication mutant virus specifically 
restored knockdown stat2 expression. interestingly, complex formation 
stat2 proved entirely separable disruption nuclear domain 10
(nd10), another key activity ie1. finally, results demonstrate ie1
counteracts antiviral interferon response promotes viral replication by
at least two distinct mechanisms, one depending sequestration stat2 the
other one likely involving nd10 interaction.
