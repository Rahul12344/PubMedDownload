the latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) epstein-barr virus causes cellular
transformation activates several intracellular signals, including nf-kappab
and c-jun n-terminal kinase. using yeast two-hybrid screening lmp1
c-terminal sequence bait, demonstrate bram1 (bone morphogenetic
protein receptor-associated molecule 1) lmp1-interacting protein. bram1
associates lmp1, vitro vivo, revealed confocal
microscopy, glutathione s-transferase pull-down, co-immunoprecipitation
assays. association mainly involves c-terminal half bram1 comprising 
the mynd domain ctar2 region lmp1, critical lmp1-mediated 
signaling pathways. show bram1 interferes lmp1-mediated nf-kappab
activation jnk signaling pathway. ctar2 region interacts 
with tumor necrosis factor (tnf-alpha receptor-associated death domain
protein, interesting find bram1 also interferes nf-kappab
activation mediated tnf-alpha. bram1 interferes lmp1-mediated and
tnf-alpha-induced nf-kappab activation targeting ikappabalpha molecules.
moreover, bram1 inhibits resistance lmp1-expressing cells to
tnf-alpha-induced cytotoxicity. therefore propose bram1 molecule
associates lmp1 functions negative regulator lmp1-mediated
biological functions.
