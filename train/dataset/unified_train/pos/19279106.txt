the mammalian interferon (ifn) signaling pathway primary component the
innate antiviral response. such, viral pathogens devised multiple
mechanisms antagonize pathway thus facilitate infection. dengue virus
(denv) encodes several proteins (ns2a, ns4a, ns4b) shown
individually inhibit ifn response. addition, denv infection results 
reduced levels expression stat2, required ifn signaling (m.
jones, a. davidson, l. hibbert, p. gruenwald, j. schlaak, s. ball, g. r. foster, 
and m. jacobs, j. virol. 79:5414-5420, 2005). translation denv genome
results single polypeptide, processed viral host proteases
into least 10 separate proteins. date, single denv protein been
implicated targeting stat2 decreased levels expression. we
demonstrate polymerase virus, ns5, binds stat2 is
necessary sufficient reduced level expression. decrease in
protein level observed requires ubiquitination proteasome activity, strongly 
suggesting active degradation process. furthermore, show the
degradation binding stat2 dependent expression the
polymerase context polyprotein undergoes proteolytic processing 
for ns5 maturation. thus, mature form ns5, expressed a
precursor, able bind stat2 unable target degradation,
establishing unique role viral polyprotein processing providing an
additional function viral polypeptide. therefore, identified 
novel mechanism denv evades innate immune response potential
target antiviral therapeutics.
