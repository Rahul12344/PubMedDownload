the envelope (env) jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (jsrv) functions an
oncoprotein. one mechanisms jsrv-induced cell transformation has
been proposed epithelial cells involves jsrv env binding hyaluronidase 2 (the
jsrv receptor), thereby inducing degradation allowing release and
activation ron tyrosine kinase normally suppressed hyal-2. this
study, report hyal-2 ron critical jsrv env-induced
transformation rat epithelial cell line iec-18, cytoplasmic tail
of jsrv env critical transform cell line. also determined 
that ron associate jsrv env normal stringent conditions.
in addition, cytoplasmic tail jsrv enjs5f16 (non oncogenic
jsrv-related endogenous retrovirus) env proteins appears major
influence activation status ron. thus, appears interaction 
of jsrv env ron complex previously thought requires
further investigation.
