previously, identified human liver endonexin ii (eii) present human
hepatocyte plasma membrane specific hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag)
binding protein. also showed spontaneous development anti-idiotypic
(anti-hbsag) antibodies rabbits immunized eii chicken immunized
with f(ab')2 fragment rabbit anti-eii igg. findings suggest the
existence receptor-ligand relationship eii hbsag. present
study, demonstrate small hbsag conjugated 10 nm colloidal gold also
binds specifically human hepatocytes. invagination coated pit region at
the hbsag binding sites human hepatocyte plasma membrane results the
internalization hbsag-gold particles. binding consequently the
internalization hbsag inhibited anti-eii anti-idiotypic (anti-hbsag) 
antibodies. findings indicate eii directly involved binding 
and uptake hepatitis b envelope proteins.
