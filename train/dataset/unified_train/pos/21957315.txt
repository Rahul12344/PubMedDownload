herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) double-stranded dna virus replicates 
the nucleus human host cell known interact many cellular
dna repair proteins. study, examined role cellular mismatch
repair (mmr) proteins virus life cycle. msh2 mlh1 required
for efficient replication hsv-1 normal human cells localized to
viral replication compartments. addition, previously reported interaction
between msh6 icp8 confirmed coimmunoprecipitation extended show
that ul12 also present complex. also report first time that
mlh1 associates nd10 nuclear bodies like nd10 proteins, mlh1 
is recruited incoming genome. knockdown mlh1 inhibits immediate-early
viral gene expression. msh2, hand, generally thought to
play role mismatch repair step prior mlh1, recruited 
to incoming genomes appears act later step viral life cycle.
silencing msh2 appears inhibit early gene expression. thus, mlh1 and
msh2 required appear participate distinct events virus life 
cycle. observation mlh1 plays earlier role hsv-1 infection than
does msh2 surprising may indicate novel function mlh1 distinct 
its known msh2-dependent role mismatch repair.
