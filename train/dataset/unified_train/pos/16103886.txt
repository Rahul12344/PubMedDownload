the e6 proteins high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpv) types a
well-documented ability target certain cellular proteins for
ubiquitin-mediated degradation via proteasome. previous studies shown
that e6 proteins interact differently different target proteins, that
the viral proteins, depending upon target, may recruit diverse cellular
ubiquitin-protein ligases. study, examined abilities e6
proteins hpv-16 hpv-18 interact induce degradation of
two pdz domain-containing targets, dlg hscrib. also mapped the
binding site e6 hscrib shown interaction e6 hscrib

targeted high-risk hpv e6 proteins underlines importance. finding
that targeted differently hpv-16 hpv-18 e 6 suggests
