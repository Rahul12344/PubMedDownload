rna helicases dead (asp-glu-ala-asp)-box family proteins involved
in many aspects rna metabolism transcription rna decay, of
them also shown multifunctional. dead-box helicase ddx5 of
host cells shown interact rna-dependent rna polymerase
(ns5b) hcv (hepatitis c virus). present study, report presence
of two independent ns5b-binding sites ddx5, one located n-terminus 
another c-terminus. n-terminal fragment ddx5, consists the
first 305 amino acids shall referred ddx5-n, expressed and
crystallized. crystal structure shows domain 1 (residues 79-303) ddx5
contains typical features found structures dead-box
helicases. ddx5-n also contains highly variable ntr (n-terminal region) of
unknown function crystal structure reveals structural elements part of
the ntr, namely residues 52-78. region forms extensive loop an
α-helix. co-immunoprecipitation experiments, ntr ddx5-n observed 
to auto-inhibit interaction ns5b. interestingly, α-helix ntr is
essential auto-inhibition seems mediate interaction between
the highly flexible 1-51 residues ntr ns5b-binding site ddx5-n.
furthermore, nmr investigations reveal direct interaction between
ddx5 ns5b vitro.
