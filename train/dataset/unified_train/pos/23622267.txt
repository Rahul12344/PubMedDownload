background: human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) causative agent of
adult t-cell leukemia tropical spastic paraparesis. htlv-1 encodes
transactivator protein tax interacts various cellular factors to
modulate transcription biological functions. additional cellular
mediators tax-mediated transcriptional activation htlv-1 long terminal
repeats (ltr) remain identified characterized.
results: study, investigated regulatory role group i
p21-activated kinases (paks) tax-induced ltr activation. wild-type and
kinase-dead mutants pak3 capable potentiating activity tax to
activate ltr transcription. effect paks ltr attributed the
n-terminal regulatory domain required action creb, creb-regulating
transcriptional coactivators (crtcs) p300/creb-binding protein. paks
physically associated tax crtcs. paks recruited ltr the
presence tax. sirnas either pak1 pak3 prevented interaction 
tax crtc1 recruitment tax ltr. sirnas also inhibited
ltr-dependent transcription htlv-1-transformed mt4 cells cells
transfected infectious clone htlv-1.
conclusion: group paks augment tax-mediated transcriptional activation of
htlv-1 ltr kinase-independent manner.
