the innate ability human cell silence endogenous retroviruses through
rna sequences encoding micrornas, suggests cellular rnai machinery 
major means host mounts defense response present day
retroviruses. indeed, cellular mirnas target hybridize specific sequences 
of htlv-1 hiv-1 viral transcripts. however, much like variety of
host immune responses retroviral infection, virus contains
mechanisms assist evasion viral inhibition control 
cellular rnai pathway. retroviruses hijack enzymatic catalytic
components rnai pathway, cases produce novel viral mirnas 
can either assist active viral infection promote latent state. here, we
show htlv-1 tax contributes dysregulation rnai pathway by
altering expression key components pathway. survey uninfected
and htlv-1 infected cells revealed drosha protein present lower levels
in htlv-1 infected cell lines infected primary cells, other
components dgcr8 dramatically altered. show colocalization of
tax drosha nucleus vitro well coimmunoprecipitation the
presence proteasome inhibitors, indicating tax interacts drosha 
may target specific areas cell, namely, proteasome. the
presence tax observed prevention primary mirna cleavage drosha.
finally, changes cellular mirna expression htlv-1 infected cells be
mimicked add back drosha addition antagomirs the
cellular mirnas downregulated virus.
