a northwestern screen cho-k1 cell line cdna library radiolabelled hiv-1
tar rna identified novel tar rna interacting protein, trip. human trip cdna
was also cloned expression induced phorbol esters. n-terminus
of trip shows high homology coiled coil domain flap, protein which
binds leucine-rich repeat (lrr) flightless (fli) interaction 
trip fli lrr confirmed vitro . trip bind single
stranded dna rna significantly binds double stranded dna weakly. in
contrast, trip binds double stranded rna high affinity two molecules 
trip bind tar stem. rna binding domain identified and
encompasses lysine-rich motif. trip-gfp fusion localised cytoplasm 
and excluded nucleus. fli c-terminal gelsolin-like domain which
binds actin therefore association trip fli lrr may provide 
link actin cytoskeleton rna mammalian cells.
