protein kinase pkr activated double-stranded rna (dsrna) phosphorylates
translation initiation factor 2alpha inhibit protein synthesis in
virus-infected mammalian cells. pkr contains two dsrna binding motifs (drbms i
and ii) required activation dsrna. strong evidence pkr
activation requires dimerization, role dsrna dimer formation is
controversial. making alanine substitutions predicted remove increasing
numbers side chain contacts drbms dsrna, found that
dimerization full-length pkr yeast impaired minimal combinations
of mutations required impair dsrna binding vitro. mutation ala-67 glu
in drbm-i, reported abolish dimerization without affecting dsrna binding,
destroyed activities assays. contrast, deletion second
dimerization region overlaps kinase domain effect pkr
dimerization yeast. human pkr contains least 15 autophosphorylation sites, 
but thr-446 thr-451 activation loop found be
critical kinase activity yeast. using antibody specific for
phosphorylated thr-451, showed thr-451 phosphorylation stimulated by
dsrna binding. results provide strong evidence dsrna binding required
for dimerization full-length pkr molecules vivo, leading to
autophosphorylation activation loop stimulation eif2alpha
kinase function pkr.
