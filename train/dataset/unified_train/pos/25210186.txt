the adenovirus e1a gene first gene expressed upon viral infection. e1a
remodels cellular environment maximize permissivity viral replication.
e1a also major transactivator viral early gene expression a
coregulator large number cellular genes. e1a carries functions
predominantly binding cellular regulatory proteins altering their
activities. unstructured nature e1a enables bind large variety 
of cellular proteins form new molecular complexes novel functions. c
terminus e1a least-characterized region protein, known 
binding partners. report identification cellular factor dref
(zbed1) novel direct binding partner e1a. studies identify dual
role dref viral life cycle. dref contributes activation gene
expression viral promoters early infection. unexpectedly, also
functions growth restriction factor adenovirus knockdown dref
enhances virus growth increases viral genome copy number late the
infection. also identify dref component viral replication centers. e1a
affects subcellular distribution dref within pml bodies enhances dref 
sumoylation. findings identify dref novel e1a c terminus binding partner
and provide evidence supporting role dref viral replication.importance: 
this work identifies putative transcription factor dref new target of
the e1a oncoproteins human adenovirus. dref found primarily localize
with pml nuclear bodies uninfected cells relocalize virus
replication centers infection. dref also found sumoylated, and
this enhanced presence e1a. knockdown dref reduced levels of
viral transcripts detected 20 h, 40 h, postinfection, increased
overall virus yield, enhanced viral dna replication. dref also found to
localize viral promoters infection together e1a. results
suggest dref contributes activation viral gene expression. however,
like several pml-associated proteins, dref also appears function a
growth restriction factor adenovirus infection.
