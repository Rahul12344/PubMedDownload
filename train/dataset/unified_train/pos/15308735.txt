promyelocytic leukemia protein (pml) nuclear bodies nuclear domain 10s (nd10s)
are multiprotein nuclear structures implicated transcriptional and
posttranscriptional gene regulation disrupted replication many
dna viruses. interferon increases size number pml nuclear bodies and
stimulates transcription several genes encoding pml nuclear body proteins.
moreover, pml nuclear body proteins colocalize sites viral dna
synthesis transcription. study, relationship lytic
epstein-barr virus (ebv) replication sp110b, pml nuclear body protein, 
investigated. sp110b shown physically functionally interact the
ebv protein sm. sm expressed early ebv replicative cycle and
posttranscriptionally increases level target ebv lytic transcripts. sm
bound sp110b via two distinct sites sp110b rna-independent manner. sm
also specifically induced expression sp110b lytic ebv replication and
in several cell types. exogenous expression sp110b synergistically enhanced
sm-mediated accumulation intronless lytic viral transcripts. this
synergistic effect shown promoter independent, posttranscriptional, and
the result increased stabilization target transcripts. finally, inhibiting 
sp110b expression decreased accumulation sm-responsive lytic ebv transcript
in ebv-infected cells. findings imply sm induces sp110b expression,
binds sp110b, utilizes recruited sp110b protein increase the
stability lytic ebv transcripts, indicating sp110b component 
cellular machinery ebv utilizes enhance lytic ebv replication.
