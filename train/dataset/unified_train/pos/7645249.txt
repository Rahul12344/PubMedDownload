poliovirus infection results number host cell changes, including specific
alterations cellular proteins. study characterizes cleavage
of cytoskeletal protein, microtubule-associated protein 4 (map-4) and
investigates identity viral protease mediates cleavage.
map-4 cleavage poliovirus previously identified using monoclonal
antibody (m. joachims d. etchison, 1992, j. virol. 66, 5997-5804). this
study, map-4 cleavage found occur cells infected some
picornaviruses, poliovirus human rhinovirus 14. infection types of
viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus adenovirus, types of
picornaviruses, encephalomyocarditis virus, result map-4 cleavage. 
determine viral mediator map-4 cleavage, effects purified
poliovirus proteases map-4 integrity examined immunoblot. map-4
substrates incubated concentrations poliovirus 2a more
than sufficient induce p220 cleavage, effect map-4. however,
when map-4 substrates incubated purified 3c protease (3cpro), cleavage 
products detected identical size generated vivo 
poliovirus-infected cells; use mutant 3c protease result in
map-4 cleavage. cleavage map-4 also demonstrated purified 3cdpro, and
the vitro cleavage kinetics examined. indirect immunofluorescence
revealed map-4 cleavage also correlated marked "collapse" of
microtubules late infection, indicating possible relationship between
3cpro-mediated map-4 cleavage changes microtubule system infected
cells.
