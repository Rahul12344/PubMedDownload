herpes simplex virus 1 encodes two multifunctional regulatory proteins,
infected-cell proteins 22 0 (icp22 icp0). icp0 promiscuous
transactivator, whereas icp22 required vivo efficient replication
and expression subset late (gamma2) genes rodent rabbit cell lines 
and primary human cell strains (restrictive cells) hep-2 vero
(permissive) cells. report identification yeast two-hybrid system
of cellular protein designated p60 interacts icp22. protein
(apparent mr 60,000) previously described known
motifs. analyses p60 revealed following. (i) p60 bound fast-migrating,
underprocessed wild-type icp22 icp22 lacking carboxyl-terminal 24 amino
acids icp22 lacking carboxyl-terminal 40 amino acids, whereas the
previously identified cellular protein p78 (r. bruni b. roizman, j. virol.
72:8525-8531, 1998) bound forms icp22. interaction p60 only
one isoform icp22 supports hypothesis isoform herpes simplex
virus proteins performs specific function may different of
other isoforms. (ii) p60 also bound icp0; binding icp0 independent 
that icp22. (iii) p60 localized uninfected rabbit skin cells nuclei
and cytoplasm. rabbit skin cells infected wild-type virus, p60 was
posttranslationally processed higher apparent mr redistributed. 
posttranslational processing required presence genes encoding icp22
and ul13 protein kinase. (iv) uninfected hep-2 cells, p60 localized primarily 
in nuclei. soon infection wild-type virus, p60 localized in
discrete small nuclear structures icp0. late infection, icp0 p60
tended disperse p60 change apparent mr. localization p60
was independent icp22, p60 tended localized small nuclear
structures less dispersed cells infected mutants lacking genes
encoding ul13 us3 protein kinases. results suggest that
posttranslational modification p60 mediated either icp0 (permissive
cells) icp22 ul13 protein kinase (restrictive rabbit skin cells) and
that restrictive phenotype rabbit skin cells may related failure
to process p60 mutants lacking genes encoding ul13 icp22.
