transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) implicated pathogenesis of
liver disease. tgf-beta involved liver regeneration the
fibrotic cirrhotic transformation hepatitis viral infection. hepatitis c
virus (hcv) infection often leads cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma. hcv 
nonstructural 5a (ns5a) protein multifunctional protein modulates
cytokine-mediated signal transduction pathways. elucidate molecular
mechanism hcv pathogenesis, examined effect ns5a protein on
tgf-beta-stimulated signaling cascades. show ns5a protein inhibited the
tgf-beta-mediated signaling pathway hepatoma cell lines determined by
reporter gene assay. investigate role ns5a, examined the
protein/protein interaction ns5a tgf-beta signal transducers. in
vitro vivo binding data showed ns5a protein directly interacted 
tgf-beta receptor (tbetar-i) hepatoma cell lines. interaction was
mapped amino acids 148-238 ns5a. also found ns5a protein
co-localized tbetar-i cytoplasm huh7 cells inhibited
tgf-beta-mediated nuclear translocation smad2. furthermore, demonstrate
that ns5a protein abrogated phosphorylation smad2 the
heterodimerization smad3 smad4. explore relevance viral 
infection, examined effect hcv subgenomic replicon tgf-beta 
signaling pathway. show hcv subgenomic replicon also inhibited
tgf-beta-induced signaling cascades. results indicate hcv ns5a
modulates tgf-beta signaling interaction tbetar-i ns5a may 
be important risk factor hcv-associated liver pathogenesis.
