vascular diseases supported aberrant angiogenesis increased incidence 
hiv-1-infected patients. several data suggest endothelium dysfunction relies
on action hiv-1 proteins rather direct effect virus itself.
the hiv-1 matrix protein p17 known deregulate biological activity of
different immune cells. recently, p17 found mimic il-8 chemokine activity 
by binding il-8 receptor cxcr1. show p17 binds high
affinity cxcr2, cxcr1-related receptor, promotes formation of
capillary-like structures human endothelial cells (ecs) interacting with
both cxcr1 cxcr2 expressed ec surface. erk signaling via akt was
defined pathway responsible p17-induced tube formation. ex vivo in
vivo experimental models confirmed provasculogenic activity p17, was
comparable induced vegf-a. hypothesis major role p17 in
hiv-1-induced aberrant angiogenesis enforced finding p17 is
detected, single protein, blood vessels hiv-1-patients in
particular nucleus ecs. localization p17 nucleus ecs was
evidenced also vitro experiments, suggesting internalization of
exogenous p17 ecs mechanisms receptor-mediated endocytosis. recognizing 
p17 interaction cxcr1 cxcr2 key event sustaining ec aberrant
angiogenesis could help us identify new treatment strategies combating
aids-related vascular diseases.
