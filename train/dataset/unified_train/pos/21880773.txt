rubella virus (rv) highly transmissible pathogenic agent causes the
disease rubella. maternal rv infection early pregnancy causes death of
the fetus congenital rubella syndrome infants. however, cellular
receptor rv yet identified. study, found the
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (mog) specifically bound e1 envelope
glycoprotein rv, antibody mog could block rv infection. most
importantly, also showed ectopic expression mog cell surface of
293t cells rendered nonpermissive cell line permissive rv entry and
replication. thus, study identified cellular receptor rv and
suggests blocking mog attachment site rv may strategy for
molecular intervention rv infection.
