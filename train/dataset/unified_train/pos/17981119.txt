cell entry simian virus 40 (sv40) involves caveolar/lipid raft-mediated
endocytosis, vesicular transport endoplasmic reticulum (er), translocation
into cytosol, import nucleus. analyzed effects of
er-associated processes factors infection isolated viruses and
found sv40 makes use thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, erp57 pdi, 
as well retrotranslocation proteins derlin-1 sel1l. erp57 isomerizes
specific interchain disulfides connecting major capsid protein, vp1, a
crosslinked network neighbors, thus uncoupling 12 72 vp1 pentamers.
cryo-electron tomography indicated loss interchain disulfides coupled
with calcium depletion induces selective dissociation 12 vertex pentamers,
a step likely mimic uncoating virus cytosol. thus, virus
utilizes protein folding machinery initial uncoating exploiting
the er-associated degradation machinery presumably escape er lumen
into cytosol.
