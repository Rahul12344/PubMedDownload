the tat-responsive region (tar) element critical rna regulatory element in
the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) long terminal repeat, required
for activation gene expression transactivator protein tat. recently, we
demonstrated gel-retardation analysis rna polymerase ii binds tar rna 
and tat prevents binding even tat bind tar rna. 
results suggested direct interactions tat rna polymerase ii may 
prevent rna polymerase ii pausing lead tat-mediated increases in
transcriptional elongation. test possibility, performed protein
interaction studies rna polymerase ii hiv-1 closely
related hiv-2 tat protein. studies indicated hiv-1 hiv-2 
tat proteins could specifically interact rna polymerase ii. mutagenesis of
both hiv-1 hiv-2 tat demonstrated basic domains hiv-1
and hiv-2 tat proteins required interaction. furthermore, "far
western" analysis suggested largest subunit rna polymerase ii the
site interaction tat. interactions tat rna polymerase ii
were similar magnitude detected rna polymerase ii the
cellular transcription factor rap30, stably associates rna polymerase 
ii transcriptional elongation. studies consistent model
that rna polymerase ii cellular target tat resulting tat-mediated
increases transcriptional elongation hiv long terminal repeat.
