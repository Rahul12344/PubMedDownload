epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen 1 (ebna1) essential maintenance
of episome establishment latency. study, observed heat
treatment effectively induced ebna1 transcription ebv-transformed b95-8 and
human lcl cell lines. although cp considered sole promoter used the
expression ebna1 transcripts lymphoblastoid cell lines, rt-pcr
results showed ebna1 transcripts induced heat treatment arise from
qp-initiated transcripts. using bioinformatics, high affinity functional
heat shock factor 1 (hsf1)-binding element within -17/+4 oligonucleotide of
the qp found, determined electrophoretic mobility shift assay 
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. moreover, heat shock exogenous hsf1
expression induced qp activity reporter assays. further, rna
interference-mediated hsf1 gene silencing attenuated heat-induced ebna1
expression b95-8 cells. results provide evidence ebna1 new
target transcription factor hsf1.
