granzymes key components immune response play important roles 
eliminating host cells infected intracellular pathogens. several granzymes are
potent inducers cell death. however, whether granzymes use additional
mechanisms exert antipathogen activity remains elusive. here, show
that adenovirus-infected cells granzyme b (gzmb) downstream
apoptosis pathways inhibited, granzyme h (gzmh), orphan granzyme without
known function, directly cleaves adenovirus dna-binding protein (dbp), a
viral component absolutely required viral dna replication. directly
addressed functional consequences cleavage dbp gzmh 
the generation virus encodes gzmh-resistant dbp. virus
demonstrated gzmh directly induces important decay viral dna
replication. interestingly, gzmh also cleaves adenovirus 100k assembly
protein, major inhibitor gzmb, relieves gzmb inhibition. results
provide first evidence granzymes mediate antiviral activity 
direct cleavage viral substrates, suggest different granzymes
have synergistic functions outflank viral defenses block host antiviral
activities.
