hiv-1 acquires impressive number foreign components formation.
despite previous efforts spent studying nature functionality of
virus-anchored host molecules, exact mechanism(s) such
constituents acquired hiv-1 still unknown. however, case of
icam-1, one extensively studied transmembrane proteins found
associated mature virions, pr55(gag) precursor polyprotein appears be
a potential interaction partner. investigated characterized the
molecular level process icam-1 incorporation using initially a
pr55(gag)-based virus-like particle (vlp) model. substitution various domains 
of pr55(gag), nucleocapsid, sp2, p6, effect the
acquisition icam-1. found structural matrix protein (ma) is
mandatory icam-1 incorporation within vlps, confirmed novel
observation replication-competent hiv-1 molecular clone nl4.3.
additional studies suggest c-terminal two-thirds ma, especially
13 amino acids positioned inside fifth α-helix, important. moreover,
based three-dimensional (3d) modeling protein-protein interactions (i.e.,
protein-protein docking) validation virus capture assay, we
found series acidic residues domain interact basic amino
acids located icam-1 cytoplasmic tail. findings provide new insight
into molecular mechanism governing acquisition icam-1, host molecule
known enhance hiv-1 infectivity significant manner. altogether, these
observations offer new avenue development antiviral therapeutics
that directed target host origin.importance: intercellular adhesion
molecule 1 (icam-1) cell surface host component known efficiently
inserted within emerging hiv-1 particles. demonstrated that
host-derived icam-1 molecules act strong attachment factor increase
hiv-1 infectivity substantially. despite previous efforts spent studying
virus-associated host molecules, precise mechanism(s) such
constituents inserted within emerging hiv-1 particles still remains obscure. 
previous data suggest pr55(gag) precursor polyprotein appears a
potential interaction partner icam-1. present study, demonstrate
that hiv-1 matrix domain plays key role icam-1 incorporation
process. observations confirmed whole-virus preparations amplified
in primary human cells, thereby providing physiological significance data.
