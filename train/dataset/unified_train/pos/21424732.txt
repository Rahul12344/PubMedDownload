in present study, seven novel host cell factors associated vp22 were
identified human leukocyte cdna library using yeast two-hybrid
high-throughput screening system. confirm interactions, vp22 and
its homologues two candidate targets tagged enhanced cyan yellow
fluorescent protein. ring finger protein 10 (rnf10), wd repeat-containing
protein 42a (wdr42a) vp22 alone showed distinct subcellular localization
patterns, rnf10 wdr42a relocated co-expressed vp22 its
homologues. thus, potential host cell factors vp22 might expand list
of host targets vp22.
