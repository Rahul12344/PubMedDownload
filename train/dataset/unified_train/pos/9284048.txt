p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) activity proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (pcna)-dependent dna replication binding cdk/cyclin
complexes pcna distinct domains. human papillomavirus (hpv)-16
e7 oncoprotein (16e7) abrogated dna damage-induced cell cycle arrest vivo,
despite high levels p21. using cell lysates purified proteins show that
16e7 prevented p21 inhibiting cdk2/cyclin e activity pcna-dependent
dna replication, whereas nononcogenic hpv-6 e7 reduced effects.
inactivation inhibitory functions p21 attained binding
between 16e7 sequences carboxy-terminal end p21 overlap with
the pcna-binding site second p21 cyclin-binding motif. data imply
that carboxyl terminus p21 simultaneously modulates cdk activity 
pcna-dependent dna replication single protein, 16e7, override this
modulation disrupt normal cell cycle control.
