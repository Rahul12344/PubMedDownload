the scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase complex plays important roles cell growth,
survival, differentiation via ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated regulation of
protein stability. fbw7 (also known fbxw7, sel-10, hcdc4, hago), a
substrate recognition subunit scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase, facilitates the
degradation several proto-oncogene products proteasome. given that
mutations fbw7 found various types human cancers, fbw7 considered
to potent tumor suppressor. present study, show e1a, an
oncogene product derived adenovirus, interferes activity the
scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. e1a interacted scf(fbw7) attenuated the
ubiquitylation target proteins vivo. furthermore, using vitro
purified scf(fbw7) component proteins, found e1a directly bound to
roc1/rbx1 cul1 e1a inhibited ubiquitin ligase activity the
roc1/rbx1-cul1 complex another ring-type ubiquitin ligase, mdm2. 
ectopically expressed e1a interacted cellular endogenous roc1/rbx1 cul1 
and decelerated degradation several protooncogene products were
degraded scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. moreover, wild-type adenovirus
infection, adenovirus-derived e1a interacted endogenous roc1/rbx1 and
decelerated degradation endogenous target protein scf(fbw7). these
observations demonstrated e1a perturbs protein turnover regulated by
scf(fbw7) inhibition scf(fbw7) ubiquitin ligase. findings may 
help explain mechanism whereby adenovirus infection induces unregulated
proliferation.
