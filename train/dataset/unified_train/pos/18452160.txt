we long-standing interest nuclear protease appears be
involved carcinogenesis. recently identified protease high
temperature requirement factor 1 (htra1), also known prss11, member
of oxidative stress-response family proteases. htra1 classified as
a secreted protease involved tgfbeta signaling, recent work shown
htra1 tumor suppressor. show processed forms htra1 are
found intracellularly intranuclearly, active intranuclear form of
htra1 shows approximately mr 29,000. further, expression hpv e6/e7 proteins
is associated post-transcriptional up-regulation htra1 (most notably
the nuclear form), htra1 found associated hpv e6 e7
proteins.
