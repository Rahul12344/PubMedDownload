e1b-55k-associated protein 5 (e1b-ap5) cellular, heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein targeted adenovirus (ad) e1b-55k infection.
the function e1b-ap5 infection, however, remains largely unknown. given
the role e1b-55k targets dna damage response, examined whether
e1b-ap5 function integral pathways. here, show novel role for
e1b-ap5 key regulator atr signaling pathways activated ad
infection. e1b-ap5 recruited viral replication centers infection,
where colocalizes atr-interacting protein (atrip) atr substrate
replication protein 32 (rpa32). indeed, e1b-ap5 associates atrip rpa
complex component rpa70 uninfected ad-infected cells. additionally,
glutathione s-transferase pull-downs show e1b-ap5 associates rpa
components rpa70 rpa32 directly vitro. e1b-ap5 required the
atr-dependent phosphorylation rpa32 infection contributes the
ad-induced phosphorylation smc1 h2ax. regard, interesting
that ad5 ad12 differentially promote phosphorylation rpa32, rad9, 
smc1 infection ad12 promotes significant phosphorylation of
rpa32 rad9, whereas ad5 weakly promotes rpa32 phosphorylation does
not induce rad9 phosphorylation. data suggest ad5 ad12 have
evolved different strategies regulate dna damage signaling pathways during
infection order promote viral replication. taken together, results
define role e1b-ap5 atr signaling pathways activated infection.
this might broader implications regulation atr activity during
cellular dna replication response dna damage.
