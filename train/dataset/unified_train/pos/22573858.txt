acid sphingomyelinase (asmase) converts lipid sphingomyelin (sm) to
phosphocholine ceramide optimum activity acidic ph. normally,
asmase located lysosomes endosomes, membrane damage the
interaction bacterial viral pathogens trigger recruitment
to plasma membrane. rhinovirus measles viruses require asmase
activity early stages infection. sphingomyelin ceramide are
important components lipid rafts potent signaling molecules. each
plays roles mediating macropinocytosis, shown important
for ebolavirus (ebov) infection. here, investigated role asmase its
substrate, sm, ebov infection. work performed biosafety level 4
with wild-type virus specificity mechanistic analysis performed using
virus pseudotypes virus-like particles. found virus particles
strongly associate sm-rich regions cell membrane depletion of
sm reduces ebov infection. asm-specific drugs multiple small interfering rnas
strongly inhibit infection ebov ebov glycoprotein pseudotyped viruses 
but pseudotypes bearing glycoprotein vesicular stomatitis
virus. interestingly, binding virus-like particles cells strongly
associated surface-localized asmase well sm-enriched sites. work
suggests asmase activity sm presence necessary efficient
infection cells ebov. inhibition pathway may provide new
avenues drug treatment.
