n(pro) multifunctional autoprotease unique pestiviruses. interacting 
partners n(pro) protein classical swine fever virus (csfv), swine
pestivirus, insufficiently defined. using yeast two-hybrid screen, we
identified poly(c)-binding protein 1 (pcbp1) novel interacting partner of
the csfv n(pro) protein confirmed coimmunoprecipitation, glutathione 
s-transferase (gst) pulldown, confocal assays. knockdown pcbp1 small
interfering rna suppressed csfv growth, overexpression pcbp1 promoted
csfv growth. furthermore, showed type interferon downregulated by
pcbp1, well n(pro). results suggest cellular pcbp1 positively
modulates csfv growth.
