activator protein-1 (ap-1) regulates diverse gene responses triggered by
environmental cues virus-induced cellular stress. although many signaling
events leading ap-1 activation described, fundamental features
underlying binding site selection factor recruitment dimeric ap-1
complexes target genes remain mostly uncharacterized. using recombinant 
full-length human ap-1 dimers formed c-jun fos family members (c-fos,
fosb, fra-1, fra-2) dna binding transcriptional analysis, found that
each ap-1 complex exhibits differential activity distinct
non-consensus ap-1 sites present human papillomavirus (hpv), ap-1
complex capable activating transcription vitro-reconstituted hpv
chromatin p300- acetyl-coa-dependent manner. transcription hpv
chromatin requires ap-1-dependent contact-driven recruitment p300.
acetylation dimeric ap-1 complexes p300 enhances ap-1 binding dna. using
a human c-33a cervical cancer-derived cell line harboring episomal hpv type
11 genome, illustrate binding site selectivity recognized c-jun, junb,
jund, various fos family members combinatorial unique pattern,
highlighting diversity importance non-canonical binding site
recognition various ap-1 family proteins.
