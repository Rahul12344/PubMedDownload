glycoprotein (gi) herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) contains tandem
repeat (tr) region including amino acids serine threonine, residues 
can utilized o-glycosylation. length tr region determined 
for 82 clinical hsv-1 isolates results revealed polymorphic
distribution two six eight repeated blocks majority harbouring
between two four repeats. assessment o-glycosylation capacity an
acceptor peptide (stpstttstpsttt), representing two gi blocks, showed that
the peptide universal substrate o-glycosylation two
most commonly expressed n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galnac)-t1 -t2
transferases, also galnac-t3, -t4 -t11 transferases.
immunoblotting virus-infected cells showed gi exclusively
o-glycosylated galnac monosaccharides (tn antigen). polymorphic mucin
region described previously hsv-1 unique finding, as
repeated blocks within gi homologues lacking alphaherpesviruses.
