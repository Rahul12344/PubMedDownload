previously, reported human papillomavirus (hpv) type 16 e6 binds c/h1,
c/h3, c-terminal domains coactivators p300 cbp, causing the
modulation transcription certain genes controlled nf-kappab (p65 
rela) p53. establish biological significance observations, we
have focused transcriptional regulation interleukin-8 (il-8), potent 
chemoattractant lymphocytes neutrophils, also essential for
the initiation local immune response. il-8 promoter regulated by
nf-kappab/p65 response tumor necrosis factor alpha requires the
cooperation coactivators cbp/p300 steroid receptor coactivator 1
(src-1) p300/cbp-associated factor (p/caf) optimal activation. here
we report that, presence hpv-16 e6, promoter activity il-8 was
repressed. moreover, mutational analysis il-8 promoter, found 
that e6 down-regulates il-8 promoter activity nf-kappab/p65
binding site. inhibition appears result ability hpv-16 e6 
compete nf-kappab/p65 src-1 binding n terminus c terminus
of cbp, respectively. reporter data also showed e7 represses il-8 promoter
activity, though lesser extent e6 but, like e6, repression e7 is
through nf-kappab/p65 binding site. e7 shown first time bind
to p/caf, binding necessary regulation il-8
promoter. e6 e7 together inhibited transcription il-8 promoter a
greater extent either alone. finally, rnase protection assay, showed
that synthesis endogenous il-8 mrna repressed keratinocytes stably 
expressing e6 e7. taken together, results provide evidence e6 e7
can cooperatively disrupt il-8 transcription disruption of
transcriptional active complexes, may important consequences for
immune responses infected hosts.
