the virulence influenza viruses depends activity viral rna
polymerase complex viral regulatory phosphoproteins. identified the
protein kinase c (pkc) inhibitor gö6976 post-entry anti-influenza viral
effect, using polymerase activity-based reporter assay. inhibitory
effect observed influenza virus-infected cells well cells
transiently transfected constructs rna polymerase complex.
importantly, vitro analysis viral protein phosphorylation identified
pkcalpha kinase phosphorylating pb1 ns1, pb2, pa np. gö6976
was able block pkc-specific phosphorylation vitro. thus, data suggest
that pkc contributes phosphorylation influenza pb1 ns1 proteins
which appears functionally relevant viral rna polymerase activity 
and efficient viral replication.
