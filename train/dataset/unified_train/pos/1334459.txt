the e5 oncoprotein bovine papillomavirus type 1 44 amino acid, highly
hydrophobic protein induces stable transformation immortalized murine
fibroblasts, presumably activation growth factor receptors.
previous studies shown e5 protein complexes 16 kda (16k)
pore-forming protein vacuolar h(+)-atpases. integral membrane protein 
essential acidification function subcellular compartments that
process growth factor receptors. using sv40 expression system cos cells, we
analyzed whether e5-16k complexes bind additional cellular proteins,
including growth factor receptors. studies demonstrate e5 binds to
both 16k protein pdgf receptor tri-component complex
can isolated antibodies specific protein. importantly, 16k
protein bound pdgf receptor absence e5, suggesting e5 binds
to pdgf receptor via interaction 16k protein. e5 mutant
lacking hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids retained binding both
16k pdgf receptor, indicating e5 binds proteins its
hydrophobic, membrane-associating domain. studies reveal hydrophobic, 
intramembrane interactions govern association e5, 16k pdgf
receptor, suggesting ligand-independent mechanism receptor activation a
potential link receptor signal transduction pathways membrane pore
