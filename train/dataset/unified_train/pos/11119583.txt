entry duck hepatitis b virus (dhbv) initiated specific interaction of
its large envelope protein (l) cellular entry receptor, recently
identified carboxypeptidase (cpd; historically gp180). report, we
present evidence demonstrating receptor down-regulated result
of dhbv infection: (i) receptor levels determined western blot much
reduced dhbv-infected duck livers undetectable immunostaining in
infected cultured hepatocytes; (ii) results metabolic labeling experiments
indicate enhanced receptor protein turnover; (iii) kinetics receptor loss 
from newly infected cells correlated accumulation newly synthesized
viral protein; (iv) expression dhbv l protein, transduced recombinant
adenovirus, sufficient eliminate gp180/cpd golgi compartment, its
normal predominant location; (v) gp180/cpd remained absent golgi
compartment infected hepatocytes, even overexpression recombinant
adenovirus, residual amounts subsequently became detectable a
perinuclear compartment, containing dhbv l protein; (vi) expression dhbv l
protein hepg2 cell line, stably expressing gp180/cpd, leads incomplete
receptor maturation induces degradation. taken together, data are
consistent model virus receptor interacts early the
biosynthetic pathway viral l protein, leading retention a
pre-golgi compartment subsequent degradation, thus preventing receptor
interference export dhbv via secretory pathway shares
with receptor. accordingly, analogously receptor down-regulation 
retroviral systems, dhbv receptor down-modulation may account the
much-reduced efficiency dhbv superinfection preinfected hepatocytes.
