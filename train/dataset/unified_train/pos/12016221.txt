we previously shown human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) integrase is
an unstable protein substrate n-end rule degradation pathway. 
degradation pathway shares ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, rad6, the
post-replication/translesion dna repair pathway. dna repair thought to
play essential role hiv-1 integration, investigated whether other
molecules dna repair pathway could interact integrase. observed
that co-expression human rad18 induced accumulation otherwise
unstable form hiv-1 integrase. accumulation occurred even though hrad18
possesses ring finger domain, structure generally associated e3 
ubiquitin ligase function protein degradation. evidence interaction
between integrase hrad18 obtained reciprocal
co-immunoprecipitation. moreover found 162-residue region hrad18
(amino acids 65-226) sufficient integrase stabilization and
interaction. finally, observed hiv-1 integrase co-localized hrad18
in nuclear structures subpopulation co-transfected cells. taken together,
these findings identify hrad18 novel interacting partner hiv-1 integrase 
and suggest role post-replication/translesion dna repair retroviral 
integration process.
