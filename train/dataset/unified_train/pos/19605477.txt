the hepatitis c virus (hcv) core protein known modulate apoptosis and
contribute viral replication pathogenesis. study, have
identified bcl-2 homology 3 (bh3) domain core protein essential 
for proapoptotic property. coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed 
core protein interacts specifically human myeloid cell factor 1 (mcl-1),
a prosurvival member bcl-2 family, prosurvival members 
(bcl-x(l) bcl-w). moreover, overexpression mcl-1 protects against
core-induced apoptosis. using peptide mimetics, core found release
cytochrome c isolated mitochondria complemented bad. thus, core is
a bona fide bh3-only protein properties similar noxa, a
bh3-only member bcl-2 family binds preferentially mcl-1. are
three critical hydrophobic residues bh3 domain core protein, and
they essential proapoptotic property core protein.
furthermore, genotype 1b core protein effective genotype 2a 
core protein inducing apoptosis due single-amino-acid difference one
of hydrophobic residues (residue 119). replacing residue the
j6/jfh-1 infectious clone (genotype 2a) corresponding amino acid 
genotype 1b core protein produced mutant virus, j6/jfh-1(v119l), induced 
significantly higher levels apoptosis infected cells parental 
j6/jfh-1 virus. furthermore, core protein j6/jfh-1(v119l), of
j6/jfh-1, interacted mcl-1 virus-infected cells. taken together, core
protein novel bh3-only viral homologue contributes induction 
apoptosis hcv infection.
