f-box proteins direct degradation extensive range proteins via the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. members large family proteins are
typically bipartite. recruit specific substrates substrate-binding
domain and, via f-box, link core components major class of
ubiquitin ligases (scf1). f-box proteins thus determine specificity of
scf1-mediated ubiquitination. f-box-like motifs recently detected in
poxvirus ankyrin repeat (ank) proteins clear compositional differences to
typical f-box proteins raise questions regarding classification function 
of motif. show five ank proteins representative
poxvirus, orf virus, interact vivo core components scf1 ubiquitin 
ligase complex. interaction dependent poxviral f-box-like motif the
adaptor subunit complex (skp1). viral protein block enzymatic
activity complex. observations identify poxviral motif a
functional f-box. also identify new class f-box contrast to
cellular counterparts truncated, extreme c-terminal location is
paired ank protein-binding domain. ank proteins constitute largest
family poxviral proteins function significance their
abundance remained enigma. propose poxviruses use unique
ank/f-box proteins dictate target specificity scf1 ubiquitin ligases and
thereby exploit cell's ubiquitin-proteasome machinery.
