htlv-1 infection causes adult t-cell leukemia (atl). development atl is
thought associated disruption transcriptional control cellular
genes. htlv-1 basic leucine-zipper (bzip) factor, hbz, encoded the
complementary strand provirus. previously reported hbz interacts
with c-jun suppresses transcriptional activity. identify cellular 
factor(s) interact hbz, conducted yeast two-hybrid screen using
full-length hbz bait identified mafb. hbz heterodimerizes mafb via
each bzip domain. luciferase analysis revealed significant decrease in
transcription maf recognition element (mare) manner dependent the
bzip domain hbz. indeed, production full-length hbz cells decreased 
mare-bound mafb protein, indicating hbz abrogates dna-binding activity
of mafb. addition, hbz reduced steady-state levels mafb, levels
were restored treatment proteasome inhibitor. results suggest a
suppressive effect hbz maf function, may significant role in
htlv-1 related pathogenesis.
