hepatitis b viral core protein present nucleus cytoplasm of
infected hepatocytes. strong correlation intrahepatic
distribution core protein viral replication state disease activity
in patients chronic hepatitis. understand role core protein the
pathogenesis hbv, used yeast two-hybrid system search cellular
proteins interacting carboxyl terminus core protein, region
is involved number important functions viral replication cycle
including rna packaging dna synthesis. cdna encoding extreme c-terminal
region human actin-binding protein, abp-276/278, identified. this
interaction confirmed vitro vivo. addition, the
extreme c-terminal region abp-276/278 interacted nearly full-length
hbv core protein. since region present core precore
proteins, likely core precore proteins hbv interact
with c-terminal region abp-276/278. minimal region abp-276/278
which interacted hbv core protein c-terminal 199 amino acid
residues correspond part 23rd repeat, entire 24th repeat 
the intervening hinge ii region abps. potential functional outcome abp 
interaction hbv replication contribution pathological changes
seen patients chronic hbv infection discussed.
