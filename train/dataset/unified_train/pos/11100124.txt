neurological disorders develop people infected human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1). however, underlying mechanisms remain 
largely unknown. report binding hiv-1 transactivator (tat)
protein low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (lrp) promoted
efficient uptake tat neurons. lrp-mediated uptake tat followed 
translocation neuronal nucleus. furthermore, binding tat lrp
resulted substantial inhibition neuronal binding, uptake degradation of
physiological ligands lrp, including alpha2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein e4,
amyloid precursor protein amyloid beta-protein. model macaques
infected chimeric strain simian-human immunodeficiency virus, increased
staining amyloid precursor protein associated tat expression the
brains simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques with
encephalitis. results indicate hiv-1 tat may mediate hiv-1-induced
neuropathology pathway involving disruption metabolic balance of
lrp ligands direct activation neuronal genes.
