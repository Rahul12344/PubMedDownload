the cellular positive transcription elongation factor b (p-tefb), containing
cyclin t1 cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (cdk9), interacts human
immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (hiv-1) regulatory protein tat enable viral
transcription replication. cyclin t1 unusually long cyclin is
engaged cellular regulatory proteins. previous studies showed the
granulin/epithelin precursor (gep) binds histidine-rich region cyclin t1
and inhibits p-tefb function. gep composed repeats vary sequence
and properties. gep also binds directly tat. show gep of
its constituent granulin repeats inhibit hiv-1 transcription via tat without 
directly binding cyclin t1. interactions granulins tat cyclin 
t1 differ respect binding sites divalent cation requirements,
and identified granulin repeats bind differentially tat cyclin t1.
granulins de e bind tat interact directly cyclin t1. these
granulins present complexes tat p-tefb tat forms a
bridge cellular proteins. granulins de e repress transcription
from hiv-1 ltr gene expression viral genome, raising the
possibility developing granulin-based inhibitors viral infection.
