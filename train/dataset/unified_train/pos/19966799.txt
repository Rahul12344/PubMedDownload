the cullin 4-dna-damage-binding protein 1 (cul4-ddb1) ubiquitin ligase machinery 
regulates diverse cellular functions subverted pathogenic viruses. 
here report crystal structure ddb1 complex central fragment
of hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx), whose ddb1-binding activity important
for viral infection. structure reveals hbx binds ddb1 an
alpha-helical motif, also found unrelated paramyxovirus sv5-v
protein despite sequence divergence. structure-based functional
analysis suggests that, like sv5-v, hbx captures ddb1 redirect ubiquitin
ligase activity cul4-ddb1 e3 ligase. also identify alpha-helical
motif shared viral proteins cellular substrate-recruiting
subunits e3 complex, ddb1-cul4-associated factors (dcafs) are
functionally mimicked viral hijackers. together, studies reveal a
common yet promiscuous structural element important assembly of
cellular virally hijacked cul4-ddb1 e3 complexes.
