jc virus (jcv) human polyomavirus causative agent fatal
demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). jcv
infection host cells dependent interactions cell surface asparagine
(n)-linked sialic acids serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine(2a) receptor
(5-ht(2a)r). 5-ht(2a)r contains five potential n-linked glycosylation sites
on extracellular n terminus. glycosylation serotonin receptors is
essential expression, ligand binding, receptor function. also,
glycosylation cellular receptors reported important jcv
infection. therefore, hypothesized 5-ht(2a)r n-linked glycosylation
sites required jcv infection. treatment 5-ht(2a)r-expressing cells
with tunicamycin, inhibitor n-linked glycosylation, reduced jcv infection. 
individual mutation five n-linked glycosylation sites not
affect capacity 5-ht(2a)r support jcv infection alter the
cell surface expression receptor. however, mutation five n-linked
glycosylation sites simultaneously reduced capacity 5-ht(2a)r support
infection altered cell surface expression. similarly, tunicamycin
treatment reduced cell surface expression 5-ht(2a)r. mutation five 
n-linked glycosylation sites tunicamycin treatment cells expressing
wild-type 5-ht(2a)r resulted altered electrophoretic mobility profile of
the receptor. treatment cells pngase f, remove n-linked
oligosaccharides cell surface, affect jcv infection in
5-ht(2a)r-expressing cells. data affirm importance 5-ht(2a)r a
jcv receptor demonstrate sialic acid component receptor is
not directly linked 5-ht(2a)r.
