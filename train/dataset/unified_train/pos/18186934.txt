background: previously identified unusual variants moloney friend
ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses altered host range cytopathic
in cells wild mouse species mus dunni. cytopathicity attributed to
different amino acid substitutions critical env residue involved in
receptor interaction: s82f moloney variant spl574, s84a friend 
mouse leukemia virus f-s mlv. m. dunni cells carry variant cat-1 cell
surface virus receptor (dcat-1), examined role receptor variant in
cytopathicity host range.
results: expressed dcat-1 mcat-1 nih 3t3 origin cells not
normally infectible ecotropic mlvs evaluated transfectants for
susceptibility virus infection virus-induced syncytium formation. the
dcat-1 transfectants, mcat-1 transfectants, susceptible to
virus-induced cytopathicity, cytopathic response accompanied 
accumulation unintegrated viral dna. dcat-1 transfectants, however, did
not also reproduce relative resistance m. dunni cells moloney mlv, 
the mcat-1 transfectants show relative resistance nih 3t3 cells to
spl574. western analysis, use glycosylation inhibitors mutagenesis to
remove receptor glycosylation sites identified possible role cell-specific 
glycosylation modulation virus entry.
conclusion: virus entry virus-induced syncytium formation using cat-1
receptor mediated small number critical amino acid residues in
receptor virus env. virus entry modulated glycosylation cellular
proteins, effect cell virus-specific.
