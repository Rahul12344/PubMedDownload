the influenza virus neuraminidase (na) protein primarily aids release of
progeny virions infected cells. here, demonstrate novel role na 
enhancing host cell survival activating src/akt signaling axis via an
interaction carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule
6/cluster differentiation 66c (c6). na/c6 interaction leads increased
tyrosyl phosphorylation src, fak, akt, gsk3Î², bcl-2, affects cell
survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis.
sirna-mediated suppression c6 resulted down-regulation activated src, 
fak, akt, increased apoptosis, reduced expression viral proteins and
viral titers influenza virus-infected human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial and
normal human bronchial epithelial cells. findings indicate influenza
na aids release progeny virions, also cell survival during
viral replication.
