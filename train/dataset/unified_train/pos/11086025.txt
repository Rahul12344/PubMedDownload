hepatitis c virus (hcv) important human pathogen remarkably
efficient establishing persistent infection. hcv core protein first
protein expressed early phase hcv infection. previous work
demonstrated hcv core protein suppresses host immune responses,
including anti-viral cytotoxic t-lymphocyte responses murine model. to
investigate mechanism hcv core-mediated immunosuppression, searched for
host proteins capable associating core protein using yeast
two-hybrid system. using core protein bait, screened human t
cell-enriched expression library identified gene encoding gc1q receptor
(gc1qr). c1q ligand gc1qr involved early host defense
against infection. like c1q, hcv core inhibit t-cell proliferative responses 
in vitro. core-induced anti-t-cell proliferation reversed addition 
anti-gc1qr ab t-cell proliferation assay. furthermore, biochemical analysis 
of interaction core gc1qr indicates hcv core binds the
region spanning amino acids 188 259 gc1qr, site distinct binding
region c1q. inhibition t-cell responsiveness hcv core may have
important implications hcv persistence humans.
