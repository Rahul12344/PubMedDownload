in human skin fibroblasts microinjected purified human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 protease (hiv-1 pr), stress fibers lost alterations in
nuclear morphology condensation nuclear chromatin observed.
thereafter, vimentin intermediate filament (if) network collapsed. effect 
was seen microtubules. complicated loss affected cells from
the substratum, minimum estimate proportion cells demonstrating these
effects 50%. observation single cells demonstrated effects 
largely irreversible steps leading death hiv-1 pr-injected
cells. microinjection various dilutions hiv-1 pr, observed
that changes nuclear morphology chromatin condensation detectable
under conditions little effect observed stress fibers and
the network. proteins cells labelled [35s]methionine microinjected
with either hiv-1 pr bsa subjected two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis. major differences gel patterns diminution in
the amount vimentin appearance novel products comigrating with
cleavage products obtained treatment vimentin hiv-1 pr vitro.
thus, hiv-1 pr capable cleaving subunit proteins vivo,
but also catalyze alterations cellular structures.
