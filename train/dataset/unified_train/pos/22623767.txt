bglf4 epstein-barr virus (ebv) encodes serine/threonine protein kinase 
phosphorylates multiple viral cellular substrates optimize cellular
environment viral dna replication nuclear egress viral
nucleocapsids. bglf4 expressed predominantly nucleus early late 
stages virus replication, small portion bglf4 distributed the
cytoplasm late stage virus replication packaged virion.
here, analyzed systematically functional domains crucial nuclear
localization bglf4 found n c termini play important
modulating roles. analysis amino acid substitution mutants revealed c
terminus bglf4 contain conventional nuclear localization signal
(nls). additionally, deletion c-terminal putative helical regions amino
acids 386 393 410 419 diminished nuclear translocation bglf4,
indicating secondary structure c terminus important the
localization bglf4. green fluorescent protein-fused wild-type or
c-terminal helical regions bglf4 associate phenylalanine/glycine
repeat-containing nucleoporins (nups) nuclear envelope fractionation. both
coimmunoprecipitation vitro pull-down assays demonstrated that
bglf4 binds nup62 nup153. remarkably, nuclear import assay with
permeabilized hela cells demonstrated bglf4 translocated nucleus
independent cytosolic factors. data presented suggest bglf4 employs 
a novel mechanism direct interactions nucleoporins nuclear
targeting.
