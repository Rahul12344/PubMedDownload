fibrinogen-beta (fbg-beta), important acute-phase protein (app), generated 
by liver target inflammatory mediators. identified fbg-beta 
as hepatitis c virus (hcv) core interacting protein screening human liver 
complementary dna (cdna) library using mammalian two-hybrid analysis. an
association fbg-beta hcv core protein verified confocal
microscopy coimmunoprecipitation transfected human hepatocyte
(huh-7) cell line. hcv core genomic rna transfected huh-7 cells modestly
increased fbg-beta protein expression compared basal level control
hepatocytes. transfection hcv core full-length (fl) gene huh-7 cells
up-regulated basal fbg-beta promoter activity. exogenous addition il-6
stimulates fbg-beta promoter activity hepatocytes. however, ectopic expression
of hcv core fl hepatocytes inhibited il-6-stimulated fbg-beta promoter
activation. inhibition endogenous fbg-beta expression following introduction
of small interfering rna (sirna) cells displayed gain function of
promoter regulation hcv core protein. studies suggested hcv core 
gene expression stable transfectants huh-7 cells resulted basal
up-regulation fbg-beta apps. however, treatment cytokines,
interleukin-6 (il-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha repressed fbg-beta other
acute-phase response (apr) genes.conclusion: results reveal the
core/fbg-beta interaction may act regulatory feedback, allowing repression
of il-6-stimulated apr genes. together, data suggested network of
interactions hcv core hepatic apr genes, may contribute to
impaired innate immunity viral persistence.
