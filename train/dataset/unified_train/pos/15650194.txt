human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (hiv-2) generally considered capable of
using broad range coreceptors. since hiv-2 variants individuals with
nonprogressive infection studied previously, possibility broad 
coreceptor usage property variants associated progressive infection 
could excluded. test this, determined coreceptor usage 43
hiv-2 variants isolated six long-term-infected individuals undetectable
plasma viremia. using ghost indicator cells, showed first time that
the coreceptors efficiently used low-pathogenic hiv-2 variants ccr5, 
gpr15 (bob), cxcr6 (bonzo). surprisingly, control hiv-2 variants (n = 45)
isolated seven viremic individuals also mainly used three coreceptors,
whereas use ccr1, ccr2b, ccr3 rare. nearly quarter hiv-2
variants tested could infect parental ghost cells, could partially
explained cxcr4 usage. use cxcr4 observed hiv-2 variants 
viremic individuals. thirty-eight variants aviremic viremic
hiv-2-infected individuals additionally tested u87 cells. except one 
were capable infecting parental u87 cells, often high efficiency.
when virus production parental cells regarded background the
coreceptor-transduced cell lines, results u87 cells largely in
agreement findings ghost cells. hiv-2 isolates aviremic
individuals commonly use coreceptors ccr5, gpr15, cxcr6, well an
unidentified receptor expressed u87 cells. broad coreceptor usage, therefore, 
does appear associated pathogenicity hiv-2.
