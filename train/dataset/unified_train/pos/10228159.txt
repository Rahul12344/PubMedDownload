e7 main transforming protein human papilloma virus type 16 (hpv16)
which implicated formation cervical cancer. transforming
activity e7 attributed interaction retinoblastoma
(rb) tumour suppressor. however, rb binding sufficient transformation 
by e7. mutations within zinc finger domain, dispensable rb
binding, also abolish e7 transformation functions. show hpv16 e7
associates histone deacetylase vitro vivo, via zinc finger
domain. using genetic screen, identify mi2beta, component recently 
identified nurd histone deacetylase complex, protein binds directly 
the e7 zinc finger. zinc finger point mutant unable bind mi2beta
and histone deacetylase still able bind rb fails overcome cell cycle
arrest osteosarcoma cells. results suggest binding histone
deacetylase complex important parameter growthpromoting activity of
the human papilloma virus e7 protein. provides first indication that
viral oncoproteins control cell proliferation targeting deacetylation
pathways.
