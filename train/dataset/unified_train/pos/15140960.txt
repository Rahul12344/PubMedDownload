in previous reports demonstrated nipah virus v w proteins
have interferon (ifn) antagonist activity due ability block signaling
from ifn-alpha/beta receptor (j. j. rodriguez, j. p. parisien, c. m.
horvath, j. virol. 76:11476-11483, 2002; m. s. park et al., j. virol.
77:1501-1511, 2003). v, w, p proteins encoded viral
gene share identical 407-amino-acid n-terminal region distinct
c-terminal sequences. show p protein also anti-ifn function, 
confirming common n-terminal domain responsible antagonist
activity. truncation n-terminal domain revealed amino acids 50 to
150 retain ability block ifn bind stat1, key component ifn
signaling pathway. subcellular localization studies demonstrate v p 
proteins predominantly cytoplasmic whereas w protein localized 
nucleus. cases, stat1 colocalizes corresponding nipah virus
protein. interactions sufficient inhibit stat1 activation, as
demonstrated lack stat1 phosphorylation tyrosine 701 in
ifn-stimulated cells expressing p, v, w. therefore, despite common
stat1-binding domain, nipah virus v p proteins act retaining stat1 
the cytoplasm w protein sequesters stat1 nucleus, creating 
a cytoplasmic nuclear block stat1. also show ifn antagonist
activity p protein strong v w, perhaps explaining 
why nipah virus evolved express two edited products.
