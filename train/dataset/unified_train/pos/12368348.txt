pact, protein activator pkr, cause inhibition cellular protein
synthesis apoptosis. here, report us11 protein herpes simplex 
virus type 1 block pkr activation pact vitro vivo. although
us11 bind pkr pact, mutational analyses revealed binding
of us11 pkr, pact, essential inhibitory action. similar
analyses also revealed inhibitory effect mediated interaction 
between c-terminal half us11 n-terminal domain pkr. binding
of us11 pkr block binding pkr pact prevented its
activation. us11 first example viral protein inhibit the
action pact pkr.
