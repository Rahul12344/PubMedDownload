hepatitis delta virus (hdv) subviral human pathogen uses specific rna
editing activity host produce two essential forms sole viral
protein, hepatitis delta antigen (hdag). editing amber/w site hdv
antigenomic rna leads production longer form (hdag-l), is
required rna packaging potent trans-dominant inhibitor hdv 
rna replication. editing infected cells thought catalyzed one or
more cellular enzymes known adenosine deaminases act rna
(adars). examined effects increased adar1 adar2 expression hdv
rna editing replication transfected huh7 cells. found adars
dramatically increased rna editing, correlated strong inhibition
of hdv rna replication. increased hdag-l production primary
mechanism inhibition, observed least two additional means adars
can suppress hdv replication. high-level expression adar1 adar2 led
to extensive hyperediting non-amber/w sites subsequent production hdag 
variants acted trans-dominant inhibitors hdv rna replication.
moreover, also observed weak inhibition hdv rna replication mutated
forms adars defective deaminase activity. results indicate hdv
requires highly regulated selective editing level adar
expression play important role: overexpression adars inhibits hdv rna
replication compromises virus viability.
