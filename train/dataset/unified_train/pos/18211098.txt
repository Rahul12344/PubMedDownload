hepatitis e virus (hev) nonenveloped plus-stranded rna virus major
cause acute hepatitis many developing countries. recent work shown hev 
may endemic developed countries also. 5' two-thirds 7.2 kb
single-stranded rna genome hev encodes orf1, 3' end encodes the
structural proteins orf2 orf3. orf1 nonstructural protein involved 
viral rna synthesis, orf2 major capsid protein, whereas orf3 very
small protein 123 amino acids. precise cellular functions orf3
protein remain obscure, although postulated viral regulatory 
protein. elucidate role orf3 viral pathogenesis, yeast
two-hybrid system used screen human liver cdna library proteins
interacting orf3. one orf3-interacting partners thus isolated and
identified hemopexin, 60 kda acute-phase plasma glycoprotein high
binding affinity heme. two-hybrid result validated vitro
pull-down co-immunoprecipitation assays finally intracellular
fluorescence resonance energy transfer. using deletion mapping approach, the
hydrophobic domain ii orf3 (spanning amino acids 37 62) found be
responsible binding hpx, amino acids 63 77 possibly contributing
to strength interaction. biological significance this
interaction virus life cycle discussed.
