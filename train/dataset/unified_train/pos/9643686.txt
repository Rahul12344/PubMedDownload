background: human milk contains 46 kda mucin-associated glycoprotein,
lactadherin, binds specifically rotavirus inhibits replication. 
this study tested hypothesis lactadherin protects symptoms of
rotavirus infection.
methods: 200 infants mexico city recruited birth monitored by
regular stool eia rotavirus, serology, recording feeding stool
patterns. milk samples obtained mothers weekly 4 weeks post
partum monthly. sample taken immediately infant's episode of
rotavirus infection assayed lactadherin, butyrophilin, mucin, and
secretory iga. infection defined symptomatic diarrhoea occurred in
the 5 days detection virus.
findings: 31 infants developed rotavirus infection; 15 symptomatic 16
had symptoms. median concentration lactadherin milk samples
(obtained 4-41 days [median 13] infection) 48.4 (range 5.6-180)
microg/ml asymptomatic group 29-2 (6.2-103-4) microg/ml the
symptomatic group. although medians differ significantly, in
logistic regression analysis adjusted age infection secretory iga
concentration significant difference groups (p=0o01). 
association symptom status concentrations butyrophilin, mucin, 
secretory iga found.
interpretation: protection rotavirus human milk associated the
glycoprotein lactadherin. association independent products the
secretory immune system.
