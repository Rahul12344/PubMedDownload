the macrophage-tropic lentivirus, equine infectious anemia virus (eiav), encodes 
the small auxiliary protein s2 short open reading frame overlaps 
amino terminus env eiav s2 dispensable virus replication cultured
cells required disease production. s2 approximately 7 kda has
no overall amino acid sequence homology cellular viral proteins.
therefore likely s2 plays role adaptor protein. further
investigate s2 function performed yeast-2-hybrid screen identify cellular
proteins interact eiav s2. screen identified two human cellular
proteins, amplified osteosarcoma (os-9) proteasome 26s atpase subunit 3
(psmc3) interact s2. equine homologues proteins were
cloned interactions s2 confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation
assays. identified two os-9 isoforms interact s2 third splice 
variant not, indicating region os-9 apparently required s2
interaction. roles cellular proteins eiav infection 
been determined.
