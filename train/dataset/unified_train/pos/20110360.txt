stathmin important microtubule (mt)-destabilizing protein, activity
is differently attenuated phosphorylation one four
phosphorylatable serine residues (ser-16, ser-25, ser-38, ser-63). this
phosphorylation stathmin plays important roles mitotic spindle formation.
we observed increasing levels phosphorylated stathmin epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-harboring lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls) nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(npc) cell lines ebv lytic cycle. suggest ebv lytic
products may involved regulation stathmin phosphorylation. bglf4 
an ebv-encoded kinase similar kinase activity cdc2, important
kinase phosphorylates serine residues 25 38 stathmin mitosis. 
using sirna approach, demonstrated bglf4 contributes the
phosphorylation stathmin ebv-harboring npc. moreover, confirmed that
bglf4 interacts phosphorylates stathmin using vitro kinase assay
and vivo two-dimensional electrophoresis assay. interestingly, unlike cdc2,
bglf4 shown phosphorylate non-proline directed serine residues stathmin
(ser-16) mediated phosphorylation stathmin predominantly serines 16,
25, 38, indicating bglf4 down-regulate activity stathmin.
finally, demonstrated pattern mt organization changed in
bglf4-expressing cells, possibly phosphorylation stathmin. in
conclusion, shown viral ser/thr kinase directly modulate the
activity stathmin contributes alteration cellular mt dynamics
and may modulate associated cellular processes.
