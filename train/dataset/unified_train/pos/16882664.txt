the clinical manifestations west nile virus (wnv), member flavivirus 
family, include febrile illness, sporadic encephalitis, paralysis. capsid
(cp) wnv thought participate processes inducing apoptosis
through mitochondrial dysfunction activation caspase-9 caspase-3. to
further identify molecular mechanism wnv capsid protein (wnvcp), yeast
two-hybrid assays employed using wnv-cp bait. jab1, fifth subunit 
the cop9 signalosome, subsequently identified molecule interacts
with wnvcp. immunoprecipitation glutathione s-transferase pulldown assays
confirmed direct interaction could occur wnvcp jab1.
immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated overexpressed wnvcp, which
localized nucleolus, translocated cytoplasm upon its
co-expression jab1. treated leptomycin b, jab1-facilitated nuclear
exclusion wnvcp prevented, indicated crm1 complex is
required jab1-facilitated nuclear export wnvcp. moreover, jab1 promoted
the degradation wnvcp proteasome-dependent way. consistent this,
wnvcp-mediated cell cycle arrest g(2) phase h1299 prevented by
exogenous jab1. finally, analysis wnvcp deletion mutants indicated the
first 15 amino acids required interaction jab1. furthermore, the
double-point mutant wnvcp, p5a/p8a, incapable binding jab1.
these results indicate jab1 potential protective effect against
pathogenic wnvcp might provide novel target site treatment of
disease caused wnv.
