pten (phosphatase tensin homolog deleted chromosome 10) mast2
(microtubule-associated serine threonine kinase 2) interact other
through pdz domain mast2 (mast2-pdz) carboxyl-terminal
(c-terminal) pdz domain-binding site (pdz-bs) pten. two proteins
function negative regulators cell survival pathways, silencing of
either one promotes neuronal survival. human neuroblastoma cells infected with
rabies virus (rabv), c-terminal pdz domain viral glycoprotein (g
protein) target mast2-pdz, rabv infection triggers neuronal survival a
pdz-bs-dependent fashion. findings suggest pten-mast2 complex
inhibits neuronal survival viral g protein disrupts complex through
competition pten binding mast2-pdz. showed c-terminal
sequences pten viral g protein bound mast2-pdz similar
affinities. nuclear magnetic resonance structures complexes exhibited
similar large interaction surfaces, providing structural basis their
binding specificities. additionally, viral g protein promoted nuclear
exclusion pten infected neuroblastoma cells pdz-bs-dependent manner
without altering total pten abundance. findings suggest formation of
the pten-mast2 complex specifically affected viral g protein and
emphasize disruption critical protein-protein interaction regulates
intracellular pten trafficking. turn, data show viral protein
might used decipher underlying molecular mechanisms clarify 
the subcellular localization pten regulates neuronal survival.
