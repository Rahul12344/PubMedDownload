cellular homeoproteins shown regulate transcription several
viruses, including herpes simplex viruses, human papillomaviruses, mouse
mammary tumor viruses. previous studies investigating anti-viral mechanisms
of several cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors showed homeoproteins, pre 
b-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (pbx1) pbx-regulating protein-1
(prep1), function transcriptional activators moloney murine leukemia virus.
here, examined involvement cellular homeoproteins regulating the
activity human cytomegalovirus immediate early (cmv ie) promoter. we
identified 45-bp element located position -593 -549 upstream the
transcription start site cmv ie gene, contains multiple putative
homeoprotein binding motifs. gel shift assays demonstrated physical
association homeodomain protein, pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 
(pdx1) 45-bp cytomegalovirus (cmv) region. determined that
pdx1 represses cmv ie promoter activity 293 cells. overexpression pdx1 
resulted decrease transcription cmv ie gene. conversely, blocking 
pdx1 protein synthesis mutating pdx1 binding sites enhanced cmv
ie-dependent transcription. collectively, results represent first work
demonstrating cellular homeoprotein, pdx1, may repressor involved 
regulation human cmv gene expression.
