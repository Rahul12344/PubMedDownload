as transcription factors, gata-1 activities mediated interactions
with multiple proteins. identified far associate zinc-finger
domain and/or surrounding sequences. contrast, proteins interacting with
the n-terminal domain identified although several evidences suggest its
involvement control hematopoiesis. attempt identify proteins
that interact n-terminal transactivation domain gata-1, random
phage peptide library screened recombinant gata-1 protein the
sequence selected peptide used database protein sequence retrieval. 
we selected set peptides sharing core sequence phi-b((2-3))-nu((2-4))
(where phi, b, nu represent hydrophobic, basic, neutral residues,
respectively). using sequence represented peptide (pep5) as
query, retrieved hiv accessory protein nef. show nef binds gata-1 
and gata-3 vitro virtue sequence homology pep5.
