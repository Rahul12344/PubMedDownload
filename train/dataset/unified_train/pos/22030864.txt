interplay host human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) pivotal role in
the outcome infection. region (referred ul/b') present toledo
strain hcmv low passage clinical isolates contains 19 additional genes,
which absent highly passaged laboratory strain ad169. products 
ul/b' genes may determine manifestations hcmv infection vivo. however, 
little known host factors, interact ul/b' proteins. 
study conducted investigate function hcmv ul136 protein. by
yeast two-hybrid screening, Î²1 subunit host na+/k+-atpase (atp1b1) was
identified candidate protein, interacts hcmv ul136
protein. interaction evaluated vitro pull-down assay
and vivo immunofluorescent co-localization. results showed the
ul136 protein interact atp1b1 vitro. co-localization ul136-egfp
and atp1b1-dsred cell membranes suggests atp1b1 partner the
ul136 protein. proposed hcmv ul136 protein may important 
roles processes cell-to-cell spread, maintaining cell osmotic
pressure intracellular ion homeostasis hcmv infection.
