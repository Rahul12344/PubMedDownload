the tax protein encoded human t-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) a
pivotal role t-cell transformation deregulating cellular signalling
pathways. using yeast two-hybrid system screen human leukocyte cdna
library, identified bcl6 (b-cell lymphoma 6) cellular protein, which
interacts tax 1. bcl6 gene encodes sequence-specific transcriptional
repressor contains conserved n-terminal poxvirus zinc finger (poz)
repressor domain c-terminal kruppel-like zinc finger dna binding domain.
using vivo vitro methods, demonstrate poz domain of
bcl6 sufficient interaction tax 1. using functional assays, we
demonstrate tax 1 enhanced repressive activity bcl6 increased the
levels apoptosis induced bcl6 osteosarcoma cells indicating both
proteins cooperate vivo cause physiological affect. furthermore, bcl6
recruited tax 1 punctate nuclear structures, suggests tax 1
colocalizes bcl6 repressor complexes vivo. bcl6 expression
significantly downregulated basal tax-induced nuclear factor-kappab 
long terminal repeat activation. suggests expression bcl6 in
htlv infected cells may contribute silencing viral gene expression 
to long clinical latency associated htlv infection.
