enterovirus 71 (ev71) major causative agent hand, foot mouth disease 
(hfmd), common febrile disease occurring mainly young children. although
clinical manifestations hfmd usually mild self limiting, severe ev71
outbreak lead diverse array neurological diseases. identification 
the specific cellular receptors crucial elucidating mechanism early
virus-host interactions pathogenesis enteroviruses. identify
human p-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (psgl-1; cd162), sialomucin membrane
protein expressed leukocytes major role early stages of
inflammation, functional receptor ev71 using expression cloning
method panning. n-terminal region psgl-1 binds specifically ev71.
stable psgl-1 expression allowed ev71 entry replication, development of
cytopathic effects nonsusceptible mouse l929 cells. five eight ev71
strains bound soluble psgl-1 used intact psgl-1 primary receptor for
infection jurkat cells. three ev71 strains use psgl-1,
suggesting presence strain-specific replication ev71 leukocytes.
ev71 replicated nonleukocyte cell lines psgl-1-independent manner,
indicating presence alternative receptor(s) ev71. identification
of psgl-1 receptor ev71 sheds new light role psgl-1-positive
leukocytes cell tropism pathogenesis course hfmd other
ev71-mediated diseases.
