the latency-associated nuclear antigen (lana) encoded kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) critical segregation viral
episomes progeny nuclei allows maintenance viral genome in
newly divided daughter cells. lana binds kshv terminal repeat (tr) dna and
simultaneously associates chromatin-bound cellular proteins. process
tethers viral episomes host chromosomes. however, mechanism of
tethering complex involves multiple protein-protein interactions. our
previous proteomics studies showed association lana centromeric
protein f (cenp-f) prompted us study whether lana targets centromeric 
proteins persistence kshv episomes cell division. show that
lana colocalized cenp-f speckles, paired centromeric
regions subset chromosomes kshv-infected jsc-1 cells. also confirm 
that amino carboxy termini lana bind cenp-f. moreover,
lana associated another kinetochore protein, bub1 (budding uninhibited by
benzimidazole 1), known form complex cenp-f. importantly, we
demonstrated dynamic association lana bub1/cenp-f the
colocalization bub1, lana, kshv episome tethered host
chromosome using fluorescence situ hybridization (fish). knockdown bub1
expression lentivirus-delivered short hairpin rna (shrna) dramatically reduced
the number kshv genome copies, whereas dramatic effect seen cenp-f
knockdown. therefore, interaction lana kinetochore proteins
cenp-f bub1 important kshv genome tethering segregation new
daughter cells, bub1 potentially playing critical role the
long-term persistence viral genome infected cell.
