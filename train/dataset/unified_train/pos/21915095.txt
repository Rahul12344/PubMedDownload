transport cargoes kinesin-1 essential many cellular processes.
nevertheless, number proteins known recruit kinesin-1 via cargo
binding light chain (klc) still quite small. also know relatively little
about molecular features define kinesin-1 binding. show a
bipartite tryptophan-based kinesin-1 binding motif, originally identified in
calsyntenin present a36, vaccinia integral membrane protein. this
bipartite motif a36 required kinesin-1-dependent transport virus
to cell periphery. bioinformatic analysis reveals related bipartite
tryptophan-based motifs present 450 human proteins. using vaccinia as
a surrogate cargo, show regions proteins containing motif can
function recruit klc promote virus transport absence a36. 
proteins interact kinesin light chain outside context infection
and distinct preferences klc1 klc2. observations demonstrate
that klc binding conferred common set features found a
wide range proteins associated diverse cellular functions human
