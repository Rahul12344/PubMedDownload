human polyomavirus jc virus (jcv) causative agent progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy results lytic infection glial cells. although
significant progress made understanding regulation jcv gene
transcription, mechanism(s) underlying viral lytic cycle remains largely 
unknown. recently reported jcv late auxiliary agnoprotein may 
regulatory role jcv gene transcription replication. here, investigated 
its regulatory function viral gene transcription physical and
functional interaction yb-1, cellular transcription factor which
contributes jcv gene expression glial cells. time course studies revealed
that agnoprotein first detected day 3 postinfection level
increased late stage infection cycle. agnoprotein mainly
localized cytoplasmic compartment infected cell, high
concentrations found perinuclear region. position agnoprotein
throughout infection cycle remained relatively unaltered, subcellular
distribution yb-1 cytoplasm nucleus changed. results from
coimmunoprecipitation glutathione s-transferase pull-down experiments
revealed agnoprotein physically interacts yb-1 the
amino-terminal region agnoprotein, residues 1 36, critical 
this association. investigation interaction functional assays 
demonstrated agnoprotein negatively regulates yb-1-mediated gene
transcription region corresponding residues 1 36 of
agnoprotein important observed regulatory event. taken together, these
data demonstrate interaction viral late regulatory agnoprotein
and cellular y-box binding factor yb-1 modulates transcriptional activity jcv 
promoters.
