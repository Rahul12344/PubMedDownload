the nss protein bunyamwera virus (bunyaviridae) antiapoptotic interferon
antagonist involved silencing host protein expression interfering mrna
synthesis. here, show ability inhibit host transcription 
the interferon response linked interaction nss med8 component
of mediator, protein complex necessary mrna production. interacting
domain nss mapped c-terminal region, contains amino acids
conserved among orthobunyavirus nss proteins. recombinant virus the
interacting domain nss deleted strongly reduced ability inhibit
host protein expression unable inhibit interferon response. this
study provides information mechanisms bunyavirus
nonstructural proteins involved pathogenesis.
