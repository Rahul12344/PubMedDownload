the kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv)-encoded latency-associated
nuclear antigen (lana) known modulate viral cellular gene expression.
we show lana directly associates interleukin-6 signal transducer,
signal transducer activator transcription 3 (stat3) lana enhances
the transcriptional activity stat3. coimmunoprecipitation studies documented a
physical interaction lana stat3 transiently transfected 293t cells
as well kshv-infected primary effusion lymphoma (pel) cell line.
furthermore, small-interfering rna-mediated reduction lana expression
decreased stat3-dependent transcription kshv-positive pel cells, whereas
overexpression lana enhanced stat3 activity kshv-negative b lymphoma cells.
these data demonstrate lana transcriptional co-activator stat3, 
may implications pathogenesis kshv-associated diseases.
