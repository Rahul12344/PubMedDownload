problem: ccl20/mip3alpha chemokine immature dendritic cells well as
an antibacterial gram-positive gram-negative bacteria. role of
ccl20/mip3alpha antiviral unknown. study, examined the
production ccl20/mip3alpha epithelial cells upper female
reproductive tract well activity antiviral molecule.
method study: primary uterine fallopian tube epithelial cells treated
with poly(i:c) ccl20/mip3alpha mrna protein measured realtime
rt-pcr elisa assays. anti-hiv activity determined using indicator cell
line tzm-bl quantified using luminometer.
results: primary uterine fallopian tube epithelial cells produce
ccl20/mip3alpha constitutively production enhanced following
stimulation viral double-stranded rna mimic poly(i:c). recombinant
ccl20/mip3alpha able inhibit t-cell-tropic x4/iiib and
macrophage-tropic r5/bal hiv-1 virus directly incubated with
ccl20/mip3alpha ccl20/mip3alpha added cells either prior to
infection post-infection. suggests mechanism inhibition is
likely direct interaction hiv-1 ccl20/mip3alpha.
conclusion: study demonstrates ccl20/mip3alpha important
endogenous anti-hiv-1 microbicide female reproductive tract.
