influenza virus matrix protein 1 (m1) shown play crucial role in
the virus replication, assembly budding. identified heat shock cognate
protein 70 (hsc70) m1 binding protein immunoprecipitation maldi-tof
ms. c terminal domain m1 interacts hsc70. found hsc70 does
not correlate transport m1 nucleus, however, inhibit
the nuclear export m1 np, thus resulting inhibition viral
production. first demonstration hsc70 directly associated
with m1 therefore required viral production.
