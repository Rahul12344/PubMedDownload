hvs (herpesvirus saimiri) prototype gamma-2 herpesvirus. a
subfamily herpesviruses gaining importance since identification the
first human gamma-2 herpesvirus, kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. hvs
orf 57 (open reading frame 57) protein multifunctional transregulatory
protein homologous genes identified classes herpesviruses. recent 
work demonstrated orf 57 ability bind viral rna, shuttles
between nucleus cytoplasm promotes nuclear export viral
transcripts. present study, show orf 57 shuttles the
nucleus cytoplasm crm-1 (chromosomal region maintenance 1)-independent
manner. orf 57 interacts mrna export factor ref (rna export factor) 
two components exon junction complex, y14 magoh. association
of orf 57 ref stimulates recruitment cellular mrna export factor tap 
(tip-associated protein), hvs infection triggers relocalization ref
and tap nuclear speckles several large clumps within cell. using 
a dominant-negative form tap rna interference deplete tap, show that
it essential bulk mrna export mammalian cells required orf
57-mediated viral rna export. furthermore, show disruption tap
reduces viral replication. results indicate hvs utilizes orf 57 to
recruit components exon junction complex subsequently tap promote
viral rna export cellular mrna export pathway.
