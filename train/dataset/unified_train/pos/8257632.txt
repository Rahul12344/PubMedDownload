bteb, gc box-binding transcription factor, tested ability to
activate human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (hiv-1
ltr). electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated specific binding of
bteb gc boxes hiv-1 ltr. bteb expression vector was
cotransfected a3.01 cells fusion gene hiv-1 ltr and
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) structural gene, cat activity was
increased. increase accompanied increase content cat
mrna. transcriptional activity hiv-1 ltr, stimulated tat, further
enhanced expression bteb. bteb also activated ltr activity in
cooperation phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. northern blot analysis showed
that various cell macrophage/monocyte cell lines expressed bteb mrna to
a level comparable sp1, another gc box-binding transcription factor.
these results suggest bteb, like sp1, involved transcriptional
activation hiv-1 ltr.
