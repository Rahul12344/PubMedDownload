poxviruses encode numerous proteins inhibit apoptosis, form cell death 
critical elimination virally infected cells. sequencing deerpox 
virus genome revealed dpv022, protein lacks obvious homology cellular
members bcl-2 family shares limited regions amino acid identity
with two unique poxviral inhibitors apoptosis, m11l f1l. given limited
homology, sought determine whether dpv022 could inhibit apoptosis. 
show dpv022 localized mitochondria, inhibited apoptosis. 
used saccharomyces cerevisiae model system demonstrate absence
of bcl-2 family proteins, dpv022 interacted directly bak bax. 
we confirmed ability dpv022 interact bak bax by
immunoprecipitation showed dpv022 prevented apoptosis induced bak and
bax overexpression. moreover, showed dpv022 blocked apoptosis even when
all endogenous mammalian antiapoptotic proteins neutralized a
combination selective bh3 ligands. virus infection, dpv022 interacted
with endogenous bak bax prevented conformational activation both
of them. thus, characterized novel poxviral inhibitor apoptosis with
intriguing amino acid differences well-studied proteins m11l f1l.
