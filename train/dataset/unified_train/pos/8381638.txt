glucose oxidase peroxidase (lactoperoxidase myeloperoxidase) virucidal
to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) presence sodium iodide, 
as assessed loss viral replication syncytium-forming assay by
the inhibition cytopathic effects infected cells. presence low
concentrations sodium iodide, five hiv-1 isolates equally susceptible 
this virucidal system enzyme concentrations milliunits. loss of
viral replication linearly related time incubation enzyme
solutions, inactivation rate 1 log unit every 30 min. enzymes
and halide also cytotoxic chronically infected, to
uninfected, cultured cem cells. protein conjugates prepared using the
enzymes murine antibody 105.34, recognized v3 loop hiv-1 lai
isolate surface glycoprotein, recombinant human cd4. protein conjugates
inactivated free virus rates similar free enzymes were
more effective antibody recombinant cd4 alone. vitro findings
demonstrate peroxidase-h2o2-halide system provides potent virucidal
activity hiv-1.
