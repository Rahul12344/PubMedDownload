pyrin domain (pyd) proteins recently emerged important signaling
molecules involved development innate immunity intracellular
pathogens activation inflammatory mediator pathways. asc the
central adaptor protein, links pathogen recognition pyd-containing
pathogen recognition receptors activation downstream effectors,
including activation caspase-1 nf-kappab. cellular pyd-only protein 1 
(cpop1) block recruitment asc activated pan receptors thereby
functions endogenous inhibitor pyd-mediated signal transduction
pathway. describe identification characterization shope
fibroma homolog cpop1. like cpop1, shope fibroma virus-encoded pop (vpop),
co-localizes directly associates asc inhibits pyd-mediated signal
transduction. poxviruses known encode immune evasive proteins promote
host cell infection suppression host immune response. poxvirus-encoded
vpops represent novel class immune evasive proteins impair host
response blocking cryopyrin asc inflammasome-mediated activation of
pro-caspase-1 subsequent processing pro-interleukin (il)-1beta, and
expression vpops causes activation nf-kappab.
