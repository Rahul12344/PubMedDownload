the epstein-barr virus latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) oncoprotein causes
multiple cellular changes, including induction epidermal growth factor
receptor (egfr) expression activation nf-kappab transcription factor. 
lmp1 cellular protein cd40, also induces egfr expression, interact 
with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (traf) proteins. the
lmp1 carboxy-terminal activation region 1 signaling domain interacts specifically
with trafs essential egfr induction mechanism
independent nf-kappab alone. lmp1 cd40 share common traf binding motif, 
pxqxt. study, pxqxt motifs lmp1 cd40 altered and
mutant proteins analyzed induction egfr expression. replacement of
the residue cd40 completely blocked induction egfr, 
same mutation lmp1 affect egfr induction. replacement p q 
residues a's lmp1 reduced egfr induction >75%, deletion pxqxt
blocked egfr induction. results genetically link egfr induction lmp1 
the traf signaling pathway. overexpression traf2 potently activates nf-kappab,
although traf2 induce expression egfr either alone in
combination traf1 traf3. vivo analyses interaction the
trafs lmp1 variants mutated pxqxt domain indicate high-level
induction egfr expression requires interaction traf1, -2, -3.
however, exogenous expression traf3 decreased egfr induction mediated by
either lmp1 cd40. data suggest traf-mediated activation egfr
expression requires assembly complex containing appropriate
stoichiometry traf proteins clustered cell membrane lmp1.
