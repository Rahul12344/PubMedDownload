latent membrane protein 2a (lmp2a) expressed latent epstein-barr virus
(ebv) infection. demonstrated nedd4 family ubiquitin-protein ligases
(e3s), aip4, wwp2/aip2, nedd4, bind specifically two py motifs present
within lmp2a amino-terminal domain. study, lmp2a py motif mutant
viruses constructed investigate role lmp2a py motifs. aip4 was
found specifically associate lmp2a py motifs ebv-transformed
lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls), extending original observation to
ebv-infected cells. mutation lmp2a py motifs resulted an
absence binding aip4 lmp2a, resulted increase the
expression lyn constitutive hyperphosphorylation lmp2a an
unknown 120-kda protein. addition, modest increase the
constitutive phosphorylation syk unidentified 60-kda protein. these
results indicate py motifs contained within lmp2a important in
regulating phosphorylation ebv-infected lcls, likely regulation of
lyn activity specifically targeting degradation lyn ubiquination 
nedd4 family e3s. despite differences py motif mutant lcls wild-type 
lcls, py motif mutants still exhibited block b-cell receptor (bcr)
signal transduction measured induction tyrosine phosphorylation 
bzlf1 expression following bcr activation. ebv-transformed lcls mutations in
the py motifs different wild-type lcls serum-dependent cell
growth. protein stability lmp1, colocalizes lmp2a, affected
by lmp2a-associated e3s.
