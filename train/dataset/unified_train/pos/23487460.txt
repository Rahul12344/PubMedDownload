epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces impose multiple barriers viral
infection. ocular surface, carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3
maintains barrier function cross-linking transmembrane mucins apical
glycocalyx. despite defense mechanisms, many viruses evolved to
exploit fundamental cellular processes host cells. here, use affinity
assays show herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1), hsv-2, binds
human galectin-3. knockdown galectin-3 human corneal keratinocytes small
interfering rna significantly impaired hsv-1 infection, expression of
nectin-1, indicating galectin-3 herpesvirus entry mediator.
interestingly, exposure epithelial cell cultures transmembrane mucin
isolates decreased viral infectivity. moreover, hsv-1 failed elute the
biological counterreceptor muc16 galectin-3 affinity columns, suggesting
that association transmembrane mucins galectin-3 provides protection
against viral infection. together, results indicate hsv-1 exploits
galectin-3 enhance virus attachment host cells support protective
role transmembrane mucins physiological conditions masking viral
entry mediators epithelial glycocalyx.
