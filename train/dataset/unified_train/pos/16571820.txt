glycoprotein c (gc) herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) type 2 (hsv-2)
binds complement component c3b protects virus complement-mediated
neutralization. differences complement interacting domains exist gc of
hsv-1 (gc1) hsv-2 (gc2), since amino terminus gc1 blocks complement c5
from binding c3b, gc2 fails interfere activity. we
previously reported neutralization hsv-1 gc-null virus hsv
antibody-negative human serum requires activation c5 downstream
components classical complement pathway. report, evaluated
whether activation c5 sufficient neutralize hsv-2 gc-null virus, or
whether formation membrane attack complex c6 c9 required for
neutralization. found activation classical complement pathway up
to c5 sufficient neutralize hsv-2 gc-null virus hsv antibody-negative
human serum. evaluated mechanisms complement activation occurred 
in seronegative human serum. interestingly, natural immunoglobulin antibodies
bound virus, triggered activation c1q classical complement
pathway. hsv antibody-negative sera obtained four individuals differed 
an approximately 10-fold range potency complement-mediated virus
neutralization. findings indicate humans differ ability of
their innate immune systems neutralize hsv-1 hsv-2 gc-null virus a
critical function gc1 gc2 prevent c5 activation.
