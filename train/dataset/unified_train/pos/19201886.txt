ebv persists life human host facing vigorous antiviral responses
that induced upon primary infection. persistence supports idea 
herpesviruses acquired dedicated functions avoid immune elimination. 
recently identified ebv gene product bnlf2a blocks tap. result, reduced
amounts peptides transported tap cytoplasm the
endoplasmic reticulum (er) lumen binding newly synthesized hla class i
molecules. thus, bnlf2a perturbs detection cytotoxic cells. 60-aa-long
bnlf2a protein prevents binding peptides atp tap, yet 
mechanistic insight is, date, lacking. study, report ebv
bnlf2a represents membrane-associated protein colocalizes target 
tap subcellular compartments, primarily er. cells devoid tap,
expression levels bnlf2a protein greatly diminished, er localization
of remaining bnlf2a retained. interactions bnlf2a hla
class peptide-loading complex, presence tap2 essential, whereas
tapasin dispensible. importantly, show b cells supporting ebv
lytic replication, bnlf2a protein expressed early infection,
colocalizing associating peptide-loading complex. results
imply that, productive ebv infection, bnlf2a contributes tap inhibition
and surface hla class down-regulation. way, ebv bnlf2a-mediated evasion
from hla class i-restricted cell immunity contributes creating window 
undetected virus production.
