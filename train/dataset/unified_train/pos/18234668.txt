the ability human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (hiv-1) protein nef to
induce cytoskeleton changes infected host cells key event viral
replication. renal podocytes, found nef induced loss stress fibers 
and increased lamellipodia, pathological changes leading proteinuria in
hiv-associated nephropathy. morphological changes mediated by
nef-induced rac1 activation rhoa inhibition. identified new interaction 
between nef diaphanous interacting protein (dip), recently described
regulator rho rac signaling. found src homology 3 binding
domain dip nef pxxp motif required interaction. nef also
interacts vav2 podocytes. dip vav2 interact directly nef in
a competitive manner. dip interacts p190rhogap, intact dip required 
for nef-induced phosphorylation p190rhogap. dip also interacts vav2, 
although dip enhanced baseline phosphorylation vav2, required for
nef-induced vav2 activation. nef-infected podocytes, src kinase induces
phosphorylation dip, p190rhogap, vav2, leading rhoa inhibition rac1
activation. inhibition nef-induced signaling pathway using dominant
negative either src dip sirna dip p190rhoagap restored rhoa
activity stress fiber formation nef-infected podocytes, whereas sirna 
vav2 reduced rac1 activity formation lamellipodia. conclude in
hiv-infected podocytes, nef, recruitment dip p190rhoagap to
nef-src complex, activates p190rhoagap down-regulates rhoa activity.
