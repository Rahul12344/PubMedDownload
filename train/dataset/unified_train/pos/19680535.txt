small nucleolar rnas (snornas) localized within nucleolus, sub-nuclear 
compartment, guide ribosomal spliceosomal rna modifications,
respectively. now, snornas identified eukaryal and
archaeal genomes, notably absent bacteria. screening b lymphocytes 
for expression non-coding rnas (ncrnas) induced epstein-barr virus
(ebv), report, first time, identification snorna gene
within viral genome, designated v-snorna1. genetic element displays all
hallmark sequence motifs canonical c/d box snorna, namely c/c'- well as
d/d'-boxes. nucleolar localization v-snorna1 verified situ
hybridisation ebv-infected cells. also confirmed binding three
canonical snorna proteins, fibrillarin, nop56 nop58, v-snorna1. c-box 
motif v-snorna1 shown crucial stability viral snorna;
its selective deletion viral genome led complete down-regulation of
v-snorna1 expression levels within ebv-infected b cells. provide
evidence v-snorna1 might serve mirna-like precursor, processed
into 24 nt sized rna species, designated v-snorna1(24pp). potential target
site v-snorna1(24pp) identified within 3'-utr balf5 mrna which
encodes viral dna polymerase. v-snorna1 found expressed all
investigated ebv-positive cell lines, including lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcl). 
interestingly, induction lytic cycle markedly up-regulated expression
levels v-snorna1 30-fold. computational approach, identified a
v-snorna1 homolog rhesus lymphocryptovirus genome. evolutionary
conservation suggests important role v-snorna1 gamma-herpesvirus
infection.
