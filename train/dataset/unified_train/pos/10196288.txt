herpes simplex virus infection initiated vp16, viral transcription factor
that activates viral immediate-early (ie) genes. vp16 recognize 
ie gene promoters directly instead forms multiprotein complex oct-1
and hcf-1, ubiquitous nuclear protein required progression g1
phase cell cycle. functional significance recruiting hcf-1 the
vp16-induced complex understood. describe identification 
second hcf-like protein, designated hcf-2. hcf-2 smaller hcf-1 shares
three regions strong amino acid sequence homology, including the
beta-propeller domain required association vp16. hcf-2 expressed in
many tissues, especially testis, shows dynamic pattern of
subcellular localization hcf-1. although hcf-2 associates vp16 
support complex assembly oct-1 dna, significantly less efficient
than hcf-1. similar preference shown lzip, cellular counterpart of
vp16. analysis chimeric proteins showed differences fifth and
sixth kelch repeats beta-propeller domains hcf-1 hcf-2 dictate
this selectivity. results reveal unexpected level specificity 
recruitment hcf-1 vp16-induced complex, paralleling preferential
selection oct-1 rather closely related pou domain protein oct-2.
implications regulation viral life cycle discussed.
