understanding issue specificity imposed interactions sh3 domains
has largely addressed studies investigating interaction of
proline-rich amino acid sequences derived potential ligands these
domains. although interaction motif forms essential platform 
the binding sh3 domains, many cases little specificity observed 
difference affinity so-called specific nonspecific proline-rich
sequences great. furthermore, binding interface sh3 domain 
and protein ligand appears encompass interactions represented 
by involving proline-rich motif. investigate issue of
specificity opposite point view; namely, ligand recognize 
different sh3 domains? present crystal structure unbound sh3 domain
from hemopoietic cell kinase (hck) member src family of
tyrosine kinases. structure reveals that, unlike structures src
kinase sh3 domains, rt loop region highly mobile lacks network of
hydrogen bonds elsewhere apparent. rt loop shown form a
major part binding interface sh3 domains hiv-1 nef.
thermodynamic data, derived isothermal titration calorimetry, the
binding hck sh3 hiv-1 nef show binding hck (kd = 1.5 microm) is
approximately order magnitude tighter src family
kinases investigated (fyn, lck, src). increase affinity 
attributed to, among effects, inherent flexibility rt loop which
does require breaking network hydrogen bonds adopt conformation
required binding.
