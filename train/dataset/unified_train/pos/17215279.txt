the dp71l protein african swine fever virus (asfv) shares sequence similarity 
with herpes simplex virus icp34.5 protein c-terminal domain. showed
that catalytic subunit protein phosphatase 1 (pp1) interacts specifically 
with asfv dp71l protein yeast two-hybrid screen. chimeric
full-length dp71l protein, asfv strain badajoz 71 (ba71v), fused to
glutathione s-transferase (dp71l-gst) expressed escherichia coli shown
to bind specifically pp1-alpha catalytic subunit expressed histidine 
fusion protein (6xhis-pp1alpha) e. coli. functional effects this
interaction investigated measuring levels pp1 pp2a in
asfv-infected vero cells. showed infection wild-type asfv strain
ba71v activated pp1 two- threefold mock-infected cells. 
this activation occur cells infected ba71v isolate which
the dp71l gene deleted, suggesting expression dp71l leads pp1
activation. contrast, effect observed activity pp2a following
asfv infection. showed infection cells wild-type ba71v virus
resulted decreased phosphorylation alpha subunit eukaryotic
initiation factor 2 (eif-2alpha). icp34.5 recruits pp1 dephosphorylate the
alpha subunit eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (also known as
eif-2alpha); possibly asfv dp71l protein similar function.
