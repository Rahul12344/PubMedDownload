human mxa, interferon-inducible cytoplasmic dynamin-like gtpase, possesses
antiviral activity multiple rna viruses. recently, mxa also been
demonstrated activity hepatitis b virus (hbv), well-known
dna virus responsible acute chronic liver disease humans. we
investigated molecular mechanism anti-hbv activity mxa. our
results demonstrated hepg2.2.15 cells, mxa gtpase independently
suppressed production hepatitis b surface antigen hbv dna without
changing level hepatitis b core antigen (hbcag) distribution of
hbv mrna. mxa significantly reduced level encapsidated pregenomic rna.
through central interactive domain, mxa interacted hbcag, causing
accumulation proteins perinuclear compartments. mxa-hbcag interaction
significantly affected dynamics hbcag immobilizing hbcag the
perinuclear structures.conclusion: mxa displays antiviral activity hbv
involving mechanism mxa-hbcag interaction may interfere core
particle formation.
