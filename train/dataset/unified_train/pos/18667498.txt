accumulating evidence suggests cellular lipoprotein components involved 
in hepatitis c virus (hcv) morphogenesis, precise contribution these
components remains unclear. investigated involvement apolipoprotein c1 
(apoc1) hcv infection hcv pseudotyped particle system (hcvpp), the
recently developed cell culture infection model (hcvcc), authentic hcv
isolated viremic chimpanzees. viral genomes associated hcvcc or
authentic hcv efficiently immunoprecipitated anti-apoc1, demonstrating
that apoc1 normal component hcv. infectivities hcvpp had
been mixed apoc1 and, importantly, untreated hcvcc collected from
lysates media infected huh7.5 cells directly neutralized by
anti-apoc1. indeed, convalescent anti-hcv immunoglobulin g anti-apoc1 each
neutralized 75% infectious hcvcc particles, indicating many, 
all, infectious particles recognized antibodies. moreover, peptides 
corresponding c-terminal region apoc1 blocked infectivity hcvpp
and hcvcc. altogether, results suggest apoc1 associates
intracellularly via c-terminal region surface components virions
during viral morphogenesis may play major role replication cycle 
hcv.
