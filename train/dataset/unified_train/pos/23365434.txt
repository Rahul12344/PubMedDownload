activation host dna damage response (ddr) essential dna replication
of minute virus canines (mvc), member genus bocavirus the
parvoviridae family; however, mechanism ddr contributes viral dna
replication unknown. current study, demonstrate mvc infection
triggers intra-s-phase arrest slow host cellular dna replication 
to recruit cellular dna replication factors viral dna replication. the
intra-s-phase arrest regulated atm (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase)
signaling p53-independent manner. moreover, demonstrate smc1
(structural maintenance chromosomes 1) key regulator the
intra-s-phase arrest induced infection. either knockdown smc1 or
complementation dominant negative smc1 mutant blocks the
intra-s-phase arrest viral dna replication. finally, show the
intra-s-phase arrest induced mvc infection caused neither damaged
host cellular dna viral proteins replicating viral genomes
physically associated dna damage sensor, mre11-rad50-nbs1 (mrn)
complex. conclusion, feedback loop mvc dna replication the
intra-s-phase arrest mediated atm-smc1 signaling plays critical role 
in mvc dna replication. thus, findings unravel mechanism underlying ddr
signaling-facilitated mvc dna replication demonstrate novel strategy dna
virus-host interaction.
