crk-associated substrate lymphocyte type (cas-l) docking protein is
heavily tyrosine phosphorylated engagement beta1 integrins cells. 
in present study, attempted evaluate role cas-l the
pathophysiology adult t-cell leukemia (atl). examination peripheral blood
mononuclear cells atl patients well atl-derived cell lines showed an
elevation cas-l cells. showed tyrosine phosphorylation as
well expression cas-l markedly elevated induction human 
t-lymphotropic virus type (htlv-i) tax jpx-9 cells, cells showing
marked motile behavior ligands integrins. next performed yeast
two-hybrid screening cdna library htlv-i-transformed cell line,
which resulted identification tax putative binding partner for
cas-l. co-precipitation experiments revealed serine-rich region cas-l
might serve binding site highest affinity tax.
co-localization study showed tax cas-l partly merged cytoplasm.
finally, showed exogenous cas-l inhibited tax-mediated transactivation of
nuclear factor kappab (nf-kappab), tax-independent activation nf-kappab 
remained intact, hence indicating cas-l might specifically regulate
tax-nf-kappab pathway.
