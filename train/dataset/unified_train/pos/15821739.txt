human cytomegalovirus, chief pathogen immunocompromised people, persist 
in healthy immunocompetent host throughout life without eliminated the
immune system. show pp65, main tegument protein human
cytomegalovirus, inhibited natural killer cell cytotoxicity interaction
with activating receptor nkp30. interaction direct specific,
leading dissociation linked cd3zeta nkp30 and, consequently, to
reduced killing. thus, pp65 ligand nkp30 receptor demonstrates a
unique mechanism intracellular viral protein causes general
suppression natural killer cell cytotoxicity specific interaction an
activating receptor.
