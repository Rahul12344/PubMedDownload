replication assembly hepatitis c virus (hcv) depend host's
secretory lipid-biosynthetic machinery. viral replication occurs on
endoplasmic reticulum (er)-derived modified membranes, viral assembly is
thought occur lipid droplets (lds). physical association coordination
between viral replication assembly complexes prerequisites for
efficient viral production. nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a), localizes both
to er lds, ideal candidate function. here, interaction
of ns5a host cell membranes binding partners characterized living
cells. binding ns5a lds apparently irreversible, in
hcv-infected cells ectopically expressed. hcv-infected cells, ns5a
fluorescence observed around lds perinuclear structures 
incorporated highly immobile platform superimposed er membrane.
moreover, tbc1d20 cognate gtpase rab1 recruited ns5a lds. the
ns5a-tbc1d20 interaction shown essential viral life cycle. in
cells, expression rab1 dominant negative (rab1dn) gtpase mutant abolished 
steady-state lds. infected cells, rab1dn induced elimination ns5a 
viral replication sites. results demonstrate significance the
localization ns5a lds support model whereby interaction with
tbc1d20 rab1 affects lipid droplet metabolism promote viral life
cycle.
