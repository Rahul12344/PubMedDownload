we describe cloning env genes mother-infant hiv-1 isolate pair
p6-v3 m6-v3. viruses unusual use coreceptor
bonzo/strl33 well ccr5 and, case m6, cxcr4, enter transfected 
cell lines vitro. phenotype parental isolates generally
reflected properties cloned env genes, used an
env-complementation assay virus entry. chimeric viruses also made that
contain env genes p6-v3 m6-v3 inserted background the
infectious molecular clone, hiv-1 nl4-3. chimeric viruses derived
from hiv1 p6-v3 able use bonzo entry transfected cell lines,
albeit lesser extent could use ccr5. indications
that one chimeric viruses, p6-v3-22-1, use coreceptor than
ccr5, perhaps bonzo, enter mitogen-stimulated pbmc, although weakly.
however, formal proof virus use bonzo primary cells been
obtained. p6-v3-22-1 chimeric virus unable infect cd4-negative,
placental cell lines, presence absence soluble cd4. env sequence
analysis revealed several differences among viruses different tropisms, most
notably four amino acid deletion central region v3 loop that
distinguishes r5 virus p6-v3-25-4 r5, bonzo virus p6-v3-22-1.
