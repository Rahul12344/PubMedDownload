the human papillomavirus type 16 (hpv-16) e7 gene encodes multifunctional
oncoprotein subvert multiple cellular regulatory pathways. the
best-known cellular targets hpv-16 e7 oncoprotein retinoblastoma
tumor suppressor protein prb related pocket proteins p107 p130.
however, ample evidence e7 additional cellular targets that
contribute transforming potential. isolated hpv-16 e7 associated
cellular protein complexes tandem affinity purification mass spectrometry 
and identified 600-kda retinoblastoma protein associated factor, p600, a
cellular target e7. association e7 p600 independent pocket
proteins mediated n terminal e7 domain, related to
conserved region 1 adenovirus e1a protein importantly contributes to
cellular transformation independent prb binding. depletion p600 protein
levels rna interference substantially decreased anchorage-independent growth
in hpv-positive -negative human cancer cells. therefore, p600 cellular
target e7 regulates cellular pathways contribute to
anchorage-independent growth cellular transformation.
