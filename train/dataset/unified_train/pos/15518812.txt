the viral proteins a1l, a2l, g8r, h5r positively modulate vaccinia virus late
gene expression. host-encoded proteins hnrnp a2 rbm3 may also interact with
these viral factors influence late gene expression. studies, yeast 
two-hybrid screen vitro pulldown crosslinking experiments used to
investigate protein--protein interactions among factors. studies
confirmed previous observation g8r interacts a1l. however,
self-interactions a1l h5r, interactions a2l g8r, a2l and
h5r, h5r g8r also observed. addition, proteins hnrnp a2 and
rbm3 showed interaction a2l. illustration interactions is
a step toward understanding architecture late gene transcription
complex occurs poxviruses.
