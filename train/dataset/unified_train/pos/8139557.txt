the herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1) origin dna replication, oris, contains
an at-rich region three highly homologous sequences, sites i, ii, iii,
identified binding sites hsv-1 origin-binding protein (obp). the
present study, interactions specific oris dna sequences proteins in
uninfected cell extracts characterized. formation one predominant
protein-dna complex, m, demonstrated gel shift assays following incubation
of uninfected cell extracts site dna. cellular protein(s) that
comprises complex designated origin factor (of-i). of-i binding 
site shown partially overlap obp binding site within site i. complexes
with mobilities indistinguishable complex also formed site ii
and iii dnas gel shift assays. oris-containing plasmid dna mutated of-i
binding site exhibited reduced replication efficiency transient assays,
demonstrating role site oris function. of-i binding site is
highly homologous binding sites cellular ccaat dna-binding proteins.
the binding site ccaat protein cp2 found compete of-i binding 
to site dna. studies support model involving participation of
cellular proteins initiation hsv-1 dna synthesis oris.
