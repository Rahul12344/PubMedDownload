affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry (ap-ms) using selective
antibodies target protein commonly applied study protein
complexes. however, one major limitation lack specificity a
substantial part proposed binders due nonspecific interactions.
here, describe innovative immuno-competitive capture mass spectrometry
(icc-ms) method allow systematic investigation protein-protein
interactions. icc-ms markedly increases specificity classical
immunoprecipitation (ip) introducing competition step free and
capturing antibody prior ip. instead comparing one experimental sample
with control, methodology generates 12-concentration antibody competition
profile. label-free quantitation followed robust statistical analysis the
data used extract cellular interactome protein interest
and filter background proteins. applied new approach to
specifically map interactome hepatitis c virus (hcv) nonstructural protein
5a (ns5a) cellular hcv replication system uncovered eight new
ns5a-interacting protein candidates along two previously validated binding
partners. follow-up biological validation experiments revealed large tumor
suppressor homolog 1 2 (lats1 lats2, respectively), two closely related
human protein kinases, novel host kinases responsible ns5a
phosphorylation highly conserved position required optimal hcv genome
replication. results first illustration value icc-ms
