we demonstrate phosphorylation ns1 protein human influenza a
virus occurs threonine (t) position 215 also serines
(ss), specifically positions 42 48. generating recombinant influenza
a/udorn/72 (ud) viruses encode mutant ns1 proteins, determined roles 
of phosphorylations virus replication. position 215 t-to-a
substitution attenuated replication, whereas substitutions (t e mimic
constitutive phosphorylation, n, p, amino acid avian
influenza virus ns1 proteins) effect. conclude attenuation
resulting t-to-a substitution position 215 attributable a
deleterious structural change ns1 protein caused other
amino acid substitutions phosphorylation t215 affect virus
replication. position 48 neither s-to-a substitution s-to-d
substitution mimics constitutive phosphorylation affected virus replication.
in contrast, position 42, s-to-d, s-to-a, substitution caused
attenuation. s-to-d substitution eliminates detectable double-stranded rna
binding ns1 protein, accounting attenuation virus replication. we
show protein kinase c α (pkcα) catalyzes s42 phosphorylation. consequently, 
the phosphorylation ns1 protein human influenza virus 
regulates replication s42 phosphorylation catalyzed pkcα. contrast, 
phosphorylation ts ss ns1 protein 2009 h1n1 pandemic virus
was detected, indicating ns1 phosphorylation probably play 
role replication virus.
