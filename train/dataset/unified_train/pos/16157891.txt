adeno-associated virus rep78 protein antiproliferative effects cells. it
inhibits cell cycle progression, and, particular, rep78 induces complete
arrest within phase, response rarely seen cell dna damage. examined 
how rep78 achieves efficient phase block. rep78 inhibits cdc25a
activity novel means binding two proteins stabilizes
cdc25a, thus increasing abundance, time preventing access
to substrates cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 cdk1. effect alone
does induce complete phase block. addition, rep78, well rep68,
produces nicks cellular chromatin, inducing dna damage response mediated
by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (atm) leading g(1) g(2) blocks.
mutational analysis shows zinc finger domain nuclease activity of
rep78 required phase block. results suggest true 
phase block cannot achieved single pathway, that
adeno-associated virus rep78 protein arrests cells within phase interfering 
with two pathways would normally lead phase slow-down.
