the epstein-barr nuclear antigen 3c (ebna3c), one essential latent
antigens epstein-barr virus (ebv)-induced immortalization primary human b 
lymphocytes vitro, implicated regulating cell proliferation and
anti-apoptosis via interaction several cellular viral factors. gemin3
(also named ddx20 dp103) member dead rna helicase family which
exhibits diverse cellular functions including dna transcription, recombination
and repair, rna metabolism. gemin3 initially identified binding
partner ebna2 ebna3c. however, mechanism ebna3c regulates
gemin3 function remains unclear. here, report ebna3c directly interacts
with gemin3 c-terminal domains. interaction results increased
stability gemin3 accumulation b lymphoma cells ebv
transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (lcls). moreover, ebna3c promotes formation
of complex p53 gemin3 blocks dna-binding affinity p53.
small hairpin rna based knockdown gemin3 b lymphoma lcl cells remarkably
attenuates ability ebna3c inhibit transcription activity p53 
its downstream genes p21 bax, well apoptosis. findings provide
the first evidence gemin3 may common target oncogenic viruses for
driving cell proliferation anti-apoptotic activities.
