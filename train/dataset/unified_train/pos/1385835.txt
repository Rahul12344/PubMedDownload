sindbis virus alphavirus wide host range, able infect 
many birds mammals well mosquitoes. isolated monoclonal
antibody largely blocks virus binding mammalian cells. antibody 
found directed c-terminal domain high-affinity laminin
receptor, 67-kda protein present cell surface binds high
affinity basement membrane laminin known important in
development tumor invasion. receptor believed formed 
295-amino-acid polypeptide modified unknown way after
translation. primary sequence 295-amino-acid protein highly
conserved among mammals. found hamster amino acid sequence identical
to mouse sequence differ two amino acids human sequence
and two amino acids bovine sequence. verify importance the
laminin receptor infection sindbis virus, hamster cells stably
transfected gene encoding 295-amino-acid protein control
of high-efficiency promoter. transfected hamster cells overexpressed the
laminin receptor cell surface, bound severalfold sindbis virions than
did parental cells, became infected sindbis virus higher
efficiency. contrast, cells transfected antisense gene expressed less
laminin receptor surface less susceptible virus. binding
of virus varied linearly amount laminin receptor cell
surface, whereas infectivity measured plaque assay varied 1.4
power receptor concentration, suggesting interaction than
one receptor aids virus penetration. criteria, laminin receptor
functions major receptor sindbis virus entry mammalian cells. 
also found anti-laminin receptor antibody partially blocked sindbis
virus binding mosquito cells, suggesting laminin receptor is
conserved mosquitoes functions sindbis virus receptor host.
the wide distribution highly conserved receptor may part
responsible broad host range exhibited virus, infects wide
range mammals birds well mosquito vector infect many
different tissues within hosts.(abstract truncated 400 words)
