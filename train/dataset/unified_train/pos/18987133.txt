upon viral infection, major defense mounted host immune system is
activation interferon (ifn)-mediated antiviral pathway, mediated 
by ifn regulatory factors (irfs). order complete life cycle, viruses 
must modulate host ifn-mediated immune responses. despite association with
significant human health problems, activities epstein-barr virus (ebv), a
human tumor-inducing herpesvirus, evade host ifn-mediated innate immunity have
not well characterized. search ebv genes block ifn signal
transduction, carried screening ebv open reading frames their
abilities block ifn-alpha/beta-mediated luciferase expression upon sendai
virus infection. screening demonstrates ebv lf2 tegument protein
specifically interacts central inhibitory association domain irf7,
and interaction leads inhibition dimerization irf7, which
suppresses ifn-alpha production ifn-mediated immunity. demonstrates a
novel immune evasion mechanism ebv lf2 blocking cellular irf7-mediated
innate immunity.
