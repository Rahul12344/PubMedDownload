viral proteins gamma-2 herpesviruses, lmp2a epstein barr virus
(ebv) tip herpesvirus saimiri (hvs) dysregulate lymphocyte signaling by
interacting src family kinases. k15 open reading frame kaposi's sarcoma
associated herpesvirus (kshv), located right end viral genome,
encodes several splicing variants differing numbers transmembrane domains. 
previously, demonstrated cytoplasmic tail k15 protein
interfered b cell receptor signal transduction cellular tyrosine
phosphorylation calcium mobilization. however, detailed mechanism
underlying phenomenon understood. c-terminal cytoplasmic
region k15, putative binding domains src-sh2 -sh3 identified. 
this study, attempted characterize modular elements cellular
binding protein(s) gst pull co-immunoprecipitation assays. these
studies revealed k15 interacted major b cell tyrosine kinase lyn.
in vitro kinase transient co-expression assays showed expression 
k15 protein resulted activation lyn kinase activity. addition, gst pull 
down assay suggested sh2 domain lyn alone necessary for
interaction c-terminal sh2b (yeev) k15, addition lyn sh3
to sh2 domain increases binding affinity k15 protein. data from
luciferase assays indicate k15 expression bjab cells induced nfat ap1
activities. tyrosine residue c-terminal end k15 required the
lyn interaction appeared essential nfat/ap1 activation, highlighting
the significance c-terminal sh2b k15 modular element in
interfering b lymphocyte signaling interaction lyn kinase.
