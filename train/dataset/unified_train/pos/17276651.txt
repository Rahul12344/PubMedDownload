enterovirus 71 (ev71) major etiological agent hand, foot mouth
disease (hfmd). several outbreaks east asia associated neurological 
complications numerous deaths. ev71 possesses four structural proteins
vp1-vp4 necessary formation pentameric icosahedral capsid.
the viral capsid contributes virulence, vp1 prime target ev71
vaccine development. using yeast two-hybrid analysis, demonstrated binding
affinity vp1 three human proteins, i.e. ornithine decarboxylase
(odc1), gene trap ankyrin repeat (gtar), kiaa0697 expressed brain tissue. 
these interactions authenticated co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 
by indirect immunofluorescent confocal microscopy transfected and
ev71-infected vero cells. significant interaction vp1 odc1 may
compromise latter's activity, interfere polyamine biosynthesis,
growth proliferation ev71-infected cells. interaction vp1 
gtar noteworthy, since ankyrin proteins associated certain neural
cell adhesion molecules crash neurological syndrome. given vp1 
is synthesized large amounts productive infection, viral-host
protein interactions may provide insights role vp1 the
pathogenesis ev71 disease neurological complications acute
flaccid paralysis encephalitis.
