the interaction human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) nef with
p21-activated kinase 2 (pak2) proposed play important role in
t-cell activation disease progression viral infection. however, the
mechanism nef activates pak2 poorly understood. mutations nef
motifs previously reported required pak2 activation (g2, pxxp72, and
rr105) also affect nef functions, cd4 major histocompatibility
complex class (mhc-i) downregulation. better understand nef interactions
with pak2, performed mutational analysis three primary hiv-1 nef clones
that exhibited similar capacities downregulation cd4 mhc-i but
variable abilities associate activated pak2. results demonstrate that
nef amino acids positions 85, 89, 187, 188, 191 (l, h, s, r, f 
clade b consensus, respectively) critical pak2 association. mutation of
these nef residues dramatically altered association pak2 without affecting
nef expression levels cd4 mhc-i downregulation. furthermore, compensation 
occurred positions 89 191 amino acids substituted. since
residues 85, 89, 187, 188, 191 cluster surface nef core domain 
in region distinct dimerization sh3-binding domains, propose
that nef residues form part unique binding surface specifically
involved association pak2. binding surface includes exposed and
recessed hydrophobic residues may participate as-yet-unidentified
protein-protein interaction facilitate pak2 activation.
