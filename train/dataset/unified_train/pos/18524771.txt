many viruses subvert host ubiquitin-proteasome system optimize life 
cycle. recently documented mechanism human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 vpr protein, promotes cell cycle arrest recruiting the
dcaf1 adaptor cul4a-ddb1 ubiquitin ligase, finding confirmed by
several groups. examined impact cul4a-ddb1(dcaf1) vpr
stability. show vpr(q65r) mutant, defective dcaf1
binding, undergoes proteasome-mediated degradation higher rate than
wild-type vpr. dcaf1 overexpression stabilizes wild-type vpr leads its
cytoplasmic accumulation, whereas effect vpr(q65r) mutant.
conversely, small interfering rna-mediated silencing dcaf1 decreases the
steady state amount viral protein. stabilization dcaf1, is
conserved vpr species human immunodeficiency virus type 2 sivmac 
strain, results increased g(2) arrest requires presence ddb1,
indicating occurs assembly vpr functional
cul4a-ddb1(dcaf1) complex. furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus type
1-infected cells, vpr protein, issued incoming viral particle, is
destabilized dcaf1 ddb1 silencing. together previous findings, 
our data suggest cul4a-ddb1(dcaf1) acts dual level providing vpr
with equipment degradation specific host proteins by
counter-acting proteasome targeting another cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase. 
this protection mechanism may represent efficient way optimize activity
of vpr molecules delivered incoming virus neosynthesis
takes place. targeting vpr-dcaf1 interaction might therefore present
therapeutic interest.
