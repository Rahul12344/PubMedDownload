fcp1, phosphatase specific carboxyl-terminal domain largest
subunit rna polymerase ii, regulated hiv-1 tat protein, ck2, tfiib, 
and large subunit tfiif (rap74). characterized interactions of
tat rap74 brct-containing central domain fcp1
(fcp1(562)(-)(738)). demonstrated fcp1 required tat-mediated
transactivation vitro amino acids 562-685 fcp1 necessary for
tat interaction yeast two-hybrid studies. sequence alignments, we
identified conserved acidic/hydrophobic region fcp1 adjacent highly
conserved brct domain. vitro binding studies purified proteins indicate
that hiv-1 tat interacts acidic/hydrophobic region brct
domain fcp1, whereas rap74(436)(-)(517) interacts solely portion the
acidic/hydrophobic region containing conserved lxxll-like motif. hiv-1 tat
inhibits binding rap74(436)(-)(517) fcp1. companion paper (k.

following ck2 phosphorylation, biochemistry 44, 2732-2745, identified novel 
ck2 site adjacent conserved lxxll-like motif. phosphorylation of
fcp1(562)(-)(619) ck2 site increases binding rap74(436)(-)(517),
but phosphorylation inhibited tat. results provide insights into
the mechanisms tat inhibits fcp1 ctd phosphatase activity by
which fcp1 mediates transcriptional activation tat. addition increasing 
our understanding role hiv-1 tat transcriptional regulation, this
study defines clear role regions adjacent brct domain promoting
important protein-protein interactions.
