the hbx oncoprotein hepatitis b virus accredited one the
protagonists driving hepatocarcinogenesis. hbx exerts influence the
cell cycle progression potentiating activity cyclin a/e-cdk2 complex,
the cyclin partner well-known target cellular deubiquitinase
usp37. present study, observed intracellular accumulation cyclin
a usp37 proteins hbx microenvironment. flow cytometry analysis of
the hbx-expressing cells showed deregulation cell cycle apparently due 
enhanced gene expression stabilization usp37 protein deubiquitination 
of cyclin usp37. co-immunoprecipitation confocal microscopic studies
suggested direct interaction usp37 hbx. interaction promoted
the translocation usp37 outside nucleus prevented association 
ubiquitination e3 ubiquitin ligases - apc/cdh1 scf/Î²-trcp. thus, hbx seems
to control cell cycle progression via cyclin a-cdk2 complex regulating
the intracellular distribution stability deubiquitinase usp37.
