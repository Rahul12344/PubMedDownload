both full-length subgenomic negative-strand rnas initiated 3'
terminus positive-strand genomic rna arterivirus, simian
hemorrhagic fever virus (shfv). shfv 3'(+) non-coding region (ncr) 76 nts 
in length forms stem loop (sl) structure confirmed ribonuclease
structure probing. two cell proteins, p56 p42, bound specifically probe 
consisting shfv 3'(+)ncr rna. 3'(+)ncr rnas two additional members 
of arterivirus genus specifically interacted two cell proteins the
same size. p56 identified polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (ptb) and
p42 identified fructose bisphosphate aldolase a. ptb binding sites were
mapped terminal loop bulged region shfv 3'sl structure.
deletion either ptb binding sites viral rna significantly
reduced ptb binding activity, suggesting sites required for
efficient binding protein. changes top portion shfv 3'sl
structure eliminated aldolase binding, suggesting binding site 
protein located near top sl. cell proteins may play roles 
regulating functions genomic 3' ncr.
