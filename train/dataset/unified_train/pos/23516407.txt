dengue constitutes global health concern. clinical manifestation this
disease varies mild febrile illness severe hemorrhage and/or fatal
hypovolemic shock. flavivirus nonstructural protein 1 (ns1) secreted
glycoprotein displayed surface infected cells absent 
viral particles. ns1 accumulates high levels plasma dengue virus
(denv)-infected patients, previous reports highlight involvement in
immune evasion, dengue severity, liver dysfunction pathogenesis. the
present study, performed yeast two-hybrid screen search denv2
ns1-interacting partners using human liver cdna library. identified fifty
genes, including human complement component 1 (c1q), confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation, elisa immunofluorescence assays, revealing the
first time direct binding protein ns1. furthermore, majority
of identified genes encode proteins secreted plasma of
patients, proteins classified acute-phase proteins
(apps), plasminogen, haptoglobin, hemopexin, α-2-hs-glycoprotein, retinol
binding protein 4, transferrin, c4. results presented confirm the
direct interaction denv ns1 key protein complement system and
suggest role complement protein pathogenesis denv infection.
