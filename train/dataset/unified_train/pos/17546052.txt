c-terminal-binding protein interacting protein (ctip) first isolated a
binding partner c-terminal-binding protein (ctbp). considered to
contribute transcriptional repression cell cycle regulatory properties
of retinoblastoma (rb) family proteins role cellular 
response dna damage. here, shown ctip novel target the
adenovirus oncoprotein early region 1a (ade1a). ade1a associates ctip in
both ad5e1-transformed cells ad5-infected cells binds directly in
glutathione-s-transferase pull-down assays. two binding sites mapped on
ad5e1a - n-terminal alpha-helical region (residues 1-30) conserved region
3 (cr3) - transcriptional activation domain. ctip bind ade1a ctbp
independently, raising possibility ternary complexes exist in
ad-transformed -infected cells. significantly, reduction ctip expression
with small interfering rnas results reduction ability gal4
dna-binding domain-cr3 construct transactivate gal 4-responsive luciferase
reporter effect reversed reduction ctbp expression. therefore, 
in model, ctip acts transcriptional co-activator ade1a when
dissociated ctbp, action ade1a. data consistent
with observations ctip expression induced ade1a viral infection
and reduction ctip expression rna interference retard virus
replication. addition, ade1a causes disruption ctip/rb complex during
viral infection interaction ctip, possibly contributing to
transcriptional derepression.
