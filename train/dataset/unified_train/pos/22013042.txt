nef secreted infected cells exosomes found abundance 
sera hiv-infected individuals. secreted exosomal nef (exnef) induces apoptosis
in uninfected cd4‚Å∫ cells may key component hiv pathogenesis. the
exosomal pathway implicated hiv-1 virus release, suggesting a
possible link two viral processes. however, underlying
mechanisms cellular components exnef secretion elucidated.
we previously described nef motif, secretion modification region (smr;
amino acids 66 70), required exnef secretion. silico modeling
data suggest motif form putative binding pocket. hypothesized 
that nef smr binds cellular protein involved protein trafficking and
that inhibition interaction would abrogate exnef secretion. using
tandem mass spectrometry coimmunoprecipitation novel smr-based peptide
(smrwt) blocks exnef secretion hiv-1 virus release, identified
mortalin smr-specific cellular protein. second set of
coimmunoprecipitation experiments full-length nef confirmed mortalin
interacts nef via nef's smr motif interaction disrupted 
the smrwt peptide. overexpression microrna knockdown mortalin revealed a
positive correlation exnef secretion levels mortalin protein
expression. using antibody inhibition demonstrated nef/mortalin
interaction necessary exnef secretion. taken together, work
constitutes significant step understanding underlying mechanism exnef
secretion, identifies novel host-pathogen interaction, introduces an
hiv-derived peptide antiviral properties.
