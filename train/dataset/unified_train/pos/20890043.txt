human parvovirus b19 (b19v) human pathogenic parvovirus. causes 
wide spectrum human diseases, including fifth disease (erythema infectiosum)
in children pure red cell aplasia immunocompromised patients. b19v is
highly erythrotropic preferentially replicates erythroid progenitor cells 
(epcs). current understanding b19v interacts cellular factors to
regulate disease progression limited, due lack permissive cell lines
and animal models. here, employed recently developed primary human cd36(+)
epc culture system highly permissive b19v infection identify
cellular factors lead cell cycle arrest b19v infection. found
that b19v exploited e2f family transcription factors downregulating
activating e2fs (e2f1 e2f3a) upregulating repressive e2fs (e2f4 e2f8)
in primary cd36(+) epcs. b19v nonstructural protein 1 (ns1) key viral
factor responsible altering e2f1-e2f5 expression, e2f6-e2f8
expression. interaction ns1 e2f4 e2f5 enhanced nuclear import 
of repressive e2fs induced stable g₂ arrest. ns1-induced g₂ arrest 
independent p53 activation increased viral replication. downstream
e2f4/e2f5 targets, potentially involved progression g₂ into
m phase erythroid differentiation, identified microarray analysis.
these findings provide new insight molecular pathogenesis b19v in
highly permissive erythroid progenitors.
