poliovirus translation initiated internal ribosome entry site (ires).
most likely involving action standard initiation factors, highly
structured cis element 5" noncoding region viral rna guides the
ribosome internal silent aug. actual start codon viral protein
synthesis downstream reached ribosomal scanning. study
we show two secondary structure elements poliovirus ires,
domain v and, minor extent, domain vi, determinants binding of
the eukaryotic initiation factor eif4b. several mutations domain v are
known greatly affect poliovirus growth also seriously impair binding of
eif4b. interaction eif4b ires dependent presence of
the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein, also binds poliovirus
ires. contrast weak interaction cellular mrnas, eif4b remains
tightly associated poliovirus ires formation complete 80s 
ribosomes. binding eif4b ires energy dependent, binding the
small ribosomal subunit ires requires previous energy-dependent
association initiation factors ires. results indicate 
interaction eif4b 3" region poliovirus ires may directly
involved translation initiation.
