paramyxovirus matrix (m) proteins organize virus assembly, linking viral
glycoproteins viral ribonucleoproteins together virus assembly sites on
cellular membranes. using yeast two-hybrid screening approach, identified
14-3-3 binding partner protein parainfluenza virus 5 (piv5).
binding transfected piv5-infected cells confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation mapped c-terminal region within protein,
namely, 366-ktkslp-371. sequence resembles known 14-3-3 binding sites, in
which key residue binding phosphorylated serine residue. mutation of
s369 within piv5 protein disrupted 14-3-3 binding improved budding 
of virus-like particles (vlps) recombinant viruses, suggesting that
14-3-3 binding impairs virus budding. 14-3-3 protein overexpression reduced the
budding vlps. using (33)p labeling, phosphorylated protein detected in
piv5-infected cells, phosphorylation nearly absent cells infected
with recombinant virus harboring s369a mutation within protein.
assembly protein clusters filaments infected cell surfaces
was enhanced cells infected recombinant virus defective 14-3-3
binding. findings support model portion protein within
piv5-infected cells phosphorylated residue s369, binds 14-3-3 protein, 
and held away sites virus budding.
