our pioneering studies interplay small ubiquitin-like modifier
(sumo) influenza virus identified nonstructural protein ns1 the
first known sumo target influenza virus one abundantly
sumoylated influenza virus proteins. here, characterize role of
sumoylation a/puerto rico/8/1934 (pr8) ns1 protein, demonstrating that
ns1 sumoylated sumo1 also sumo2/3 mapping main
sumoylation sites ns1 residues k219 k70. furthermore, using
sumoylatable non-sumoylatable forms ns1 ns1-specific artificial
sumo ligase (asl) increases ns1 sumoylation ~4-fold, demonstrate that
sumoylation affect stability cellular localization pr8 ns1.
however, ns1's ability sumoylated appears affect virus multiplication,
as indicated delayed growth virus expressing non-sumoylatable
form ns1 interferon (ifn)-competent mdck cell line. remarkably, a
non-sumoylatable form ns1 exhibited substantially diminished ability to
neutralize ifn production, increasing ns1 sumoylation beyond normal levels
also exerted negative effect ifn-blocking function. observation
indicates existence optimal level ns1 sumoylation allows ns1 to
achieve maximal activity suggests limited amount sumoylation
normally observed sumo targets may correspond optimal level that
maximizes contribution sumoylation protein function. finally, protein
cross-linking data suggest sumoylation may affect ns1 function regulating
the abundance ns1 dimers trimers cell.
