regulation viral transcription chromatin structure emerged a
fundamental determinant establishment lytic latent herpesvirus
infections. polycomb group (pcg) epigenetic repressors promotes
heterochromatin formation trimethylating histone h3 lysine-27 (h3k27me3)
and regulates development, stem cell renewal differentiation cell
cycle. cellular processes tightly coupled molecular switch
between lytic latent herpesvirus infections. using chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis, observed enrichment h3k27me3 major
immediate-early (mie) locus murine cytomegalovirus (mcmv) early following
infection permissive fibroblasts. lytic replication progressed, observed
a loss h3k27me3 enrichment concomitant appearance h3k4me3.
however, late infection, viral replication centers established, 
observed significant increase pcg protein association chromatin.
additionally, co-immunofluorescence assays using confocal microscopy, we
detected strong enrichments pcg protein within viral replication
compartment, suggesting association viral dna synthesis machinery 
pcg proteins. together, results suggest novel, dynamic interaction 
pcg epigenetic repressors mcmv genomes.
