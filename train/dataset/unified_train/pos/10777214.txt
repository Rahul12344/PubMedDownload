ebna-3 (also called ebna-3a) one ebv encoded nuclear antigens 
necessary b-cell transformation. ebna-3 known target rbps, nuclear
proteins also interacts ebna-2, ebna-4 ebna-6. order identify
additional ebna-3 targets, ebv-transformed human lymphocyte cdna library was
screened yeast two-hybrid system n-terminus truncated ebna-3 that
cannot interact rbp-jkappa. clone, encoding xap-2 protein, cellular
partner hepatitis b virus x-antigen isolated. protein also known
as p38 subunit aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex (ara9). specific 
binding ebna-3 confirmed showing gst-xap-2 precipitated ebna-3
from cv1 cells infected recombinant vaccinia virus expressing
ebna-3. deletion c-terminus xap-2 eliminated binding. fusion with
green fluorescent protein showed xap-2 preferentially cytoplasmic but
translocates nucleus upon expression ebna-3.
