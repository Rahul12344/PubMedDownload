sumoylation papillomavirus (pv) origin binding helicase e1 protein is
critical function. consequently, factors modulating sumoylation e1
could ultimately alter outcome papillomavirus infection. investigated
the role played phosphorylation two known sumo e3 ligases, ranbp2 pias
proteins, sumoylation e1. e1 sumoylation unaffected by
phosphorylation wild-type pseudo-phosphorylation mutants bpv e1
exhibited similar sumoylation profiles. ranbp2 bound bpv e1, hpv11 
e1, lacked sumoylation enhancing activity either e1. contrast,
proteins pias family (except piasy) bound bpv hpv11 e1 and
stimulated sumoylation. structural integrity ring finger domain 
of pias proteins required e3 sumo ligase activity pv e1
sumoylation dispensable pv e1 binding activity. miz1, pias 
protein exerting strongest e1 sumoylation enhancing activity, favored sumo1
versus sumo2 modifier shown transcribed keratinocyte
cell line. study indicates pias proteins possible modulators pv e1
sumoylation papillomavirus infections.
