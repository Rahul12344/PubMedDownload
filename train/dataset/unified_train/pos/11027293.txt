the high-risk human papillomavirus (hpv) e6 proteins stimulate ubiquitination
and degradation p53, dependent e6ap ubiquitin-protein ligase. other
proteins also shown targeted degradation e6, including
hdlg, human homolog drosophila melanogaster discs large (dlg) tumor
suppressor. show human homolog drosophila scribble
(vartul) (hscrib) tumor suppressor protein also targeted ubiquitination by
the e6-e6ap complex vitro expression e6 induces degradation of
hscrib vivo. characterization e6ap-e6-hscrib complex indicated that
hscrib binds directly e6 binding mediated pdz domains
of hscrib carboxyl-terminal epitope conserved among high-risk hpv e6
proteins. green fluorescent protein-hscrib localized periphery mdck
cells, colocalized zo-1, component tight junctions. e6
expression resulted loss integrity tight junctions, measured zo-1 
localization, effect dependent pdz binding epitope e6.
thus, high-risk hpv e6 proteins induce degradation human homologs 
of two drosophila pdz domain-containing tumor suppressor proteins, hdlg and
hscrib, associated cell junction complexes. fact 
scrib/vart dlg appear cooperate pathway controls drosophila
epithelial cell growth suggests combined targeting hscrib hdlg is
an important component biologic activity high-risk hpv e6 proteins.
