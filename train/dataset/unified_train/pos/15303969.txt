ns3, non-structural protein hcv (hepatitis c virus), contains protease
and helicase domain plays essential roles processing viral
polyprotein, viral rna replication translation. lmp7 (low-molecular-mass
protein 7), component immunoproteasome, identified ns3-binding
protein yeast two-hybrid screens, interaction confirmed in
vitro binding co-immunoprecipitation analysis. minimal domain of
interaction defined pro-sequence region lmp7 (amino
acids 1-40) protease domain ns3. elucidate biological
importance interaction, studied effect interaction ns3 
protease activity lmp7 immunoproteasome activity. recombinant lmp7 not
have effect ns3 protease activity vitro. peptidase activities of
lmp7 immunoproteasomes, however, markedly reduced tested stable
cell line containing hcv subgenomic replicon. down-regulation proteasome
peptidase activities could interfere processing viral antigens for
presentation mhc class molecules, may thus protect hcv host immune 
surveillance mechanisms allow persistent infection virus.
