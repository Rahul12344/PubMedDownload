transglutaminase 2 (tgase 2) one family enzymes catalyze protein 
modification incorporation polyamines substrates the
formation protein crosslinks. however, physiological roles tgase 2 
largely unknown. elucidate functions tgase 2, searched 
interacting proteins. show tgase 2 interacts e7 oncoprotein 
human papillomavirus type 18 (hpv18) vitro vivo. tgase 2 incorporates
polyamines conserved glutamine residue zinc-binding domain hpv18
e7 protein. modification mediates inhibition e7's rb binding ability.
in contrast, tgase 2 affect hpv16 e7, due absence glutamine
residue polyamination site. using e7 mutants, demonstrate tgase
2-dependent inhibition hpv e7 function correlates presence the
polyamination site. results indicate tgase 2 important cellular
interfering factor define novel host-virus interaction, suggesting the
inability tgase 2 inactivate hpv16 e7 could explain high prevalence 
hpv16 cervical cancer.
