hepatitis b virus (hbv) infection major health concern around world, and
only minority patients receiving current treatments achieve sustained
response following short course therapy. majority patients require
prolonged therapy suppress viral replication. however, several recent reports 
show inhibiting host-cell proteins prevent viral infection. human
epiregulin (ereg) confirmed previous study up-regulated in
hepg2.2.15 cells down-regulated lamivudine. therefore, question 
asked whether inhibiting ereg could prevent viral infection. address this
question, antisense oligonucleiotides (asodns) used down-regulate ereg
expression hepg2.2.15 cells. able show hbv propagation in
hepg2.2.15 cell culture reduced dose-dependent manner ereg
inhibition. addition, found treatment asodns affect
hepg2.2.15 cell viability. probe role ereg hbv replication, the
interaction ereg hbsag also verified using co-immunoprecipitation
and gst pull-down assays. observed ereg contribute hbsag binding
to hepg2 cells. summary, study demonstrates ereg essential for
hbv replication also provides evidence potential role ereg in
hbsag binding.
