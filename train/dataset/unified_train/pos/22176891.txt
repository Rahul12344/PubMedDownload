background: process aiv infect hosts, ns1 protein act 
hosts, change corresponding signal pathways, promote translation virus
proteins result virus replication.
results: study, found parp domain glu-rich region parp10
interacted ns1, presence ns1 could induce parp10 migrate from
cytoplasm nucleus. ns1 high expression could reduce endogenous parp10
expression. cell cycle analysis showed inhibited parp10 expression, ns1
could induce cell arrest g2-m stage, percentage cells g2-m stage
rise previous 10%-45%, consistent cell proliferation result.
plague forming unit measurement showed inhibited parp10 expression could
help virus replication.
conclusions: word, results showed ns1 acts host cells parp10
plays regulating role virus replication.
