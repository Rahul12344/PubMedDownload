background: human eed protein, member superfamily polycomb group 
proteins, involved multiple cellular protein complexes. c-terminal
domain, common four eed isoforms, contains seven repeats a
canonical wd-40 motif. eed interactor three hiv-1 proteins, matrix (ma),
integrase (in) nef. antiviral activity found associated
with isoforms eed3 eed4 late stage hiv-1 replication, due a
negative effect virus assembly genomic rna packaging. aim the
present study determine regions eed c-terminal core domain
which accessible available protein interactions, using
three-dimensional (3d) protein homology modelling wd-40 protein known
structure, epitope mapping anti-eed antibodies.
results: data suggested c-terminal domain eed folded a
seven-bladed beta-propeller protein. completion work,
crystallographic data eed became available co-crystals eed
c-terminal core n-terminal domain cellular partner ezh2. our
3d-model good congruence refined structural model determined from
crystallographic data, except unique alpha-helix fourth beta-blade. 
more importantly, position flexible loops accessible beta-strands on
the beta-propeller consistent mapping immunogenic epitopes and
sites interaction hiv-1 in. certain immunoreactive regions were
found overlap ezh2, binding sites, confirming their
accessibility reactivity surface eed. crystal structure eed
showed two discrete regions interaction not
overlap other, ezh2 binding pocket, contiguous,
and formed continuous binding groove running along lateral face the
beta-propeller.
conclusion: identification antibody-, ma-, in- ezh2-binding sites the
surface eed isoform 3 provided global picture immunogenic and
protein-protein interacting regions eed c-terminal domain, organized 
seven-bladed beta-propeller protein. mapping hiv-1 binding sites
on 3d-model eed core predicted eed-bound ligands would be
in close vicinity surface beta-propeller, occurrence
of ternary complex ma-eed-in would possible.
