the small genome polyomaviruses encodes limited number proteins 
highly dependent interactions host cell proteins efficient viral
replication. sv40 large antigen (lt) contains several discrete functional
domains including lxcxe rb-binding motif, dna binding helicase
domains contribute viral life cycle. addition, lt c-terminal
region contains host range adenovirus helper functions required lytic
