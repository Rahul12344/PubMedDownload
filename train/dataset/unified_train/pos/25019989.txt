dengue virus (denv) positive-strand rna virus flavivirus family 
4 different serotypes. clinical manifestations denv infection include dengue
fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome. following denv
infection, apoptosis hepatic cells observed vitro vivo.
however, molecular mechanisms revealing viral components affect cellular 
apoptosis remain unclear. present study, role death
domain-associated protein 6 (daxx) denv-mediated apoptosis characterized
by rna interference overexpression studies, anti-apoptotic function
of daxx denv infection identified. furthermore, viral component,
denv capsid protein (denv c), interacted daxx disrupt interaction between
daxx nf-κb. liberated nf-κb activated promoter cd137, a
member tnf family, previously shown induce apoptosis denv
infection. summary, denv c disrupts daxx nf-κb interaction induce
cd137-mediated apoptosis denv infection.
