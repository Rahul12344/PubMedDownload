the cellular chaperone hsp90 shown associate reverse
transcriptase (rt) duck hepatitis b virus required rt
functions. however, molecular basis specific interaction 
rt hsp90 remains unknown. comparison protein compositional properties
suggests rt highly related protein kinase c-raf, which
interacts hsp90 via cochaperone p50 (cdc37). tested whether rt,
like c-raf, specifically recognized p50. immunoprecipitation pull-down 
assays showed p50 p50deltac, p50 mutant defective hsp90 binding,
could interact specifically rt vitro vivo, indicating
that p50 bind rt independently hsp90. furthermore, purified p50 and
p50deltac interacted directly purified rt. importance p50-rt
interaction rt functions underscored 1) inhibition protein-primed
initiation reverse transcription p50deltac vitro 2) stimulation of
viral dna replication rna packaging p50 inhibition p50deltac 
in transfected cells. results suggest p50 function cellular
cofactor hepadnavirus rt mediating interaction rt 
hsp90.
