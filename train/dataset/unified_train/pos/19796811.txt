placentae newborns congenital human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infection
often display shallow implantation, chronic villitis disruptions the
syncytiotrophoblast. little known hcmv infection induces
inflammation placenta loss trophoblast. propose the
inflammation initiated innate defense responses mature
syncytiotrophoblast (st) virus. previously shown ultraviolet
irradiation-inactivated (uv-) hcmv interacts toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) 
primary placental cytotrophoblasts (ct) differentiated st-like cells thereby
stimulating release tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnfalpha) inducing
apoptosis neighboring cells (chan et al, j. pathol. 210: 111, 2006). now
determine whether known co-factors interaction hcmv tlr2 (tlr1 
cd14) bind uv-hcmv stimulate expression tnfalpha apoptosis in
st-like cells ct. show ct fail express detectable tlr1
and express much less cd14 st st express cd14 tlr1 
vivo cultured cells. interaction uv-hcmv hcmv cd14 
surface st-like cells increases tnfalpha expression induces apoptosis in
the population. antibody cd14 also inhibits infectious hcmv induction hcmv 
immediate early (hcmv ie) expressing st-like cells. conclude primary
villous ct express low levels cd14 tlr1 st strongly expresses 
cd14 acts upstream tlr2 collect even transcriptionally inactive virus
particles stimulate tnfalpha expression villous trophoblast damage.
