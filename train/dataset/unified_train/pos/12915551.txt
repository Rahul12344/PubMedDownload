we shown previously interferon regulatory factor 7 (irf7), a
multifunctional protein intimately involved latent epstein-barr virus (ebv)
infection, induced well activated ebv latent membrane protein 1
(lmp1), principal ebv oncoprotein. since lmp1 promoter (lmp1p) contains
an interferon-stimulated response element (isre), hypothesized irf7 might
be able regulate lmp1 expression thus participate regulatory circuit 
between two genes. study, irf7 shown first activate lmp1p in
transient transfection assays. compared ebv nuclear antigen 2 (ebna2), the
most potent viral transactivator lmp1p, irf7 lesser effect
(approximately 10% ebna2) induction lmp1p. study irf7 deletion
mutants showed irf7 functional domains similar effects beta
interferon (ifn-beta) lmp1 promoters bjab 293 cells, study with
irf7 phosphomimetic mutants showed irf7 phosphorylation may involved in
the activation two promoters. further, isre lmp1p responds to
irf7 induction irf7 binds element. ebv-positive cell line
p3hr1, lacks complete ebna2 ebv-encoded leader protein genes and
hence expresses low-level lmp1, irf7 alone notably increase endogenous
lmp1 mrna protein levels. results indicate lmp1 regulated by
this host cell gene addition viral factor, ebna2, may help to
explain lmp1 expressed type ii latency absence ebna2.
moreover, irf7 regulate viral gene addition host cellular gene such
as ifn-beta gene. together previous data lmp1 induce irf7
expression facilitate irf7 phosphorylation nuclear translocation, these
results suggest positive regulatory circuit irf7 lmp1.
