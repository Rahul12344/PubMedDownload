hiv-1 reverse transcriptase discriminates poorly dutp dttp, and
accordingly, viral dna products become heavily uracilated viruses infect
host cells contain high ratios dutp:dttp. uracilation invading
retroviral dna thought innate immunity barrier retroviral
infection, mechanistic features immune pathway cellular
fate uracilated retroviral dna products known. developed a
model system cellular dutp:dttp ratio pharmacologically
increased favor dutp incorporation, allowing dissection innate
immunity pathway. virus-infected cells contained elevated dutp levels,
reverse transcription found proceed unperturbed, integration viral
protein expression largely blocked. furthermore, successfully integrated
proviruses lacked detectable uracil, suggesting nonuracilated viral dna
products integration competent. integration uracilated proviruses was
restored using isogenic cell line detectable human uracil dna
glycosylase (hung2) activity, establishing hung2 host restriction
factor cells contain high dutp. biochemical studies primary cells
established immune pathway operative cd4+ cells, because
these cells high dutpase activity (low dutp), modest levels hung
activity. although monocyte-derived macrophages high dutp levels, these
cells low hung activity, may diminish effectiveness this
restriction pathway. findings establish essential elements this
pathway reconcile diverse observations literature.
