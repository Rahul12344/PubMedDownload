the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (hiv-1) tat protein previously reported to
compete association pa28 regulator alpha rings 20s
proteasome inhibit peptidase activity. however, distinct
interaction sites within proteasome complex remained determined. here
we show hiv-1 tat binds alpha4 alpha7, six beta subunits the
constitutive 20s proteasome interferon-gamma-inducible subunits beta2i
and beta5i. tat-proteasome interaction also demonstrated vivo and
leads inhibition proteasomal activity. indicates tat modulate
or interfere cellular proteasome function specific interaction with
distinct proteasomal subunits.
