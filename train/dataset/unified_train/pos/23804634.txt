most viruses possess strategies circumvent host immune responses. measles 
virus (mv) nonstructural c protein suppresses interferon response, thereby
allowing efficient viral growth, detailed mechanism unknown. 
identified shc src homology 2 domain-binding protein 1 (shcbp1) one the
host proteins interacting c protein. knockdown shcbp1 using a
short-hairpin rna greatly reduced mv growth. shcbp1 found required 
viral rna synthesis minigenome assay bind mv phosphoprotein,
a subunit viral rna polymerase. stretch 12 amino acid residues the
c protein sufficient shcbp1 binding, peptide containing 12
residues could suppress mv rna synthesis, like full-length c protein. the
central region shcbp1 found bind c protein, well the
phosphoprotein, two viral proteins compete shcbp1 binding.
our results indicate c protein modulates mv rna polymerase activity by
binding host protein shcbp1. shcbp1 may exploited target of
antiviral compounds.
