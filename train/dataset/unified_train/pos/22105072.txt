identification characterization virus-host interactions important
steps toward better understanding molecular mechanisms responsible for
disease progression pathogenesis. date, cellular factors involved
in life cycle flaviviruses, important human pathogens, been
described. study, demonstrate crucial role class ii arf proteins
(arf4 arf5) dengue flavivirus life cycle. show simultaneous
depletion arf4 arf5 blocks recombinant subviral particle secretion all
four dengue serotypes. immunostaining analysis suggests class ii arf
proteins required early pre-golgi step dengue virus secretion.
using horseradish peroxidase protein fused signal peptide, show that
class ii arfs act specifically dengue virus secretion without altering the
secretion proteins constitutive secretory pathway.
co-immunoprecipitation data demonstrate dengue prm glycoprotein
interacts class ii arf proteins c-terminal vxpx motif.
finally, experiments performed replication-competent dengue yellow fever
viruses demonstrate depletion class ii arfs inhibits virus secretion,
thus confirming implication virus life cycle, although data obtained
with west nile virus pointed differences virus-host interactions among
flaviviruses. findings shed new light molecular mechanism used dengue
viruses late stages life cycle demonstrate novel function
for class ii arf proteins.
