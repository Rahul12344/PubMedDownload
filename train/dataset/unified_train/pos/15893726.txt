we recently reported hepatitis c virus (hcv) rna replication requires one or
more geranylgeranylated host proteins. using combination [(3)h]mevalonate
labeling, coimmunoprecipitation, bioinformatic search, identified a
geranylgeranylated host protein required hcv rna replication. protein,
fbl2, contains f box domain caax motif (cvil). forms stable
immunoprecipitable complex hcv nonstructural protein 5a (ns5a). the
association fbl2 ns5a requires caax motif fbl2, f box.
deletion f box created dominant-negative protein inhibited
replication hcv rna overexpressed huh7-k2040 cells; inhibition
was overcome coexpression ns5a. sirna-mediated knockdown fbl2 mrna by
70% huh7-hp cells reduced hcv rna 65%; reduction overcome by
expression cdna encoding wobble mutant fbl2. current data indicate 
that geranylgeranylated fbl2 binds ns5a reaction crucial hcv rna
replication.
