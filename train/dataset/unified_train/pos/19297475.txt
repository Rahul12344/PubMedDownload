the human adenovirus e4orf6 e1b55k proteins promote viral replication by
targeting several cellular proteins degradation. e4orf6 product 
shown group others form e3 ubiquitin ligase complex that
contains elongins b c cullin family member cul5. e1b55k associates with
this complex, believed function primarily introduce bound
substrates degradation via proteasomes. addition p53, first known
substrate, e4orf6/e1b 55-kda complex (e4orf6/e1b55k) shown promote the
degradation mre11 dna ligase iv; however, additional substrates are
believed exist. notion strengthened fact none these
substrates seems likely associated additional functions shown be
mediated e4orf6-associated e3 ubiquitin ligase complex, including export
of late viral mrnas blockage export bulk cellular mrnas the
nucleus. attempt identify new e4orf6/e1b55k substrates, undertook a
proteomic screen using human p53-null, non-small-cell lung carcinoma h1299 cells 
expressing either e4orf6 protein alone combination e1b55k through
infection appropriate adenovirus vectors. one cellular protein appeared
to degraded e1b55k combination e4orf6 protein species 
molecular mass approximately 130 kda identified integrin alpha3
subunit (i.e., late activation antigen 3 alpha subunit). preliminary
analyses suggested degradation alpha3 may play role promoting
release spread progeny virions.
