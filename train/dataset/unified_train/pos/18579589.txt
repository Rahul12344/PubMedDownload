the papillomavirus life cycle intimately coupled differentiation state 
of infected epithelium. since papillomaviruses lack rate-limiting
enzymes required genome synthesis, need uncouple keratinocyte
differentiation cell cycle arrest maintain reestablish a
replication-competent state within terminally differentiated keratinocytes. the
human papillomavirus (hpv) e7 protein appears major determinant 
activity induces aberrant s-phase entry inactivation the
retinoblastoma tumor suppressor related pocket proteins. addition, e7 
abrogate p21 p27. together, leads activation e2f1 e2f5,
enhanced expression e2f-responsive genes, increased cdk2 activity. e2f6 is
a prb-independent, noncanonical member e2f transcription factor family
that acts transcriptional repressor. e2f6 expression activated phase
through e2f-dependent mechanism thus may provide negative-feedback
mechanism slows s-phase progression and/or exit response the
activation e2f transcription factors. here, show low- and
high-risk hpv e7 proteins, well simian virus 40 antigen adenovirus
e1a, associate inactivate transcriptional repression activity of
e2f6, thereby subverting critical cellular defense mechanism. may result
in extended s-phase competence hpv-infected cells. e2f6 component 
polycomb group complexes, bind silenced chromatin critical for
the maintenance cell fate. show e7-expressing cells show decreased
staining e2f6/polycomb complexes least part dependent 
on association e2f6.
