dengue virus (denv), emerging mosquito-transmitted pathogen capable causing
severe disease humans, interacts host cell factors create more
favorable environment replication. however, interactions denv and
human proteins reported date. identify denv-human protein
interactions, used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays screen 10
denv proteins human liver activation domain library. 45
dna-binding domain clones containing either full-length viral genes partially 
overlapping gene fragments, identified 139 interactions denv human
proteins, vast majority novel. interactions involved 105
human proteins, including six previously implicated denv infection 45
linked replication viruses. human proteins functions related
to complement coagulation cascade, centrosome, cytoskeleton
were enriched among denv interaction partners. determine cellular
proteins required denv infection, used small interfering rnas to
inhibit expression. six 12 proteins targeted (calr, ddx3x, erc1, golga2,
trip11, ube2i) caused significant decrease replication denv
replicon. showed calreticulin colocalized viral dsrna and
with viral ns3 ns5 proteins denv-infected cells, consistent a
direct role calreticulin denv replication. human proteins interacted 
with denv significantly higher average degree betweenness expected
by chance, provides additional support hypothesis viruses
preferentially target cellular proteins occupy central position human
protein interaction network. study provides valuable starting point for
additional investigations roles human proteins denv infection.
