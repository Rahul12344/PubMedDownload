cervical cancer still one leading causes cancer deaths women
worldwide, especially developing countries. major metabolic
character cancer cells consume large quantities glucose derive 
energy glycolysis even presence adequate oxygen, called
warburg effect exaggerated hypoxia. high risk subtype hpv16
early oncoprotein e6 contributes host cell immortalization transformation
through interacting number cellular factors. hypoxia-inducible factor
1α (hif-1α), ubiquitously expressed transcriptional regulator involved in
induction numerous genes associated angiogenesis tumor growth, is
highly increased hpv e6. hif-1α best-known target von
hippel-lindau tumor suppressor (vhl) e3 ligase degradation. the
present work, found hpv16 e6 promotes hypoxia induced warburg effect
through hindering association hif-1α vhl. disassociation
attenuates vhl-mediated hif-1α ubiquitination causes hif-1α accumulation.
these results suggest oncoprotein e6 plays major role regulation of
warburg effect valuable therapeutic target hpv-related cancer.
