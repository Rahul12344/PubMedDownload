human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1) htlv-2 associated with
adult t-cell leukemia, distinct pathogenicity two closely
related viruses thought stem distinct biological functions 
respective transforming proteins, htlv-1 tax1 htlv-2 tax2. study, 
demonstrate tax1 tax2 interacts nf-kappab2/p100 activates
it inducing cleavage p100 active transcription factor p52.
using rna interference methods, show nf-kappab2/p100 required 
for transformation induced tax1, determined ability convert a
t-cell line (ctll-2) interleukin-2 (il-2)-dependent -independent growth. 
while tax2 shows reduced transforming activity relative tax1, tax2 fused
with pdz domain binding motif (pbm) present tax1 shows transforming
activity equivalent tax1 ctll-2 cells expressing inducer p52 
processing. results reveal activation nf-kappab2/p100 plays a
crucial role tax1-mediated transformation cells that
nf-kappab2/p100 activation pbm function responsible the
augmented transforming activity tax1 relative tax2, thus suggesting that
these tax1-specific functions play crucial roles htlv-1 leukemogenesis.
