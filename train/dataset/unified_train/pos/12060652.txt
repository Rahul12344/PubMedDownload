hepatitis virus (hdv) encodes two proteins, 24-kda small delta antigen
(s-hdag) 27-kda large delta antigen (l-hdag) single open reading
frame. identified nuclear phosphoproteins. moreover, the
phosphorylated form s-hdag shown important hdv replication.
however, kinase responsible s-hdag phosphorylation remains unknown.
therefore, employed in-gel kinase assay search candidate kinases and
indeed identified kinase molecular mass 68 kda. much evidence
demonstrated kinase double-stranded rna-activated kinase, pkr. the
immunoprecipitated endogenous pkr sufficient catalyze s-hdag
phosphorylation, kinase activity disappeared pkr-depleted cell
lysate. s-hdag pkr could co-immunoprecipitated together, of
them co-located nucleolus. lc/ms/ms analysis revealed serine 
177, serine 180, threonine 182 s-hdag phosphorylated pkr vitro.
this result consistent previous phosphoamino acid analysis indicating
that serine threonine phosphorylation targets s-hdag. furthermore,
serine 177 also shown predominant phosphorylation site s-hdag
purified cell line. dominant negative pkr-transfected cells, the
level phosphorylated s-hdag suppressed, replication hdv was
enhanced. human immunodeficiency virus type 1 trans-activating protein
(tat), s-hdag another viral protein phosphorylated pkr may regulates
hdv replication viral response interferon therapy.
