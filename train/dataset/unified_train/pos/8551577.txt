retroviral replication requires portion primary transcripts
generated proviral dna spliced serve mrna envelope protein 
and rous sarcoma virus src mrna. however, substantial amount of
full-length rna must maintained unspliced form, unspliced rna
serves mrna structural proteins virion-associated enzymatic
proteins genomic rna progeny virions. extent viral rna splicing
must finely controlled, since narrow range ratio unspliced
rna spliced rna tolerated optimal replication. number cis-acting
sequences within rna rous sarcoma virus play role preserving large 
pool unspliced rna. one sequence, negative regulator splicing
(nrs), interest blocks splicing located near of
the splice junctions. better understand novel element blocks splicing
at distance, set identify host cell factors interact
specifically inhibitory sequence. study, proteins nuclear 
extracts molecular masses 26, 36, 44, 55 kda shown uv
cross-linking assays bind nrs preferentially. one them, p55, also
detected specific complex sr protein electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. p55 biochemical properties consistent sr protein
splicing factors, some, all, total sr proteins purified from
hela cells cross-link specifically nrs. strongest cross-linking sr
protein srp30a/b, composed splicing factors sf2/asf sc35. 
the nrs specifically binds bacterially expressed sf2/asf, whereas nonfunctional
mutants not. data indicating 36-kda protein cross-links in
nuclear extracts sf2/asf presented. data indicate factors
normally required rna splicing may exploited retroviruses block
splicing.
