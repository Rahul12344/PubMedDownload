s100a8, s100a9, s100a12, collectively known myeloid-related proteins
(mrps), highly expressed myeloid cell lineage found the
extracellular milieu infections inflammatory conditions. recent data
showed high levels mrps serum hiv type 1 (hiv-1)-infected patients
which correlated disease progression low cd4(+) counts. therefore, we
set investigate effect mrps hiv-1 replication. observed 4- 
to 5-fold induction virus production j1.1, human lymphoid cell line
latently infected hiv-1, following treatment mrps. using
luciferase-based reporter gene assays, demonstrated mrps induce dose-
and time-dependent activation hiv-1 long terminal repeat promoter region
that could blocked specific anti-mrp polyclonal abs physical
denaturation proteins. mrp-mediated induction acting the
hiv-1 enhancer sequence dependent upon nf-kappab activity. latter
results also confirmed emsa experiments conducted jurkat cells and
freshly isolated pbmcs. conclusion, demonstrate mrps induce hiv-1
transcriptional activity viral replication infected cd4(+) t-lymphocytes
at concentrations similar found serum hiv-1-infected patients.
