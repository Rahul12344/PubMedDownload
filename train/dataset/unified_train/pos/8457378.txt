five cdna clones taxreb proteins bind tax-responsive enhancer
element human t-cell leukemia virus type (htlv-i) isolated a
jurkat cell cdna library. beta-galactosidase fusion proteins three of
these clones specifically recognized domain c within enhancer. one the
three cdnas, encoding taxreb107, contained open reading frame 288 amino
acid residues. rna blot analysis showed level mrna taxreb107
increased transiently jurkat cells treatment tpa. immunoblot analysis 
showed polyclonal antibody taxreb107 specifically recognized 34-kd
protein jurkat cells. taxreb107 may participate tax-mediated
trans-activation transcription.
