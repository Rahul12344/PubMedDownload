eosinophils, stimulated, release variety agents toxic to
ingested extracellular targets. among systems one consists of
eosinophil peroxidase (epo), h2o2, halide. report phorbol
myristate acetate (pma)-stimulated human eosinophils virucidal hiv-1 
chloride-containing medium. eosinophil concentration decreased a
level virucidal effect incomplete, addition bromide or
iodide restored complete virucidal activity. virucidal effect eosinophils,
pma, bromide conditions inhibited peroxidase inhibitor 
azide catalase, heated catalase superoxide dismutase, implicating 
the epo-h2o2-halide system. purified epo combined h2o2 a
chloride-containing medium virucidal hiv-1. epo concentration is
suboptimal, virucidal activity increased bromide, iodide, and, this
instance, thiocyanate virucidal activity bromide-supplemented
system inhibited azide catalase. findings, together the
demonstration eosinophils express cd4 surface and, some
circumstances, productively infected hiv-1, raise possibility
that biological oxidants formed eosinophils influence pathogenesis 
hiv-1 infection toxicity eosinophil-associated extracellular
virus.
