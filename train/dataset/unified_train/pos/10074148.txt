the tumor-associated latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1) gene epstein-barr
virus (ebv) genome activated ebv-encoded proteins cellular factors that
are part general signal transduction pathways. previously demonstrated, the
proximal region lmp1 promoter regulatory sequence (lrs) contains a
negative cis element major role ebna2-mediated regulation lmp1 gene 
expression b cells. here, show silencing activity overlaps a
transcriptional enhancer lrs sequence contains e-box-homologous
motif. mutation putative repressor binding site relieved repression
both promoter-proximal context complete lrs context, indicating a
functional role repressor. gel retardation assays showed members of
the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor family, including max, mad1, usf,
e12, e47, corepressor msin3a bound e-box-containing sequence. 
the enhancer activity correlated binding usf. moreover, activity 
of lmp1 promoter reporter constructs upregulated overexpression 
usf1 usf2a, transactivation inhibited concurrent
expression max mad1. suggests max-mad1-mediated anchorage a
multiprotein complex including msin3a histone deacetylases e-box site 
constitutes basis repression. removal acetyl moieties from
histones h3 h4 result chromatin structure inaccessible to
transcription factors. accordingly, inhibition deacetylase activity with
trichostatin induced expression endogenous lmp1 gene ebv-transformed 
cells.
