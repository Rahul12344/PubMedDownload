the viral factor e7 plays key role well-established association 
"high-risk" human papillomavirus (hpv) infection development of
epithelial malignant tumors, uterine cervix ano-genital cancer. delve
into molecular mechanisms hpv-mediated cell transformation, searched
for novel potential cellular targets hpv-16 e7 oncoprotein, means of
the yeast two-hybrid technique, identifying protein-protein interaction between
hpv-16 e7 pro-apoptotic cellular factor siva-1. using co-precipitation
assays "pepsets" technique, confirmed physical interaction and
mapped accurately, proteins, amino acid residues involved.
additionally, found hpv-16 e7 competed vitro binding the
bcl-x(l) anti-apoptotic factor siva-1, interaction major
inference uv radiation-induced apoptosis. hacat immortalized human
keratinocytes, forced hpv-16 e7 expression retroviral infection caused siva-1 
transcript up-regulation, detected cdna macroarray hybridization real-time
quantitative pcr, paralleled increased amount protein. confirming the
anti-apoptotic role hpv-16 e7 hacat cellular model, evaluated by
nuclear morphology, also found siva-1 expression produced significant
increase apoptotic rate uv radiation-exposed hacat cells, this
effect resulted explicitly counteracted hpv-16 e7. apoptosis key
physiological process elimination irreversibly injured cells, the
anti-apoptotic role hpv-16 e7, performed least interference with
siva-1, considered additional mechanism survival damaged,
potentially transforming, cell clones.
