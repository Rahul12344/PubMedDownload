hepatitis b virus (hbv) core promoter contains binding site nuclear
receptors. natural double mutation binding site, changes
nucleotide (nt) 1765 nt 1767 g a, selectively abolishes
the binding several nuclear receptors without affecting hnf4. this
double mutation also creates binding site transcription factor hnf1 and
changes two amino acids overlapping x protein sequence. study, 
have examined roles hnf1, hnf4, x protein regulation the
core promoter activities huh7 hepatoma cells. results indicate hnf4
could stimulate expression precore rna core rna core 
promoter wild-type (wt) hbv double mutant, although its
effect former prominent. contrast, hnf1, affect 
the wt core promoter, suppressed precore rna expression double mutant.
further analysis using hbv genomic constructs, without ability to
express x protein, indicates x protein affect hnf4
activity core promoter affected hnf1 activity core promoter
of double mutant. thus, results indicate phenotypic
differences hbv wt double-mutant core promoters least partially due
to differential activities hnf1, hnf4, x protein two
promoters.
