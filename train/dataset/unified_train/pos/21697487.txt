phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase iii alpha (pi4ka) essential cofactor of
hepatitis c virus (hcv) replication. initiated study determine whether
hcv directly engages pi4ka establish replication. pi4ka kinase activity
was found absolutely required hcv replication using small interfering
rna transcomplementation assay. moreover, hcv infection subgenomic hcv
replicons produced dramatic increase phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (pi4p)
accumulation throughout cytoplasm, partially colocalized the
endoplasmic reticulum. contrast, majority pi4p accumulated golgi
bodies uninfected cells. increase pi4p observed infection
with uv-inactivated hcv reflect changes pi4ka protein rna
abundance. analysis u2os cell lines inducible expression hcv
polyprotein individual viral proteins, viral polyprotein expression resulted
in enhanced cytoplasmic pi4p production. increased pi4p accumulation following
hcv protein expression precluded silencing expression pi4ka, but
not related pi4kb. silencing pi4ka also resulted aberrant agglomeration of
viral replicase proteins, including ns5a, ns5b, ns3. ns5a alone, not
other viral proteins, stimulated pi4p production vivo enhanced pi4ka
kinase activity vitro. lastly, pi4ka coimmunoprecipitated ns5a from
infected huh-7.5 cells dually transfected 293t cells. sum, these
results suggest hcv ns5a modulation pi4ka-dependent pi4p production
influences replication complex formation.
