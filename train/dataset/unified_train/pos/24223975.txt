in classical human leukocyte antigen (hla) class antigen processing and
presentation pathway, antigenic peptides generated viral proteins by
multiple proteolytic cleavages proteasome (and cases other
cytosolic proteases) transported endoplasmic reticulum (er) lumen
where exposed aminopeptidase activity. human cells, two different 
er-resident enzymes, erap1 erap2, trim n-terminally extended residues
of peptide precursors. study, possible cooperative effect of
generating five naturally processed hla-b27 ligands proteases was
analyzed. identified differences products obtained increased
detection natural hla-b27 ligands comparing double versus single enzyme
digestions mass spectrometry analysis. vitro data suggest each
enzyme use degradation products substrate new
n-terminal trimming, indicating concerted aminoproteolytic activity erap 1 and
erap2.
