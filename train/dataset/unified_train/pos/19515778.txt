the precise mechanisms regulating hepatitis c virus (hcv) entry hepatic
cells remain unknown. however, several cell surface proteins identified
as entry factors virus. molecules, claudin-1, tight junction 
(tj) component, considered coreceptor required hcv entry. recently, we
have demonstrated hcv envelope glycoproteins (hcvgp) promote structural 
functional tj alterations. additionally, shown intracellular
interaction viral e2 glycoprotein occludin, another tj-associated
protein, could cause mislocalization tj proteins. herein we
demonstrated, using cell culture-derived hcv particles (hcvcc), that
interference occludin expression markedly reduced hcv infection. furthermore, 
our results hcv pseudotyped particles indicated occludin, other
tj-associated proteins, junctional adhesion molecule zonula
occludens protein 1, required hcv entry. using hcvcc, demonstrated
that occludin play essential role initial attachment hcv 
target cells. surface protein labeling experiments showed expression
levels cell surface localization hcv (co)receptors cd81, scavenger
receptor class b type i, claudin-1 affected upon occludin knockdown.
in addition, immunofluorescence confocal analysis showed occludin
interference affect subcellular distribution hcv (co)receptors
analyzed. however, hcvgp fusion-associated events altered occludin
silencing. summary, propose occludin plays essential role hcv
infection probably affects late entry events. observation may provide
new insights hcv infection related pathogenesis.
