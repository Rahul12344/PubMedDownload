ubiquitination human t-cell leukemia virus 1 tax oncoprotein provides an
important regulatory mechanism promotes tax-mediated activation of
nf-kappab. however, type polyubiquitin chain linkages host factors
that required tax ubiquitination identified. here, we
demonstrate tax polyubiquitin chains composed predominantly lysine
63-linked chains. furthermore, ubiquitination tax critically dependent 
on e2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubc13. tax interacts ubc13, small
interfering rna-mediated knockdown ubc13 expression abrogates tax
ubiquitination activation nf-kappab. mouse fibroblasts lacking ubc13
exhibit impaired tax activation nf-kappab despite normal tumor necrosis
factor- interleukin-1-mediated nf-kappab activation. finally, interaction
of tax nemo disrupted absence tax ubiquitination ubc13
expression, suggesting tax ubiquitination critical nemo binding.
collectively, results reveal ubc13 essential tax ubiquitination, 
its interaction nemo, tax-mediated nf-kappab activation.
