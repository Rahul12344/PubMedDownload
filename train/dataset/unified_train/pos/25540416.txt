epstein-barr virus (ebv) conversion b-lymphocytes lymphoblastoid cell lines
(lcls) requires four ebv nuclear antigen (ebna) oncoproteins: ebna2, ebnalp,
ebna3a, ebna3c. ebna2 ebnalp associate ebv cell enhancers,
up-regulate ebna promoter, myc, ebv latent infection membrane proteins
(lmps), up-regulate bcl2 protect ebv-infected b-cells myc
proliferation-induced cell death. lcl proliferation induces p16(ink4a) and
p14(arf)-mediated cell senescence. ebna3a ebna3c jointly suppress p16(ink4a) 
and p14(arf), enabling continuous cell proliferation. analyses ebna3a
human genome-wide chip-seq landscape revealed 37% 10,000 ebna3a sites at
strong enhancers; 28% weak enhancers; 4.4% active promoters;
and 6.9% weak poised promoters. ebna3a colocalized batf-irf4,
ets-irf4, runx3, b-cell transcription factors (tfs). ebna3a sites
clustered seven unique groups, differing b-cell tfs epigenetic
marks. ebna3a coincidence batf-irf4 runx3 associated stronger
ebna3a chip-seq signals. ebna3a myc, cdkn2a/b, ccnd2, cxcl9/10, bcl2, 
together runx3, batf, irf4, spi1. chip-re-chip revealed complexes of
ebna3a dna batf. data strongly support model ebna3a is
tethered dna batf-containing protein complexes enable continuous 
cell proliferation.
