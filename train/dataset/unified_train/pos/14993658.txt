the hepatitis c virus (hcv) non-structural ns5a protein shown to
associate variety cellular signalling proteins. particular interest 
is observation highly conserved c-terminal polyproline motif ns5a
was able interact src-homology 3 (sh3) domains adaptor protein
grb2. previously shown specific polyproline motifs can
interact range sh3 domains, investigated whether ns5a capable of
interacting sh3 domain-containing proteins. show ns5a
interacts sh3 domains members src family tyrosine kinases: 
a combination vitro binding assays co-immunoprecipitation experiments
revealed interaction ns5a hck, lck, lyn fyn, interestingly
not src itself. mutational analysis confirmed polyproline motif
responsible binding grb2 also bound sh3 domains hck, lck, lyn
and fyn. furthermore, previously unidentified polyproline motif, adjacent to
the first motif, also able mediate binding sh3 domain lyn. using
transient transfections huh-7 cells harbouring persistently replicating
subgenomic hcv replicon demonstrate ns5a bound native src-family
kinases vivo differentially modulated kinase activity, inhibiting hck, lck
and lyn activating fyn. lastly, show signalling pathways controlled
by src-family kinases modulated replicon cells. conclude the
interactions ns5a src-family kinases physiologically relevant and
may play role either virus replication pathogenesis.
