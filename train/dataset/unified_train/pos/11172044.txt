the infected cell protein no. 0 (icp0) herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) a
promiscuous transactivator shown enhance expression gene introduced
into cells infection transfection. molecular level, icp0 775-aa
ring finger protein localized initially nucleus late infection in
the cytoplasm mediates degradation several proteins stabilization 
of others. none known functions molecular level account the
apparent activity icp0 transactivator. report icp0
functionally interacts cellular transcription factor bmal1, member 
basic helix-loop-helix per-arnt-sim (pas) super family transcriptional
regulators. specifically, sequences mapped exon ii icp0 interacted with
bmal1 yeast two-hybrid system reciprocal pull-down experiments in
vitro. moreover, enhancement transcription luciferase reporter
construct whose promoter contained multiple bmal1-binding sites icp0 bmal1
was significantly greater observed icp0 bmal1 alone. although the
level bmal1 present nuclei infected cells remained unchanged 3
and 8 h infection, level cytoplasmic bmal1 reduced 8 h 
infection. reduction cytoplasmic bmal1 significantly greater cells 
infected icp0-null mutant wild-type virus-infected cells,
suggesting icp0 mediates partial stabilization protein. results
indicate icp0 interacts physically functionally least one
cellular transcription-regulatory factor.
