the latent-to-lytic switch epstein-barr virus (ebv) mediated the
immediate early protein bzlf1 (z). however, cellular factors regulating 
process remain incompletely characterized. report, show the
b-cell-specific transcription factor pax5 helps promote viral latency b
cells blocking z function. although z previously shown directly
interact pax5 inhibit activity, effect pax5 z function has
not investigated. here, demonstrate pax5 inhibits z-mediated lytic
viral gene expression release infectious viral particles latently
infected epithelial cell lines. conversely, found shrna-mediated
knockdown endogenous pax5 burkitt lymphoma b-cell line leads viral
reactivation. furthermore, show pax5 reduces z activation early lytic 
viral promoters reporter gene assays inhibits z binding lytic viral
promoters vivo. confirm pax5 z directly interact show that
this interaction requires carboxy-terminal dna-binding/dimerization domain of
z amino-terminal dna-binding domain pax5. pax5 dna-binding mutant
(v26g/p80r) interacts z retains ability inhibit z function,
whereas pax5 mutant (Î´106-110) deficient interaction z does
not inhibit z-mediated lytic viral reactivation. since b-cell-specific
transcription factor oct-2 also directly interacts z inhibits its
function, results suggest ebv uses multiple redundant mechanisms to
establish maintain viral latency b cells.
