epstein-barr virus (ebv) establishes life-long latent infection humans. in
proliferating latently infected cells, ebv genomes persist multiple episomes
that undergo one dna replication event per cell cycle remain attached 
mitotic chromosomes. ebv nuclear antigen 1 (ebna-1) binding episome and
cellular genome essential ensure proper episome replication and
segregation. however, nature regulation ebna-1 interaction with
chromatin clearly elucidated. activity suggested to
involve ebna-1 binding dna, duplex rna, and/or proteins. ebna-1 binding
protein 2 (ebp2), nucleolar protein, proposed act docking
protein ebna-1 mitotic chromosomes. however, direct evidence
thus far ebp2 associated ebna-1 mitosis. combining video
microscopy förster resonance energy transfer (fret) microscopy, we
demonstrate first time ebna-1 ebp2 interact the
nucleoplasm, well nucleoli interphase. however, strong
contrast current proposed model, unable observe interaction
between ebna-1 ebp2 mitotic chromosomes. also performed yeast
double-hybrid screening, followed fret analysis, led us identify
hmgb2 (high-mobility group box 2), well-known chromatin component, new
partner ebna-1 chromatin interphase mitosis. although the
depletion hmgb2 partly altered ebna-1 association chromatin hela cells
during interphase mitosis, significantly impact maintenance of
ebv episomes raji cells.
