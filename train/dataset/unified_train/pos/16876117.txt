by use yeast two-hybrid system, hepatitis c virus (hcv) f protein was
found interact cellular protein named prefoldin 2. interaction 
confirmed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy well as
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. prefoldin 2 subunit hexameric
molecular chaperone complex, named prefoldin, delivers nascent actin and
tubulin proteins eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin facilitated folding. 
functional prefoldin spontaneously assembles six subunits (prefoldin
1-6). yeast three-hybrid system, found expression hcv f
protein impeded interaction prefoldin 1 2. performing
immunofluorescence experiment non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, was
shown expression hcv f protein resulted aberrant organization of
tubulin cytoskeleton. since hcv replication requires intact microtubule actin
polymerization, hcv f protein may serve modulator prevent high level of
hcv replication thus contributes viral persistence chronic hcv
infection.
