nuclear export important process regulates functions of
cellular factors also facilitates assembly viral nucleoprotein
complexes. chromosome region maintenance 1 (crm1) mediates transport 
proteins bearing classical leucine-rich nuclear export signal (nes) the
best-characterized nuclear export receptor. recently, several crm1-independent
nuclear export pathways also identified. nuclear export large
form hepatitis delta antigen (hdag-l), nucleocapsid protein hepatitis
delta virus (hdv), contains crm1-independent proline-rich nes, is
mediated host nes-interacting protein (nesi). mechanism nesi
protein mediating nuclear export still unknown. study, nesi was
characterized highly glycosylated membrane protein. interacted and
colocalized well nuclear envelope lamin a/c nucleoporins.
importantly, hdag-l could coimmunoprecipitated lamin a/c and
nucleoporins. addition, binding cargo hdag-l c terminus nesi 
was detected wild-type protein nuclear export-defective
hdag-l carrying p205a mutation [hdag-l(p205a)]. knockdown lamin a/c
effectively reduced nuclear export hdag-l assembly hdv. these
data indicate forming complexes lamin a/c nucleoporins, nesi
facilitates crm1-independent nuclear export hdag-l.
