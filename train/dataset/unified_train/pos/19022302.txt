hiv-encephalopathy (hive) common neurological disorder associated hiv-1
infection aids. activity hiv trans-activating protein tat is
thought contribute neuronal pathogenesis. tat proteins primary
virus isolates consist 101 amino acids, 72 86 amino acids forms of
tat commonly used vitro studies. although tat72 contains minimal
domain required viral replication, activities tat appear vary
according length, sub-cellular localization, cell type stage of
cellular differentiation. study, investigated stability of
intracellular tat101 proliferation differentiation neuronal cells
in culture. utilized rat neuronal progenitors model neuronal cell
proliferation differentiation, well rat primary cortical neurons a
model fully differentiated cells. results indicate that, upon
internalization, tat101 degraded rapidly proliferating cells 
cells either underwent neuronal differentiation fully
differentiated. intracellular degradation tat prevented calpain 1
inhibitor, alln, proliferating differentiated cells. inhibition of
calpain 1 calpastatin peptide also prevented tat cleavage. vitro calpain
digestion mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated sequence
of tat sensitive calpain cleavage located c-terminus viral 
protein, amino acids 68 69. moreover, cleavage tat101 calpain 1
increased neurotoxic effect viral protein presence calpain
inhibitor protected neuronal cells tat-mediated toxicity.
