ebna-3 one epstein-barr virus (ebv)-encoded nuclear antigens is
indispensable immunoblastic transformation sustained proliferation of
b-lymphocytes. molecular mechanisms responsible function ebna-3
are poorly understood. previously found ebna-3 interacts an
immunophilin-like protein xap2/ara9/aip, mammalian cells known to
interact latent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr). ahr a
ligand-inducible transcription factor mediates cellular responses to
environmental pollutants, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin (tcdd). in
this study, show ebna-3 interacts specifically ahr. stability of
this interaction determined activation state ahr association
with xap2. others demonstrated xap2 retains nonactivated ahr
in cell cytoplasm. however, presence tcdd, effect xap2 on
the intracellular localization ahr counter-acted ebna-3, resulting in
nuclear translocation ahr. addition, ebna-3 enhanced transactivation
function ligand-activated ahr cells, assessed reporter gene
assays. data suggested ebna-3 plays role facilitating the
ligand-dependent ahr activation process. following activation ahr, also
observed ebna-3 counteracted inhibitory effect tcdd growth 
ebv-carrying lymphoblasts. taken together, studies revealed novel
interaction ebv- ahr-dependent cellular pathways control cell
proliferation survival.
