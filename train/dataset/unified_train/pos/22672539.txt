background: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) nef-encoded protein plays
key functions almost stages viral life cycle, role in
translation largely unknown.
methods: determine effect nef translation used vitro
translation assay. detection nef/rps10 complexes presence 18s
rrna trnas complexes performed coimmunoprecipitation and
rt-pcr assay.
results: observed hiv-1 nef protein specifically impaired translation
in vitro. observed interaction nef rps10 coimmunoprecipitation 
assay. addition 18s rrna trnas present nef/rps10 complexes.
conclusions: results consistent model nef protein 
binding two components 40s small ribosomal subunit, rps10 18s rrna,
and lesser extent trnas, could lead decreased protein synthesis.
