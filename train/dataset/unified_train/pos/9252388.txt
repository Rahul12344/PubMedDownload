the hepatitis b virus x protein interacts basic-region, leucine zipper
protein (bzip) domain camp response element-binding protein increasing its
affinity camp response element site vitro transcriptional
efficacy vivo (williams, j. s., andrisani, o. m. (1995) proc. natl. acad. 
sci. u. s. a. 92, 3819-3823). examine px interactions bzip
transcription factors atf3, gadd153/chop10, icer iigamma, nf-il6. we
demonstrate direct interactions vitro px bzip proteins tested.
in contrast myod gal4(1-147) fail interact px. also demonstrate by
the mammalian two-hybrid assay direct interaction px camp response
element- binding protein, icer iigamma, atf3, nf-il6 hepatocytes. in
addition, px increases dna binding potential bzip proteins their
cognate dna-binding site vitro. transient transfections hepatocytes
(aml12 cell line), px increases transcriptional efficacy bzip
transcription factors. nf-il6-mediated transcriptional activation enhanced
3-fold px. interestingly, px augments repression mediated bzip
repressors atf3 icer iigamma, 6- 7-fold, respectively, demonstrating
for first time involvement px gene repression. conclude px 
is enhancer dna binding potential bzip transcription factors,
thereby increasing transactivation repression efficacy bzip-responsive 
genes.
