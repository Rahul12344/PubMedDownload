bovine herpesvirus 1 (bohv-1) important viral pathogen cattle. like
other members subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, bohv-1 establishes latency 
sensory neurons potential reactivate latency. dexamethasone
(dex) treatment latently infected calves rabbits consistently leads to
reactivation latency. bohv-1 transcript encoding infected cell
protein 0 (bicp0) consistently detected reactivation latency, in
part bicp0 early promoter activated dex. dex-induced
reactivation latency, cyclin expression stimulated infected sensory
neurons. cyclin-dependent kinase activity phosphorylates rb (retinoblastoma tumor
suppressor gene product) family proteins consequently releases e2f family
of transcription factors, suggesting e2f family members stimulate productive
infection and/or reactivation latency. study, provide evidence
that repression e2f1 specific small interfering rna (sirna) reduced
productive infection approximately 5-fold. e2f1 e2f2 stimulated bicp0 early
promoter activity least 100-fold transient transfection assays. two
e2f-responsive regions (err) identified within early promoter, one 
adjacent tata box (err1) one approximately 600 bp upstream the
tata box (err2). mobility shift assays suggested e2f interacts err1 and
err2. e2f1 protein levels increased late times infection, which
correlated enhanced binding consensus e2f binding site, err1, err2. 
collectively, studies suggest e2f1 stimulates productive infection and
bicp0 early promoter activity, part e2f family members interact with
err1 err2.
