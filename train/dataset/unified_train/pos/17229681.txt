hepatitis c virus (hcv) positive-sense single-stranded rna virus. ns5b an
rna-dependent rna polymerase polymerizes newly synthesized rna. hcv
likely uses host proteins replication, similar rna viruses. to
identify cellular factors involved hcv replication, searched for
cellular proteins interact ns5b protein. hnrnp a1 septin 6
proteins identified coimmunoprecipitation yeast two-hybrid screening,
respectively. interestingly, septin 6 protein also interacts hnrnp a1.
moreover, hnrnp a1 interacts 5'-nontranslated region (5' ntr) 3'
ntr hcv rna containing cis-acting elements required replication.
knockdown hnrnp a1 overexpression c-terminally truncated hnrnp a1
reduced hcv replication. addition, knockdown septin 6 overexpression of
n-terminally truncated septin 6 inhibited hcv replication. results indicate
that host proteins hnrnp a1 septin 6 play important roles the
replication hcv rna-protein protein-protein interactions.
