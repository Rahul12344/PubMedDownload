the hepatitis b virus x protein (hbx) plays essential roles viral replication 
and generation hepatocellular carcinoma. spite large number of
suggestive cellular targets functions, clear picture mechanism(s) of
action remained elusive. report, continue characterize its
recently described mitochondrial association examine impact on
mitochondrial functions. hbx previously shown bind voltage-dependent 
anion channel (vdac3) alter mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta 
psi(m)). show that, consequence association mitochondria,
hbx constitutively induces activation transcription factors, include
stat-3 nf-kappa b. induction activation sensitive the
antioxidants n-acetyl l-cysteine pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, well to
overexpression mn-superoxide dismutase. results therefore implicate a
potential role reactive oxygen species (ros) process ultimately
leads activation stat-3 nf-kappa b. evidence also presented 
the hbx-induced generation ros. ability hbx induce activation of
stat-3 nf-kappa b demonstrated mobility shift reporter gene
expression assays lysates hbx-transfected hepg2 cells. c-terminal hbx
deletion mutant, hbx delta 99, failed bind vdac3 activate stat-3 and
nf-kappa b. studies shed new light physiological significance of
hbx's mitochondrial association role inducing oxidative stress which
can contribute liver disease pathogenesis associated hepatitis b 
virus infection.
