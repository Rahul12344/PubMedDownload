background: adenovirus e4orf4 protein must bind protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a)
for functions.
results: e4orf4 binding site pp2a mapped α1,α2 helices the
b55α subunit.
conclusion: e4orf4 binding site pp2a-b55α lies substrate binding
site overlap it.
significance: novel functional significance assigned α1,α2 helices
of pp2a-b55α subunit. adenovirus e4orf4 protein regulates progression
of viral infection expressed outside context virus induces
nonclassical, cancer cell-specific apoptosis. e4orf4 functions known date 
require interaction e4orf4 protein phosphatase 2a (pp2a), is
mediated pp2a regulatory b subunits. specifically, interaction with
the b55α subunit required induction cell death e4orf4. gain a
better insight e4orf4-pp2a interaction, mapping e4orf4
interaction site pp2a-b55α undertaken. end used a
combination bioinformatics analyses pp2a-b55α e4orf4, led to
the prediction e4orf4 binding sites surface pp2a-b55α. mutation
analysis, immunoprecipitation, gst pulldown assays based theoretical
predictions revealed e4orf4 binding site included α1 α2 helices 
described b55α structure involved least three residues located in
these helices facing other. loss e4orf4 binding accompanied by
reduced contribution b55α mutants e4orf4-induced cell death. the
identified e4orf4 binding domain lies previously described substrate
binding site overlap it, although location could consistent
with direct indirect effects substrate binding. work assigns the
first time functional significance α1,α2 helices b55α, suggest
that binding site defined helices could also contribute to
interactions pp2a cellular regulators.
