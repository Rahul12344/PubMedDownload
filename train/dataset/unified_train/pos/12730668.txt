gam1, early adenoviral celo protein, required viral replication.
consistent ability inhibit histone deacetylation hdac1, gam1
activates transcription. report, identify cellular transcription
factor p120(e4f) gam1 interaction partner. p120(e4f) low-abundance
transcription factor represses adenovirus e4 promoter. we
demonstrate p120(e4f) interacts hdac1 vivo vitro, that
e4f-mediated transcriptional repression alleviated hdac inhibitor
trichostatin overexpressing gam1. mutant e4 promoter unresponsive to
e4f-mediated transcriptional repression also stimulated gam1. moreover,
our cofractionation experiments demonstrate p120(e4f), hdac1 gam1 may be
concomitantly present protein complexes. conclude gam1 activates
e4-dependent transcription possibly inactivating hdac1.
