epidemiological studies suggest correlation severity acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (aids) selenium deficiency, indicating protective
role anti-oxidant hiv infection. demonstrate that
thioredoxin reductase-1 (tr1), selenium-containing pyridine
nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase reduces protein disulfides free
thiols, negatively regulates activity hiv-1 encoded transcriptional
activator, tat, human macrophages. used small interfering rna approach as
well high affinity substrate tr1, ebselen, demonstrate that
tat-dependent transcription hiv-1 replication significantly increased in
human macrophages tr1 activity reduced. increase hiv-1
replication tr1 small interfering rna-treated cells independent the
redox-sensitive transcription factor, nf-kappab. studies indicate tr-1
acts negative regulator tat-dependent transcription. furthermore, in
vitro biochemical assays recombinant tat protein confirmed tr1 targets 
two disulfide bonds within cys-rich motif required efficient hiv-1
transactivation. increasing tr1 expression along selenoproteins by
supplementing selenium suggests potential inexpensive adjuvant therapy for
hiv/aids patients.
