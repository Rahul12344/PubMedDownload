mhv68 murine gammaherpesvirus infects laboratory mice thus provides
a tractable small animal model characterizing critical aspects of
gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. evolved natural host,
herpesviruses encode numerous gene products involved modulating host 
immune responses facilitate establishment maintenance lifelong
chronic infection. one protein, mhv68 m1, secreted protein 
known homologs, shown play critical role controlling virus
reactivation latently infected macrophages. previous demonstrated
that m1 drives activation expansion vÎ²4+ cd8+ cells, are
thought involved controlling mhv68 reactivation secretion of
interferon gamma. mechanism action regulation m1 expression are
poorly understood. gain insights function m1, set to
evaluate site expression transcriptional regulation m1 gene.
here, using recombinant virus expressing fluorescent protein driven m1
gene promoter, identify plasma cells major cell type expressing m1 at
the peak infection spleen. addition, show m1 gene
transcription regulated essential viral immediate-early
transcriptional activator rta cellular interferon regulatory factor 4 (irf4),
which together potently synergize drive m1 gene expression. finally, show
that irf4, cellular transcription factor essential plasma cell
differentiation, directly interact rta. latter observation raises
the possibility interaction rta irf4 may involved in
regulating number viral cellular genes mhv68 reactivation linked 
to plasma cell differentiation.
