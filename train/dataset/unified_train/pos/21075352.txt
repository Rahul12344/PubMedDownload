dengue virus encodes several interferon antagonists. among ns5 protein 
binds stat2, necessary component type interferon signaling pathway,
and targets degradation. demonstrate ability dengue ns5
to associate degrade stat2 species specific. thus, ns5 able to
bind degrade human stat2, mouse stat2. difference exploited 
to demonstrate, absent manipulation viral genome, ns5-mediated ifn
antagonism essential efficient virus replication. moreover, demonstrate
that differences ns5 mediated binding degradation human mouse 
stat2 maps region within stat2 coiled-coil domain. using stat2(-/-)
mice, also demonstrate mouse stat2 restricts early dengue virus
replication in vivo. results suggest overcoming restriction
through transgenic mouse technology may help development long-sought 
immune-competent mouse model dengue virus infection.
