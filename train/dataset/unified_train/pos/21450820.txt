the infected cell polypeptide 4 (icp4) herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) a
regulator viral transcription required productive infection. since
viral genes transcribed cellular rna polymerase ii (rna pol ii), icp4 must
interact components pol ii machinery regulate viral gene
expression. shown previously icp4 interacts tata
box-binding protein (tbp), tfiib, tbp-associated factor 1 (taf1) in
vitro. study, icp4-containing complexes isolated infected cells
by tandem affinity purification (tap). forty-six proteins copurified with
icp4 identified mass spectrometry. additional copurifying proteins were
identified western blot analysis. included 11 components tfiid 4 
components mediator complex. significance icp4-mediator
interaction investigated using immunofluorescence chromatin
immunoprecipitation. mediator found colocalize icp4 starting early
and continuing late times infection. addition, mediator recruited 
to viral promoters icp4-dependent manner. taken together, data suggest 
that icp4 interacts components tfiid mediator context viral
infection, may explain broad transactivation properties icp4.
