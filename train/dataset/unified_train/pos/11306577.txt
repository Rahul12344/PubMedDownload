a negative regulatory element (nre) located immediately upstream the
upstream regulatory sequence core promoter second enhancer human
hepatitis b virus (hbv). nre represses transcription activation function of
the upstream regulatory sequence core promoter second enhancer. in
this study, described cloning characterization nre-binding
protein (nrebp) expression cloning. nrebp cdna 8266 nucleotides in
size encodes protein 2386 amino acids predicted molecular mass of
262 kda. three previously described cdnas, dbp-5, sonb, sona, partial
sequence and/or alternatively spliced forms nrebp. genomic locus the
nrebp/son gene composed 13 exons 12 introns. endogenous nrebp
protein localized nucleus human hepatoma huh-7 cells. antibody
against nrebp protein specifically block nre binding activity present 
fractionated nuclear extracts gel shifting assays, indicating nrebp is
the endogenous nuclear protein binds nre sequence. polymerase chain
reaction-assisted binding site selection assay, determined consensus 
sequence nrebp binding ga(g/t)an(c/g)(a/g)cc. overexpression nrebp
enhances repression hbv core promoter activity via nre. overexpression
of nrebp also repress transcription hbv genes production of
hbv virions transient transfection system mimics viral infection in
vivo.
