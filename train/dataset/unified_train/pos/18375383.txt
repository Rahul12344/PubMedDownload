the human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (hiv-1), gp41 core plays important
role fusion viral target cell membranes. previously identified 
an hiv-1 gp41 core-binding motif hxxnpf (where x amino acid residue). in
this study, found asn, pro, phe key residues gp41 core
binding. two npf motifs epsin-1-(470-499), fragment epsin,
which essential accessory factor endocytosis dock plasma
membrane interacting lipid. epsin-1-(470-499) bound significantly 
the gp41 core formed polypeptide n36(l8)c34 interacted the
recombinant soluble gp41 containing core structure. synthetic peptide
containing epsin-1-(470-499) sequence could effectively block entry hiv-1 
virions supt1 cells via endocytosis pathway. results suggest
that interaction epsin gp41 core, may present the
target cell membrane, probably essential endocytosis hiv-1, an
alternative pathway hiv-1 entry target cell.
