background: rate transcription hiv-1 viral genome mediated by
the interaction viral protein tat ltr transcriptional
machinery. specific interactions affected state of
post-translational modifications tat. previously, shown tat can
be phosphorylated acetylated vivo resulting increase rate 
transcription. present study, investigated whether tat could be
methylated lysine residues, specifically lysine 50 51, whether this
modification resulted decrease viral transcription ltr.
results: analyzed association tat histone methyltransferases of
the suv39-family set domain containing proteins vitro. tat found to
associate setdb1 setdb2, two enzymes exhibit
methyltransferase activity. sirna setdb1 transfected cell systems
with transient integrated ltr reporter genes resulted increase 
transcription hiv-ltr presence suboptimal levels tat. in
vitro methylation assays tat peptides containing point mutations lysines 
50 51 showed increased incorporation methyl groups lysine 51,
however, residues indicated susceptibility methylation.
conclusion: association tat histone methyltransferases the
ability tat methylated suggests interesting mechanism of
transcriptional regulation recruitment chromatin remodeling
proteins hiv-1 promoter.
