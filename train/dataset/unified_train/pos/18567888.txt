human respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) constitutes highly pathogenic virus
that infects lung epithelial cells cause wide spectrum respiratory
diseases. recent studies revealed existence an
interferon-alpha/beta-independent, innate antiviral response rsv was
dependent activation nf-kappab. demonstrated nf-kappab inducing
pro-inflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf) confers potent 
antiviral function rsv nf-kappab-dependent fashion, independent 
interferon-alpha/beta. efforts study pathway, identified
hbd2 (human beta-defensin-2), soluble secreted cationic protein antiviral
factor induced nf-kappab-dependent innate antiviral activity human lung
epithelial cells. results demonstrated hbd2 induced tnf rsv in
an nf-kappab-dependent manner. induction hbd2 infected cells mediated
by paracrine/autocrine action tnf produced upon rsv infection. hbd2 plays 
a critical role host defense, purified hbd2 drastically inhibited 
rsv infection. also show antiviral mechanism hbd2 involves
blocking viral cellular entry possibly of
destabilization/disintegration viral envelope. important role hbd2 
in innate response also evident loss antiviral activity tnf
upon hbd2 silencing short interfering rna. vivo physiological relevance
of hbd2 host defense apparent induction murine beta-defensin-4
(murine counterpart hbd2) lung tissues rsv-infected mice. thus, hbd2
functions antiviral molecule nf-kappab-dependent innate antiviral
immunity mediated autocrine/paracrine action tnf.
