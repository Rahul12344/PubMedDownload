gli proteins involved development mice, humans, zebrafish,
caenorhabditis elegans, xenopus, drosophila. zinc
finger-containing proteins bind tg-rich promoter elements known to
regulate gene expression c. elegans drosophila, mechanistic understanding 
of regulation mediated naturally occurring transcriptional
promoters lacking. one isoform human gli-2 appears identical a
factor previously called tax helper protein (thp), thus named due ability 
to interact tg-rich element human t-lymphotropic virus type 1
(htlv-1) enhancer thought mediate transcriptional stimulation tax
protein htlv-1. demonstrate that, working tg-rich binding
site adjacent elements, gli-2/thp actually suppresses gene expression driven 
by htlv-1 promoter. gli-2/thp effect htlv-2 promoter, activates
expression promoters human immunodeficiency virus types 1 (hiv-1 
and -2), stimulates hiv-1 replication. effective suppression and
activation gene expression viral replication require first five
zinc fingers, necessary dna binding, intact. thus, not
only gli-2/thp either activate suppress gene expression, depending 
promoter, domain (first zinc finger) mediates effects. these
findings suggest role gli-2 retroviral gene regulation shed 
light mechanisms gli proteins regulate naturally occurring
promoters.
