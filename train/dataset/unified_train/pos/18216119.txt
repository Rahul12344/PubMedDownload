the epstein-barr virus c promoter (cp) regulates major multicistronic
transcript encoding ebna-lp, 1, 2, 3 genes required b-cell
proliferation latency. growth-transforming potential viral
genes suggests must tightly regulated host cell cycle and
differentiation process. better understand cp regulation, used dna affinity
purification identify cellular viral proteins bind cp latently 
infected cells. several previously unknown factors identified, including the
cell cycle regulatory proteins e2f1 rb. e2f1 bound specific site cp
located core cp region 3' known ebna2-responsive rbp-jk (csl, cbf1)
binding site. histone h3 k4 demethylase lsd1 (bcc110) also identified 
dna affinity shown form stable complex rb.
coimmunoprecipitation assays demonstrated e2f1, rb, lsd1 bind cp a
cell cycle-dependent manner. rb lsd1 binding cp increased s
phase, corresponding decrease histone h3 k4 methylation cp
transcription. coimmunoprecipitation immunofluorescence assays reveal that
lsd1 interacts rb. surprisingly, lsd1 coimmunoprecipitate e2f1,
suggesting associates rb independently e2f1. depletion lsd1 by
small interfering rnas inhibited cp basal transcription levels, and
overexpression lsd1 altered cell cycle profile p53-positive (p53(+)),
but p53-negative (p53(-)), hct cells. findings indicate cp a
cell cycle-regulated promoter control rb histone
demethylase lsd1 multiple latency types.
