deletions mutations retinoblastoma gene, rb1, common features of
many tumors tumor cell lines. recently, rb1 gene product, p105-rb, has
been shown form stable protein/protein complexes oncoproteins two 
dna tumor viruses, adenovirus e1a proteins simian virus 40 (sv40)
large antigen. neither viruses thought associated human 
cancer, cause tumors rodents. binding rb
anti-oncoprotein adenovirus sv40 oncoprotein recapitulated in
vitro coimmunoprecipitation mixing assays. assays used to
demonstrate e7 oncoprotein human papilloma virus type-16 form
similar complexes p105-rb. human papilloma virus-16 found associated with
approximately 50 percent cervical carcinomas. results suggest these
three dna viruses may utilize similar mechanisms transformation implicate 
rb binding possible step human papilloma virus-associated carcinogenesis.
