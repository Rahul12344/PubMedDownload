the e2 protein papillomaviruses binds specific sites viral genome to
regulate transcription, replication segregation mitosis. amino acid
substitutions transactivation domain (tad) e2, arg37 ile73, have
been shown previously impair transcriptional activity protein but
not ability support viral dna replication. understand biochemical
basis defect, used tads low-risk (hpv11) high-risk
(hpv31) human papillomavirus (hpv) affinity ligands capture proteins from
whole cell extracts associate domains. major tad-binding 
protein identified mass spectrometry western blotting long
isoform brd4. binding brd4 also demonstrated e2 tads other
papillomaviruses including cutaneous animal types. hpv11, hpv31 crpv 
e2, found binding brd4 significantly reduced substitutions of
arg37 ile73. since amino acids located near the
3-dimensional structure tad, suggest define conserved
surface involved binding brd4 regulate viral gene transcription.
