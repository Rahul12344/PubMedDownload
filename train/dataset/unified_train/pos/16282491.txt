mammalian cells viruses encode inhibitors programmed cell death that
localize mitochondria suppress apoptosis initiated wide variety of
inducers. mutagenesis used probe role predicted alpha-helical
region within hydrophobic antiapoptotic domain (aad) cytomegalovirus vmia,
the ul37x1 gene product. region found essential cell death
suppression activity. screen proteins interacted aad of
functional vmia failed interact mutants identified growth arrest
and dna damage 45 (gadd45alpha), cell cycle regulatory protein activated by
genotoxic stress, candidate cellular binding partner. gadd45alpha
interaction required aad alpha-helical character also dictated
gadd45alpha-mediated enhancement death suppression. vmia mutants failed
to interact gadd45alpha completely nonfunctional cell death
suppression, three gadd45 family members (gadd45alpha,
gadd45beta/myd118, gadd45gamma/oig37/cr6/grp17) able cooperate with
vmia; however, none influenced cell death introduced cells alone.
gadd45alpha found increase vmia protein levels comparably treatment
with protease inhibitors mg132 alln. targeted short interfering rna knockdown
of three gadd45 family members maximally reduced vmia activity, this
reduction abrogated additional gadd45alpha. interestingly, gadd45 family
members also able bind enhance cell death suppression bcl-xl, a
member bcl-2 family cell death suppressors, suggesting direct
cooperative link apoptosis proteins regulate dna damage 
response.
