the complement system plays essential protective role initial defense
against many microorganisms. flavivirus ns1 secreted nonstructural
glycoprotein accumulates blood, displayed surface infected
cells, hypothesized immune evasion functions. herein, we
demonstrate dengue virus (denv), west nile virus (wnv), yellow fever
virus (yfv) ns1 attenuate classical lectin pathway activation directly
interacting c4. binding ns1 c4 reduced c4b deposition c3
convertase (c4b2a) activity. although ns1 bound c4b, lacked intrinsic cofactor
activity degrade c4b, block c3 convertase formation accelerate 
decay c3 c5 convertases. instead, ns1 enhanced c4 cleavage by
recruiting activating complement-specific protease c1s. binding c1s
and c4 complex, ns1 promotes efficient degradation c4 c4b. through
this mechanism, ns1 protects denv complement-dependent neutralization in
solution. studies define novel immune evasion mechanism restricting
complement control microbial infection.
