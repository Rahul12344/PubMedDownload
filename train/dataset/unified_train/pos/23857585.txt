hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection results activation numerous stress
responses including oxidative stress, potential induce apoptotic
state. previously shown hcv attenuates stress-induced,
p38mapk-mediated up-regulation k(+) channel kv2.1, maintain the
survival infected cells face cellular stress. demonstrated that
this effect mediated hcv non-structural 5a (ns5a) protein, impaired 
p38mapk activity polyproline motif-dependent interaction, resulting 
reduction phosphorylation activation kv2.1. study, investigated 
the host cell proteins targeted ns5a mediate kv2.1 inhibition. screened 
a phage-display library expressing entire complement human sh3 domains for
novel ns5a-host cell interactions. analysis identified mixed lineage kinase 
3 (mlk3) putative ns5a interacting partner. mlk3 serine/threonine
protein kinase member mapk kinase kinase (map3k) family and
activates p38mapk. ns5a-mlk3 interaction confirmed by
co-immunoprecipitation western blot analysis. demonstrate novel 
role mlk3 modulation kv2.1 activity, whereby mlk3 overexpression
leads up-regulation channel activity. accordingly, coexpression ns5a
suppressed stimulation. additionally demonstrate overexpression of
mlk3 induced apoptosis, also counteracted ns5a. conclude that
ns5a targets mlk3 multiple downstream consequences apoptosis and
k(+) homeostasis.
