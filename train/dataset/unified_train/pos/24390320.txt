the hiv-1 virion infectivity factor (vif) targets cellular cytidine
deaminases apobec3g (a3g) apobec3f (a3f) degradation via host
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. vif recruits cellular e3 ubiquitin ligase to
polyubiquitinate a3g/f. activity vif critically depends cellular
core binding factor beta (cbfβ). study, investigated vif-cbfβ
interaction role cbfβ e3 ligase assembly. vif-cbfβ interaction 
requires extensive region vif spanning amino terminus zinc 
finger region, cullin 5 (cul5) binding enhances stability vif-cbfβ
interaction. results demonstrate cbfβ plays critical role in
facilitating cul5 binding vif/elongin b/elongin c complex. vif, or
without bound substrate, unable bind cul5 absence cbfβ. these
studies support notion cbfβ serves molecular chaperone to
facilitate vif-e3 ligase assembly.importance: host antiviral restriction
factors a3g/f inhibit viral replication. hiv-1 protein vif targets a3g/f 
degradation. immune evasion activity vif dependent cellular
factor cbfβ. multiple regions vif known important vif function, 
but mechanisms unclear. studies described provide important
information vif-cbfβ interaction interface function cbfβ 
e3 ligase assembly. particular, comprehensive vif-cbfβ interface mapping
results help delineate role various vif regions, determining they
are important binding cbfβ a3g/f. furthermore, studies reveal an
important potential mechanism cbfβ shown before. results
suggest cbfβ may serve molecular chaperone enable vif adopt an
appropriate conformation interaction cul5-based e3 ligase. this
study advances understanding cbfβ facilitates vif-mediated
degradation apobec3 proteins.
