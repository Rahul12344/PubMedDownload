the cellular factor, lbp-1, repress hiv-1 transcription preventing the
binding tfiid promoter. analyzed effect recombinant
lbp-1 hiv-1 transcription vitro using "pulse-chase" assay. lbp-1 had
no effect initiation preformed preinitiation complex elongation 
position +13 ("pulse"). however, addition lbp-1 rna polymerase was
stalled +13 strongly inhibited elongation ("chase") reducing rna
polymerase processivity. severe mutations high affinity lbp-1 binding
sites -4 +21 relieve lbp-1-dependent block. however,
lbp-1 could bind independently upstream low affinity sites (-80 -4),
suggesting sites mediate effect lbp-1 elongation. these
results demonstrate novel function lbp-1, restricting hiv-1 transcription at
the level elongation. addition, tat found suppress the
antiprocessivity effect lbp-1 hiv-1 transcription nuclear extracts.
these findings strongly suggest lbp-1 may provide natural mechanism for
restricting elongation hiv-1 transcripts may target for
the action tat enhancing transcription.
