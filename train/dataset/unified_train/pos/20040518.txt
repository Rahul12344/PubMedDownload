this study describes first time ability novel brca1-binding
protein 2 (brap2) inhibit nuclear import specific viral proteins
dependent phosphorylation. ectopic expression brap2 transfected african 
green monkey kidney cos-7 cells found significantly reduce nuclear
localization signal (nls)-dependent nuclear accumulation either simian virus
sv40 large-tumor antigen (t-ag) human cytomegalovirus dna polymerase
processivity factor ppul44; also observed hl-60 human promyelocytic
leukemia cells induction brap2 expression vitamin d3 treatment. brap2
inhibition nuclear accumulation dependent phosphorylation sites
flanking respective nlss, substitution cyclin-dependent kinase
site t124 t-ag ala asp prevented enhanced brap2 inhibition of
nuclear import, respectively. substitution t427 within nls ppul44 gave 
similar results, whereas effect brap2 observed nuclear targeting 
other viral proteins, herpes simplex virus-1 pul30, lacks a
phosphorylation site near nls, human immunodeficiency virus-1 tat
protein. pulldowns/alphascreen assays indicated direct, high-affinity binding 
brap2(442-592) t-ag(111-135), strictly dependent negative charge t124
and nls. results consistent brap2 novel,
phosphorylation-regulated negative regulator nuclear import, potential as
an antiviral agent.
