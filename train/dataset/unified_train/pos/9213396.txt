the observation hiv vitro infect cd4- gal-c-negative brain cell
lines stimulated study identify alternative gp120-binding proteins on
brain cells. hiv-1 gp120 binding proteins cd4-negative gal-c-negative,
non-productively infectable human glioblastoma cell line d54 purified by
affinity chromatography gp120-conjugated sepharose column identified
by peptide microsequencing. binding capacity specificity column
was controlled using extracts cd4-positive cells. two seven prominent
proteins eluted gp120 affinity column specifically bound gp120 in
western blot overlay experiments identified subsequent immunoblotting
and microsequencing ezrin moesin, members erm (ezrin, radixin,
moesin) family cellular structural membrane proteins. antibodies ezrin 
moesin specifically recognized eluted gp120 binding proteins confirming their
identification. ezrin moesin structural proteins binding cellular 
membrane several cytoskeletal transmembrane proteins. results
suggest ezrin moesin might play role gp160/gp120 binding proteins
during uptake, assembly budding hiv.
