hypusine formation eukaryotic initiation factor 5a (eif-5a) precursor
represents unique posttranslational modification ubiquitously present
in eukaryotic cells archaebacteria. specific inhibition deoxyhypusine
synthase leads growth arrest cell death. precise cellular function 
eif-5a physiological significance hypusine modification clear.
although methionyl-puromycin synthesis suggested the
functional assay eif-5a activity vitro, role eif-5a protein
synthesis established. recent studies suggested eif-5a may
be cellular target human immunodeficiency virus type 1 rev human t
cell leukemia virus type 1 rex proteins. motif analysis suggested eif-5a
resembles bimodular rna-binding protein contains stretch basic 
amino acids clustered n-terminal region leucine-rich stretch 
c-terminal region. using rev target rna, rre, model, tested the
hypothesis eif-5a may rna-binding protein. found both
deoxyhypusine hypusine-containing eif-5a bind 252-nt rre rna, as
determined gel mobility shift assay. contrast, unmodified eif-5a
precursor cannot. deoxyhypusine-containing eif-5a, precursor, could
also cause supershift rev stem-loop iib rre complex. preliminary studies
also indicated eif-5a bind rna u6 snrna that
deoxyhypusine modification appears required binding. ability of
eif-5a directly interact rna suggests deoxyhypusine formation of
eif-5a may related role rna processing protein synthesis. our
study also suggests possibility using gel mobility shift assay for
eif-5a-rna binding functional assay deoxyhypusine hypusine
formation.
