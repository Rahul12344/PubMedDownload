myxoma virus (myxv)-encoded protein m029 member poxvirus e3 family of
dsrna-binding proteins antagonize cellular interferon signaling
pathways. order investigate additional functions m029, have
constructed series targeted m029-minus (vmyx-m029ko vmyx-m029id) and
v5-tagged m029 myxv. found m029 plays pivotal role determining the
cellular tropism myxv mammalian cells tested. m029-minus viruses
were able replicate engineered cell lines stably express a
complementing protein, vaccinia e3, underwent abortive abated
infection tested mammalian cell lines. m029-minus viruses were
dramatically attenuated susceptible host european rabbits caused no
observable signs myxomatosis. using v5-tagged m029 virus, observed that
m029 expressed early viral protein localized nuclear and
cytosolic compartments virus-infected cells, also incorporated into
virions. using proteomic approaches, identified protein kinase r (pkr)
and rna helicase (rha)/dhx9 two cellular binding partners m029 protein.
in virus-infected cells, m029 interacts pkr dsrna-dependent manner,
while binding dhx9 dependent dsrna. significantly, pkr knockdown 
in human cells rescued replication defect m029-knockout viruses.
unexpectedly, rescue m029-minus virus replication pkr depletion could 
then reversed rha/dhx9 knockdown human monocytic thp1 cells. this
indicates m029 inhibits generic pkr anti-viral pathways, also
binds conscripts rha/dhx9 pro-viral effector promote virus
replication thp1 cells. thus, m029 critical host range virulence
factor myxv required replication mammalian cells by
antagonizing pkr-mediated anti-viral functions, also conscripts pro-viral
rha/dhx9 promote viral replication specifically myeloid cells.
