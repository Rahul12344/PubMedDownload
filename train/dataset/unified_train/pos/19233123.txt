hepatitis b virus (hbv) small dna virus targets liver infects
humans worldwide. recently shown metabolic regulator pgc-1alpha 
coactivates hbv transcription thereby rendering virus susceptible to
fluctuations nutritional status liver. pgc-1alpha coactivation of
hbv mediated liver-enriched nuclear receptor hnf4alpha through
another yet unknown transcription factor(s). show forkhead
transcription factor foxo1, known target pgc-1alpha coactivation a
central mediator glucose metabolism liver, binds hbv core promoter 
activates transcription. activation enhanced presence 
of pgc-1alpha, implying foxo1 target pgc-1alpha coactivation hbv
transcription. thus, results identify another key metabolic regulator an
activator hbv transcription, thereby supporting principle hbv gene
expression regulated similar way key hepatic metabolic genes.
