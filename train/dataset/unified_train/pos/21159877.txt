most retroviruses express genes single primary transcript. in
order allow expression one gene rna, differential
splicing extensively used. cellular quality control mechanisms retain and
degrade unspliced partially spliced rnas nucleus. two pathways have
been described explain retroviruses circumvent nuclear export
inhibition. one involves constitutive transport element viral rna that
interacts cellular mrna transporter proteins nxf1 nxt1 facilitate
nuclear export. pathway relies recognition viral rna
element virus-encoded protein interacts karyopherin crm1. in
this report, analyze protein factors required nuclear export of
unspliced foamy virus (fv) mrna. show export crm1 dependent. in
contrast complex retroviruses, fvs encode export-mediating
protein. cross-linking experiments indicated cellular protein hur binds 
to fv rna. inhibition studies showed anp32a anp32b, are
known bridge hur crm1, essential fv rna export. using this
export pathway, fvs solve central problem viral replication.
