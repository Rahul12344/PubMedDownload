to identify proteins bind 3' untranslated region (utr) hepatitis 
c virus (hcv) screened human cdna libraries using saccharomyces cerevisiae
three-hybrid system. screening rna sequence derived 3'-terminal 
98 nucleotides (3'x region) infectious clone hcv (h77c) yielded clones
of human ribosomal proteins l22, l3, s3, ml3, mitochondrial homologue of
l3. performed preliminary characterization binding 3'x
region proteins three-hybrid mating assay using mutant 3'x
sequences. characterized interaction 3'x l22,
since protein known associated two small epstein-barr virus
(ebv)-encoded rna species (ebers) abundantly produced cells latently
infected ebv. ebers, similar predicted secondary structure to
the hcv 3'x, assemble ribonucleoprotein particles include l22 la
protein. confirm l22 binds hcv 3'x performed vitro binding assays
using recombinant l22 (expressed glutathione s-transferase [gst] fusion
protein) together 3'x riboprobe. 3'x region binds gst-l22
fusion protein (but gst alone), interaction subject to
competition unlabeled 3'x rna. establish functional role played by
l22 internal ribosome entry site (ires)-mediated translation hcv sequences 
we performed translational analysis huh-7 cells using monocistronic and
bicistronic reporter constructs. relative amount core-chloramphenicol
acetyltransferase reporter protein translated control hcv ires
was stimulated presence l22 la proteins supplied in
trans.
