the herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) immediate early protein icp0 performs many
functions infection, including transactivation viral gene expression,
suppression innate immune responses, modification eviction histones
from viral chromatin. although functions icp0 characterized,
the detailed mechanisms underlying icp0's complex role infection warrant
further investigation. thus undertook unbiased proteomic approach to
identifying viral cellular proteins interact icp0 infected
cell. cellular candidates resulting analysis included the
ubiquitin-specific protease usp7, transcriptional repressor trim27, dna
repair proteins nbn mre11a, regulators apoptosis, including birc6, the
proteasome. also identified two hsv-1 early proteins involved nucleotide
metabolism, ul39 ul50, novel candidate interactors icp0. trim27
was statistically significant cellular candidate, investigated the
relationship trim27 icp0. observed rapid, icp0-dependent loss of
trim27 hsv-1 infection. trim27 protein levels restored disrupting 
the ring domain icp0 inhibiting proteasome, arguing trim27 a
novel degradation target icp0. mutant icp0 lacking e3 ligase activity
interacted endogenous trim27 infection demonstrated reciprocal 
coimmunoprecipitation supported immunofluorescence data. surprisingly,
icp0-null mutant virus yields decreased upon trim27 depletion, arguing that
trim27 positive effect infection despite targeted degradation.
these results illustrate complex interaction trim27 viral infection
with potential positive negative effects trim27 hsv different
infection conditions.importance: productive infection, virus must
simultaneously redirect multiple cellular pathways replicate while
evading detection host's defenses. orchestrate complex regulation,
viruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1), rely multifunctional
proteins e3 ubiquitin ligase icp0. protein regulates various
cellular pathways concurrently targeting diverse set cellular factors for
degradation. targets previously identified and
characterized, undertook proteomic screen identify additional targets 
this activity characterize icp0's role infection. describe a
set candidate interacting proteins icp0 identified approach
and characterization statistically significant result, the
cellular transcriptional repressor trim27. present trim27 novel
degradation target icp0 describe relationship two proteins
during infection.
