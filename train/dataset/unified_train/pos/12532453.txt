aim: investigate interaction hepatitis c virus core protein and
translin protein role pathogenensis hepatocellular carcinoma
and lymphoma.
methods: components yeast two hybrid system 3, "bait" plasmids of
hcv core gene constructed. proving hepatitis c virus core
protein could firmly expressed ah109 yeast strains, yeast two- hybrid
screening performed mating ah109 y187 transformed liver
cdna library plasmids-pact2 plated quadruple dropout (qdo) medium and
then assayed alpha-gal activity. sequencing analysis genes library 
plasmids yeast colonies could grow qdo alpha-gal activity was
performed. interaction hcv core protein protein obtained
from positive colony confirmed repeating yeast two - hybrid
analysis coimmunoprecipitation vitro.
results: gene positive colony gene translin, recombination 
hotspot binding protein. interaction hcv core protein translin
protein could proved yeast, also vitro.
conclusion: core protein hcv interact translin protein. 
partly explain molecular mechanism hepatocellular carcinoma lymphoma 
caused hcv.
