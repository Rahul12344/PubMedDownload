polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (pabpc1) cytoplasmic-nuclear
shuttling protein important protein translation initiation rna
processing stability. report pabpc1 forms complex kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (kshv) orf57 protein, allows orf57 to
interact 9-nucleotide (nt) core element kshv polyadenylated nuclear
(pan) rna, viral long noncoding rna (lncrna), increase pan stability. the
n-terminal rna recognition motifs (rrms) pabpc1 necessary direct
interaction orf57. kshv lytic infection, expression viral
orf57 leads substantial decrease overall pabpc1 expression, along 
shift cellular distribution remaining pabpc1 nucleus.
interestingly, pabpc1 orf57 opposing functions modulating pan
steady-state accumulation. suppressive effect pabpc1 specific pan
expression alleviated small interfering rna knockdown pabpc1 by
overexpression orf57. conversely, ectopic pabpc1 reduces orf57 steady-state
protein levels induces aberrant polyadenylation pan thereby indirectly
inhibits orf57-mediated pan accumulation. however, e1b-ap5 (heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein u-like 1), interacts region outside 9-nt core 
to stimulate pan expression, interact even colocalize orf57.
unlike pabpc1, nuclear distribution e1b-ap5 remains unchanged viral
lytic infection overexpression orf57. together, data indicate that
pabpc1 important cellular target viral orf57 directly upregulate pan 
accumulation viral lytic infection, ability host pabpc1 to
disrupt orf57 expression strategic host counterbalancing mechanism.
