persistent infection hepatitis c virus (hcv) major cause chronic
liver diseases. aim study identify host cell factor(s)
participating hcv replication complex (rc) clarify regulatory
mechanisms viral genome replication dependent host-derived factor(s)
identified. comparative proteome analysis rc-rich membrane fractions and
subsequent gene silencing mediated rna interference, identified several
candidates rc components involved hcv replication. found one of
these candidates, creatine kinase b (ckb), key atp-generating enzyme that
regulates atp subcellular compartments nonmuscle cells, important for
efficient replication hcv genome propagation infectious virus. ckb 
interacts hcv ns4a protein forms complex ns3-4a, possesses 
multiple enzyme activities. ckb upregulates ns3-4a-mediated unwinding rna
and dna vitro replicase activity permeabilized hcv replicating cells.
our results support model recruitment ckb hcv rc
compartment, high fluctuating energy demands, its
interaction ns4a important efficient replication viral genome.
the ckb-ns4a association potential target development new type 
of antiviral therapeutic strategy.
