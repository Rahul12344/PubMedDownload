hiv-1 circulates free virus within immune cells, level of
free virus predictive clinical course. forms hiv-1 cross the
blood-brain barrier (bbb) much progress made understanding the
mechanisms infected immune cells cross blood-brain barrier bbb. 
hiv-1 free virus crosses bbb less clear brain endothelial cells 
cd4 galactosylceramide negative. here, found hiv-1 use the
mannose-6 phosphate receptor (m6pr) cross bbb. brain perfusion studies
showed hiv-1 crossed bbb brain regions consistent the
uniform distribution m6pr. ultrastructural studies showed hiv-1 crossed a
transcytotic pathway consistent transport m6pr. vitro model 
bbb used show transport hiv-1 inhibited mannose, mannan,
and mannose-6 phosphate enzymatic removal high mannose
oligosaccharide residues hiv-1 reduced transport. wheatgerm agglutinin and
protamine sulfate, substances known greatly increase transcytosis hiv-1
across bbb vivo, shown active vitro model act 
through mannose-dependent mechanism. transport also camp and
calcium-dependent, latter suggesting cation-dependent member 
m6pr family mediates hiv-1 transport across bbb. conclude m6pr 
important receptor used hiv-1 cross bbb.
