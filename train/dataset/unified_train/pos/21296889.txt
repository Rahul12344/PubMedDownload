hantaviruses, members bunyaviridae family, negative-stranded emerging 
rna viruses category pathogens cause serious illness transmitted 
to humans aerosolized excreta infected rodent hosts. hantaviruses have
evolved novel translation initiation mechanism, operated nucleocapsid
protein (n), preferentially facilitates translation viral mrnas. n
binds ribosomal protein s19 (rps19), structural component 40 s
ribosomal subunit. addition, n also binds viral mrna 5' cap 
highly conserved triplet repeat sequence viral mrna 5' utr. the
simultaneous binding n terminal cap 5' utr favors ribosome
loading viral transcripts translation initiation. characterized 
binding n rps19 demonstrate role n-rps19 interaction
in n-mediated translation initiation mechanism. show n specifically binds
to rps19 high affinity binding stoichiometry 1:1. n-rps19
interaction enthalpy-driven process. rps19 undergoes conformational
change binding n. using t7 rna polymerase, synthesized hantavirus
s segment mrna, matches transcript generated viral rna-dependent
rna polymerase cells. show n-rps19 interaction plays critical
role translation mrna cells rabbit reticulocyte
lysates. results demonstrate n-mediated translation initiation
mechanism, lures host translation machinery preferential
translation viral transcripts, primarily depends n-rps19 interaction.
we suggest n-rps19 interaction novel target shut the
n-mediated translation strategy hence virus replication cells.
