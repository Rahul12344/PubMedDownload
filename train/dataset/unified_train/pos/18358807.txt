glycoprotein b (gb) one essential components infection herpes
simplex virus-1 (hsv-1). although several cellular receptors associate 
glycoprotein (gd), herpes virus entry mediator (hvem) nectin-1,
have identified, specific molecules mediate hsv-1 infection by
associating gb elucidated. here, found paired
immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (pilr) alpha associates gb, cells
transduced pilralpha become susceptible hsv-1 infection. furthermore,
hsv-1 infection human primary cells expressing hvem pilralpha was
blocked either anti-pilralpha anti-hvem antibody. results demonstrate
that cellular receptors gb gd required hsv-1 infection and
that pilralpha plays important role hsv-1 infection coreceptor that
associates gb. findings uncover crucial aspect mechanism
underlying hsv-1 infection.
