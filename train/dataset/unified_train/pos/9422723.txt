necdin nuclear protein expressed virtually postmitotic neurons, and
ectopic expression protein strongly suppresses proliferation of
nih3t3 cells. simian virus 40 large antigen targets p53 the
retinoblastoma protein (rb) cellular transformation. analogy the
interactions large antigen nuclear growth suppressors, we
examined ability necdin bind large antigen. necdin was
co-immunoprecipitated large antigen nuclear extract necdin
cdna-transfected cos-1 cells. yeast two-hybrid vitro binding analyses
revealed necdin bound amino-terminal region large antigen,
which encompasses rb-binding domain. moreover, necdin bound adenovirus
e1a, another viral oncoprotein forms specific complex rb. then
examined ability necdin bind transcription factor e2f1, a
cellular rb-binding factor involved cell-cycle progression. intriguingly,
necdin, like rb, bound carboxyl-terminal domain e2f1, repressed
e2f-dependent transactivation vivo. addition, necdin suppressed colony 
formation rb-deficient saos-2 osteosarcoma cells. results suggest that
necdin postmitotic neuron-specific growth suppressor functionally
similar rb.
