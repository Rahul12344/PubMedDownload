retroviruses retrotransposons vulnerable suicidal pathway known as
autointegration, occurs 3'-ends reverse transcript are
activated integrase attack sites within viral dna. retroelements 
have diverse strategies suppressing autointegration, hiv-1 protects
itself autointegration well-understood. show knocking
down components set complex, endoplasmic
reticulum-associated complex contains 3 dnases (the base excision repair
endonuclease ape1, 5'-3' exonuclease trex1, endonuclease nm23-h1), inhibits
hiv-1 hiv-2/siv, mlv asv, infection. inhibition occurs step
in viral life cycle reverse transcription chromosomal
integration. antibodies set complex proteins capture hiv-1 dna the
cytoplasm, suggesting direct interaction set complex hiv
preintegration complex. cloning hiv integration sites cells knocked
down set complex components revealed increase autointegration, was
verified using novel semi-quantitative nested pcr assay detect
autointegrants. set complex proteins knocked down, autointegration
increases 2-3-fold chromosomal integration correspondingly decreases
approximately 3-fold. therefore, set complex facilitates hiv-1 infection by
preventing suicidal autointegration.
