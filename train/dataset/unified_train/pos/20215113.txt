moloney leukemia virus 10 (mov10) protein superfamily-1 rna helicase, it
is also component rna-induced silencing complex. recent studies have
shown mov10 plays active role rna interference pathway. here, we
report mov10 inhibits retrovirus replication. overexpressed in
viral producer cells, mov10 able reduce infectivity human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), simian immunodeficiency virus, murine 
leukemia virus. conversely, mov10 expression reduced small
interfering rnas, hiv-1 infectivity increased. consistently, silencing of
mov10 expression human cell line enhanced hiv-1 replication. furthermore, 
we found mov10 interacts hiv-1 nucleocapsid protein rna-dependent
manner packaged virions. blocks hiv-1 replication postentry
step. addition, also found hiv-1 could suppress mov10 protein
expression counteract cellular resistance. results indicate 
that mov10 broad antiretroviral activity target wide range of
retroviruses, could actively involved host defense against
retroviral infection.
