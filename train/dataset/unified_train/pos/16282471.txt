during lytic infection epithelial cells expression herpes simplex virus
type 1 (hsv-1) immediate-early (ie) genes initiated multiprotein complex 
comprising virion-associated protein vp16 two cellular proteins, host
cellular factor (hcf) oct-1. oct-1 directly recognizes taatgarat elements 
promoters ie genes. role hcf clear. hsv-1 also infects sensory
neurons innervating site productive infection establishes latent
infection cells. likely vp16 retained hsv-1
nucleocapsid reaches neuronal nucleus. activity must therefore be
suppressed successful establishment viral latency. recently, discovered
an hcf-binding cellular protein called zhangfei. zhangfei, hcf-dependent
manner, inhibits luman/lzip/creb3, another cellular hcf-binding transcription
factor. show zhangfei selectively expressed human neurons.
when delivered cultured cells normally express protein,
zhangfei inhibited ability vp16 activate hsv-1 ie expression. the
inhibition specific hcf-dependent transcriptional activation vp16,
since gal4-vp16 chimeric protein inhibited taatgarat-containing
promoter gal4-containing promoter. zhangfei associated vp16
and inhibited formation vp16-hcf-oct-1 complex taatgarat motifs.
zhangfei also suppressed hsv-1-induced expression several cellular genes
including topoisomerase iialpha, suggesting addition suppressing ie
expression zhangfei may inhibitory effect hsv-1 dna replication and
late gene expression.
