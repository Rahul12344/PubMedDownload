tumor suppressor protein promyelocytic leukemia (pml) implicated apoptosis 
regulation antiviral response. pml localizes predominantly pml-nuclear
bodies (pml-nb), nuclear macromolecular complexes regulating tumor suppressor
protein p53 activity. consistent function pml cellular
antiviral response, pml-nbs represent preferential targets viral infections.
in case hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection, important characteristics are
nonresponsiveness ifn therapy development hepatocellular carcinoma.
however, mechanisms lead development hepatocellular carcinoma
are largely unknown. here, show hcv core protein localizes cell
nucleus pml-nbs, colocalizes p53. hcv core interacts with
endogenously expressed pml isoform iv (pml-iv), key regulator p53 activity. 
importantly, show hcv core protein inhibits pml-iv-induced apoptosis 
interferes coactivator function pml-iv proapoptotic p53 target
genes including cd95 (fas/apo-1). particular, found hcv core
inhibits p53-mediated target gene expression predominantly targeting the
coactivator function pml-iv hcv core-mediated p53 target gene
repression absent pml-ablated cells. hcv core expression abrogated both
p53 serine 15 phosphorylation lysine 382 acetylation, two p53-activating
posttranslational modifications previously linked increased
pml-nb formation. taken together, results suggest potential mechanism for
hcv-associated development hepatocellular carcinoma hcv core-mediated 
inactivation pml tumor suppressor pathway.
