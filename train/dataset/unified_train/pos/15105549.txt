the human herpesvirus 6 (hhv-6) immediate-early (ie) 1 protein undergoes
sumoylation events infectious process. present work, report 
that lys-802 (k-802) ie1 hhv-6 variant b target residue
capable conjugation sumo-1/smt3c/sentrin-1, sumo-2/smt3a/sentrin-3 or
sumo-3/smt3b/sentrin-2 determined transfection vitro sumoylation
experiments. polysumoylated forms ie1 also observed, suggesting sumo
branching occurs k-802 residue. overexpression sumo-1, -2 -3 led to
an overall increase ie1 levels, irrespective k-802. sumo residues could
be efficiently removed incubating sumoylated ie1 senp1, recently
identified sumo peptidase. sumoylation-deficient mutants ie1 co-localized with
nuclear promyelocytic leukaemia protein (pml) oncogenic domains (pods) as
efficiently wt ie1, indicating pod targeting independent ie1
sumoylation status. however, contrast infection, pods aggregate 
ie1b-transfected cells, suggesting viral proteins involved 
process. transactivation studies indicated ie1, combination ie2,
could efficiently transactivate diverse promoters, independent sumoylation
status. overall, results presented provide detailed biochemical
characterization post-translational modifications hhv-6 ie1 protein 
sumo peptides, contributing understanding complex interactions
between herpesviruses sumo-conjugation pathway.
