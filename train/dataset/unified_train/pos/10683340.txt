latent membrane protein 2a (lmp2a) expressed latent epstein-barr virus
(ebv) infection. lmp2a functions downregulate b-cell signal transduction and
viral reactivation latency ebv-immortalized b cells vitro, acts to
provide b cells survival developmental signal vivo.
identification proteins associated lmp2a important elucidation 
the mechanism lmp2a employs regulate b-cell signal transduction ebv
latency. lmp2a constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated associated with
protein tyrosine kinases lyn syk specific lmp2a tyrosines are
phosphorylated. amino-terminal domain lmp2a includes multiple proline-rich
regions, may provide binding sites proteins containing sh3 ww
domains. study, demonstrate four cellular proteins bind
specifically two ppppy (py) motifs present within lmp2a amino-terminal
domain. protein microsequence analysis determined three proteins
were aip4, wwp2/aip2, nedd4. proteins members the
nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases family conserved domains including 
the c2, ww, ubiquitin-protein ligase domain. mutation py motifs
completely abolished binding activity proteins lmp2a the
interaction aip4 wwp2 lmp2a confirmed cell lines expressing
lmp2a, wwp2, aip4. furthermore, reduction level lyn rapid
turnover lmp2a lyn observed lmp2a-expressing cells. findings
suggest lmp2a recruits nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases b-cell
signal transduction molecules, resulting degradation lmp2a lyn a
ubiquitin-dependent mechanism. provides new means lmp2a may
modulate b-cell signal transduction.
