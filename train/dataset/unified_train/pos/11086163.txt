the high mobility group protein hmg-d known bind preferentially dna of
irregular structures little sequence specificity. upon binding dna,
this hmg-box protein widens minor groove double helix induces a
significant bending helix. show hmg-d strongly bind to
double-stranded rna. electrophoretic mobility shift assays show hmg-d100
interacts transactivation response region (tar) rna hiv-1. strong
interaction high affinity rev protein binding element (rbe) rna also
characterized. gel shift experiments performed several tar rna constructs
lacking lateral pyrimidine bulge modified apical loop regions
indicate protein recognize single-strand domains rna
but apparently interacts directly double-stranded stem regions. no
protein-rna complexes could detected using single-stranded
oligoribonucleotides. hmg-d protein could bind wide minor groove the
a-form tar rna. comparison amino acid sequence hmg-d of
known rna binding proteins suggests interaction protein a
double-stranded rna implicates basic region hmg-d well hmg-box
domain. vitro data reported here, propose novel functional role 
for proteins hmg-1 family. results suggest architectural hmg
proteins recruited double-stranded rna development hiv-1 
the host cell.
