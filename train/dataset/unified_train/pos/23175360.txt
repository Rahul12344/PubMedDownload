cervical cancer develops combined activities human
papillomavirus (hpv) e6 e7 oncoproteins. defining characteristic e6
oncoproteins derived cancer-causing hpv types presence pdz
binding motif (pbm) extreme carboxy terminus protein is
absent e6 proteins derived so-called low-risk hpv types. within
this pbm also protein kinase (pka) phospho-acceptor site, thought
to negatively regulate association e6 pdz domain-containing
substrates. show phosphorylation e6 pka and/or akt confers 
the ability interact 14-3-3ζ. interaction direct specific 
the high-risk hpv e6 oncoproteins, although significant differences 
the efficiencies hpv-16, hpv-18, hpv-31 e6 oncoproteins can
associate 14-3-3ζ; correlates directly respective
susceptibilities phosphorylation pka and/or akt. demonstrate that
the interaction e6 14-3-3ζ also requires integrity e6 pbm, and
downregulation 14-3-3ζ results marked reduction levels hpv-18
e6 expression hela cells. using phospho-specific anti-e6 antibodies, also
demonstrate significant levels e6 phosphorylation vivo. studies
redefine potential relevance e6 pbm development cervical
cancer, suggesting interaction 14-3-3ζ, well more
well-established interactions pdz domain-containing substrates, likely to
be responsible biological activities attributed region the
high-risk hpv e6 oncoproteins.
