the trimeric rna polymerase complex (3p, pa-pb1-pb2) influenza virus
(iav) important viral determinant pathogenicity host range
restriction. specific interactions polymerase complex host proteins
may determining factors characteristics play important
roles viral life cycle. investigate question, performed a
comprehensive proteomic analysis human host proteins associated the
polymerase well-characterized h5n1 vietnam/1203/04 isolate. identified 
over 400 proteins liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms),
of 300 found bind pa subunit alone. intriguing
and novel finding large number mitochondrial proteins (âˆ¼20%) that
associated pa subunit. proteins mediate molecular transport across
the mitochondrial membrane regulate membrane potential may concert with
the identified mitochondrion-associated apoptosis inducing factor (aifm1) have
roles induction apoptosis upon association pa. additionally, we
identified host factors associated pa-pb1 (68 proteins) and/or 
3p complex (34 proteins) including proteins roles innate antiviral
signaling (e.g., zaps haxi) cellular rna polymerase accessory factors
(e.g., polymerase transcript release factor [ptrf] supt5h). iav
strain-specific host factor binding polymerase observed our
analysis. overall, study shed light complex contributions of
the iav polymerase host cell pathogenicity allows direct
investigations biological significance newly described
interactions.
