synergism transcriptional activators powerful way potentiating
their function. show glial pou domain protein tst-1 (also known 
as oct-6 scip) large tumor antigen (t antigen) synergistically increased 
transcription early late promoters papovavirus jc in
glial cells. synergism proteins require t-antigen-mediated
dna replication direct binding antigen promoter. ability 
antigen functionally cooperate tst-1 contained within n-terminal 
region, shown fact small tumor antigen (t antigen) could substitute
for antigen transfection experiments. addition functional
synergism, direct interaction tst-1 antigen observed in
vitro. using deletion mutants tst-1 antigen, pou domain tst-1 and
the n-terminal region antigen found participate interaction.
because low levels tst-1 present oligodendrocytes, synergism between
tst-1 antigen could important factor establishing lytic
infection oligodendrocytes jc virus course fatal
demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
