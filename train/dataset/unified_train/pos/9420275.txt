the epstein-barr virus (ebv) ebna2 protein transcriptional activator that
regulates viral cellular gene expression also essential ebv-driven
immortalization b lymphocytes. ebna2-responsive enhancer viral
latency c promoter (cp) binds two cellular factors, cbf1 cbf2. precise
role cbf2 protein cp enhancer function presently unclear. cbf2 does
not appear interact ebna2 binds downstream cbf1 between
positions -339 -368 cp ebna2 enhancer. within region 8-bp
sequence, cagtgcgt, found, similar sequence also located
downstream cbf1 binding sites ebna2-responsive promoters. previous
studies indicated mutations methylation sequence affect
ebna2 responsiveness. investigate requirements cbf2 binding, we
synthesized series oligonucleotides carrying double transversion mutations
spanning conserved core sequence outside flanking sequences.
surprisingly, mutations outside conserved core sequence 4 bases
immediately flanking 5' end, ggtt, deleterious effect cbf2
binding. mutations conserved core gradient effect, near
the 5' end deleterious effects cbf2 binding. addition, 
affinities cbf2 binding lmp-1, lmp-2, cd23 promoters also 
measured. promoters contain conserved core lack 5' flanking
ggtt motif bound cbf2 weakly all. using cp reporter plasmids
containing cbf2 mutant binding sites, also able show lower
doses ebna2, cp transactivation required functional cbf2 binding site but
that higher doses ebna2 transactivated cbf2 mutant promoters 40% of
wild-type levels. assays indicate cbf2 important ebna2-mediated
transactivation viral latency cp. addition, cbf2 activity found 
be associated two polypeptides 27 33 kda.
