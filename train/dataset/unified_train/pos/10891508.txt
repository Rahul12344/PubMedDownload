the epstein-barr virus (ebv) nuclear antigen 3c (ebna3c) essential for
ebv-dependent immortalization human primary b lymphocytes. genetic analysis
indicated amino acids 365 992 important ebv-mediated
immortalization b lymphocytes. demonstrate region ebna3c
critical immortalization interacts prothymosin alpha (protalpha), a
cellular protein previously identified important cell division and
proliferation. interaction maps region downstream amino acid 365
known involved transcription regulation critical ebv-mediated
transformation primary b lymphocytes. additionally, show ebna3c also
interacts p300, cellular acetyltransferase. interaction suggests a
possible role regulation histone acetylation chromatin remodeling. an
increase histone acetylation observed ebv-transformed lymphoblastoid
cell lines, consistent increased cellular gene expression. these
cells express entire repertoire latent nuclear antigens, including ebna3c.
expression ebna3c cells increased acetyltransferase activity mediated 
by ebv transactivator ebna2 results down-modulation activity 
dose-responsive manner. interactions ebna3c protalpha p300
provide new evidence implicating essential ebv protein ebna3c modulating 
the acetylation cellular factors, including histones. hence, ebna3c plays a
critical role balancing cellular transcriptional events linking the
biological property mediating inhibition ebna2 transcription activation and
the observed histone acetyltransferase activity, thereby orchestrating
immortalization ebv-infected cells.
