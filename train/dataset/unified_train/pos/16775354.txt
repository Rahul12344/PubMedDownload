high-risk human papillomaviruses (hpvs) present virtually cervical
carcinomas. however, majority women infected high-risk hpvs not
develop cervical cancer. therefore, cofactors must contribute development 
and progression cervical cancer. although numerous studies implicated
steroid hormones cofactors initiation progression cervical
neoplasia, molecular mechanisms contribute cervical
carcinogenesis currently unknown. observations led us investigate 
newly discovered association high-risk hpv type 16 (hpv16) e7 oncoprotein 
with steroid receptor coactivator 1 (src-1), essential component steroid
hormone signaling. hpv16 e7 previously reported interact p300
and p300/cbp-associated factor (pcaf), members src-1 transcriptional
complexes. demonstrate hpv16 e7 associates vivo vitro with
src-1 independently p300 pcaf. luciferase reporter constructs the
control either interleukin-8 promoter promoter containing
multimerized synthetic estrogen response elements used determine the
effect high- low-risk hpv e7 expression src-1-mediated transcription.
in addition, histone acetyltransferase (hat) assays performed determine
the effect hpv e7 src-1-associated hat activity. experiments reveal
that hpv16 e7 expression down-regulates src-1-mediated transcription and
src-1-associated hat activity. src-1 localization experiments show src-1 
relocalized cytoplasm presence high- low-risk hpv e7
proteins. data suggest hpv e7 proteins dysregulate hormone-dependent
gene expression association relocalization src-1. dysregulation of
src-1 localization function hpv e7 may provide insight molecular 
mechanisms steroid hormones act cofactors induction and
progression cervical neoplasia.
