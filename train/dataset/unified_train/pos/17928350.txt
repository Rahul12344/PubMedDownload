the zaire ebolavirus protein vp24 previously demonstrated inhibit
alpha/beta interferon (ifn-alpha/beta)- ifn-gamma-induced nuclear
accumulation tyrosine-phosphorylated stat1 (py-stat1) inhibit
ifn-alpha/beta- ifn-gamma-induced gene expression. properties
correlated ability vp24 interact nuclear localization
signal receptor py-stat1, karyopherin alpha1. here, vp24 demonstrated to
interact overexpressed also endogenous karyopherin alpha1.
mutational analysis demonstrated vp24 binds within py-stat1 binding
region located c terminus karyopherin alpha1. addition, vp24 was
found inhibit py-stat1 binding overexpressed endogenous
karyopherin alpha1. assessed binding py-stat1 vp24
proteins zaire, mouse-adapted zaire, reston ebola viruses for
interaction six members human karyopherin alpha family. found,
in contrast previous studies, py-stat1 interact with
karyopherin alpha1 also karyopherins alpha5 alpha6, together
comprise npi-1 subfamily karyopherin alphas. similarly, three vp24s
bound inhibited py-stat1 interaction karyopherins alpha1, alpha5, and
alpha6. consistent ability inhibit karyopherin-py-stat1
interaction, zaire, mouse-adapted zaire, reston ebola virus vp24s displayed
similar capacities inhibit ifn-beta-induced gene expression human mouse
cells. findings suggest vp24 inhibits interaction py-stat1 with
karyopherins alpha1, alpha5, alpha6 binding within py-stat1 binding
region karyopherins function conserved among vp24
proteins different ebola virus species.
