bovine leukemia virus (blv) tax essential gene involved the
transcriptional activation viral expression. tax also believed be
implicated leukemogenesis ability immortalize primary cells 
in vitro. gain insight molecular pathways mediating activities of
this important gene, identified cellular proteins interacting tax. by
means two-hybrid approach, show tax specifically interacts with
msx2, general repressor gene expression. gst pull-down experiments and
co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed binding specificity. furthermore,
the n-terminal residues 1-79 msx2 required binding, whereas the
c-terminal residues 201-267 msx2 play critical role. whereas the
oncogenic potential tax primary cells slightly affected by
overexpression msx2, function tax, namely ltr-dependent
transcriptional activation, inhibited msx2 human hela bovine
b-lymphoblastoid (bl3) cell lines. msx2 repression function be
counteracted overexpression transcription factors creb2 rap74. the
tax/msx2 interplay thus results repression viral transcriptional activation
possibly acting regulatory feedback loop. importantly, viral gene
silencing strictly associated concomitant loss tax oncogenicity 
as measured ability immortalize primary cells. interestingly, msx2 
also interacts inhibits transactivation function related tax1
protein encoded human t-cell leukemia virus type 1 (htlv-1).
