a natural hepatitis b virus (hbv) variant associated seroconversion from
hbeag anti-hbe antibody contains two nucleotide substitutions (a1764t and
g1766a) proximal nuclear hormone receptor binding site nucleocapsid
promoter. nucleotide substitutions prevent binding retinoid x
receptor alpha (rxr alpha)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (ppar
alpha) heterodimer without greatly altering efficiency binding of
hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (hnf4) recognition sequence. addition,
these nucleotide substitutions create new binding site hnf1. analysis of
hbv transcription replication nonhepatoma cells indicates rxr
alpha-ppar alpha heterodimers support higher levels pregenomic rna
transcription wild-type variant nucleocapsid promoter,
producing higher levels wild-type variant replication intermediates.
in contrast, hnf4 supports higher levels pregenomic rna transcription the
variant wild-type nucleocapsid promoter, producing higher levels of
variant wild-type replication intermediates. hnf1 support variant
virus replication low level unable support replication the
wild-type hbv genome. observations indicate replication of
wild-type variant viruses differentially regulated the
liver-specific transcription factors bind proximal nuclear hormone
receptor binding site nucleocapsid promoter. differential regulation of
viral replication may important selection specific viral variants as
a result antiviral immune response.
