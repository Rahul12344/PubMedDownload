one step process herpes simplex virus (hsv) entry cells the
binding viral glycoprotein (gd) cellular receptor. human nectin-2 (also
known hveb prr2), member immunoglobulin (ig) superfamily, serves 
as gd receptor entry hsv-2, variant forms hsv-1 amino
acid substitutions position 25 27 gd (for example, hsv-1/rid), and
porcine pseudorabies virus (prv). gd binding region nectin-2 believed
to localized n-terminal variable-like (v) ig domain. order to
identify specific amino acid sequences nectin-2 important hsv
entry activity, chimeric molecules constructed exchange sequences
between human nectin-2 mouse homolog, mouse nectin-2, mediates
entry prv hsv-1 hsv-2. nectin-2 chimeric molecules were
expressed chinese hamster ovary cells, normally lack gd receptor, 
tested cell surface expression viral entry activity. expected,
chimeric molecules containing v domain human nectin-2 exhibited hsv entry 
activity. replacement either two small regions v domain mouse
nectin-2 amino acids equivalent positions human nectin-2 (amino 
acids 75 81 89) transferred hsv-1/rid entry activity mouse nectin-2. the
resulting chimeras also exhibited enhanced hsv-2 entry activity gained the
ability mediate wild-type hsv-1 entry. replacement amino acid 89 human
nectin-2 corresponding mouse amino acid (m89f) eliminated hsv entry
activity. results identify two different amino acid sequences, predicted to
lie adjacent c' c" beta-strands v domain, critical for
hsv entry activity. region homologous human immunodeficiency virus
binding region cd4 poliovirus binding region cd155.
