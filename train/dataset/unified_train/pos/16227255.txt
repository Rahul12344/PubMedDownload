nasopharyngeal carcinomas (npc) etiologically related epstein-barr
virus (ebv), malignant npc cells consistent although heterogeneous
expression ebv latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1). lmp1 trafficking and
signaling require incorporation membrane rafts. conversely, raft
environment likely modulate lmp1 activity. order investigate
npc-specific raft partners lmp1, rafts derived c15 npc xenograft were
submitted preparative immunoprecipitation lmp1 combined mass
spectrometry analysis coimmunoprecipitated proteins. procedure,
galectin 9, beta-galactoside binding lectin hodgkin tumor antigen, was
identified novel lmp1 partner. lmp1 interaction galectin 9 was
confirmed coimmunoprecipitation western blotting whole-cell extracts of
npc ebv-transformed b cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines [lcls]). using mutant 
proteins expressed hela cells, lmp1 shown bind galectin 9 a
traf3-independent manner. galectin 9 abundant npc biopsies well in
lcls, whereas absent burkitt lymphoma cells. subsequent experiments, 
npc cells treated simvastatin, drug reported dissociate lmp1 
membrane rafts ebv-transformed b cells. found significant effects of
simvastatin distribution lmp1 galectin 9 npc cell rafts.
however, simvastatin highly cytotoxic npc cells, regardless the
presence absence lmp1. suggests simvastatin potentially
useful agent treatment npcs although distinct mechanisms of
action npc lcl cells.
