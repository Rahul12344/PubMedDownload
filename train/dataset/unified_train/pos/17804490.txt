hepatitis c virus (hcv) global challenge public health. several factors
have proven critical hcv entry, including newly identified
claudin-1 (cldn1). however, mechanism hcv entry still obscure.
presently, among 20 members claudin family identified humans so
far, cldn1 member shown necessary hcv entry.
recently, discovered bel7402, hcv-permissive cell line, not
express cldn1 expresses members claudin family. among these
claudins, cldn9 able mediate hcv entry efficiently cldn1. we
then examined members claudin family could mediate entry. show
that cldn6 cldn9, cldn2, cldn3, cldn4, cldn7, cldn11, cldn12, cldn15,
cldn17, cldn23, able mediate entry hcv target cells. we
found cldn6 cldn9 expressed liver, primary site hcv
replication. also showed cldn6 cldn9, cldn1, expressed in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, additional site hcv replication.
through sequence comparison mutagenesis studies, show residues n38
and v45 first extracellular loop (el1) cldn9 necessary hcv
entry.
