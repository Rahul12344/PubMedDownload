avian influenza viruses belong genus influenza virus family
orthomyxoviridae. influenza virus consists eight segmented minus stranded 
rna encode 11 known proteins. among 11 viral proteins, ns1
(non-structural protein 1, encoded segment 8) implicated the
regulation several important intra-cellular functions. report, we
investigated functional interaction ns1 serine threonine kinase akt, 
a core intra-cellular survival regulator. co-immunoprecipitation assays and
gst pull-down assays, ns1 directly interacted akt. interaction was
mediated primarily akt-ph (pleckstrin homology) domain the
rna-binding domain ns1. ns1 preferentially interacted phosphorylated akt,
but non-phosphorylated akt. functionally, ns1-akt interaction
enhanced akt activity intra-cellular context vitro akt
kinase assays. confocal microscopic analysis revealed phosphorylated akt
interacted ns1 interphase cell cycle predominantly within 
the nucleus. finally, mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated position at
thr215 ns1 protein primary phosphorylation target site akt
activation. results together supported functional importance influenza
virus ns1 akt, core intra-cellular survival regulator.
