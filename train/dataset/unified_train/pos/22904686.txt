the tumor necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor 2 (traf2)- and
nck-interacting kinase (tnik) ubiquitously expressed member germinal 
center kinase family. tnik functions hematopoietic cells role of
tnik-traf interaction remain largely unknown. functional proteomics we
identified tnik interaction partner latent membrane protein 1 (lmp1)
signalosome primary human b-cells infected epstein-barr tumor virus
(ebv). rnai-mediated knockdown proved critical role tnik canonical nf-κb
and c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) activation major ebv oncoprotein lmp1
and cellular counterpart, b-cell co-stimulatory receptor cd40.
accordingly, tnik mandatory proliferation survival ebv-transformed 
b-cells. tnik forms activation-induced complex critical signaling
mediators traf6, tak1/tab2, ikkβ, mediates signalosome formation lmp1.
tnik directly binds traf6, bridges tnik's interaction c-terminus
of lmp1. separate tnik domains involved nf-κb jnk signaling, the
n-terminal tnik kinase domain essential ikkβ/nf-κb c-terminus
for jnk activation. therefore suggest tnik orchestrates bifurcation
of pathways level traf6-tak1/tab2-ikk complex. data
establish tnik novel key player traf6-dependent jnk nf-κb signaling
and transducer activating transforming signals human b-cells.
