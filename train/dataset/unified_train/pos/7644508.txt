the herpes simplex virus 1 (hsv-1) genome encodes seven polypeptides are
required replication. include heterodimeric dna polymerase, a
single-strand-dna-binding protein, heterotrimeric helicase/primase, a
protein (ul9 protein) binds specifically hsv-1 origin replication
(oris). demonstrate ul9 protein interacts specifically the
180-kda catalytic subunit cellular dna polymerase alpha-primase. this
interaction detected immunoprecipitation antibodies directed
against either proteins, gel mobility shift oris-ul9 protein
complex, stimulation dna polymerase activity ul9 protein. 
findings suggest enzymes required cellular dna replication also
participate hsv-1 dna replication.
