the 5'-terminal sequence hepatitis c virus (hcv) positive-strand rna
genome essential viral replication. critical host factors, including a
mir-122/ago2 complex poly(rc)-binding protein 2 (pcbp2), associate 
rna segment. used biotinylated rna pulldown approach isolate host factors
binding hcv 5' terminal 47 nucleotides and, addition ago2 pcbp2,
identified several novel proteins, including igf2bp1, hnrnp l, dhx9, adar1, and
nf90 (ilf3). pcbp2, igf2bp1, hnrnp l bound single-stranded rna, dhx9,
adar1, nf90 bound cognate double-stranded rna bait. pcbp2, igf2bp1, and
hnrnp l binding blocked preannealing single-stranded rna bait with
mir-122, indicating bind rna competition mir-122. however, 
igf2bp1 binding also inhibited high concentrations heparin, suggesting 
that bound bait nonspecifically. among proteins, small interfering
rna-mediated depletion hnrnp l nf90 significantly impaired viral
replication reduced infectious virus yields without substantially affecting
hcv internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation. hnrnp l nf90 were
found associate hcv rna infected cells coimmunoprecipitate with
ns5a rna-dependent manner. also associate detergent-resistant
membranes viral replication complexes reside. conclude hnrnp and
nf90 important host factors hcv replication, least cultured cells, 
and may present replication complex.importance: although hcv
replication intensively studied many laboratories, many aspects of
the viral life cycle remain obscure. here, use novel rna pulldown strategy
coupled mass spectrometry identify host cell proteins interact
functionally regulatory rna elements located extreme 5' end the
positive-strand rna genome. identify two, primarily nuclear rna-binding
proteins, hnrnp l nf90, previously unrecognized proviral roles hcv
replication. data presented add current understanding replication
