nef accessory protein pathogenicity factor human immunodeficiency
virus (hiv) simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) elevates virus
replication vivo. recently described hiv type 1(sf2) (hiv-1(sf2)) the
potent interference nef t-lymphocyte chemotaxis via association 
the cellular kinase pak2. mechanistic analysis revealed interaction
results deregulation actin-severing factor cofilin thus blocks 
chemokine-mediated actin remodeling required cell motility. however, the
efficiency pak2 association highly variable among nef proteins from
different lentiviruses, prompting us evaluate conservation this
actin-remodeling/cofilin-deregulating mechanism. based analysis total
of 17 hiv-1, hiv-2, siv nef proteins, report inhibition of
chemokine-induced actin remodeling well inactivation cofilin are
strongly conserved activities lentiviral nef proteins. note, even nef
variants display marginal pak2 association vitro, activities
require integrity pak2 recruitment motif presence endogenous 
pak2. thus, reduced vitro affinity pak2 indicate limited
functionality nef-pak2 complexes intact hiv-1 host cells. results
establish hijacking pak2 deregulation cofilin inhibition of
triggered actin remodeling highly conserved function lentiviral nef
proteins, supporting notion pak2 association may critical nef's
activity vivo.
