hepatitis b virus-encoded x antigen contributes development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. given x antigen functions binding other
proteins, additional x-binding proteins sought adult human liver
cdna library yeast two-hybrid system. results yielded clone encoding a
55-kd protein associated replicative senescence (p55sen). binding of
p55sen x antigen confirmed vitro immunoprecipitation affinity
chromatography. expression endogenous p55sen inversely correlated with
cell growth. transient transfection x antigen p55sen hepg2 cells
stimulated dna synthesis twofold threefold, whereas cotransfection not,
suggesting molecules functionally interact. detection p55sen in
embryonic mouse liver, absence adult mouse human livers, its
reappearance livers carriers chronic liver disease, suggest 
may play important roles regulation liver cell growth. similarity
between p55sen notch ligand, involved cell fate determinations 
during embryogenesis, implies binding p55sen x antigen may also
contribute alteration cell fate, characteristic of
carcinogenesis.
