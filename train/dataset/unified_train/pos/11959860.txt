human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) gene expression replication is
highly dependent modulated interactions viral host cellular
factors. tat protein, encoded one hiv-1 regulatory genes, tat, is
essential hiv-1 gene expression. number host cellular factors 
shown interact tat process. attempts determine 
molecular mechanisms tat interaction brain cells, isolated cdna
clone encodes novel tat-interacting protein 110 kda tip110 a
human fetal brain cdna library. genbank blast search revealed tip110 was
almost identical previously cloned kiaa0156 gene unknown functions. 
vivo binding tip110 tat confirmed immunoprecipitation western 
blotting, combination mutagenesis. yeast three-hybrid rna-protein
interaction assay indicated direct interaction tip110 tat
transactivating response element rna. nevertheless, tip110 strongly synergized
with tat tat-mediated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene
expression hiv-1 virus production, whereas down-modulation constitutive
tip110 expression inhibited hiv-1 virus production. northern blot analysis showed
that tip110 mrna expressed variety human tissues cells. moreover,
digital fluorescence microscopic imaging revealed tip110 expressed
exclusively nucleus, within nuclear speckle structure has
recently described human cyclin cdk9, two critical components 
tat transactivation function hiv-1 long terminal repeat promoter. taken
together, data demonstrate tip110 regulates tat transactivation
activity direct interaction, suggest tip110 important
cellular factor hiv-1 gene expression viral replication.
