phosphorylation hepadnavirus core protein c-terminal domain (ctd) is
important viral rna packaging, reverse transcription, subcellular
localization. hepadnavirus capsids also package cellular kinase. identity
of host kinase phosphorylates core ctd gets packaged remains to
be resolved. particular, human hepatitis b virus (hbv) duck
hepatitis b virus (dhbv) core ctds harbor several conserved
serine/threonine-proline (s/t-p) sites whose phosphorylation state known to
regulate ctd functions. report endogenous kinase hbv
capsids blocked chemical inhibitors cyclin-dependent kinases
(cdks), particular, cdk2 inhibitors. kinase phosphorylated hbv ctd 
the serine-proline (s-p) sites. furthermore, able detect cdk2 in
purified hbv capsids immunoblotting. purified cdk2 phosphorylated s/t-p
sites hbv dhbv ctd vitro. inhibitors cdks, cdk2 in
particular, decreased hbv dhbv ctd phosphorylation vivo. moreover,
cdk2 inhibitors blocked dhbv ctd phosphorylation, specifically s/t-p
sites, mammalian cell lysate. results indicate cellular cdk2
phosphorylates functionally critical s/t-p sites hepadnavirus core ctd
and incorporated viral capsids.
