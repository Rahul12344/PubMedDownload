apoptin, chicken anemia virus-encoded protein, induces apoptosis human tumor
cells normal cells. tumor-specific activity apoptin is
correlated nuclear localization tumor cells. attempt to
elucidate molecular mechanism apoptin-induced apoptosis, identified
human hippi, protein interactor apoptosis co-mediator huntingtin
interacting protein 1, one apoptin-associated proteins yeast
two-hybrid screen. also demonstrated hippi could interact apoptin
both vitro human cells. furthermore, subcellular localization studies
showed hippi apoptin perfectly colocalized cytoplasm normal
human hel cells, whereas cancerous hela cells apoptin hippi were
located separately nucleus cytoplasm and, thus, showed modest
colocalization. mapping studies indicate hippi binds within the
self-multimerization domain apoptin, apoptin binds c-terminal half 
of hippi, including death effector domain-like motif. results suggest
that apoptin-hippi interaction may play role suppression of
apoptosis normal cells.
