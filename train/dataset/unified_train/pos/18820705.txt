a unique feature cancer-causing mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (hpvs)
is ability e6 proteins interact number pdz
domain-containing cellular substrates, including cell polarity regulators
hdlg hscrib. interactions essential ability these
viruses induce malignant progression. rhesus papillomaviruses (rhpv) are
similar human counterparts also cause anogenital malignancy
in host, rhesus macaque. however, unlike hpv e6, rhpv e6 no
pdz-binding motif. show motif present rhpv e7
oncoprotein. motif specifically confers pdz-binding activity directs the
interaction rhpv e7 cell polarity regulator par3, targets
for proteasome-mediated degradation. results demonstrate amazing
evolutionary conservation function rhpv hpv oncoproteins, 
where target proteins cell polarity control network, although
through different components pathways.
