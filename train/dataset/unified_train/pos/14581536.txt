epstein-barr virus orip confers cell cycle-dependent dna replication stable
maintenance plasmids ebna1-positive cells. dyad symmetry region orip
contains four ebna1 binding sites punctuated 9-bp repeats referred to
as nonamers. previous work shown nonamers bind cellular factors
associated human telomeres contribute episomal maintenance orip.
in work, show substitution mutation three nonamer sites
reduces dna replication plasmid maintenance orip-containing plasmids 
by 2.5- 5-fold. nonamers required high-affinity binding trf1, 
trf2, hrap1 dyad symmetry element essential the
binding ebna1 determined dna affinity purification nuclear
extracts. chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated trf1, trf2, and
hrap1 bound orip vivo. cell cycle studies indicate trf2 binding orip
peaks g(1)/s trf1 binding peaks g(2)/m. orip replication was
inhibited transfection full-length trf1 deletion mutants lacking
the myb dna binding domain. contrast, orip replication affected by
transfection full-length trf2 hrap1 potently inhibited by
dominant-negative trf2 hrap1 amino-terminal truncation mutants. knockdown
experiments short interfering rnas (sirnas) directed trf2 hrap1 
severely reduced orip replication, trf1 sirna modest stimulatory
effect orip replication. results indicate trf2 hrap1 promote,
while trf1 antagonizes, orip-dependent dna replication suggest these
telomeric factors contribute establishment replication competence at
orip.
