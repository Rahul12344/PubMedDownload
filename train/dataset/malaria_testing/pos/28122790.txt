Proinflammatory cytokines are involved in clearance of Plasmodium falciparum, and
very high levels of these cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
severe malaria. In order to determine how cytokines vary with disease severity
and syndrome, we enrolled Malawian children presenting with cerebral malaria
(CM), severe malarial anemia (SMA), and uncomplicated malaria (UCM) and healthy
controls. We analyzed serum cytokine concentrations in acute infection and in
convalescence. With the exception of interleukin 5 (IL-5), cytokine
concentrations were highest in acute CM, followed by SMA, and were only mildly
elevated in UCM. Cytokine concentrations had fallen to control levels when
remeasured at 1 month of convalescence in all three clinical malaria groups.
Ratios of IL-10 to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and of IL-10 to IL-6
followed a similar pattern. Children presenting with acute CM had significantly
higher concentrations of TNF-α (P < 0.001), interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (P =
0.0019), IL-2 (P = 0.0004), IL-6 (P < 0.001), IL-8 (P < 0.001), and IL-10 (P <
0.001) in sera than healthy controls. Patients with acute CM had significantly
higher concentrations of IL-6 (P < 0.001) and IL-10 (P = 0.0003) than those
presenting with acute SMA. Our findings are consistent with the concept that high
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, despite high levels of the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10, could contribute to the pathogenesis of CM.
