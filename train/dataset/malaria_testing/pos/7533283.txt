Bovine macrophage-derived tumour necrosis factor-alpha/cachectin (TNF-alpha) was 
synthesized when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and purified adherent 
PBMC from naive and Theileria annulata-infected cattle were incubated in vitro
with concanavalin A (Con-A) or bovine recombinant interferon gamma (Bo
rIFN-gamma). TNF-alpha production was also induced when adherent PBMC were
cultured with T. annulata macroschizont-infected cells. In contrast, non-adherent
PBMC from sublethally infected cattle produced interferon (IFN) when incubated
with Hu rIL-2, Con-A, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or T. annulata
macroschizont-infected cells growing as cell lines in vitro. Whilst PBMC from
lethally infected cattle spontaneously produced IFN-gamma during advanced stages 
of infection, the sera of such animals contained type 1 IFN (alpha/beta). IFN was
also produced by T. annulata macroschizont-infected cell lines maintained in
vitro. This work suggests that cytokines serve as crucial links between
proliferating Theileira-infected cells and the characteristic clinical symptoms
of tropical theileriosis.
