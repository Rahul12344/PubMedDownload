Senicapoc, a Gardos channel inhibitor, prevented erythrocyte dehydration in
clinical trials of patients with sickle cell disease. We tested the hypothesis
that senicapoc-induced blockade of the Gardos channel inhibits Plasmodium growth.
Senicapoc inhibited in vitro growth of human and primate plasmodia during the
clinical blood stage. Senicapoc treatment suppressed P. yoelii parasitemia in
vivo in C57BL/6 mice. The reassuring safety and biochemical profile of senicapoc 
encourage its use in antimalarial development.
