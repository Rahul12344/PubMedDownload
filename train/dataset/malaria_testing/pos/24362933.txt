Before they infect red blood cells and cause malaria, Plasmodium parasites
undergo an obligate and clinically silent expansion phase in the liver that is
supposedly undetected by the host. Here, we demonstrate the engagement of a type 
I interferon (IFN) response during Plasmodium replication in the liver. We
identified Plasmodium RNA as a previously unrecognized pathogen-associated
molecular pattern (PAMP) capable of activating a type I IFN response via the
cytosolic pattern recognition receptor Mda5. This response, initiated by
liver-resident cells through the adaptor molecule for cytosolic RNA sensors,
Mavs, and the transcription factors Irf3 and Irf7, is propagated by hepatocytes
in an interferon-α/β receptor-dependent manner. This signaling pathway is
critical for immune cell-mediated host resistance to liver-stage Plasmodium
infection, which we find can be primed with other PAMPs, including hepatitis C
virus RNA. Together, our results show that the liver has sensor mechanisms for
Plasmodium that mediate a functional antiparasite response driven by type I IFN.
