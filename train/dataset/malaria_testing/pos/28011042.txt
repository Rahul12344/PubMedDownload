Ischaemic neuropathological changes associated with Cytauxzoon felis infection in
cats have been reported recently. This paper describes the associated glial
changes and the evidence for apoptosis in the brain of cats infected naturally by
C. felis. Sections of brain from eight affected cats and eight age- and
sex-matched control cats were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for expression of
glial fibrillary acidic protein, CD18 and cleaved caspase-3. Vascular changes in 
the leptomeninges and parenchyma, the number of positive astrocytes and
phagocytic cells (microglia or macrophages) and the average astrocytic
cytoplasmic area and number and length of astrocytic processes were quantified,
and a mean value for the grey and white matter in both groups was generated.
Astrocytic hyperplasia (astrogliosis) and phagocytic cell hyperplasia were
detected in all affected cats. Immunoexpression of cleaved caspase-3 was detected
in intravascular and perivascular macrophages in the leptomeninges and, less
often, in the grey and white matter in all affected cats. Four cats with
encephalomalacia had additional cytoplasmic immunolabelling of phagocytic cells
around the necrotic foci and macrophages and cell debris within the areas of
necrosis. These results support the role of an extensive reaction of the brain
tissue to hypoxia-ischaemia and a potential role of apoptosis in the
neuropathogenesis of C. felis infection in cats.
