[Changes in the activity of serum enzymes, total protein and electrolytes in
experimental babeiasis in sheep].

[Article in Bulgarian]

Khalacheva M, Brubcheva V.

Investigations were carried out on the serum enzymes, total proteins and some
electrolites (potassium and sodium) in eight spleenectomized sheep experimentally
infected with Babesia organisms. It was found that babesiasis in sheep was
accompanied by a considerable rise in the activity of GOT and GPT (from 80JU up
to 260IU and from 4 IU up to 19 IU). The amount of inorganic phosphorus dropped, 
and that of potassium sodium and alkaline phosphatase showed no changes. It is
believed that the changes in the activity of GOT, GPT and inorganic phosphorus
depend on the gravity and the duration of the disease and can be used as a
criterion in determining the pathologic process.
