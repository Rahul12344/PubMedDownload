Graphical representation of neuromuscular function in spinal cord injury.

Moffet CL, Spencer WA.

Accurate determination of the location and extent of a spinal cord leson is
essential to the ongoing therapeutic plans for a patient as well as for overall
program evaluation in a spinal cord center. The interpretation of muscle function
tests performed for this purpose is often complex due to the large number of
muscles innervated in part by a single segment of the cord and the overlapping
pattern of innervation. The aggregation of the individual muscle ratings by
spinal cord root segment and graphic presentation of this information provides a 
convenient means to gain an overview of muscle function and follow changes in the
cord lesion over time through serial test results. Two cases demonstrate some of 
the graphic patterns that result from complete and incomplete lesions from
shortly after injury with both receding and advancing involvement of the cord
demonstrated.
