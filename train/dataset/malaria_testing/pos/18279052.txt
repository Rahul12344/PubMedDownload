BACKGROUND: Placental malaria causes fetal growth retardation (FGR), which has
been linked epidemiologically to placental monocyte infiltrates. We investigated 
whether parasite or monocyte infiltrates were associated with placental hypoxia, 
as a potential mechanism underlying malarial FGR.
METHODS: We studied the hypoxia markers hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor, VEGF receptor
1 and its soluble form, and VEGF receptor 2. We used real-time polymerase chain
reaction (in 59 women) to examine gene transcription, immunohistochemistry (in 30
women) to describe protein expression, and laser-capture microdissection (in 23
women) to examine syncytiotrophoblast-specific changes in gene expression. We
compared gene and protein expression in relation to malaria infection, monocyte
infiltrates, and birth weight.
RESULTS: We could not associate any hallmark of placental malaria with a
transcription, expression, or tissue-distribution profile characteristic of a
response to hypoxia, but we found higher HIF-1alpha levels (P= .0005) and lower
VEGF levels (P= .0026) in the syncytiotrophoblasts of cases of malaria than in
those of asymptomatic control placentas.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data are inconsistent with a role for placental hypoxia in the
pathogenesis of malaria-associated FGR. The laser-capture microdissection study
was small, but its results suggest (1) that malaria affects
syncytiotrophoblast-gene transcription and (2) novel potential mechanisms for
placental malaria-associated FGR.
