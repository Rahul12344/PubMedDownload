The serum acid phosphatase (ACP) activity and Hemoglobin (Hb) levels were
measured in malaria patients and nonmalarial fever patients. The results were
compared with normal healthy control subjects. ACP was significantly increased
(P < 0.001) in all the malaria patients. ACP was significantly higher in
Plasmodium falcifarum malaria and mixed malaria when compared to Plasmodium vivax
malaria. Hb levels were significantly decreased in all the malaria patients which
indicates that malaria parasite uses host erythrocyte Hb as a major nutrient
source. There is negative correlation(r = -0.478) between ACP and Hb in malaria
patients, which is highly significant. These results suggest that the measurement
of ACP could be used as a marker for malaria.ELECTRONIC SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL:
