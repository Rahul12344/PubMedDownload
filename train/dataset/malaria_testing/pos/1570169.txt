Cytokines inhibit the development of trophozoite-infected cells of Theileria
annulata and Theileria parva but enhance the proliferation of
macroschizont-infected cell lines.

The following bovine (Bo) and human (Hu) cytokines--Bo rTNF-a, Bo rIFN-g, Hu
IFN-a, Hu rIL-1, Hu rIL-2--significantly inhibited the in vitro development of
trophozoite-infected cells of three stocks of Theileria annulata and of Theileria
parva (Muguga). However, none of these cytokines inhibited the proliferation of
established T. annulata or T. parva macroschizont-infected cell lines. Indeed, Bo
rTNF-a and Hu rIL-2 consistently enhanced the proliferation of
macroschizont-infected cell lines of both species and the blastogenesis of
uninfected lymphocytes in trophozoite-infected cultures. These results suggest
that cytokines could help in resistance to challenge infections by preventing the
further development of trophozoite-infected cells but provide no evidence that
any of the above cytokines directly help to resolve primary infections by
inhibiting the growth of macroschizont-infected cells. These findings also
suggest that both TNF-a and IL-2 could play a role in the pathogenesis of
Theileria infections by promoting the proliferation of macroschizont-infected
cells and the associated lymphoid hyperplasia.
