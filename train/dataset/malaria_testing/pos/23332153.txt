Following intracellular replication, the apicomplexan parasites Plasmodium
falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii cause host cell cytolysis to facilitate parasite
release and disease progression. Parasite exit from infected cells requires the
interplay of parasite-derived proteins and host actin cytoskeletal changes;
however, the host proteins underlying these changes remain obscure. We report the
identification of a Gα(q)-coupled host-signaling cascade required for the egress 
of both P. falciparum and T. gondii. Gα(q)-coupled signaling results in protein
kinase C (PKC)-mediated loss of the host cytoskeletal protein adducin and
weakening of the cellular cytoskeleton. This cytoskeletal compromise induces
catastrophic Ca(2+) influx mediated by the mechanosensitive cation channel TRPC6,
which activates host calpain that proteolyzes the host cytoskeleton allowing
parasite release. Reinforcing the feasibility of targeting host proteins as an
antiparasitic strategy, mammalian PKC inhibitors demonstrated activity in murine 
models of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Importantly, an orally bioavailable PKC
inhibitor prolonged survival in an experimental cerebral malaria model.
