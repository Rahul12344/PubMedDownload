BACKGROUND: Molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of severe
Plasmodium falciparum malaria (SM), are not yet fully understood. Both
endothelin-1 (ET-1) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) are produced by vascular
endothelium and act locally as paracrine regulators of vascular tone, ET-1 being 
a potent vasoconstrictor and CNP having strong vasorelaxant properties.
METHODS: Plasma levels of ET-1 and N-terminal fragments of CNP (NT-proCNP) were
studied on admission and after 24 hours of treatment, using
enzyme-linked-immunosorbent-assay (ELISA) technique, in Gabonese children with
severe falciparum malaria (SM, n = 50), with uncomplicated malaria (UM, n = 39)
and healthy controls (HC, n = 25).
RESULTS: Compared to HC, malaria patients had significantly higher plasma levels 
of ET-1 and significantly lower levels of NT-proCNP (p < 0.001 and p < 0.024
respectively). Plasma levels of NT-proCNP were additionally decreased in SM
patients compared to HC (p = 0.034), whereas UM was not significantly different
to HC. In the SM group we found a trend towards lower ET-1 levels compared to UM 
(p = 0.085).
CONCLUSION: In the present study, an imbalance between the vasoconstricitve and
vasorelaxant endothelium-derived substances ET-1 and CNP in the plasma of
children with falciparum malaria is demonstrated, presumably in favor of
vasoconstrictive and pro-inflammatory effects. These results may indicate
involvement of ET-1 and CNP in malaria pathogenesis. Furthermore, results of
lower ET-1 and CNP levels in SM may reflect endothelial cell damage.
