Several CD4+ T cell subtypes contribute to immune homeostasis in malaria, but the
markers that define the main suppressive T cell subsets induced by this infection
remain largely unknown. Here we provide a detailed phenotypic characterization of
immunoregulatory CD4+ T cell populations in uncomplicated human malaria. We found
an increased proportion of CD4+ T cells expressing CTLA-4, OX40, GITR, TNFRII,
and CD69 in acute-phase single-species infections with Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium falciparum, or both. Such an increase was not proportional to parasite
density in P. vivax infections, and did not persist after parasite clearance.
Significantly, less than 10% of CD4+ T cells expressing these regulatory
molecules had the classical T regulatory (Treg) phenotype
(CD4+CD25+CD127-FoxP3+). Two major Treg cell subpopulations, which together
accounted for 19-23% of all Treg cells circulating in malaria patients, expressed
surface receptors with opposing regulatory functions, either CTLA-4 or OX40.
OX40+ Treg cells outnumbered their CTLA-4+ counterparts (1.8:1) during acute P.
vivax infection, while a more balanced ratio (1.3:1) was observed following
parasite clearance These data reveal new players in the complex CD4+ Treg cell
network that maintains immune homeostasis in malaria and suggest potential
targets for therapeutic interventions to improve parasite-specific effector
immune responses.
