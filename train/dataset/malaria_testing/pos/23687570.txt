BACKGROUND: Endothelial activation may contribute to development of severe
disease from Plasmodium falciparum infection, but optimal markers of endothelial 
activation in severe malaria, the extent of endothelial activation in
asymptomatic infection, and the effect of blood group O on endothelial activation
have not been defined.
METHODS: Serum levels of 3 markers of endothelial activation-von Willebrand
factor (VWF), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), and soluble
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1)-were assessed in Ugandan children
with cerebral malaria (CM) (n = 86), children with uncomplicated malaria (UM)
(n = 81), and community children (CC) (n = 90).
RESULTS: Serum VWF, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 levels were all elevated in asymptomatic
community children with microscopy-confirmed parasitemia when compared with
children without parasitemia by microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (all,
P ≤ .05). Levels of VWF, sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1 were higher in children with UM
than in CC (all, P < 0.001), but only VWF levels effectively distinguished CM
from UM (P < 0.001), a finding confirmed by receiver operating characteristic
analyses (area under the curve = 0.67; 95% confidence interval, .58-.75). Von
Willebrand factor levels were lower in children with blood group O versus non-O
blood groups across the disease spectrum, but VWF levels remained higher in CM
versus UM, even after controlling for blood group.
CONCLUSIONS: Endothelial activation, as assessed by serum levels of VWF, sICAM-1,
and sVCAM-1, occurs even in subclinical P. falciparum parasitemia. Von Willebrand
factor levels increase with greater malaria disease severity. Blood group O is
associated with lower VWF levels, but presence of blood group O alone does not
explain the higher VWF levels seen in children with CM.
