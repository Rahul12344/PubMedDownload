We identify an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-induced I23N mutation in the THEMIS
protein that causes protection against experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused
by infection with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Themis(I23N) homozygous mice show
reduced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte numbers. ECM resistance in P. berghei
ANKA-infected Themis(I23N) mice is associated with decreased cerebral cellular
infiltration, retention of blood-brain barrier integrity, and reduced
proinflammatory cytokine production. THEMIS(I23N) protein expression is absent
from mutant mice, concurrent with the decreased THEMIS(I23N) stability observed
in vitro. Biochemical studies in vitro and functional complementation in vivo in 
Themis(I23N/+):Lck(-/+) doubly heterozygous mice demonstrate that functional
coupling of THEMIS to LCK tyrosine kinase is required for ECM pathogenesis.
Damping of proinflammatory responses in Themis(I23N) mice causes susceptibility
to pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus, THEMIS is required for the development and
ultimately the function of proinflammatory T cells. Themis(I23N) mice can be used
to study the newly discovered association of THEMIS (6p22.33) with inflammatory
bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.
