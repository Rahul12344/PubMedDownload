Ceramide is a lipid second messenger which is generated in response to
stimulation of a number of surface receptors, treatment with chemotherapeutic
agents, or ionising radiation. Depending on the target cell, ceramide induces
diverse biological responses including apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest,
differentiation, and also proliferation. We studied the effect of ceramide on the
degradation of IkappaB, the cytoplasmic inhibitor of the transcription factor
NF-kappaB. We show that ceramide treatment results in reduced levels of
phosphorylated IkappaBalpha and degradation of both IkappaBalpha and IkappaBbeta.
Ceramide synergised with okadaic acid (OA), a compound which interferes with the 
protein phosphatase 2A-controlled component of the NF-kappaB activation pathway, 
enhancing OA-induced IkappaB degradation. Ceramide also synergised with phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate, which mimics protein kinase C activation. Finally, we
show that the synergistic effect of ceramide with OA or phorbol ester can be
observed in primary lymph node T-cells as well as in transformed T-cells.
