The past 10 years have generated new insights into the complex interaction
between CD36 (cluster of differentiation 36) and malaria. These range from the
crystallization of the CD36 homolog, LIMPII (lysosomal integral membrane protein 
II), permitting modeling of CD36 and its binding to diverse ligands, to cell
biology-based studies of CD36 and large population genetic studies assessing the 
association of CD36 polymorphisms and malarial disease severity. Collectively
these lines of evidence indicate that a receptor other than CD36 is associated
with severity. CD36 plays an important role in innate immunity and in the
phagocytic uptake of multiple pathogens including malaria. CD36 polymorphisms
lack association with severity, and isolates that cause severe disease primarily 
bind to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) rather than to CD36.
