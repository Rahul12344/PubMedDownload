There is a strong innate immunity in calves to infection with Babesia bovis.
Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 have been shown in vitro to be important
immunoregulatory cytokines. Here we demonstrate in vivo that the protective
innate response in young calves to infection with virulent B. bovis involves the 
early appearance of IL-12 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) transcripts in the
spleen. In contrast, IL-12 and IFN-gamma mRNA expression in the spleens of adult 
cattle that succumbed to the infection was delayed and depressed and occurred
within the context of IL-10 expression. Also in contrast with calves, there was
no detectable antibody response before death in adults. A vigorous CD8+ T-cell
expansion occurred in the spleens of both calves and adults.
