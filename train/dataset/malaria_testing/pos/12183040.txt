The levels of apoptosis associated proteins Bcl(2), Bax, cytochrome-c and p53 was
investigated in mice cerebral cortex and cerebellum, using an experimental model 
of fatal murine cerebral malaria (FMCM). Owing to the activation of events
central to mitochondrial dysfunctions, we monitored the structural integrity of
mitochondria in cerebral malaria (CM) infected brain tissue by transmission EM
(TEM) studies. Western blot analysis revealed the induction of Bcl(2), Bax,
cytochrome-c and p53 in both cortex and cerebellum. The TEM studies revealed
extensive vacuolation and swelling of mitochondria in infected brain suggestive
of a late stage of degeneration. Our results underscore the activation of an
intrinsic cell death pathway as evinced by the induction of mitochondria
associated apoptotic proteins Bcl(2), Bax and cytochrome-c and further envisages 
the induction of p53 as a possible continuation of the post receptor signaling
events associated with tumor necrosis factor induction following inflammatory
responses during CM. These findings may be crucial to mitochondrial dysfunctions 
underlying the pathology of FMCM.
