Live attenuated vaccines are used to combat tropical theileriosis in North
Africa, the Middle East, India, and China. The attenuation process is empirical
and occurs only after many months, sometimes years, of in vitro culture of
virulent clinical isolates. During this extensive culturing, attenuated lines
lose their vaccine potential. To circumvent this we engineered the rapid ablation
of the host cell transcription factor c-Jun, and within only 3 weeks the line
engineered for loss of c-Jun activation displayed in vitro correlates of
attenuation such as loss of adhesion, reduced MMP9 gelatinase activity, and
diminished capacity to traverse Matrigel. Specific ablation of a single infected 
host cell virulence trait (c-Jun) induced a complete failure of Theileria
annulata-transformed macrophages to disseminate, whereas virulent macrophages
disseminated to the kidneys, spleen, and lungs of Rag2/γC mice. Thus, in this
heterologous mouse model loss of c-Jun expression led to ablation of
dissemination of T. annulata-infected and transformed macrophages. The generation
of Theileria-infected macrophages genetically engineered for ablation of a
specific host cell virulence trait now makes possible experimental vaccination of
calves to address how loss of macrophage dissemination impacts the disease
pathology of tropical theileriosis.
