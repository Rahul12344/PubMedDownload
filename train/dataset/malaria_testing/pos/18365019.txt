Host genetic variants are known to confer resistance to Plasmodium blood stage
infection and to control malaria severity both in humans and mice. This work
describes the genetic mapping of a locus for resistance to liver stage parasite
in the mouse. First, we show that decreased susceptibility to the liver stage of 
Plasmodium berghei in the BALB/c mouse strain is attributable to intra-hepatic
factors and impacts on the initial phase of blood stage infection. We used QTL
mapping techniques to identify a locus controlling this susceptibility phenotype 
(LOD score 4.2) on mouse chromosome 17 (belr1 locus). Furthermore, analysis of
congenic mouse strains delimited the belr1 locus boundaries distally to the H2
region. Quantification of parasites in the liver of infected congenic mice
strongly suggested that the belr1 locus represents a genetic factor controlling
the expansion of P. berghei in the hepatic tissue. The mapping of belr1 locus
raises the hypothesis that host gene variation is able to control the progression
of Plasmodium liver stage infection and opens the possibility that the human
genomic region orthologue to belr1 may contain genes that confer resistance to
the human malaria liver stage.
