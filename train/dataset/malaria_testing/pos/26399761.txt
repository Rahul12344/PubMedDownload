Autophagy plays an important role in the defence against intracellular pathogens.
However, some microorganisms can manipulate this host cell pathway to their
advantage. In this study, we addressed the role of host cell autophagy during
Plasmodium berghei liver infection. We show that vesicles containing the
autophagic marker LC3 surround parasites from early time-points after invasion
and throughout infection and colocalize with the parasitophorous vacuole
membrane. Moreover, we show that the LC3-positive vesicles that surround
Plasmodium parasites are amphisomes that converge from the endocytic and
autophagic pathways, because they contain markers of both pathways. When the host
autophagic pathway was inhibited by silencing several of its key regulators such 
as LC3, Beclin1, Vps34 or Atg5, we observed a reduction in parasite size. We also
found that LC3 surrounds parasites in vivo and that parasite load is diminished
in a mouse model deficient for autophagy. Together, these results show the
importance of the host autophagic pathway for parasite development during the
liver stage of Plasmodium infection.
