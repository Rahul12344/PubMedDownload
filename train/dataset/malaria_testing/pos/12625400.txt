Arabia.

The biochemical parameters were studied in adult and young Friesian cattle
naturally infected with Theileria annulatta in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia.
Forty-three clinical cases of tropical theileriosis were studied, together with
40 clinically healthy Friesian cattle. Cattle clinically infected with T.
annulata had significantly lower serum total protein, albumin, globulin,
creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, iron and copper
concentrations and significantly higher AST activity and bilirubin concentration 
than the healthy cattle.
