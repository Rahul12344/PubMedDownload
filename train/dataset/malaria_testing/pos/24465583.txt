Plasmodium falciparum secretes a homologue of the translationally controlled
tumor protein (TCTP) into serum of infected individuals, although its role in
pathogenesis or virulence is unknown. To determine the effect of P. falciparum
TCTP on B cells as compared to human TCTP, fluorescently labeled proteins were
incubated on primary cultures of mouse splenic B cells and analyzed by flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy. Our results indicate that both recombinant
proteins are incorporated into B cells, but differ significantly in their rate
and percentage of incorporation, being significantly higher for P. falciparum
TCTP. Furthermore, P. falciparum TCTP showed a lower B cell proliferative effect 
than human TCTP, suggesting a mechanism through which the former could interfere 
in the host's immune response.
