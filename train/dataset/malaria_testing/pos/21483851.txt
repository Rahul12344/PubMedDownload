BACKGROUND: It has been shown previously that it is possible to obtain growth of 
Plasmodium falciparum in human erythrocytes grafted in mice lacking adaptive
immune responses by controlling, to a certain extent, innate defences with
liposomes containing clodronate (clo-lip). However, the reproducibility of those 
models is limited, with only a proportion of animals supporting longstanding
parasitemia, due to strong inflammation induced by P. falciparum. Optimisation of
the model is much needed for the study of new anti-malarial drugs, drug
combinations, and candidate vaccines.
MATERIALS/METHODS: We investigated the possibility of improving previous models
by employing the intravenous route (IV) for delivery of both human erythrocytes
(huRBC) and P. falciparum, instead of the intraperitoneal route (IP), by testing 
various immunosuppressive drugs that might help to control innate mouse defences,
and by exploring the potential benefits of using immunodeficient mice with
additional genetic defects, such as those with IL-2Rγ deficiency (NSG mice).
RESULTS: We demonstrate here the role of aging, of inosine and of the IL-2
receptor γ mutation in controlling P. falciparum induced inflammation. IV
delivery of huRBC and P. falciparum in clo-lip treated NSG mice led to successful
infection in 100% of inoculated mice, rapid rise of parasitemia to high levels
(up to 40%), long-lasting parasitemia, and consistent results from
mouse-to-mouse. Characteristics were closer to human infection than in previous
models, with evidence of synchronisation, partial sequestration, and receptivity 
to various P. falciparum strains without preliminary adaptation. However, results
show that a major IL-12p70 inflammatory response remains prevalent.
CONCLUSION: The combination of the NSG mouse, clodronate loaded liposomes, and IV
delivery of huRBC has produced a reliable and more relevant model that better
meets the needs of Malaria research.
