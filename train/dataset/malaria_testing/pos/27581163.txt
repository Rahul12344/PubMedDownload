BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the causative agent of human malaria of large
geographic distribution, with 35 million cases annually. In Brazil, it is the
most prevalent species, being responsible by around 70 % of the malaria cases.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed in Manaus (Amazonas, Brazil),
including 36 adult patients with primary malaria, 19 with recurrent malaria, and 
20 endemic controls. The ex vivo phenotypic features of circulating leukocyte
subsets (CD4(+) T-cells, CD8(+) T-cells, NK, NKT, B, B1 and Treg cells) as well
as the plasmatic cytokine profile (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF and IFN-γ) were
assessed, aiming at establishing patterns of immune response characteristic of
primary malaria vs recurrent malaria as compared to endemic controls.
RESULTS: The proportion of subjects with high levels of WBC was reduced in
malaria patients as compared to the endemic control. Monocytes were diminished
particularly in patients with primary malaria. The proportion of subjects with
high levels of all lymphocyte subsets was decreased in all malaria groups,
regardless their clinical status. Decreased proportion of subjects with high
levels of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells was found especially in the group of patients
with recurrent malaria. Data analysis indicated significant increase in the
proportion of the subjects with high plasmatic cytokine levels in both malaria
groups, characterizing a typical cytokine storm. Recurrent malaria patients
displayed the highest plasmatic IL-10 levels, that correlated directly with the
CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cells ratio and the number of malaria episodes.
CONCLUSION: The findings confirm that the infection by the P. vivax causes a
decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, which is intensified in the
cases of "recurrent malaria". The unbalanced CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cells ratio, as well
as increased IL-10 levels were correlated with the number of recurrent malaria
episodes. These results suggest that the gradual remodelling of the immune
response is dependent on the repeated exposure to the parasite, which involves a 
strict control of the immune response mediated by the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell
unbalance and exacerbated IL-10 secretion.
