AIM: The aim was to determine hemato-biochemical changes and rapid diagnosis of
Theileria annulata in naturally infected crossbred cows.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from lactating crossbred cows (n=40) between
3 and 7 years of age and showing clinical signs of tropical theileriosis were
collected, with or without anticoagulant, and analyzed for tropical theileriosis 
by direct smear, direct blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of
merozoite-piroplasm surface antigen (Tams1) gene specific amplicon, estimation of
hematological and biochemical parameters. Healthy crossbred cows (n=6), examined 
free from hemoprotozoan infections were included as control.
RESULTS: The infected crossbred cows revealed significantly (p<0.001) lower
values of total erythrocytic counts (4.46±0.2 × 10(6)/µL), hemoglobin (Hb
6.025±0.39 g%), packed cell volume (17.05±1.1%), mean corpuscular volume
(37.94±1.70 fL) and mean corpuscular Hb (13.5±0.48 pg; p<0.002) compared with
healthy control. The serum samples of infected cows revealed profound (p<0.05)
hyponatremia (Na 133.21±2.36 mEq/l) and hypocalcemia (Ca 8.39±0.34 mg%). Infected
crossbred cows showed a significant increase (p<0.05) of mean serum activity of
alanine aminotransferase (61.45±13.36 U/L), aspartate aminotransferase
(146.1±20.97 U/L), blood urea nitrogen (28.26±3.90 mg%), creatinine (1.55±0.13
mg%), direct bilirubin (0.33±0.04 mg%; p<0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase
(3001.32±167.0 U/L; p<001). Blood direct PCR revealed a 721-bp fragment amplified
from the target gene encoding 30-kDa major merozoite surface antigen of T.
annulata using specific primer pairs. This assay was positive for all the
infected animals.
CONCLUSION: The assessments of hemato-biochemical parameters in T. annulata
infected crossbred cows may be useful in understanding disease pathogenesis,
prognosis and corrective measures for supportive therapy. Moreover, blood direct 
PCR can reliably be used for rapid detection of T. annulata in conjunction with
microscopic examination.
