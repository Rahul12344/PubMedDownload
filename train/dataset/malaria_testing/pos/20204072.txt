Endothelin1 (ET-1) is a 21-amino acid peptide produced by the vascular
endothelium under hypoxia, that acts locally as regulator of vascular tone and
inflammation. The role of ET-1 in Plasmodium falciparum malaria is unknown,
although tissue hypoxia is frequent as a result of the cytoadherence of
parasitized red blood cell (pRBC) to the microvasculature. Here, we show that
both synthetic and endothelial-derived ET-1 are removed by parasitized RBC (D10
and W2 strains, chloroquine sensitive, and resistant, resp.) and native haemozoin
(HZ, malaria pigment), but not by normal RBC, delipidized HZ, or synthetic
beta-haematin (BH). The effect is dose dependent, selective for ET-1, but not for
its precursor, big ET-1, and not due to the proteolysis of ET-1. The results
indicate that ET-1 binds to the lipids moiety of HZ and membranes of infected
RBCs. These findings may help understanding the consequences of parasite
sequestration in severe malaria.
