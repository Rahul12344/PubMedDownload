Erythrocytic mechanisms involved in malarial infection are poorly understood. We 
have found that signaling via the erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor and
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (Galphas) regulated the entry
of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Agonists that stimulate
cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production led to an increase in malarial
infection that could be blocked by specific receptor antagonists. Moreover,
peptides designed to inhibit Galphas protein function reduced parasitemia in P.
falciparum cultures in vitro, and beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia of P.
berghei infections in an in vivo mouse model. Thus, signaling via the erythrocyte
beta2-adrenergic receptor and Galphas may regulate malarial infection across
parasite species.
