Parasite burden predicts disease severity in malaria and risk of death in
cerebral malaria patients. In murine experimental cerebral malaria (ECM),
parasite burden and CD8(+) T cells promote disease by mechanisms that are not
fully understood. We found that the majority of brain-recruited CD8(+) T cells
expressed granzyme B (GzmB). Furthermore, gzmB(-/-) mice harbored reduced
parasite numbers in the brain as a consequence of enhanced antiparasitic CD4(+) T
cell responses and were protected from ECM. We showed in these ECM-resistant mice
that adoptively transferred, Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells migrated to the brain,
but did not induce ECM until a critical Ag threshold was reached. ECM induction
was exquisitely dependent on Ag-specific CD8(+) T cell-derived perforin and GzmB,
but not IFN-Î³. In wild-type mice, full activation of brain-recruited CD8(+) T
cells also depended on a critical number of parasites in this tissue, which in
turn, was sustained by these tissue-recruited cells. Thus, an interdependent
relationship between parasite burden and CD8(+) T cells dictates the onset of
perforin/GzmB-mediated ECM.
