The mechanisms involved in the activation of the coagulation cascade in severe
falciparum malaria were studied in 22 adult patients (19 male, three female) aged
18-45 (mean +/- SD 31 +/- 11) years. Of these, nine had multiple vital organ
dysfunction, and bleeding occurred in four patients, two of whom died. During
acute illness the reduction in plasma antithrombin III (AT III) concentrations
and elevation in thrombin-AT III complexes were associated with significant
reductions in factor XII and prekallikrein activities, and an increase in the C1 
inhibitor antigen/activity ratio. Serial plasminogen activity remained within the
normal range in all patients while protein C activity was significantly reduced. 
All patients had markedly elevated plasma polymorphonuclear leucocyte elastase
(PMN-elastase) levels with mild depletion of alpha-2 macroglobulin but normal
concentrations of alpha-1 antitrypsin. There was no correlation between
PMN-elastase concentrations and any of the coagulation parameters or
concentrations of proteinase inhibitors. These results suggest that the intrinsic
pathway of the clotting cascade is activated in severe malaria. This may cause
activation of the complement system and release of bradykinin and PMN-elastase
and could contribute to the pathogenesis of severe malaria.
