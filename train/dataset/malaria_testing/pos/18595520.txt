OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of OERPs of young adults.
METHOD: Subjects included 55 young volunteers (male/female 25/30) with normosmic.
A complete ENT examination, A subjective olfactometry with T&T olfactometer were 
performed in all subjects. OERPs with stimulus isoamyl acetate (<1,648 x 10(-6)),
and air control were obtained in volunteers.
RESULT: OERPs were obtained in both male and female volunteers. P2, the primary
component of OERPs, was identified in all volunteers. No significant difference
was found in latencies of the components of OERPs between male and female
volunteers. N1-P2 interpeak amplitudes were larger in the female subjects than
male subjects (P<0.05).
CONCLUSION: P2 component of OERPs is identified in all young adults, both gender 
and interstimulus interval have impact on N1-P2 interpeak amplitudes.
