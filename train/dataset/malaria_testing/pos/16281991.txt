Activation of casein kinase II (CK2) was one of the first observations made on
how Theileria parasites manipulate host cell signal transduction pathways and we 
argue that CK2 induction may in fact contribute to many of the different
activation events that have been described since 1993 for Theileria-infected
lymphocytes such as sustained activation of transcription factors c-Myc and
NF-kappaB. CK2 also contributes to infected lymphocyte survival by inhibiting
caspase activation and is probably behind constitutive PI3-K activation by
phosphorylating PTEN. Finally, we also discuss how CK2A may act not only as a
kinase, but also as a stimulatory subunit for the protein phosphatase PP2A, so
dampening down the MEK/ERK and Akt/PKB pathways and for all these reasons we
propose CK2 as a central player in Theileria-induced lymphocyte transformation.
