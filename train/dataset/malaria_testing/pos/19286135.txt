Apicomplexa are obligate intracellular parasites that actively invade host cells 
using their membrane-associated, actin-myosin motor. The current view is that
host cell invasion by Apicomplexa requires the formation of a parasite-host cell 
junction, which has been termed the moving junction, but does not require the
active participation of host actin. Using Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and
Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, we show that host actin participates in parasite 
entry. Parasites induce the formation of a ring-shaped F-actin structure in the
host cell at the parasite-cell junction, which remains stable during parasite
entry. The Arp2/3 complex, an actin-nucleating factor, is recruited at the ring
structure and is important for parasite entry. We propose that Apicomplexa
invasion of host cells requires not only the parasite motor but also de novo
polymerization of host actin at the entry site for anchoring the junction on
which the parasite pulls to penetrate the host cell.
