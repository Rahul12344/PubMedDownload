The simultaneous typing of five-HLA loci at high resolution and the availability 
of pedigree data allowed us to characterize extended five-locus phased haplotypes
in 124 Nigerian families and to compare the observed frequencies with those
expected by an expectation-maximization algorithm for unphased data. Despite the 
occurrence of some frequent alleles at each locus (e.g. B*53:01, which is assumed
to protect against Plasmodium falciparum), as many as 82% of the sampled
individuals carry two unique five-locus haplotypes and only three extended
haplotypes with frequency above 1% exhibit significant linkage disequilibrium.
Although preliminary, these results reveal an extreme level of HLA diversity in
the Nigerian population, which reflects both its multi-ethnic composition and the
very ancient demographic history of African populations.
