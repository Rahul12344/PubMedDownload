BACKGROUND: Malaria remains endemic in several countries of South America with
low to moderate transmission intensity. Regional human migration through
underserved endemic areas may be responsible for significant parasite dispersion 
making the disease resilient to interventions. Thus, the genetic characterization
of malarial parasites is an important tool to assess how endemic areas may
connect via the movement of infected individuals. Here, four sites in
geographically separated areas reporting 80% of the malaria morbidity in Colombia
were studied. The sites are located on an imaginary transect line of 1,500 km
from the northwest to the south Pacific Coast of Colombia with a minimal distance
of 500 km between populations that display noticeable ethnic, economic,
epidemiological, and ecological differences.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 624 Plasmodium vivax samples from the 
four populations were genotyped by using eight microsatellite loci. Although a
strong geographic structure was expected between these populations, only moderate
evidence of genetic differentiation was observed using a suite of population
genetic analyses. High genetic diversity, shared alleles, and low linkage
disequilibrium were also found in these P. vivax populations providing no
evidence for a bottleneck or clonal expansions as expected from recent reductions
in the transmission that could have been the result of scaling up interventions
or environmental changes. These patterns are consistent with a disease that is
not only endemic in each site but also imply that there is gene flow among these 
populations across 1,500 km.
CONCLUSION /SIGNIFICANCE: The observed patterns in P. vivax are consistent with a
"corridor" where connected endemic areas can sustain a high level of genetic
diversity locally and can restore parasite-subdivided populations via migration
of infected individuals even after local interventions achieved a substantial
reduction of clinical cases. The consequences of these findings in terms of
control and elimination are discussed.
