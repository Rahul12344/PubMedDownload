OBJECTIVE: With emergence and geographically expanding of antimalarial resistance
worldwide, molecular markers are essential tool for surveillance of resistant
Plasmodium parasites. Recently, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
PF3D7_1343700 kelch propeller (K13-propeller) domain are shown to be associated
with artemisinin (ART) resistance in vivo and in vitro. This study aims to
investigate the ART resistance-associated polymorphisms of K13-propeller and
PfATPase6 genes in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Bioko Island, Equatorial
Guinea (EG).
METHODS: A total of 172 samples were collected from falciparum malaria patients
on Bioko Island between 2013 and 2014. The polymorphisms of K13-propeller and
PfATPase6 genes were analyzed by Nest-PCR and sequencing.
RESULTS: Sequences of K13-propeller and PfATPase6 were obtained from 90.74%
(98/108) and 91.45% (139/152) samples, respectively. The 2.04% (2/98) cases had
non-synonymous K13-propeller A578S mutation but no found the mutations associated
with ART resistance in Southeast Asia. For PfATPase6, the mutations were found at
positions N569K and A630S with the mutation prevalence of 7.91% (11/139) and
1.44% (2/139), respectively. In addition, a sample with the mixed type at
position I723V was discovered (0.72%, 1/139).
CONCLUSIONS: This study initially offers an insight of K13-propeller and
PfATPase6 polymorphisms on Bioko Island, EG. It suggests no widespread ART
resistance or tolerance in the region, and might be helpful for developing and
updating guidance for the use of ART-based combination therapies (ACTs).
