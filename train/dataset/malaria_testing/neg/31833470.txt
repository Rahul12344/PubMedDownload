Given that the C580Y polymorphism in the Plasmodium falciparum propeller domain
of the kelch 13 gene (pfk13) was documented in Guyana, monitoring for mutations
associated with antimalarial resistance was undertaken in neighboring Roraima
state in Brazil. Polymorphisms in the pfmdr1 and pfk13 genes were investigated in
275 P. falciparum samples. No pfk13 mutations were observed. Triple mutants 184F,
1042D, and 1246Y were observed in 100% of the samples successfully sequenced for 
the pfmdr1 gene, with 20.1% of these having an additional mutation at codon
1034C. Among them, 2.5% of samples harbored two copies of the pfmdr1 gene. We
found no evidence of the spread of C580Y parasites to Roraima state, Brazil. As
previously observed, the 184F, 1042D, and 1246Y mutations in the pfmdr1 gene
appear to be fixed in this region. Continued molecular surveillance is essential 
to detect any potential migration or local emergence of artemisinin-resistant
mutation.
