The hallmark of vaccines is their ability to prevent the spread of infectious
pathogens and thereby serve as invaluable public health tool. Despite their
medical relevance, there is a gap in our understanding of the physiological
factors that mediate innate and adaptive immune response to vaccines. The
endocannabinoid (eCB) system is a critical modulator of homeostasis in
vertebrates. Our results indicate that macrophages and dendritic cells produce
the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (2-AG) upon antigen activation.
We have also established that 2-AG levels are upregulated in the serum and in the
lymph node of mice during vaccination. We hypothesized that the intrinsic release
of eCBs from immune cells during activation by pathogenic antigens mitigate
inflammation, but also suppress overall innate and adaptive immune response. Here
we demonstrate, for the first time, that transient administration of the
cannabinoid receptor 2 antagonist AM630 (10 mg/kg) or inverse agonist JTE907
(3 mg/kg) during immunization heightens the intensity and breadth of
antigen-specific immune responses in young and aged mice through the upregulation
of immunomodulatory genes in secondary lymphoid tissues.
