Parasites of the genus Plasmodium infect all classes of amniotes (mammals, birds 
and reptiles) and display host specificity in their infections. It is therefore
generally believed that Plasmodium parasites co-evolved intimately with their
hosts. Here, we report that based on an evolutionary analysis using 22 genes in
the nuclear genome, extant lineages of Plasmodium parasites originated roughly in
the Oligocene epoch after the emergence of their hosts. This timing on the age of
the common ancestor of extant Plasmodium parasites suggest the importance of host
switches and lends support to the evolutionary scenario of a "malaria big bang"
that was proposed based on the evolutionary analysis using the mitochondrial
genome.
