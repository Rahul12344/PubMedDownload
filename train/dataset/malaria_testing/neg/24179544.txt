The overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters confers multidrug
resistance (MDR) to tumor cells. ABCG2 is a member of the ABC superfamily. The
present study aimed to investigate the correlation between ABCG2 expression and
the MDR of esophageal cancer and to estimate the therapeutic benefit of
downregulating ABCG2 expression and reversing chemoresistance in esophageal cells
using artesunate (Art). The Eca109/ABCG2 cell line was established by
transfecting the ABCG2 gene into Eca109 cells. The Eca109/ABCG2 esophageal cancer
cells with ABCG2 gene overexpression were resistant to adriamycin (ADM),
daunorubicin (DNR) and mitoxantrone (MIT), which indicated that ABCG2 may be
associated with drug resistance in esophageal cancer. Art is a noteworthy
antimalarial agent, particularly in severe and drug-resistant cancer cases, as
Art is able to reverse drug resistance. In the present study, Art also exerted
profound anticancer activity. The mechanism for the reversal of multidrug
resistance by Art in esophageal carcinoma was analyzed using cellular
experiments, but still remains largely unknown.
