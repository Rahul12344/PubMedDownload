Anopheles gambiae densovirus (AgDNV) is a potential microbial agent for
paratransgenesis and gene transduction in An. gambiae, the major vector of human 
malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the interaction between AgDNV and
An. gambiae is critical for using AgDNV in a basic and applied manner for
Anopheles gene manipulation. Here, we tested the effects of mosquito age, sex,
blood feeding status, and potential for horizontal transmission using an enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter AgDNV system. Neither mosquito age at
infection nor feeding regime affected viral titers. Female mosquitoes were more
permissive to viral infection than males. Despite low viral titers, infected
males were able to venereally transmit virus to females during mating, where the 
virus was localized with the transferred sperm in the spermathecae. These
findings will be useful for designing AgDNV-based strategies to manipulate
Anopheles gambiae.
