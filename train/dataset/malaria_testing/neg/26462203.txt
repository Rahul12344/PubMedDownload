Hispaniola, comprising Haiti and the Dominican Republic, has been identified as a
candidate for malaria elimination. However, incomplete surveillance data in Haiti
hamper efforts to assess the impact of ongoing malaria control interventions.
Characteristics of the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum populations can
be used to assess parasite transmission, which is information vital to evaluating
malaria elimination efforts. Here we characterize the genetic diversity of P.
falciparum samples collected from patients at seven sites in Haiti using 12
microsatellite markers previously employed in population genetic analyses of
global P. falciparum populations. We measured multiplicity of infections, level
of genetic diversity, degree of population geographic substructure, and linkage
disequilibrium (defined as non-random association of alleles from different
loci). For low transmission populations like Haiti, we expect to see few multiple
infections, low levels of genetic diversity, high degree of population structure,
and high linkage disequilibrium. In Haiti, we found low levels of multiple
infections (12.9%), moderate to high levels of genetic diversity (mean number of 
alleles per locus = 4.9, heterozygosity = 0.61), low levels of population
structure (highest pairwise Fst = 0.09 and no clustering in principal components 
analysis), and moderate linkage disequilibrium (ISA = 0.05, P<0.0001). In
addition, population bottleneck analysis revealed no evidence for a reduction in 
the P. falciparum population size in Haiti. We conclude that the high level of
genetic diversity and lack of evidence for a population bottleneck may suggest
that Haiti's P. falciparum population has been stable and discuss the
implications of our results for understanding the impact of malaria control
interventions. We also discuss the relevance of parasite population history and
other host and vector factors when assessing transmission intensity from genetic 
diversity data.
