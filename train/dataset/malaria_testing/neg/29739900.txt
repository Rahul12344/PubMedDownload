Plasmodium vivax causes heavy burdens of disease across malarious regions
worldwide. Mature P. vivax asexual and transmissive gametocyte stages occur in
the blood circulation, and it is often assumed that accumulation/sequestration in
tissues is not an important phase in their development. Here, we present a
systematic study of P. vivax stage distributions in infected tissues of nonhuman 
primate (NHP) malaria models as well as in blood from human infections. In a
comparative analysis of the transcriptomes of P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum 
blood-stage parasites, we found a conserved cascade of stage-specific gene
expression despite the greatly different gametocyte maturity times of these two
species. Using this knowledge, we validated a set of conserved asexual- and
gametocyte-stage markers both by quantitative real-time PCR and by antibody
assays of peripheral blood samples from infected patients and NHP (Aotus sp.).
Histological analyses of P. vivax parasites in organs of 13 infected NHP (Aotus
and Saimiri species) demonstrated a major fraction of immature gametocytes in the
parenchyma of the bone marrow, while asexual schizont forms were enriched to a
somewhat lesser extent in this region of the bone marrow as well as in sinusoids 
of the liver. These findings suggest that the bone marrow is an important
reservoir for gametocyte development and proliferation of malaria
parasites.IMPORTANCEPlasmodium vivax malaria continues to cause major public
health burdens worldwide. Yet, significant knowledge gaps in the basic biology
and epidemiology of P. vivax malaria remain, largely due to limited available
tools for research and diagnostics. Here, we present a systematic examination of 
tissue sequestration during P. vivax infection. Studies of nonhuman primates and 
malaria patients revealed enrichment of developing sexual stages (gametocytes)
and mature replicative stages (schizonts) in the bone marrow and liver, relative 
to those present in peripheral blood. Identification of the bone marrow as a
major P. vivax tissue reservoir has important implications for parasite diagnosis
and treatment.
