BACKGROUND: The I164L mutation on the dhfr gene confers high level resistance to 
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) but it is rare in Africa except in a cluster of
reports where prevalence >10% in highland areas of southwest Uganda and eastern
Rwanda. The occurrence of the dhfr I164L mutation was investigated in community
surveys in this area and examined the relationship to migration.
METHODS: A cross-sectional prevalence survey was undertaken in among villages
within the catchment areas of two health facilities in a highland site (Kabale)
and a highland fringe site (Rukungiri) in 2007. Sociodemographic details,
including recent migration, were collected for each person included in the study.
A total of 206 Plasmodium falciparum positive subjects were detected by rapid
diagnostic test; 203 in Rukungiri and 3 in Kabale. Bloodspot samples were taken
and were screened for dhfr I164L.
RESULTS: Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of the I164L mutations in
twelve P. falciparum positive samples giving an estimated prevalence of 8.6% in
Rukungiri. Of the three parasite positive samples in Kabale, none had I164L
mutations. Among the twelve I164L positives three were male, ages ranged from 5
to 90 years of age. None of those with the I164L mutation had travelled in the
8 weeks prior to the survey, although three were from households from which at
least one household member had travelled during that period. Haplotypes were
determined in non-mixed infections and showed the dhfr I164L mutation occurs in
both as a N51I + S108N + I164L haplotype (n = 2) and N51I + C59R + S108N + I164L 
haplotype (n = 5). Genotyping of flanking microsatellite markers showed that the 
I164L occurred independently on the triple mutant (N51I, C59R + S108N) and double
mutant (N51I + S108N) background.
CONCLUSIONS: There is sustained local transmission of parasites with the dhfr
I164L mutation in Rukungiri and no evidence to indicate its occurrence is
associated with recent travel to highly resistant neighbouring areas. The
emergence of a regional cluster of I164L in SW Uganda and Rwanda indicates that
transmission of I164L is facilitated by strong drug pressure in low transmission 
areas potentially catalysed in those areas by travel and the importation of
parasites from relatively higher transmission settings.
