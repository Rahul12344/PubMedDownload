BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have revolutionized the diagnosis of
malaria. Among the various factors affecting RDTs sensitivity is genetic
variation of the antigen used. The genetic variation in PfHRP2 and PfHRP3
proteins was studied among the Indian Plasmodium falciparum isolates.
METHODS: One hundred and forty isolates of P. falciparum were collected from six 
geographical regions of India. Target genes encoding PfHRP2 and PfHRP3 antigens
were sequenced to study genetic polymorphism. Minimum detection limit giving a
positive rapid diagnostic test was also determined.
RESULTS: Extensive variations were observed in amino acid repeat types of PfHRP2 
and PfHRP3. PfHRP2 exhibited more polymorphism than PfHRP3. Significant relation 
was observed between type 2 and type 7 repeats and RDT detection rate as higher
number of these repeats showed better sensitivity with RDTs.
CONCLUSION: The results provide insights into the genetic diversity of Pfhrp2 and
Pfhrp3 genes among Indian P. falciparum population and its relation to RDT
sensitivity.
