BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has emerged and
spread in Southeast Asia. In areas where resistance is established longer courses
of artemisinin-based combination therapy have improved cure rates.
METHODS: The standard 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) was compared
with an extended 5-day regimen for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum
malaria in Kayin state in South-East Myanmar, an area of emerging artemisinin
resistance. Late parasite clearance dynamics were described by microscopy and
quantitative ultra-sensitive PCR. Patients were followed up for 42 days.
RESULTS: Of 154 patients recruited (105 adults and 49 children < 14 years) 78
were randomized to 3 days and 76 to 5 days AL. Mutations in the P. falciparum
kelch13 propeller gene (k13) were found in 46% (70/152) of infections, with F446I
the most prevalent propeller mutation (29%; 20/70). Both regimens were
well-tolerated. Parasite clearance profiles were biphasic with a slower
submicroscopic phase which was similar in k13 wild-type and mutant infections.
The cure rates were 100% (70/70) and 97% (68/70) in the 3- and 5-day arms
respectively. Genotyping of the two recurrences was unsuccessful.
CONCLUSION: Despite a high prevalence of k13 mutations, the current first-line
treatment, AL, was still highly effective in this area of South-East Myanmar. The
extended 5 day regimen was very well tolerated, and would be an option to prolong
the useful therapeutic life of AL. Trial registration NCT02020330. Registered 24
