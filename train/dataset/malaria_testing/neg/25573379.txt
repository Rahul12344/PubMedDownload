BACKGROUND: Malaria is a worldwide infectious disease caused by Plasmodium
parasites and transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes. The malaria vector
mosquito Anopheles can trigger effective mechanisms to control completion of the 
Plasmodium lifecycle; the mosquito immune response to the parasite involves
several pathways which are not yet well characterized. Plasmodium metabolite
hemozoin has emerged as a potent immunostimulator of mammalian tissues. In this
study, we aim to investigate the role of this parasite's by-product as stimulator
of Anopheles gambiae immunity to Plasmodium berghei.
METHODS: Female mosquitoes were inoculated with hemozoin and the Plasmodium
infection rate and intensity were measured. Differences between treatments were
detected by Zero-inflated models. Microarray transcription analysis was performed
to assess gene expression response to hemozoin. Genome-wide analysis results were
confirmed by stimulation of Anopheles gambiae tissues and cells with hemozoin and
silencing of REL2-F and its negative regulator Caspar.
RESULTS: Gene expression profiles revealed that hemozoin activates several
immunity genes, including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs). Importantly, we found that the Immune deficiency (Imd) pathway
Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-κB) transcription factor REL2, in its full-length form 
REL2-F, was induced upon hemozoin treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: We have for the first time shown the impact of hemozoin treatment in
Plasmodium infection, reducing both rate and intensity of the infection. We
propose that hemozoin boosts the innate immunity in Anopheles, activating key
effector genes involved in mosquito resistance to Plasmodium, and this activation
is REL2-mediated.
