Reversible protein phosphorylation regulated by kinases and phosphatases controls
many cellular processes. Although essential functions for the malaria parasite
kinome have been reported, the roles of most protein phosphatases (PPs) during
Plasmodium development are unknown. We report a functional analysis of the
Plasmodium berghei protein phosphatome, which exhibits high conservation with the
P. falciparum phosphatome and comprises 30 predicted PPs with differential and
distinct expression patterns during various stages of the life cycle. Gene
disruption analysis of P. berghei PPs reveals that half of the genes are likely
essential for asexual blood stage development, whereas six are required for
sexual development/sporogony in mosquitoes. Phenotypic screening coupled with
transcriptome sequencing unveiled morphological changes and altered gene
expression in deletion mutants of two N-myristoylated PPs. These findings provide
systematic functional analyses of PPs in Plasmodium, identify how phosphatases
regulate parasite development and differentiation, and can inform the
identification of drug targets for malaria.
