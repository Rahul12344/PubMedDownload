A family of calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) is a unique enzyme which
plays crucial roles in intracellular calcium signaling in plants, algae, and
protozoa. CDPKs of malaria parasites are known to be key regulators for
stage-specific cellular responses to calcium, a widespread secondary messenger
that controls the progression of the parasite. In our study, we identified a gene
encoding Plasmodium vivax CDPK4 (PvCDPK4) and characterized its molecular
property and cellular localization. PvCDPK4 was a typical CDPK which had
well-conserved N-terminal kinase domain and C-terminal calmodulin-like structure 
with 4 EF hand motifs for calcium-binding. The recombinant protein of EF hand
domain of PvCDPK4 was expressed in E. coli and a 34 kDa product was obtained.
Immunofluorescence assay by confocal laser microscopy revealed that the protein
was expressed at the mature schizont of P. vivax. The expression of PvCDPK4-EF in
schizont suggests that it may participate in the proliferation or egress process 
in the life cycle of this parasite.
