The use of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP) for treatment of vivax malaria is
uncommon in most malarious areas, but Plasmodium vivax isolates are exposed to SP
because of mixed infections with other Plasmodium species. As P. vivax is the
most prevalent species of human malaria parasites in Iran, monitoring of
resistance of the parasite against the drug is necessary. In the present study,
50 blood samples of symptomatic patients were collected from 4 separated
geographical regions of south-east Iran. Point mutations at residues 57, 58, 61, 
and 117 were detected by the PCR-RFLP method. Polymorphism at positions 58R,
117N, and 117T of P. vivax dihydrofolate reductase (Pvdhfr) gene has been found
in 12%, 34%, and 2% of isolates, respectively. Mutation at residues F57 and T61
was not detected. Five distinct haplotypes of the Pvdhfr gene were demonstrated. 
The 2 most prevalent haplotypes were F57S58T61S117 (62%) and F57S58T61N117 (24%).
Haplotypes with 3 and 4 point mutations were not found. The present study
suggested that P. vivax in Iran is under the pressure of SP and the sensitivity
level of the parasite to SP is diminishing and this fact must be considered in
development of malaria control programs.
