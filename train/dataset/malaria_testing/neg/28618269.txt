Obligate intracellular parasites must efficiently invade host cells in order to
mature and be transmitted. For the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,
invasion of host red blood cells (RBCs) is essential. Here we describe a
parasite-specific transcription factor PfAP2-I, belonging to the Apicomplexan AP2
(ApiAP2) family, that is responsible for regulating the expression of genes
involved in RBC invasion. Our genome-wide analysis by ChIP-seq shows that PfAP2-I
interacts with a specific DNA motif in the promoters of target genes. Although
PfAP2-I contains three AP2 DNA-binding domains, only one is required for binding 
of the target genes during blood stage development. Furthermore, we find that
PfAP2-I associates with several chromatin-associated proteins, including the
Plasmodium bromodomain protein PfBDP1 and that complex formation is associated
with transcriptional regulation. As a key regulator of red blood cell invasion,
PfAP2-I represents a potential new antimalarial therapeutic target.
