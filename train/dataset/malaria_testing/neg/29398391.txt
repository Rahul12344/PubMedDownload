BACKGROUND: Antimalarial resistance is rapidly spreading across parts of
southeast Asia where dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is used as first-line
treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The first published reports about
resistance to antimalarial drugs came from western Cambodia in 2013. Here, we
analyse genetic changes in the P falciparum population of western Cambodia in the
6 years before those reports.
METHODS: We analysed genome sequence data on 1492 P falciparum samples from 11
locations across southeast Asia, including 464 samples collected in western
Cambodia between 2007 and 2013. Different epidemiological origins of resistance
were identified by haplotypic analysis of the kelch13 artemisinin resistance
locus and the plasmepsin 2-3 piperaquine resistance locus.
FINDINGS: We identified more than 30 independent origins of artemisinin
resistance, of which the KEL1 lineage accounted for 140 (91%) of 154 parasites
resistant to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. In 2008, KEL1 combined with PLA1,
the major lineage associated with piperaquine resistance. By 2013, the KEL1/PLA1 
co-lineage had reached a frequency of 63% (24/38) in western Cambodia and had
spread to northern Cambodia.
INTERPRETATION: The KEL1/PLA1 co-lineage emerged in the same year that
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine became the first-line antimalarial drug in western
Cambodia and spread rapidly thereafter, displacing other artemisinin-resistant
parasite lineages. These findings have important implications for management of
the global health risk associated with the current outbreak of
multidrug-resistant malaria in southeast Asia.
