Rickettsia rickettsii is a tick-borne obligate intracellular bacterium that
causes Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF). In Brazil, two species of ticks in
the genus Amblyomma, A. sculptum and A. aureolatum, are incriminated as vectors
of this bacterium. Importantly, these two species present remarkable differences 
in susceptibility to R. rickettsii infection, where A. aureolatum is more
susceptible than A. sculptum. In the current study, A. aureolatum and A. sculptum
ticks were fed on suitable hosts previously inoculated with R. rickettsii,
mimicking a natural infection. As control, ticks were fed on non-infected
animals. Both midgut and salivary glands of all positively infected ticks were
colonized by R. rickettsii. We did not observe ticks with infection restricted to
midgut, suggesting that important factors for controlling rickettsial
colonization were produced in this organ. In order to identify such factors, the 
total RNA extracted from the midgut (MG) was submitted to next generation RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq). The majority of the coding sequences (CDSs) of A. sculptum 
differentially expressed by infection were upregulated, whereas most of modulated
CDSs of A. aureolatum were downregulated. The functional categories that comprise
upregulated CDSs of A. sculptum, for instance, metabolism, signal transduction,
protein modification, extracellular matrix, and immunity also include CDSs of A. 
aureolatum that were downregulated by infection. This is the first study that
reports the effects of an experimental infection with the highly virulent R.
rickettsii on the gene expression of two natural tick vectors. The distinct
transcriptional profiles of MG of A. sculptum and A. aureolatum upon infection
stimulus strongly suggest that molecular factors in this organ are responsible
for delineating the susceptibility to R. rickettsii. Functional studies to
determine the role played by proteins encoded by differentially expressed CDSs in
the acquisition of R. rickettsii are warranted and may be considered as targets
for the development of strategies to control the tick-borne pathogens as well as 
to control the tick vectors.
