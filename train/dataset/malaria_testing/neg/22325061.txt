This report describes the optimization and evaluation of a simple single-step
lysis protocol to measure luciferase bioluminescence from genetically modified
Plasmodium falciparum. This protocol utilizes a modified commercial buffer to
improve speed of assay and consistency in the bioluminescence signal measured by 
reducing the manipulation steps required to release the cytoplasmic fraction. The
utility of this improved assay protocol is demonstrated in typical assays that
explore absolute and temporal gene expression activity.
