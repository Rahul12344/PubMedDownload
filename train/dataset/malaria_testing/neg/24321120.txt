BACKGROUND: The sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SDX/PYR) combination had been chosen 
to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Malaysia for more than 30 years.
Non-silent mutations in dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthase (dhps) genes are responsible for the resistance to pyrimethamine and
sulphadoxine, respectively. This study reports the mutational analysis of pfdhfr 
and pfdhps in single Plasmodium falciparum infection isolates from the interior
division of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
METHODS: A total of 22 P. falciparum single infection isolates collected from two
districts of the interior division of Sabah from February to November 2010 were
recruited for the mutational study of pfdhfr and pfdhps. Both genes were
amplified by nested PCR prior to DNA sequencing and mutational analysis.
RESULTS: A total of three pfdhfr and four pfdhps alleles were identified. The
most prevalent pfdhfr allele is ANRNL (86%) involving triple mutation at position
108(S to N), 59(C to R) and 164(I to L). In pfdhps, two novel alleles, SGTGA
(73%) and AAKAA (5%) were identified. Alleles involving triple mutation in both
pfdhfr (ANRNL) and pfdhps (SGTGA), which were absent in Sabah in a study
conducted about 15 years ago, are now prevalent.
CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of mutations in SDX/PYR associated drug resistance
genes are reported in this study. This mutational study of pfdhps and pfdhfr
indicating that SDX/PYR should be discontinued in this region.
