Binding of host immunoglobulin is a common immune evasion mechanism demonstrated 
by microbial pathogens. Previous work showed that the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum binds the Fc-region of human IgM molecules, resulting in a coating of 
IgM on the surface of infected erythrocytes. IgM binding is a property of P.
falciparum strains showing virulence-related phenotypes such as erythrocyte
rosetting. The parasite ligands for IgM binding are members of the diverse P.
falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein One (PfEMP1) family. However, little is
known about the amino acid sequence requirements for IgM binding. Here we studied
an IgM binding domain from a rosette-mediating PfEMP1 variant, DBL4ζ of
TM284var1, and found that the minimal IgM binding region mapped to the central
region of the DBL domain, comprising all of subdomain 2 and adjoining parts of
subdomains 1 and 3. Site-directed mutagenesis of charged amino acids within
subdomain 2, predicted by molecular modelling to form the IgM binding site,
showed no marked effect on IgM binding properties. Overall, this study identifies
the minimal IgM binding region of a PfEMP1 domain, and indicates that the
existing homology model of PfEMP1-IgM interaction is incorrect. Further work is
needed to identify the specific interaction site for IgM within the minimal
binding region of PfEMP1.
