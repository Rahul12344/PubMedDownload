Eukaryotic flagella are conserved microtubule-based organelles that drive cell
motility. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has a single flagellate
stage: the male gamete in the mosquito. Three rounds of endomitotic division in
male gametocyte together with an unusual mode of flagellum assembly rapidly
produce eight motile gametes. These processes are tightly coordinated, but their 
regulation is poorly understood. To understand this important developmental
stage, we studied the function and location of the microtubule-based motor
kinesin-8B, using gene-targeting, electron microscopy, and live cell imaging.
Deletion of the kinesin-8B gene showed no effect on mitosis but disrupted 9+2
axoneme assembly and flagellum formation during male gamete development and also 
completely ablated parasite transmission. Live cell imaging showed that
kinesin-8B-GFP did not co-localise with kinetochores in the nucleus but instead
revealed a dynamic, cytoplasmic localisation with the basal bodies and the
assembling axoneme during flagellum formation. We, thus, uncovered an unexpected 
role for kinesin-8B in parasite flagellum formation that is vital for the
parasite life cycle.
