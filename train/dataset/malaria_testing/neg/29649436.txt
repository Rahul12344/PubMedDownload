Ever since Plasmodium intraerythrocytic development was reported to proceed via
an unusual "hardwired" transcriptional cascade, the control of gene transcription
in malaria parasites has been an area of intense investigation. In this issue of 
Cell Host & Microbe, Toenhake et al. (2018) illuminate this intriguing issue by
applying ATAC sequencing.
