BACKGROUND: The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly dangerous
invasive vector of numerous medically important arboviruses including dengue,
chikungunya and Zika. In four decades it has spread from tropical Southeast Asia 
to many parts of the world in both tropical and temperate climes. The rapid
invasion process of this mosquito is supported by its high ecological and genetic
plasticity across different life history traits. Our aim was to investigate
whether wild populations, both native and adventive, also display transcriptional
genetic variability for functions that may impact their biology, behaviour and
ability to transmit arboviruses, such as sensory perception.
RESULTS: Antennal transcriptome data were derived from mosquitoes from a native
population from Ban Rai, Thailand and from three adventive Mediterranean
populations: Athens, Greece and Arco and Trento from Italy. Clear
inter-population differential transcriptional activity was observed in different 
gene categories related to sound perception, olfaction and viral infection. The
greatest differences were detected between the native Thai and the Mediterranean 
populations. The two Italian populations were the most similar. Nearly one
million quality filtered SNP loci were identified.
CONCLUSION: The ability to express this great inter-population transcriptional
variability highlights, at the functional level, the remarkable genetic
flexibility of this mosquito species. We can hypothesize that the differential
expression of genes, including those involved in sensory perception, in different
populations may enable Ae. albopictus to exploit different environments and
hosts, thus contributing to its status as a global vector of arboviruses of
public health importance. The large number of SNP loci present in these
transcripts represents a useful addition to the arsenal of high-resolution
molecular markers and a resource that can be used to detect selective pressure
and adaptive changes that may have occurred during the colonization process.
