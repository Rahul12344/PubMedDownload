Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are being increasingly recognized as important
regulators of gene expression. A recent paper in Genome Biology reports the
identification of a lncRNA family in Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of the most
deadly form of malaria, that may help to explain the mechanism of antigenic
variation in virulence genes of this important pathogen.
