BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) is a
highly polymorphic adherence receptor expressed on the surface of infected
erythrocytes. Based on sequence homology PfEMP-1 variants have been grouped into 
three major groups A-C, the highly conserved VAR2CSA variants, and semi-conserved
types defined by tandem runs of specific domains ("domain cassettes" (DC)). The
PfEMP-1 type expressed determines the adherence phenotype, and is associated with
clinical outcome of infection.
METHODS: Parasite isolates from Beninese children or women presenting with,
respectively, CM or PAM were collected along with samples from patients with
uncomplicated malaria (UM). We assessed the transcript level of var genes by
RT-qPCR and the expression of PfEMP-1 proteins by LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: Var genes encoding DC8 and Group A PfEMP-1 were transcribed more often
and at higher levels in cerebral malaria vs. uncomplicated malaria patients.
LC-MS/MS identified peptides from group A, DC8 PfEMP-1 more frequently in
cerebral malaria than in uncomplicated malaria and pregnancy-associated malaria
samples.
CONCLUSION: This is the first study to show association between PfEMP-1 subtype
and disease outcome by direct analysis of parasites proteome. The results
corroborate that group A and specifically the PfEMP-1 types DC8 are universally
associated with cerebral malaria. This is a crucial observation for promoting
studies on malaria pathogenesis.
