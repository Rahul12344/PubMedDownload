The purpose of this study was to conduct a survey of Dirofilaria immitis
infection among stray cats in Korea using nested PCR. We included 235 stray cats 
(121 females and 114 males) and evaluated each for the presence of feline
heartworm infection. Blood samples were collected from 135 cats in Daejeon, 50
cats in Seoul, and 50 cats from Gyeonggi-do (Province). Of the 235 DNA samples,
14 (6.0%) were positive for D. immitis. The prevalence of infection in male cats 
(8/114, 7.0%) tended to be higher than that in female cats (6/121, 5.0%), but the
difference was not statistically significant. In each location, 8, 2, and 4 cats 
were positive for infection, respectively, based on DNA testing. No significant
differences in the prevalence were observed among the geographic regions,
although the rate of infection was higher in Gyeonggi-do (8.0%) than Daejeon
(5.9%) and Seoul (4.0%). We submitted 7 of the 14 D. immitis DNA-positive samples
for sequencing analysis. All samples corresponded to partial D. immitis
cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequences with 99% homology to the D. immitis
sequence deposited in GenBank (accession no. FN391553). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first survey using nested PCR to analyze the prevalence of
D. immitis in stray cats in Korea.
