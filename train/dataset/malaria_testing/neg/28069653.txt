The emergence of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin in Southeast
Asia threatens malaria control and elimination activities worldwide. Multiple
polymorphisms in the P. falciparum kelch gene found in chromosome 13 (Pfk13) have
been associated with artemisinin resistance. Surveillance of potential drug
resistance loci within a population that may emerge under increasing drug
pressure is an important public health activity. In this context, P. falciparum
infections from an observational surveillance study in Senegal were genotyped
using targeted amplicon deep sequencing (TADS) for Pfk13 polymorphisms. The
results were compared to previously reported Pfk13 polymorphisms from around the 
world. A total of 22 Pfk13 propeller domain polymorphisms were identified in this
study, of which 12 have previously not been reported. Interestingly, of the 10
polymorphisms identified in the present study that were also previously reported,
all had a different amino acid substitution at these codon positions. Most of the
polymorphisms were present at low frequencies and were confined to single
isolates, suggesting they are likely transient polymorphisms that are part of
naturally evolving parasite populations. The results of this study underscore the
need to identify potential drug resistance loci existing within a population,
which may emerge under increasing drug pressure.
