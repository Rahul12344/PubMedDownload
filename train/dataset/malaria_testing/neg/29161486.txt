INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial DNA has proven its utility for the study of insect
evolution. Genes such as cytochrome b (Cytb) and the transfer gene for serine
(SertRNA) can be used to compare closely related organisms.
OBJECTIVE: The phylogenetic utility of Cytb-SertRNA-IG1-ND1 was tested for
polymorphisms, and secondary structure modeling in SertRNA was done to detect
possible cryptic species in Anopheles neivai.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from Colombia, Guatemala, and the type locality 
in Panamá were collected and sequenced for specimen comparison based on DNA
polymorphisms, and secondary structure modeling for the SertRNA gene.
RESULTS: Thirty-six sequences for A. neivai and A. pholidotus were obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphic variants were detected in A. neivai for
Cytb-SertRNA-IG1- ND1. Despite this variation in A. neivai, cryptic species could
not be detected.
