BACKGROUND: Primaquine (PQ) is recommended as an addition to standard malaria
treatments in pre-elimination settings due to its pronounced activity against
mature Plasmodium falciparum gametocytes, the parasite stage responsible for
onward transmission to mosquitoes. However, PQ may trigger haemolysis in
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient individuals. Additional human 
genetic factors, including polymorphisms in the human cytochrome P450 2D6
(CYP2D6) complex, may negatively influence the efficacy of PQ. This study
assessed the prevalence of G6PD deficiency and two important CYP2D6 variants in
representative pre-elimination settings in South Africa, to inform malaria
elimination strategies.
METHODS: Volunteers (n = 248) attending six primary health care facilities in a
malaria-endemic region of South Africa were enrolled between October and November
2015. G6PD status was determined phenotypically, using a CareStart™ G6PD rapid
diagnostic test (RDT), and genotypically for two common African G6PD variants,
namely A+ (A376G) and A- (G202A, A542T, G680T & T968C) by PCR, restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and DNA sequencing. CYP2D6*4 and CYP2D6*17
variants were determined with PCR and RFLP.
RESULTS: A prevalence of 13% (33/248) G6PD deficiency was observed in the cohort 
by G6PD RDT whilst by genotypic assessment, 32% (79/248) were A+ and 3.2% were
A-, respectively. Among the male participants, 11% (6/55) were G6PD A-
hemizygous; among females 1% (2/193) were G6PD A- homozygous and 16% (32/193)
G6PD A- heterozygous. The strength of agreement between phenotyping and
genotyping result was fair (Cohens Kappa κ = 0.310). The negative predictive
value for the G6PD RDT for detecting hemizygous, homozygous and heterozygous
individuals was 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), compared to the more sensitive
genotyping. The CYP2D6*4 allele frequencies for CYP2D6*4 (inferred poor
metabolizer phenotype) and CYP2D6*17 (inferred intermediate metabolizer
phenotype) were 3.2 and 19.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Phenotypic and genotypic analyses both detected low prevalence of
G6PD deficiency and the CYP2D6*4 variants. These findings, combined with
increasing data confirming safety of single low-dose PQ in individuals with
African variants of G6PD deficiency, supports the deployment of single low-dose
PQ as a gametocytocidal drug. PQ would pose minimal risks to the study
populations and could be a useful elimination strategy in the study area.
