The data article reports data of the proteins expressed in female Anopheles
stephensi salivary glands. Proteomic data were acquired using high-resolution
mass spectrometers - Orbitrap-Velos and Orbitrap-Elite. Samples derived from
adult female A. stephensi salivary glands led to the identification of 4390
proteins. Mass spectrometry data were analyzed on Proteome Discoverer (Version
2.1) platform with Sequest and Mascot search engines. The identified proteins
were analyzed for their Gene Ontology annotation, interaction network and their
possible roles in vector-parasite interaction. The data provided here are related
to our published article "Integrating transcriptomics and proteomics data for
accurate assembly and annotation of genomes" (Prasad et al., 2017) [1].
