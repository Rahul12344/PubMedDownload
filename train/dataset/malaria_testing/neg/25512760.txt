ABO blood group antigens are expressed either on the surface of red blood cells
either on a variety of other cells. Based on the available knowledge of the genes
involved in their biosynthesis and their tissue distribution, their polymorphism 
has been suggested to provide intraspecies diversity allowing to cope with
diverse and rapidly evolving pathogens. Accordingly, the different prevalence of 
ABO group genotypes among the populations has been demonstrated to be driven by
malaria selection. In the similar manner, a particular ABO blood group may
contribute to favour life-extension via biological mechanisms important for
surviving or eluding serious disease. In this review, we will suggest the
possible association of ABO group with age-related diseases and longevity taking 
into account the biological role of the ABO glycosyltransferases on some
inflammatory mediators as adhesion molecules.
