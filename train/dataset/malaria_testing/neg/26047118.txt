4,4'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been re-recommended by the World
Health Organization for malaria mosquito control. Previous DDT use has resulted
in resistance, and with continued use resistance will increase in terms of level 
and extent. Drosophila melanogaster is a model dipteran that has many available
genetic tools, numerous studies done on insecticide resistance mechanisms, and is
related to malaria mosquitoes allowing for extrapolation. The 91-R strain of
D. melanogaster is highly resistant to DDT (>1500-fold), however, there is no
mechanistic scheme that accounts for this level of resistance. Recently, reduced 
penetration, increased detoxification, and direct excretion have been identified 
as resistance mechanisms in the 91-R strain. Their interactions, however, remain 
unclear. Use of UAS-RNAi transgenic lines of D. melanogaster allowed for the
targeted knockdown of genes putatively involved in DDT resistance and has
validated the role of several cuticular proteins (Cyp4g1 and Lcp1), cytochrome
P450 monooxygenases (Cyp6g1 and Cyp12d1), and ATP binding cassette transporters
(Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1) involved in DDT resistance. Further, increased
sensitivity to DDT in the 91-R strain after intra-abdominal dsRNA injection for
Mdr50, Mdr65, and Mrp1 was determined by a DDT contact bioassay, directly
implicating these genes in DDT efflux and resistance.
