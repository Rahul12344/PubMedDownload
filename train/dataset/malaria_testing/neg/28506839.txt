The availability of the genomic data of diverse parasites provides an opportunity
to identify new drug candidates against neglected tropical diseases affecting
people worldwide. Histone modifying enzymes (HMEs) are potential candidates since
they play key roles in the regulation of chromatin modifications, thus globally
regulating gene expression. Furthermore, aberrant epigenetic states are often
associated with human diseases, leading to great interest in HMEs as therapeutic 
targets. Our work focused on two families of protein lysine deacetylases (HDACs
and sirtuins). First, we identified potential homologues in the predicted
proteomes of selected taxa by using hidden Markov model profiles. Then, we
reconstructed the evolutionary relationships of protein sequences by Bayesian
inference and maximum likelihood method. In addition, we constructed homology
models for five parasite HDACs to provide information for experimental validation
and structure-based optimization of inhibitors. Our results showed that parasite 
genomes code for diverse HDACs and sirtuins. The evolutionary pattern of protein 
deacetylases with additional experimental data points to these enzymes as common 
drug targets among parasites. This work has improved the functional annotation of
approximately 63% HDACs and 51% sirtuins in the selected taxa providing insights 
for experimental design. Homology models pointed out structural conservation and 
differences among parasite and human homologues and highlight potential
candidates for further inhibitor development. Some of these parasite proteins are
undergoing RNA interference or knockout analyses to validate the function of
their corresponding genes. In the future, we will investigate the main functions 
performed by these proteins, related phenotypes, and their potential as
therapeutic targets.
