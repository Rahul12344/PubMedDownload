Inhibiting Plasmodium development in mosquitoes will block malaria transmission. 
Fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) is critical for parasite infection in
Anopheles gambiae and facilitates Plasmodium invasion in mosquitoes through
interacting with gametocytes and ookinetes. To test the hypothesis that small
molecules that disrupt this interaction will prevent parasites from infecting
mosquitoes, we developed an ELISA-based method to screen a fungal extract
library. We obtained a candidate fungal extract of Aspergillus niger that
inhibited the interaction between FREP1 and P. falciparum infected cells by about
92%. The inhibition specificity was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays.
Notably, feeding mosquitoes with the candidate fungal extract significantly
inhibited P. falciparum infection in the midgut without cytotoxicity or
inhibition of the development of P. falciparum gametocytes or ookinetes. A
bioactive natural product that prevents FREP1 from binding to gametocytes or
ookinetes was isolated and identified as P-orlandin. Importantly, the nontoxic
orlandin significantly reduced P. falciparum infection intensity in mosquitoes.
Therefore, disruption of the interaction between FREP1 and parasites effectively 
reduces Plasmodium infection in mosquitoes. Targeting FREP1 with small molecules 
is thus an effective novel approach to block malaria transmission.
