BACKGROUND: Malaria still claims substantial lives of individuals in Tanzania.
Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spray (IRS) are used as major
malaria vector control tools. These tools are facing great challenges from the
rapid escalating insecticide resistance in malaria vector populations. This
review presents the information on the dynamics and monitoring of insecticide
resistance in malaria vectors in mainland Tanzania since 1997. The information is
important to policy-makers and other vector control stakeholders to reflect and
formulate new resistance management plans in the country.
METHODS: Reviewed articles on susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance in
malaria vectors to insecticides across mainland Tanzania were systematically
searched from the following databases: PubMed, Google scholar, HINARI and AGORA. 
The inclusion criteria were articles published between 2000 and 2017, reporting
susceptibility of malaria vectors to insecticides, mechanisms of resistance in
the mainland Tanzania, involving field collected adult mosquitoes, and mosquitoes
raised from the field collected larvae. Exclusion criteria were articles
reporting insecticide resistance in larval bio-assays, laboratory strains, and
unpublished data. Reviewed information include year of study, malaria vectors,
insecticides, and study sites. This information was entered in the excel sheet
and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 30 articles met the selection criteria. The rapid increase of
insecticide resistance in the malaria vectors across the country was reported
since year 2006 onwards. Insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato
(s.l.) was detected in at least one compound in each class of all recommended
insecticide classes. However, the Anopheles funestus s.l. is highly resistant to 
pyrethroids and DDT. Knockdown resistance (kdr) mechanism in An. gambiae s.l. is 
widely studied in the country. Biochemical resistance by detoxification enzymes
(P450s, NSE and GSTs) in An. gambiae s.l. was also recorded. Numerous P450s genes
associated with metabolic resistance were over transcribed in An. gambiae s.l.
collected from agricultural areas. However, no study has reported mechanisms of
insecticide resistance in the An. funestus s.l. in the country.
CONCLUSION: This review has shown the dynamics and monitoring of insecticide
resistance in malaria vector populations across mainland Tanzanian. This
highlights the need for devising improved control approaches of the malaria
vectors in the country.
