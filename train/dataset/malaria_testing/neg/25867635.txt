Vector mosquitoes inflict more human suffering than any other organism-and kill
more than one million people each year. The mosquito genome projects facilitated 
research in new facets of mosquito biology, including functional genetic studies 
in the primary African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae and the dengue and yellow
fever vector Aedes aegypti. RNA interference- (RNAi-) mediated gene silencing has
been used to target genes of interest in both of these disease vector mosquito
species. Here, we describe a procedure for preparation of chitosan/interfering
RNA nanoparticles that are combined with food and ingested by larvae. This
technically straightforward, high-throughput, and relatively inexpensive
methodology, which is compatible with long double stranded RNA (dsRNA) or small
interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules, has been used for the successful knockdown of 
a number of different genes in A. gambiae and A. aegypti larvae. Following larval
feedings, knockdown, which is verified through qRT-PCR or in situ hybridization, 
can persist at least through the late pupal stage. This methodology may be
applicable to a wide variety of mosquito and other insect species, including
agricultural pests, as well as other non-model organisms. In addition to its
utility in the research laboratory, in the future, chitosan, an inexpensive,
non-toxic and biodegradable polymer, could potentially be utilized in the field.
