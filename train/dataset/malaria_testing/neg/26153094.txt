Malaria parasites alter mosquito feeding behaviour in a way that enhances
parasite transmission. This is widely considered a prime example of manipulation 
of host behaviour to increase onward transmission, but transient immune challenge
in the absence of parasites can induce the same behavioural phenotype. Here, we
show that alterations in feeding behaviour depend on the timing and dose of
immune challenge relative to blood ingestion and that these changes are
functionally linked to changes in insulin signalling in the mosquito gut. These
results suggest that altered phenotypes derive from insulin signalling-dependent 
host resource allocation among immunity, blood feeding, and reproduction in a
manner that is not specific to malaria parasite infection. We measured large
increases in mosquito survival and subsequent transmission potential when feeding
patterns are altered. Leveraging these changes in physiology, behaviour and life 
history could promote effective and sustainable control of female mosquitoes
responsible for transmission.
