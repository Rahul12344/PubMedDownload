The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum are lethal
human parasites that have developed elegant strategies of immune evasion by
antigenic variation. Despite the vast evolutionary distance between the two taxa,
both parasites employ strict monoallelic expression of their membrane proteins,
variant surface glycoproteins in Trypanosomes and the var, rif and stevor genes
in Plasmodium, in order to evade their host's immune system. Additionally, both
telomeric location and epigenetic controls are prominent features of these
membrane proteins. As such, telomeres, chromatin structure and nuclear
organization all contribute to control of gene expression and immune evasion.
Here, we discuss the importance of epigenetics and sub-nuclear context for the
survival of these disease-causing parasites.
