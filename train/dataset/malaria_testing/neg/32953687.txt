Background: Circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is one of the most important surface
sporozoite antigens in malaria, recently considered as a candidate for
vaccination. Considering the importance of CSP, this study was conducted to
investigate the polymorphism and genetic diversity of Plasmodium vivax
Circumsporozoite Protein (Pvcsp) in the southeastern region of Iran during
2015-2016.
Methods: To investigate polymorphism and genetic diversity, 20 blood samples were
collected from patients with P. vivax, then DNA was extracted and amplified using
partial sequence of CSP gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were
sequenced and compared to sequences from genomic databases using BLAST. Genetic
evaluation and phylogenic analysis were performed using MEGA7 and DnaSP5
software's on 38 sequences include 20 sequences of our study and 18 sequences of 
Gene Bank.
Results: Eleven isolates were VK210 genotype and 9 isolates contained VK247. The 
result of variable segregation nucleotide site indicated that the differentiation
of sequences in CSP were 25.67% in our 20 samples which are less than the 38
samples with a value of 26.67%. Comparing the ratio of dN/dS regions in the CSP
gene indicates that the CSP varies more synonymously and amino acid has lower
variation. Out of 38 samples, 35 unique haplotypes were identified based on 1042 
nucleotide sequences in CSP, showing a variation percentage of 99.4%.
Conclusion: The Tajima D analyses showed that CSP gene in P. vivax had a positive
number in the total analyzed sequences, which means that the P. vivax mutations
are in order to select positive evolution.
