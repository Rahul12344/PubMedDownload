BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is an increasing threat to 
vector control tools currently deployed in endemic countries. Resistance
management must be an integral part of National Malaria Control Programmes'
(NMCPs) next strategic plans to alleviate the risk of control failure. This
obviously will require a clear database on insecticide resistance to support the 
development of such a plan. The present work gathers original data on insecticide
resistance between 2009 and 2015 across Côte d'Ivoire in West Africa.
METHODS: Two approaches were adopted to build or update the resistance data in
the country. Resistance monitoring was conducted between 2013 and 2015 in 35
sentinel sites across the country using the WHO standard procedure of
susceptibility test on adult mosquitoes. Four insecticide families (pyrethroids, 
organochlorides, carbamates and organophosphates) were tested. In addition to
this survey, we also reviewed the literature to assemble existing data on
resistance between 2009 and 2015.
RESULTS: High resistance levels to pyrethroids, organochlorides and carbamates
were widespread in all study sites whereas some Anopheles populations remained
susceptible to organophosphates. Three resistance mechanisms were identified,
involving high allelic frequencies of kdr L1014F mutation (range = 0.46-1),
relatively low frequencies of ace-1 R (below 0.5) and elevated activity of
insecticide detoxifying enzymes, mainly mixed function oxidases (MFO), esterase
and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in almost all study sites.
CONCLUSION: This detailed map of resistance highlights the urgent need to develop
new vector control tools to complement current long-lasting insecticidal nets
(LLINs) although it is yet unclear whether these resistance mechanisms will
impact malaria transmission control. Researchers, industry, WHO and stakeholders 
must urgently join forces to develop alternative tools. By then, NMCPs must
strive to develop effective tactics or plans to manage resistance keeping in mind
country-specific context and feasibility.
