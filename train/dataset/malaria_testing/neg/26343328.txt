Tissue pantetheinase, encoded by the VNN1 gene, regulates response to stress, and
previous studies have shown that VNN genes contribute to the susceptibility to
malaria. Herein, we evaluated the role of pantetheinase on erythrocyte
homeostasis and on the development of malaria in patients and in a new mouse
model of pantetheinase insufficiency. Patients with cerebral malaria have
significantly reduced levels of serum pantetheinase activity (PA). In mouse, we
show that a reduction in serum PA predisposes to severe malaria, including
cerebral malaria and severe anemia. Therefore, scoring pantetheinase in serum may
serve as a severity marker in malaria infection. This disease triggers an acute
stress in erythrocytes, which enhances cytoadherence and hemolysis. We speculated
that serum pantetheinase might contribute to erythrocyte resistance to stress
under homeostatic conditions. We show that mutant mice with a reduced serum PA
are anemic and prone to phenylhydrazine-induced anemia. A cytofluorometric and
spectroscopic analysis documented an increased frequency of erythrocytes with an 
autofluorescent aging phenotype. This is associated with an enhanced oxidative
stress and shear stress-induced hemolysis. Red blood cell transfer and bone
marrow chimera experiments show that the aging phenotype is not cell intrinsic
but conferred by the environment, leading to a shortening of red blood cell
half-life. Therefore, serum pantetheinase level regulates erythrocyte life span
and modulates the risk of developing complicated malaria.
