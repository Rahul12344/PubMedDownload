Leishmaniasis is one of the most important parasitic diseases after malaria. The 
standard treatment of leishmaniasis includes pentavalent antimonials (SbV);
however, these drugs are associated with serious adverse effects. There have been
very few studies pertaining to their side effects and mechanism of action in the 
fetus. This investigation examines the effects of meglumine antimoniate (MA) on
the survival rate, angiogenesis and cellular apoptosis in the human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were treated with varying doses of MA
(100-800 μg/ml) for 24, 48 and 72 h and the survival rate was studied by
colorimetric assay, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, migration (scratch)
assay and tube formation assay. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) 
studies indicated that the most important genes involved in presenting
angiogenesis included VEGF and its receptors (Kdr and Flt-1), NP1 and Hif-1α
genes including the anti-apoptotic gene of Bcl2, were significantly reduced
compared to the control group (p < 0.05). In contrast, the most leading genes
involved in the phenomenon of apoptosis were P53, Bax, Bak, Apaf-1 and caspases
3, 8 and 9, which were significantly up regulated compared to the control group
(p < 0.05).
