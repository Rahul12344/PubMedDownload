"Triatoma brasiliensis species complex" was defined as a monophyletic group of
the species: T. brasiliensis, T. juazeirensis, T. melanica, and T. sherlocki. An 
alternative grouping scheme proposed the concept of "Brasiliensis subcomplex"
which included the former species together with T. melanocephala, T. petrocchiae,
T. lenti, T. tibiamaculata, and T. vitticeps. To evaluate the relationship among 
these taxa we combined the results obtained with four mitochondrial genes (12S,
16S, COI and Cytb, adding to 1811bp) and geometric morphometric analysis of wings
and heads. Panstrongylus megistus was included in the analysis as it was
previously found related to T. tibiamaculata, T. melanocephala and T. vitticeps. 
The results of both molecular and morphometric approaches clearly grouped the
species analyzed into two monophyletic units, supported by both genetic and wing 
variability. The first one (G1) comprises the four species originally included in
the T. brasiliensis species complex plus T. lenti and T. petrocchiae. The second 
group (G2) was composed by T. melanocephala, T. tibiamaculata and T. vitticeps,
and remarkably, P. megistus if considering wing variability and phylogenetic
results. Nevertheless, geometric morphometrics of heads provided a quantitative
measurement that discriminates Panstrongylus from the Triatoma species based on
the position of the antennal insertion relative to eyes, as it is used as the
generic distinctive character. The discrepancy among approaches questions the
validity of this character to define Panstrongylus genus. Independently of the
chosen group definition -"T. brasiliensis species complex" or "Brasiliensis
subcomplex"-we propose to delimit it to species of G1 that are all associated
with the Caatinga biome in the Brazilian Northeast. G2 are the ones associated
with the Atlantic Forest biome.
