Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced by the Chinese traditional herb
Artemisia annua and is used for the treatment of malaria. It is known that
salicylic acid (SA) can enhance artemisinin content but the mechanism by which it
does so is not known. In this study, we systematically investigated a basic
leucine zipper family transcription factor, AaTGA6, involved in SA signaling to
regulate artemisinin biosynthesis. We found specific in vivo and in vitro binding
of the AaTGA6 protein to a 'TGACG' element in the AaERF1 promoter. Moreover, we
demonstrated that AaNPR1 can interact with AaTGA6 and enhance its DNA-binding
activity to its cognate promoter element 'TGACG' in the promoter of AaERF1, thus 
enhancing artemisinin biosynthesis. The artemisinin contents in
AaTGA6-overexpressing and RNAi transgenic plants were increased by 90-120% and
decreased by 20-60%, respectively, indicating that AaTGA6 plays a positive role
in artemisinin biosynthesis. Importantly, heterodimerization with AaTGA3
significantly inhibits the DNA-binding activity of AaTGA6 and plays a negative
role in target gene activation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that binding of
AaTGA6 to the promoter of the artemisinin-regulatory gene AaERF1 is enhanced by
AaNPR1 and inhibited by AaTGA3. Based on these findings, AaTGA6 has potential
value in the genetic engineering of artemisinin production.
