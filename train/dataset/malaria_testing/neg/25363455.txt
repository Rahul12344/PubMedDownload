Primaquine is the only generally available anti-malarial that prevents relapse in
vivax and ovale malaria, and the only potent gametocytocide in falciparum
malaria. Primaquine becomes increasingly important as malaria-endemic countries
move towards elimination, and although it is widely recommended, it is commonly
not given to malaria patients because of haemolytic toxicity in subjects who are 
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient (gene frequency typically
3-30% in malaria endemic areas; >180 different genetic variants). In six decades 
of primaquine use in approximately 200 million people, 14 deaths have been
reported. Confining the estimate to reports with known denominators gives an
estimated mortality of one in 621,428 (upper 95% CI: one in 407,807). All but one
death followed multiple dosing to prevent vivax malaria relapse. Review of
dose-response relationships and clinical trials of primaquine in G6PD deficiency 
suggests that the currently recommended WHO single low dose (0.25Â mg base/kg) to 
block falciparum malaria transmission confers a very low risk of haemolytic
toxicity.
