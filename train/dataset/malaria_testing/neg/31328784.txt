A most interesting exception within the parasitic Apicomplexa is Nephromyces, an 
extracellular, probably mutualistic, endosymbiont found living inside molgulid
ascidian tunicates (i.e., sea squirts). Even though Nephromyces is now known to
be an apicomplexan, many other questions about its nature remain unanswered. To
gain further insights into the biology and evolutionary history of this unusual
apicomplexan, we aimed to 1) find the precise phylogenetic position of
Nephromyces within the Apicomplexa, 2) search for the apicoplast genome of
Nephromyces, and 3) infer the major metabolic pathways in the apicoplast of
Nephromyces. To do this, we sequenced a metagenome and a metatranscriptome from
the molgulid renal sac, the specialized habitat where Nephromyces thrives. Our
phylogenetic analyses of conserved nucleus-encoded genes robustly suggest that
Nephromyces is a novel lineage sister to the Hematozoa, which comprises both the 
Haemosporidia (e.g., Plasmodium) and the Piroplasmida (e.g., Babesia and
Theileria). Furthermore, a survey of the renal sac metagenome revealed 13 small
contigs that closely resemble the genomes of the nonphotosynthetic reduced
plastids, or apicoplasts, of other apicomplexans. We show that these apicoplast
genomes correspond to a diverse set of most closely related but genetically
divergent Nephromyces lineages that co-inhabit a single tunicate host. In
addition, the apicoplast of Nephromyces appears to have retained all biosynthetic
pathways inferred to have been ancestral to parasitic apicomplexans. Our results 
shed light on the evolutionary history of the only probably mutualistic
apicomplexan known, Nephromyces, and provide context for a better understanding
of its life style and intricate symbiosis.
