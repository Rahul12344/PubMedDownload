Plasmodium falciparum resistance to artemisinin has emerged in the Greater Mekong
Subregion and now poses a threat to malaria control and prevention. Recent work
has identified mutations in the kelch propeller domain of the P. falciparum K13
gene to be associated artemisinin resistance as defined by delayed parasite
clearance and ex vivo ring stage survival assays. Species specific primers for
the two most prevalent human malaria species, P. falciparum and P. vivax, were
designed and tested on multiple parasite isolates including human, rodent, and
non- humans primate Plasmodium species. The new protocol described here using the
species specific primers only amplified their respective species, P. falciparum
and P. vivax, and did not cross react with any of the other human malaria
Plasmodium species. We provide an improved species specific PCR and sequencing
protocol that could be effectively used in areas where both P. falciparum and P. 
vivax are circulating. To design this improved protocol, the kelch gene was
analyzed and compared among different species of Plasmodium. The kelch propeller 
domain was found to be highly conserved across the mammalian Plasmodium species.
