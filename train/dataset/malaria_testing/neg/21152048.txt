Genetically-modified mutants are now indispensable Plasmodium gene-function
reagents, which are also being pursued as genetically attenuated parasite
vaccines. Currently, the generation of transgenic malaria-parasites requires the 
use of drug-resistance markers. Here we present the development of an
FRT/FLP-recombinase system that enables the generation of transgenic parasites
free of resistance genes. We demonstrate in the human malaria parasite, P.
falciparum, the complete and efficient removal of the introduced resistance gene.
We targeted two neighbouring genes, p52 and p36, using a construct that has a
selectable marker cassette flanked by FRT-sequences. This permitted the
subsequent removal of the selectable marker cassette by transient transfection of
a plasmid that expressed a 37Â°C thermostable and enhanced FLP-recombinase. This
method of removing heterologous DNA sequences from the genome opens up new
possibilities in Plasmodium research to sequentially target multiple genes and
for using genetically-modified parasites as live, attenuated malaria vaccines.
