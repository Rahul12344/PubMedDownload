BACKGROUND: Due to the widespread resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to
chloroquine drug, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has been
recommended as the first-line treatment. This study aims to evaluate the extent
of chloroquine resistance in P. falciparum infection after the introduction of
ACT. This study was carried out based on the mutation analysis in P. falciparum
chloroquine resistant transporter (pfcrt) and P. falciparum multidrug resistance 
1 (pfmdr1) genes. Identification of these molecular markers plays a significant
role in monitoring and assessment of drug resistance as well as in designing an
effective antimalarial drug policy in India.
METHODS: Sixty blood samples were collected from patients infected with P.
falciparum from JIPMER, Puducherry and MKCG Medical College, Odisha. Polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was performed, targeting 
the point mutation of K76T in pfcrt and N86Y in pfmdr1 gene. The PCR products
were sequenced, genotyped and further analysed for amino acid changes in these
codons.
RESULTS: The frequency of pfcrt mutation at 76th position was dominant for mutant
T allele with 56.7% and wild type K, 43.3%. Majority of pfmdr1 86 allele were
wild type, with N (90%) and mutant, Y (10%). Additionally, we found three
haplotypes for CQ resistance, SVMNT, CVIET and CVIKT in association with the
pfcrt gene. However, a poorly studied SNP in pfmdr1 gene (Y184F) associated with 
CQ resistance showed high frequency (70%) in P. falciparum isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: The point mutation K76T of pfcrt is high in P. falciparum suggesting
a sustained high CQ resistance even after five years of the introduction of ACTs 
for antimalarial therapy. The present study suggests a strong association of CQ
resistance with pfcrt T76, but not with the pfmdr1 Y86 mutation. However,
sequence analysis showed that Y184F mutation on pfmdr1 gene was found to be
associated with high resistance. Also, a new pfcrt haplotype 'CVIKT' associated
with CQ resistance was found to be present in Indian strains of P. falciparum.
The data obtained from this study helps in continuous monitoring of drug
resistance in malaria and also suggests the need for careful usage of CQ in
Plasmodium vivax malarial treatment.
