Plasmodium falciparum parasites in the merozoite stage invade human erythrocytes 
and cause malaria. Invasion requires multiple interactions between merozoite
ligands and erythrocyte receptors. P. falciparum reticulocyte binding homolog 5
(PfRh5) forms a complex with the PfRh5-interacting protein (PfRipr) and
Cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) and binds erythrocytes via the host
receptor basigin. However, the specific role that PfRipr and CyRPA play during
invasion is unclear. Using P. falciparum lines conditionally expressing PfRipr
and CyRPA, we show that loss of PfRipr or CyRPA function blocks growth due to the
inability of merozoites to invade erythrocytes. Super-resolution microscopy
revealed that PfRipr, CyRPA, and PfRh5 colocalize at the junction between
merozoites and erythrocytes during invasion. PfRipr, CyRPA, and
PfRipr/CyRPA/PfRh5-basigin complex is required for triggering the Ca(2+) release 
and establishing the tight junction. Together, these results establish that the
PfRh5/PfRipr/CyRPA complex is essential in the sequential molecular events
leading to parasite invasion of human erythrocytes.
