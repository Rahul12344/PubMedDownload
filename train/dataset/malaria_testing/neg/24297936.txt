The malaria parasite-resistance island (PRI) of the African mosquito vector,
Anopheles gambiae, was mapped to five genomic regions containing 80 genes, using 
coexpression patterns of genomic blocks. High-throughput sequencing identified
347 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms within these genes in
mosquitoes from malaria-endemic areas in Kenya. Direct association studies
between nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms and Plasmodium falciparum
infection identified three naturally occurring genetic variations in each of
three genes (An. gambiae adenosine deaminase, fibrinogen-related protein 30, and 
fibrinogen-related protein 1) that were associated significantly with parasite
infection. A role for these genes in the resistance phenotype was confirmed by
RNA interference knockdown assays. Silencing fibrinogen-related protein 30
increased parasite infection significantly, whereas ablation of
fibrinogen-related protein 1 transcripts resulted in mosquitoes nearly free of
parasites. The discovered genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms are
anticipated to be useful in the development of tools for malaria control in
endemic areas in Africa.
