BACKGROUND: Genome wide sequence analyses of malaria parasites from widely
separated areas of the world have identified contrasting population structures
and signatures of selection. To compare relatively closely situated but
ecologically contrasting regions within an endemic African country, population
samples of Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates were collected in Ghana from
Kintampo in the central forest-savannah area, and Navrongo in a drier savannah
area ~350 km to the north with more seasonally-restricted transmission. Parasite 
DNA was sequenced and paired-end reads mapped to the P. falciparum reference
genome.
RESULTS: High coverage genome wide sequence data for 85 different clinical
isolates enabled analysis of 121,712 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The 
local populations had similar proportions of mixed genotype infections, similar
SNP allele frequency distributions, and eleven chromosomal regions had elevated
integrated haplotype scores (|iHS|) in both. A between-population Rsb metric
comparing extended haplotype homozygosity indicated a stronger signal within
Kintampo for one of these regions (on chromosome 14) and in Navrongo for two of
these regions (on chromosomes 10 and 13). At least one gene in each of these
identified regions is a potential target of locally varying selection. The
candidates include genes involved in parasite development in mosquitoes, members 
of variant-expressed multigene families, and a leading vaccine-candidate target
of immunity.
CONCLUSIONS: Against a background of very similar population structure and
selection signatures in the P. falciparum populations of Ghana, three narrow
genomic regions showed evidence indicating local differences in historical timing
or intensity of selection. Sampling of closely situated populations across
heterogeneous environments has potential to refine the mapping of important loci 
under temporally or spatially varying selection.
