Fitness costs are key determinants of whether drug resistance alleles establish
and how fast they spread within populations. More than 125 different kelch13
alleles, each containing a different amino acid substitution, have arisen in
Southeast Asian malaria parasite (Plasmodium falciparum) populations under
artemisinin selection over the past 15 years in a dramatic example of a soft
selective event. However, just one of these alleles (C580Y) is now outcompeting
other alleles in multiple different countries and is spreading toward fixation.
Here we examine the fitness consequences of C580Y, relative to another less
successful kelch13 mutation (R561H), to try to explain the distinctive dynamics
of C580Y. We hypothesized that C580Y will show lower fitness costs than other
kelch13 substitutions in the absence of artemisinin treatment. We used
CRISPR/Cas9 methods to introduce single mutations (C580Y or R561H) or synonymous 
control edits into a wild-type parasite isolated on the Thailand-Myanmar border, 
conducted replicated head-to-head competition assays, and determined the outcome 
of competition using deep sequencing of kelch13 amplicons. Contrary to our
predictions, these experiments reveal that C580Y carries higher fitness costs (s 
[selection coefficient] = 0.15 ± 0.008 [1 standard error {SE}]) than R561H (s =
0.084 ± 0.005). Furthermore, R561H outcompetes C580Y in direct competition (s =
0.065 ± 0.004). We conclude that fitness costs of C580Y in isolation are unlikely
to explain the rapid spread of this substitution.
