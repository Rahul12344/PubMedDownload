The characterization of the transcriptome and proteome of Plasmodium falciparum
has been a tremendous resource for the understanding of the molecular physiology 
of this parasite. However, the translational dynamics that link steady-state mRNA
with protein levels are not well understood. In this study, we bridge this
disconnect by measuring genome-wide translation using ribosome profiling, through
five stages of the P. falciparum blood phase developmental cycle. Our findings
show that transcription and translation are tightly coupled, with overt
translational control occurring for less than 10% of the transcriptome.
Translationally regulated genes are predominantly associated with merozoite
egress functions. We systematically define mRNA 5' leader sequences, and 3' UTRs,
as well as antisense transcripts, along with ribosome occupancy for each, and
establish that accumulation of ribosomes on 5' leaders is a common transcript
feature. This work represents the highest resolution and broadest portrait of
gene expression and translation to date for this medically important parasite.
