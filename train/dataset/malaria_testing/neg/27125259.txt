FOXO3, a member of the Forkhead family of proteins, plays a role in controlling
immune response. FOXO3 gene variant rs12212067 has been associated to
differential severity of infectious diseases like malaria. In this study, we
assessed whether this FOXO3 gene polymorphism is related to susceptibility to
infection by Trypanosoma cruzi and/or chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy. A total of
1171 individuals from a Colombian region endemic for Chagas disease, classified
as seronegative (n = 595), seropositive asymptomatic (n = 175) and chronic
Chagasic cardiomyopathy (n = 401) were genotyped for the FOXO3 rs12212067 using
TaqMan allelic discrimination. Our results showed no statistically significantly 
differences between allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs12212067 in
seronegative individuals compared with seropositive individuals. Similarly, we
observed no evidence of association when asymptomatic individuals were compared
with chronic Chagasic cardiomyopathy patients. Our data suggest that the FOXO3
genetic variant rs12212067 do not play an important role in Chagas disease.
