From the eighth century onward, the Indian Ocean was the scene of extensive trade
of sub-Saharan African slaves via sea routes controlled by Muslim Arab and
Swahili traders. Several populations in present-day Pakistan and India are
thought to be the descendants of such slaves, yet their history of admixture and 
natural selection remains largely undefined. Here, we studied the genome-wide
diversity of the African-descent Makranis, who reside on the Arabian Sea coast of
Pakistan, as well that of four neighboring Pakistani populations, to investigate 
the genetic legacy, population dynamics, and tempo of the Indian Ocean slave
trade. We show that the Makranis are the result of an admixture event between
local Baluch tribes and Bantu-speaking populations from eastern or southeastern
Africa; we dated this event to ∼300 years ago during the Omani Empire domination.
Levels of parental relatedness, measured through runs of homozygosity, were found
to be similar across Pakistani populations, suggesting that the Makranis rapidly 
adopted the traditional practice of endogamous marriages. Finally, we searched
for signatures of post-admixture selection at traits evolving under positive
selection, including skin color, lactase persistence, and resistance to malaria. 
We demonstrate that the African-specific Duffy-null blood group-believed to
confer resistance against Plasmodium vivax infection-was recently introduced to
Pakistan through the slave trade and evolved adaptively in this P. vivax
malaria-endemic region. Our study reconstructs the genetic and adaptive history
of a neglected episode of the African Diaspora and illustrates the impact of
recent admixture on the diffusion of adaptive traits across human populations.
