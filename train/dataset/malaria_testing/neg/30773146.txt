Apicomplexan parasites are amongst the most prevalent and morbidity-causing
pathogens worldwide. They are responsible for severe diseases in humans and
livestock and are thus of great public health and economic importance. Until the 
sequencing of apicomplexan genomes at the beginning of this century, the
occurrence of N- and O-glycoproteins in these parasites was much debated. The
synthesis of rudimentary and divergent N-glycans due to lineage-specific gene
loss is now well established and has been recently reviewed. Here, we will focus 
on recent studies that clarified classical O-glycosylation pathways and described
new nucleocytosolic glycosylations in Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agents of 
toxoplasmosis. We will also review the glycosylation of proteins containing
thrombospondin type 1 repeats by O-fucosylation and C-mannosylation, newly
discovered in Toxoplasma and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The
functional significance of these post-translational modifications has only
started to emerge, but the evidence points towards roles for these protein
glycosylation pathways in tissue cyst wall rigidity and persistence in the host, 
oxygen sensing, and stability of proteins involved in host invasion.
