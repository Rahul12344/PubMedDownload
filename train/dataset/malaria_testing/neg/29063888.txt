Two millilitres of peripheral blood was collected from 323 patients of different 
age groups and rapid diagnosis (RDT test) was performed. Parasite genomic DNA was
extracted from whole blood and MSP-2 gene-based diversity and polymorphism was
determined followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using
Taq 1 and Vsp 1 digestion of each polymerase chain reaction product to analyse
MSP-2 genotypes. Twenty-six sequences of P. falciparum MSP-2 gene were retrieved 
from the current GenBank database to represent strains from various geographical 
locations and were analysed for the Taq 1 and Vsp 1 enzyme restriction sites
using in silico restriction digestion in Sequence Manipulation Suite, Version 2.
