More than 80% of available malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are based on the
detection of histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) for diagnosis of Plasmodium
falciparum malaria. Recent studies have shown the genes that code for this
protein and its paralog, histidine-rich protein-3 (PfHRP3), are absent in
parasites from the Peruvian Amazon Basin. Lack of PfHRP2 protein through deletion
of the pfhrp2 gene leads to false-negative RDT results for P. falciparum. We have
evaluated the extent of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions in a convenience sample 
of 198 isolates from six sites in three states across the Brazilian Amazon Basin 
(Acre, Rondonia and Para) and 25 isolates from two sites in Bolivia collected at 
different times between 2010 and 2012. Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene and their flanking 
genes on chromosomes 7 and 13, respectively, were amplified from 198 blood
specimens collected in Brazil. In Brazil, the isolates collected in Acre state,
located in the western part of the Brazilian Amazon, had the highest percentage
of deletions for pfhrp2 25 (31.2%) of 79, while among those collected in
Rondonia, the prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletion was only 3.3% (2 out of 60
patients). In isolates from Para state, all parasites were pfhrp2-positive. In
contrast, we detected high proportions of isolates from all 3 states that were
pfhrp3-negative ranging from 18.3% (11 out of 60 samples) to 50.9% (30 out of 59 
samples). In Bolivia, only one of 25 samples (4%) tested had deleted pfhrp2 gene,
while 68% (17 out of 25 samples) were pfhrp3-negative. Among the isolates tested,
P. falciparum pfhrp2 gene deletions were present mainly in those from Acre State 
in the Brazilian Amazon. These results indicate it is important to reconsider the
use of PfHRP2-based RDTs in the western region of the Brazilian Amazon and to
implement appropriate surveillance systems to monitor pfhrp2 gene deletions in
this and other parts of the Amazon region.
