BACKGROUND: Medicines that exert oxidative pressure on red blood cells (RBC) can 
cause severe hemolysis in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) 
deficiency. Due to X-chromosome inactivation, females heterozygous for G6PD with 
1 allele encoding a G6PD-deficient protein and the other a normal protein produce
2 RBC populations each expressing exclusively 1 allele. The G6PD mosaic is not
captured with routine G6PD tests.
METHODS: An open-source software tool for G6PD cytofluorometric data
interpretation is described. The tool interprets data in terms of % bright RBC,
or cells with normal G6PD activity in specimens collected from 2 geographically
and ethnically distinct populations, an African American cohort (USA) and a Karen
and Burman ethnic cohort (Thailand) comprising 242 specimens including 89
heterozygous females.
RESULTS: The tool allowed comparison of data across 2 laboratories and both
populations. Hemizygous normal or deficient males and homozygous normal or
deficient females cluster at narrow % bright cells with mean values of 96%, or 6%
(males) and 97%, or 2% (females), respectively. Heterozygous females show a
distribution of 10-85% bright cells and a mean of 50%. The distributions are
associated with the severity of the G6PD mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent cytofluorometric G6PD analysis facilitates
interlaboratory comparison of cellular G6PD profiles and contributes to
understanding primaquine-associated hemolytic risk.
