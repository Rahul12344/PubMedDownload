Explaining how and why reproductive isolation evolves and determining which forms
of reproductive isolation have the largest impact on the process of population
divergence are major goals in the study of speciation. By studying recent
adaptive radiations in incompletely isolated taxa, it is possible to identify
barriers involved at early divergence before other confounding barriers emerge
after speciation is complete. Sibling species of the Anopheles gambiae complex
offer opportunities to provide insights into speciation mechanisms. Here, we
studied patterns of reproductive isolation among three taxa, Anopheles coluzzii, 
An. gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis, to compare its strength at different
spatial scales, to dissect the relative contribution of pre- versus postmating
isolation, and to infer the involvement of ecological divergence on
hybridization. Because F1 hybrids are viable, fertile and not uncommon,
understanding the dynamics of hybridization in this trio of major malaria vectors
has important implications for how adaptations arise and spread across the group,
and in planning studies of the safety and efficacy of gene drive as a means of
malaria control. We first performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
published surveys reporting on hybrid prevalence, showing strong reproductive
isolation at a continental scale despite geographically restricted exceptions.
Second, we exploited our own extensive field data sets collected at a regional
scale in two contrasting environmental settings, to assess: (i) levels of
premating isolation; (ii) spatio/temporal and frequency-dependent dynamics of
hybridization, (iii) relationship between reproductive isolation and ecological
divergence and (iv) hybrid viability penalty. Results are in accordance with
ecological speciation theory predicting a positive association between the
strength of reproductive isolation and degree of ecological divergence, and
indicate that postmating isolation does contribute to reproductive isolation
among these species. Specifically, only postmating isolation was positively
associated with ecological divergence, whereas premating isolation was correlated
with phylogenetic distance.
