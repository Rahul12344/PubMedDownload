The Plasmodium falciparum kinome includes a family of four protein kinases
(Pfnek-1 to -4) related to the NIMA (never-in-mitosis) family, members of which
play important roles in mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotic cells. Only one of
these, Pfnek-1, which we previously characterized at the biochemical level, is
expressed in asexual parasites. The other three (Pfnek-2, -3 and -4) are
expressed predominantly in gametocytes, and a role for nek-2 and nek-4 in meiosis
has been documented. Here we show by reverse genetics that Pfnek-1 is required
for completion of the asexual cycle in red blood cells and that its expression in
gametocytes in detectable by immunofluorescence in male (but not in female)
gametocytes, in contrast with Pfnek-2 and Pfnek-4. This indicates that the
function of Pfnek-1 is non-redundant with those of the other members of the Pfnek
family and identifies Pfnek-1 as a potential target for antimalarial
chemotherapy. A medium-throughput screen of a small-molecule library provides
proof of concept that recombinant Pfnek-1 can be used as a target in drug
discovery.
