Plasmodium sporozoites are transmitted from infected mosquitoes to mammals, and
must navigate the host skin and vasculature to infect the liver. This journey
requires distinct proteomes. Here, we report the dynamic transcriptomes and
proteomes of both oocyst sporozoites and salivary gland sporozoites in both
rodent-infectious Plasmodium yoelii parasites and human-infectious Plasmodium
falciparum parasites. The data robustly define mRNAs and proteins that are
upregulated in oocyst sporozoites (UOS) or upregulated in infectious sporozoites 
(UIS) within the salivary glands, including many that are essential for
sporozoite functions in the vector and host. Moreover, we find that malaria
parasites use two overlapping, extensive, and independent programs of
translational repression across sporozoite maturation to temporally regulate
protein expression. Together with gene-specific validation experiments, these
data indicate that two waves of translational repression are implemented and
relieved at different times during sporozoite maturation, migration and
infection, thus promoting their successful development and vector-to-host
transition.
