Technologies based on RNA interference may be used for insect control.
Sustainable strategies are needed to control vectors of Chagas disease such as
Rhodnius prolixus. The insect microbiota can be modified to deliver molecules to 
the gut. Here, Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) expressing dsRNA for the Rhodnius
heme-binding protein (RHBP) and for catalase (CAT) were fed to nymphs and adult
triatomine stages. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT is an antioxidant enzyme
expressed in all tissues by all developmental stages. The RNA interference effect
was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E. coli HT115(DE3) above 3.35 ×
10(7) CFU/mL produced a significant RHBP and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and
adults. RHBP expression in the fat body was reduced by 99% three days after
feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after feeding. CAT expression was
reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and the posterior midgut, respectively, five 
days after ingestion. Mortality rates increased by 24-30% in first instars fed
RHBP and CAT bacteria. Molting rates were reduced by 100% in first instars and
80% in third instars fed bacteria producing RHBP or CAT dsRNA. Oviposition was
reduced by 43% (RHBP) and 84% (CAT). Embryogenesis was arrested in 16% (RHBP) and
20% (CAT) of laid eggs. Feeding females 105 CFU/mL of the natural symbiont,
Rhodococcus rhodnii, transformed to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA reduced
RHBP expression by 89% and reduced oviposition. Modifying the insect microbiota
to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy
for sustainable vector control.
