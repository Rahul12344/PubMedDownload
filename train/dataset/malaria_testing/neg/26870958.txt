INTRODUCTION: Plasmodium vivax malaria has a wide geographic distribution and
poses challenges to malaria elimination that are likely to be greater than those 
of P. falciparum. Diagnostic tools for P. vivax infection in non-reference
laboratory settings are limited to microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests but
these are unreliable at low parasitemia. The development and validation of a
high-throughput and sensitive assay for P. vivax is a priority.
METHODS: A high-throughput LAMP assay targeting a P. vivax mitochondrial gene and
deploying colorimetric detection in a 96-well plate format was developed and
evaluated in the laboratory. Diagnostic accuracy was compared against microscopy,
antigen detection tests and PCR and validated in samples from malaria patients
and community controls in a district hospital setting in Sabah, Malaysia.
RESULTS: The high throughput LAMP-P. vivax assay (HtLAMP-Pv) performed with an
estimated limit of detection of 1.4 parasites/ Î¼L. Assay primers demonstrated
cross-reactivity with P. knowlesi but not with other Plasmodium spp. Field
testing of HtLAMP-Pv was conducted using 149 samples from symptomatic malaria
patients (64 P. vivax, 17 P. falciparum, 56 P. knowlesi, 7 P. malariae, 1 mixed
P. knowlesi/P. vivax, with 4 excluded). When compared against multiplex PCR,
HtLAMP-Pv demonstrated a sensitivity for P. vivax of 95% (95% CI 87-99%); 61/64),
and specificity of 100% (95% CI 86-100%); 25/25) when P. knowlesi samples were
excluded. HtLAMP-Pv testing of 112 samples from asymptomatic community controls, 
7 of which had submicroscopic P. vivax infections by PCR, showed a sensitivity of
71% (95% CI 29-96%; 5/7) and specificity of 93% (95% CI87-97%; 98/105).
CONCLUSION: This novel HtLAMP-P. vivax assay has the potential to be a useful
field applicable molecular diagnostic test for P. vivax infection in elimination 
settings.
