Apicomplexan parasites are leading causes of human and livestock diseases such as
malaria and toxoplasmosis, yet most of their genes remain uncharacterized. Here, 
we present the first genome-wide genetic screen of an apicomplexan. We adapted
CRISPR/Cas9 to assess the contribution of each gene from the parasite Toxoplasma 
gondii during infection of human fibroblasts. Our analysis defines ∼200
previously uncharacterized, fitness-conferring genes unique to the phylum, from
which 16 were investigated, revealing essential functions during infection of
human cells. Secondary screens identify as an invasion factor the claudin-like
apicomplexan microneme protein (CLAMP), which resembles mammalian tight-junction 
proteins and localizes to secretory organelles, making it critical to the
initiation of infection. CLAMP is present throughout sequenced apicomplexan
genomes and is essential during the asexual stages of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum. These results provide broad-based functional information
on T. gondii genes and will facilitate future approaches to expand the horizon of
antiparasitic interventions.
