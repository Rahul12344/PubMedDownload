The genome sequence available for different Plasmodium species is a valuable
resource for understanding malaria parasite biology. However, comparative
genomics on its own cannot fully explain all the species-specific differences
which suggests that other genomic aspects such as regulation of gene expression
play an important role in defining species-specific characteristics. Here, we
developed a comprehensive approach to measure transcriptional changes of the
evolutionary conserved syntenic orthologs during the intraerythrocytic
developmental cycle across six Plasmodium species. We show significant
transcriptional constraint at the mid-developmental stage of Plasmodium species
while the earliest stages of parasite development display the greatest
transcriptional variation associated with critical functional processes. Modeling
of the evolutionary relationship based on changes in transcriptional profile
reveal a phylogeny pattern of the Plasmodium species that strictly follows its
mammalian hosts. In addition, the work shows that transcriptional conserved
orthologs represent potential future targets for anti-malaria intervention as
they would be expected to carry out key essential functions within the parasites.
This work provides an integrated analysis of orthologous transcriptome, which
aims to provide insights into the Plasmodium evolution thereby establishing a
framework to explore complex pathways and drug discovery in Plasmodium species
with broad host range.
