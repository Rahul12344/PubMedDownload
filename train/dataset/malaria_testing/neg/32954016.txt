The progress in gene drive research has made the possibility of a future release 
in the environment probable. This prospect is raising new questions related to
the adequacy of the policy frameworks in place to manage and regulate the
research and its outcomes responsibly. A number of international mechanisms are
exploring how to evaluate this technology. Amongst them, the Convention of
Biological Diversity and the Cartagena Protocol, the review mechanisms of the
World Health Organisation, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature
are offering international fora for dialogue, while regional entities, such as
the African Union, are developing specific frameworks to build their preparedness
for oversight of gene drive organisms. In this manuscript, we review the existing
regulatory landscape around gene drive research and map areas of convergence and 
divergence, as well as gaps in relation to guidelines for community engagement in
gene drive research.

Conflict of interest statement: Competing interests: Delphine Thizy has interests
that might be perceived as competing interests as she is acting as stakeholder
engagement senior advisor for Target Malaria, with a contract from Imperial
College, to work on the development of gene drive technologies to complement
existing tools for malaria control. Isabelle Coche has interests that might be
perceived as competing interests as she provides secretariat services to the
Outreach Network for Gene Drive Research and consultancy services to Imperial
College London to work on the development of gene drive technologies to
complement existing tools for malaria control, as part of the contribution of
Imperial College London to the work of the Target Malaria research consortium.
Jantina de Vries declares no competing interests.
