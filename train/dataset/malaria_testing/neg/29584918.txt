Background: Overcoming antigenic diversity is a key challenge in the development 
of effective Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccines. Strategies that promote the 
generation of antibodies targeting conserved epitopes of vaccine antigens may
provide protection against diverse parasites strains. Understanding differences
between vaccine-induced and naturally acquired immunity is important to achieving
this goal.
Methods: We analyzed antibodies generated in a phase 1 human vaccine trial,
MSP2-C1, which included 2 allelic forms of MSP2, an abundant vaccine antigen on
the merozoite surface. Vaccine-induced responses were assessed for functional
activity against multiple parasite strains, and cross-reactivity of antibodies
was determined using competition ELISA and epitope mapping approaches.
Results: Vaccination induced cytophilic antibody responses with
strain-transcending opsonic phagocytosis and complement-fixing function. In
contrast to antibodies acquired via natural infection, vaccine-induced antibodies
were directed towards conserved epitopes at the C-terminus of MSP2, whereas
naturally acquired antibodies mainly targeted polymorphic epitopes. Functional
activity of C-terminal-targeted antibodies was confirmed using monoclonal
antibodies that promoted opsonic phagocytosis against multiple parasite strains.
Conclusion: Vaccination generated markedly different responses to polymorphic
antigens than naturally acquired immunity and targeted conserved functional
epitopes. Induction of antibodies targeting conserved regions of malaria antigens
provides a promising vaccine strategy to overcome antigenic diversity for
developing effective malaria vaccines.
