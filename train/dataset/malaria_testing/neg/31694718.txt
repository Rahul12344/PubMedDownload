BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostic tests based on histidine-rich protein-2 have
played a vital role in improving malaria case management and surveillance
particularly in Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum is predominant. However,
their usefulness has been threatened by the emergence of gene deletion on P.
falciparum histidine rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) and P. falciparum histidine rich
protein 3 (pfhrp3). Use of standard and recommended methods is key for accurate
investigation, confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to assess the status, methods and
approaches that have been used for investigation, confirmation and reporting of
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion in Africa. An online search was done using PubMed
and MEDLINE Google Scholar for all articles published in English on pfhrp2/3 gene
deletion in Africa. Relevant articles that met the inclusion criteria were
summarized and assessed based on the protocol recommended by the World Health
Organization for confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2/3 gene deletion.
RESULTS: The search identified a total of 18 articles out of which 14 (77.7%)
fulfilled the criteria for inclusion and were retained for review. The articles
were distributed across 12 countries where the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletion
studies were conducted and reported. The level of pfhrp2/3 gene deletion across
selected studies in Africa ranged from the highest 62% to the lowest 0.4%. There 
was wide variation in methods and approaches including study designs, size and
sampling and whether both pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 double deletions or pfhrp2 single
deletion were investigated, with a wide variation in laboratory methods.
CONCLUSION: Based on the review, there is evidence of the presence of pfhrp2/3
gene-deleted P. falciparum parasites in Africa. The approaches and methods used
for investigation, confirmation and reporting of pfhrp2/3 deleted parasites have 
varied between studies and across countries. Countries that are considering plans
to investigate, confirm and report pfhrp2/3 deletion should use recommended
standard and harmonized methods to prevent unnecessary recommendations for costly
switch of RDTs in Africa.
