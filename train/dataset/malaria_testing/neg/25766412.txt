in West Africa is linked to increased expression of multiple gene families.

BACKGROUND: Since 2011, the level of pyrethroid resistance in the major malaria
mosquito, Anopheles coluzzi, has increased to such an extent in Burkina Faso that
none of the long lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) currently in use
throughout the country kill the local mosquito vectors. We investigated whether
this observed increase was associated with transcriptional changes in
field-caught Anopheles coluzzi using two independent whole-genome microarray
studies, performed in 2011 and 2012.
RESULTS: Mosquitoes were collected from south-west Burkina Faso in 2011 and 2012 
and insecticide exposed or non-exposed insects were compared to laboratory
susceptible colonies using whole-genome microarrays. Using a stringent filtering 
process we identified 136 genes, including the well-studied detoxification
enzymes (p450 monoxygenases and esterases) and non-detoxification genes (e.g.
cell transporters and cuticular components), associated with pyrethroid
resistance, whose basal expression level increased during the timeframe of the
study. A subset of these were validated by qPCR using samples from two study
sites, collected over 3 years and marked increases in expression were observed
each year. We hypothesise that these genes are contributing to this rapidly
increasing resistance phenotype in An. coluzzi. A comprehensive analysis of the
knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations (L1014S, L1014F and N1575Y) revealed that
the majority of the resistance phenotype is not explained by target-site
modifications.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the recent and rapid increase in pyrethroid
resistance observed in south-west Burkina Faso is associated with gene expression
profiles described here. Over a third of these candidates are also overexpressed 
in multiple pyrethroid resistant populations of An. coluzzi from neighbouring
Côte d'Ivoire. This suite of molecular markers can be used to track the spread of
the extreme pyrethroid resistance phenotype that is sweeping through West Africa 
and to determine the functional basis of this trait.
