Clinical manifestations in canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) have not been
clearly associated with immunological status or disease progression. We
simultaneously assessed biomarkers of inflammation, immune activation, oxidative 
stress, and anti-sand fly saliva IgG concentrations in dog sera with different
clinical manifestations to characterize a biosignature associated with CVL
severity. In a cross-sectional exploratory study, a random population of 70 dogs 
from an endemic area in Brazil was classified according to CVL clinical severity 
and parasitological evaluation. A panel of biomarkers and anti-sand fly saliva
IgG were measured in canine sera. Assessment of protein expression of profile
biomarkers identified a distinct biosignature that could cluster separately
animal groups with different clinical scores. Increasing severity scores were
associated with a gradual decrease of LTB4 and PGE2, and a gradual increase in
CXCL1 and CCL2. Discriminant analyses revealed that combined assessment of LTB4, 
PGE2 and CXCL1 was able to distinguish dogs with different clinical scores. Dogs 
with the highest clinical score values also exhibited high parasite loads and
higher concentrations of anti-saliva antibodies. Our findings suggest CVL
clinical severity is tightly associated with a distinct inflammatory profile
hallmarked by a differential expression of circulating eicosanoids and
chemokines.
