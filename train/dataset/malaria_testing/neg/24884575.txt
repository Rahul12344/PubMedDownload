BACKGROUND: Transgenic constructs intended to be stably established at high
frequencies in wild populations have been demonstrated to "drive" from low
frequencies in experimental insect populations. Linking such population
transformation constructs to genes which render them unable to transmit pathogens
could eventually be used to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria
and dengue.
RESULTS: Generally, population transformation constructs with only a single
transgenic drive mechanism have been envisioned. Using a theoretical modelling
approach we describe the predicted properties of a construct combining autosomal 
Medea and underdominant population transformation systems. We show that when
combined they can exhibit synergistic properties which in broad circumstances
surpass those of the single systems.
CONCLUSION: With combined systems, intentional population transformation and its 
reversal can be achieved readily. Combined constructs also enhance the capacity
to geographically restrict transgenic constructs to targeted populations. It is
anticipated that these properties are likely to be of particular value in
attracting regulatory approval and public acceptance of this novel technology.
