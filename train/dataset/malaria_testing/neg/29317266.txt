Earlier studies on Plasmodium apoptosis revealed the presence of proteases with
caspases like- activity, which are known as "metacaspases". Although this family 
of cysteine proteases is structurally similar to caspases with Cys-His dyad but
their evolutionary significance and functional relevance remains largely unknown.
These proteases are considered to be an important target against malaria due to
their absence in humans. In this report, we have biochemically characterized
metacaspase-2 (PfMCA-2) of P.falciparum. Enzymatic assay showed that PfMCA-2
efficiently cleaved arginine/lysine specific peptide, but not caspase-specific
substrate. Consistently, PfMCA-2 activity was sensitive to effector caspases
inhibitor, Z-FA-FMK, and mildly inhibited by aprotinin and E-64. However, general
caspase inhibitors such as Z-VAD-FMK and Z-DEVD-FMK had no effect on PfMCA-2
activity. Z-FA-FMK inhibits parasite growth with an IC50 value of 2.7 μM along
with the notable morphological changes. PfMCA-2 specifically expressed in
schizonts and gametocyte stages and there was a notable depletion of PfMCA-2
expression in Z-FA-FMK treated schizonts and gametocytes stages of parasite.
Notably, PfMCA-2 cleaves a phylogenetically conserved protein, TSN (Tudor
staphylococcal nuclease) and the proteolysis of PfTSN did not occur after
treatment with the Z-FA-FMK. The production of large amount of reactive oxygen
species in presence of Z-FA-FMK caused oxidative stress which in turn leads to
loss of cell viability. The oxidative stress further generates positive feedback 
for the occurrence of cell death in term of phosphatidylserine externalization
and DNA fragmentation in vitro.
