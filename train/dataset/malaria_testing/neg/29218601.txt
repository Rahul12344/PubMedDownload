Hematopoiesis is hierarchically orchestrated by a very small population of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that reside in the bone-marrow niche and are
tightly regulated to maintain homeostatic blood production. HSCs are
predominantly quiescent, but they enter the cell cycle in response to
inflammatory signals evoked by severe systemic infection or injury. Thus,
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can be activated by pathogen
recognition receptors and proinflammatory cytokines to induce emergency
myelopoiesis during infection. This emergency myelopoiesis counterbalances the
loss of cells and generates lineage-restricted hematopoietic progenitors,
eventually replenishing mature myeloid cells to control the infection. Controlled
generation of such signals effectively augments host defense, but dysregulated
stimulation by these signals is harmful to HSPCs. Such hematopoietic failure
often results in blood disorders including chronic inflammatory diseases and
hematological malignancies. Recently, we found that interleukin (IL)-27, one of
the IL-6/IL-12 family cytokines, has a unique ability to directly act on HSCs and
promote their expansion and differentiation into myeloid progenitors. This
process resulted in enhanced production of neutrophils by emergency myelopoiesis 
during the blood-stage mouse malaria infection. In this review, we summarize
recent advances in the regulation of myelopoiesis by proinflammatory cytokines
including type I and II interferons, IL-6, IL-27, granulocyte colony-stimulating 
factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-1 in infectious diseases.
