In malaria parasites, the systematic experimental validation of drug and vaccine 
targets by reverse genetics is constrained by the inefficiency of homologous
recombination and by the difficulty of manipulating adenine and thymine
(A+T)-rich DNA of most Plasmodium species in Escherichia coli. We overcame these 
roadblocks by creating a high-integrity library of Plasmodium berghei genomic DNA
(>77% A+T content) in a bacteriophage N15-based vector that can be modified
efficiently using the lambda Red method of recombineering. We built a pipeline
for generating P. berghei genetic modification vectors at genome scale in serial 
liquid cultures on 96-well plates. Vectors have long homology arms, which
increase recombination frequency up to tenfold over conventional designs. The
feasibility of efficient genetic modification at scale will stimulate
collaborative, genome-wide knockout and tagging programs for P. berghei.
