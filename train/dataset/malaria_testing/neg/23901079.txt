Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) antigens mediate
parasite sequestration and host immune evasion. Reactivity to 21 PfEMP1 fragments
on a protein microarray was measured in serum samples from Malian children aged
1-6 years and adults. Seroreactivity to PfEMP1 fragments was higher in adults
than in children; intracellular conserved fragments were more widely recognized
than were extracellular hypervariable fragments. Over a malaria season, children 
maintained this differential seroreactivity and recognized additional
intracellular PfEMP1 fragments. This approach has the potential to identify
conserved, seroreactive extracellular PfEMP1 domains critical for protective
immunity to malaria.
