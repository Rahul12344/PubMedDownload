BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has considerable effects on the pharmacokinetic properties 
of drugs used to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The role of
pharmacogenetic variation on anti-malarial drug disposition and efficacy during
pregnancy is not well investigated. The study aimed to examine the effect of
pharmacogenetics on lumefantrine (LF) pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in
pregnant women.
METHODS: Pregnant women with uncomplicated falciparum malaria were enrolled and
treated with artemether-lumefantrine (ALu) at Mkuranga and Kisarawe district
hospitals in Coast Region of Tanzania. Day-7 LF plasma concentration and
genotyping forCYP2B6 (c.516G>T, c.983T>C), CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5 (*3, *6, *7) and
ABCB1 c.4036A4G were determined. Blood smear for parasite quantification by
microscopy, and dried blood spot for parasite screening and genotyping using qPCR
and nested PCR were collected at enrolment up to day 28 to differentiate between 
reinfection from recrudescence. Treatment response was recorded following the WHO
protocol.
RESULTS: In total, 92 pregnant women in their second and third trimester were
included in the study and 424 samples were screened for presence of P.
falciparum. Parasites were detected during the follow up period in 11 (12%) women
between day 7 and 28 after treatment and PCR genotyping confirmed recrudescent
infection in 7 (63.3%) women. The remaining four (36.4%) pregnant women had
reinfection: one on day 14 and three on day 28. The overall PCR-corrected
treatment failure rate was 9.0% (95% CI 4.4-17.4). Day 7 LF concentration was not
significantly influenced by CYP2B6, CYP3A4*1B and ABCB1 c.4036A>G genotypes.
Significant associations between CYP3A5 genotype and day 7 plasma LF
concentrations was found, being higher in carriers of CYP3A5 defective variant
alleles than CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype. No significant influence of CYP2B6, CYP3A5 and
ABCB1 c.4036A>Genotypes on malaria treatment outcome were observed. However,
CYP3A4*1B did affect malaria treatment outcome in pregnant women followed up for 
28 days (P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in CYP3A4 and CYP3A5may influence LF
pharmacokinetics and treatment outcome in pregnant women.
