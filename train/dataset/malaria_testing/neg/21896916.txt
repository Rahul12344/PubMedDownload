Molecular markers for surveillance of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to current
antimalarials are sorely needed. A 28-day efficacy study of
artemether-lumefantrine in eastern Sudan identified 5 treatment failures among
100 evaluable patients; 9 further individuals were parasite positive by PCR
during follow-up. Polymorphisms in pfatpase6 and pfmdr1 were evaluated by DNA
sequencing. One individual carried parasites with a novel pfmdr1 polymorphism
(F1044L). pfmdr1 gene amplification in parasites prior to treatment occurred in
three individuals who had recurrent infection during follow-up.
