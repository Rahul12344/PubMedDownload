BACKGROUND: Sri Lanka has achieved 'malaria-free' status and is now in the phase 
of prevention of re-introduction of malaria. Imported malaria remains a challenge
to resurgence of the disease. The diagnostic challenges encountered and the rapid
response initiated to manage a Plasmodium infection, which was later confirmed as
Plasmodium knowlesi, the first reported case from Sri Lanka, is discussed.
CASE PRESENTATION: An army officer who returned from Malaysia in October 2016 was
found to be positive for Plasmodium both by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test 
(RDT) by the Anti Malaria Campaign Sri Lanka (AMC) during his third visit to a
health care provider. Microscopy findings were suspicious of P. knowlesi
infection as the smears showed parasite stages similar to both Plasmodium
malariae and Plasmodium falciparum. Nested PCR at AMC confirmed Plasmodium genus,
but not the species. In the absence of species confirmation, the patient was
treated as a case of P. falciparum. The presence of P. knowlesi was later
confirmed by a semi-nested PCR assay performed at the Environmental Health
Institute, National Environmental Agency in Singapore. The parasite strain was
also characterized by sequencing the circumsporozoite gene. Extensive case
investigation including parasitological and entomological surveillance was
carried out.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmodium knowlesi should be suspected in patients returning from
countries in the South Asian region where the parasite is prevalent and when
blood smear results are inconclusive.
