An influx of immigrants is contributing to the reemergence of Plasmodium vivax
malaria in Greece; 1 persistent focus of transmission is in Laconia, Pelopónnese.
We genotyped archived blood samples from a substantial proportion of malaria
cases recorded in Greece in 2009-2013 using 8 microsatellite markers and a
PvMSP-3α gene fragment and plotted their spatiotemporal distribution. High
parasite genetic diversity with low multiplicity of infection was observed. A
subset of genetically identical/related parasites was restricted to 3 areas in
migrants and Greek residents, with some persisting over 2 consecutive
transmission periods. We identified 2 hitherto unsuspected additional foci of
local transmission: Kardhítsa and Attica. Furthermore, this analysis indicates
that several cases in migrants initially classified as imported malaria were
actually locally acquired. This study shows the potential for P. vivax to
reestablish transmission and counsels public health authorities about the need
for vigilance to achieve or maintain sustainable malaria elimination.
