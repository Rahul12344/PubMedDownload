BACKGROUND: Fruit flies and mammals protect themselves against infection by
mounting immune and metabolic responses that must be balanced against the
metabolic needs of the pathogens. In this context, p38 mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK)-dependent signaling is critical to regulating both innate immunity 
and metabolism during infection. Accordingly, we asked to what extent the Asian
malaria mosquito Anopheles stephensi utilizes p38 MAPK signaling during infection
with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
METHODS: A. stephensi p38 MAPK (AsP38 MAPK) was identified and patterns of
signaling in vitro and in vivo (midgut) were analyzed using phospho-specific
antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. Functional effects of AsP38 MAPK
inhibition were assessed using P. falciparum infection, quantitative real-time
PCR, assays for reactive oxygen species and survivorship under oxidative stress, 
proteomics, and biochemical analyses.
RESULTS: The genome of A. stephensi encodes a single p38 MAPK that is activated
in the midgut in response to parasite infection. Inhibition of AsP38 MAPK
signaling significantly reduced P. falciparum sporogonic development. This
phenotype was associated with AsP38 MAPK regulation of mitochondrial physiology
and stress responses in the midgut epithelium, a tissue critical for parasite
development. Specifically, inhibition of AsP38 MAPK resulted in reduction in
mosquito protein synthesis machinery, a shift in glucose metabolism, reduced
mitochondrial metabolism, enhanced production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species, induction of an array of anti-parasite effector genes, and decreased
resistance to oxidative stress-mediated damage. Hence, P. falciparum-induced
activation of AsP38 MAPK in the midgut facilitates parasite infection through a
combination of reduced anti-parasite immune defenses and enhanced host protein
synthesis and bioenergetics to minimize the impact of infection on the host and
to maximize parasite survival, and ultimately, transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that, as in mammals, innate immunity and 
mitochondrial responses are integrated in mosquitoes and that AsP38
MAPK-dependent signaling facilitates mosquito survival during parasite infection,
a fact that may attest to the relatively longer evolutionary relationship of
these parasites with their invertebrate compared to their vertebrate hosts. On a 
practical level, improved understanding of the balances and trade-offs between
resistance and metabolism could be leveraged to generate fit, resistant
mosquitoes for malaria control.
