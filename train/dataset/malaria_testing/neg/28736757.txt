Erythrocytes infected malaria parasites have increased permeability to nutrients 
and other solutes, as mediated by an unusual ion channel known as the plasmodial 
surface anion channel (PSAC). Although the increased permeability of infected
erythrocytes was identified more than 70 years ago and subsequently characterized
with tracer studies, its mechanism and role in parasite biology remained unclear 
until the introduction of patch-clamp methods and high-throughput screening
technologies. These methods discovered and implicated PSAC as the primary
mechanism, determined that this channel is essential for parasite development,
led to identification of the channel's genes, and stimulated antimalarial drug
discovery against this target. Despite these advances, many questions remain
about this unusual parasite channel. Our review highlights some recent advances
and describes important questions for future research.
