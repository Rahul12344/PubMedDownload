BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP-1) plays a role in
the formation of the parasitophorous vacuole following the parasite's invasion of
red blood cells. Although there is some evidence that the protein is recognized
by the host's immune system, study of Plasmodium falciparum RAP-1 (PfRAP-1)
suggests that it is not under immune pressure. A previous study on five old
(1953-1962) P. knowlesi strains suggested that RAP-1 has limited genetic
polymorphism and might be under negative selection. In the present study, 30
recent P. knowlesi isolates were studied to obtain a better insight into the
polymorphism and natural selection of PkRAP-1.
METHODS: Blood samples from 30 knowlesi malaria patients were used. These samples
were collected between 2010 and 2014. The PkRAP-1 gene, which contains two exons,
was amplified by PCR, cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. Genetic
diversity and phylogenetic analyses were performed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver.
5.10.00 programs.
RESULTS: Thirty PkRAP-1 sequences were obtained. The nucleotide diversity (Ï€) of 
exons 1, 2 and the total coding region (0.00915, 0.01353 and 0.01298,
respectively) were higher than those of the old strains. Further analysis
revealed a lower rate of non-synonymous (dN) than synonymous (dS) mutations,
suggesting negative (purifying) selection of PkRAP-1. Tajima's D test and Fu and 
Li's D test values were not significant. At the amino acid level, 22 haplotypes
were established with haplotype H7 having the highest frequency (7/34, 20.5 %).
In the phylogenetic analysis, two distinct haplotype groups were observed. The
first group contained the majority of the haplotypes, whereas the second had
fewer haplotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study found higher genetic polymorphism in the PkRAP-1
gene than the polymorphism level reported in a previous study. This observation
may stem from the difference in sample size between the present (n = 30) and the 
previous (n = 5) study. Synonymous and non-synonymous mutation analysis indicated
purifying (negative) selection of the gene. The separation of PkRAP-1haplotypes
into two groups provides further evidence to the postulation of two distinct P.
knowlesi types or lineages.
