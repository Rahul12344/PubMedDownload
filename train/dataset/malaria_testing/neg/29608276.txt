Replacement of wild insect populations with transgene-bearing individuals unable 
to transmit disease or survive under specific environmental conditions using gene
drive provides a self-perpetuating method of disease prevention. Mechanisms that 
require the gene drive element and linked cargo to exceed a high threshold
frequency in order for spread to occur are attractive because they offer several 
points of control: they bring about local, but not global population replacement;
and transgenes can be eliminated by reintroducing wildtypes into the population
so as to drive the frequency of transgenes below the threshold frequency required
for drive. Reciprocal chromosome translocations were proposed as a tool for
bringing about high threshold population replacement in 1940 and 1968. However,
translocations able to achieve this goal have only been reported once, in the
spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a haplo-diploid species in which there is strong
selection in haploid males for fit homozygotes. We report the creation of
engineered translocation-bearing strains of Drosophila melanogaster, generated
through targeted chromosomal breakage and homologous recombination. These strains
drive high threshold population replacement in laboratory populations. While it
remains to be shown that engineered translocations can bring about population
replacement in wild populations, these observations suggest that further
exploration of engineered translocations as a tool for controlled population
replacement is warranted.
