Gene drive technology has immense potential. The ability to bypass the laws of
Mendelian inheritance and almost ensure the transmission of specific genetic
material to future generations creates boundless possibilities. But alongside
these boundless possibilities are major social and ethical issues. This article
aims to introduce gene drive technology, some of its potential applications, and 
some of the social and ethical issues that arise during research into the
technology. For example, is investigation into gene drives hubristic? Would
applications of gene drives count as technological fixes? Or does research into
such a technology sit on a slippery slope or lock us in to its full-scale use?
Are there perverse effects of engaging in research, and, most importantly, who
ought to be included in the decision-making process regarding research and field 
trials? Understanding the basic ethical landscape of this technology will prove
invaluable to the public, scientists, and policy-makers as research moves
forward.
