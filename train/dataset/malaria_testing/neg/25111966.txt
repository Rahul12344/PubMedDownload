RecQ DNA gene of multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum K1 (PfRecQ1) was
cloned, and the recombinant C-terminal-decahistidine-tagged PfRecQ1 was expressed
in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme could efficiently unwind partial duplex 
DNA substrate in a 3' to 5' direction. The malarial RecQ1 could not unwind
substrates with both 5' and 3' overhangs, those with a 5' overhang, or
blunt-ended DNA duplexes. Unwinding of DNA helicase activity was driven by the
hydrolysis of ATP. The drug inhibitory effects of six compounds indicated that
only doxorubicin and daunorubicin could inhibit the unwinding activity.
