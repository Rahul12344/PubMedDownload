A Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strain, Braz8T, isolated from larvae of
Anopheles darlingi was investigated using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic
analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Braz8T was related
most closely to species of the genus Thorsellia, with 95.6, 96.5 and 96.6 %
similarity to the type strains of Thorsellia anophelis, Thorsellia kandunguensis 
and Thorsellia kenyensis, respectively, and formed a separate branch in the
phylogenetic tree next to the monophyletic cluster of the genus Thorsellia.
Chemotaxonomic data supported the allocation of the strain to the family
Thorselliaceae. The major fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0 and C14 : 0. The
quinone system was composed of ubiquinones Q-8 and Q-7 (1 : 0.3), the predominant
polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, and the
polyamine pattern showed the major compound putrescine. However, qualitative and 
quantitative differences in the major polyamine, polar lipid profile and fatty
acid patterns distinguished strain Braz8T from species of the genus Thorsellia.
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, average nucleotide
identity, DNA-DNA hybridization, multilocus sequence analysis as well as
physiological and biochemical tests distinguished strain Braz8T both
genotypically and phenotypically from the three Thorsellia species but also
showed its placement in the family Thorselliaceae. Thus, strain Braz8T is
considered to represent a novel species of a new genus most closely related to
the genus Thorsellia, for which the name Coetzeea brasiliensis gen. nov., sp.
nov. is proposed. The type strain of Coetzeea brasiliensis is Braz8T (=LMG
29552T=CIP 111088T).
