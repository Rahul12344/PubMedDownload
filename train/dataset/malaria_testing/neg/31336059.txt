Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) target the sexual stages of malarial
parasites to interrupt or reduce the transmission cycle have been one of
approaches to control malaria. Pvs25 and Pvs28 are the leading candidate antigens
of TBVs against vivax malaria. In this study, genetic diversity and natural
selection of the two TBV candidate genes in Plasmodium vivax Myanmar isolates
were analyzed. The 62 Myanmar P. vivax isolates showed 9 and 19 different
haplotypes for Pvs25 and Pvs28, respectively. The nucleotide diversity of Pvs28
was slightly higher than Pvs25, but not significant. Most amino acid
substitutions observed in Myanmar Pvs25 and Pvs28 were concentrated at the EGF-2 
and EGF-3 like domains. Major amino acid changes found in Myanmar Pvs25 and Pvs28
were similar to those reported in the global population, but novel amino acid
substitutions were also identified. Negative selection was predicted in Myanmar
Pvs25, whereas Pvs28 was under positive selection. Comparative analysis of global
Pvs25 and Pvs28 suggests a substantial geographical difference between the Asian 
and American/African Pvs25 and Pvs28. The geographical genetic differentiation
and the evidence for natural selection in global Pvs25 and Pvs28 suggest that the
functional consequences of the observed polymorphism need to be considered for
the development of effective TBVs based on the antigens.
