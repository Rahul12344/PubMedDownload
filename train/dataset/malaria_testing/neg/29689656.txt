OBJECTIVE: To analyze the transcription pattern of neuropeptides in the ontogeny 
of a malaria vector, the mosquito Anopheles albimanus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The transcription pattern of Crustacean CardioActive
peptide (CCAP), corazonin, Ecdysis Triggering Hormone (ETH), allatostatin-A,
orcokinin, Insulin Like Peptide 2 (ILP2), Insulin Like Peptide 5 (ILP5) and
bursicon was evaluated using qPCR on larvae (1st - 4th instar), pupae and adult
mosquitoes.
RESULTS: Unlike in other insects, transcripts of CCAP (70.8%), ETH (60.2%) and
corazonin (76.5%) were expressed in 4th instar larvae, probably because these
three neuropeptides are associated with the beginning of ecdysis. The
neuropeptide ILP2 showed higher transcription levels in other stages and
orcokinin decreased during the development of the mosquito.
CONCLUSIONS: The CCAP, corazonin and ETH neuropeptidesare potential targets for
the design of control strategies aimed at disrupting An. albiamnus larval
development.
