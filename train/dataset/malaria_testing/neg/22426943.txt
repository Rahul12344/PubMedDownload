The global spread of drug-resistant parasites is a serious problem for the
treatment of malaria. Although identifying drug-resistance genes is crucial for
the efforts against resistant parasites, an effective approach has not yet been
developed. Here, we report a robust method for identifying resistance genes from 
parasites by using a Plasmodium artificial chromosome (PAC). Large genomic DNA
fragments (10-50 kb) from the drug-resistant rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium
berghei were ligated into the PAC and directly introduced into the drug-sensitive
(i.e., wild-type) parasite by electroporation, resulting in a PAC library that
encompassed the whole genomic sequence of the parasite. Subsequently, the
transformed parasites that acquired resistance were selected by screening with
the drug, and the resistance gene in the PAC was successfully identified.
Furthermore, the drug-resistance gene was identified from a PAC library that was 
made from the pyrimethamine-resistant parasite Plasmodium chabaudi, further
demonstrating the utility of our method. This method will promote the
identification of resistance genes and contribute to the global fight against
drug-resistant parasites.
