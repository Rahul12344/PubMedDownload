Little is known about stage-specific gene regulation in Plasmodium parasites, in 
particular the liver stage of development. We have previously described in the
Plasmodium berghei rodent model, a liver stage-specific (lisp2) gene promoter
region, in vitro. Using a dual luminescence system, we now confirm the stage
specificity of this promoter region also in vivo. Furthermore, by substitution
and deletion analyses we have extended our in vitro characterization of important
elements within the promoter region. Importantly, the dual luminescence system
allows analyzing promoter constructs avoiding mouse-consuming cloning procedures 
of transgenic parasites. This makes extensive mutation and deletion studies a
reasonable approach also in the malaria mouse model. Stage-specific expression
constructs and parasite lines are extremely valuable tools for research on
Plasmodium liver stage biology. Such reporter lines offer a promising opportunity
for assessment of liver stage drugs, characterization of genetically attenuated
parasites and liver stage-specific vaccines both in vivo and in vitro, and may be
key for the generation of inducible systems.
