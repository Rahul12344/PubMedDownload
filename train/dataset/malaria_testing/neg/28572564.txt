Plasmacytoid dendritic cells appear inactive during sub-microscopic Plasmodium
falciparum blood-stage infection, yet retain their ability to respond to TLR
stimulation.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are activators of innate and adaptive immune
responses that express HLA-DR, toll-like receptor (TLR) 7, TLR9 and produce type 
I interferons. The role of human pDC in malaria remains poorly characterised. pDC
activation and cytokine production were assessed in 59 malaria-naive volunteers
during experimental infection with 150 or 1,800 P. falciparum-parasitized red
blood cells. Using RNA sequencing, longitudinal changes in pDC gene expression
were examined in five adults before and at peak-infection. pDC responsiveness to 
TLR7 and TLR9 stimulation was assessed in-vitro. Circulating pDC remained
transcriptionally stable with gene expression altered for 8 genes (FDR < 0.07).
There was no upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules CD86, CD80, CD40, and
reduced surface expression of HLA-DR and CD123 (IL-3R-α). pDC loss from the
circulation was associated with active caspase-3, suggesting pDC apoptosis during
primary infection. pDC remained responsive to TLR stimulation, producing IFN-α
and upregulating HLA-DR, CD86, CD123 at peak-infection. In clinical malaria, pDC 
retained HLA-DR but reduced CD123 expression compared to convalescence. These
data demonstrate pDC retain function during a first blood-stage P. falciparum
exposure despite sub-microscopic parasitaemia downregulating HLA-DR. The lack of 
evident pDC activation in both early infection and malaria suggests little
response of circulating pDC to infection.
