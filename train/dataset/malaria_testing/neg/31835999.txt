BACKGROUND: Transcriptional profiling of the human immune response to malaria has
been used to identify diagnostic markers, understand the pathogenicity of severe 
disease and dissect the mechanisms of naturally acquired immunity (NAI). However,
interpreting this body of work is difficult given considerable variation in study
design, definition of disease, patient selection and methodology employed. This
work details a comprehensive review of gene expression profiling (GEP) of the
human immune response to malaria to determine how this technology has been
applied to date, instances where this has advanced understanding of NAI and the
extent of variability in methodology between studies to allow informed comparison
of data and interpretation of results.
METHODS: Datasets from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) including the search
terms; 'plasmodium' or 'malaria' or 'sporozoite' or 'merozoite' or 'gametocyte'
and 'Homo sapiens' were identified and publications analysed. Datasets of gene
expression changes in relation to malaria vaccines were excluded.
RESULTS: Twenty-three GEO datasets and 25 related publications were included in
the final review. All datasets related to Plasmodium falciparum infection, except
two that related to Plasmodium vivax infection. The majority of datasets included
samples from individuals infected with malaria 'naturally' in the field (n = 13, 
57%), however some related to controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) studies
(n = 6, 26%), or cells stimulated with Plasmodium in vitro (n = 6, 26%). The
majority of studies examined gene expression changes relating to the blood stage 
of the parasite. Significant heterogeneity between datasets was identified in
terms of study design, sample type, platform used and method of analysis. Seven
datasets specifically investigated transcriptional changes associated with NAI to
malaria, with evidence supporting suppression of the innate pro-inflammatory
response as an important mechanism for this in the majority of these studies.
However, further interpretation of this body of work was limited by heterogeneity
between studies and small sample sizes.
CONCLUSIONS: GEP in malaria is a potentially powerful tool, but to date studies
have been hypothesis generating with small sample sizes and widely varying
methodology. As CHMI studies are increasingly performed in endemic settings,
there will be growing opportunity to use GEP to understand detailed time-course
changes in host response and understand in greater detail the mechanisms of NAI.
