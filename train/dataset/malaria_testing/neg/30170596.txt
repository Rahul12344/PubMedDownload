BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a public health problem in some countries of Central 
America. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are one of the most useful tools to assist
in the diagnosis of malaria in remote areas. Since its introduction, a wide
variety of RDTs have been developed for the detection of different parasite
antigens. PfHRP2 is the most targeted antigen for the detection of Plasmodium
falciparum infections. Genetic mutations and gene deletions are important factors
influencing or affecting the performance of rapid diagnostic tests.
METHODS: In order to demonstrate the presence or absence of the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3
genes and their flanking regions, a total of 128 blood samples from patients with
P. falciparum infection from three Central American countries were analysed
through nested or semi-nested PCR approaches.
RESULTS: In total, 25.8 and 91.4% of the isolates lacked the region located
between exon 1 and exon 2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, respectively. Parasites
from the three countries showed deletions of one or both genes. The highest
proportion of pfhrp2 deletions was found in Nicaragua while the isolates from
Guatemala revealed the lowest number of pfhrp2 deletions. Parasites collected
from Honduras showed the highest proportion of phfrp3 absence (96.2%). Twenty-one
percent of isolates were double negative mutants for the exon 1-2 segment of both
genes, and 6.3% of isolates lacked the full-length coding region of both genes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides molecular evidence of the existence of P.
falciparum isolates lacking the pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, and their flanking
regions, in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. This finding could hinder progress
in the control and elimination of malaria in Central America. Continuous
evaluation of RDTs and molecular surveillance would be recommended.
