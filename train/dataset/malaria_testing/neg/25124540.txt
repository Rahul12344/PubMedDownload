BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ), encoded by
TNF-836 C/A (rs 1800630) and IFN-γ -1616 C/T (rs2069705) genes, are key
immunological mediators that are believed to both play protective and
pathological roles in malaria. The aim of this study was to investigate the
relationship between TNF-836 C/A and IFN-γ-1616 C/T polymorphism and
susceptibility to severe malaria in pregnant women.
METHODS: A prospective cohort (cross-sectional) study was conducted in pregnant
women attending the out-patient clinic in King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Jazan
(KFSHJ), with a clinical diagnosis of malaria. A total of one hundred and eighty 
six pregnant women were genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) for
TNF and IFN-γ using Taqman® MGB Probes. Serum cytokine concentrations were
measured by sandwich ELISA method.
RESULTS: A hospital case-control study of severe malaria in a Saudi population
identified strong associations with individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
the TNF and IFN-γ genes, and defined TNF-836 C and IFN-γ-1616 T genotypes and
alleles which were statistically significantly associated with severe malaria
infection. Furthermore, TNF-836 CC and IFN-γ-1616 TT genotypes were associated
with higher serum concentration of TNF and IFN-γ, respectively, and with
susceptibility to severe malaria.
CONCLUSIONS: This data provides a starting point for functional and genetic
analysis of the TNF and IFN-γ genomic region in malaria infection affecting Saudi
populations.
