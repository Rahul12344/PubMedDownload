Extracellular hemoglobin, a byproduct of hemolysis, can release its prosthetic
heme groups upon oxidation. This produces metabolically active heme that is
exchangeable between acceptor proteins, macromolecules and low molecular weight
ligands, termed here labile heme. As it accumulates in plasma labile heme acts in
a pro-oxidant manner and regulates cellular metabolism while exerting
pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects that foster the pathogenesis of hemolytic 
diseases. Here, we developed and characterized a panel of heme-specific single
domain antibodies (sdAbs) that together with a cellular-based heme reporter
assay, allow for quantification and characterization of labile heme in plasma
during hemolytic conditions. Using these approaches, we demonstrate that when
generated during hemolytic conditions labile heme is bound to plasma molecules
with an affinity higher than 10-7 m and that 2-8% (~ 2-5 μm) of the total amount 
of heme detected in plasma can be internalized by bystander cells, termed here
bioavailable heme. Acute, but not chronic, hemolysis is associated with transient
reduction of plasma heme-binding capacity, that is, the ability of plasma
molecules to bind labile heme with an affinity higher than 10-7 m. The
heme-specific sdAbs neutralize the pro-oxidant activity of soluble heme in vitro,
suggesting that these maybe used to counter the pathologic effects of labile heme
during hemolytic conditions. Finally, we show that heme-specific sdAbs can be
used to visualize cellular heme. In conclusion, we describe a panel of
heme-specific sdAbs that when used with other approaches provide novel insights
to the pathophysiology of heme.
