In this study, we investigated the mutation tendency of a mutator rodent malaria 
parasite, Plasmodium berghei, with proofreading-deficient DNA polymerase δ.
Wild-type and mutator parasites were maintained in mice for over 24 weeks, and
the genome-wide accumulated mutations were determined by high-throughput
sequencing. The mutator P. berghei had a significant preference for C/G to A/T
substitutions; thus, its genome had a trend towards a higher AT content. The
mutation rate was influenced by the sequence context, and mutations were markedly
elevated at TCT. Some genes mutated repeatedly in replicate passage lines. In
particular, knockout mutations of the AP2-G gene were frequent, which conferred
strong growth advantages on parasites during the blood stage but at the cost of
losing the ability to form gametocytes. This is the first report to demonstrate a
biased mutation tendency in malaria parasites, and its results help to promote
our basic understanding of Plasmodium genetics.
