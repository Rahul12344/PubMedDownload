OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility status of malaria vectors to pyrethroids 
and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), characterise the mechanisms underlying
resistance and evaluate the role of agro-chemical use in resistance selection
among malaria vectors in Sengerema agro-ecosystem zone, Tanzania.
METHODS: Mosquito larvae were collected from farms and reared to obtain adults.
The susceptibility status of An. gambiae s.l. was assessed using WHO bioassay
tests to permethrin, deltamethrin, lambdacyhalothrin, etofenprox, cyfluthrin and 
DDT. Resistant specimens were screened for knock-down resistance gene (kdr),
followed by sequencing both Western and Eastern African variants. A gas
chromatography-mass spectrophotometer (GC-MS) was used to determine pesticide
residues in soil and sediments from mosquitoes' breeding habitats.
RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.l. was resistant to all the insecticides tested. The
population of Anopheles gambiae s.l was composed of Anopheles arabiensis by 91%. 
The East African kdr (L1014S) allele was found in 13 of 305 specimens that
survived insecticide exposure, with an allele frequency from 0.9% to 50%. DDTs
residues were found in soils at a concentration up to 9.90 ng/g (dry weight).
CONCLUSION: The observed high resistance levels of An. gambiae s.l., the
detection of kdr mutations and pesticide residues in mosquito breeding habitats
demonstrate vector resistance mediated by pesticide usage. An integrated
intervention through collaboration of agricultural, livestock and vector control 
units is vital.
