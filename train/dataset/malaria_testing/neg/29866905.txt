Transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) interrupting malaria transmission are an
integrated tool for malaria eradication. We characterized a sexual-stage-specific
gene (PBANKA_060330) from Plasmodium berghei and studied its potential for use as
a TBV. This gene, referred to as pbg37, encodes a protein of 37 kDa with a signal
peptide and multiple transmembrane domains and is preferentially expressed in
gametocytes. A recombinant Pbg37 (rPbg37) protein targeting the N-terminal 63
amino acids (amino acids 26 to 88) expressed in bacteria elicited strong antibody
responses in mice. Western blotting demonstrated Pbg37 expression in gametocytes,
zygotes, and, to a lesser extent, ookinetes and its predominant association with 
the membranes of gametocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence assay showed an
abundant surface localization of Pbg37 on gametes and zygotes but reduced amounts
on retorts and ookinetes. Knockout of pbg37 (Δpbg37) led to a considerable
reduction in gametocytemia, which translated into a ~92.1% decrease in the oocyst
number in mosquitoes. Deletion of pbg37 had a more substantial influence on the
development and maturation of microgametocytes. As a result, the Δpbg37 lines
exhibited a higher female/male gametocyte ratio, fewer mature male gametocytes,
and defects in the exflagellation of mature microgametocytes. To test the
transmission-blocking potential of Pbg37, an in vitro ookinete assay showed that 
the major inhibitory effects of anti-Pbg37 antiserum were on the exflagellation
and fertilization processes. Direct feeding of mosquitoes on mice immunized with 
rPbg37 or a control protein showed that rPbg37-immunized and P. berghei-infected 
mice had a significant reduction (49.1%) in oocyst density compared to the
controls. The conservation of this gene in Plasmodium warrants further
investigations in human malaria parasites.
