Anopheles stephensi is a principal vector of urban malaria on the Indian
subcontinent and an emerging model for molecular and genetic studies of mosquito 
biology. To enhance our understanding of female mosquito reproduction, and to
develop new tools for basic research and for genetic strategies to control
mosquito-borne infectious diseases, we identified 79 genes that displayed
previtellogenic germline-specific expression based on RNA-Seq data generated from
11 life stage-specific and sex-specific samples. Analysis of this gene set
provided insights into the biology and evolution of female reproduction.
Promoters from two of these candidates, vitellogenin receptor and nanos, were
used in independent transgenic cassettes for the expression of artificial
microRNAs against suspected mosquito maternal-effect genes, discontinuous actin
hexagon and myd88. We show these promoters have early germline-specific
expression and demonstrate 73% and 42% knockdown of myd88 and discontinuous actin
hexagon mRNA in ovaries 48 hr after blood meal, respectively. Additionally, we
demonstrate maternal-specific delivery of mRNA and protein to progeny embryos. We
discuss the application of this system of maternal delivery of mRNA/miRNA/protein
in research on mosquito reproduction and embryonic development, and for the
development of a gene drive system based on maternal-effect dominant embryonic
arrest.
