Malaria causes millions of deaths worldwide and is considered a huge burden to
underdeveloped countries. The number of cases with resistance to all
antimalarials is continuously increasing, making the identification of novel
drugs a very urgent necessity. A potentially very interesting target for novel
therapeutic intervention is the parasite mitochondrion. In this work, we studied 
in Plasmodium falciparum 3 genes coding for proteins homologues of the mammalian 
FIS1 (Mitochondrial Fission Protein 1) and DRP1 (Dynamin Related Protein 1)
involved in mitochondrial fission. We studied the expression of P. falciparum
genes that show ample sequence and structural homologies with the mammalian
counterparts, namely FIS1, DYN1, and DYN2. The encoded proteins are characterized
by a distinct pattern of expression throughout the erythrocytic cycle of
P. falciparum, and their mRNAs are modulated by treating the parasite with the
host hormone melatonin. We have previously reported that the knockout of the
Plasmodium gene that codes for protein kinase 7 is essential for melatonin
sensing. We here show that PfPk7 knockout results in major alterations of
mitochondrial fission genes expression when compared to wild-type parasites, and 
no change in fission proteins expression upon treatment with the host hormone.
Finally, we have compared the morphological characteristics (using MitoTracker
Red CMX Ros) and oxygen consumption properties of P. falciparum mitochondria in
wild-type parasites and PfPk7 Knockout strains. A novel GFP construct targeted to
the mitochondrial matrix to wild-type parasites was also developed to visualize
P. falciparum mitochondria. We here show that, the functional characteristics of 
P. falciparum are profoundly altered in cells lacking protein kinase 7,
suggesting that this enzyme plays a major role in the control of mitochondrial
morphogenesis and maturation during the intra-erythrocyte cell cycle progression.
