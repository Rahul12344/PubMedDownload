Resistance to drugs that treat infectious disease is a major problem worldwide.
The rapid emergence of drug resistance is not well understood. We present two in 
silico models for the discovery of drug resistance mechanisms and for combating
the evolution of resistance, respectively. In the first model, we computationally
investigated subgraphs of a biological interaction network that show substantial 
adaptations when cells transcriptionally respond to a changing environment or
treatment. As a case study, we investigated the response of the malaria parasite 
Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine and tetracycline treatments. The second
model involves a machine learning technique that combines clustering, common
distance similarity measurements, and hierarchical clustering to propose new
combinations of drug targets.
