OBJECTIVE: To clone and express the DBL domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite
surface protein MSPDBL2(DBL2), and investigate its antigenicity.
METHODS: The DBL2 fragment was amplified by PCR and cloned into pET28a vector.
The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and
protein expression was induced by IPTG. The expressed product was purified by
Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
RESULTS: DBL2 gene fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein
MSPDBL2 (950 bp) was obtained by PCR. The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid was
identified by PCR, double enzyme digestion, and DNA sequencing. The recombinant
DBL2 protein was expressed in an inclusion body form with Mr 340,000 after being 
induced with IPTG. Moreover, the purified recombinant DBL2 protein was recognized
by sera from patients with falciparum malaria.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant pET28a-DBL2 plasmid has been constructed. The
purified rDBL2 protein shows adequate antigenicity.
