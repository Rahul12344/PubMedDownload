Background: Artemisinin-resistant malaria (ARM) remains a significant threat to
malaria elimination. In the Greater Mekong subregion, the prevalence of ARM in
certain regions has reached greater than 90%. Artemisinin-resistant malaria is
clinically identified by delayed parasite clearance and has been associated with 
mutations in the propeller domain of the kelch 13 gene. C580Y is the most
prevalent mutation. The detection of ARM currently relies on labor-intensive and 
time-consuming methods such as clinical phenotyping or in vitro susceptibility
testing.
Methods: We developed a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism loop mediated
isothermal amplification (SNP-LAMP) test method for the detection of the C580Y
mutation using a novel primer design strategy.
Results: The SNP-LAMP was 90.0% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI],
66.9-98.3) and 91.9% specific (95% CI, 82.6-96.7) without knowledge of the
parasite load and was 100% sensitive (95% CI, 79.9-100) and 97.3% specific (95%
CI, 89.7-99.5) when the parasitemia was within the assay dynamic range. Tests
with potential application near-to-patient such as SNP-LAMP may be deployed in
low- and middle-income and developed countries.
Conclusions: Single-nucleotide polymorphism LAMP can serve as a surveillance tool
and guide treatment algorithms for ARM in a clinically relevant time frame,
prevent unnecessary use of additional drugs that may drive additional resistance,
and avoid longer treatment regimens that cause toxicity for the patient.
