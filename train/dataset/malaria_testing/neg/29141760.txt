Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked erythrocyte
enzyme disorder with relevance to malaria treatment policy. Treatment with the
antimalarial primaquine can result in hemolytic anemia in G6PD-deficient
patients. With increased interest in primaquine use, it is important to identify 
G6PD variants in Ethiopia to inform malaria treatment policy. In the present
study, mutations in the G6PD gene are identified in a sample of patients with
malaria in Jimma town in southwest Ethiopia. Plasmodium species of infection were
confirmed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis. PCR and 
Sanger sequencing were performed to observe a portion of the G6PD gene where the 
common G6PD mutations (A376G, G202A, and C563T) are found. Molecular analysis
revealed that most of the samples were single Plasmodium vivax infections
(83.7%). For G6PD genotyping, A376G was detected in 23.26% of individuals,
whereas G202A and C563T were absent. Three other uncommon mutations were
identified: rs782669677 (535G→A), rs370658483, (485 + 37 G→T), and a new mutation
at chrX:154535443(C→T). Bioinformatic analysis of these mutations' potential
functional impact suggests minimal effect on protein function. The discovery of
both common and uncommon G6PD mutations contributes to the discussion on G6PD
deficiency and appropriate primaquine treatment in Ethiopia.
