Affinity maturation, the clonal selection and expansion of antigen-activated B
cells expressing somatically mutated antibody variants that develop during T
cell-dependent germinal center reactions, is considered pivotal for efficient
development of protective B cell memory responses to infection and vaccination.
Repeated antigen exposure promotes affinity maturation but each time also
recruits antigen-reactive naïve B cells into the response. Here, we determined
the relative impact of affinity maturation versus antigen-mediated clonal
selection of naïve B cells to mount potent B cell memory responses in humans
after repeated exposure to a complex pathogen, the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf). Using single-cell immunoglobulin (Ig) gene sequencing and
production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies, we analyzed the origin,
development, and quality of memory B cell responses to Pf circumsporozoite
protein (PfCSP), the major sporozoite surface protein. We show that after
repeated immunization of Pf-naïve volunteers with infectious Pf sporozoites
(PfSPZ Challenge) under chloroquine prophylaxis (PfSPZ-CVac), the clonal
selection of potent germline and memory B cell precursors against the central
PfCSP NANP repeat outpaces affinity maturation because the majority of Ig gene
mutations are affinity-neutral. Mathematical modeling explains how the efficiency
of affinity maturation decreases strongly with antigen complexity. Thus, in the
absence of long-term exposure, the frequency of antigen-reactive precursors and
likelihood of their activation rather than affinity maturation will determine the
quality of anti-PfCSP memory B cell responses. These findings have wide
implications for the design of vaccination strategies to induce potent B cell
memory responses against PfCSP and presumably other structurally complex
antigens.
