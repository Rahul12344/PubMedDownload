Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is among the most common single-gene diseases in the
world but evidence-based comprehensive health care has not been implemented where
the highest prevalence of SCD occurs, in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It represents 
an urgent health burden, both in terms of mortality and morbidity with an
estimated mortality of 8-16% in children under 5 years in SSA. Addressing the
high mortality of SCD in SSA and for effective management of SCD, newborn
screening (NBS) should be incorporated with prevention of infections (including
pneumococcal septicaemia and malaria), parental education and support at all
levels of healthcare provision to enable timely recognition. The NBS working
group of the Africa Sickle Cell Research Network (AfroSickleNet) collaboration
surveyed current projects in NBS in SSA, and current conditions that hinder more 
widespread implementation of NBS for SCD. Solutions based on new point-of-care
testing technology to disseminate education, and implementation science
approaches that leverage existing resources are proposed.
