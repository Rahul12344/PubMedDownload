Insecticides remain a main tool for the control of arthropod vectors. The urgency
to prevent the insurgence of insecticide resistance and the perspective to find
new target sites, for the development of novel molecules, are fuelling the study 
of the molecular mechanisms involved in insect defence against xenobiotic
compounds. In this study, we have investigated if ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, a major component of the defensome machinery, are involved in
defence against the insecticide permethrin, in susceptible larvae of the malaria 
vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto. Bioassays were performed with permethrin 
alone, or in combination with an ABC transporter inhibitor. Then we have
investigated the expression profiles of five ABC transporter genes at different
time points following permethrin exposure, to assess their expression patterns
across time. The inhibition of ABC transporters increased the larval mortality by
about 15-fold. Likewise, three genes were up-regulated after exposure to
permethrin, showing different patterns of expression across the 48 h. Our results
provide the first evidences of ABC transporters involvement in defence against a 
toxic in larvae of An. gambiae s.s. and show that the gene expression response is
modulated across time, being continuous, but stronger at the earliest and latest 
times after exposure.
