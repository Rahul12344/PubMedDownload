INTRODUCTION: Malaria is a human disease of which causes high morbidity and
mortality. In Plasmodium falciparum malaria, the resistance to antimalarial
drugs, especially chloroquine (CQ) is one of the paramount factors contributing
to the global increase in morbidity and mortality, due to malaria. Hence, there
is a need for detection of chloroquine drug resistance genes i.e., pfcrt-o
(Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter-o) and pfmdr-1
(Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance-1) of P. falciparum and pvcrt-o
(Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance transporter-o) and pvmdr-1 (Plasmodium
vivax multidrug resistance-1) of P. vivax by using molecular methods to prevent
mortality in malarial cases.
AIM: To standardize chloroquine drug sensitivity testing by molecular method so
as to provide reports of chloroquine within 6-8 hours to physicians for better
treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted over a period of one year from
January to December 2014. A Total of 300 blood samples were collected from
malaria suspected patient attending MGM Hospital, Kamothe, Navi Mumbai, India.
Out of 300 blood samples, 44 were malaria positive as assessed by Thick and Thin 
blood smear stained, by Leishman's method and examination with light microscope. 
Chloroquine drug sensitivity testing was performed using WHO III plate method
(micro test). Nested PCR was done for detection of pfcrt-o and pfmdr-1 for P.
falciparum and pvcrt-o, pvmdr-1 genes for P. vivax.
RESULTS: Total 44 samples were included in this study, out of which 22 samples
confirmed for Plasmodium falciparum and 22 samples confirmed for Plasmodium
vivax. Out of 22 P. falciparum 15 (68.18%) samples were chloroquine resistant. P.
vivax showed chloroquine resistance to 5 samples (22.73%) by method similar to
WHO III plate method (micro test) and nested PCR.
CONCLUSION: Drug resistance testing by molecular methods is useful for early
detection of antimalarial drug resistance. pfmdr-1 along with pfcrt-o can be used
as biomarker for chloroquine drug resistance in P. falciparum and pvmdr-1 along
with pvcrt-o for P. vivax.
