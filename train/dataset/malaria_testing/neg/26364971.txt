The apicomplexan order Haemosporida is a clade of unicellular blood parasites
that infect a variety of reptilian, avian and mammalian hosts. Among them are the
agents of human malaria, parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which pose a major
threat to human health. Illuminating the evolutionary history of Haemosporida may
help us in understanding their enormous biological diversity, as well as tracing 
the multiple host switches and associated acquisitions of novel life-history
traits. However, the deep-level phylogenetic relationships among major
haemosporidian clades have remained enigmatic because the datasets employed in
phylogenetic analyses were severely limited in either gene coverage or taxon
sampling. Using a PCR-based approach that employs a novel set of primers, we
sequenced fragments of 21 nuclear genes from seven haemosporidian parasites of
the genera Leucocytozoon, Haemoproteus, Parahaemoproteus, Polychromophilus and
Plasmodium. After addition of genomic data from 25 apicomplexan species, the
unreduced alignment comprised 20,580 bp from 32 species. Phylogenetic analyses
were performed based on nucleotide, codon and amino acid data employing Bayesian 
inference, maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony. All analyses resulted in
highly congruent topologies. We found consistent support for a basal position of 
Leucocytozoon within Haemosporida. In contrast to all previous studies, we
recovered a sister group relationship between the genera Polychromophilus and
Plasmodium. Within Plasmodium, the sauropsid and mammal-infecting lineages were
recovered as sister clades. Support for these relationships was high in nearly
all trees, revealing a novel phylogeny of Haemosporida, which is robust to the
choice of the outgroup and the method of tree inference.
