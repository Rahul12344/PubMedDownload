BACKGROUND: In Niger, malaria transmission is markedly seasonal with most of the 
disease burden occurring in children during the rainy season. Seasonal malaria
chemoprevention (SMC) with amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ + SP)
is recommended in the country to be administered monthly just before and during
the rainy season. Moreover, clinical decisions on use of SP for intermittent
preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) now depend upon the validated molecular 
markers for SP resistance in Plasmodium falciparum observed in the local parasite
population. However, little is known about molecular markers of resistance for
either SP or AQ in the south of Niger. To address this question, clinical samples
which met clinical and biological criteria, were collected in Gabi, Madarounfa
district, Maradi region, Niger in 2011-2012 (before SMC implementation).
Molecular markers of resistance to pyrimethamine (pfdhfr), sulfadoxine (pfdhps)
and amodiaquine (pfmdr1) were assessed by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Prior to SMC implementation, the samples showed a high proportion of
clinical samples that carried the pfdhfr 51I/59R/108N haplotype associated with
resistance to pyrimethamine and pfdhps 436A/F/H and 437G mutations associated
with reduced susceptibility to sulfadoxine. In contrast mutations in codons 581G,
and 613S in the pfdhps gene, and in pfmdr1, 86Y, 184Y, 1042D and 1246Y associated
with resistance to amodiaquine, were less frequently observed. Importantly,
pfdhfr I164L and pfdhps K540E mutations shown to be the most clinically relevant 
markers for high level clinical resistance to SP were not detected in Gabi.
CONCLUSIONS: Although parasites with genotypes associated with the highest levels
of resistance to AQ + SP are not yet common in this setting, their importance for
deployment of SMC and IPTp dictates that monitoring of these markers of
resistance should accompany these interventions. This study also highlights the
parasite heterogeneity within a small spatial area and the need to use caution
when extrapolating results from surveys of molecular markers of resistance in a
single site to inform regional policy decisions.
