To tackle the problem of insecticide resistance, all resistance mechanisms need
to be studied. This study investigated the involvement of the cuticle in
pyrethroid resistance in a strain of Anopheles gambiae, MRS, free of kdr
mutations. Bioassays revealed MRS to be resistant to pyrethroids and DDT,
indicated by increasing knockdown times and resistance ratios. Moreover,
biochemical analysis indicated that metabolic resistance based on enhanced CYP450
activity may also play a role. Insecticide penetration assays showed that there
were significantly lower amounts of insecticide in the MRS strain than in the
susceptible control. Analysis of the levels of the selected transcripts by qPCR
showed that CYP6M2, a major pyrethroid metaboliser, CYP4G16, a gene implicated in
resistance via its contribution to the biosynthesis of elevated epicuticular
hydrocarbons that delay insecticide uptake, and the cuticle genes CPAP3-E and
CPLCX1 were upregulated after insecticide exposure. Other metabolic (CYP6P3,
GSTe2) and cuticle (CPLCG3, CPRs) genes were also constitutively upregulated.
Microscopic analysis showed that the cuticle layers of the MRS strain were
significantly thicker than those of the susceptible strain. This study allowed us
to assess the contribution made by the cuticle and metabolic mechanisms to
pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles gambiae without target-site mutations.
