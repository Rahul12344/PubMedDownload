Cerebral malaria (CM) is associated with low nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability,
cerebrovascular constriction, occlusion, and hypoperfusion. Administration of
exogenous NO partially prevents the neurological syndrome and associated vascular
pathology in an experimental CM (ECM) mouse model. In this study, we evaluated
the effects of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate in preventing ECM and, in
combination with artemether, rescuing late-stage ECM mice from mortality. The
glyceryl trinitrate and/or artemether effect on survival and clinical recovery
was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA. NO synthase (NOS)
expression in mouse brain was determined by Western blots. Mean arterial pressure
(MAP) and pial arteriolar diameter were monitored using a tail-cuff blood
pressure system and a cranial window preparation, respectively. Preventative
administration of glyceryl trinitrate at 0.025 mg/h decreased ECM mortality from 
67 to 11% and downregulated inducible NOS expression in the brain. When
administered as adjunctive rescue therapy with artemether, glyceryl trinitrate
increased survival from 47 to 79%. The adjunctive therapy caused a sustained
reversal of pial arteriolar vasoconstriction in ECM mice, an effect not observed 
with artemether alone. Glyceryl trinitrate induced a 13% decrease in MAP in
uninfected mice but did not further affect MAP in hypotensive ECM mice. Glyceryl 
trinitrate, when combined with artemether, was an effective adjunctive rescue
treatment for ECM. This treatment ameliorated pial arteriolar vasospasm and did
not significantly affect MAP. These results indicate that transdermal glyceryl
trinitrate has potential to be considered as a candidate for adjunctive therapy
for CM.
