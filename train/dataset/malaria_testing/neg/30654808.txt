BACKGROUND: Reduced artemisinin susceptibility and artemisinin-based combination 
therapy (ACT)-resistance against Plasmodium falciparum and
chloroquine (CQ)-resistant P. vivax malaria has been reported in Vietnam. Two
therapeutic efficacy studies were conducted in Thuan Bac District (Ninh Thuan
Province, Vietnam) in 2015 and 2016 to determine the extent of reduced
artemisinin susceptibility and ACT resistant falciparum malaria, and CQ-resistant
vivax malaria were present.
METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with falciparum malaria were randomized to receive
artesunate alone (AS ~ 4 mg/kg/day) for 4 days followed by dihydroartemisinin
(DHA) (2.2 mg/kg)-piperaquine (PPQ) (18 mg/kg) daily for 3 days or artemether
(AM) (1.7 mg/kg)-lumefantrine (LUM) (12 mg/kg) twice daily for 3 days. Sixteen
subjects with vivax malaria received CQ (total 25 mg/kg over 3 days). The
therapeutic efficacy study for treating falciparum malaria was complemented with 
molecular analysis for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance, and in vitro drug 
susceptibility testing. Patient's drug exposure following both falciparum and
vivax treatment studies was determined.
RESULTS: Twenty-five of 27 patients treated with the artemisinin regimens
completed the 42-day follow-up period. None had parasites present on day 3 after 
commencing treatment with no incidence of recrudescence (100% curative rate). One
patient on AS + DHA-PPQ was lost to follow-up and one patient had Plasmodium
falciparum and Plasmodium vivax infection on day 0 by PCR. Of the vivax patients,
15 of 16 completed CQ treatment and two had a recurrence of vivax malaria on day 
28, a failure rate of 13.3% (2/15). No mutations in the Pfkelch-13 gene for
artemisinin resistance or exo-E415G gene polymorphism and amplification in
plasmepsins 2 and 3 for piperaquine resistance were observed. In vitro testing of
patient's falciparum parasites indicated susceptibility (low IC50 nM values) to
dihydroartemisinin, lumefantrine, piperaquine and pyronaridine. Patient's drug
exposure to artesunate and lumefantrine was comparable to published data,
however, blood CQ concentrations were lower.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical findings, molecular analysis and in vitro testing revealed 
that the falciparum parasites at Phuoc Chien Commune were artemisinin
susceptible. The clinical failure rate of the 15 vivax patients who completed CQ 
treatment was 13%. Further studies are required to determine whether CQ-resistant
vivax malaria is present at the commune.
