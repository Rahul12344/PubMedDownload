Malaria continues to be a devastating disease, largely caused by Plasmodium
falciparum infection. We investigated the effects of opioid and cannabinoid
receptor antagonists on the growth of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum. The delta 
opioid receptor antagonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX) and the cannabinoid
receptor antagonists rimonaband and SR144528 caused growth arrest of the
parasite. Notably BNTX and the established antimalarial drug dihydroartemisinin
induced prominent pyknosis in parasite cells after a short period of incubation. 
We compared genome-wide transcriptome profiles in P. falciparum with different
degrees of pyknosis in response to drug treatment, and identified 11 transcripts 
potentially associated with the evoking of pyknosis, of which three, including
glutathione reductase (PfGR), triose phosphate transporter (PfoTPT), and a
conserved Plasmodium membrane protein, showed markedly different gene expression 
levels in accordance with the degree of pyknosis. Furthermore, the use of
specific inhibitors confirmed PfGR but not PfoTPT as a possible factor
contributing to the development of pyknosis. A reduction in total glutathione
levels was also detected in association with increased pyknosis. These results
further our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for P. falciparum
development and the antimalarial activity of dihydroartemisinin, and provide
useful information for the development of novel antimalarial agents.
