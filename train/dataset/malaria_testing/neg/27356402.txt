OBJECTIVE: To clone a gametocyte specific protein Pfgdv1 of Plasmodium
falciparum, express and identify recombinant Pfgdvl protein in vitro.
METHODS: PCR was performed to amplify Pfgdv1 from P. falciparum DNA which was got
from the patient who was infected with P. falciparum, and the PCR product was
inserted into pET28a (+) vector. pET28a-Pfgdv1 recombinant plasmid was
constructed and transformed into E. coli host BL21 (DE3+). IPTG was used to
induce the recombinant Pfgdv1 protein fused with His tag, and the protein was
purified by His-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was
identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
RESULTS: The PCR product of Pfgdv1 gene was about 1.65 kb, meeting the
expectation of predicted fragment size. The recombinant protein was about 67 kDa,
which could be recognized by His-Tag monoclonal antibody.
CONCLUSION: The Pfgdv1 gene of P. falciparum is successfully cloned, and the
recombinant Pfgdv1 protein is expressed, thereby providing an opportunity for
further study on transmission blocking vaccine.
