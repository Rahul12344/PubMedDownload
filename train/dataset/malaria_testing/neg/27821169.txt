BACKGROUND: Examining essential biochemical pathways in Plasmodium falciparum
presents serious challenges, as standard molecular techniques such as siRNA
cannot be employed in this organism, and generating gene knock-outs of essential 
proteins requires specialized conditional approaches. In the study of protein
kinases, pharmacological inhibition presents a feasible alternative option.
However, as in mammalian systems, inhibitors often lack the desired selectivity. 
Described here is a chemical genetic approach to selectively inhibit Pfnek-2 in
P. falciparum, a member of the NIMA-related kinase family that is essential for
completion of the sexual development of the parasite.
RESULTS: Introduction of a valine to cysteine mutation at position 24 in the
glycine rich loop of Pfnek-2 does not affect kinase activity but confers
sensitivity to the protein kinase inhibitor 4-(6-ethynyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)
benzene sulfonamide (NCL-00016066). Using a combination of in vitro kinase assays
and mass spectrometry, (including phosphoproteomics) the study shows that this
compound acts as an irreversible inhibitor to the mutant Pfnek2 likely through a 
covalent link with the introduced cysteine residue. In particular, this was shown
by analysis of total protein mass using mass spectrometry which showed a shift in
molecular weight of the mutant kinase in the presence of the inhibitor to be
precisely equivalent to the molecular weight of NCL-00016066. A similar molecular
weight shift was not observed in the wild type kinase. Importantly, this
inhibitor has little activity towards the wild type Pfnek-2 and, therefore, has
all the properties of an effective chemical genetic tool that could be employed
to determine the cellular targets for Pfnek-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Allelic replacement of wild-type Pfnek-2 with the mutated kinase
will allow for targeted inhibition of Pfnek-2 with NCL-00016066 and hence pave
the way for comparative studies aimed at understanding the biological role and
transmission-blocking potential of Pfnek-2.
