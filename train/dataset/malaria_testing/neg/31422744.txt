Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by pathogenic species of Leptospira.
Leptospires are able to adhere to exposed extracellular matrix in injured tissues
and, once in the bloodstream, can survive the attack of the immune system and
spread to colonize target organs. In this work, we report that two novel putative
proteins, coded by the genes LIC11711 and LIC12587 of L. interrogans serovar
Copenhageni are conserved among pathogenic strains, and probably exposed in the
bacterial surface. Soluble recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia
coli, purified and characterized. Both recombinant proteins bound to laminin and 
E-cadherin, suggesting an initial adhesion function in host epithelial cells. The
recombinant protein LIC11711 (rLIC11711) was able to capture plasminogen (PLG)
from normal human serum and convert to enzymatically active plasmin (PLA), in the
presence of PLG activator. rLIC12587 (recombinant protein LIC12587) displayed a
dose dependent and saturable interaction with components C7, C8, and C9 of the
complement system, reducing the bactericidal effect of the complement. Binding to
C9 may have consequences such as C9 polymerization inhibition, interfering with
the membrane attack complex formation. Blocking LIC11711 and LIC12587 on
bacterial cells by the respective antiserum reduced leptospiral cell viability
when exposed to normal human serum (NHS). Both recombinant proteins could be
recognized by serum samples of confirmed leptospirosis, but not of unrelated
diseases, suggesting that the native proteins are immunogenic and expressed
during leptospirosis. Taken together, our data suggest that these proteins may
have a role in leptospiral pathogenesis, participating in immune evasion
strategies.
