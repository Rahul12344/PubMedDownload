The lack of endogenous RNAi machinery in the malaria parasite Plasmodium hampers 
gene annotation and hence antimalarial drug and vaccine development. Here, we
engineered rodent Plasmodium berghei to express a minimal, non-canonical RNAi
machinery that solely requires Argonaute 2 (Ago2) and a modified short hairpin
RNA, so-called AgoshRNA. Using this strategy, we achieved robust and specific
gene knockdown throughout the entire parasite life cycle. We also successfully
silenced the endogenous gene perforin-like protein 2, phenocopying a full gene
knockout. Transcriptionally restricting Ago2 expression to the liver stage
further enabled us to perform a stage-specific gene knockout. The RNAi-competent 
Plasmodium lines reported here will be a valuable resource for loss-of-function
phenotyping of the many uncharacterized genes of Plasmodium in low or high
throughput, without the need to engineer the target gene locus. Thereby, our new 
strategy and transgenic Plasmodium lines will ultimately benefit the discovery of
urgently needed antimalarial drug and vaccine candidates. Generally, the ability 
to render RNAi-negative organisms RNAi-competent by mere introduction of two
components, Ago2 and AgoshRNA, is a unique paradigm that should find broad
applicability in other species.
