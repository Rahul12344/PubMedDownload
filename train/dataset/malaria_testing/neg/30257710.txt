BACKGROUND: The merozoite of the zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi invades human
erythrocytes via the binding of its Duffy binding protein (PkDBPαII) to the Duffy
antigen on the eythrocytes. The Duffy antigen has two immunologically distinct
forms, Fya and Fyb. In this study, the erythrocyte-binding assay was used to
quantitatively determine and compare the binding level of PkDBPαII to Fya+/b+ and
Fya+/b- human erythrocytes.
RESULTS: In the erythrocyte-binding assay, binding level was determined by
scoring the number of rosettes that were formed by erythrocytes surrounding
transfected mammalian COS-7 cells which expressed PkDBPαII. The assay result
revealed a significant difference in the binding level. The number of rosettes
scored for Fya+/b+ was 1.64-fold higher than that of Fya+/b- (155.50 ± 34.32 and 
94.75 ± 23.16 rosettes, respectively; t(6) = -2.935, P = 0.026).
CONCLUSIONS: The erythrocyte-binding assay provided a simple approach to
quantitatively determine the binding level of PkDBPαII to the erythrocyte Duffy
antigen. Using this assay, PkDBPαII was found to display higher binding to
Fya+/b+ erythrocytes than to Fya+/b- erythrocytes.
