Sickle cell disease encompasses a wide range of genotypic presentation with
particular clinical features. The entity affects millions of people, particularly
those whose ancestors came from sub-Saharan Africa and other countries in the
Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia, and India. Currently, the high frequency of S
and C genes reflects natural selection through the protection of heterozygotes
against severe malaria, the high frequency of consanguineous marriages,
improvement of some public health policies and the nutritional standards in the
poorer countries where newborns are now living long enough to present for
diagnosis and management. Although there is a high burden of the disease, in many
countries, the new-born sickle cell screening test is being performed and is
rendering an early diagnosis; however, it is still difficult for sickle cell
patients to find proper treatment and adequate follow-up. Moreover, in many
countries, patients are neither aware of their diagnosis nor the care they should
receive to prevent complications; also, they do not receive adequate genetic
counseling. Hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease is the most frequent double sickle cell 
heterozygosis found in Brazil. The clinical course tends to be more benign with
fewer hospitalizations compared with double homozygotic SS patients. However,
HbSC patients may present severe complications with a fatal outcome. We report
the case of a 36-year-old man who presented to the emergency care facility with
symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of sickling crisis. The outcome was
unfavorable and death occurred just hours after admission. The autopsy revealed a
generalized vaso-occlusive crisis by sickled red cells, bone marrow necrosis, and
fat embolism syndrome.
