Malaria causes worldwide morbidity and mortality, and while chemotherapy remains 
an excellent means of malaria control, drug-resistant parasites necessitate the
discovery of new antimalarials. Peptidases are a promising class of drug targets 
and perform several important roles during the Plasmodium falciparum erythrocytic
life cycle. Herein, we report a multidisciplinary effort combining activity-based
protein profiling, biochemical, and peptidomic approaches to functionally analyze
two genetically essential P. falciparum metallo-aminopeptidases (MAPs), PfA-M1
and Pf-LAP. Through the synthesis of a suite of activity-based probes (ABPs)
based on the general MAP inhibitor scaffold, bestatin, we generated specific ABPs
for these two enzymes. Specific inhibition of PfA-M1 caused swelling of the
parasite digestive vacuole and prevented proteolysis of hemoglobin (Hb)-derived
oligopeptides, likely starving the parasite resulting in death. In contrast,
inhibition of Pf-LAP was lethal to parasites early in the life cycle, prior to
the onset of Hb degradation suggesting that Pf-LAP has an essential role outside 
of Hb digestion.
