Plasmodium falciparum causes a spectrum of malarial disease from asymptomatic to 
uncomplicated through to severe. Investigations of parasite virulence have
associated the expression of distinct variants of the major surface antigen of
the blood stages known as Pf EMP1 encoded by up to 60 var genes per genome.
Looking at the population genomics of var genes in cases of uncomplicated
malaria, we set out to determine if there was any evidence of a selective sweep
of specific var genes or clonal epidemic structure related to the incidence of
uncomplicated disease in children. By sequencing the conserved DBLα domain of var
genes from six sentinel sites in Uganda we found that the parasites causing
uncomplicated P. falciparum disease in children were highly diverse and that
every child had a unique var DBLα repertoire. Despite extensive var DBLα
diversity and minimal overlap between repertoires, specific DBLα types and groups
were conserved at the population level across Uganda. This pattern was the same
regardless of the geographic distance or malaria transmission intensity. These
data lead us to propose that any parasite can cause uncomplicated malarial
disease and that these diverse parasite repertoires are composed of both upsA and
non-upsA var gene groups.
