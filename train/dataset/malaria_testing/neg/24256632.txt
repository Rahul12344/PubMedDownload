OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if systemic murine malarial infection enhances HIV
susceptibility through parasite-induced mucosal immune alterations at sites of
HIV sexual exposure.
BACKGROUND: Malaria and HIV have a high degree of geographical overlap and
interact substantially within coinfected individuals. We used a murine model to
test the hypothesis that malaria might also enhance HIV susceptibility at mucosal
sites of HIV sexual exposure.
METHODS: Female C57/BL6 mice were infected with Plasmodium chabaudi malaria using
a standardized protocol. Blood, gastrointestinal tissues, upper and lower genital
tract tissues, and iliac lymph nodes were sampled 10 days postinfection, and the 
expression of putative HIV susceptibility and immune activation markers on T
cells was assessed by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: P. chabaudi malaria increased expression of mucosal homing integrin α4β7
on blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, and these α4β7 T cells had significantly increased 
co-expression of both CCR5 and CD38. In addition, malaria increased expression of
the HIV co-receptor CCR5 on CD4 T cells from the genital tract and gut mucosa as 
well as mucosal T-cell expression of the immune activation markers CD38, Major
Histocompatibility Complex -II (MHC-II) and CD69.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic murine malarial infection induced substantial upregulation 
of the mucosal homing integrin α4β7 in blood as well as gut and genital mucosal
T-cell immune activation and HIV co-receptor expression. Human studies are
required to confirm these murine findings and to examine whether malarial
infection enhances the sexual acquisition of HIV.
