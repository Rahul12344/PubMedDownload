Mosquitoes possess an innate immune system that is capable of limiting infection 
by a variety of pathogens, including the Plasmodium spp. parasites responsible
for human malaria. The Anopheles immune deficiency (IMD) innate immune signaling 
pathway confers resistance to Plasmodium falciparum. While some previously
identified Anopheles anti-Plasmodium effectors are regulated through signaling by
Rel2, the transcription factor of the IMD pathway, many components of this
defense system remain uncharacterized. To begin to better understand the
regulation of immune effector proteins by the IMD pathway, we used
oligonucleotide microarrays and iTRAQ to analyze differences in mRNA and protein 
expression, respectively, between transgenic Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes
exhibiting blood meal-inducible overexpression of an active recombinant Rel2 and 
their wild-type conspecifics. Numerous genes were differentially regulated at
both the mRNA and protein levels following induction of Rel2. While multiple
immune genes were up-regulated, a majority of the differentially expressed genes 
have no known immune function in mosquitoes. Selected up-regulated genes from
multiple functional categories were tested for both anti-Plasmodium and
anti-bacterial action using RNA interference (RNAi). Based on our experimental
findings, we conclude that increased expression of the IMD immune
pathway-controlled transcription factor Rel2 affects the expression of numerous
genes with diverse functions, suggesting a broader physiological impact of immune
activation and possible functional versatility of Rel2. Our study has also
identified multiple novel genes implicated in anti-Plasmodium defense.
