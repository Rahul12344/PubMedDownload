BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is threatening the
success of malaria control programmes. In order to implement suitable insecticide
resistance management strategies, it is necessary to understand the underlying
mechanisms involved. To achieve this, the molecular basis of permethrin and DDT
resistance in the principal malaria vector, Anopheles funestus from inland Benin 
(Kpome), was investigated.
RESULTS: Here, using a microarray-based genome-wide transcription and qRT-PCR
analysis, we showed that metabolic resistance mechanisms through over-expression 
of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase genes (GSTs) are a major
contributor to DDT and permethrin resistance in Anopheles funestus from Kpome.
The GSTe2 gene was the most upregulated detoxification gene in both DDT-
[fold-change (FC: 16.0)] and permethrin-resistant (FC: 18.1) mosquitoes
suggesting that upregulation of this gene could contribute to DDT resistance and 
cross-resistance to permethrin. CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b genes that have been
previously associated with pyrethroid resistance were also significantly
overexpressed with FC 5.4 and 4.8, respectively, in a permethrin resistant
population. Noticeably, the GSTs, GSTd1-5 and GSTd3, were more upregulated in
DDT-resistant than in permethrin-resistant Anopheles funestus suggesting these
genes are more implicated in DDT resistance. The absence of the L1014F or L1014S 
kdr mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene coupled with the lack of
directional selection at the gene further supported that knockdown resistance
plays little role in this resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The major role played by metabolic resistance to pyrethroids in this
An. funestus population in Benin suggests that using novel control tools
combining the P450 synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), such as PBO-based bednets,
could help manage the growing pyrethroid resistance in this malaria vector in
Benin.
