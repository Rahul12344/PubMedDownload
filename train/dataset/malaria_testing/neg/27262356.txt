The archipelago of São Tomé and Principe (STP), West Africa, has suffered the
heavy burden of malaria since the 16th century. Until the last decade, when after
a successful control program STP has become a low transmission country and one of
the few nations with decreases of more than 90% in malaria admission and death
rates. We carried out a longitudinal study to determine the genetic structure of 
STP parasite populations over time and space. Twelve microsatellite loci were
genotyped in Plasmodium falciparum samples from two islands collected in 1997,
2000 and 2004. Analysis was performed on proportions of mixed genotype
infections, allelic diversity, population differentiation, effective population
size and bottleneck effects. We have found high levels of genetic diversity and
minimal inter-population genetic differentiation typical of African continental
regions with intense and stable malaria transmission. We detected significant
differences between the years, with special emphasis for 1997 that showed the
highest proportion of samples infected with P. falciparum and the highest mean
number of haplotypes per isolate. This study establishes a comprehensive genetic 
data baseline of a pre-intervention scenario for future studies; taking into
account the most recent and successful control intervention on the territory.
