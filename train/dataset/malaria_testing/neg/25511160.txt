BACKGROUND: In Brazil, the autochthonous transmission of extra-Amazonian malaria 
occurs mainly in areas of the southeastern coastal Atlantic Forest, where
Anopheles cruzii is the primary vector. In these locations, the population
density of the mosquito varies with altitude (5-263 m above sea level), prompting
us to hypothesise that gene flow is also unevenly distributed. Describing the
micro-geographical and temporal biological variability of this species may be a
key to understanding the dispersion of malaria in the region. We explored the
homogeneity of the An. cruzii population across its altitudinal range of
distribution using wing shape and mtDNA gene analysis. We also assessed the
stability of wing geometry over time.
METHODS: Larvae were sampled from lowland (5-20 m) and hilltop (81-263 m) areas
in a primary Atlantic Forest region, in the municipality of Cananéia (State of
São Paulo, Brazil). The right wings of males and females were analysed by
standard geometric morphometrics. Eighteen landmarks were digitised for each
individual and a discriminant analysis was used to compare samples from the
hilltop and lowland. A 400-bp DNA fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase gene subunit I (CO-I) was PCR-amplified and sequenced.
RESULTS: Wing shapes were distinct between lowland and hilltop population
samples. Results of cross-validated tests based on Mahalanobis distances showed
that the individuals from both micro-environments were correctly reclassified in 
a range of 54-96%. The wings of hilltop individuals were larger. The CO-I gene
was highly polymorphic (haplotypic diversity = 0.98) and altitudinally structured
(Фst = 0.085 and Jaccard = 0.033). We found 60 different haplotypes but only two 
were shared by the lowland and hilltop populations. Wing shape changed over the
brief study period (2009-2013).
CONCLUSIONS: Wing geometry and CO-I gene analysis indicated that An. cruzii is
vertically structured. Wing shape varied rapidly, but altitude structure was
maintained. Future investigations should identify the biotic/abiotic causes of
these patterns and their implications in the local epidemiology of malaria.
