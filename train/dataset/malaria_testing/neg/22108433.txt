In order to maximise compliance, the future antimalarial treatment should ideally
require just a single-dose administration. This, in turn, demands new fast-acting
effective drugs. Currently, methods to measure the in vitro killing rate of
antimalarials are based on parasite growth. We have developed and validated a
method to determine and classify antimalarial agents based on their cidal or
static activity following quantitative Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis. The
method described here is a fast, reliable and user-friendly technique with a
medium throughput. Metabolic activity of the parasite is followed by measuring
mRNA expression levels of several genes during 5 parasite life cycles. mRNA from 
the parasite culture is then retrotranscribed to cDNA and quantified by RT-PCR.
This new method provides a rapid and reproducible way to accurately measure the
antimalarial activity of new compounds in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum.
