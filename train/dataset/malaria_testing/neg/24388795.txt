Entomological monitoring of Leishmania infection in leishmaniasis endemic areas
offers epidemiologic advantages for predicting the risk and expansion of the
disease, as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of control programs. In this 
study, we developed a highly sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP) method for the mass screening of sand flies for Leishmania infection based
on the 18S rRNA gene. The LAMP technique could detect 0.01 parasites, which was
more sensitive than classical PCR. The method was robust and could amplify the
target DNA within 1h from a crude sand fly template without DNA purification.
Amplicon detection could be accomplished by the newly developed colorimetric
malachite green (MG)--mediated naked eye visualization. Pre-addition of MG to the
LAMP reaction solution did not inhibit amplification efficiency. The field
applicability of the colorimetric MG-based LAMP assay was demonstrated with 397
field-caught samples from the endemic areas of Ecuador and eight positive sand
flies were detected. The robustness, superior sensitivity, and ability to produce
better visual discriminatory reaction products than existing LAMP fluorescence
and turbidity assays indicated the field potential usefulness of this new method 
for surveillance and epidemiological studies of leishmaniasis in developing
countries.
