OBJECTIVES: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax occur in Mauritania.
Drug-resistant P. falciparum has been reported, but the drug-resistance status of
P. vivax is unknown. The aims of the present study were to determine the
prevalence of mutant pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvmdr1 genes and of pvmdr1 gene
amplification in P. vivax isolates in Nouakchott, the capital city of Mauritania,
and to establish a baseline for molecular surveillance of drug-resistant P. vivax
in the country.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, 439 febrile patients were screened
for malaria in Nouakchott. The sequences of pvdhfr, pvdhps and pvmdr1 markers in 
110 P. vivax isolates were determined by direct sequencing of PCR products. The
pvmdr1 gene copy number was determined by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: The majority of the isolates with a successful PCR amplification (76/86,
88%) were characterized to be of the wild-type pvdhfr genotype, while the
remaining 10 isolates carried the S58R and S117N double mutations. All isolates
had the wild-type pvdhps genotype SAKAV. For pvmdr1, 75 of 103 (73%) had the
wild-type Y976, and 28 (27%) carried the mutant F976. Most (98%) carried the
mutant L1076 codon. Of 105 isolates, 102 (97%) had one copy and 3 (3%) had two
copies of the pvmdr1 gene.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of mutations associated with antifolate resistance is
low in Mauritania. Further studies are required to determine the roles of pvmdr1 
mutations and gene amplification in conferring drug resistance. These data will
serve as a baseline for further monitoring of drug-resistant malaria.
