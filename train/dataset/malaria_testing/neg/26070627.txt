BACKGROUND: The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a complex and
multi-stage life cycle that requires extensive and precise gene regulation to
allow invasion and hijacking of host cells, transmission, and immune escape. To
date, the regulatory elements orchestrating these critical parasite processes
remain largely unknown. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could represent a missing regulatory layer across a
broad range of organisms.
RESULTS: To investigate the regulatory capacity of lncRNA in P. falciparum, we
harvested fifteen samples from two time-courses. Our sample set profiled 56 h of 
P. falciparum blood stage development. We then developed and validated
strand-specific, non-polyA-selected RNA sequencing methods, and pursued the first
assembly of P. falciparum strand-specific transcript structures from RNA
sequencing data. This approach enabled the annotation of over one thousand lncRNA
transcript models and their comprehensive global analysis: coding prediction,
periodicity, stage-specificity, correlation, GC content, length, location
relative to annotated transcripts, and splicing. We validated the complete
splicing structure of three lncRNAs with compelling properties.
Non-polyA-selected deep sequencing also enabled the prediction of hundreds of
intriguing P. falciparum circular RNAs, six of which we validated experimentally.
CONCLUSIONS: We found that a subset of lncRNAs, including all subtelomeric
lncRNAs, strongly peaked in expression during invasion. By contrast, antisense
transcript levels significantly dropped during invasion. As compared to
neighboring mRNAs, the expression of antisense-sense pairs was significantly
anti-correlated during blood stage development, indicating transcriptional
interference. We also validated that P. falciparum produces circRNAs, which is
notable given the lack of RNA interference in the organism, and discovered that a
highly expressed, five-exon antisense RNA is poised to regulate P. falciparum
gametocyte development 1 (PfGDV1), a gene required for early sexual commitment
events.
