Insecticide resistance is typically associated with alterations to the
insecticidal target-site or with gene expression variation at loci involved in
insecticide detoxification. In some species copy number variation (CNV) of target
site loci (e.g. the Ace-1 target site of carbamate insecticides) or
detoxification genes has been implicated in the resistance phenotype. We show
that field-collected Ugandan Culex quinquefasciatus display CNV for the
voltage-gated sodium channel gene (Vgsc), target-site of pyrethroid and
organochlorine insecticides. In order to develop field-applicable diagnostics for
Vgsc CN, and as a prelude to investigating the possible association of CN with
insecticide resistance, three assays were compared for their accuracy in CN
estimation in this species. The gold standard method is droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR), however, the hardware is prohibitively expensive for widespread utility.
Here, ddPCR was compared to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and pyrosequencing. Across
all platforms, CNV was detected in ≈10% of mosquitoes, corresponding to three or 
four copies (per diploid genome). ddPCR and qPCR-Std-curve yielded similar
predictions for Vgsc CN, indicating that the qPCR protocol developed here can be 
applied as a diagnostic assay, facilitating monitoring of Vgsc CN in wild
populations and the elucidation of association between the Vgsc CN and
insecticide resistance.
