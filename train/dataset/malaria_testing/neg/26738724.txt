Plasmodium ovale is rare and not exactly known to be autochthonous in Malaysia.
There are two distinct forms of the parasite, namely P. ovale curtisi (classic
form) and P. ovale wallikeri (variant form). Here, the first sequence confirmed
case of an imported P. ovale wallikeri infection in Malaysia is presented.
Microscopy found Plasmodium parasites with morphology similar to P. ovale or
Plasmodium vivax in the blood films. Further confirmation using polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) targeting the small-subunit rRNA gene of the parasite was
unsuccessful. Genus-specific PCR was then performed and the product was sequenced
and analysed. Sequence analyses confirmed the aetiological agent as P. ovale
wallikeri. New species-specific primers (rOVA1v and rOVA2v) were employed and P. 
ovale wallikeri was finally confirmed. The findings highlight the need to look
out for imported malaria infections in Malaysia and the importance of a
constantly updated and validated diagnostic technique.
