The bc1 complex is central to mitochondrial bioenergetics and the target of the
antimalarial drug atovaquone that binds in the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of the 
complex. Structural analysis has shown that the Qo site residue Y279 (Y268 in
Plasmodium falciparum) is key for atovaquone binding. Consequently, atovaquone
resistance can be acquired by mutation of that residue. In addition to the
probability of amino acid substitution, the level of atovaquone resistance and
the loss of bc1 complex activity that are associated with the novel amino acid
would restrict the nature of resistance-driven mutations occurring on atovaquone 
exposure in native parasite populations. Using the yeast model, we characterized 
the effect of all the amino acid replacements resulting from a single nucleotide 
substitution at codon 279: Y279C, Y279D, Y279F, Y279H, Y279N, and Y279S (Y279C,
D, F, H, N, and S). Two residue changes that required a double nucleotide
substitution, Y279A and W, were added to the series. We found that mutations
Y279A, C, and S conferred high atovaquone resistance but decreased the catalytic 
activity. Y279F had wild-type enzymatic activity and sensitivity to atovaquone,
while the other substitutions caused a dramatic respiratory defect. The results
obtained with the yeast model were examined in regard to atomic structure and
compared to the reported data on the evolution of acquired atovaquone resistance 
in P. falciparum.
