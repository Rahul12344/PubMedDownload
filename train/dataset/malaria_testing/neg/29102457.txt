Malaria infection poses a great threaten to public health even nowadays. The
conventional diagnosis tools of malaria parasites and vectors require systematic 
training for the observers accompanied by the low throughput. In this study, a
new detection system, i.e., multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (mμLAMP) array, was developed to provide a convenient, rapid and
economical detection system for malaria diagnosis. A microfluidic-based detection
chip was designed and developed, targeting the conserved gene of four Anopheles
and two Plasmodium species responsible for most of the malaria cases occurred in 
China. The DNA preparation of Anopheles and Plasmodium samples was realized by
using a newly-developed DNA extraction method. For this mμLAMP array system, the 
detection limit was determined to be 1pg of targeting DNA with high sensitivity
(>95%) and specificity (100%). Further, the accuracy of such mμLAMP analysis was 
evaluated by the analysis of 48 Anopheles mosquito samples, of which 30 were
termed to be target Anopheles, displaying high consistency with that by
morphological analysis. In conclusion, the mμLAMP detection system was proved to 
be a visible, sensitive, specific and high-throughput diagnostic tool.
Considering the portable manipulation of such detection system, our studies shed 
light on its potential application of malaria surveillance on the spot.
