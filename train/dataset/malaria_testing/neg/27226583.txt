Diversity at pathogen genetic loci can be driven by host adaptive immune
selection pressure and may reveal proteins important for parasite biology.
Population-based genome sequencing of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite
responsible for the most severe form of malaria, has highlighted two related
polymorphic genes called dblmsp and dblmsp2, which encode Duffy binding-like
(DBL) domain-containing proteins located on the merozoite surface but whose
function remains unknown. Using recombinant proteins and transgenic parasites, we
show that DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 directly and avidly bind human IgM via their DBL
domains. We used whole genome sequence data from over 400 African and Asian P.
falciparum isolates to show that dblmsp and dblmsp2 exhibit extreme protein
polymorphism in their DBL domain, with multiple variants of two major allelic
classes present in every population tested. Despite this variability, the IgM
binding function was retained across diverse sequence representatives. Although
this interaction did not seem to have an effect on the ability of the parasite to
invade red blood cells, binding of DBLMSP and DBLMSP2 to IgM inhibited the
overall immunoreactivity of these proteins to IgG from patients who had been
exposed to the parasite. This suggests that IgM binding might mask these proteins
from the host humoral immune system.
