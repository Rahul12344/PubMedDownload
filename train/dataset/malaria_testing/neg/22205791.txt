Using a newly developed Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 1 gene
(Pvmsp1) heteroduplex tracking assay, we genotyped 107 P. vivax infections in
individuals from Cambodia, 45 of whom developed recurrent parasitemia within 42
days. The majority of isolates were polyclonal, but recurrent parasitemias
displayed fewer variants compared to initial parasitemias. Two Pvmsp1 gene
variants occurred more frequently in the initial genotypes of those who developed
recurrent parasitemia, representing the first time P. vivax variants associated
with a higher risk of relapse have been described.
