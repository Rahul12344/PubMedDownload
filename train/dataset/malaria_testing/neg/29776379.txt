BACKGROUND: The spread of insecticide resistance (IR) is a major threat to vector
control programmes for mosquito-borne diseases. Early detection of IR using
diagnostic markers could help inform these programmes, especially in remote
locations where gathering reliable bioassay data is challenging. Most current
molecular tests for genetic IR markers are only suitable for use in well-equipped
laboratory settings. There is an unmet need for field-applicable diagnostics.
METHODS: A single-cartridge test was designed to detect key IR mutations in the
major African vector of malaria, Anopheles gambiae. Developed on the portable,
rapid, point-of-care compatible PCR platform - Genedrive® (genedrive® plc), the
test comprises two assays which target single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene that exert interactive effects on
knockdown resistance (kdr): L1014F, L1014S and N1575Y.
RESULTS: Distinct melt peaks were observed for each allele at each locus.
Preliminary validation of these assays using a test panel of 70 An. gambiae
samples showed complete agreement of our assays with the widely-used TaqMan
assays, achieving a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.
CONCLUSION: Here we show the development of an insecticide resistance detection
assay for use on the Genedrive® platform that has the potential to be the first
field-applicable diagnostic for kdr.
