Until recently, malaria vaccine development efforts have focused almost
exclusively on a handful of well characterized Plasmodium falciparum antigens.
Despite dedicated work by many researchers on different continents spanning more 
than half a century, a successful malaria vaccine remains elusive. Sequencing of 
the P. falciparum genome has revealed more than five thousand genes, providing
the foundation for systematic approaches to discover candidate vaccine antigens. 
We are taking advantage of this wealth of information to discover new antigens
that may be more effective vaccine targets. Herein, we describe different
approaches to large-scale screening of the P. falciparum genome to identify
targets of either antibody responses or T cell responses using human specimens
collected in Controlled Human Malaria Infections (CHMI) or under conditions of
natural exposure in the field. These genome, proteome and transcriptome based
approaches offer enormous potential for the development of an efficacious malaria
vaccine.
