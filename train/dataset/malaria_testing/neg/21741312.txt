The protein translation machinery of the parasite Plasmodium is the target of
important anti-malarial drugs, and encompasses many promising targets for future 
drugs. Plasmodium parasites have three subcellular compartments that house
genomes; the nucleus, mitochondrion and apicoplast, and each requires its own
compartmentalized transcription and translation apparatus for survival. Despite
the availability of the complete genome sequence that should reveal the requisite
elements for all three compartments, our understanding of the translation
machineries is patchy. We review what is known about cytosolic and organellar
translation in Plasmodium and discuss the molecules that have been identified
through genome sequencing and post-genomic analysis. Some translation components 
are yet to be found in Plasmodium, whereas others appear to be shared between
translationally active organelles.
