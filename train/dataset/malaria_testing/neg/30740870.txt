BACKGROUND: Vector control is the main intervention in malaria control and
elimination strategies. However, the development of insecticide resistance is one
of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis
populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid
deltamethrin. Although an L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in
the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of
resistance indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this
study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess
differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An.
arabiensis field populations - Asendabo, Chewaka and Tolay - and two susceptible 
strains - Sekoru and Mozambique.
RESULTS: Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a
glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4,
were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared
to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key
role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene
ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related
genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance. Although this did not
translate in increased thickness of the procuticle, a higher cuticular
hydrocarbon content was observed in a resistant population.
CONCLUSION: Our transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin and DDT resistant An.
arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance
mechanisms and paves the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle
composition in insecticide resistance of malaria vectors. © 2019 Society of
