Leishmania donovani is the major cause of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar), now
recognized as the parasitic disease with the highest level of mortality second
only to malaria. No human vaccine is currently available. A 36 kDa L. donovani
nucleoside hydrolase (LdNH36) surface protein has been previously identified as a
potential vaccine candidate antigen. Here we present data on the expression of
LdNH36 in Pichia pastoris and its purification at the 20 L scale to establish
suitability for future pilot scale manufacturing. To improve efficiency of
process development and ensure reproducibility, 4 N-linked glycosylation sites
shown to contribute to heterogeneous high-mannose glycosylation were mutated to
glutamine residues. The mutant LdNH36 (LdNH36-dg2) was expressed and purified to 
homogeneity. Size exclusion chromatography and light scattering demonstrated that
LdNH36-dg2 existed as a tetramer in solution, similar to the wild-type
recombinant L. major nucleoside hydrolase. The amino acid mutations do not affect
the tetrameric interface as confirmed by theoretical modeling, and the mutated
amino acids are located outside the major immunogenic domain. Immunogenic
properties of the LdNH36-dg2 recombinant protein were evaluated in BALB/c mice
using formulations that included a synthetic CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, together
with a microparticle delivery platform (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)). Mice
exhibited high levels of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies that were reactive to 
both LdNH36-dg2 and LdNH36 wild-type. While the point mutations did affect the
hydrolase activity of the enzyme, the IgG antibodies elicited by LdNH36-dg2 were 
shown to inhibit the hydrolase activity of the wild-type LdNH36. The results
indicate that LdNH36-dg2 as expressed in and purified from P. pastoris is
suitable for further scale-up, manufacturing, and testing in support of future
first-in-humans phase 1 clinical trials.
