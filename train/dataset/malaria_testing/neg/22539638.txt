Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are major effectors of calcium
signaling in apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma and Plasmodium and control
important processes of the parasite life cycle. Despite recently reported crystal
structures of Toxoplasma gondii (Tg)CDPKs, several important questions about
their regulation remain unanswered. Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)CDPK1 has emerged
as a key player in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, as it may be involved 
in the invasion of the host cells. Molecular modeling and site-directed
mutagenesis studies on PfCDPK1 suggested that several residues in the regulatory 
domain play a dual role, as they seem to contribute to the stabilization of both 
the active and inactive kinase. Mass spectrometry revealed that PfCDPK1 was
autophosphorylated at several sites; some of these were placed at strategic
locations and therefore were found to be critical for kinase activation. The
N-terminal extension of PfCDPK1 was found to be important for PfCDPK1 activation.
Unexpectedly, an ATP binding site in the NTE of PfCDPK1 was identified. Our
studies highlight several novel features of PfCDPK1 regulation, which may be
shared by other members of the CDPK family. These findings may also aid design of
inhibitors against these important targets, which are absent from the host.
