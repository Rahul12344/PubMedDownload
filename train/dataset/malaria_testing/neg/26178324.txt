BACKGROUND: Recent studies have described natural human infections of the
non-human primate parasites Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium cynomolgi. In
Southeast Asia, mosquitoes of the Anopheles leucosphyrus group bite both humans
and monkeys in the forest and thus offer a possible route for Plasmodium species 
to bridge the species barrier. In this study we analysed the species composition 
of malarial sporozoites infecting the salivary glands of Anopheles dirus in order
to determine their potential role as bridge vectors of Plasmodium parasites from 
monkeys to humans.
METHODS: Mosquitoes were collected in the forest and forest fringe area of Khanh 
Phu commune by human-baited landing collection. Anopheles species were determined
on the basis of morphologic features. Sporozoite-infected salivary glands were
applied to filter paper and dried in an ambient atmosphere, before storage in
closed vials at 4-6 °C. Detection and identification of Plasmodium species in
salivary glands were carried out by nested-PCR of the small subunit ribosomal RNA
gene.
RESULTS: Six species of Plasmodium parasites were detected by PCR, of which P.
vivax was the most common, followed by P. knowlesi, P. inui, P. cynomolgi, P.
coatneyi and P. falciparum. Twenty-six of the 79 sporozoite infected mosquitoes
showed multiple infections, most of which were a combination of P. vivax with one
or more of the non-human primate Plasmodium species.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that humans overnighting in this forest are
frequently inoculated with both human and non-human primate malaria parasites,
leading to a situation conducive for the emergence of novel zoonotic malaria.
