BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is one of the monkey malaria parasites that can
cause human malaria. The Duffy binding protein of P. knowlesi (PkDBPαII) is
essential for the parasite's invasion into human and monkey erythrocytes. A
previous study on P. knowlesi clinical isolates from Peninsular Malaysia reported
high level of genetic diversity in the PkDBPαII. Furthermore, 36 amino acid
haplotypes were identified and these haplotypes could be separated into allele
group I and allele group II. In the present study, the PkDBPαII of clinical
isolates from the Malaysian states of Sarawak and Sabah in North Borneo was
investigated, and compared with the PkDBPαII of Peninsular Malaysia isolates.
METHODS: Blood samples from 28 knowlesi malaria patients were used. These samples
were collected between 2011 and 2013 from hospitals in North Borneo. The PkDBPαII
region of the isolates was amplified by PCR, cloned into Escherichia coli, and
sequenced. The genetic diversity, natural selection and phylogenetics of PkDBPαII
haplotypes were analysed using MEGA5 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.00 programmes.
RESULTS: Forty-nine PkDBPαII sequences were obtained. Comparison at the
nucleotide level against P. knowlesi strain H as reference sequence revealed 58
synonymous and 102 non-synonymous mutations. Analysis on these mutations showed
that PkDBPαII was under purifying (negative) selection. At the amino acid level, 
38 different PkDBPαII haplotypes were identified. Twelve of the 28 blood samples 
had mixed haplotype infections. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the
haplotypes were in allele group I, but they formed a sub-group that was distinct 
from those of Peninsular Malaysia. Wright's FST fixation index indicated high
genetic differentiation between the North Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia
haplotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report the genetic diversity and natural 
selection of PkDBPαII of P. knowlesi from Borneo Island. The PkDBPαII haplotypes 
found in this study were distinct from those from Peninsular Malaysia. This
difference may not be attributed to geographical separation because other genetic
markers studied thus far such as the P. knowlesi circumsporozoite protein gene
and small subunit ribosomal RNA do not display such differentiation. Immune
evasion may possibly be the reason for the differentiation.
