Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a replication-deficient poxvirus,
attenuated in chick embryo fibroblast primary cells. It has been utilised as a
viral vector to develop many vaccines against cancer and infectious diseases such
as malaria, HIV/AIDS, influenza, and tuberculosis, MERS-CoV, and Ebola virus
infection. There is accumulating data from many preclinical and clinical studies 
that highlights the excellent safety and immunogenicity of MVA. However, due to
the complex nature of many pathogens and their pathogenicity, MVA vectored
vaccine candidates need to be optimised to improve their immunogenicity. One of
the main approaches to improve MVA immunogenicity focuses on optimising poxviral 
promoters that drive recombinant vaccine antigens, encoded within recombinant MVA
vector genome. A number of promoters were described or optimised to improve the
development of MVA based vaccines such as p7.5, pF11, and mH5 promoters. This
review focuses on poxviral promoters, their optimisation, genetic stability, and 
clinical use.
