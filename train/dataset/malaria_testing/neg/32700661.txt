Chikungunya fever is a viral mosquito-borne, acute febrile illness associated
with rash, joint pain, and occasionally prolonged polyarthritis. Chikungunya
outbreaks have been reported worldwide including many provinces of Thailand.
Although chikungunya virus (CHIKV) occurs in Thailand, details on its
epidemiology are lacking compared with dengue, a common mosquito-borne disease in
the country. Therefore, study on CHIKV and its epidemiology in both humans and
mosquitoes is required to better understand its importance clinically and
dynamics in community settings. So a prospective examination of virus circulation
in human and mosquito populations in northeastern Thailand using serological and 
molecular methods, including the genetic characterization of the virus, was
undertaken. The study was conducted among febrile patients in eight district
hospitals in northeastern Thailand from June 2016 to October 2017. Using
real-time PCR on the conserved region of nonstructural protein 1 gene, CHIKV was 
detected in eight (4.9%) of 161 plasma samples. Only one strain yielded a
sequence of sufficient size allowing for phylogenetic analysis. In addition,
anti-CHIKV IgM and IgG were detected in six (3.7%) and 17 (10.6%) patient plasma 
samples. The single sequenced sample belonged to the East/Central/South Africa
(ECSA) genotype and was phylogenetically similar to the Indian Ocean sub-lineage.
Adult Aedes mosquitoes were collected indoors and within a 100-m radius from the 
index case house and four neighboring houses. CHIKV was detected in two of 70
(2.9%) female Aedes aegypti mosquito pools. This study clearly demonstrated the
presence and local transmission of the ECSA genotype of CHIKV in the northeastern
region of Thailand.
