Objective: Parasites of the genus Plasmodium cause a great deal of morbidity and 
mortality worldwide, largely in regions with limited access and indication to the
tools necessary to control mosquito populations and to treat human infections of 
malaria. Five species of this class of eukaryotic pathogens cause different human
diseases, with Plasmodium falciparum alone infecting approximately 500 million
people per year and resulting in approximately one million deaths.
Materials and Methods: The two genes encoding the Shewanella-like protein
phosphatases of P. falciparum, SHLP1 and SHLP2, are conserved among members of
Plasmodiidae family. SHLP is frequently found in asexual blood stages and
expressed at all stages of the life cycle of parasite. SHLP deletion results in a
reduction in microneme formation, ookinetes (zygote) development, and complete
ablation of oocyst formation, thereby blocking transmission of parasite.
Structure modeling of SHLP protein can be helpful in understanding the active
site and binding site information and hence can be used for drug designing and
for therapeutics against malaria. Study of SHLP and its variants was carried out 
using UniProtKB database. Homology modeling was performed using Schr√∂dinger
software, and the modeled structure was verified using Ramachandran plot. Ten
antioxidants were searched in PubChem database for docking and comparative
analysis. Docking was carried out against SHLP-modeled protein, and the
ligand-protein interaction map was analyzed. Effective role of resveratrol was
studied against SHLP protein using docking method to identify protein-ligand
interaction scheme and bond formation.
Results: SHLP protein was modeled and docking was carried out to identify the
binding sites and interaction with the SHLP protein. Docking study suggested that
resveratrol has a strong interaction with SHLP protein and can be used as a
potential ligand for drug designing.
Conclusion: SHLP plays a crucial role in ookinetes and microneme development in
Plasmodium; hence ligand, which can interact and inhibit SHLP protein, can be a
potential drug against malarial parasite development. We studied the binding of
antioxidant, such as resveratrol, with this protein-using docking method and it
was found that resveratrol as an antioxidant can bind with the target SHLP
protein.
