Whole mitogenome sequences (mtDNA) have been exploited for insect ecology
studies, using them as molecular markers to reconstruct phylogenies, or to infer 
phylogeographic relationships and gene flow. Recent Anopheles phylogenomic
studies have provided information regarding the time of deep lineage divergences 
within the genus. Here we report the complete 15,393 bp mtDNA sequences of
Anopheles aquasalis, a Neotropical human malaria vector. When comparing its
structure and base composition with other relevant and available anopheline
mitogenomes, high similarity and conserved genomic features were observed.
Furthermore, 22 mtDNA sequences comprising anopheline and Dipteran sibling
species were analyzed to reconstruct phylogenies and estimate dates of divergence
between taxa. Phylogenetic analysis using complete mtDNA sequences suggests that 
A. aquasalis diverged from the Anopheles albitarsis complex ~28 million years ago
(MYA), and ~38 MYA from Anopheles darlingi. Bayesian analysis suggests that the
most recent ancestor of Nyssorhynchus and Anopheles + Cellia was extant ~83 MYA, 
corroborating current estimates of ~79-100 MYA. Additional sampling and
publication of African, Asian, and North American anopheline mitogenomes would
improve the resolution of the Anopheles phylogeny and clarify early continental
dispersal routes.
