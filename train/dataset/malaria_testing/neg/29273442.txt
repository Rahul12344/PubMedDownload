Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the causative agent of the Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The pandemic is believed to have originated
within the Northern Congo basin covering large parts of the Democratic Republic
of Congo, the Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon and
Gabon. Although over decades, HIV-1 has spread throughout the World leaving no
country unaffected, sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with more than 80% of
all infected individuals. The HIV-2 epidemic has largely remained restricted to
West Africa along the Upper Guinean forests. Co-incident with these regions of
highest HIV distribution is a part of the malaria belt and therefore,
co-infections are common. In this review we carve out the consequences of HIV
transmission prevention and synchronous malaria prophylaxis during occupational
or leisure travelling activities within this World region. In particular, we
elaborate on considering pre-existing drug resistances of both, the malaria
parasites and the immunodeficiency viruses, when determining a combination for
prophylactic and, if necessary, post-expositional measures with a focus on the
compatibility of both medications.
