The ability to introduce genetic constructs of choice into the genome of
Anopheles mosquitoes provides a valuable tool to study the molecular interactions
between the Plasmodium parasite and its insect host. In the long term, this
technology could potentially offer new ways to control vector-borne diseases
through the suppression of target mosquito populations or through the
introgression of traits that preclude pathogen transmission. Here, we describe in
detail protocols for the generation of transgenic Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes
based on germ-line transformation using either modified transposable elements or 
the site-specific PhiC31 recombinase.
