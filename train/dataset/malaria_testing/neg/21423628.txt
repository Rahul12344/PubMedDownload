SERA gene sequences were newly determined from 11 primate Plasmodium species
including two human parasites, P. ovale and P. malariae, and the evolutionary
history of SERA genes was analyzed together with 7 known species. All have one
each of Group I to III cysteine-type SERA genes and varying number of Group IV
serine-type SERA genes in tandem cluster. Notably, Group IV SERA genes were
ascertained in all mammalian parasite lineages; and in two primate parasite
lineages gene events such as duplication, truncation, fragmentation and gene loss
occurred at high frequency in a manner that mimics the birth-and-death evolution 
model. Transcription profile of individual SERA genes varied greatly among rodent
and monkey parasites. Results support the lineage-specific evolution of the
Plasmodium SERA gene family. These findings provide further impetus for studies
that could clarify/provide proof-of-concept that duplications of SERA genes were 
associated with the parasites' expansion of host range and the evolutionary
conundrums of multigene families in Plasmodium.
