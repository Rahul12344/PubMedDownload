A key factor affecting malaria vector control efforts in Cameroon is the rapid
expansion of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l (An. gambiae)
populations; however, mechanisms involved in insecticide resistance in forest
mosquito populations are still not well documented yet. The present study was
conducted to screen molecular mechanisms conferring insecticide resistance in An.
gambiae s.l. populations from the South Cameroon forest region. WHO bioassays
were conducted with F0 An. gambiae females aged three to four days from forest
(Sangmelima, Nyabessan, and Mbandjock) and urban sites (Yaoundé (Bastos and
Nkolondom)), against pyrethroids (permethrin 0.75% and deltamethrin 0.05%) and
carbamates (bendiocarb 0.1%). Members of the An. Gambiae s.l. species complex
were identified using molecular diagnostic tools. TaqMan assays were used to
screen for target site mutations. The expression profiles of eight genes
implicated in insecticide resistance were assessed using RT-qPCR. Cuticle
hydrocarbon lipids were measured to assess their potential implication in
insecticide resistance. Both An. Gambiae and An. coluzzii were detected. An.
gambiae was highly prevalent in Sangmelima, Nyabessan, Mbandjock, and Nkolondom. 
An. coluzzii was the only species found in the Yaoundé city center (Bastos). Low 
mortality rate to both pyrethroids and bendiocarb was recorded in all sites. High
frequency of L1014F allele (75.32-95.82%) and low frequencies of L1014S
(1.71-23.05%) and N1575Y (5.28-12.87%) were recorded. The G119S mutation
(14.22-35.5%) was detected for the first time in An. gambiae populations from
Cameroon. This mutation was rather absent from An. coluzzii populations. The
detoxification genes Cyp6m2, Cyp9k1, Cyp6p4, Cyp6z1, as well as Cyp4g16 which
catalyzes epicuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis, were found to be overexpressed
in at least one population. The total cuticular hydrocarvbon content, a proxy of 
cuticular resistance, did not show a pattern associated with pyrethroid
resistance in these populations. The rapid emergence of multiple resistance
mechanisms in An. Gambiae s.l. population from the South Cameroon forest region
is of big concern and could deeply affect the sustainability of insecticide-based
interventions strategies in this region.
