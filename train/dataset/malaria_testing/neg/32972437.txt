BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of
cancer-related death in China. The lack of an effective treatment for this
disease results in a high recurrence rate in patients who undergo radical tumor
resection, and the 5-year survival rate of these patients remains low. Our
previous studies demonstrated that Plasmodium infection provides a potent
antitumor effect by inducing innate and adaptive immunity in a murine Lewis lung 
carcinoma (LLC) model.
METHODS: This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of Plasmodium
infection on hepatocellular carcinoma in mice, and various techniques for gene
expression analysis were used to identify possible signal regulation mechanisms.
RESULTS: We found that Plasmodium infection efficiently inhibited tumor
progression and prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice, which served as a
murine implanted hepatoma model. The inhibition of tumor progression by
Plasmodium infection was related to suppression of tumor angiogenesis within the 
tumor tissue and decreased infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).
Further study demonstrated that matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP-9) produced by TAMs
contributed to tumor angiogenesis inÂ the tumor tissue and that the
parasite-induced reduction in MMP-9 expression in TAMs resulted in the
suppression of tumor angiogenesis. A mechanistic study revealed that the
Plasmodium-derived hemozoin (HZ) that accumulated in TAMs inhibited IGF-1
signaling through the PI3-K and MAPK signaling pathways and thereby decreased the
expression of MMP-9 in TAMs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that this novel approach of inhibiting tumor
angiogenesis by Plasmodium infection is of high importance for the development of
new therapies for cancer patients. Video abstract.
