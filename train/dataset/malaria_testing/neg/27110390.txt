Introduction. The characterization of genetic profile of Plasmodium isolates from
different areas could help in better strategies for malaria elimination. This
study aimed to compare P. falciparum diversity in two African countries. Methods.
Isolates collected from 100 and 73 falciparum malaria infections in sites of Côte
d'Ivoire (West Africa) and Gabon (Central Africa), respectively, were analyzed by
a nested PCR amplification of msp1 and msp2 genes. Results. The K1 allelic family
was widespread in Côte d'Ivoire (64.6%) and in Gabon (56.6%). For msp2, the 3D7
alleles were more prevalent (>70% in both countries) compared to FC27 alleles. In
Côte d'Ivoire, the frequencies of multiple infections with msp1 (45.1%) and msp2 
(40.3%) were higher than those found for isolates from Gabon, that is, 30.2% with
msp1 and 31.4% with msp2. The overall complexity of infection was 1.66 (SD =
0.79) in Côte d'Ivoire and 1.58 (SD = 0.83) in Gabon. It decreased with age in
Côte d'Ivoire in contrast to Gabon. Conclusion. Differences observed in some
allelic families and in complexity profile may suggest an impact of
epidemiological facies as well as immunological response on genetic variability
of P. falciparum.
