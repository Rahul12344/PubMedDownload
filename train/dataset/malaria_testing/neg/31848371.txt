A number of antimalarial drugs interfere with the electron transport chain and
heme-related reactions; however, the biosynthesis of heme derivatives in
Plasmodium parasites has not been fully elucidated. Here, we characterized the
steps that lead to the farnesylation of heme. After the identification of a gene 
encoding heme O synthase, we identified heme O synthesis in blood stage parasites
through the incorporation of radioactive precursors. The presence of heme O
synthesis in intraerythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum was confirmed by
mass spectrometry. Inabenfide and uniconazole-P appeared to interfere in heme
synthesis, accordingly, parasite growth was also affected by the addition of
these drugs. We conclude that heme O synthesis occurs in blood stage-P.
falciparum and this pathway could be a potential target for antimalarial drugs.
