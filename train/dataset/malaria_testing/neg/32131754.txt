BACKGROUND: In the Republic of Congo, hot temperature and seasons distortions
observed may impact the development of malaria parasites. We investigate the
variation of malaria cases, parasite density and the multiplicity of Plasmodium
falciparum infection throughout the year in Brazzaville.
METHODS: From May 2015 to May 2016, suspected patients with uncomplicated malaria
were enrolled at the Hôpital de Mfilou, CSI « Maman Mboualé», and the Laboratoire
National de Santé Publique. For each patient, thick blood was examined and
parasite density was calculated. After DNA isolation, MSP1 and MSP2 genes were
genotyped.
RESULTS: A total of 416, 259 and 131 patients with suspected malaria were
enrolled at the CSI «Maman Mboualé», Hôpital de Mfilou and the Laboratoire
National de Santé Publique respectively. Proportion of malaria cases and
geometric mean parasite density were higher at the CSI «Maman Mboualé» compared
to over sites (P-value <0.001). However the multiplicity of infection was higher 
at the Hôpital de Mfilou (P-value <0.001). At the Laboratoire National de Santé
Publique, malaria cases and multiplicity of infection were not influenced by
different seasons. However, variation of the mean parasite density was
statistically significant (P-value <0.01). Higher proportions of malaria cases
were found at the end of main rainy season either the beginning of the main dry
season at the Hôpital de Mfilou and the CSI «Maman Mboualé»; while, lowest
proportions were observed in September and January and in September and March
respectively. Higher mean parasite densities were found at the end of rainy
seasons with persistence at the beginning of dry seasons. The lowest mean
parasite densities were found during dry seasons, with persistence at the
beginning of rainy seasons. Fluctuation of the multiplicity of infection
throughout the year was observed without significance between seasons.
CONCLUSION: The current study suggests that malaria transmission is still
variable between the north and south parts of Brazzaville. Seasonal fluctuations 
of malaria cases and mean parasite densities were observed with some extension to
different seasons. Thus, both meteorological and entomological studies are needed
to update the season's periods as well as malaria transmission intensity in
Brazzaville.
