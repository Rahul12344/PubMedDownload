OBJECTIVE: To compare the laboratory tests of the imported Plasmodium ovale
infection and analyse the genetic character.
METHODS: After Giemsa staining and microscopy, CareStart rapid detection and
nested PCR were used to detect two cases with P. ovale infection returning from
Congo (Brazzaville) in Henan Province. Sequencing was performed after PCR
amplification using the 18S rRNA genus-specific primers. Their genetic
characteristics were analyzed and the sequence homology analysis was performed in
the NCBI.
RESULTS: The two cases were confirmed as P. ovale infection by morphological
examination microscopically. Amplified bands were produced by 18S rRNA nested
PCR, which was the same with P. ovale in size, whereas the results of CareStart
rapid detection test were all negative. A sequence of 906 bp in length was
obtained by sequencing their 18S rRNA genes in which GC accounted for 35.4%, and 
the sequence showed 99% homology to the corresponding part of the known P. ovale 
18S rRNA gene (GenBank accession No. AB182492).
CONCLUSION: Both the nested PCR and microscopy confirm the infection of P. ovale.
A negative result of CareStart rapid detection can not ruled out the Plasmodium
infection.
