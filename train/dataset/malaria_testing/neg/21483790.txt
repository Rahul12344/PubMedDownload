Upon invading the host erythrocyte, the human malaria parasite P. falciparum
lives and replicates within a membrane bound compartment referred to as the
parasitophorous vacuole. Recently, interest in this compartment and its protein
content has grown, due to the important roles these play in parasite egress and
protein traffic to the host cell. Surprisingly, the function of many proteins
within this compartment has not been experimentally addressed. Here, we study the
importance of one of these proteins, termed PfPV1, for intra-erythrocytic
parasite survival. Despite numerous attempts to inactivate the gene encoding
PfPV1, we were unable to recover deletion mutants. Control experiments verified
that the pv1 gene locus was per se open for gene targeting experiments, allowing 
us to exclude technical limitations in our experimental strategy. Our data
provide strong genetic evidence that PfPV1 is essential for survival of blood
stage P. falciparum, and further highlight the importance of parasitophorous
vacuole proteins in this part of the parasite's life cycle.
