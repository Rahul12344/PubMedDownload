The identification of Plasmodium species in Anopheles mosquitoes is an integral
component of malaria control programs. We developed a new assay to identify
Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium vivax variants.
Specific primers were designed to hybridize to CS gene-specific regions.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP) were used to distinguish the P. vivax variants VK210, VK247, and P.
vivax-like. The new PCR-RFLP assay revealed good agreement when compared with a
nested PCR using artificially infected Anopheles mosquitoes. This sensitive
PCR-RFLP method can be useful when detection of Plasmodium species and P. vivax
variants is required and may be employed to improve the understanding of malaria 
transmission dynamics by Anopheles species.
