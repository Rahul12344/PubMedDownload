OBJECTIVE: Rapid diagnostic tests have been of tremendous help in malaria control
in endemic areas, helping in diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases. It is
heavily relied upon in many endemic areas where microscopy cannot be obtained.
However, caution should be taken in the interpretation of its result in clinical 
setting due to its limitations and inherent weakness. This paper seeks to present
the varying malaria RDT test results, the possible interpretations and
explanation of these results common in endemic regions. Published works on
malaria RDT studies were identified using the following search terms "malaria RDT
in endemic areas", "Plasmodium falciparum and bacterial coinfection" "Plasmodium 
falciparum RDT test results in children in endemic areas" in Google Scholar and
PubMed.
RESULTS: The review results show that RDT positive results in febrile patients
can either be true or false positive. True positive, representing either a
possible single infection of Plasmodium or a co-infection of bacteria and P.
falciparum. False RDT negative results can be seen in febrile patient with P.
falciparum infection in prozone effect, Histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2) gene
deletion and faulty RDT kits. Hence, a scale up of laboratory facilities
especially expert microscopy and other diagnostic tools is imperative.
