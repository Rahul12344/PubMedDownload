Although the spleen is broadly accepted as the major lymphoid organ involved in
generating immune responses to the erythrocytic stages of the malaria parasite,
Plasmodium, human splenic tissue is not readily available in most cases. As a
result, most studies of malaria in humans rely on peripheral blood to assess
cellular immune responses to malaria. The suitability of peripheral blood as a
proxy for splenic immune responses is however unknown. Here, we have
simultaneously analysed the transcriptomes of whole blood and spleen over 12 days
of erythrocytic stage Plasmodium chabaudi infection in C57BL/6 mice. Using both
unsupervised and directed approaches, we compared gene expression between blood
and spleen over the course of infection. Taking advantage of publicly available
datasets, we used machine learning approaches to infer cell proportions and
cell-specific gene expression signatures from our whole tissue transcriptome
data. Our findings demonstrate that spleen and blood are quite dissimilar,
sharing only a small amount of transcriptional information between them, with
transcriptional differences in both cellular composition and transcriptional
activity. These results suggest that while blood transcriptome data may be useful
in defining surrogate markers of protection and pathology, they should not be
used to predict specific immune responses occurring in lymphoid organs.
