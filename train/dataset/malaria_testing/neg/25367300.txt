Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum K13-propeller domain have recently been
shown to be important determinants of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia.
This study investigated the prevalence of K13-propeller polymorphisms across
sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 1212 P. falciparum samples collected from 12
countries were sequenced. None of the K13-propeller mutations previously reported
in Southeast Asia were found, but 22 unique mutations were detected, of which 7
were nonsynonymous. Allele frequencies ranged between 1% and 3%. Three mutations 
were observed in >1 country, and the A578S was present in parasites from 5
countries. This study provides the baseline prevalence of K13-propeller mutations
in sub-Saharan Africa.
