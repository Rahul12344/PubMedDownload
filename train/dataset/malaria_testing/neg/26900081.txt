Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP) of Plasmodium falciparum have been
associated with altered drug sensitivity. Knowledge on MRP substrate specificity 
is indispensible for the characterization of resistance mechanisms and
identifying its physiological roles. An untargeted metabolomics approach detected
decreased folate concentrations in red blood cells infected with schizont stage
parasites lacking expression of MRP1. Furthermore, a tenfold decrease in
sensitivity toward the folate analog methotrexate was detected for parasites
lacking MRP1. PfMRP1 is involved in the export of folate from parasites into red 
blood cells and is therefore a relevant factor for efficient malaria treatment
through the folate pathway.
