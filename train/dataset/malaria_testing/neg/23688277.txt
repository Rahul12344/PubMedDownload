The function of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (PfCRT) 
can be quantified using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system [Baro, N. K.,
Pooput, C., and Roepe, P. D. (2011) Biochemistry 50, 6701-6710]. We further
optimized this system to distinguish PfCRT isoforms found in P. falciparum
strains and isolates from across the globe. We created and expressed 13 naturally
occurring pfcrt alleles associated with a range of chloroquine resistant (CQR)
phenotypes. Using galactose induction of PfCRT, we quantified PfCRT and
chloroquine (CQ)-dependent yeast growth inhibition and [3H]CQ transport
specifically due to a given PfCRT isoform. Surprisingly, we found poor
correlation between these parameters and the CQ IC50 observed in strains of
malaria harboring the same isoforms. This suggested that an increased level of CQ
transport due to PfCRT mutation is necessary, but not sufficient, for the range
of CQ IC50 values observed in globally distributed CQR P. falciparum isolates.
