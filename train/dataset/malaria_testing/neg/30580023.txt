Artemisinin derivatives and their partner drugs in artemisinin combination
therapies (ACTs) have played a pivotal role in global malaria mortality reduction
during the last two decades. The loss of artemisinin efficacy due to evolving
drug-resistant parasites could become a serious global health threat.
Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is a well tolerated and generally highly effective
ACT. The implementation of a partner drug in ACTs is critical in the control of
emerging artemisinin resistance. Even though artemisinin is highly effective in
parasite clearance, it is labile in the human body. A partner drug is necessary
for killing the remaining parasites when the pulses of artemisinin have ceased. A
population of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in Cambodia and adjacent countries 
has become resistant to piperaquine. Increased copy number of the genes encoding 
the haemoglobinases Plasmepsin II and Plasmepsin III has been linked with
piperaquine resistance by genome-wide association studies and in clinical trials,
leading to the use of increased plasmepsin II/plasmepsin III copy number as a
molecular marker for piperaquine resistance. Here we demonstrate that
overexpression of plasmepsin II and plasmepsin III in the 3D7 genetic background 
failed to change the susceptibility of P. falciparum to artemisinin, chloroquine 
and piperaquine by both a standard dose-response analysis and a piperaquine
survival assay. Whilst plasmepsin copy number polymorphism is currently
implemented as a molecular surveillance resistance marker, further studies to
discover the molecular basis of piperaquine resistance and potential epistatic
interactions are needed.
