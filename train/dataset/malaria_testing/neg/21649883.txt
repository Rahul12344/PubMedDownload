BACKGROUND: The mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, is the primary vector of human
malaria, a disease responsible for millions of deaths each year. To improve
strategies for controlling transmission of the causative parasite, Plasmodium
falciparum, we require a thorough understanding of the developmental mechanisms, 
physiological processes and evolutionary pressures affecting life-history traits 
in the mosquito. Identifying genes expressed in particular tissues or involved in
specific biological processes is an essential part of this process.
RESULTS: In this study, we present transcription profiles for ~82% of annotated
Anopheles genes in dissected adult male and female tissues. The sensitivity
afforded by examining dissected tissues found gene activity in an additional 20% 
of the genome that is undetected when using whole-animal samples. The somatic and
reproductive tissues we examined each displayed patterns of sexually dimorphic
and tissue-specific expression. By comparing expression profiles with Drosophila 
melanogaster we also assessed which genes are well conserved within the Diptera
versus those that are more recently evolved.
CONCLUSIONS: Our expression atlas and associated publicly available database, the
MozAtlas (http://www.tissue-atlas.org), provides information on the relative
strength and specificity of gene expression in several somatic and reproductive
tissues, isolated from a single strain grown under uniform conditions. The data
will serve as a reference for other mosquito researchers by providing a simple
method for identifying where genes are expressed in the adult, however, in
addition our resource will also provide insights into the evolutionary diversity 
associated with gene expression levels among species.
