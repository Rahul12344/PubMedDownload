INTRODUCTION: Self-amplifying mRNA vaccines are being developed as a platform
technology with potential to be used for a broad range of targets. The synthetic 
production methods for their manufacture, combined with the modern tools of
bioinformatics and synthetic biology, enable these vaccines to be produced
rapidly from an electronic gene sequence. Preclinical proof of concept has so far
been achieved for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rabies, Ebola,
cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and malaria.
AREAS COVERED: This editorial highlights the key milestones in the discovery and 
development of self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, and reviews how they might be used 
as a rapid response platform. The paper points out how future improvements in RNA
vector design and non-viral delivery may lead to decreases in effective dose and 
increases in production capacity.
EXPERT OPINION: The prospects for non-viral delivery of self-amplifying mRNA
vaccines are very promising. Like other types of nucleic acid vaccines, these
vaccines have the potential to draw on the positive attributes of live-attenuated
vaccines while obviating many potential safety limitations. Hence, this approach 
could enable the concept of vaccines on demand as a rapid response to a real
threat rather than the deployment of strategic stockpiles based on
epidemiological predictions for possible threats.
