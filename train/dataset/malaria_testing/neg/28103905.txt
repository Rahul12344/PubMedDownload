BACKGROUND: Genetic analyses of the malaria parasite population and its temporal 
and spatial dynamics could provide an assessment of the effectiveness of disease 
control strategies. The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been
poorly documented in Senegal, and limited data are available from the Kedougou
Region. This study examines the spatial and temporal variation of the genetic
diversity and complexity of P. falciparum infections in acute febrile patients in
Kedougou, southeastern Senegal. A total of 263 sera from patients presenting with
acute febrile illness and attending Kedougou health facilities between July 2009 
and July 2013 were obtained from a collection established as part of arbovirus
surveillance in Kedougou. Samples identified as P. falciparum by nested PCR were 
characterized for their genetic diversity and complexity using msp-1 and msp-2
polymorphic markers.
RESULTS: Samples containing only P. falciparum accounted for 60.83% (160/263) of 
the examined samples. All three msp-1 allelic families (K1, MAD20 and RO33) and
two msp-2 allelic families (FC27 and 3D7) were detected in all villages
investigated over the 5-year collection period. The average genotype per allelic 
family was comparable between villages. Frequencies of msp-1 and msp-2 allelic
types showed no correlation with age (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.59) or gender
(Fisher's exact test, P = 0.973), and were similarly distributed throughout the
5-year sampling period (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.412) and across villages
(Fisher's exact test, P = 0.866). Mean multiplicity of infection (MOI) for both
msp-1 and msp-2 was highest in Kedougou village (2.25 and 2.21, respectively) and
among younger patients aged ≤ 15 years (2.12 and 2.00, respectively). The mean
MOI was highest in 2009 and decreased progressively onward.
CONCLUSION: Characterization of the genetic diversity and complexity of P.
falciparum infections in Kedougou revealed no spatio-temporal variation in the
genetic diversity of P. falciparum isolates. However, mean MOI varied with time
of sera collection and decreased over the course of the study (July 2009 to July 
2013). This suggests a slow progressive decrease of malaria transmission
intensity in Kedougou Region despite the limited impact of preventive and control
measures implemented by the National Malaria Control Programme on malaria
morbidity and mortality.
