Although Orinoco goose (Neochen jubata) is an anatid species widely distributed
in South America, scarce are the reports on the occurrence of arthropod-borne
pathogens in this avian species. The present work aimed to verify, by serological
and molecular methods, the occurrence of haemosporida piroplasmids and
Anaplasmataceae agents in wild Orinoco geese captured in Brazil. Between 2010 and
2014, 62 blood samples were collected from free-living geese captured in the
Araguaia River, Goiás State, Brazil. Six geese (10%) were seropositive for
Anaplasma phagocytophilum, showing titers ranging from 40 and 80. Twenty out of
62 blood samples (32.25%) were positive in nested PCR for hemosporidia
(cytochrome b gene). Fifteen and five sequences shared identity with Haemoproteus
and Plasmodium, respectively. Six out of 62 blood samples (9.68%) were positive
in nested PCR for Babesia spp. (18S rRNA gene); one sequence showed to be closely
related to Babesia vogeli. Thirty (48.38%) out of 62 Orinoco geese blood samples 
were positive in nested cPCR assays for Anaplasmataceae agents (16S rRNA gene):
three for Anaplasma spp. and 27 for Ehrlichia. Six geese were simultaneously
positive to Haemoproteus and Ehrlichia; three animals were co-positive to
different Ehrlichia species/genotypes; and one goose sample was positive for both
Anaplasma and Ehrlichia. The present work showed the occurrence of Ehrlichia,
Anaplasma, Babesia, Plasmodium, and Haemoproteus species in free-living N. jubata
in Brazil. The threat of these arthropod-borne pathogens in Orinoco goose's
fitness, especially during the breading season, should be assessed in the future.
