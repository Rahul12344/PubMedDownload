BACKGROUND: Alterations in inflammatory cytokines and genetic background of the
host contribute to the outcome of malaria infection. Despite the promising
protective role of IL-17 in infections, little attention is given to further
understand its importance in the pathogenesis of severe malaria anaemia in
chronic/endemic situations. The objective of this study, therefore, was to
evaluate IL-17 levels in anaemic condition and its association with host genetic 
factors.
METHODS: Two mice strains (Balb/c and CBA) were crossed to get the F1 progeny,
and were (F1, Balb/c, CBA) taken through 6 cycles of Plasmodium berghei (ANKA
strain) infection and chloroquine/pyrimethamine treatment to generate semi-immune
status. Cytokine levels and kinetics of antibody production, CD4+CD25+T
regulatory cells were evaluated by bead-based multiplex assay kit, ELISA and
FACs, respectively.
RESULTS: High survival with high Hb loss at significantly low parasitaemia was
observed in Balb/c and F1. Furthermore, IgG levels were two times higher in
Balb/c, F1 than CBA. While CD4+CD25+ Treg cells were lower in CBA; IL-4, IFN-γ,
IL-12α and IL-17 were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in Balb/c, F1.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, elevated IL-17 levels together with high IL-4, IL-12α
and IFN-γ levels may be a marker of protection, and the mechanism may be
controlled by host factor (s). Further studies of F2 between the F1 and Balb/c
will be informative in evaluating if these genes are segregated or further apart.
