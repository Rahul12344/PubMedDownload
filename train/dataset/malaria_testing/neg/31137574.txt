Malaria is an infectious disease caused by Plasmodium group. The mechanisms of
antimalarial drugs DHA/CQ are still unclear today. The inhibitory effects (IC50) 
of single treatments with DHA/CQ or V-ATPase inhibitor Baf-A1 or combination
treatments by DHA/CQ combined with Baf-A1 on the growth of Plasmodium falciparum 
strain 3D7 was investigated. Intracellular cytoplasmic pH and labile iron pool
(LIP) were labeled by pH probe BCECF, AM and iron probe calcein, AM, the
fluorescence of the probes was measured by FCM. The effects of low doses of DHA
(0.2 nM, 0.4 nM, 0.8 nM) on gene expression of V-ATPases (vapE, vapA, vapG)
located in the membrane of DV were tested by RT-qPCR. DHA combined with Baf-A1
showed a synergism effect (CI = 0.524) on the parasite growth in the
concentration of IC50. Intracellular pH and irons were effected significantly by 
different doses of DHA/Baf-A1. Intracellular pH was decreased by CQ combined with
Baf-A1 in the concentration of IC50. Intracellular LIP was increased by DHA
combined with Baf-A1 in the concentration of 20 IC50. The expression of gene vapA
was down-regulated by all low doses of DHA (0.2/0.4/0.8 nM) significantly (p <
0.001) and the expression of vapG/vapE were up-regulated by 0.8 nM DHA
significantly (p < 0.001). Interacting with ferrous irons, affecting the DV
membrane proton pumping and acidic pH or cytoplasmic irons homeostasis may be the
antimalarial mechanism of DHA while CQ showed an effect on cytoplasmic pH of
parasite in vitro. Lastly, this article provides us preliminary results and a new
idea for antimalarial drugs combination and new potential antimalarial
combination therapies.
