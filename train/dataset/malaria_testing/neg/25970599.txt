BACKGROUND: Ixodes ricinus is the main tick vector of the microbes that cause
Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in Europe. Pathogens transmitted by
ticks have to overcome innate immunity barriers present in tick tissues,
including midgut, salivary glands epithelia and the hemocoel. Molecularly,
invertebrate immunity is initiated when pathogen recognition molecules trigger
serum or cellular signalling cascades leading to the production of
antimicrobials, pathogen opsonization and phagocytosis. We presently aimed at
identifying hemocyte transcripts from semi-engorged female I. ricinus ticks by
mass sequencing a hemocyte cDNA library and annotating immune-related transcripts
based on their hemocyte abundance as well as their ubiquitous distribution.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: De novo assembly of 926,596 pyrosequence reads
plus 49,328,982 Illumina reads (148 nt length) from a hemocyte library, together 
with over 189 million Illumina reads from salivary gland and midgut libraries,
generated 15,716 extracted coding sequences (CDS); these are displayed in an
annotated hyperlinked spreadsheet format. Read mapping allowed the identification
and annotation of tissue-enriched transcripts. A total of 327 transcripts were
found significantly over expressed in the hemocyte libraries, including those
coding for scavenger receptors, antimicrobial peptides, pathogen recognition
proteins, proteases and protease inhibitors. Vitellogenin and lipid metabolism
transcription enrichment suggests fat body components. We additionally annotated 
ubiquitously distributed transcripts associated with immune function, including
immune-associated signal transduction proteins and transcription factors,
including the STAT transcription factor.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first systems biology approach to describe 
the genes expressed in the haemocytes of this neglected disease vector. A total
of 2,860 coding sequences were deposited to GenBank, increasing to 27,547 the
number so far deposited by our previous transcriptome studies that serves as a
discovery platform for studies with I. ricinus biochemistry and physiology.
