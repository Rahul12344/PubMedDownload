Malaria transmission depends on sexual stage Plasmodium parasites successfully
invading Anopheline mosquito midguts following a blood meal. However, the
molecular mechanisms of Plasmodium invasion of mosquito midguts have not been
fully elucidated. Previously, we showed that genetic polymorphisms in the
fibrinogen-related protein 1 (FREP1) gene are significantly associated with
Plasmodium falciparum infection in Anopheles gambiae, and FREP1 is important for 
Plasmodium berghei infection of mosquitoes. Here we identify that the FREP1
protein is secreted from the mosquito midgut epithelium and integrated as
tetramers into the peritrophic matrix, a chitinous matrix formed inside the
midgut lumen after a blood meal feeding. Moreover, we show that the FREP1 can
directly bind Plasmodia sexual stage gametocytes and ookinetes. Notably, ablating
FREP1 expression or targeting FREP1 with antibodies significantly decreases P.
falciparum infection in mosquito midguts. Our data support that the
mosquito-expressed FREP1 mediates mosquito midgut invasion by multiple species of
Plasmodium parasites via anchoring ookinetes to the peritrophic matrix and
enabling parasites to penetrate the peritrophic matrix and the epithelium. Thus, 
targeting FREP1 can limit malaria transmission.
