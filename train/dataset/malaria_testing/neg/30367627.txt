BACKGROUND: Building on the declining trend of malaria in Ethiopia, the Federal
Ministry of Health aims to eliminate malaria by 2030. As Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax are co-endemic in Ethiopia, the use of primaquine is
indicated for both transmission interruption and radical cure, respectively.
However, the limited knowledge of the local prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and its associated variants has hindered the use 
of primaquine.
METHODS: Some 11,138 dried blood spot (DBS) samples were collected in 2011 as
part of a national, household Malaria Indicator Survey, a multi-stage nationally 
representative survey of all malaria-endemic areas of Ethiopia. A randomly
selected sub-set of 1414 DBS samples was successfully genotyped by polymerase
chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique.
Considering the geographical position and ethnic mix of the country, three common
variants: G6PD*A (A376G), G6PD*A- (G202A) and Mediterranean (C563T) were
investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 1998 randomly selected individuals, 1429 (71.5%) DBS samples were
genotyped and merged to the database, of which 53.5% were from females. G6PD*A
(A376G) was the only genotype detected. No sample was positive for either G6PD*A-
(G202A) or Mediterranean (C563T) variants. The prevalence of G6PD*A (A376G) was
8.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.7-11.2] ranging from 12.2% in the Southern
Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' (95% CI 5.7-18.7) to none in Dire Dawa/Harari
Region.
CONCLUSION: The common G6PD*A- (G202A) or Mediterranean (C563T) variants were not
observed in this nationwide study. The observed G6PD*A (A376G) mutation has
little or no clinical significance. These findings supported the adoption of
primaquine for P. falciparum transmission interruption and radical cure of P.
vivax in Ethiopia. As the presence of other clinically important, less common
variants cannot be ruled out, the implementation of radical cure will be
accompanied by active haematological and adverse events monitoring in Ethiopia.
