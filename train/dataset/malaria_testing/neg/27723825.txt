BACKGROUND: Despite the recent progress in establishing the patterns of
insecticide resistance in the major malaria vector Anopheles funestus, Central
African populations of this species remain largely uncharacterised. To bridge
this important gap and facilitate the implementation of suitable control
strategies against this vector, we characterised the resistance patterns of An.
funestus population from northern Cameroon.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Collection of indoor-resting female mosquitoes in Gounougou
(northern Cameroon) in 2012 and 2015 revealed a predominance of An. funestus
during dry season. WHO bioassays performed using F1 An. funestus revealed that
the population was multiple resistant to several insecticide classes including
pyrethroids (permethrin, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin and etofenprox),
carbamates (bendiocarb) and organochlorines (DDT and dieldrin). However, a full
susceptibility was observed against the organophosphate malathion. Bioassays
performed with 2015 collection revealed that resistance against pyrethroids and
DDT is increasing. PBO synergist assays revealed a significant recovery of
susceptibility for all pyrethroids but less for DDT. Analysis of the polymorphism
of a portion of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (VGSC) revealed the absence
of the L1014F/S kdr mutation but identified 3 novel amino acid changes I877L,
V881L and A1007S. However, no association was established between VGSC
polymorphism and pyrethroid/DDT resistance. The DDT resistant 119F-GSTe2 allele
(52%) and the dieldrin resistant 296S-RDL allele (45%) were detected in
Gounougou. Temporal analysis between 2006, 2012 and 2015 collections revealed
that the 119F-GSTe2 allele was relatively stable whereas a significant decrease
is observed for 296S-RDL allele.
CONCLUSION: This multiple resistance coupled with the temporal increased in
resistance intensity highlights the need to take urgent measures to prolong the
efficacy of current insecticide-based interventions against An. funestus in this 
African region.
