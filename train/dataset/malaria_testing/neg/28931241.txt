Background: Amplified copy number in the plasmepsin II/III genes within
Plasmodium falciparum has been associated with decreased sensitivity to
piperaquine. To examine this association and test whether additional loci might
also contribute, we performed a genome-wide association study of ex vivo P.
falciparum susceptibility to piperaquine.
Methods: Plasmodium falciparum DNA from 183 samples collected primarily from
Cambodia was genotyped at 33716 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs). Linear mixed models and random forests were used to estimate associations
between parasite genotypes and piperaquine susceptibility. Candidate
polymorphisms were evaluated for their association with
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment outcomes in an independent dataset.
Results: Single nucleotide polymorphisms on multiple chromosomes were associated 
with piperaquine 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC90) in a genome-wide analysis. 
Fine-mapping of genomic regions implicated in genome-wide analyses identified
multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with each other that were significantly
associated with piperaquine IC90, including a novel mutation within the gene
encoding the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter, PfCRT. This
mutation (F145I) was associated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment
failure after adjusting for the presence of amplified plasmepsin II/III, which
was also associated with decreased piperaquine sensitivity.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that, in addition to plasmepsin II/III copy number,
other loci, including pfcrt, may also be involved in piperaquine resistance.
