The development of pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium vivax vaccines is hindered by the 
lack of in vitro culture systems or experimental rodent models. To help bypass
these roadblocks, we exploited the fact that naturally exposed Fy- individuals
who lack the Duffy blood antigen (Fy) receptor are less likely to develop
blood-stage infections; therefore, they preferentially develop immune responses
to pre-erythrocytic-stage parasites, whereas Fy+ individuals experience both
liver- and blood-stage infections and develop immune responses to both
pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic parasites. We screened 60 endemic sera from P. 
vivax-exposed Fy+ or Fy- donors against a protein microarray containing 91 P.
vivax proteins with P. falciparum orthologs that were up-regulated in
sporozoites. Antibodies against 10 P. vivax antigens were identified in sera from
P. vivax-exposed individuals but not unexposed controls. This technology has
promising implications in the discovery of potential vaccine candidates against
P. vivax malaria.
