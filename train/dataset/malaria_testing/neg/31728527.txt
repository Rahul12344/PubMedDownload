Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms are central to the development and survival of
all eukaryotic organisms. These mechanisms critically depend on the marking of
chromatin domains with distinctive histone tail modifications (PTMs) and their
recognition by effector protein complexes. Here we used quantitative proteomic
approaches to unveil interactions between PTMs and associated reader protein
complexes of Plasmodium falciparum, a unicellular parasite causing malaria.
Histone peptide pull-downs with the most prominent and/or parasite-specific PTMs 
revealed the binding preference for 14 putative and novel reader proteins.
Amongst others, they highlighted the acetylation-level-dependent recruitment of
the BDP1/BDP2 complex and identified an PhD-finger protein (PHD 1, PF3D7_1008100)
that could mediate a cross-talk between H3K4me2/3 and H3K9ac marks. Tagging and
interaction proteomics of 12 identified proteins unveiled the composition of 5
major epigenetic complexes, including the elusive TBP-associated-factor complex
as well as two distinct GCN5/ADA2 complexes. Furthermore, it has highlighted a
remarkable degree of interaction between these five (sub)complexes. Collectively,
this study provides an extensive inventory of PTM-reader interactions and
composition of epigenetic complexes. It will not only fuel further explorations
of gene regulation amongst ancient eukaryotes, but also provides a stepping stone
for exploration of PTM-reader interactions for antimalarial drug development.
