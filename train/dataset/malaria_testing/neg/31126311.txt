BACKGROUND: Information on insecticide resistance and the mechanisms driving it
in the major malaria vectors is grossly lacking in Niger Republic, thus hindering
control efforts. To facilitate evidence-based malaria control, the role of
Anopheles coluzzii population from southern Niger, in malaria transmission, its
insecticides resistance profile and the molecular mechanisms driving the
resistance were characterized.
METHODS: Blood fed female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato resting indoor were
collected at Tessaoua, Niger. Source of blood was established using PCR and
infection with Plasmodium determined using TaqMan assay. Resistance profile was
established with the major public health insecticides, and resistance intensity
determined with deltamethrin. Synergist assays were conducted with piperonyl
butoxide and diethyl maleate. Presence of L1014F and L1014S knockdown resistance 
(kdr) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was investigated using
TaqMan genotyping, and strength of selection pressure acting on the Anopheles
populations determined by assessing the genetic diversity of a fragment spanning 
exon-20 of the VGSC from alive and dead females.
RESULTS: High human blood index (96%) and high Plasmodium falciparum infection
(~ 13%) was observed in the An. coluzzii population. Also, a single mosquito was 
found infected with Plasmodium vivax. High pyrethroid and organochloride
resistance was observed with mortalities of less than 20% for deltamethrin,
permethrin, α-cypermethrin, and DDT. A high LD50 (156.65 min) was obtained for
deltamethrin, with a resistance ratio of ~ 47.18 compared to the susceptible
Ngoussou colony. Moderate carbamate resistance was observed, and a full
susceptibility to organophosphates recorded. Synergist bioassays with piperonyl
butoxide and diethyl maleate significantly recovered deltamethrin and DDT
susceptibility, respectively implicating CYP450 s (mortality = 82%, χ2 = 84.51,
p < 0.0001) and glutathione S-transferases (mortality = 58%, χ2 = 33.96,
p < 0.001) in resistance. A high frequency of 1014F kdr mutation (82%) was
established, with significant difference in genotype distribution associated with
permethrin resistance [odds ratio = 7.71 (95% CI 2.43-14.53, χ2 = 13.67,
p = 0.001]. Sequencing of intron-1 of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC)
revealed a low genetic diversity.
CONCLUSION: High pyrethroid resistance highlight the challenges to the
effectiveness of the pyrethroids-based ITNs and indoor residual spraying (IRS)
against An. coluzzii in Niger. The pyrethroids-synergists LLINs and
organophosphate-based IRS maybe the alternatives for malaria control in southern 
Niger.
