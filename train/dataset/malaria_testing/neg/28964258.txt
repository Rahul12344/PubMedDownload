BACKGROUND: While intensive Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance
surveillance continues in Cambodia, relatively little is known about Plasmodium
vivax drug resistance in Cambodia or elsewhere. To investigate P. vivax
anti-malarial susceptibility in Cambodia, 76 fresh P. vivax isolates collected
from Oddar Meanchey (northern Cambodia) in 2013-2015 were assessed for ex vivo
drug susceptibility using the microscopy-based schizont maturation test (SMT) and
a Plasmodium pan-species lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) ELISA. P. vivax multidrug
resistance gene 1 (pvmdr1) mutations, and copy number were analysed in a subset
of isolates.
RESULTS: Ex vivo testing was interpretable in 80% of isolates using the
pLDH-ELISA, but only 25% with the SMT. Plasmodium vivax drug susceptibility by
pLDH-ELISA was directly compared with 58 P. falciparum isolates collected from
the same locations in 2013-4, tested by histidine-rich protein-2 ELISA. Median
pLDH-ELISA IC50 of P. vivax isolates was significantly lower for
dihydroartemisinin (3.4 vs 6.3 nM), artesunate (3.2 vs 5.7 nM), and chloroquine
(22.1 vs 103.8 nM) than P. falciparum but higher for mefloquine (92 vs 66 nM).
There were not significant differences for lumefantrine or doxycycline. Both P.
vivax and P. falciparum had comparable median piperaquine IC50 (106.5 vs
123.8 nM), but some P. falciparum isolates were able to grow in much higher
concentrations above the normal standard range used, attaining up to 100-fold
greater IC50s than P. vivax. A high percentage of P. vivax isolates had pvmdr1
Y976F (78%) and F1076L (83%) mutations but none had pvmdr1 amplification.
CONCLUSION: The findings of high P. vivax IC50 to mefloquine and piperaquine, but
not chloroquine, suggest significant drug pressure from drugs used to treat
multidrug resistant P. falciparum in Cambodia. Plasmodium vivax isolates are
frequently exposed to mefloquine and piperaquine due to mixed infections and the 
long elimination half-life of these drugs. Difficulty distinguishing infection
due to relapsing hypnozoites versus blood-stage recrudescence complicates
clinical detection of P. vivax resistance, while well-validated molecular markers
of chloroquine resistance remain elusive. The pLDH assay may be a useful
adjunctive tool for monitoring for emerging drug resistance, though more thorough
validation is needed. Given high grade clinical chloroquine resistance observed
recently in neighbouring countries, low chloroquine IC50 values seen here should 
not be interpreted as susceptibility in the absence of clinical data.
Incorporating pLDH monitoring with therapeutic efficacy studies for individuals
with P. vivax will help to further validate this field-expedient method.
