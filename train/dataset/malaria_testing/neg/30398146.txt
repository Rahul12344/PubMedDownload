In most of India, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus artesunate serves as
first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. In 112 clinical
Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Mangaluru, southwestern India, we sequenced
molecular markers associated with resistance to SP, lumefantrine, and artemisinin
(pfdhfr, pfdhps, pfmdr1, and K13). The pfdhfr double mutation 59R-108N combined
with the dhps 437G mutation occurred in 39.3% and the pfdhfr double mutation plus
the pfdhps double mutation 437G-540E in additional 24.1%. As for pfmdr1, the
allele combination N86-184F-D1246 dominated (98.2%). K13 variants were absent. No
evidence for artemisinin resistance was seen. However, the antifolate resistance 
alleles compromise the current first-line antimalarial sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine 
plus artesunate, which may facilitate the emergence of artemisinin resistance.
Artemether-lumefantrine, introduced in northeastern parts of the country, in the 
study area faces the predominant pfmdr1 NFD genotype, known to impair
lumefantrine efficacy. Further monitoring of resistance alleles and treatment
trials on alternative artemisinin-based combination therapies are required.
