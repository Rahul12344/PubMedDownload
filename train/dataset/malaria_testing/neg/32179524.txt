Malaria parasites invade and replicate within red blood cells (RBCs), extensively
modifying their structure and gaining access to the extracellular environment by 
placing the plasmodial surface anion channel (PSAC) into the RBC membrane.
Expression of members of the cytoadherence linked antigen gene 3 (clag3) family
is required for PSAC activity, a process that is regulated epigenetically. PSAC
is a well-established route of uptake for large, hydrophilic antimalarial
compounds, and parasites can acquire resistance by silencing clag3 gene
expression, thereby reducing drug uptake. We found that exposure to sub-IC50
concentrations of the histone methyltransferase inhibitor chaetocin caused
substantial changes in both clag3 gene expression and RBC permeability, and
reversed acquired resistance to the antimalarial compound blasticidin S that is
transported through PSACs. Chaetocin treatment also altered progression of
parasites through their replicative cycle, presumably by changing their ability
to modify chromatin appropriately to enable DNA replication. These results
indicate that targeting histone modifiers could represent a novel tool for
reversing epigenetically acquired drug resistance in P. falciparum.
