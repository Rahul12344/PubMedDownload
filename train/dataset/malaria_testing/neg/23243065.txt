The life cycles of apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium spp. and Toxoplasma 
gondii are complex, consisting of proliferative and latent stages within multiple
hosts. Dramatic transformations take place during the cycles, and they demand
precise control of gene expression at all levels, including translation. This
review focuses on the mechanisms that regulate translational control in
Plasmodium and Toxoplasma, with a particular emphasis on the phosphorylation of
the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α).
Phosphorylation of eIF2α (eIF2α∼P) is a conserved mechanism that eukaryotic cells
use to repress global protein synthesis while enhancing gene-specific translation
of a subset of mRNAs. Elevated levels of eIF2α∼P have been observed during latent
stages in both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, indicating that translational control
plays a role in maintaining dormancy. Parasite-specific eIF2α kinases and
phosphatases are also required for proper developmental transitions and
adaptation to cellular stresses encountered during the life cycle. Identification
of small-molecule inhibitors of apicomplexan eIF2α kinases may selectively
interfere with parasite translational control and lead to the development of new 
therapies to treat malaria and toxoplasmosis.
