North Borneo is home to more than 40 native populations. These natives are
believed to have undergone local adaptation in response to environmental
challenges such as the mosquito-abundant tropical rainforest. We attempted to
trace the footprints of natural selection from the genomic data of North Borneo
(NB) native populations using a panel of ∼2.2 million genome-wide single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). As a result, an ∼13 kb haplotype in the Major
Histocompatibility (MHC) Class II region encompassing candidate genes TSBP1 -
BTNL2 - HLA-DRA was identified to be undergoing natural selection. This putative 
signature of positive selection is shared among the five NB populations and is
estimated to have arisen ∼5.5 thousand years (∼220 generations) ago, which
coincides with the period of Austronesian expansion. Owing to the long history of
endemic malaria in NB, the putative signature of positive selection is postulated
to be driven by Plasmodium parasite infection. The findings of this study imply
that despite high levels of genetic differentiation, the NB populations might
have experienced similar local genetic adaptation resulting from stresses of the 
shared environment.
