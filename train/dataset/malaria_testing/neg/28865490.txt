BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in the major
African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and An. arabiensis may
compromise the current vector control interventions and threatens the global
malaria control and elimination efforts.
METHODS: Insecticide resistance was monitored in several study sites in Ethiopia 
from 2013 to 2015 using papers impregnated with discriminating concentrations of 
DDT, deltamethrin, bendiocarb, propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion and
pirimiphos-methyl, following the WHO insecticide susceptibility test procedure.
Mosquitoes sampled from different localities for WHO bioassay were
morphologically identified as An. gambiae (s.l.) using standard taxonomic keys.
Samples were identified to species using species-specific polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) and screened for the presence of target site mutations L1014F,
L1014S and N1575Y in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene and G119S in
the acethylcholinesterase (AChE) gene using allele-specific PCR. Biochemical
assays were performed to assess elevated levels of acetylcholinesterases,
carboxylcholinesterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450s
monooxygenases in wild populations of An. arabiensis, compared to the fully
susceptible Sekoru An. arabiensis laboratory strain.
RESULTS: Populations of An. arabiensis were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin but
were susceptible to fenitrothion in all the study sites. Reduced susceptibility
to malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, propoxur and bendiocarb was observed in some of 
the study sites. Knockdown resistance (kdr L1014F) was detected in all mosquito
populations with allele frequency ranging from 42 to 91%. Elevated levels of
glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) were detected in some of the mosquito
populations. However, no elevated levels of monooxygenases and esterases were
detected in any of the populations assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: Anopheles arabiensis populations from all surveyed sites in Ethiopia
exhibited resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Moreover, some mosquito
populations exhibited resistance to propoxur and possible resistance to
bendiocarb. Target site mutation kdr L1014F was detected in all mosquito
populations while elevated levels of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) was
detected in some mosquito populations. The reduced susceptibility of An.
arabiensis to propoxur and bendiocarb, which are currently used for indoor
residual spraying (IRS) in Ethiopia, calls for continuous resistance monitoring, 
in order to plan and implement evidence based insecticide resistance management.
