BACKGROUND: Mutations in the Plasmodium falciparum k13 gene are associated with
artemisinin (ART) resistance. However, it is unclear whether the F446I mutation, 
the most prevalent allele at the China-Myanmar border and north of Myanmar, is
associated with ART resistance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
investigate the role of this mutation in ART resistance by generating transgenic 
parasites expressing the F446I mutant allele.
METHODS: The transgenic parasites carrying the F446I or C580Y mutation in both
3D7 and FCC1/HN isolates were generated by single crossing-over recombination and
verified using PCR and gene sequencing. The ring-stage survival assay of 0-3 h
(RSA0-3 h) was used to evaluate ART susceptibility of the transgenic parasites in
vitro.
RESULTS: Four transgenic parasite lines named 3D7F446I mut, 3D7C580Y mut,
FCC1/HNF446I mut and FCC1/HNC580Y mut were successfully generated. These parasite
lines showed no changes in the expression level of k13 when compared with their
parent parasite isolates. However, introduction of the F446I mutation in k13 of
the 3D7 and FCC1/HN isolates led to elevated ring survival rates detected using
RSA0-3 h when subjected to both 700 and 20 nM concentrations of
dihydroartemisinin. The survival rates were similar to those detected in the
parasite lines with the C580Y mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Insertion of the F446I mutation in k13 led to increased ring
survival, suggesting that this mutation may be associated with ART resistance and
could be used as a molecular marker for monitoring ART-resistant parasites. The
results also highlights the importance of surveillance of F446I mutants for
containing the resistant parasite.
