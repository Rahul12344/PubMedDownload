The mitochondrion of malaria parasites contains several clinically validated drug
targets. Within Plasmodium spp., the causative agents of malaria, the
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is only 6 kb long, being the smallest mitochondrial
genome among all eukaryotes. The mtDNA encodes only three proteins of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain and ∼27 small, fragmented rRNA genes
having lengths of 22-195 nucleotides. The rRNA fragments are thought to form a
mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), together with ribosomal proteins imported 
from the cytosol. The mitoribosome of Plasmodium falciparum is essential for
maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential and parasite viability.
However, the role of the mitoribosome in sustaining the metabolic status of the
parasite mitochondrion remains unclear. The small ribosomal subunit in P.
falciparum has 14 annotated mitoribosomal proteins, and employing a
CRISPR/Cas9-based conditional knockdown tool, here we verified the location and
tested the essentiality of three candidates (PfmtRPS12, PfmtRPS17, and
PfmtRPS18). Using immuno-EM, we provide evidence that the P. falciparum
mitoribosome is closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. Upon
knockdown of the mitoribosome, parasites became hypersensitive to inhibitors
targeting mitochondrial Complex III (bc 1), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD), 
and the F1F0-ATP synthase complex. Furthermore, the mitoribosome knockdown
blocked the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and reduced the cellular pool of
pyrimidine nucleotides. These results suggest that disruption of the P.
falciparum mitoribosome compromises the metabolic capacity of the mitochondrion, 
rendering the parasite hypersensitive to a panel of inhibitors that target
mitochondrial functions.
