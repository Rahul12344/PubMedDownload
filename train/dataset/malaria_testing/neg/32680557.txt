BACKGROUND: Accurate quantification of infection intensity is essential to
estimate infection patterns of avian haemosporidian parasites in order to
understand the evolution of host-parasite associations. Traditional microscopy is
cost-effective but requires high-quality blood smears and considerable
experience, while the widely used semi-quantitative qPCR methods are mostly
employed with ideal, laboratory-based golden samples and standard curves, which
may limit the comparison of parasitemia from different laboratories.
METHODS: Here we present a digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) protocol for absolute
quantification of avian haemosporidians in raptors. Novel primers were designed
that target a conserved fragment of a rRNA region of the mitochondrial genome of 
the parasites. Sensitivity and repeatability were evaluated compared to qPCR and 
other assays.
RESULTS: This ddPCR assay enables accurate quantification of haemosporidian
parasites belonging to Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon with minimum
infection quantities of 10-5 (i.e. one parasite copy in 105 host genomes) without
the use of standard curves. Quantities assessed by ddPCR were more accurate than 
qPCR using the same primers through reduction of non-specific amplification in
low-intensity samples. The ddPCR technique was more consistent among technical
duplicates and reactions, especially when infection intensities were low, and
this technique demonstrated equal sensitivity with high correspondence
(R2 = 0.97) compared to the widely used qPCR assay. Both ddPCR and qPCR
identified more positive samples than the standard nested PCR protocol for the
cytb gene used for barcoding avian haemosporidians.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a novel ddPCR assay enabling accurate quantification of
avian haemosporidians without golden samples or standard curves. This assay can
be used as a robust method for investigating infection patterns in different
host-parasite assemblages and can facilitate the comparison of results from
different laboratories.
