Ferroquine (FQ), a chloroquine (CQ) analog, is being developed to treat persons
with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In 146 P. falciparum field isolates from
western Kenya, we measured 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50); nM) of CQ and
FQ by a SYBR Green I in vitro assay. Reference clones included W2 (CQ resistant) 
and D6 (CQ sensitive). Mutation analysis was done for P. falciparum CQ-resistance
transporter gene (Pfcrt K76T). Median IC(50) values for FQ were lower than CQ for
field isolates and the W2 clone (both P < 0.05). The Pfcrt mutation (76T), which 
was detected in > 80% of isolates, conferred higher CQ IC(50) values (P < 0.05)
and modestly lower FQ IC(50) values (P < 0.05), versus Pfcrt wild type (K76). FQ 
is more potent than CQ against CQ-resistant P. falciparum field isolates and the 
W2 clone, and is less affected by Pfcrt 76T. These findings support the notion
that FQ could be useful in treating persons with P. falciparum malaria.
