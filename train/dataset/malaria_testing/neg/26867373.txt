WITH MYANMAR AND MALAYSIA.

During 2009 to 2010, a total of 408 blood samples collected from malaria patients
in Ranong (149) and Yala (259) Provinces, Thailand were investigated for
Plasmodium spp using microscopic examination. There are no statistical
differences in the prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax in samples collected 
from Ranong and Yala (46% vs 52%, and 54% vs 45%, respectively). Single
nucleotide polymorphism of codon 86 in pfmdr1 (encoding P. falciparum multidrug
resistance protein 1) was investigated among 75 samples of P. falciparum and 2
samples of P. knowlesi. A pfmdr1 N86Y mutation was detected in 1 out of 29
samples and 45 out of 46 samples obtained from Ranong and Yala Provinces,
respectively. It is interesting that pfmdr1 was detected in two P. knowlesi DNA
samples obtained previously from Ranong Province which was 99% homologous to
pfmdr1 obtained from falciparum parasites in the same area but the mutation was
not observed. The difference in multidrug resistance protein in Plasmodium
obtained from those two border areas of Thailand will be of use in monitoring
drug resistance in these border regions of the country.
