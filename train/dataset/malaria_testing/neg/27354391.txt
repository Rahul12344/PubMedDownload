Most severe Plasmodium falciparum infections are experienced by young children.
Severe symptoms are precipitated by vascular sequestration of parasites
expressing a particular subset of the polymorphic P. falciparum erythrocyte
membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) adhesion molecules. Parasites binding human
endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) through the CIDRα1 domain of certain PfEMP1
were recently associated with severe malaria in children. However, it has
remained unclear to which extend the EPCR-binding CIDRα1 domains epitomize PfEMP1
expressed in severe malaria. Here, we characterized the near full-length
transcripts dominating the var transcriptome in children with severe malaria and 
found that the only common feature of the encoded PfEMP1 was CIDRα1 domains. Such
genes were highly and dominantly expressed in both children with severe malarial 
anaemia and cerebral malaria. These observations support the hypothesis that the 
CIDRα1-EPCR interaction is key to the pathogenesis of severe malaria and
strengthen the rationale for pursuing a vaccine or adjunctive treatment aiming at
inhibiting or reducing the damaging effects of this interaction.
