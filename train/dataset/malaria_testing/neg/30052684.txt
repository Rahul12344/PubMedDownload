Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection contributes to both B-cell and
epithelial-cell malignancies. However, whether lytic EBV infection also
contributes to tumors is unclear, although the association between malaria
infection and Burkitt lymphomas (BLs) may involve excessive lytic EBV
replication. A particular variant of the viral promoter (Zp) that controls lytic 
EBV reactivation is over-represented, relative to its frequency in non-malignant 
tissue, in EBV-positive nasopharyngeal carcinomas and AIDS-related lymphomas. To 
date, no functional differences between the prototype Zp (Zp-P) and the
cancer-associated variant (Zp-V3) have been identified. Here we show that a
single nucleotide difference between the Zp-V3 and Zp-P promoters creates a
binding site for the cellular transcription factor, NFATc1, in the Zp-V3 (but not
Zp-P) variant, and greatly enhances Zp activity and lytic viral reactivation in
response to NFATc1-inducing stimuli such as B-cell receptor activation and
ionomycin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that restoring this NFATc1-motif to the
Zp-P variant in the context of the intact EBV B95.8 strain genome greatly
enhances lytic viral reactivation in response to the NFATc1-activating agent,
ionomycin, and this effect is blocked by the NFAT inhibitory agent, cyclosporine,
as well as NFATc1 siRNA. We also show that the Zp-V3 variant is over-represented 
in EBV-positive BLs and gastric cancers, and in EBV-transformed B-cell lines
derived from EBV-infected breast milk of Kenyan mothers that had malaria during
pregnancy. These results demonstrate that the Zp-V3 enhances EBV lytic
reactivation to physiologically-relevant stimuli, and suggest that increased
lytic infection may contribute to the increased prevalence of this variant in
EBV-associated malignancies.
