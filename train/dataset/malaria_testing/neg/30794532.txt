Cyclic nucleotide signalling is a major regulator of malaria parasite
differentiation. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) enzymes are known to control cyclic GMP 
(cGMP) levels in the parasite, but the mechanisms by which cyclic AMP (cAMP) is
regulated remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that Plasmodium falciparum
phosphodiesterase β (PDEβ) hydrolyses both cAMP and cGMP and is essential for
blood stage viability. Conditional gene disruption causes a profound reduction in
invasion of erythrocytes and rapid death of those merozoites that invade. We show
that this dual phenotype results from elevated cAMP levels and hyperactivation of
the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Phosphoproteomic analysis of PDEβ-null
parasites reveals a >2-fold increase in phosphorylation at over 200 phosphosites,
more than half of which conform to a PKA substrate consensus sequence. We
conclude that PDEβ plays a critical role in governing correct temporal activation
of PKA required for erythrocyte invasion, whilst suppressing untimely PKA
activation during early intra-erythrocytic development.
