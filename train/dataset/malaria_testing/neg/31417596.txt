Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone produced by Artemisia annua glandular
secretory trichomes, is the active ingredient in the most effective treatment for
uncomplicated malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Other
metabolites in A. annua or related species, particularly flavonoids, have been
proposed to either act as antimalarials on their own or act synergistically with 
artemisinin to enhance antimalarial activity. We identified a mutation that
disrupts the CHALCONE ISOMERASE 1 (CHI1) enzyme that is responsible for the
second committed step of flavonoid biosynthesis. Detailed metabolite profiling
revealed that chi1-1 lacks all major flavonoids but produces wild-type
artemisinin levels, making this mutant a useful tool to test the antiplasmodial
effects of flavonoids. We used whole-leaf extracts from chi1-1 and mutant lines
impaired in artemisinin production in bioactivity in vitro assays against
intraerythrocytic P. falciparum Dd2. We found that chi1-1 extracts did not differ
from wild-type extracts in antiplasmodial efficacy nor initial rate of cytocidal 
action. Furthermore, extracts from the A. annua cyp71av1-1 mutant and RNAi lines 
impaired in amorpha-4,11-diene synthase gene expression, which are both severely 
compromised in artemisinin biosynthesis but unaffected in flavonoid metabolism,
showed very low or no antiplasmodial activity. These results demonstrate that in 
vitro bioactivity against P. falciparum of flavonoids is negligible when compared
to that of artemisinin.
