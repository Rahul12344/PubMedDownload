BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is a major malaria vector in China and other
Southeast Asian countries, and it is becoming increasingly resistant to the
insecticides used for agriculture, net impregnation, and indoor residual spray.
Very limited genomic information on this species is available, which has hindered
the development of new tools for resistance surveillance and vector control. We
used the 454 GS FLX system and generated expressed sequence tag (EST) databases
of various life stages of An. sinensis, and we determined the transcriptional
differences between deltamethrin resistant and susceptible mosquitoes.
RESULTS: The 454 GS FLX transcriptome sequencing yielded a total of 624,559 reads
(average length of 290 bp) with the pooled An. sinensis mosquitoes across various
development stages. The de novo assembly generated 33,411 contigs with average
length of 493 bp. A total of 8,057 ESTs were generated with Gene Ontology (GO)
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation. A total of 2,131
ESTs were differentially expressed between deltamethrin resistant and susceptible
mosquitoes collected from the same field site in Jiangsu, China. Among these
differentially expressed ESTs, a total of 294 pathways were mapped to the KEGG
database, with the predominant ESTs belonging to metabolic pathways. Furthermore,
a total of 2,408 microsatellites and 15,496 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: The annotated EST and transcriptome databases provide a valuable
genomic resource for further genetic studies of this important malaria vector
species. The differentially expressed ESTs associated with insecticide resistance
identified in this study lay an important foundation for further functional
analysis. The identified microsatellite and SNP markers will provide useful tools
for future population genetic and comparative genomic analyses of malaria
vectors.
