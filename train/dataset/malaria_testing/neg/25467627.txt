The clag multigene family is strictly conserved in malaria parasites, but absent 
from neighboring genera of protozoan parasites. Early research pointed to roles
in merozoite invasion and infected cell cytoadherence, but more recent studies
have implicated channel-mediated uptake of ions and nutrients from host plasma.
Here, we review the current understanding of this gene family, which appears to
be central to host-parasite interactions and an important therapeutic target.
