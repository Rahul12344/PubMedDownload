OBJECTIVE: To study the in vivo efficacy of these two ACTs in the treatment of
Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum malaria) in Kolkata and to determine the
prevalence of mutant S769N codon of the PfATPase6 gene among field isolates of P.
falciparum collected from the study area.
METHODS: A total of 207P. falciparum positive cases were enrolled randomly in two
study arms and followed up for 42 days as per WHO (2009) protocol. A portion of
PfATPase6 gene spanning codon S769N was amplified and sequenced by direct
sequencing method.
RESULTS: It was observed that the efficacy of both the ACT regimens were highly
effective in the study area and no mutant S769N was detected from any isolate.
CONCLUSIONS: The used, combination AS+SP is effective and the other combination
AM+LF might be an alternative, if needed.
