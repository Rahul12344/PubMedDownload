BACKGROUND: Here, we created an automated pipeline for the de novoassembly of
genomes from Pacific Biosciences long-read and Illumina short-read data using
common workflow language (CWL). To evaluate the performance of this pipeline, we 
assembled the nuclear genomes of the eukaryotes Caenorhabditis elegans (∼100 Mb),
Drosophila melanogaster (∼138 Mb), and Plasmodium falciparum (∼23 Mb) directly
from publicly accessible nucleotide sequence datasets and assessed the quality of
the assemblies against curated reference genomes.
FINDINGS: We showed a dependency of the accuracy of assembly on sequencing
technology and GC content and repeatedly achieved assemblies that meet the high
standards set by the National Human Genome Research Institute, being applicable
to gene prediction and subsequent genomic analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: This CWL pipeline overcomes current challenges of achieving
repeatability and reproducibility of assembly results and offers a platform for
the re-use of the workflow and the integration of diverse datasets. This workflow
is publicly available via GitHub (https://github.com/vetscience/Assemblosis) and 
is currently applicable to the assembly of haploid and diploid genomes of
eukaryotes.
