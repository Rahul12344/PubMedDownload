Background: Studying malaria parasites cross resistance to
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole, 
CTX) is necessary in areas coendemic for malaria and HIV. Polymorphism and
frequency of drug resistance molecular markers, Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes have been
assessed in Plasmodium falciparum isolates from HIV-infected adults, in Gabon.
Materiel and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in three HIV care and
treatment centers, at Libreville, the capital city of Gabon and at Oyem and
Koulamoutou, two rural cities between March 2015 and June 2016. P.
falciparum-infected HIV adults were selected. Analysis of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes
was performed using high resolution melting (HRM) technique.
Results: Pfdhps A581G mutation was found in 23.5% (8/34) of the isolates. Triple 
Pfdhfr mutation (51I-59R-108N) was predominant (29.4%; n=10) while 17.6% (n=6) of
the isolates carried a quadruple mutation (Pfdhfr 51I-59R-108N + Pfdhps 437G;
Pfdhfr 51I-108N + Pfdhps 437G-Pfdhps581G; Pfdhfr 51I-59R-108N + Pfdhps 581G).
Highly resistant genotype was detected in around 10% (n=3) of the isolates. The
quintuple mutation (triple Pfdhfr 51I-59R-108N and double Pfdhps437-581) was only
found in isolates from two patients who did not use CTX. The most frequent
haplotypes were those with a single mutation (NCNIAKA) (36%) and a quadruple
mutation (NCIIGKG, NRIIGKA, and NRIIAKG). Mixed unknown genotypes were found at
codon 164 in three isolates. Mixed genotypes were more frequent at codons 51
(23.5%; n=8) and 59 (20.5%; n=7) (p<0.01).
Conclusion: Pfdhps A581G mutation as well as new combination of quintuple
mutations is found for the first time in isolates from HIV-infected patients in
Gabon in comparison to a previous study. The detection of these genotypes at a
nonnegligible frequency underlines the need of a regular surveillance of
antifolates drug resistance.
