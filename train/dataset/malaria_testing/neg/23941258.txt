Plasmodium knowlesi and HIV co-infection in a German traveller to Thailand.

Ehrhardt J, Trein A, Kremsner P, Frank M.

A case of Plasmodium knowlesi and HIV co-infection is reported in a German
traveller returning from Thailand. The 54 year-old patient presented to the
Institute of Tropical Medicine in Tübingen with a 11-day history of daily fever
and chills. Initial microscopic evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears
was suggestive of a mixed infection with Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium
malariae. However, PCR amplification of small subunit ribosomal RNA gene revealed
a P. knowlesi infection. Parasitaemia was 473 parasites/μl and the platelet count
was within the normal range. Oral treatment with Malarone® was initiated and
resulted in a fast recovery without any complications. As part of routine
screening the patient also underwent HIV testing and was found to be HIV positive
with a CD4 cell count of 115/μl and a viral load of 34,799 copies/ml. A follow-up
measurement of the viral load seven days after the first quantification revealed 
an increase to 102,000 copies/ml. Three months after the first quantification the
viral load had dropped to 10,000 copies/ml without the initiation of
antiretroviral treatment. This suggests the possibility of a P. knowlesi
malaria-induced temporary elevation of viral load similar to that reported for P.
falciparum and HIV co-infection.
