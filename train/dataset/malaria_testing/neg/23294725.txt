BACKGROUND: Resistance to chloroquine and antifolate drugs has evolved
independently in South America, suggesting that genotype - phenotype studies
aimed at understanding the genetic basis of resistance to these and other drugs
should be conducted in this continent. This research was conducted to better
understand the population structure of Colombian Plasmodium falciparum in
preparation for such studies.
RESULTS: A set of 384 SNPs were genotyped in blood spot DNA samples from 447 P.
falciparum infected subjects collected over a ten year period from four provinces
of the Colombian Pacific coast to evaluate clonality, population structure and
linkage disequilibrium (LD). Most infections (81%) contained a single predominant
clone. These clustered into 136 multilocus genotypes (MLGs), with 32% of MLGs
recovered from multiple (2 - 28) independent subjects. We observed extremely low 
genotypic richness (R = 0.42) and long persistence of MLGs through time
(median = 537 days, range = 1 - 2,997 days). There was a high probability (>5%)
of sampling parasites from the same MLG in different subjects within 28 days,
suggesting caution is needed when using genotyping methods to assess treatment
success in clinical drug trials. Panmixia was rejected as four well
differentiated subpopulations (FST = 0.084 - 0.279) were identified. These
occurred sympatrically but varied in frequency within the four provinces. Linkage
disequilibrium (LD) decayed more rapidly (r2 = 0.17 for markers <10 kb apart)
than observed previously in South American samples.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Colombian populations have several advantages for
association studies, because multiple clone infections are uncommon and LD decays
over the scale of one or a few genes. However, the extensive population structure
and low genotype richness will need to be accounted for when designing and
analyzing association studies.
