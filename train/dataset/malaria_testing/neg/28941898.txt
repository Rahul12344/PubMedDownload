A collaborative validation study was performed to evaluate the performance of a
new U.S. Food and Drug Administration method developed for detection of the
protozoan parasite, Cyclospora cayetanensis, on cilantro and raspberries. The
method includes a sample preparation step in which oocysts are recovered from
produce using an enhanced produce washing solution containing 0.1% Alconox and a 
commercially available method to disrupt the C. cayetanensis oocysts and extract 
DNA. A real-time PCR assay targeting the C. cayetanensis 18S rDNA gene with an
internal amplification control to monitor PCR inhibition provides
species-specific identification. Five laboratories blindly analyzed a total of
319 samples consisting of 25 g of cilantro or 50 g of raspberries which were
either uninoculated or artificially contaminated with C. cayetanensis oocysts.
Detection rates for cilantro inoculated with 200, 10, and 5 oocysts, were 100%,
80%, and 31%, respectively. For raspberries, the detection rates for samples
inoculated with 200, 10, and 5 oocysts were 100%, 90% and 50%, respectively. All 
uninoculated samples, DNA blank extracts, and no-template PCR controls were
negative. Reproducibility between laboratories and analysts was high and the
method was shown to be an effective analytical tool for detection of
C. cayetanensis in produce.
