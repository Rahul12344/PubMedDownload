BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs) as a good alternative malaria-diagnosis method in remote parts of
sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of commercial RDTs currently available detect
the Plasmodium falciparum protein histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2). There have
also been recent reports of pfhrp2 gene deletions being found in parasites
collected from several African countries. The WHO has concluded that lacking the 
pfhrp2 gene must be monitored in Africa. The purpose of the study was to analyse 
why the samples that were positive by PCR were negative by RDTs and, therefore,
to determine whether there have been deletions in the pfhrp2 and/or pfhrp3 genes.
METHODS: Malaria NM-PCR was carried out on all the samples collected in the
field. A group of 128 samples was positive by PCR but negative by RDT; these
samples were classified as RDT false-negatives. PCR was carried out for exon2 of 
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes to detect the presence or absence of these two genes.
Frequencies with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for prevalence
estimates. Associations were assessed by the Chi square test or Fisher´s exact
test. The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Statistical analyses were
performed using the software package SPSSv.15.0.
RESULTS: After PCR, 81 samples were identified (4.7%, 95% CI 3.8-5.8) which had
deletion in both genes, pfhrp2 and pfhrp3. Overall, however, 11 samples (0.6%,
95% CI 0.36-1.14) had deletion only in pfhrp2 but not in pfhrp3, and 15 (0.9%,
95% CI 0.6-1.5) presented with deletion only in pfhrp3 but not in pfhrp2.
Considering the pfhrp2 gene separately, within the total of 1724 samples, 92
(5.3%, 95% CI 4.37-6.5) had evidence of deletion.
CONCLUSION: The present study provides the first evidence of deletion in the
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes in P. falciparum isolates from Equatorial Guinea.
However, larger studies across different regions within the country and across
different seasonal profiles are needed to determine the full extent of pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3 deletion. It is strongly recommended to implement an active surveillance
programme in order to detect any increases in pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletion
frequencies.
