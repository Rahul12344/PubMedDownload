BACKGROUND: Mitochondria perform multiple roles in cell biology, acting as the
site of aerobic energy-transducing pathways and as an important source of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) that modulate redox metabolism.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrate that a novel member of the
mitochondrial transporter protein family, Anopheles gambiae mitochondrial carrier
1 (AgMC1), is required to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential in mosquito
midgut cells and modulates epithelial responses to Plasmodium infection. AgMC1
silencing reduces mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in increased
proton-leak and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. These metabolic changes 
reduce midgut ROS generation and increase A. gambiae susceptibility to Plasmodium
infection.
CONCLUSION: We provide direct experimental evidence indicating that ROS derived
from mitochondria can modulate mosquito epithelial responses to Plasmodium
infection.
