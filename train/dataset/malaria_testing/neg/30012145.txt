BACKGROUND: The resistance of Plasmodium vivax to chloroquine has become an
obstacle to control strategies based on the use of anti-malarials. The current
study investigated the association between P. vivax CQ-resistance in vivo with
copy number variation and mutations in the promoter region in pvcrt-o and pvmdr1 
genes.
METHODS: The study included patients with P. vivax that received supervised
treatment with chloroquine and primaquine. Recurrences were actively recorded
during this period.
RESULTS: Among the 60 patients with P. vivax, 25 were CQ-resistant and 35
CQ-susceptible. A frequency of 7.1% of multi-copy pvcrt-o was observed in
CQ-susceptible samples and 7.7% in CQ-resistant at D0 (P > 0.05) and 33.3% in
CQ-resistant at DR (P < 0.05). For pvmdr1, 10.7% of the CQ-susceptible samples
presented multiple copies compared to 11.1% in CQ-resistant at D0 and 0.0% in
CQ-resistant at DR (P > 0.05). A deletion of 19 bp was found in 11/23 (47.6%) of 
the patients with CQ-susceptible P. vivax and 3/10 (23.1%) of the samples with in
CQRPv at D0. At day DR, 55.5% of the samples with CQRPv had the 19 bp deletion.
For the pvmdr-1 gene, was no variation in the analysed gene compared to the P.
vivax reference Sal-1.
CONCLUSIONS: This was the first study with 42-day clinical follow-up to evaluate 
the variation of the number of copies and polymorphisms in the promoter region of
the pvcrt-o and pvmdr1 genes in relation to treatment outcomes. Significantly
higher frequency of multi-copy pvcrt-o was found in CQRPv samples at DR compared 
to CQ-susceptible, indicating parasite selection of this genotype after CQ
treatment and its association with CQ-resistance in vivo.
