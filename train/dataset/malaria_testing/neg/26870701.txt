MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs, have been
detected in a variety of organisms ranging from ancient unicellular eukaryotes to
mammals. They have been associated with numerous molecular mechanisms involving
developmental, physiological and pathological changes of cells and tissues.
Despite the fact that miRNA-silencing mechanisms appear to be absent in some
Apicomplexan species, an increasing number of studies have reported a role for
miRNAs in host-parasite interactions. Host miRNA expression can change following 
parasite infection and the consequences can lead, for instance, to parasite
clearance. In this context, the immune system signaling appears to have a crucial
role.
