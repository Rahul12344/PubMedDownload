We investigated the evolution of Pfcrt K76T mutation five years after the
withdrawal of chloroquine in Burkina Faso. A total of 675 clinical isolates
collected from October 2010 to September 2012 were successfully genotyped. Single
nucleotide polymorphism in Pfcrt (codon 76) gene was analyzed. The prevalence of 
resistant Pfcrt 76T allele was 20.55%. There was a progressive decrease of the
proportion of mutant type pfcrt T76 from 2010 to 2012 (X2=5.508 p=0.0189). Our
results suggest a progressive return of the wild type Pfcrt K76 in Burkina Faso
but the prevalence of the mutants Pfcrt T76 still remains high.
