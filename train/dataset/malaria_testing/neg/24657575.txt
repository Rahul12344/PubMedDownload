Mechanisms regulating gene expression in malaria parasites are not well
understood. Little is known about how the parasite regulates its gene expression 
during transition from one developmental stage to another and in response to
various environmental conditions. Parasites in a diseased host face environments 
which differ from the static, well adapted in vitro conditions. Parasites thus
need to adapt quickly and effectively to these conditions by establishing
transcriptional states which are best suited for better survival. With the
discovery of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) in this parasite and
considering the various proposed mechanisms by which NATs might regulate gene
expression, it has been speculated that these might be playing a critical role in
gene regulation. We report here the diversity of NATs in this parasite, using
isolates taken directly from patients with differing clinical symptoms caused by 
malaria infection. Using a custom designed strand specific whole genome
microarray, a total of 797 NATs targeted against annotated loci have been
detected. Out of these, 545 NATs are unique to this study. The majority of NATs
were positively correlated with the expression pattern of the sense transcript.
However, 96 genes showed a change in sense/antisense ratio on comparison between 
uncomplicated and complicated disease conditions. The antisense transcripts map
to a broad range of biochemical/metabolic pathways, especially pathways
pertaining to the central carbon metabolism and stress related pathways. Our data
strongly suggests that a large group of NATs detected here are unannotated
transcription units antisense to annotated gene models. The results reveal a
previously unknown set of NATs that prevails in this parasite, their differential
regulation in disease conditions and mapping to functionally well annotated
genes. The results detailed here call for studies to deduce the possible
mechanism of action of NATs, which would further help in understanding the in
vivo pathological adaptations of these parasites.
