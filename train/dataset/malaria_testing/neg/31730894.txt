OBJECTIVES: Epidemiology studies indicated that coke-oven workers with long-term 
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) often have some
neurobehavioral abnormalities especially impairment for cognitive function, while
the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Numerous studies have
indicated the antioxidant and anti-apoptosis roles of heat shock protein 70
(Hsp70). The genetic polymorphisms in HSP70 genes are associated with multiple
diseases including neurotoxicity. However, it is unclear whether HSP70
polymorphisms are related to the neurotoxicity of PAH. We, therefore, investigate
the possible association between HSP70 polymorphisms and neurobehavioral
abnormalities.
METHODS: 188 coke-oven workers and 137 control workers were recruited in this
study. Emotional and cognitive function was assessed using the WHO/NCTB. HSP70
polymorphisms (HSP70-1 G190C, HSP70-2 G1267 A and HSP70-hom T2437C) were checked 
by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: The results indicated that HSP70-1 CC genotypes in coke-oven workers
were associated with poor neurobehavioral performance such as the attention
/response speed and visual perception/memory, while the HSP70-2 AA genotypes were
associated with lower short-term auditory memory.
CONCLUSIONS: HSP70-1 CC and HSP70-2 AA genotypes in coke-oven workers may
increase the risk for neurobehavioral damage, especially attention, learning and 
memory.
