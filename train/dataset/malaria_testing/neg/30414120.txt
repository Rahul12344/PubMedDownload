The mosquito genome projects facilitated research in new facets of mosquito
biology, including functional genetic studies in the dengue and Zika virus vector
Aedes aegypti and the primary African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. RNA
interference (RNAi) has facilitated gene silencing experiments in both of these
disease vector mosquito species and could one day be applied as a new method of
vector control. Here, we describe a procedure for the genetic engineering of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) that express short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
corresponding to mosquito target genes of interest. Following cultivation, which 
facilitates inexpensive propagation of shRNA, the yeast is inactivated and
prepared in a ready-to-use dry tablet formulation that is fed to mosquito larvae.
Ingestion of the yeast tablets results in effective larval target gene silencing.
This technically straightforward and affordable technique may be applicable to a 
wide variety of mosquito species and potentially to other arthropods that feed on
yeast.
