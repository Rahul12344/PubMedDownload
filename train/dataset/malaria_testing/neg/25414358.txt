The previous release of our Full-parasites database (http://fullmal.hgc.jp/)
brought enhanced functionality, an expanded full-length cDNA content, and new
RNA-Seq datasets from several important apicomplexan parasites. The 2015 update
witnesses the major shift in the databases content with focus on diverse
transcriptomes of the apicomplexan parasites. The content of the database was
substantially enriched with transcriptome information for new apicomplexan
parasites. The latest version covers a total of 17 species, with addition of our 
newly generated RNA-Seq data of a total of 909,150,388 tags. Moreover, we have
generated and included two novel and unique datasets, which represent diverse
nature of transcriptomes in individual parasites in vivo and in vitro. One is the
data collected from 116 Indonesian patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. 
The other is a series of transcriptome data collected from a total of 38 single
cells of P. falciparum cultured in vitro. We believe that with the recent
advances our database becomes an even better resource and a unique platform in
the analysis of apicomplexan parasites and their interaction with their hosts. To
adequately reflect the recent modifications and the current content we have
changed the database name to DB-AT--DataBase of Apicomplexa Transcriptomes.
