Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes (iMO) are critical for host defense against
toxoplasmosis and malaria but their role in leishmaniasis is unclear. In this
study, we report a detrimental role of Ly6Chi iMOs in visceral leishmaniasis (VL)
caused by Leishmania donovani. We demonstrate that Ly6Chi iMOs are continuously
recruited into the spleen and liver during L. donovani infection and they are
preferential targets for the parasite. Using microarray-based gene expression
profiling, we show that Ly6Chi iMOs isolated from the infected liver and spleen
have distinct phenotypic and activation profiles. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that blocking the recruitment of Ly6Chi iMOs into the liver and spleen during L. 
donovani infection using a CCR2 antagonist reduces the frequency of the
pathogenic IFN-Î³/IL10 dual producer CD4+ T cells in the spleen and leads to a
significant reduction in parasite loads in the liver and spleen. Using STAT1-/-
mice we show that STAT1 is critical for mediating the recruitment of Ly6Chi iMOs 
into organs during L. donovani infection, and adaptive transfer of wild type
Ly6Chi iMOs into STAT1-/- recipients renders them susceptible to disease. Our
findings reveal an unexpected pathogenic role for Ly6Chi iMOs in promoting
parasite survival in VL and open the possibility of targeting this population for
host-directed therapy during VL.
