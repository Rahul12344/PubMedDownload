Effective control of Chagas disease vector populations requires a good
understanding of the epidemiological components, including a reliable analysis of
the genetic structure of vector populations. Rhodnius ecuadoriensis is the most
widespread vector of Chagas disease in Ecuador, occupying domestic, peridomestic 
and sylvatic habitats. It is widely distributed in the central coast and southern
highlands regions of Ecuador, two very different regions in terms of
bio-geographical characteristics. To evaluate the genetic relationship among R.
ecuadoriensis populations in these two regions, we analyzed genetic variability
at two microsatellite loci for 326 specimens (n=122 in Manabí and n=204 in Loja) 
and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cyt b) sequences for 174 individuals
collected in the two provinces (n=73 and=101 in Manabí and Loja respectively).
The individual samples were grouped in populations according to their community
of origin. A few populations presented positive FIS, possible due to Wahlund
effect. Significant pairwise differentiation was detected between populations
within each province for both genetic markers, and the isolation by distance
model was significant for these populations. Microsatellite markers showed
significant genetic differentiation between the populations of the two provinces.
The partial sequences of the Cyt b gene (578bp) identified a total of 34
haplotypes among 174 specimens sequenced, which translated into high haplotype
diversity (Hd=0.929). The haplotype distribution differed among provinces
(significant Fisher's exact test). Overall, the genetic differentiation of R.
ecuadoriensis between provinces detected in this study is consistent with the
biological and phenotypic differences previously observed between Manabí and Loja
populations. The current phylogenetic analysis evidenced the monophyly of the
populations of R. ecuadoriensis within the R. pallescens species complex; R.
pallescens and R. colombiensis were more closely related than they were to R.
ecuadoriensis.
