BACKGROUND: Saliva of mosquitoes contains anti-platelet, anti-clotting,
vasodilatory, anti-complement and anti-inflammatory substances that help the
blood feeding process. The salivary polypeptides are at a fast pace of evolution 
possibly due to their relative lack of structural constraint and possibly also by
positive selection on their genes leading to evasion of host immune pressure.
RESULTS: In this study, we used deep mRNA sequence to uncover for the first time 
the sialomes of four Amazonian anophelines species (Anopheles braziliensis, A.
marajorara, A. nuneztovari and A. triannulatus) and extend the knowledge of the
A. darlingi sialome. Two libraries were generated from A. darlingi mosquitoes,
sampled from two localities separated ~ 1100 km apart. A total of 60,016
sequences were submitted to GenBank, which will help discovery of novel
pharmacologically active polypeptides and the design of specific immunological
markers of mosquito exposure. Additionally, in these analyses we identified and
characterized novel phasmaviruses and anpheviruses associated to the sialomes of 
A. triannulatus, A. marajorara and A. darlingi species.
CONCLUSIONS: Besides their pharmacological properties, which may be exploited for
the development of new drugs (e.g. anti-thrombotics), salivary proteins of blood 
feeding arthropods may be turned into tools to prevent and/or better control
vector borne diseases; for example, through the development of vaccines or
biomarkers to evaluate human exposure to vector bites. The sialotranscriptome
study reported here provided novel data on four New World anopheline species and 
allowed to extend our knowledge on the salivary repertoire of A. darlingi.
Additionally, we discovered novel viruses following analysis of the
transcriptomes, a procedure that should become standard within future RNAseq
studies.
