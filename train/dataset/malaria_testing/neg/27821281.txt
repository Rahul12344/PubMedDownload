There are few published reports of mutations in dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps)
and dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) genes in P. falciparum populations in Nigeria,
but one previous study has recorded a novel dhps mutation at codon 431 among
infections imported to the United Kingdom from Nigeria. To assess how widespread 
this mutation is among parasites in different parts of the country and
consequently fill the gap in sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance data in
Nigeria, we retrospectively analysed 1000 filter paper blood spots collected in
surveys of pregnant women and children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria
between 2003 and 2015 from four sites in the south and north. Genomic DNA was
extracted from filter paper blood spots and placental impressions. Point
mutations at codons 16, 50, 51, 59, 108, 140 and 164 of the dhfr gene and codons 
431, 436, 437, 540, 581 and 613 of the dhps gene were evaluated by nested PCR
amplification followed by direct sequencing. The distribution of the dhps-431V
mutation was widespread throughout Nigeria with the highest prevalence in Enugu
(46%). In Ibadan where we had sequential sampling, its prevalence increased from 
0% to 6.5% between 2003 and 2008. Although there were various combinations of
dhps mutations with 431V, the combination 431V + 436A + 437G+581G+613S was the
most common. All these observations support the view that dhps-431V is on the
increase. In addition, P. falciparum DHPS crystal structure modelling shows that 
the change from Isoleucine to Valine (dhps-431V) could alter the effects of both 
S436A/F and A437G, which closely follow the 2nd β-strand. Consequently, it is now
a research priority to assess the implications of dhps-VAGKGS mutant haplotype on
continuing use of SP in seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and intermittent
preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp). Our data also provides surveillance
data for SP resistance markers in Nigeria between 2003 and 2015.
