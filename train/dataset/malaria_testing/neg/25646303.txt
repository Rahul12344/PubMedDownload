The costimulatory molecule CD40 enhances immunity through several distinct roles 
in T cell activation and T cell interaction with other immune cells. In a mouse
model of immunity to liver stage Plasmodium infection, CD40 was critical for the 
full maturation of liver dendritic cells, accumulation of CD8(+) T cells in the
liver, and protective immunity induced by immunization with the Plasmodium yoelii
fabb/f(-) genetically attenuated parasite. Using mixed adoptive transfers of
polyclonal wild-type and CD40-deficient CD8(+) T cells into wild-type and
CD40-deficient hosts, we evaluated the contributions to CD8(+) T cell immunity of
CD40 expressed on host tissues including APC, compared with CD40 expressed on the
CD8(+) T cells themselves. Most of the effects of CD40 could be accounted for by 
expression in the T cells' environment, including the accumulation of large
numbers of CD8(+) T cells in the livers of immunized mice. Thus, protective
immunity generated during immunization with fabb/f(-) was largely dependent on
effective APC licensing via CD40 signaling.
