BACKGROUND: Routine molecular surveillance for imported drug-resistant malaria
parasites to the USA and European Union is an important public health activity.
The obtained molecular data are used to help keep chemoprophylaxis and treatment 
guidelines up to date for persons traveling to malaria endemic countries. Recent 
advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies provide a new and
effective way of tracking malaria drug-resistant parasites.
METHODS: As part of a technology transfer arrangement between the CDC Malaria
Branch and the Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS), Rome, Italy, the recently
described Malaria Resistance Surveillance (MaRS) protocol was used to genotype
148 Plasmodium falciparum isolates from Eritrea for kelch 13 (k13) and cytochrome
b (cytb) genes, molecular markers associated with resistance to artemisinin (ART)
and atovaquone/proguanil (AP), respectively.
RESULTS: Spanning the full-length k13 gene, seven non-synonymous single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found (K189N, K189T, E208K, D281V, E401Q,
R622I and T535M), of which none have been associated with artemisinin resistance.
No mutations were found in cytochrome b.
CONCLUSION: All patients successfully genotyped carried parasites susceptible to 
ART and AP treatment. Future studies between CDC Malaria Branch and ISS are
planned to expand the MaRS system, including data sharing, in an effort to
maintain up to date treatment guidelines for travelers to malaria endemic
countries.
