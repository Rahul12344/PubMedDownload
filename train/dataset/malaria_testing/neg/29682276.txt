Background: microRNAs (miRNAs) are one kind of small non-coding RNAs widely
distributed in insects. Many studies have shown that miRNAs play critical roles
in development, differentiation, apoptosis, and innate immunity. However, there
are a few reports describing miRNAs in Anopheles sinensis, the most common, and
one of the dominant malaria mosquito in China. Here, we investigated the global
miRNA expression profile across four different developmental stages including
embryo, larval, pupal, and adult stages using Illumina Hiseq 2500 sequencing.
Results: In total, 164 miRNAs were obtained out of 107.46 million raw sequencing 
reads. 99 of them identified as known miRNAs, and the remaining 65 miRNAs were
considered as novel. By analyzing the read counts of miRNAs in all developmental 
stages, 95 miRNAs showed stage-specific expression (q < 0.01 and |log2 (fold
change)| > 1) in consecutive stages, indicating that these miRNAs may be involved
in critical physiological activity during development. Sixteen miRNAs were
identified to be commonly dysregulated throughout four developmental stages. Many
miRNAs showed stage-specific expression, such as asi-miR-2943 was exclusively
expressed in the embryo stage, and asi-miR-1891 could not be detected in larval
stage. The expression of six selected differentially expressed miRNAs identified 
by qRT-PCR were consistent with our sequencing results. Furthermore, 5296 and
1902 target genes were identified for the dysregulated 68 known and 27 novel
miRNAs respectively by combining miRanda and RNAhybrid prediction. GO annotation 
and KEGG pathway analysis for the predicted genes of dysregulated miRNAs revealed
that they might be involved in a broad range of biological processes related with
the development, such as membrane, organic substance transport and several key
pathways including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, propanoate
metabolism and folate biosynthesis. Thirty-two key miRNAs were identified by
microRNA-gene network analysis.
Conclusion: The present study represents the first global characterization of An.
sinensis miRNAs in its four developmental stages. The presence and differential
expression of An. sinensis miRNAs imply that such miRNAs may play critical roles 
in An. sinensis life cycle. A better understanding of the functions of these
miRNAs will have great implication for the effective control of vector population
and therefore interrupting malaria transmission.
