BACKGROUND: The control and elimination of Plasmodium vivax will require a better
understanding of its transmission dynamics, through the application of genotyping
and population genetics analyses. This paper describes VivaxGEN
(http://vivaxgen.menzies.edu.au), a web-based platform that has been developed to
support P. vivax short tandem repeat data sharing and comparative analyses.
RESULTS: The VivaxGEN platform provides a repository for raw data generated by
capillary electrophoresis (FSA files), with fragment analysis and standardized
allele calling tools. The query system of the platform enables users to filter,
select and differentiate samples and alleles based on their specified criteria.
Key population genetic analyses are supported including measures of population
differentiation (FST), expected heterozygosity (HE), linkage disequilibrium
(IAS), neighbor-joining analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis. Datasets can 
also be formatted and exported for application in commonly used population
genetic software including GENEPOP, Arlequin and STRUCTURE. To date, data from 10
countries, including 5 publicly available data sets have been shared with
VivaxGEN.
CONCLUSIONS: VivaxGEN is well placed to facilitate regional overviews of P. vivax
transmission dynamics in different endemic settings and capable to be adapted for
similar genetic studies of P. falciparum and other organisms.
