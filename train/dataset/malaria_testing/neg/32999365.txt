A thorough understanding of malaria vector species composition and their bionomic
characteristics is crucial to devise effective and efficient vector control
interventions to reduce malaria transmission. It has been well documented in
Africa that malaria interventions in the past decade have resulted in major
changes in species composition from endophilic Anopheles gambiae to exophilic An.
arabiensis. However, the role of cryptic rare mosquito species in malaria
transmission is not well known. This study examined the species composition and
distribution, with a particular focus on malaria transmission potential of novel,
uncharacterized Anopheles cryptic species in western Kenya. Phylogenetic analysis
based on ITS2 and COX1 genes revealed 21 Anopheles mosquito species, including
two previously unreported novel species. Unusually high rates of Plasmodium
sporozoite infections were detected in An. funestus, An. gambiae and eight
cryptic rare species. Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae and P. ovale sporozoite 
infections were identified with large proportion of mixed species infections in
these vectors. This study, for the first time, reports extensive new Anopheles
cryptic species involved in the malaria transmission in western Kenya. These
findings underscore the importance of non-common Anopheles species in malaria
transmission and the need to target them in routine vector control and
surveillance efforts.
