BACKGROUND: Although cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) improves
survival of unselected patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), only 
a minority responds to therapy and chemoresistance remains a major challenge in
this disease setting.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of oncofetal chondroitin
sulfate (ofCS) glycosaminoglycan chains in cisplatin-resistant MIBC and to
evaluate these as targets for second-line therapy.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An ofCS-binding recombinant VAR2CSA protein
derived from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (rVAR2) was used as an in
situ, in vitro, and in vivo ofCS-targeting reagent in cisplatin-resistant MIBC.
The ofCS expression landscape was analyzed in two independent cohorts of matched 
pre- and post-NAC-treated MIBC patients.
INTERVENTION: An rVAR2 protein armed with cytotoxic hemiasterlin compounds (rVAR2
drug conjugate [VDC] 886) was evaluated as a novel therapeutic strategy in a
xenograft model of cisplatin-resistant MIBC.
OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Antineoplastic effects of
targeting ofCS.
RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In situ, ofCS was significantly overexpressed in
residual tumors after NAC in two independent patient cohorts (p<0.02). Global
gene-expression profiling and biochemical analysis of primary tumors and cell
lines revealed syndican-1 and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 as ofCS-modified
proteoglycans in MIBC. In vitro, ofCS was expressed on all MIBC cell lines
tested, and VDC886 eliminated these cells in the low-nanomolar IC50 concentration
range. In vivo, VDC886 effectively retarded growth of chemoresistant orthotopic
bladder cancer xenografts and prolonged survival (p=0.005). The use of cisplatin 
only for the generation of chemoresistant xenografts are limitations of our
animal model design.
CONCLUSIONS: Targeting ofCS provides a promising second-line treatment strategy
in cisplatin-resistant MIBC.
PATIENT SUMMARY: Cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer overexpresses particular
sugar chains compared with chemotherapy-naïve bladder cancer. Using a recombinant
protein from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we can target these
sugar chains, and our results showed a significant antitumor effect in
cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer. This novel treatment paradigm provides
therapeutic access to bladder cancers not responding to cisplatin.
