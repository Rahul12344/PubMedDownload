[Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum: global status and basic
research].

[Article in Chinese]

Zhao SM, Wang MY.

Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has been identified by WHO in the
Greater Mekong subregion. While there is no report on artemisinin resistance in
Africa and South America by now, related surveillance measures have been taken
place. The genes related artemisinin-resistance has been identified and the
molecular markers will be used for large-scale surveillance efforts to contain
artemisinin resistance. The emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance
worldwide is a present danger and needs more attention. This article reviews the 
progress of artemisininresistance malaria parasites and artemisinin-based
combination therapies.
