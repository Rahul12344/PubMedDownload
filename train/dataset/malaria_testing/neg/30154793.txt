Cerebral malaria is a complex neurological syndrome caused by an infection with
Plasmodium falciparum parasites and is exclusively attributed to a series of
host-parasite interactions at the pathological blood-stage of infection. In
contrast, the preceding intra-hepatic phase of replication is generally
considered clinically silent and thereby excluded from playing any role in the
development of neurological symptoms. In this study, however, we present an
antigen PbmaLS_05 that is presented to the host immune system by both
pre-erythrocytic and intra-erythrocytic stages and contributes to the development
of cerebral malaria in mice. Although deletion of the endogenous PbmaLS_05
prevented the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in susceptible
mice after both sporozoite and infected red blood cell (iRBC) infections, we
observed significant differences in contribution of the host immune response
between both modes of inoculation. Moreover, PbmaLS_05-specific CD8+ T cells
contributed to the development of ECM after sporozoite but not iRBC-infection,
suggesting that pre-erythrocytic antigens like PbmaLS_05 can also contribute to
the development of cerebral symptoms. Our data thus highlight the importance of
the natural route of infection in the study of ECM, with potential implications
for vaccine and therapeutic strategies against malaria.
