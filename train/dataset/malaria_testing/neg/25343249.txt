Chloroquine was a cheap, extremely effective drug against Plasmodium falciparum
until resistance arose. One approach to reversing resistance is the inhibition of
chloroquine efflux from its site of action, the parasite digestive vacuole.
Chloroquine accumulation studies have traditionally relied on radiolabelled
chloroquine, which poses several challenges. There is a need for development of a
safe and biologically relevant substitute. We report here a
commercially-available green fluorescent chloroquine-BODIPY conjugate,
LynxTag-CQGREEN, as a proxy for chloroquine accumulation. This compound localized
to the digestive vacuole of the parasite as observed under confocal microscopy,
and inhibited growth of chloroquine-sensitive strain 3D7 more extensively than in
the resistant strains 7G8 and K1. Microplate reader measurements indicated
suppression of LynxTag-CQGREEN efflux after pretreatment of parasites with known 
reversal agents. Microsomes carrying either sensitive- or resistant-type PfCRT
were assayed for uptake; resistant-type PfCRT exhibited increased accumulation of
LynxTag-CQGREEN, which was suppressed by pretreatment with known
chemosensitizers. Eight laboratory strains and twelve clinical isolates were
sequenced for PfCRT and Pgh1 haplotypes previously reported to contribute to drug
resistance, and pfmdr1 copy number and chloroquine IC50s were determined. These
data were compared with LynxTag-CQGREEN uptake/fluorescence by multiple linear
regression to identify genetic correlates of uptake. Uptake of the compound
correlated with the logIC50 of chloroquine and, more weakly, a mutation in Pgh1, 
F1226Y.
