BACKGROUND: The genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum has been extensively
studied in various countries. However, limited data are available from Ethiopia. 
This study was conducted to evaluate the extent of genetic diversity of P.
falciparum in Kolla-Shele, in the southwest of Ethiopia.
METHODS: A total of 88 isolates from patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum
attending Kolla-Shele Health Centre was collected from September to December,
2008. After extraction of DNA by Chelex method, the samples were genotyped by
using nested-PCR of msp1 (block 2) and msp2 (block 3) including their allelic
families: K1, MAD20, RO33 and FC27, 3D7/IC1, respectively.
RESULTS: Allelic variation in both msp1 and msp2 were identified in the 88 blood 
samples. For msp1 67% (59/88) and msp2 44% (39/88) were observed. K1 was the
predominant msp1 allelic family observed in 33.9% (20/59) of the samples followed
by RO33 and MAD20. Of the msp2 allelic family 3D7/IC1 showed higher frequency
(21.5%) compared to FC27 (10.3%). A total of twenty-three alleles were detected; 
of which, eleven were from msp2 and twelve from msp2 genes. Fifty-nine percent of
isolates had multiple genotypes and the overall mean multiplicity of infection
was 1.8 (95% CI: 1.48-2.04). The heterozygosity index was 0.79 and 0.54for msp1
and msp2, respectively. There was no statically significant difference in the
multiplicity of infection by either age or parasite density (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This genetic diversity study showed the presence of five allelic
types in the study area, with dominance K1 in the msp1 family and 3D7/IC1 in the 
msp2 family. Multiple infections were observed in nearly 60% of the samples.
