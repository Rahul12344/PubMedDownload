Invasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites is mediated by proteins released
from microneme, rhoptry, and dense granule secretory organelles located at the
apical end of parasite invasive forms. Microneme secreted proteins establish
interactions with host cell receptors and induce exocytosis of the rhoptry
organelle. Rhoptry proteins are involved in target cell invasion as well as the
formation of the parasitophorous vacuole in which parasites reside during
development within the host cell. In Plasmodium merozoites, the rhoptry neck
protein (RON) complex consists of RON2, RON4, and RON5, and interacts with apical
membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) as a critical structure of the invasion moving
junction. PfRON12 is known to localize to the rhoptry neck of merozoites, but its
function remains obscure. The roles of RON proteins are largely unknown in
sporozoites, the second invasive form of Plasmodium which possesses a conserved
apical end secretory structure. Here, we confirm that RON12 is expressed in the
rhoptry neck of merozoites in rodent malaria parasites, whereas in contrast we
show that RON12 is localized to the rhoptry body in sporozoites. Phenotypic
analysis of Plasmodium berghei ron12-disrupted mutants revealed that RON12 is
dispensable for sporogony, invasion of mosquito salivary glands and mouse
hepatocytes, and development in hepatocytes.
