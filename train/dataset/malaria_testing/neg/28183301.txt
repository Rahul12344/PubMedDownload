BACKGROUND: Establishing in vitro Plasmodium falciparum culture lines from
patient parasite isolates can offer deeper understanding of geographic variations
of drug sensitivity and mechanisms of malaria pathogenesis and immunity.
Cellulose column filtration of blood is an inexpensive, rapid and effective
method for the removal of host factors, such as leucocytes and platelets,
significantly improving the purification of parasite DNA in a blood sample.
METHODS: In this study, the effect of cellulose column filtration of venous blood
on the initial in vitro growth of P. falciparum parasite isolates from Tanzanian 
children admitted to hospital was tested. The parasites were allowed to expand in
culture without subcultivation until 5 days after admission or the appearance of 
dead parasites and parasitaemia was determined daily. To investigate whether the 
filtration had an effect on clonality, P. falciparum merozoite surface protein 2 
genotyping was performed using nested PCR on extracted genomic DNA, and the var
gene transcript levels were investigated, using quantitative PCR on extracted
RNA, at admission and 4 days of culture.
RESULTS: The cellulose-filtered parasites grew to higher parasitaemia faster than
non-filtered parasites seemingly due to a higher development ratio of ring stage 
parasites progressing into the late stages. Cellulose filtration had no apparent 
effect on clonality or var gene expression; however, evident differences were
observed after only 4 days of culture in both the number of clones and transcript
levels of var genes compared to the time of admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Cellulose column filtration of parasitized blood is a cheap,
applicable method for improving cultivation of P. falciparum field isolates for
ex vivo based assays; however, when assessing phenotype and genotype of cultured 
parasites, in general, assumed to represent the in vivo infection, caution is
advised.
