Background: Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the human immune mechanism play
important role in the detection of invading pathogens. TLRs specifically
recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from pathogens and
start the effective response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLRs 
can mediate their functions. Present study evaluated the importance of rs4986790 
polymorphism of TLR4 gene in susceptibility towards malaria, clinical outcomes of
the disease and responsible species of malaria.
Methods: Blood samples of 228 malaria patients and 226 healthy volunteers were
selected for the study. Sample collection was completed during Sep 2013 to Sep
2015 from different hospitals of Punjab, Pakistan. Patient's samples were divided
into P. vivax group and P. falciparum group on the basis of causative species of 
Plasmodium. Malaria samples were also divided into mild and severe malaria group 
based on clinical outcomes of the disease according to WHO criteria. Healthy
individuals were placed in the control group. Whole blood was used for the
isolation of DNA. Genomic DNA was isolated and amplification of targeted SNP was 
performed using allele-specific PCR.
Results: Results indicate the protective role of AA genotype against the
susceptibility of P. vivax infection, OR: 0.5, 95%CI: 0.285-0.876, P=0.038.
Conclusion: rs4986790 polymorphism of TLR4 gene modulates the susceptibility
towards P. vivax infection. AA genotype is found to be protective against the
development of P. vivax infection in the local population of Pakistan.
