The emergence of artemisinin-resistant parasites since the late 2000s at the
border of Cambodia and Thailand poses serious threats to malaria control
globally, particularly in Africa which bears the highest malaria transmission
burden. This study aimed to obtain reliable data on the current state of the
kelch13 molecular marker for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in
Cameroon. DNA was extracted from the dried blood spots collected from
epidemiologically distinct endemic areas in the Center, Littoral and North
regions of Cameroon. Nested PCR products from the Kelch13-propeller gene were
sequenced and analyzed on an ABI 3730XL automatic sequencer. Of 219 dried blood
spots, 175 were sequenced successfully. We identified six K13 mutations in 2.9%
(5/175) of samples, including 2 non-synonymous, the V589I allele had been
reported in Africa already and one new allele E612K had not been reported yet.
These two non-synonymous mutations were uniquely found in parasites from the
Littoral region. One sample showed two synonymous mutations within the kelch13
gene. We also observed two infected samples with mixed K13 mutant and K13
wild-type infection. Taken together, our data suggested the circulation of the
non-synonymous K13 mutations in Cameroon. Albeit no mutations known to be
associated with parasite clearance delays in the study population, there is need 
for continuous surveillance for earlier detection of resistance as long as ACTs
are used and scaled up in the community.
