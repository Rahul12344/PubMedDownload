BACKGROUND: Nested PCRs based on the Plasmodium 18s-rRNA gene have been
extensively used for human malaria diagnosis. However, they are not practical
when large quantities of samples need to be processed, further there have been
challenges in the performance and when interpreting results, especially when
submicroscopic infections are analysed. Here the use of "direct PCR" was
investigated with the aim of improving diagnosis in the malaria elimination era.
METHODS: The performance of the Plasmodium cytochrome oxidase III gene (COX-III) 
based novel malaria detection strategies (direct nested PCR and direct single
PCR) were compared using a 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR as a reference tool.
Evaluations were based on sensitivity, specificity and the ability to detect
mixed infections using control blood spot samples and field collected blood
samples with final species diagnosis confirmation by sequencing.
RESULTS: The COX-III direct PCR (limit of detection: 0.6-2 parasites/μL) was more
sensitive than the 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR (limit of detection: 2-10
parasites/μL). The COX-III direct PCR identified all 21 positive controls (no
mixed infections detected) while the 18s-rRNA direct nested PCR identified 18/21 
(including four mixed infections). Different concentrations of simulated mixed
infections (Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum) suggest that the COX-III 
direct PCR detects only the predominant species. When the 18s-rRNA direct nested 
PCR was used to detect Plasmodium in field collected bloods spots (n = 3833),
there was discrepancy in the results from the genus PCR (16 % positive) and the
species-specific PCR (5 % positive). Further, a large portion of a subset of
these positive samples (93 % for genus and 60 % for P. vivax), did not align with
Plasmodium sequences. In contrast, the COX-III direct PCR clearly identified
(single bands confirmed with sequencing) 2 % positive Plasmodium samples
including P. vivax, P. falciparum, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium ovale
wallikeri.
CONCLUSIONS: The COX-III single direct PCR is an alternative method for accurate 
detection of Plasmodium microscopic and submicroscopic infections in humans,
especially when a large number of samples require screening. This PCR does not
require DNA isolation, is sensitive, quick, produces confident/clear results,
identifies all the Plasmodium species infecting humans, and is cost-effective.
