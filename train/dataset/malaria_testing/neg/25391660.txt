The Plasmodium falciparum protein translation enzymes aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases 
(aaRSs) are an emergent family of drug targets. The aaRS ensemble catalyses
transfer of amino acids to cognate tRNAs, thus providing charged tRNAs for
ribosomal consumption. P. falciparum proteome expression relies on a total of 36 
aaRSs for the three translationally independent compartments of cytoplasm,
apicoplast and mitochondria. In the present study, we show that, of this set of
36, a single genomic copy of mitochondrial phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (mFRS) is
targeted to the parasite mitochondria, and that the mFRS gene is exclusive to
malaria parasites within the apicomplexan phyla. Our protein cellular
localization studies based on immunofluorescence data show that, along with mFRS,
P. falciparum harbours two more phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (FRS) assemblies
that are localized to its apicoplast and cytoplasm. The 'extra' mFRS is found in 
mitochondria of all asexual blood stage parasites and is competent in
aminoacylation. We show further that the parasite mitochondria import tRNAs from 
the cytoplasmic tRNA pool. Hence drug targeting of FRSs presents a unique
opportunity to potentially stall protein production in all three parasite
translational compartments.
