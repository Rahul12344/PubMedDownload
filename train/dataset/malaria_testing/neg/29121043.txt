Together, malaria and the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) kill more than
800,000 people annually, while creating long-term disability in millions more.
International support for mass drug administration, bed nets, and other
preventive measures has resulted in huge public health gains, while support for
translational research is leading to the development of some new neglected
disease drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines. However, funding for basic science
research has not kept up, such that we are missing opportunities to create a more
innovative pipeline of control tools for parasitic and related diseases. There is
an urgent need to expand basic science approaches for neglected diseases,
especially in the areas of systems biology and immunology; ecology, evolution,
and mathematical biology; functional and comparative OMICs; gene editing;
expanded use of model organisms; and a new single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA
sequencing approach. The world's poor deserve access to innovation for neglected 
diseases. It should be considered a fundamental human right.
