Malaria parasites are characterized by a complex life cycle that is accompanied
by dynamic gene expression patterns. The factors and mechanisms that regulate
gene expression in these parasites have been searched for even before the advent 
of next generation sequencing technologies. Functional genomics approaches have
substantially boosted this area of research and have yielded significant insights
into the interplay between epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional
mechanisms. Recently, considerable progress has been made in identifying
sequence-specific transcription factors and DNA-encoded regulatory elements.
Here, we review the insights obtained from these efforts including the
characterization of core promoters, the involvement of sequence-specific
transcription factors in life cycle progression and the mapping of gene
regulatory elements. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments in the field of 
functional genomics and how they might contribute to further characterization of 
this complex gene regulatory network.
