Despite the clinically proven advantages of intermittent preventive treatment of 
malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), utilisation has 
been low in many African countries. To increase uptake and achieve the desired
effect, the World Health Organization revised the policy to a monthly
administration. Assessing the coverage and impact of the revised policy on
pregnancy and neonatal outcomes is, therefore, a necessity. A 2-parallel
cross-sectional hospital-based study was carried out among pregnant women
attending first antenatal care (ANC) and delivery. Maternal and cord blood
samples were assayed for malaria parasites by quantitative PCR targeting both the
18S rDNA and the acidic terminal segment of Plasmodium falciparum var genes, and 
plasma SP levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry. Parasite prevalence was similar between the two study sites but
decreased significantly between the first ANC (9% or 43%) and delivery (4% or
11%) based on the qPCR target. At delivery, 64.5% of women received ≥3 IPTp-SP
dose, 15.5% received 2 doses and 6% had 1 dose. Taking ≥3 IPTp-SP doses was
associated with an average birth weight increase of more than 0.165 kg. IPTp-SP
uptake was associated with plasma SP level at delivery (OR = 32.3, p ≤ 0.005, 95%
CI (13.3;78.4) for those that reported ≥3 IPTp-SP doses) while the same trend of 
improved birth weight was observed with high plasma SP levels. The new IPTp
policy is well implemented and well utilised by women in the sites considered in 
this study and translates to the improved birth weight observed. This study
confirms the interest and the clinical benefit expected from this policy change.
