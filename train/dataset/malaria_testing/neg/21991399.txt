BACKGROUND: The exacting nutritional requirements and complicated life cycles of 
parasites mean that they are not always amenable to high-throughput drug
screening using automated procedures. Therefore, we have engineered the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae to act as a surrogate for expressing anti-parasitic
targets from a range of biomedically important pathogens, to facilitate the rapid
identification of new therapeutic agents.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using pyrimethamine/dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) as a model parasite drug/drug target system, we explore the potential of
engineered yeast strains (expressing DHFR enzymes from Plasmodium falciparum, P. 
vivax, Homo sapiens, Schistosoma mansoni, Leishmania major, Trypanosoma brucei
and T. cruzi) to exhibit appropriate differential sensitivity to pyrimethamine.
Here, we demonstrate that yeast strains (lacking the major drug efflux pump,
Pdr5p) expressing yeast ((Sc)DFR1), human ((Hs)DHFR), Schistosoma ((Sm)DHFR), and
Trypanosoma ((Tb)DHFR and (Tc)DHFR) DHFRs are insensitive to pyrimethamine
treatment, whereas yeast strains producing Plasmodium ((Pf)DHFR and (Pv)DHFR)
DHFRs are hypersensitive. Reassuringly, yeast strains expressing field-verified, 
drug-resistant mutants of P. falciparum DHFR ((Pf)dhfr(51I,59R,108N)) are
completely insensitive to pyrimethamine, further validating our approach to drug 
screening. We further show the versatility of the approach by replacing yeast
essential genes with other potential drug targets, namely phosphoglycerate
kinases (PGKs) and N-myristoyl transferases (NMTs).
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have generated a number of yeast strains that can be
successfully harnessed for the rapid and selective identification of urgently
needed anti-parasitic agents.
