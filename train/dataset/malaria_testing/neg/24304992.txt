Plasmodium (P.) vivax is the prevalent malarial species accounting for 70% of
malaria cases in Pakistan. However, baseline epidemiological data on P. vivax
population structure and drug resistance are lacking from Pakistan. For
population structure studies, molecular genetic markers, circumsporozoite protein
(csp) and merozoite surface protein-1 (msp-1) are considered useful as these play
an important role in P. vivax survival under immune and environmental pressure.
Furthermore, these genes have also been identified as suitable candidates for
vaccine development. While efforts for effective vaccine are underway,
anti-malarial agents remain the mainstay for control. Evidence of resistance
against commonly used anti-malarial agents, particularly
Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) is threatening to make this form of control
defunct. Therefore, studies on drug resistance are necessary so that
anti-malarial treatment strategies can be structured and implemented accordingly 
by the Malaria Control Program, Pakistan. This review aims to provide information
on genetic markers of P. vivax population structure and drug resistance and
comment on their usefulness in molecular surveillance and control.
