Malaria, caused by protozoan Plasmodium parasites, remains a prevalent infectious
human disease due to the lack of an efficient and safe vaccine. This is directly 
related to the persisting gaps in our understanding of the parasite's
interactions with the infected host, especially during the clinically silent yet 
essential liver stage of Plasmodium development. Previously, we and others showed
that genetically attenuated parasites (GAP) that arrest in the liver induce
sterile immunity, but only upon multiple administrations. Here, we
comprehensively studied hepatic gene and miRNA expression in GAP-injected mice,
and found both a broad activation of IFNγ-associated pathways and a significant
increase of murine microRNA-155 (miR-155), that was especially pronounced in
non-parenchymal cells including liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells).
Remarkably, ectopic upregulation of this miRNA in the liver of mice using robust 
hepatotropic adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) vectors enhanced GAP's protective
capacity substantially. In turn, this AAV8-mediated miR-155 expression permitted 
a reduction of GAP injections needed to achieve complete protection against
infectious parasite challenge from previously three to only one. Our study
highlights a crucial role of mammalian miRNAs in Plasmodium liver infection in
vivo and concurrently implies their great potential as future immune-augmenting
agents in improved vaccination regimes against malaria and other diseases.
