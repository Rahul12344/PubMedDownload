BACKGROUND: Informing and evaluating malaria control efforts relies on knowledge 
of local transmission dynamics. Serological and molecular tools have demonstrated
great sensitivity to quantify transmission intensity in low endemic settings
where the sensitivity of traditional methods is limited. Filter paper blood spots
are commonly used a source of both DNA and antibodies. To enhance the operational
practicability of malaria surveys, a method is presented for combined DNA
extraction and antibody elution.
METHODS: Filter paper blood spots were collected as part of a large
cross-sectional survey in the Kenyan highlands. DNA was extracted using a
saponin/chelex method. The eluate of the first wash during the DNA extraction
process was used for antibody detection and compared with previously validated
antibody elution procedures. Antibody elution efficiency was assessed by total
IgG ELISA for malaria antigens apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and
merozoite-surface protein-1 (MSP-142). The sensitivity of nested 18S rRNA and
cytochrome b PCR assays and the impact of doubling filter paper material for PCR 
sensitivity were determined. The distribution of cell material and antibodies
throughout filter paper blood spots were examined using luminescent and
fluorescent reporter assays.
RESULTS: Antibody levels measured after the combined antibody/DNA extraction
technique were strongly correlated to those measured after standard antibody
elution (p < 0.0001). Antibody levels for both AMA-1 and MSP-142 were generally
slightly lower (11.3-21.4%) but age-seroprevalence patterns were
indistinguishable. The proportion of parasite positive samples ranged from 12.9% 
to 19.2% in the different PCR assays. Despite strong agreement between outcomes
of different PCR assays, none of the assays detected all parasite-positive
individuals. For all assays doubling filter paper material for DNA extraction
increased sensitivity. The concentration of cell and antibody material was not
homogenously distributed throughout blood spots.
CONCLUSION: Combined DNA extraction and antibody elution is an operationally
attractive approach for high throughput assessment of cumulative malaria exposure
and current infection prevalence in endemic settings. Estimates of antibody
prevalence are unaffected by the combined extraction and elution procedure. The
choice of target gene and the amount and source of filter paper material for DNA 
extraction can have a marked impact on PCR sensitivity.
