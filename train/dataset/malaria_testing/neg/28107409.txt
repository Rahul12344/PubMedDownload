Site-2 proteases (S2P) belong to the M50 family of metalloproteases, which
typically perform essential roles by mediating activation of membrane-bound
transcription factors through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP).
Protease-dependent liberation of dormant transcription factors triggers diverse
cellular responses, such as sterol regulation, Notch signalling and the unfolded 
protein response. Plasmodium parasites rely on regulated proteolysis for
controlling essential pathways throughout the life cycle. In this study we
examine the Plasmodium-encoded S2P in a murine malaria model and show that it is 
expressed in all stages of Plasmodium development. Localisation studies by
endogenous gene tagging revealed that in all invasive stages the protein is in
close proximity to the nucleus. Ablation of PbS2P by reverse genetics leads to
reduced growth rates during liver and blood infection and, hence, virulence
attenuation. Strikingly, absence of PbS2P was compatible with parasite life cycle
progression in the mosquito and mammalian hosts under physiological conditions,
suggesting redundant or dispensable roles in vivo.
