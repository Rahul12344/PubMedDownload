Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme deficiency is known to offer
protection against malaria and an increased selection of mutant genes in malaria 
endemic regions is expected. However, anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine can 
cause haemolytic anaemia in persons with G6PD deficiency. We studied the extent
of G6PD deficiency in selected persons attending Teaching Hospitals of
Anuradhapura and Kurunegala, two previously high malaria endemic districts in Sri
Lanka. A total of 2059 filter-paper blood spots collected between November 2013
and June 2014 were analysed for phenotypic G6PD deficiency using the modified
WST-8/1-methoxy PMS method. Each assay was conducted with a set of controls and
the colour development assessed visually as well as with a microplate reader at
OD450-630nm. Overall, 142/1018 (13.95%) and 83/1041 (7.97%) were G6PD deficient
in Anuradhapura and Kurunegala districts respectively. The G6PD prevalence was
significantly greater in Anuradhapura when compared to Kurunegala (P<0.0001).
Surprisingly, females were equally affected as males in each district: 35/313
(11.18%) males and 107/705 (15.18%) females were affected in Anuradhapura (P =
0.089); 25/313 (7.99%) males and 58/728 (7.97%) females were affected in
Kurunegala (P = 0.991). Prevalence was greater among females in Anuradhapura than
in Kurunegala (P<0.05), while no such difference was observed between the males
(P>0.05). Severe deficiency (<10% normal) was seen among 28/1018 (2.75%) in
Anuradhapura (7 males; 21 females) and 17/1041 (1.63%) in Kurunegala (7 males; 10
females). Enzyme activity between 10-30% was observed among 114/1018 (11.20%; 28 
males; 86 females) in Anuradhapura while it was 66/1041 (6.34%; 18 males; 48
females) in Kurunegala. Screening and educational programmes for G6PD deficiency 
are warranted in these high risk areas irrespective of gender for the prevention 
of disease states related to this condition.
