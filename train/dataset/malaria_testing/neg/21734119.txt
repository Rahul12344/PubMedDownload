Plasmodium falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthase
(dhps) genes are reliable molecular markers for antifolate resistance. The P.
falciparum ATPase 6 (pfatp6) gene has been proposed to be a potential marker for 
artemisinin resistance. In our previous clinical study, we showed that
artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is highly effective against uncomplicated
malaria in Yaoundé, Cameroon. In the present study, dhfr, dhps, and pfatp6
mutations in P. falciparum isolates obtained from children treated with
artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine were determined. All 61 isolates had
wild-type Pfatp6 263, 623, and 769 alleles, and 11 (18%) had a single E431K
substitution. Three additional mutations, E643Q, E432K, and E641Q, were detected.
The results did not indicate any warning signal of serious concern (i.e., no
parasites were seen with quintuple dhfr-dhps, DHFR Ile164Leu, or pfatp6
mutations), as confirmed by the high clinical efficacy of
artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Further studies are required to identify a 
molecular marker that reliably predicts artemisinin resistance.
