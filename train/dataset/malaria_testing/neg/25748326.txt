Plasmodium vivax infections often recur due to relapse of hypnozoites from the
liver. In malaria-endemic areas, tools to distinguish relapse from reinfection
are needed. We applied amplicon deep sequencing to P. vivax isolates from 78
Cambodian volunteers, nearly one-third of whom suffered recurrence at a median of
68 days. Deep sequencing at a highly variable region of the P. vivax merozoite
surface protein 1 gene revealed impressive diversity-generating 67 unique
haplotypes and detecting on average 3.6 cocirculating parasite clones within
individuals, compared to 2.1 clones detected by a combination of 3 microsatellite
markers. This diversity enabled a scheme to classify over half of recurrences as 
probable relapses based on the low probability of reinfection by multiple
recurring variants. In areas of high P. vivax diversity, targeted deep sequencing
can help detect genetic signatures of relapse, key to evaluating antivivax
interventions and achieving a better understanding of relapse-reinfection
epidemiology.
