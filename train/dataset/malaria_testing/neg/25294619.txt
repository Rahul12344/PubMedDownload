A woman who recently traveled to Thailand came to a local emergency department
with a fever and papular rash. She was tested for measles, malaria, and dengue.
Positive finding for IgM antibody against dengue and a failure to seroconvert for
IgG against dengue for multiple blood samples suggested an alternate flavivirus
etiology. Amplification of a conserved region of the non-structural protein 5
gene of the genus Flavivirus yielded a polymerase chain reaction product with a
matching sequence of 99% identity with Zika virus. A urine sample and a
nasopharygeal swab specimen obtained for the measles investigation were also
positive for this virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.
Subsequently, the urine sample yielded a Zika virus isolate in cell culture. This
case report describes a number of novel clinical and laboratory findings, the
first documentation of this virus in Canada, and the second documentation from
this region in Thailand.
