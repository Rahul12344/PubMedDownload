BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum deficient for hrp2 and hrp3 genes are a threat 
to malaria management and elimination, since they escape widely used HRP2-based
rapid diagnostic tests and treatment. Hrp2/hrp3 deletions are increasingly
reported from all malaria endemic regions but are currently only identified by
laborious methodologies.
METHODS: We developed a novel hydrolysis probe-based, quantitative, real-time PCR
(4plex qPCR) for detection and discrimination of P. falciparum infection (cytb)
and hrp2 and hrp3 gene status, and to control assay validity (btub). A
cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study was performed in Gabon for assay
validation and deletion screening.
FINDINGS: In parallel to identification of P. falciparum infection in samples
down to 0.05 parasites/µl, the 4plex qPCR enabled specific and valid
interrogation of the parasites´s hrp2 and hrp3 genes in one go - even in low
parasitemic samples. The assay was precise and robust also when performed in a
routine healthcare setting in Gabon. The risk of falsely identifying hrp2 or hrp3
deletion was reduced by 100-fold compared to conventional PCR. Evaluation against
microscopy was performed on 200 blood samples collected in Gabon: sensitivity and
specificity of 4plex qPCR (cytb) were 100% and 80%, respectively. Stringent
testing revealed hrp2 deletion in 2 of 95 P. falciparum positive and validated
samples.
INTERPRETATION: The novel 4plex qPCR is sensitive, accurate and allows
resource-efficient rapid screening. Monitoring and mapping of hrp2/hrp3 deletions
is required to identify areas where control strategies may need to be adapted to 
ensure appropriate patient care and ultimately achieve malaria elimination.
