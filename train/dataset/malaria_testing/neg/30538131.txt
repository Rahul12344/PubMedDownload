Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that causes disseminated
infections that can produce neurological damage in fetuses and immunocompromised 
individuals. Microneme protein 2 (MIC2), a member of the thrombospondin-related
anonymous protein (TRAP) family, is a secreted protein important for T. gondii
motility, host cell attachment, invasion, and egress. MIC2 contains six
thrombospondin type I repeats (TSRs) that are modified by C-mannose and O-fucose 
in Plasmodium spp. and mammals. Here, using MS analysis, we found that the four
TSRs in T. gondii MIC2 with protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) acceptor
sites are modified by a dHexHex disaccharide, whereas Trp residues within three
TSRs are also modified with C-mannose. Disruption of genes encoding either POFUT2
or the putative GDP-fucose transporter (NST2) resulted in loss of MIC2
O-fucosylation, as detected by an antibody against the GlcFuc disaccharide, and
in markedly reduced cellular levels of MIC2. Furthermore, in 10-15% of the
Δpofut2 or Δnst2 vacuoles, MIC2 accumulated earlier in the secretory pathway
rather than localizing to micronemes. Dissemination of tachyzoites in human
foreskin fibroblasts was reduced for these knockouts, which both exhibited
defects in attachment to and invasion of host cells comparable with the Δmic2
phenotype. These results, indicating that O-fucosylation of TSRs is required for 
efficient processing of MIC2 and for normal parasite invasion, are consistent
with the recent demonstration that Plasmodium falciparum Δpofut2 strain has
decreased virulence and also support a conserved role for this glycosylation
pathway in quality control of TSR-containing proteins in eukaryotes.
