BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem, and its control has
been hampered by drug resistance. For a number of drugs, Plasmodium falciparum
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with altered drug
sensitivity and can be used as markers of drug resistance. Several techniques
have been studied to assess resistance markers. The most widely used methodology 
is restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The ligase detection
reaction fluorescent microsphere (LDR-FM) assay was recently shown to provide
high throughput assessment of P. falciparum SNPs associated with drug resistance.
The aim of this study was to validate the reliability and accuracy of the LDR-FM 
assay in a field setting.
METHODS: For 223 samples from a clinical trial in Tororo, Uganda in which P.
falciparum was identified by blood smear, DNA was extracted from dried blood
spots, genes of interest were amplified by PCR, amplicons were analysed by both
RFLP and LDR-FM assays, and results were compared.
RESULTS: SNP prevalence (wild type/mixed/mutant) with RFLP analysis was 8/5/87%
for pfcrt K76T, 34/37/29% for pfmdr1 N86Y, 64/17/19% for pfmdr1 Y184F, and
42/21/37% for pfmdr1 D1246Y. These prevalences with the LDR-FM assay were
7/5/88%, 31/24/45%, 62/20/18%, and 48/19/33% for the four SNPs, respectively.
Combining mixed and mutant outcomes for analysis, agreement between the assays
was 97% (K=0.77) for pfcrt K76T, 79% (K=0.55) for pfmdr1 N86Y, 83% (K=0.65) for
pfmdr1 Y184F, and 91% (K=0.82) for pfmdr1 D1246Y, with most disagreements due to 
discrepant readings of mixed genotypes.
CONCLUSION: The LDR-FM assay provides a high throughput, relatively inexpensive
and accurate assay for the surveillance of P. falciparum SNPs associated with
drug resistance in resource-limited countries.
