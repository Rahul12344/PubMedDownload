TPI1 promoter polymorphisms occur in high prevalence in individuals from African 
origin. Malaria-patients from Angola and Mozambique were screened for the TPI1
gene promoter variants rs1800200A>G, (-5G>A), rs1800201G>A, (-8G>A),
rs1800202T>G, (-24T>G), and for the intron 5 polymorphism rs2071069G>A,
(2262G>A). -5G>A and -8G>A variants occur in 47% and 53% in Angola and
Mozambique, respectively while -24T>G was monomorphic for the wild-type T allele.
Six haplotypes were identified and -8A occurred in 45% of the individuals,
especially associated with the GAG haplotype and more frequent in non-severe
malaria groups, although not significantly. The arising and dispersion of -5G>A
and -8G>A polymorphisms is controversial. Their age was estimated by analyses of 
two microsatellite loci, CD4 and ATN1, adjacent to TPI1 gene. The -5G>A is older 
than -8G>A, with an average estimate of approximately 35,000 years. The -8A
variant arose in two different backgrounds, suggesting independent mutational
events. The first, on the -5G background, may have occurred in East Africa around
20,800 years ago; the second, on the -5A background, may have occurred in West
Africa some 7500 years ago. These estimates are within the period of spread of
agriculture and the malaria mosquito vector in Africa, which could has been a
possible reason for the selection of -8A polymorphism in malaria endemic
countries.
