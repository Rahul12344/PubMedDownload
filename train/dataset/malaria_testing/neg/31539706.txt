Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax co-exist at different endemicity levels across
Ethiopia. For over two decades Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) is the first line
treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum, while chloroquine (CQ) is still used
to treat P. vivax. It is currently unclear whether a shift from CQ to AL for P.
falciparum treatment has implications for AL efficacy and results in a reversal
of mutations in genes associated to CQ resistance, given the high co-endemicity
of the two species and the continued availability of CQ for the treatment of P.
vivax. This study thus assessed the prevalence of Pfcrt-K76T and Pfmdr1-N86Y
point mutations in P. falciparum. 18S RNA gene based nested PCR confirmed P.
falciparum samples (N = 183) collected through community and health facility
targeted cross-sectional surveys from settings with varying P. vivax and P.
falciparum endemicity were used. The proportion of Plasmodium infections that
were P. vivax was 62.2% in Adama, 41.4% in Babile, 30.0% in Benishangul-Gumuz to 
6.9% in Gambella. The Pfcrt-76T mutant haplotype was observed more from samples
with higher endemicity of P. vivax as being 98.4% (61/62), 100% (31/31), 65.2%
(15/23) and 41.5% (22/53) in samples from Adama, Babile, Benishangul-Gumuz and
Gambella, respectively. However, a relatively higher proportion of Pfmdr1-N86
allele (77.3-100%) were maintained in all sites. The observed high level of the
mutant Pfcrt-76T allele in P. vivax co-endemic sites might require that
utilization of CQ needs to be re-evaluated in settings co-endemic for the two
species. A country-wide assessment is recommended to clarify the implication of
the observed level of variation in drug resistance markers on the efficacy of
AL-based treatment against uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
