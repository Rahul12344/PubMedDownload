Neuronal Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 4 (Npas4) is a key protein that
intervenes in GABA synapse scaling and neurotrophicity enhancing. Since GABA and 
neurotrophicity are implicated in stress response and Npas4-deficient rodents
exhibit behavioral alterations, an investigation was designed in rats to verify
whether stress-induced spontaneous hippocampus Npas4 mRNA expression would be
associated with specific patterns of stress response. The rats were exposed to
one of three stressor levels: no stress (CTL, n = 15), exposure to a footshock
apparatus (Sham, S, n = 40) and footshock (F, n = 80). After stress exposure the 
S and F rats were tested in an activity cage, and subsequently in an elevated
plus maze (EPM), just prior to the sacrifice. Using cluster analysis, the animals
already assigned to a stress level were also distributed into 2 subgroups
depending on their Npas4 mRNA levels. The low (L) and high (H) Npas4 expression
subgroups were identified in the S and F groups, the CTL group being independent 
of the Npas4 levels. The Npas4 effect was studied through the interaction between
stress (S and F) and Npas4 level (L and H). The biological stress response was
similar in H and L rats, except blood corticosterone that was slightly lower in
the H rats. The H rats were more active in the actimetry cage and presented
higher levels of exploration in the EPM. They also exhibited higher hippocampus
activation, as assessed by the c-fos, Egr1 and Arc mRNA levels. Therefore high
Npas4 expression favors stress management.
