Apicomplexa form a phylum of obligate parasitic protozoa of great clinical and
veterinary importance. These parasites synthesize glycoconjugates for their
survival and infectivity, but the enzymatic steps required to generate the
glycosylation precursors are not completely characterized. In particular,
glucosamine-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) activity, needed to produce the 
essential UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) donor, has not been identified in 
any Apicomplexa. We scanned the genomes of Plasmodium falciparum and
representatives from six additional main lineages of the phylum for proteins
containing the Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain. One family of
GNAT-domain containing proteins, composed by a P. falciparum sequence and its six
apicomplexan orthologs, rescued the growth of a yeast temperature-sensitive GNA1 
mutant. Heterologous expression and in vitro assays confirmed the GNA1 enzymatic 
activity in all lineages. Sequence, phylogenetic and synteny analyses suggest an 
independent origin of the Apicomplexa-specific GNA1 family, parallel to the
evolution of a different GNA1 family in other eukaryotes. The inability to
disrupt an otherwise modifiable gene target suggests that the enzyme is essential
for P. falciparum growth. The relevance of UDP-GlcNAc for parasite viability,
together with the independent evolution and unique sequence features of
Apicomplexa GNA1, highlights the potential of this enzyme as a selective
therapeutic target against apicomplexans.
