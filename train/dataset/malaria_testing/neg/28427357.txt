BACKGROUND: Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
pediatric severe malarial anemia (SMA) pathogenesis is a crucial step in the
design of novel therapeutics. Identification of host genetic susceptibility
factors in immune regulatory genes offers an important tool for deciphering
malaria pathogenesis. The IL-23/IL-17 immune pathway is important for both
immunity and erythropoiesis via its effects through IL-23 receptors (IL-23R).
However, the impact of IL-23R variants on SMA has not been fully elucidated.
METHODS: Since variation within the coding region of IL-23R may influence the
pathogenesis of SMA, the association between IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T), rs7530511
(C/T), and SMA (Hb < 6.0 g/dL) was examined in children (n = 369, aged
6-36 months) with P. falciparum malaria in a holoendemic P. falciparum
transmission area.
RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis, controlling for confounding factor of
anemia, revealed that individual genotypes of IL-23R rs1884444 (G/T) [GT;
OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.78-2.31, P = 0.304 and TT; OR = 2.02, 95% CI = 0.53-7.74,
P = 0.286] and IL-23R rs7530511 (C/T) [CT; OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 0.59-11.86,
P = 0.202 and TT; OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 0.84-3.27, P = 0.142] were not associated
with susceptibility to SMA. However, carriage of IL-23R rs1884444T/rs7530511T
(TT) haplotype, consisting of both mutant alleles, was associated with increased 
susceptibility to SMA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-4.19, P = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Results presented here demonstrate that a haplotype of non-synonymous
IL-23R variants increase susceptibility to SMA in children of a holoendemic P.
falciparum transmission area.
