Studies of Plasmodium vivax gene expression are complicated by the lack of in
vitro culture system and the difficulties associated with studying clinical
infections that often contain multiple clones and a mixture of parasite stages.
Here, we characterize the transcriptomes of P. vivax parasites from 26 malaria
patients. We show that most parasite mRNAs derive from trophozoites and that the 
asynchronicity of P. vivax infections is therefore unlikely to confound gene
expression studies. Analyses of gametocyte genes reveal two distinct clusters of 
co-regulated genes, suggesting that male and female gametocytes are independently
regulated. Finally, we analyze gene expression changes induced by chloroquine and
show that this antimalarial drug efficiently eliminates most P. vivax parasite
stages but, in contrast to P. falciparum, does not affect trophozoites.
