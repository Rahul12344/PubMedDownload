The alveolates comprise three well-studied protist lineages of significant
environmental, medical, and economical importance: apicomplexans (e.g.,
Plasmodium), dinoflagellates (e.g., Symbiodinium), and ciliates (e.g.,
Tetrahymena). These major lineages have evolved distinct and unusual
characteristics, the origins of which have proved to be difficult evolutionary
puzzles. Mitochondrial genomes are a prime example: all three groups depart from 
canonical form and content, but in different ways. Reconstructing such ancient
transitions is difficult without deep-branching lineages that retain ancestral
characteristics. Here we describe two such lineages and how they illuminate the
ancestral state of alveolate mitochondrial genomes. We established five clonal
cultures of colponemids, predatory alveolates without cultured representatives
and molecular data. Colponemids represent at least two independent lineages at
the phylum level in multilocus phylogenetic analysis; one sister to apicomplexans
and dinoflagellates, and the other at a deeper position. A genome survey from one
strain showed that ancestral state of the mitochondrial genomes in the three
major alveolate lineages consisted of an unusual linear chromosome with telomeres
and a substantially larger gene set than known alveolates. Colponemid sequences
also identified several environmental lineages as colponemids, altogether
suggesting an untapped potential for understanding the origin and evolution of
apicomplexans, dinoflagellates, and ciliates.
