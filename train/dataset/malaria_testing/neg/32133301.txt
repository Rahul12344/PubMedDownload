Ticks are hematophagous arthropods that transmit a number of pathogens while
feeding. Among these is tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a flavivirus
transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks in the temperate zone of Europe. The
infection results in febrile illness progressing to encephalitis and meningitis
with a possibility of fatality or long-term neurological sequelae. The
composition of tick saliva plays an essential role in the initial virus
transmission during tick feeding. Ticks secrete a diverse range of salivary
proteins to modulate the host response, such as lipocalins to control the itch
and inflammatory response, and both proteases and protease inhibitors to prevent 
blood coagulation. Here, the effect of viral infection of adult females of Ixodes
ricinus was studied with the goal of determining how the virus alters the tick
sialome to modulate host tissue response at the site of infection. Uninfected
ticks or those infected with TBEV were fed on mice and removed and dissected one-
and 3-h post-attachment. RNA from the salivary glands of these ticks, as well as 
from unfed ticks, was extracted and subjected to next-generation sequencing to
determine the expression of key secreted proteins at each timepoint. Genes
showing statistically significant up- or down-regulation between infected and
control ticks were selected and compared to published literature to ascertain
their function. From this, the effect of tick viral infection on the modulation
of the tick-host interface was determined. Infected ticks were found to
differentially express a number of uncategorized genes, proteases, Kunitz-type
serine protease inhibitors, cytotoxins, and lipocalins at different timepoints.
These virus-induced changes to the tick sialome may play a significant role in
facilitating virus transmission during the early stages of tick feeding.
