Non-human primates belonging to the Aotus genus have been shown to be excellent
experimental models for evaluating drugs and vaccine candidates against malaria
and other human diseases. The immune system of this animal model must be
characterised to assess whether the results obtained here can be extrapolated to 
humans. Class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are
amongst the most important molecules involved in response to pathogens; in spite 
of this, the techniques available for genotyping these molecules are usually
expensive and/or time-consuming. Previous studies have reported MHC-DRB class II 
gene typing by microsatellite in Old World primates and humans, showing that such
technique provides a fast, reliable and effective alternative to the commonly
used ones. Based on this information, a microsatellite present in MHC-DRB intron 
2 and its evolutionary patterns were identified in two Aotus species (A.
vociferans and A. nancymaae), as well as its potential for genotyping class II
MHC-DRB in these primates.
