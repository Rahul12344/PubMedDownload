Complement receptor 1 (CR1) levels have been associated with malarial
susceptibility and/or severity of the disease in different population groups, and
CR1 is a receptor for Plasmodium falciparum. In this study, multiple CR1
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showed strong evidence of population
differentiation between Sardinian and other European ethnic groups. Cross
population algorithms comparing haplotype structure and differences in haplotype 
and allele frequency distribution provided additional support for natural
selection of CR1 in Sardinia. The predominant Sardinian CR1 haplotype included
SNPs that are associated with decreased CR1 levels in Europeans and other
population groups. Previous studies have shown that the SNPs within the dominant 
Sardinian haplotype have a significantly higher frequency in a malaria endemic
compared with non-endemic regions in India. Together with the historical evidence
of the prevalence of malaria in Sardinia, these data support the role of malaria 
leading to positive selection of this CR1 haplotype in Sardinia.
