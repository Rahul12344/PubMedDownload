Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine
(IPTp-SP) is one of the main strategies for protecting pregnant women, fetus, and
their new-born against adverse effects of P. falciparum infection. The
development of the drug resistance linked to mutations in P. falciparum
dihydrofolate reductase gene (pfdhfr) and P. falciparum dihydropteroate synthase 
gene (pfdhps), is currently threatening the IPTp-SP approach. This study
determined the prevalence of pfdhfr and pfdhps mutations in isolates obtained
from pregnant women with asymptomatic P. falciparum infection in Nigerian.
Additionally, P. falciparum genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection (MOI)
was assessed by genotyping the P. falciparum merozoite surface Protein 1 and 2
(pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2) genes. The pfdhfr and pfdhps were genotyped by direct
sequencing, and the pfmsp-1 and pfmsp-2 fragment analysis by polymerase chain
reaction was used to determine P. falciparum genetic diversity. Of the 406
pregnant women recruited, 123 had P. falciparum infection by PCR, and of these,
52 were successfully genotyped for pfdhfr and 42 for pfdhps genes. The pfdhfr
triple-mutant parasites (N51I, C59R, and S108N) or the IRN haplotype were
predominant (98%), whereas pfdhfr mutations C50R and I164L did not occur. For
pfdhps gene, the prevalence of A437G, A581G, A436A, and A613S mutations were 98, 
71, 55, and 36%, respectively. Nineteen (44%) isolates with quintuple mutations
(CIRNI- SGKGA) had the highest combined pfdhfr-pfdhps haplotype. Isolates with
sextuple mutants; CIRNI- AGKAS and CIRNI- AGKGA had a prevalence of 29 and 14%,
respectively. High genetic diversity (7 pfmsp-1 alleles and 10 pfmsp-2 alleles)
and monoclonal infection rate (76%) was observed. This study demonstrated a
continuous high prevalence of pfdhfr mutation and an increase in pfdhps mutations
associated with SP-resistance in southwest Nigeria. Continuous surveillance of
IPTp-SP effectiveness and consideration of alternative IPTp strategies is
recommended.
