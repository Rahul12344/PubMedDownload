flow.

The primary Afrotropical malaria mosquito vector Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto 
has a complex population structure. In west Africa, this species is split into
two molecular forms and displays local and regional variation in chromosomal
arrangements and behaviors. To investigate patterns of macrogeographic population
substructure, 25 An. gambiae samples from 12 African countries were genotyped at 
13 microsatellite loci. This analysis detected the presence of additional
population structuring, with the M-form being subdivided into distinct west,
central, and southern African genetic clusters. These clusters are coincident
with the central African rainforest belt and northern and southern savannah
biomes, which suggests restrictions to gene flow associated with the transition
between these biomes. By contrast, geographically patterned population
substructure appears much weaker within the S-form.
