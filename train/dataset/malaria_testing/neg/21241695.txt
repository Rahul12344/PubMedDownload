The origin of new genes is critical for organisms adapting to new niches. Here,
we present evidence for a recent de novo origin of at least 13 protein-coding
genes in the genome of Plasmodium vivax. Although recently de novo originated
genes have often been suggested to be initially intronless, five of the genes
identified in our analysis contain introns in their coding regions. Further
investigations revealed that these introns likely evolved from previously
intergenic regions together with the coding sequences. We discuss the potential
mechanisms for intron formation in these genes and propose that intronization be 
considered in the formation of de novo originated genes.
