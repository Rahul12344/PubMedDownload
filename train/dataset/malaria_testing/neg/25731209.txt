Placental malaria (PM) causes significant morbidity in mothers and infants.
Diagnosis of PM during pregnancy is however problematic due to placental
sequestration of parasites. Host biomarkers may therefore be used as a diagnostic
method. In this systematic review most studies focused on inflammatory markers. A
trend was observed for increased IL-10 and TNF-Î± in PM positives. These markers
are however unspecific, thus a combination of multiple biomarkers involved in
different pathophysiological pathways of PM is indicated. Of interest are
inflammatory markers (TNF-R2, CXCL-13), markers of lipid metabolism (APO-B),
angiogenesis (sFlt-1) and hormones (estradiol). As the majority of published
studies tested biomarker levels only at delivery, more longitudinal cohort
studies will be necessary to detect biomarkers during pregnancy that can predict 
PM.
