The continuous spread of antimalarial drug resistance is a threat to current
chemotherapy efficacy. Therefore, characterizing the genetic diversity of drug
resistance markers is needed to follow treatment effectiveness and further update
control strategies. Here, we genotyped Plasmodium falciparum resistance gene
markers associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and artemisinin-based
combination therapy (ACT) in isolates from pregnant women in Ghana. The
prevalence of the septuple IRN I- A/FG K GS/T pfdhfr/pfdhps haplotypes, including
the pfdhps A581G and A613S/T mutations, was high at delivery among post-SP
treatment isolates (18.2%) compared to those of first antenatal care (before
initiation of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine [IPTp-SP]; 6.1%; P = 0.03). Regarding the pfk13 marker 
gene, two nonsynonymous mutations (N458D and A481C) were detected at positions
previously related to artemisinin resistance in isolates from Southeast Asia.
These mutations were predicted in silico to alter the stability of the pfk13
propeller-encoding domain. Overall, these findings highlight the need for
intensified monitoring and surveillance of additional mutations associated with
increased SP resistance as well as emergence of resistance against artemisinin
derivatives.
