CD4+ T cell functional inhibition (exhaustion) is a hallmark of malaria and
correlates with impaired parasite control and infection chronicity. However, the 
mechanisms of CD4+ T cell exhaustion are still poorly understood. In this study, 
we show that Ag-experienced (Ag-exp) CD4+ T cell exhaustion during Plasmodium
yoelii nonlethal infection occurs alongside the reduction in mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) activity and restriction in CD4+ T cell glycolytic capacity. We 
demonstrate that the loss of glycolytic metabolism and mTOR activity within the
exhausted Ag-expCD4+ T cell population during infection coincides with reduction 
in T-bet expression. T-bet was found to directly bind to and control the
transcription of various mTOR and metabolism-related genes within effector CD4+ T
cells. Consistent with this, Ag-expTh1 cells exhibited significantly higher and
sustained mTOR activity than effector T-bet- (non-Th1) Ag-expT cells throughout
the course of malaria. We identified mTOR to be redundant for sustaining T-bet
expression in activated Th1 cells, whereas mTOR was necessary but not sufficient 
for maintaining IFN-γ production by Th1 cells. Immunotherapy targeting PD-1,
CTLA-4, and IL-27 blocked CD4+ T cell exhaustion during malaria infection and was
associated with elevated T-bet expression and a concomitant increased CD4+ T cell
glycolytic metabolism. Collectively, our data suggest that mTOR activity is
linked to T-bet in Ag-expCD4+ T cells but that reduction in mTOR activity may not
directly underpin Ag-expTh1 cell loss and exhaustion during malaria infection.
These data have implications for therapeutic reactivation of exhausted CD4+ T
cells during malaria infection and other chronic conditions.
