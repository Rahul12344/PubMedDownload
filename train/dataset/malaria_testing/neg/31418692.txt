Apicomplexan-like parasites are polyphyletic and widely but selectively dependent
on cryptic plastid organelles.

The phylum Apicomplexa comprises human pathogens such as Plasmodium but is also
an under-explored hotspot of evolutionary diversity central to understanding the 
origins of parasitism and non-photosynthetic plastids. We generated single-cell
transcriptomes for all major apicomplexan groups lacking large-scale sequence
data. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that apicomplexan-like parasites are
polyphyletic and their similar morphologies emerged convergently at least three
times. Gregarines and eugregarines are monophyletic, against most expectations,
and rhytidocystids and Eleutheroschizon are sister lineages to medically
important taxa. Although previously unrecognized, plastids in deep-branching
apicomplexans are common, and they contain some of the most divergent and AT-rich
genomes ever found. In eugregarines, however, plastids are either abnormally
reduced or absent, thus increasing known plastid losses in eukaryotes from two to
four. Environmental sequences of ten novel plastid lineages and structural
innovations in plastid proteins confirm that plastids in apicomplexans and their 
relatives are widespread and share a common, photosynthetic origin.
