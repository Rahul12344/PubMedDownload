Molecular surveillance of the drug resistance genes in parasite can be used for
monitoring/surveillance of drug resistance in endemic malaria areas. Here we
report the prevalence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in dihydrofolate 
reductase (dhfr) gene in nucleotide sequence of Plasmodium falciparum from
different regions in India. We found markedly prevalent mutants evident in P.
falciparum infections N51I, C59R, 108N and I164L. Our results indicate that P.
falciparum populations in the regions show an increase in the prevalence of
polymorphisms, most likely reflecting different selective pressures found in
humans and mosquitoes. Molecular surveillance can serve as a useful tool to
monitor the prevalence/emergence of resistant genotypes within endemic
populations and can serve for determining the efficacy of antimalarial drugs.
