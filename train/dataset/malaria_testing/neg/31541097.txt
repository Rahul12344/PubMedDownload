Mainstay treatment for Plasmodium vivax malaria has long relied on chloroquine
(CQ) against blood-stage parasites plus primaquine against dormant liver-stage
forms (hypnozoites), however drug resistance confronts this regimen and threatens
malaria control programs. Understanding the basis of P. vivax chloroquine
resistance (CQR) will inform drug discovery and malaria control. Here we
investigate the genetics of P. vivax CQR by a cross of parasites differing in
drug response. Gametocytogenesis, mosquito infection, and progeny production are 
performed with mixed parasite populations in nonhuman primates, as methods for P.
vivax cloning and in vitro cultivation remain unavailable. Linkage mapping of
progeny surviving >15 mg/kg CQ identifies a 76 kb region in chromosome 1
including pvcrt, an ortholog of the Plasmodium falciparum CQR transporter gene.
Transcriptional analysis supports upregulated pvcrt expression as a mechanism of 
CQR.
