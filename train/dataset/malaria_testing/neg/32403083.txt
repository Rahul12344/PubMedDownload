BACKGROUND: Many health facilities in malaria endemic countries are dependent on 
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for diagnosis and some National Health Service
(NHS) hospitals without expert microscopists rely on them for diagnosis out of
hours. The emergence of P. falciparum lacking the gene encoding histidine-rich
protein 2 and 3 (HRP2 and HRP3) and escaping RDT detection threatens progress in 
malaria control and elimination. Currently, confirmation of RDT negative due to
the deletion of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3, which encodes a cross-reactive protein
isoform, requires a series of PCR assays. These tests have different limits of
detection and many laboratories have reported difficulty in confirming the
absence of the deletions with certainty.
METHODS: We developed and validated a novel and rapid multiplex real time
quantitative (qPCR) assay to detect pfhrp2, pfhrp3, confirmatory parasite and
human reference genes simultaneously. We also applied the assay to detect pfhrp2 
and pfhrp3 deletion in 462 field samples from different endemic countries and UK 
travellers.
RESULTS: The qPCR assay demonstrated diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (n = 19, 95% 
CI= (82.3%; 100%)) and diagnostic specificity of 100% (n = 31; 95% CI= (88.8%;
100%)) in detecting pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions. In addition, the assay estimates
P. falciparum parasite density and accurately detects pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions
masked in polyclonal infections. We report pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 deletions in
parasite isolates from Kenya, Tanzania and in UK travellers.
INTERPRETATION: The new qPCR is easily scalable to routine surveillance studies
in countries where P. falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 are a threat
to malaria control.
