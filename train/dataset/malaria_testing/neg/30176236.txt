Babesia microti and Babesia duncani are the main causative agents of human
babesiosis in the United States. While significant knowledge about B. microti has
been gained over the past few years, nothing is known about B. duncani biology,
pathogenesis, mode of transmission or sensitivity to currently recommended
therapies. Studies in immunocompetent wild type mice and hamsters have shown that
unlike B. microti, infection with B. duncani results in severe pathology and
ultimately death. The parasite factors involved in B. duncani virulence remain
unknown. Here we report the first known completed sequence and annotation of the 
apicoplast and mitochondrial genomes of B. duncani. We found that the apicoplast 
genome of this parasite consists of a 34 kb monocistronic circular molecule
encoding functions that are important for apicoplast gene transcription as well
as translation and maturation of the organelle's proteins. The mitochondrial
genome of B. duncani consists of a 5.9 kb monocistronic linear molecule with two 
inverted repeats of 48 bp at both ends. Using the conserved cytochrome b (Cytb)
and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (coxI) proteins encoded by the mitochondrial
genome, phylogenetic analysis revealed that B. duncani defines a new lineage
among apicomplexan parasites distinct from B. microti, Babesia bovis, Theileria
spp. and Plasmodium spp. Annotation of the apicoplast and mitochondrial genomes
of B. duncani identified targets for development of effective therapies. Our
studies set the stage for evaluation of the efficacy of these drugs alone or in
combination against B. duncani in culture as well as in animal models.
