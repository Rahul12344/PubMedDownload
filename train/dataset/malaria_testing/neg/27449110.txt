BACKGROUND: Anti-malarial drugs are the major focus in the prevention and
treatment of malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the WHO
recommended first-line treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria across the
endemic world. Also ACT is increasingly relied upon in treating Plasmodium vivax 
malaria where chloroquine is failing. The emergence of artemisinin drug-resistant
parasites is a serious threat faced by global malaria control programmes.
Therefore, the success of treatment and intervention strategies is highly pegged 
on understanding the genetic basis of resistance.
METHODS: Here, resistance in P. falciparum was generated in vitro for artemisinin
to produce levels above clinically relevant concentrations in vivo, and the
molecular haplotypes investigated. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp
mini DNA kit. DNA sequences of Pfk13, Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes were amplified by
PCR and the amplicons were successfully sequenced. Single nucleotide
polymorphisms were traced by standard bidirectional sequencing and reading the
transcripts against wild-type sequences in Codon code Aligner Version 5.1 and
NCBI blast.
RESULTS: Exposure of parasite strains D6 and W2 to artemisinin resulted in a
decrease in parasite susceptibility to artemisinin (W2 and D6) and lumefantrine
(D6 only). The parasites exhibited elevated IC50s to multiple artemisinins, with 
>twofold resistance to artemisinin; however, the resistance index obtained with
standard methods was noticeably less than expected for parasite lines recovered
from 50 µg/ml 48 h drug pressure. The change in parasite susceptibility was
associated with Pfmdr-185K mutation, a mutation never reported before. The
Pfcrt-CVMNK genotype (Pfcrt codons 72-76) was retained and notably, the study did
not detect any polymorphisms reported to reduce P. falciparum susceptibility in
vivo in the coding sequences of the Pfk13 gene.
DISCUSSION: This data demonstrate that P. falciparum has the capacity to develop 
resistance to artemisinin derivatives in vitro and that this phenotype is
achieved by mutations in Pfmdr1, the genetic changes that are also underpinning
lumefantrine resistance. This finding is of practical importance, because
artemisinin drugs in Kenya are used in combination with lumefantrine for the
treatment of malaria.
CONCLUSION: Artemisinin resistance phenotype as has been shown in this work, is a
decrease in parasites susceptibility to artemisinin derivatives together with the
parasite's ability to recover from drug-induced dormancy after exposure to drug
dosage above the in vivo clinical concentrations. The study surmises that Pfmdr1 
may play a role in the anti-malarial activity of artemisinin.
