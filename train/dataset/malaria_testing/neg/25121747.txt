The asexual forms of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum are adapted for
chronic persistence in human red blood cells, continuously evading host immunity 
using epigenetically regulated antigenic variation of virulence-associated genes.
Parasite survival on a population level also requires differentiation into sexual
forms, an obligatory step for further human transmission. We reveal that the
essential nuclear gene, P. falciparum histone deacetylase 2 (PfHda2), is a global
silencer of virulence gene expression and controls the frequency of switching
from the asexual cycle to sexual development. PfHda2 depletion leads to
dysregulated expression of both virulence-associated var genes and PfAP2-g, a
transcription factor controlling sexual conversion, and is accompanied by
increases in gametocytogenesis. Mathematical modeling further indicates that
PfHda2 has likely evolved to optimize the parasite's infectious period by
achieving low frequencies of virulence gene expression switching and sexual
conversion. This common regulation of cellular transcriptional programs
mechanistically links parasite transmissibility and virulence.
