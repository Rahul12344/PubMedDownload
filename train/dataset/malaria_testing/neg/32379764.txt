Due to the lack of efficiency to control malaria elicited by sub-unit vaccine
preparations, vaccination with live-attenuated Plasmodium parasite as reported 70
years ago with irradiated sporozoites regained recently a significant interest.
The complex life cycle of the parasite and the different stages of development
between mammal host and anopheles do not help to propose an easy vaccine
strategy. In order to achieve a complete long-lasting protection against
Plasmodium infection and disease, we considered a genetically attenuated blood
stage parasite in the hmgb2 gene coding for the high-mobility-group-box 2
(HMGB2). This Plasmodium protein belongs to the HMGB family and hold as the
mammal proteins, a double life since it acts first as a nuclear factor involved
in chromatin remodelling and transcription regulation and second, when secreted
as an active pro-inflammatory alarmin protein. Even though the number of reports 
on whole living attenuated blood stage parasites is limited when compared to
attenuated sporozoites, the results reported with Plasmodium KO parasites are
very encouraging. In this report, we present a novel strategy based on
pre-immunization with Δhmgb2PbNK65 parasitized red blood cells that confer
long-lasting protection in a murine experimental cerebral malaria model against
two highly pathogenic homologous and heterologous parasites.
