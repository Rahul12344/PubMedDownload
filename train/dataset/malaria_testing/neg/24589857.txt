Macroautophagy was initially considered to be a nonselective process for bulk
breakdown of cytosolic material. However, recent evidence points toward a
selective mode of autophagy mediated by the so-called selective autophagy
receptors (SARs). SARs act by recognizing and sorting diverse cargo substrates
(e.g., proteins, organelles, pathogens) to the autophagic machinery. Known SARs
are characterized by a short linear sequence motif (LIR-, LRS-, or AIM-motif)
responsible for the interaction between SARs and proteins of the Atg8 family.
Interestingly, many LIR-containing proteins (LIRCPs) are also involved in
autophagosome formation and maturation and a few of them in regulating signaling 
pathways. Despite recent research efforts to experimentally identify LIRCPs, only
a few dozen of this class of-often unrelated-proteins have been characterized so 
far using tedious cell biological, biochemical, and crystallographic approaches. 
The availability of an ever-increasing number of complete eukaryotic genomes
provides a grand challenge for characterizing novel LIRCPs throughout the
eukaryotes. Along these lines, we developed iLIR, a freely available web
resource, which provides in silico tools for assisting the identification of
novel LIRCPs. Given an amino acid sequence as input, iLIR searches for instances 
of short sequences compliant with a refined sensitive regular expression pattern 
of the extended LIR motif (xLIR-motif) and retrieves characterized protein
domains from the SMART database for the query. Additionally, iLIR scores xLIRs
against a custom position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and identifies
potentially disordered subsequences with protein interaction potential
overlapping with detected xLIR-motifs. Here we demonstrate that proteins
satisfying these criteria make good LIRCP candidates for further experimental
verification. Domain architecture is displayed in an informative graphic, and
detailed results are also available in tabular form. We anticipate that iLIR will
assist with elucidating the full complement of LIRCPs in eukaryotes.
