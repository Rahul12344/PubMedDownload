Sri Lanka is known for high diversity of phlebotomine sand flies and prevalence
of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis; a disease vectored by sand flies. The
taxonomy of phlebotomine sand flies is complicated and often the diversity is
over/underrated. The current study aims to use the cytochrome c oxidase gene
subunit 1 (COI) sequence and formulate a barcode for the sand fly species in Sri 
Lanka. A total of 70 samples comprising seven species morphologically identified 
and collected from dry zone districts of Hambantota, Anuradhapura, Vavuniya,
Trincomalee and Jaffna were processed. Neighbour-joining (NJ) tree created using 
the sequences revealed the species identity is compatible with the current
morphology based identification. Further the analysis delineated morphologically 
identified Se. bailyi, Se babu babu and Se babu insularis into genetically
distinct groups.
