BACKGROUND: The C-terminal 42 kDa domain of Plasmodium knowlesi merozoite surface
protein 1 (PkMSP1) is a potential asexual blood-stage vaccine candidate, however,
only a limited number of clinical isolates have been analysed from Malaysia and
no inter-country comparative diversity study has been conducted. In the present
study, nucleotide diversity, haplotypes and natural selection levels of pkmsp1 in
clinical samples from geographically distinct regions of Malaysia and Thailand
were investigated. The overall population structure of the parasite from the
region was determined.
METHODS: Eleven full-length pkmsp1 sequences obtained from clinical isolates of
Malaysia along with the H-strain were downloaded from the database for domain
wise characterization of pkmsp1 gene. Additionally, 76 pkmsp-142 sequences from
Thailand and Malaysia were downloaded from the database for intra and
inter-population analysis. DnaSP 5.10 and MEGA 5.0 software were used to
determine genetic diversity, polymorphism, haplotypes and natural selection.
Genealogical relationships were determined using haplotype network tree in
NETWORK software v5.0. Population genetic differentiation index (FST) of
parasites were analysed using Arlequin v3.5.
RESULTS: Sequence analysis of 11 full-length pkmsp1 sequences along with the
H-strain identified 477 (8.4%) polymorphic sites, of which 107 were singleton
sites. The overall diversity observed in the full-length genes were high in
comparison to its ortholog pvmsp1 and the 4 variable domains showed extensive
size variations. The nucleotide diversity was low towards the pkmsp1-42 compared 
to the conserved domains. The 19 kDa domain was less diverse and completely
conserved among isolates from Malaysian Borneo. The nucleotide diversity of
isolates from Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand were higher than Malaysian Borneo.
Network analysis of pkmsp1-42 haplotypes showed geographical clustering of the
isolates from Malaysian Borneo and grouping of isolates from Peninsular Malaysia 
and Thailand. Population differentiation analysis indicated high FST values
between parasite populations originating from Malaysian Borneo, Peninsular
Malaysia and Thailand attributing to geographical distance. Moderate genetic
differentiation was observed for parasite populations from Thailand and
Peninsular Malaysia. Evidence of population expansion and purifying selection
were observed in all conserved domains with strongest selection within the
pkmsp1-42 domain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report on inter country genetic diversity
and population structure of P. knowlesi based on msp1. Strong evidence of
negative selection was observed in the 42 kDa domain, indicating functional
constrains. Geographical clustering of P. knowlesi and moderate to high genetic
differentiation values between populations identified in this study highlights
the importance of further evaluation using larger number of clinical samples from
Southeast Asian countries.
