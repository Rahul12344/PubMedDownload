The cattle tick, Rhipicephalus microplus, is a monoxenous tick that co-evolved
with indicine cattle on the Indian subcontinent. It causes massive damage to
livestock worldwide. Cattle breeds present heritable, contrasting phenotypes of
tick loads, taurine breeds carrying higher loads of the parasite than indicine
breeds. Thus, a useful model is available to analyze mechanisms that determine
outcomes of parasitism. We sought to gain insights on these mechanisms and used
RNA sequencing and Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) to
generate a transcriptome from whole larvae and salivary glands from nymphs, males
and females feeding on genetically susceptible and resistant bovine hosts and
their corresponding proteomes. 931,698 reads were annotated into 11,676 coding
sequences (CDS), which were manually curated into 116 different protein families.
Male ticks presented the most diverse armamentarium of mediators of parasitism.
In addition, levels of expression of many genes encoding mediators of parasitism 
were significantly associated with the level and stage of host immunity and/or
were temporally restricted to developmental stages of the tick. These insights
should assist in developing novel, sustainable technologies for tick control.
