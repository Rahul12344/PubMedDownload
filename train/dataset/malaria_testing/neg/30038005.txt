Mosquito blood cells are immune cells that help control infection by vector-borne
pathogens. Despite their importance, little is known about mosquito blood cell
biology beyond morphological and functional criteria used for their
classification. Here, we combined the power of single-cell RNA sequencing,
high-content imaging flow cytometry, and single-molecule RNA hybridization to
analyze a subset of blood cells of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae By
demonstrating that blood cells express nearly half of the mosquito transcriptome,
our dataset represents an unprecedented view into their transcriptional program. 
Analyses of differentially expressed genes identified transcriptional signatures 
of two cell types and provide insights into the current classification of these
cells. We further demonstrate the active transfer of a cellular marker between
blood cells that may confound their identification. We propose that cell-to-cell 
exchange may contribute to cellular diversity and functional plasticity seen
across biological systems.
