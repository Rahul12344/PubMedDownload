Placental malaria (PM) is a complication associated with malaria infection during
pregnancy that often leads to abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth
restriction and low birth weight. Increased levels of circulating free heme, a
by-product of Plasmodium-damaged erythrocytes, is a major contributor to
inflammation, tissue damage and loss of blood brain barrier integrity associated 
with fatal experimental cerebral malaria. However, the role of heme in PM remains
unknown. Proliferation and apoptosis of trophoblasts and fusion of the
mononucleated state to the syncytial state are of major importance to a
successful pregnancy. In the present study, we examined the effects of heme on
the viability and fusion of a trophoblast-derived cell line (BeWo). Results
indicate that heme induces apoptosis in BeWo cells by activation of the
STAT3/caspase-3/PARP signaling pathway. In the presence of forskolin, which
triggers trophoblast fusion, heme inhibits BeWo cell fusion through activation of
STAT3. Understanding the effects of free plasma heme in pregnant women either due
to malaria, sickle cell disease or other hemolytic diseases, will enable
identification of high-risk women and may lead to discovery of new drug targets
against associated adverse pregnancy outcome.
