The spread of resistance to insecticides in disease-carrying mosquitoes poses a
threat to the effectiveness of control programmes, which rely largely on
insecticide-based interventions. Monitoring mosquito populations is essential,
but obtaining phenotypic measurements of resistance is laborious and error-prone.
High-throughput genotyping offers the prospect of quick and repeatable estimates 
of resistance, while also allowing resistance markers to be tracked and studied. 
To demonstrate the potential of highly-mulitplexed genotypic screening for
measuring resistance-association of mutations and tracking their spread, we
developed a panel of 28 known or putative resistance markers in the major malaria
vector Anopheles gambiae, which we used to screen mosquitoes from a wide swathe
of Sub-Saharan Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
and Kenya). We found resistance association in four markers, including a novel
mutation in the detoxification gene Gste2 (Gste2-119V). We also identified a
duplication in Gste2 combining a resistance-associated mutation with its
wild-type counterpart, potentially alleviating the costs of resistance. Finally, 
we describe the distribution of the multiple origins of kdr resistance, finding
unprecedented diversity in the DRC. This panel represents the first step towards 
a quantitative genotypic model of insecticide resistance that can be used to
predict resistance status in An. gambiae.
