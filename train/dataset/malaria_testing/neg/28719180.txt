The Plasmodium falciparum malarial parasite genome appears to encode one and only
one phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K), and sequence analysis suggests that
the enzyme is a "class III"- or "Vps34"-type PI3K. PfVps34 has generated
excitement as a possible druggable target and potentially a key target of
artemisinin-based antimalarials. In this study, we optimize the PfVps34 gene for 
heterologous expression in yeast, purify the protein to homogeneity, use a
recently validated quantitative assay for phosphatidylinositol 3'-phosphate
production from phosphatidylinositol ( Hassett et al., companion paper; DOI
10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00416 ) to quantify activity and drug inhibition of that
activity, and investigate the importance of key residues in the enzyme's
catalytic and "N-lobe" domains. Data suggest that PfVps34 is indeed inhibited by 
artemisinin and related drugs but only under conditions that cleave the drugs'
endoperoxide bridge to generate reactive alkylating agents.
