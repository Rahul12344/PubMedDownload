Drug discovery is a key part of malaria control and eradication strategies, and
could benefit from sensitive and affordable assays to quantify parasite growth
and to help identify the targets of potential anti-malarial compounds.
Bioluminescence, achieved through expression of exogenous luciferases, is a
powerful tool that has been applied in studies of several aspects of parasite
biology and high throughput growth assays. We have expressed the new reporter
NanoLuc (Nluc) luciferase in Plasmodium falciparum and showed it is at least 100 
times brighter than the commonly used firefly luciferase. Nluc brightness was
explored as a means to achieve a growth assay with higher sensitivity and lower
cost. In addition we attempted to develop other screening assays that may help
interrogate libraries of inhibitory compounds for their mechanism of action. To
this end parasites were engineered to express Nluc in the cytoplasm, the
parasitophorous vacuole that surrounds the intraerythrocytic parasite or exported
to the red blood cell cytosol. As proof-of-concept, these parasites were used to 
develop functional screening assays for quantifying the effects of Brefeldin A,
an inhibitor of protein secretion, and Furosemide, an inhibitor of new permeation
pathways used by parasites to acquire plasma nutrients.
