BACKGROUND: Urban malaria is now considered a major emerging health problem in
Africa and urban insecticide resistance may represent a serious threat to the
ambitious programme of further scaling-up coverage with long-lasting
insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spray. This study evaluates the 
levels and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae populations 
in 44 urban areas of Dakar in a longitudinal entomological surveillance study.
METHODS: Adult mosquitoes sampled by night-landing catches at 44 sites across
Dakar from 2007 to 2010 were genotyped to assess the frequency and distribution
of resistance alleles. In addition World Health Organization susceptibility tests
to six insecticides were performed on F0 adults issuing from immature stages of
An. gambiae s.l. sampled in August 2010, 2011 and 2012 in three sites of Dakar:
Pikine, Thiaroye and Almadies and repeated in 2012 with three of the insecticides
after PBO exposure to test for mechanisms of oxydase resistance. Species,
molecular forms and the presence of kdr and ace-1 mutations were assessed by
polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: High frequencies of the kdr-e allele, ranging from 35 to 100 %, were
found in Anopheles arabiensis at all 44 sites. The insecticide susceptibility
tests indicated sensitivity to bendiocarb in Almadies in 2010 and 2011 and in
Yarakh between 2010 and 2012 and sensitivity to fenitrothion in Almadies in 2010.
The mortality rate of EE genotype mosquitoes was lower and that of SS mosquitoes 
was higher than that of SE mosquitoes, while the mortality rate of the SW
genotype was slightly higher than that of the SE genotype. Pyperonyl butoxide
(PBO) had a significant effect on mortality in Pikine (OR = 1.4, 95 % CI =
1.3-1.5, with mortality of 42-55 % after exposure and 11-17 % without PBO) and
Yarakh (OR = 1.6, 95 % CI = 1.4-1.7, with mortality of 68-81 % after exposure and
23-37 % without), but not in Almadies (OR = 1.0, 95 % CI = 0.9-1.1).
CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of kdr-e in West Africa was demonstrated, and
knock-down resistance mechanisms predominate although some oxidases mechanisms
(cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) also occur. In view of the increased use of
insecticides and the proposed role of the kdr gene in the susceptibility of
Anopheles to Plasmodium, this finding will significantly affect the success of
vector control programmes.
