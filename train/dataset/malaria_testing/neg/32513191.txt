BACKGROUND: Genetic diversity in Plasmodium falciparum poses a major threat to
malaria control and elimination interventions. Characterization of the genetic
diversity of P. falciparum strains can be used to assess intensity of parasite
transmission and identify potential deficiencies in malaria control programmes,
which provides vital information to evaluating malaria elimination efforts. This 
study investigated the P. falciparum genetic diversity and genotype multiplicity 
of infection in parasite isolates from cases with uncomplicated P. falciparum
malaria in Southwest Ethiopia.
METHODS: A total of 80 P. falciparum microscopy and qPCR positive blood samples
were collected from study participants aged 6 months to 60 years, who visited the
health facilities during study evaluating the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine
from September-December, 2017. Polymorphic regions of the msp-1 and msp-2 were
genotyped by nested polymerase chain reactions (nPCR) followed by gel
electrophoresis for fragment analysis.
RESULTS: Of 80 qPCR-positive samples analysed for polymorphisms on msp-1 and
msp-2 genes, the efficiency of msp-1 and msp-2 gene amplification reactions with 
family-specific primers were 95% and 98.8%, respectively. Allelic variation of
90% (72/80) for msp-1 and 86.2% (69/80) for msp-2 were observed. K1 was the
predominant msp-1 allelic family detected in 20.8% (15/72) of the samples
followed by MAD20 and RO33. Within msp-2, allelic family FC27 showed a higher
frequency (26.1%) compared to IC/3D7 (15.9%). Ten different alleles were observed
in msp-1 with 6 alleles for K1, 3 alleles for MAD20 and 1 allele for RO33. In
msp-2, 19 individual alleles were detected with 10 alleles for FC27 and 9 alleles
for 3D7. Eighty percent (80%) of isolates had multiple genotypes and the overall 
mean multiplicity of infection was 3.2 (95% CI 2.87-3.46). The heterozygosity
indices were 0.43 and 0.85 for msp-1 and msp-2, respectively. There was no
significant association between multiplicity of infection and age or parasite
density.
CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed high levels of genetic diversity and mixed-strain
infections of P. falciparum populations in Chewaka district, Ethiopia, suggesting
that both endemicity level and malaria transmission remain high and that
strengthened control efforts are needed in Ethiopia.
