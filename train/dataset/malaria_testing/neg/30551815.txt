Transcriptomic, proteomic and genomic studies significantly improved our
understanding of the complexity of blood feeding insect saliva providing
unparalleled evolutionary insights. Salivary genes appeared to be under strong
selective pressure with gene duplication and functional diversification being a
powerful driver in the evolution of novel salivary genes/functions. The first
insect salivary proteins responsible for complement inhibition were identified
and a widespread mechanism of action shared by unrelated salivary protein
families was recognized and named kratagonism. microRNAs were for the first time 
described in the saliva of a few blood feeding arthropods raising intriguing
questions on their possible contribution to vertebrate host manipulation and
pathogen transmission and further emphasizing how much we still have to learn on 
blood feeding insect saliva.
