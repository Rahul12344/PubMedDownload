CD8(+) T cells play a pathogenic role in the development of murine experimental
cerebral malaria (ECM) induced by Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in
C57BL/6 mice. Only a limited number of CD8(+) epitopes have been described. Here,
we report the identification of a new epitope from the bergheilysin protein
recognized by PbA-specific CD8(+) T cells. Induction and functionality of these
specific CD8(+) T cells were investigated in parallel with previously reported
epitopes, using new tools such as tetramers and reporter cell lines that were
developed for this study. We demonstrate that CD8(+) T cells of diverse
specificities induced during PbA infection share many characteristics. They
express cytolytic markers (gamma interferon [IFN-γ], granzyme B) and chemokine
receptors (CXCR3, CCR5) and damage the blood-brain barrier in vivo. Our earlier
finding that brain microvessels in mice infected with PbA, but not with
non-ECM-causing strains, cross-presented a shared epitope was generalizable to
these additional epitopes. Suppressing the induction of specific CD8(+) T cells
through tolerization with a high-dose peptide injection was unable to confer
protection against ECM, suggesting that CD8(+) T cells of other specificities
participate in this process. The tools that we developed can be used to further
investigate the heterogeneity of CD8(+) T cell responses that are involved in
ECM.
