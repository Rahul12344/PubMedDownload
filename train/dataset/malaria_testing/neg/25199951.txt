BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is one of the widespread human malarial parasites
accounting for 75% of malaria epidemics. However, there is no baseline
information about the status and nature of genetic variation of Plasmodium
species circulating in various parts of Pakistan. The present study was aimed at 
observing the molecular epidemiology and genetic variation of Plasmodium vivax by
analysing its merozoite surface protein-3α (msp-3α) and merozoite surface
protein-3β (msp-3β) genes, by using suballele, species-specific, combined nested 
PCR/RFLP detection techniques.
METHODS: A total of 230 blood samples from suspected subjects tested slide
positive for vivax malaria were collected from Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
and Balochistan during the period May 2012 to December 2013. Combined nested
PCR/RFLP technique was conducted using Pvmsp-3α and Pvmsp-3β genetic markers to
detect extent of genetic variation in clinical isolates of P. vivax in the
studied areas of Pakistan.
RESULTS: By PCR, P. vivax, 202/230 (87.82%), was found to be widely distributed
in the studied areas. PCR/RFLP analysis showed a high range of allelic variations
for both msp-3α and msp-3β genetic markers of P. vivax, i.e., 21 alleles for
msp-3α and 19 for msp-3β. Statistically a significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) was
observed in the genetic diversity of the suballelic variants of msp-3α and msp-3β
genes of P. vivax.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that P. vivax populations are highly polymorphic and 
diverse allelic variants of Pvmsp-3α and Pvmsp-3β are present in Pakistan.
