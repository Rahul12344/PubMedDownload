BACKGROUND: Wolbachia are common intracellular bacteria that infect different
groups of arthropods including mosquitoes. These bacteria modify host biology and
may induce feminization, parthenogenesis, male killing and cytoplasmic
incompatibility (CI). Recently Wolbachia is being nominated as a bio-agent and
paratransgenic candidate to control mosquito borne diseases.
METHODS: Here we report the results of a survey for presence, frequency, and
phylogenetic congruence of these endosymbiont bacteria in Culex pipiens
populations in Northern, Central, and Southern parts of Iran using nested-PCR
amplification of wsp gene.
RESULTS: Wolbachia DNA were found in 227 (87.3%) out of 260 wild-caught
mosquitoes. The rate of infection in adult females ranged from 61.5% to 100%,
while in males were from 80% to 100%. The Blast search and phylogenetic analysis 
of the wsp gene sequence revealed that the Wolbachia strain from Iranian Cx.
pipiens was identical to the Wolbachia strains of supergroup B previously
reported in members of the Cx. pipiens complex. They had also identical sequence 
homology with the Wolbachia strains from a group of distinct arthropods including
lepidopteran, wasps, flies, damselfly, thrips, and mites from remote geographical
areas of the world.
CONCLUSION: It is suggested that Wolbachia strains horizontally transfer between 
unrelated host organisms over evolutionary time. Also results of this study
indicates that Wolbachia infections were highly prevalent infecting all Cx.
pipiens populations throughout the country, however further study needs to define
Wolbachia inter-population reproductive incompatibility pattern and its
usefulness as a bio-agent control measure.
