BACKGROUND: The acquisition of multidrug resistance by Plasmodium falciparum
underscores the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms so as to
counter their impact on malaria control. For the many antimalarials whose mode of
action relates to inhibition of heme detoxification inside infected erythrocytes,
the digestive vacuole transporters PfCRT and PfMDR1 constitute primary resistance
determinants.
RESULTS: Using gene expression microarrays over the course of the parasite
intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle, we compared the transcriptomic profiles
between P. falciparum strains displaying mutant or wild-type pfcrt or varying in 
pfcrt or pfmdr1 expression levels. To account for differences in the time of
sampling, we developed a computational method termed Hypergeometric Analysis of
Time Series, which combines Fast Fourier Transform with a modified Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis. Our analysis revealed coordinated changes in genes involved 
in protein catabolism, translation initiation and DNA/RNA metabolism. We also
observed differential expression of genes with a role in transport or coding for 
components of the digestive vacuole. Interestingly, a global comparison of all
profiled transcriptomes uncovered a tight correlation between the transcript
levels of pfcrt and pfmdr1, extending to dozens of other genes, suggesting an
intricate regulatory balance in order to maintain optimal physiological
processes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the mechanisms by which P.
falciparum adjusts to the acquisition of mutations or gene amplification in key
transporter loci that mediate drug resistance. Our results implicate several
biological pathways that may be differentially regulated to compensate for
impaired transporter function and alterations in parasite vacuole physiology.
