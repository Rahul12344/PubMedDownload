Plasmodium parasites, the causative agents of malaria, possess a distinctive
membranous structure of flattened alveolar vesicles supported by a proteinaceous 
network, and referred to as the inner membrane complex (IMC). The IMC has a role 
in actomyosin-mediated motility and host cell invasion. Here, we examine the
location, protein interactome and function of PhIL1, an IMC-associated protein on
the motile and invasive stages of both human and rodent parasites. We show that
PhIL1 is located in the IMC in all three invasive (merozoite, ookinete-, and
sporozoite) stages of development, as well as in the male gametocyte and locates 
both at the apical and basal ends of ookinete and sporozoite stages. Proteins
interacting with PhIL1 were identified, showing that PhIL1 was bound to only some
proteins present in the glideosome motor complex (GAP50, GAPM1-3) of both P.
falciparum and P. berghei. Analysis of PhIL1 function using gene targeting
approaches indicated that the protein is required for both asexual and sexual
stages of development. In conclusion, we show that PhIL1 is required for
development of all zoite stages of Plasmodium and it is part of a novel protein
complex with an overall composition overlapping with but different to that of the
glideosome.
