BACKGROUND: With the availability of complete genome sequences of both human and 
non-human Plasmodium parasites, it is now possible to use comparative genomics to
look for orthology across Plasmodium species and for species specific genes. This
comparative analyses could provide important clues for the development of new
strategies to prevent and treat malaria in humans, however, the number of
functionally annotated proteins is still low for all Plasmodium species. In the
context of genomes that are hard to annotate because of sequence divergence, such
as Plasmodium, domain co-occurrence becomes particularly important to trust
predictions. In particular, domain architecture prediction can be used to improve
the performance of existing annotation methods since homologous proteins might
share their architectural context.
RESULTS: Plasmobase is a unique database designed for the comparative study of
Plasmodium genomes. Domain architecture reconstruction in Plasmobase relies on
DAMA, the state-of-the-art method in architecture prediction, while domain
annotation is realised with CLADE, a novel annotation tool based on a
multi-source strategy. Plasmobase significantly increases the Pfam domain
coverage of all Plasmodium genomes, it proposes new domain architectures as well 
as new domain families that have never been reported before for these genomes. It
proposes a visualization of domain architectures and allows for an easy
comparison among architectures within Plasmodium species and with other species, 
described in UniProt.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasmobase is a valuable new resource for domain annotation in
Plasmodium genomes. Its graphical presentation of protein sequences, based on
domain architectures, will hopefully be of interest for comparative genomic
studies. It should help to discover species-specific genes, possibly underlying
important phenotypic differences between parasites, and orthologous gene families
for deciphering the biology of these complex and important Apicomplexan
organisms. In conclusion, Plasmobase is a flexible and rich site where any
biologist can find something of his/her own interest.
