The interaction of pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A) with influenza A H1N1
and H3N2 viruses was investigated. SP-A is a sialated C type lectin with affinity
for mannose residues. Flow cytometry showed that binding of fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled SP-A to H3N2 virus-infected cells was specific and 
time- and concentration-dependent. Oligosaccharides did not affect the binding of
FITC-SP-A to the infected cells. Preincubation of H1N1 and H3N2 with SP-A
resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of the infectivity of the viruses to
cells. Removal of the carbohydrate moiety of SP-A by N-glycosidase F or cleavage 
of its sialic acid residues by neuraminidase prevented the interactions of SP-A
with the viruses. It is concluded that SP-A binds to influenza A viruses via its 
sialic acid residues and, thereby, neutralizes the virus.
