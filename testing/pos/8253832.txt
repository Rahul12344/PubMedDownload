Expression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) structural proteins
requires the presence of the viral trans-activator protein Rev. Rev is localized 
in the nucleus and binds specifically to the Rev response element (RRE) sequence 
in viral RNA. Furthermore, the interaction of the Rev activation domain with a
cellular cofactor is essential for Rev function in vivo. Using cross-linking
experiments and Biospecific Interaction Analysis (BIA) we identify eukaryotic
initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) as a cellular factor binding specifically to the
HIV-1 Rev activation domain. Indirect immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that
a significant fraction of eIF-5A localizes to the nucleus. We also provide
evidence that Rev transactivation is functionally mediated by eIF-5A in Xenopus
oocytes. Furthermore, we are able to block Rev function in mammalian cells by
antisense inhibition of eIF-5A gene expression. Thus, regulation of HIV-1 gene
expression by Rev involves the targeting of RRE-containing RNA to components of
the cellular translation initiation complex.
