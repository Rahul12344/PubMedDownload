The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein is acetylated by the
transcriptional coactivator p300, a necessary step in Tat-mediated
transactivation. We report here that Tat is deacetylated by human sirtuin 1
(SIRT1), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent class III protein
deacetylase in vitro and in vivo. Tat and SIRT1 coimmunoprecipitate and
synergistically activate the HIV promoter. Conversely, knockdown of SIRT1 via
small interfering RNAs or treatment with a novel small molecule inhibitor of the 
SIRT1 deacetylase activity inhibit Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV long
terminal repeat. Tat transactivation is defective in SIRT1-null mouse embryonic
fibroblasts and can be rescued by expression of SIRT1. These results support a
model in which cycles of Tat acetylation and deacetylation regulate HIV
transcription. SIRT1 recycles Tat to its unacetylated form and acts as a
transcriptional coactivator during Tat transactivation.
