Here we investigated how capping and methylation of HIV pre-mRNAs are coupled to 
Pol II elongation. Stable binding of the capping enzyme (Mce1) and cap
methyltransferase (Hcm1) to template-engaged Pol II depends on CTD
phosphorylation, but not on nascent RNA. Both Mce1 and Hcm1 travel with Pol II
during elongation. The capping and methylation reactions cannot occur until the
nascent pre-mRNA has attained a chain length of 19-22 nucleotides. HIV pre-mRNAs 
are capped quantitatively when elongation complexes are halted at
promoter-proximal positions, but capping is much less efficient during unimpeded 
Pol II elongation. Cotranscriptional capping of HIV mRNA is strongly stimulated
by Tat, and this stimulation requires the C-terminal segment of Tat that mediates
its direct binding to Mce1. Our findings implicate capping in an elongation
checkpoint critical to HIV gene expression.
