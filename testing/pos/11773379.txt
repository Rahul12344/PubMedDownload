Hormones and neurotransmitters utilize cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a second messenger in
signal transduction pathways to regulate cell growth and division,
differentiation, gene expression, and metabolism. Adeno-associated virus type 2
(AAV-2) nonstructural protein Rep78 inhibits members of the cAMP signal
transduction pathway, the protein kinases PKA and PRKX. We mapped the kinase
binding and inhibition domain of Rep78 for PRKX to amino acids (aa) 526 to 561
and that for PKA to aa 526 to 621. These polypeptides were as potent as
full-length Rep78 in kinase inhibition, which suggests that the kinase-inhibitory
domain is entirely contained in these Rep peptides. Steady-state kinetic analysis
of Rep78-mediated inhibition of PKA and PRKX showed that Rep78 appears to
increase the K(m) value of the peptide kinase substrate, while the maximal
velocity of the reaction was unaffected. This indicates that Rep78 acts as a
competitive inhibitor with respect to the peptide kinase substrate. We detected
homology between a cellular pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKA, the protein kinase 
inhibitor PKI, and the PRKX and PKA inhibition domains of Rep78. Due to this
homology and the competitive inhibition mechanism of Rep78, we propose that Rep78
inhibits PKA and PRKX kinase activity by pseudosubstrate inhibition.
