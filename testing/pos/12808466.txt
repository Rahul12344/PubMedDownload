Viral replication usually requires that innate intracellular lines of defence be 
overcome, a task usually accomplished by specialized viral gene products. The
virion infectivity factor (Vif) protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is 
required during the late stages of viral production to counter the antiviral
activity of APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme, catalytic
polypeptide-like 3G; also known as CEM15), a protein expressed notably in human T
lymphocytes. When produced in the presence of APOBEC3G, vif-defective virus is
non-infectious. APOBEC3G is closely related to APOBEC1, the central component of 
an RNA-editing complex that deaminates a cytosine residue in apoB messenger RNA. 
APOBEC family members also have potent DNA mutator activity through dC
deamination; however, whether the editing potential of APOBEC3G has any relevance
to HIV inhibition is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that it does, as APOBEC3G
exerts its antiviral effect during reverse transcription to trigger G-to-A
hypermutation in the nascent retroviral DNA. We also find that APOBEC3G can act
on a broad range of retroviruses in addition to HIV, suggesting that
hypermutation by editing is a general innate defence mechanism against this
important group of pathogens.
