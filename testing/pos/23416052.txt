Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) attachment to primary B cells initiates virus entry.
Although CD21 is the only known receptor for EBVgp350/220, a recent report
documents EBV-infected B cells from a patient genetically deficient in CD21. On
normal resting B cells, CD21 forms two membrane complexes: one with CD19 and
another with CD35. Whereas the CD21/CD19 complex is widely retained on
immortalized and B cell tumor lines, the related complement-regulatory protein
CD35 is lost. To determine the role(s) of CD35 in initial infection, we
transduced a CD21-negative pre-B cell and myeloid leukemia line with CD35, CD21, 
or both. Cells expressing CD35 alone bound gp350/220 and became latently infected
when the fusion receptor HLA II was coexpressed. Temporal, biophysical, and
structural characteristics of CD35-mediated infection were distinct from CD21.
Identification of CD35 as an EBV receptor uncovers a salient role in primary
infection, addresses unsettled questions of virus tropism, and underscores the
importance of EBVgp350/220 for vaccine development.
