The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes a potent transactivator, 
Tat, which functions through binding to a short leader RNA, called
transactivation responsive element (TAR). Recent studies suggest that Tat
activates the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR), mainly by adapting co-activator
complexes, such as p300, PCAF and the positive transcription elongation factor
P-TEFb, to the promoter. Here, we show that the proto-oncoprotein Hdm2 interacts 
with Tat and mediates its ubiquitination in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Hdm2 
is a positive regulator of Tat-mediated transactivation, indicating that the
transcriptional properties of Tat are stimulated by ubiquitination. Fusion of
ubiquitin to Tat bypasses the requirement of Hdm2 for efficient transactivation, 
supporting the notion that ubiquitin has a non-proteolytic function in
Tat-mediated transactivation.
