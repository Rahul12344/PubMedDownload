The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome is maintained as an extrachromosomal episome 
during latent infection of B lymphocytes. Episomal maintenance is conferred by
the interaction of the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) with a tandem array 
of high-affinity binding sites, referred to as the family of repeats (FR),
located within the viral origin of plasmid replication (OriP). How this
nucleoprotein array confers episomal maintenance is not completely understood.
Previous studies have shown that DNA replication forks pause and terminate with
high frequency at OriP. We now show that cellular DNA replication fork pausing
and protection factors Timeless (Tim) and Tipin (Timeless-interacting protein)
accumulate at OriP during S phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of Tim inhibits
OriP-dependent DNA replication and causes a complete loss of the closed-circular 
form of EBV episomes in latently infected B lymphocytes. Tim depletion also led
to the accumulation of double-strand breaks at the OriP region. These findings
demonstrate that Tim is essential for sustaining the episomal forms of EBV DNA in
latently infected cells and suggest that DNA replication fork protection is
integrally linked to the mechanism of plasmid maintenance.
