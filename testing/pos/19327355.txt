Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a recently identified host factor
that positively regulates the intracellular trafficking and stability of HIV-1
Gag. We here examine the molecular mechanism by which SOCS1 regulates
intercellular Gag trafficking and virus particle production. We find that SOCS1
colocalizes with Gag along the microtubule network and promotes microtubule
stability. SOCS1 also increases the amount of Gag associated with microtubules.
Both nocodazole treatment and the expression of the microtubule-destabilizing
protein, stathmin, inhibit the enhancement of HIV-1 particle production by SOCS1.
SOCS1 facilitates Gag ubiquitination and the co-expression of a dominant-negative
ubiquitin significantly inhibits the association of Gag with microtubules. We
thus propose that the microtubule network plays a role in SOCS1-mediated HIV-1
Gag transport and virus particle formation.
