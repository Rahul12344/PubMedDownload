HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is a dimeric enzyme mainly involved in the
replication of the viral genome. A filamentous phage cDNA expression library from
human lymphocytes was used to select cellular proteins interacting with HIV-1
reverse transcriptase Affinity selections using the bacterially expressed
monomeric large subunit of reverse transcriptase (p66) yielded host beta-actin.
This clone was expressed as glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein which was
identified by using a specific antibody against beta-actin. Furthermore we show
that also the eukaryotic beta-actin binds to either the large subunit of reverse 
transcriptase or to the Pol precursor polyprotein in vitro. The reverse
transcriptase/beta-actin interaction might be important for the secretion of
HIV-1 virions.
