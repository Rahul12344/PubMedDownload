Suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication, a causative agent for chronic
hepatitis, is an effective approach to controlling disease progression. Host
factors have a significant effect on viral replication efficiency and need to be 
better characterized. We have reported association between clinical virus load
and deletions in HBV viral promoter. We showed here that HBV genome with such
deletions led to decreased replication compared with wild type virus.
Consistently, the promoter with deletion showed lower activity. A cellular
transcription regulator recognizing the promoter with deletion was revealed in
gel shift assay and subsequently identified as SMARCE 1 through DNA-protein array
assay. The ability of SMARCE 1 in modulating the replication efficiency of HBV
was further demonstrated. Taken together, our studies show a direct dependence of
HBV on a host factor to modulate its replication efficiency, and provided a new
platform for molecular characterization of mechanisms of disease outcome as a
result of binding of new transcription factors to rearranged promoter sequences.
