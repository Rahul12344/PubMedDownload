Although human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef is essential for the induction of
AIDS, its biochemical function has remained an enigma. In this study, HIV Nef
protein is shown to associate with a serine-threonine kinase that recognizes
histone H4 as a substrate, is serologically related to rat p21-activated kinase
(PAK), and is specifically activated by Rac and Cdc42. These characteristics
define the Nef-associated kinase as belonging to the PAK family. PAKs initiate
kinase cascades in response to environmental stimuli, and their identification as
a target of Nef implicates these signaling molecules in HIV pathogenesis and
provides a novel target for clinical intervention.
