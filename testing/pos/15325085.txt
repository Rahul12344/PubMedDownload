We have investigated the ability of HIV-1 protease to cleave human complement
proteins of the classical complement pathway: C1q, C2 and C4 as well as the
regulatory protein, C1-inhibitor. Purified complement proteins were incubated
with recombinant HIV-1 protease in vitro and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting assay. The only cleavage site was found in N-terminal region of
C1-inhibitor, and it was located between residues Leu-32 and Phe-33 as determined
by amino acid sequence analysis of the 85 kDa proteolytic fragment after 12 Edman
degradation cycles. The HIV-1 protease cleavage sites were not found in C1q, C2
and C4 protein. HIV-1 protease-susceptible site in N-terminal region of
C1-inhibitor is very close to the cleavage sites of some other proteases that are
able to induce N-terminal proteolysis of the protein.
