The envelope of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) consists of a large number of
glycoproteins. The most abundant glycoprotein in the HCMV envelope is the
glycoprotein M (UL100), which together with glycoprotein N (UL73) form the gM/gN 
protein complex. Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that the gM
carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail (gM-CT) interacts with FIP4, a Rab11-GTPase
effector protein. Depletion of FIP4 expression in HCMV-infected cells resulted in
a decrease in infectious virus production that was also associated with an
alteration of the HCMV assembly compartment (AC) phenotype. A similar phenotype
was also observed in HCMV-infected cells that expressed dominant negative
Rab11(S25N). Recently, it has been shown that FIP4 interactions with Rab11 and
additionally with Arf6/Arf5 are important for the vesicular transport of proteins
in the endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) and during cytokinesis.
Surprisingly, FIP4 interaction with gM-CT limited binding of FIP4 with Arf5/Arf6;
however, FIP4 interaction with gM-CT did not prevent recruitment of Rab11 into
the ternary complex. These data argued for a contribution of the ERC during
cytoplasmic envelopment of HCMV and showed a novel FIP4 function independent of
Arf5 or Arf6 activity.
