Apoptosis represents an important cellular defence mechanism against viral
pathogens by virtue of its ability to remove infected cells. Consequently, many
viruses have developed numerous strategies to prevent or delay host cell
apoptosis in order to achieve productive replication. Here we report that
deletion of the F1L gene from the vaccinia genome results in increased apoptosis 
during infection. We demonstrate that F1L, which has no sequence homology to
Bcl-2 family members, inhibits apoptosis at the level of mitochondria by binding 
to Bak. As a consequence, F1L prevents Bak activation, oligomerization and
interaction with active Bax, all critical steps in the induction of apoptosis. We
demonstrate that residues 64-84 of F1L interact directly with the Bcl-2 homology 
domain 3 (BH3) domain of Bak. This region of F1L has limited sequence similarity 
to known Bak-interacting BH3 domains. We also find that such additional BH3-like 
domains exist in the vaccinia genome. We conclude that F1L uses this specific,
BH3-like domain to bind and inhibit Bak at the mitochondria.
