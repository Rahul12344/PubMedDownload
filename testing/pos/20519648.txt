Under selective pressure from host immunity, viruses have retained genes encoding
immunoevasins, molecules interfering with host viral recognition and clearance.
Due to their binding specificities, immunoevasins can be exploited as affinity
labels to identify host-encoded molecules of previously unsuspected importance in
defense against the relevant class of virus. We previously described an
orthopoxvirus MHC class I-like protein (OMCP) that binds with high affinity to
the activating receptor NKG2D on NK and T cell subsets, implicating NKG2D in
antiorthopoxvirus immunity. In this study, we report that OMCP also binds in an
NKG2D-independent manner to B cells and monocytes/macrophages. We identify murine
FcR-like 5 (FCRL5), an orphan immunoregulatory protein highly expressed by innate
B lymphocytes, as a specific receptor for OMCP. The three N-terminal Ig domains
of FCRL5 are required for OMCP binding. The targeting of FCRL5 by an
orthopoxvirus immunoevasin strongly implicates it in contributing to host defense
against zoonotic orthopoxviruses.
