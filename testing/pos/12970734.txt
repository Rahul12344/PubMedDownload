Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) can lead to the development
of cervical cancer. This process depends on the interaction of the virus-encoded 
oncoproteins, E6 and E7, with a variety of host regulatory proteins. As E7 shares
both functional and structural similarities with the Adenovirus E1a (Ad E1a)
protein, we were interested in investigating the possible interactions between E7
and the transcriptional coactivator p300, since it was originally identified as a
target of Ad E1a. Using a variety of assays, we show that E7s from both high- and
low-risk HPV types interact with p300. Mutational analysis of E7 maps the site of
the interaction to a region spanning the pRb-binding domain and the CKII
phosphorylation site. We also map the site of interaction on p300 largely to the 
CH1 domain. In addition, we demonstrate that the binding between 16E7 and p300 is
direct, and can be detected in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation and mammalian
two-hybrid assays. Finally, we show that E7 can abolish the p300-mediated E2
transactivation function, suggesting that complex formation between E7 and p300
may contribute to the regulation of E2 transcriptional activity.
