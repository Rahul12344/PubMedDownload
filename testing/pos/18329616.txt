The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 plays an important role in virion formation
and viral egress from cells. However, the host cell proteins and mechanisms
responsible for intracellular transport of VP40 prior to its contribution to
virion formation remain to be elucidated. Therefore we used coimmunoprecipitation
and mass spectrometric analyses to identify host proteins interacting with VP40. 
We found that Sec24C, a component of the host COPII vesicular transport system,
interacts specifically with VP40 via VP40 amino acids 303 to 307.
Coimmunoprecipitation and dominant-negative mutant studies indicated that the
COPII transport system plays a critical role in VP40 intracellular transport to
the plasma membrane. Marburg virus VP40 was also shown to use the COPII transport
system for intracellular transport. These findings identify a conserved
intersection between a host pathway and filovirus replication, an intersection
that can be targeted in the development of new antiviral drugs.
