Hepatitis B spliced protein (HBSP) encoded by a 2.2 kb singly spliced hepatitis B
virus (HBV) pre-genomic RNA (spliced between positions 2447 and 489 nt) is
involved in the pathogenesis of HBV infection, whereas the exact mechanism is far
from being fully elucidated. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid system using HBSP 
as bait was employed to screen binding partners for HBSP from a human liver cDNA 
library. The interaction between HBSP and fibrinogen γ chain (FGG) was further
confirmed in vitro using a GST pull-down assay and confirmed in vivo using a
mammalian two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation. It was identified that
this interaction is mediated by the N terminal 47 amino acid residues of HBSP.
HBSP could inhibit fibrin polymerization, factor XIIIa-mediated fibrin
cross-linking, adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen and ADP-stimulated platelet
aggregation. However, the interaction-mediating fragment 1-47 of HBSP is not
sufficient for the inhibitory activity on fibrinogen function. The findings
suggested that HBSP may participate in the hemostatic abnormality in patients
with HBV-related liver diseases.
