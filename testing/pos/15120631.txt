Chronic infection by HCV is closely correlated with liver diseases such as
cirrhosis, steatosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. To understand how long-term
interaction between HCV and the host leads to pathogenesis, we identified
cellular proteins that interact with NS5A and NS5B using a biochemical approach. 
Stable cell lines that express flag-NS5A or flag-NS5B under tetracycline
induction were generated. The induced flag-tagged proteins were
immunoprecipitated (IP'd) and associated proteins separated on 2D gels. Protein
spots that specifically co-IP'd with NS5A or NS5B were identified by mass
spectrometry. HSP27 was identified as a protein that specifically co-IP'd with
NS5A but not with NS5B. The N-terminal regions of NS5A (a.a. 1-181) and HSP27
(a.a. 1-122) were defined to be the domains that interact with each other. HSP27 
is generally distributed in the cytoplasm. When heat shocked, HSP27 is
concentrated in the ER where NS5A is co-localized.
