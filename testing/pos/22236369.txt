Human cytomegalovirus transient lytic DNA replication relies on the cis-acting
element oriLyt, six viral-encoded core proteins, the proposed DNA replication
initiator protein UL84, IE2, IRS1 and the gene products from the UL112/113 loci. 
In an effort to elucidate cellular and viral-encoded factors that may play a role
in oriLyt-dependent replication we used DNA-affinity purification and mass
spectrometry to isolate and identify several previously unknown cellular and
viral factors that interact with HCMV oriLyt DNA. These proteins include the
multifunctional hnRNP-K, BUB3, HMGB1, PTB-1, UL83, UL112/113, and IRS1. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed an interaction of several of these
factors with oriLyt. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments detected an interaction
between UL84 and hnRNP-K in infected and transfected cells. Knockdown of hnRNP K 
expression by siRNA inhibited the amplification of oriLyt in the transient assay.
Together, these data suggest a possible regulatory role in DNA replication for
several previously unidentified viral and cellular factors.
