The nuclear hormone receptors hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) and the retinoid
X alpha (RXRalpha) plus the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha
(PPARalpha) heterodimer support hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in
nonhepatoma cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF3) inhibits nuclear hormone
receptor-mediated viral replication. Inhibition of HBV replication by HNF3beta is
associated with the preferential reduction in the level of the pregenomic RNA
compared with that of precore RNA. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), encoded by the 
precore RNA, mediates part of the inhibition of viral replication by HNF3beta.
The amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain of HNF3beta is essential for
the inhibition of HBV replication. The activation of transcription by HNF3 from
HBV promoters downstream from the nucleocapsid promoter appears to contribute
indirectly to the reduction in the steady-state level of 3.5-kb HBV RNA, possibly
by interfering with the elongation rate of these transcripts. Therefore,
transcriptional interference mediated by HNF3 may also regulate HBV RNA synthesis
and viral replication.
