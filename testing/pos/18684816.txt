The E5 proteins of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are small hydrophobic proteins
that are expressed in the early and late stages of the viral life cycle; however,
their role in HPV pathogenesis is not clearly understood. In this study, a
split-ubiquitin yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) two-hybrid system was used to
identify B-cell-associated protein 31 (Bap31) as a binding partner of HPV E5
proteins. The association of these proteins was confirmed by
coimmunoprecipitation of complexes of Bap31 with either HPV type 16 (HPV16) or
HPV31 E5. In addition, Bap31 and E5 were found to colocalize in perinuclear
patterns consistent with localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutational
analysis of E5 identified amino acids in the extreme C terminus as important for 
stabilizing the interaction with Bap31. Deletion of these C-terminal amino acids 
of E5 in the context of complete HPV31 genomes resulted in impaired proliferative
capacity of HPV-positive keratinocytes following differentiation. When small
interfering RNAs were used to reduce the levels of Bap31, the proliferative
ability of HPV-positive keratinocytes upon differentiation was also reduced,
implicating Bap31 as a regulator of this process. These studies identify a novel 
binding partner of the high-risk HPV E5 proteins and provide insight into how the
E5 proteins may modulate the life cycle in differentiating cells.
