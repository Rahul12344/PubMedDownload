Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV) uses hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal2) as a cell entry
receptor. By making inactivating mutations to the catalytic residues of human
Hyal2, we found that hyaluronidase activity was dispensable for its receptor
function. The affinities of the JSRV envelope glycoprotein for Hyal2 and the
Hyal2 mutant were similar, and hyaluronan did not block either high-affinity
interaction or virus infection. While generating the Hyal2 mutant, we discovered 
that our previous analysis of the hyaluronidase activity of Hyal2 was affected by
a contaminating hyaluronan lyase, which we have identified as the
occlusion-derived baculovirus E66 protein of the recombinant baculovirus used to 
produce Hyal2. We now report that purified human Hyal2 is a weak acid-active
hyaluronidase.
