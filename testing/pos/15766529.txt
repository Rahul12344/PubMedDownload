Gag proteins direct the process of retroviral particle assembly and form the
major protein constituents of the viral core. The matrix region of the HIV-1 Gag 
polyprotein plays a critical role in the transport of Gag to the plasma membrane 
assembly site. Recent evidence indicates that Gag trafficking to late endosomal
compartments, including multivesicular bodies, occurs prior to viral particle
budding from the plasma membrane. Here we demonstrate that the matrix region of
HIV-1 Gag interacts directly with the delta subunit of the AP-3 complex, and that
this interaction plays an important functional role in particle assembly.
Disruption of this interaction eliminated Gag trafficking to multivesicular
bodies and diminished HIV particle formation. These studies illuminate an early
step in retroviral particle assembly and provide evidence that the trafficking of
Gag to late endosomes is part of a productive particle assembly pathway.
