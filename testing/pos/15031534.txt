Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) immediate-early (IE) 2 protein (IE2) may play
important but incompletely defined roles during infection. We used yeast
two-hybrid screening to detect proteins interacting with HHV-6 IE2, and found
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) and the beta subunit of
casein kinase 2 (CK2beta) specifically interacted with HHV-6 IE2. The
interactions were confirmed by GST pull-down assay, coimmunoprecipitation, and
colocalization studies. These findings indicate that the HHV-6 IE2 protein
interacts with hnRNP K and CK2, and these interactions may affect viral and
cellular RNA transcription and translation in viral replication.
