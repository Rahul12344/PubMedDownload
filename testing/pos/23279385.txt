The extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor dystroglycan (DG) serves as a cellular
receptor for the highly pathogenic arenavirus Lassa virus (LASV) that causes a
haemorrhagic fever with high mortality in human. In the host cell, DG provides a 
molecular link between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton via the adapter
proteins utrophin or dystrophin. Here we investigated post-translational
modifications of DG in the context of LASV cell entry. Using the tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor genistein, we found that tyrosine kinases are required for efficient
internalization of virus particles, but not virus-receptor binding. Engagement of
cellular DG by LASV envelope glycoprotein (LASV GP) in human epithelial cells
induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of DG. LASV GP binding
to DG further resulted in dissociation of the adapter protein utrophin from
virus-bound DG. This virus-induced dissociation of utrophin was affected by
genistein treatment, suggesting a role of receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in
the process.
