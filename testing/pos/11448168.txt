SH3 domains regulate many normal and pathological cellular processes by guiding
specific protein interactions. Studies on binding of HIV-1 Nef to the SH3 domain 
of the Hck tyrosine kinase have indicated an important role for the SH3 RT-loop
region in ligand binding. Here we have tested the potential of artificial
Hck-derived SH3 domains carrying tailored RT-loops providing high affinity for
Nef as intracellular inhibitors of Nef. These artificial SH3 domains efficiently 
associated with Nef in cells and thereby potently inhibited SH3-dependent Nef
functions, such as association with p21-activated kinase-2 and induction of the
transcription factor NFAT. On the other hand, biochemical and functional data
indicated that the Nef-targeted SH3 domains were not prone to compete with normal
SH3-mediated processes. Thus, RT-loop-modified SH3 domains represent a novel
approach for selectively interfering with cellular signaling events, which could 
be exploited in research as well as in therapeutic applications.
