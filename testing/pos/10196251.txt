It has been reported that human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) bound to
follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) remains highly infectious to CD4(+) T cells
even when it forms immune complexes with neutralizing antibody (HIV-1/IC). To
elucidate the role of FDCs in HIV-1 transmission to CD4(+) T cells in lymph
nodes, we have isolated and purified FDCs from human tonsils and examined whether
the HIV-1/IC trapped on their surface is infectious to CD4(+) T cells. To our
surprise, not the HIV-1/IC but the antibody-free HIV-1 on FDCs could be
transmitted to CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to previous studies
showing that FDCs are productively infected with HIV-1, the present study clearly
demonstrated that FDCs were not the target cells for HIV-1 infection. FDCs could 
capture the viral particles on their surface; however, the binding of HIV-1 to
FDCs was strongly inhibited by the presence of anti-CD54 (ICAM-1) monoclonal
antibody (MAb) and anti-CD11a (LFA-1) MAb, suggesting that the adhesion molecules
play an important role in the interaction between HIV-1 and FDCs.
