The cDNA encoding adenovirus E1A enhancer-binding protein E1A-F was isolated by
screening a HeLa cell lambda gt11 expression library for E1A-F site-specific DNA 
binding. One cDNA clone produced recombinant E1A-F protein with the same DNA
binding specificity as that endogenous to HeLa cells. Sequence analysis of the
cDNA showed homology with the ETS-domain, a region required for sequence-specific
DNA binding and common to all ets oncogene members. Analysis of the longest cDNA 
revealed about a 94% identity in amino acids between human E1A-F and mouse PEA3
(polyomavirus enhancer activator 3), a recently characterized ets oncogene
member. E1A-F was encoded by a 2.5kb mRNA in HeLa cells, which was found to
increase during the early period of adenovirus infection. In contrast, ets-2 mRNA
was significantly reduced in infected HeLa cells. The results indicate that E1A
enhancer binding protein E1A-F is a member of the ets oncogene family and is
probably a human homologue of mouse PEA3.
