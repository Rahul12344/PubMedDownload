Field isolates of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) have been shown to use the 
RGD-dependent integrin alphavbeta3 as a cellular receptor on cultured cells.
However, several other RGD-dependent integrins may have the potential to act as
receptors for FMDV in vivo. Of these, alphavbeta6 is a likely candidate for use
as a receptor by FMDV as it is expressed on epithelial cells, which correlates
with the tissue tropism of the virus. In this report, we show that human colon
carcinoma cells (SW480) that are normally nonpermissive for FMDV become
susceptible to infection as a result of transfection with the integrin beta6
subunit and expression of alphavbeta6 at the cell surface. Integrin alphavbeta6
is the major site for virus attachment on the beta6-transfected cells, and
binding to alphavbeta6 serves to increase the rate of virus entry into these
cells. In addition, we show that virus binding and infection of the
beta6-transfected cells is mediated through an RGD-dependent interaction that is 
specifically inhibited by a monoclonal antibody (10D5) that recognizes
alphavbeta6. These studies establish a role for alphavbeta6 as a cellular
receptor for FMDV.
