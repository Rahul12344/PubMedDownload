The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) a sequence is present as a direct repeat 
at the two termini of the 152-kilobase viral genome and as an inverted repeat at 
the junction of the two unique components L and S. During replication, the HSV-1 
genome undergoes inversion of L and S, producing an equimolar mixture of the four
possible isomers. Isomerization is believed to result from recombination
triggered by breakage at the a sequence, a recombinational hot spot. We have
identified an enzyme in HeLa cell extracts that preferentially cleaves the a
sequence and have purified it to near homogeneity. Microsequencing showed it to
be human endonuclease G, an enzyme with a strong preference for G+C-rich
sequences. Endonuclease G appears to be the only cellular enzyme that can
specifically cleave the a sequence. Endonuclease G also showed the predicted
recombination properties in an in vitro recombination assay. Based on these
findings, we propose that endonuclease G initiates the a sequence-mediated
inversion of the L and S components during HSV-1 DNA replication.
