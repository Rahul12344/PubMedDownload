MDA5, a viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) receptor, shares sequence similarity
and signaling pathways with RIG-I yet plays essential functions in antiviral
immunity through distinct specificity for viral RNA. Revealing the molecular
basis for the functional divergence, we report here the crystal structure of MDA5
bound to dsRNA, which shows how, using the same domain architecture, MDA5
recognizes the internal duplex structure, whereas RIG-I recognizes the terminus
of dsRNA. We further show that MDA5 uses direct protein-protein contacts to stack
along dsRNA in a head-to-tail arrangement, and that the signaling domain (tandem 
CARD), which decorates the outside of the core MDA5 filament, also has an
intrinsic propensity to oligomerize into an elongated structure that activates
the signaling adaptor, MAVS. These data support a model in which MDA5 uses long
dsRNA as a signaling platform to cooperatively assemble the core filament, which 
in turn promotes stochastic assembly of the tandem CARD oligomers for signaling.
