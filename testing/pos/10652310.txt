A 193-kDa SV40 large T antigen (T-Ag)-binding protein, designated p193, was
identified and cloned. Inspection of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed the
presence of a short motif similar to the Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain 3, suggesting
that p193 may be a member of a family of apoptosis promoting proteins containing 
only BH3 motifs. In support of this, p193 expression promoted apoptosis in
NIH-3T3 cells. Deletion of the BH3 motif abolished p193 apoptosis activity.
p193-induced apoptosis was antagonized by co-expression of Bcl-X(L). Immune
cytologic analysis indicated that p193 is localized to the cytoplasm of
transfected cells. p193-induced apoptosis was also antagonized by co-expression
of T-Ag, which resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins. The
p193 binding site was mapped to an N-terminal region of T-Ag previously
implicated in transforming activity. These results suggest that T-Ag possesses an
antiapoptosis activity, independent of p53 sequestration, which is actuated by
T-Ag/p193 binding in the cytoplasm.
