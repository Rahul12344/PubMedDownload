HIV-1 pathogenicity factor Nef has been shown to modulate calcium signaling in
host cells, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained unclear. Here
we show that calcium/calcineurin-dependent activation of nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT) by Nef in Jurkat T cells requires the endoplasmic
reticulum-resident inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R), but yet does not
involve increase in phospholipase-C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1)-catalyzed production of
IP(3) or depletion of IP(3)-regulated intracellular calcium stores. Nef could be 
coprecipitated with endogenous IP(3)R type-1 (IP(3)R1) from Nef-transfected
Jurkat T cells as well as from HIV-infected primary human peripheral mononuclear 
cells. Thus, the Nef/IP(3)R1-interaction defines a novel T cell
receptor-independent mechanism by which Nef can promote T cell activation, and
appears to involve atypical IP(3)R-triggered activation of plasma membrane
calcium influx channels in a manner that is uncoupled from depletion of
intracellular calcium stores.
