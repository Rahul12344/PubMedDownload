An internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) that directs the initiation of viral
protein translation is a potential drug target for enterovirus 71 (EV71).
Regulation of internal initiation requires the interaction of IRES trans-acting
factors (ITAFs) with the internal ribosomal entry site. Biotinylated RNA-affinity
chromatography and proteomic approaches were employed to identify far upstream
element (FUSE) binding protein 2 (FBP2) as an ITAF for EV71. The interactions of 
FBP2 with EV71 IRES were confirmed by competition assay and by mapping the
association sites in both viral IRES and FBP2 protein. During EV71 infection,
FBP2 was enriched in cytoplasm where viral replication occurs, whereas FBP2 was
localized in the nucleus in mock-infected cells. The synthesis of viral proteins 
increased in FBP2-knockdown cells that were infected by EV71. IRES activity in
FBP2-knockdown cells exceeded that in the negative control (NC) siRNA-treated
cells. On the other hand, IRES activity decreased when FBP2 was over-expressed in
the cells. Results of this study suggest that FBP2 is a novel ITAF that interacts
with EV71 IRES and negatively regulates viral translation.
