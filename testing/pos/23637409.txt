We have identified host IQGAP1 as an interacting partner for Ebola virus (EBOV)
VP40, and its expression is required for EBOV VP40 virus-like particle (VLP)
budding. IQGAP1 is involved in actin cytoskeletal remodeling during cell
migration and formation of filopodia. The physical interaction and the functional
requirement for IQGAP1 in EBOV VP40 VLP egress link virus budding to the
cytoskeletal remodeling machinery. Consequently, this interaction represents a
novel target for development of therapeutics to block budding and transmission of
filoviruses.
