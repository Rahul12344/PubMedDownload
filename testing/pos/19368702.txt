Replication of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genome depends on host
factors for successfully completing their life cycles; to do this, host factors
have been recruited and/or relocated to the site of viral replication.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a cellular metabolic protein,
was found to colocalize with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5) in
JEV-infected cells. Subcellular fractionation further indicated that GAPDH
remained relatively constant in the cytosol, while increasing at 12 to 24 hours
postinfection (hpi) and decreasing at 36 hpi in the nuclear fraction of infected 
cells. In contrast, the redistribution patterns of GAPDH were not observed in the
uninfected cells. Co-immunoprecipitation of GAPDH and JEV NS5 protein revealed no
direct protein-protein interaction; instead, GAPDH binds to the 3' termini of
plus- and minus-strand RNAs of JEV by electrophoretic mobility shift assays.
Accordingly, GAPDH binds to the minus strand more efficiently than to the plus
strand of JEV RNAs. This study highlights the findings that infection of JEV
changes subcellular localization of GAPDH suggesting that this metabolic enzyme
may play a role in JEV replication.
