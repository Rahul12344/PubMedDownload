Retroviral integrase (IN) catalyzes the integration of viral cDNA into a host
chromosome. Additional roles have been suggested for IN, including uncoating,
reverse transcription, and nuclear import of the human immunodeficiency virus
type 1 (HIV-1) genome. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown.
Here, using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a survival motor neuron
(SMN)-interacting protein 1 (Gemin2) that binds to HIV-1 IN. Reduction of Gemin2 
with small interfering RNA duplexes (siGemin2) dramatically reduced HIV-1
infection in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages and also reduced viral
cDNA synthesis. In contrast, siGemin2 did not affect HIV-1 expression from the
integrated proviral DNA. Although Gemin2 was undetectable in cell-free viral
particles, coimmunoprecipitation experiments using FLAG-tagged Gemin2 strongly
suggested that Gemin2 interacts with the incoming viral genome through IN.
Further experiments reducing SMN or other SMN-interacting proteins suggested that
Gemin2 might act on HIV-1 either alone or with unknown proteins to facilitate
efficient viral cDNA synthesis soon after infection. Thus, we provide the
evidence for a novel host protein that binds to HIV-1 IN and facilitates viral
cDNA synthesis and subsequent steps that precede integration in vivo.
