Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) genes 7L and 145R are located on opposite ends of 
the genome and are predicted to encode 7-transmembrane proteins (7-TM) that share
53 and 44 % amino acid identity, respectively, to human CC chemokine receptor 8
(hCCR8). In this report, we demonstrate that early after infection with YLDV,
cells acquire the ability to bind human CCL1. By expression of genes 7L and 145R 
in vaccinia virus, we demonstrated that each protein is glycosylated and is
exposed on the cell surface with the N terminus outside the cell. Protein 7L, but
not 145R, is able to bind hCCL1 (K(d)=0.6+/-0.13 nM) and couple to heterotrimeric
G-proteins and to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2).
7L binds several chemokines including the viral chemokines vMIPI and vMIPII and
hCCL7/MCP3. This binding seems species-specific as 7L does not bind the murine
orthologues of CCL1 and CCL7 in the assays used. This represents the first
example of a poxviral 7-TM chemokine receptor that has functional interactions
with a human chemokine.
