Infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) of herpes simplex virus 1, a multifunctional ring 
finger protein, enhances the expression of genes introduced into cells by
infection or transfection, interacts with numerous cellular and viral proteins,
and is associated with the degradation of several cellular proteins. Sequences
encoded by exon 2 of ICP0 (residues 20-241) bind the UbcH3 (cdc34)
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, and its carboxy terminus expresses a ubiquitin
ligase activity demonstrable by polyubiquitylation of cdc34 in vitro. We report
that: (i) The physical interaction of cdc34 and ICP0 leads to its degradation.
Thus, substitution of ICP0 aspartate 199 with alanine attenuates the degradation 
of cdc34 and its binding to the ICP0 ring finger domain. (ii) Substitution of
residue 620 reported to abolish the interaction with a ubiquitin-specific
protease has no effect on the function of ubiquitin ligase. (iii) ICP0 contains
an additional distinct E3 ligase activity specific for the UbcH5a- and UbcH6
E2-conjugating enzymes mapping to the ring finger domain. This is, to our
knowledge, the first identification of a viral protein with at least two
physically separated E3 ligase activities with different E2 specificities. The
results suggest that each activity may target different proteins.
