Herpes simplex virus type 1 is an important epithelial pathogen and has the
potential for significant morbidity in humans. Here we demonstrate that a cell
surface scavenger receptor, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure
(MARCO), previously thought to enhance antiviral defense by enabling nucleic acid
recognition, is usurped by herpes simplex virus type 1 and functions together
with heparan sulphate proteoglycans to mediate adsorption to epithelial cells.
Ligands of MARCO dramatically inhibit herpes simplex virus type 1 adsorption and 
infection of human keratinocytes and protect mice against infection. Herpes
simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein C closely co-localizes with MARCO at the cell
surface, and glycoprotein C binds directly to purified MARCO with high affinity. 
Increasing MARCO expression enhances herpes simplex virus type 1 infection while 
MARCO(-/-) mice have reduced susceptibility to infection by herpes simplex virus 
type 1. These findings demonstrate that herpes simplex virus type 1 binds to
MARCO to enhance its capacity for disease, and suggests a new therapeutic target 
to alter pathogenicity of herpes simplex virus type 1 in skin infection.
