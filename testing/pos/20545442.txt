Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) or its immediate-early IE86 protein alone induces
cell cycle in quiescent primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs), but blocks its
progression at the G1/S interphase and inhibits cellular DNA synthesis by a
mechanism that is not clearly understood. It is assumed that, in this phenomenon,
the binding of minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins to replication origins
is blocked. In this work, we analyzed the initiation of DNA replication in
HCMV-permissive U373MG cells and used oriP of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a
simplified model of a cellular replication origin. Using U373MG cells we found
that HCMV IE86 protein was bound to Mcm3, but did not inhibit the cellular DNA
synthesis. Using U373MG-p220.2 cells carrying EBV oriP and expressing
Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), we found that EBNA1 as well as Mcm3 were 
bound to oriP and that neither HCMV nor IE86 protein inhibited the binding of
Mcm3 to oriP. Differences between the effects of HCMV on the cell cycle
progression in HFFs and U373MG cells are discussed.KEYWORDS: cell cycle; Human
