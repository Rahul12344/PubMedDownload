Both NS3 protein (1007-1657) and its protease moiety (NS3p, 1027-1207) were able 
to interact in vitro with C1 Inhibitor (C1Inh) to give a 95-kDa Mr C1Inh cleavage
product similar to that obtained upon proteolysis by complement protease C1s.
High-Mr reaction products were also detected after incubation of C1Inh with NS3
but not with NS3p; they correspond to ester-bonded complexes from their
hydroxylamine lability. Similar reactivity of NS3 was observed upon incubation
with alpha2-antiplasmin. Serpin cleavage was prevented by treatment of NS3 with
synthetic serine protease inhibitors. This interaction between viral NS3 and host
serpins suggests that NS3 is likely to be controlled by infected cell protease
inhibitors.
