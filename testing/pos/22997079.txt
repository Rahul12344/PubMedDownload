Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has recently re-emerged causing millions of infections 
in countries around the Indian Ocean. While CHIKV has a broad host cell range and
productively infects a number of different cell types, macrophages have been
identified as a potential viral reservoir serving to increase the duration of
symptoms. To date no CHIKV interacting protein has been characterized and this
study sought to identify CHIKV binding proteins expressed on target cell
membranes. Two-dimensional virus overlay identified prohibitin (PHB) as a
microglial cell expressed CHIKV binding protein. Co-localization,
co-immunoprecipitation as well as antibody and siRNA mediated infection
inhibition studies all confirmed a role for PHB in mediating internalization of
CHIKV into microglial cells. PHB is the first identified CHIKV receptor protein, 
and this study is evidence that PHB may play a role in the internalization of
multiple viruses.
