NS2 from influenza A virus mediates Crm1-dependent vRNP nuclear export through
interaction with Crm1. However, even though the nuclear export signal 1 (NES1) of
NS2 does not play a requisite role in NS2-Crm1 interaction, there is no doubt
that NES1 is crucial for vRNP nuclear export. While the mechanism of the NES1 is 
still unclear, it is speculated that certain host partners might mediate the NES1
function through their interaction with NES1. In the present study,
chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding protein 3 (CHD3) was identified as a novel host
nuclear protein for locating NS2 and Crm1 on dense chromatin for NS2 and
Crm1-dependent vRNP nuclear export. CHD3 was confirmed to interact with NES1 in
NS2, and a disruption to this interaction by mutation in NES1 significantly
delayed viral vRNPs export and viral propagation. Further, the knockdown of CHD3 
would affect the propagation of the wild-type virus but not the mutant with the
weakened NS2-CHD3 interaction. Therefore, this study demonstrates that NES1 is
required for maximal binding of NS2 to CHD3, and that the NS2-CHD3 interaction on
the dense chromatin contributed to the NS2-mediated vRNP nuclear export.
