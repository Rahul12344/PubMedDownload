The myxoma and malignant rabbit fibroma poxviruses are lethal tumorigenic viruses
of rabbits whose virulence is modulated by the production of a virus-encoded
secreted serine proteinase inhibitor, SERP-1. This viral protein was detected in 
medium harvested from myxoma and malignant rabbit fibroma virus-infected cells,
and its inhibitory profile has been characterized by gel and kinetic analysis.
SERP-1 forms complexes with and inhibits the human fibrinolytic enzymes plasmin, 
urokinase, and two-chain tissue-type plasminogen activator (association rate
constants 3.4 x 10(4), 4.3 x 10(4), and 3.6 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 respectively). It is 
also able to inhibit C1S, the first enzyme in the complement cascade with an
association rate constant which was unaffected by the addition of heparin (1.3 x 
10(3) M-1 s-1). SERP-1 acts as a substrate for and is cleaved by thrombin,
porcine trypsin, human neutrophil elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase,
thermolysin, subtilisin, bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, and factor Xa. Incubation
with kallikrein and cathepsin G had no effect. The structure of SERP-1 has been
modeled on other members of the serpin family which revealed the characteristic
serpin architecture apart from the absence of the D-helix. Structural analysis
and kinetic assays demonstrate that the absence of this region does not prevent
inhibitory activity and furthermore allow the identification of cysteine residues
involved in internal and intermolecular disulfide bonding.
