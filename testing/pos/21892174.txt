The recognition of pathogenic DNA is important to the initiation of antiviral
responses. Here we report the identification of DDX41, a member of the DEXDc
family of helicases, as an intracellular DNA sensor in myeloid dendritic cells
(mDCs). Knockdown of DDX41 expression by short hairpin RNA blocked the ability of
mDCs to mount type I interferon and cytokine responses to DNA and DNA viruses.
Overexpression of both DDX41 and the membrane-associated adaptor STING together
had a synergistic effect in promoting Ifnb promoter activity. DDX41 bound both
DNA and STING and localized together with STING in the cytosol. Knockdown of
DDX41 expression blocked activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase TBK1 
and the transcription factors NF-ÎºB and IRF3 by B-form DNA. Our results suggest
that DDX41 is an additional DNA sensor that depends on STING to sense pathogenic 
DNA.
