Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein transcriptionally modulates cellular genes and
promotes cell growth. NS5A is likely to exert its activity in concert with
cellular factor(s). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have demonstrated that
NS5A interacts with the C-terminal end of a newly identified cellular
transcription factor, SRCAP. The authenticity of this interaction was verified by
a mammalian two-hybrid assay, in vitro pull-down experiment, and an in vivo
coimmunoprecipitation assay in human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. An in vitro
transient transfection assay demonstrated that SRCAP can efficiently activate
transcription when recruited by the Gal4 DNA-binding domain to the promoter.
However, down-regulation of p21 promoter activity by NS5A was enhanced following 
ectopic expression of SRCAP. Together these results suggest that the interaction 
of NS5A and SRCAP may be one of the mechanisms by which NS5A exerts its effect on
cell growth regulation contributing to hepatitis C virus-mediated pathogenesis.
