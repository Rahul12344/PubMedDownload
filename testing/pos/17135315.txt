MKlp2 is a kinesin-like motor protein of the central mitotic spindle required for
completion of cytokinesis. Papillomavirus E2 is a sequence specific DNA binding
protein that regulates viral transcription and replication and is responsible for
partitioning viral episomes into daughter cells during cell division. We
demonstrate that MKlp2 specifically associates with the E2 protein during
mitosis. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show viral genomes are in
complex with MKlp2 only within this stage of cell cycle. By immunofluorescence, a
subpopulation of papillomavirus E2 colocalizes with MKlp2 in the midbody/midplate
during late mitosis. We conclude that during specific stages of mitosis, the
papillomavirus E2 protein binds to MKlp2, and infer that association with this
motor protein ensures viral genome partitioning during cytokinesis.
