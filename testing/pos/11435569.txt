The expression of the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) open reading
frame 50 (ORF50) protein, Lyta (lytic transactivator), marks the switch from
latent KSHV infection to the lytic phase. ORF50/Lyta upregulates several target
KSHV genes, such as K8 (K-bZip), K9 (vIRF1), and ORF57, finally leading to the
production of mature viruses. The auto-upregulation of ORF50/Lyta is thought to
be an important mechanism for efficient lytic viral replication. In this study,
we focused on this autoregulation and identified the promoter element required
for it. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that the
octamer-binding protein 1 (Oct-1) bound to this element. Mutations in the
octamer-binding motif resulted in refractoriness of the ORF50/Lyta promoter to
transactivation by ORF50/Lyta, and Oct-1 expression enhanced this
transactivation. These results suggest that the autoregulation of ORF50/Lyta is
mediated by Oct-1.
