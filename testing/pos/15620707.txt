Human neutrophil alpha-defensin 4 (HNP4) is more effective than HNP1-3 in
protecting human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infection by both X4 and
R5 HIV-1 strains. HNP4 binds to both CD4 and gp120 approximately two orders of
magnitude weaker than does HNP1, and is less effectively sequestered by
glycosylated serum proteins than HNP1. These results suggest that the HIV-1
inhibition by HNP4 stems at least partially from a unique and lectin-independent 
property of HNP4 with CD4 and/or gp120. Our finding identifies an anti-HIV-1
property of HNP4 and may have implications in the development of new antiviral
agents for AIDS therapy.
