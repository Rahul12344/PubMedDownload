The PPPY motif in the matrix (MA) domain of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
(HTLV-1) Gag associates with WWP1, a member of the HECT domain containing family 
of E3 ubiquitin ligases. Mutation of the PPPY motif arrests particle assembly at 
an early stage and abolishes ubiquitination of MA. Similar effects are seen when 
Gag is expressed in the presence of a truncated form of WWP1 that lacks the
catalytically active HECT domain (C2WW). To understand the role of ubiquitination
in budding, we mutated the four lysines in MA to arginines and identified lysine 
74 as the unique site of ubiquitination. Virus-like particles produced by the
K74R mutant did not contain ubiquitinated MA and showed a fourfold reduction in
the release of infectious particles. Furthermore, the K74R mutation rendered
assembly hypersensitive to C2WW inhibition; K74R Gag budding was inhibited at
significantly lower levels of expression of C2WW compared with wild-type Gag.
This finding indicates that the interaction between Gag and WWP1 is required for 
functions other than Gag ubiquitination. Additionally, we show that the PPPY(-)
mutant Gag exerts a strong dominant-negative effect on the budding of wild-type
Gag, further supporting the importance of recruitment of WWP1 to achieve particle
assembly.
