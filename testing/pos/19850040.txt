Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) ORF57 plays a pivotal role in
mediating the nuclear export of KSHV intronless transcripts. We demonstrate that 
ORF57 localises and dynamically trafficks through the nucleolus. To assess if
nucleolar shuttling of ORF57 is important for the export of intronless viral
mRNA, the ability of ORF57 to export mRNA was assessed in cells where the
nucleolus was disrupted using Actinomycin D or DRB. We show that rapid
disorganisation of the nucleolus was accompanied by a reduction in intronless
virus mRNA export, suggesting that an intact nucleolus is essential for efficient
KSHV ORF57-mediated intronless mRNA export.
