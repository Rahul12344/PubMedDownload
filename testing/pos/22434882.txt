The homologous cellular coactivators p300 and CBP contain intrinsic lysine acetyl
transferase (termed HAT) activity. This activity is responsible for acetylation
of several sites on the histones as well as modification of transcription
factors. In a previous study, we found that HBZ, encoded by the Human T-cell
Leukemia Virus type 1 (HTLV-1), binds to multiple domains of p300/CBP, including 
the HAT domain. In this study, we found that HBZ inhibits the HAT activity of
p300/CBP through the bZIP domain of the viral protein. This effect correlated
with a reduction of H3K18 acetylation, a specific target of p300/CBP, in cells
expressing HBZ. Interestingly, lower levels of H3K18 acetylation were detected in
HTLV-1 infected cells compared to non-infected cells. The inhibitory effect of
HBZ was not limited to histones, as HBZ also inhibited acetylation of the NF-ÎºB
subunit, p65, and the tumor suppressor, p53. Recent studies reported that
mutations in the HAT domain of p300/CBP that cause a defect in acetylation are
found in certain types of leukemia. These observations suggest that inhibition of
the HAT activity by HBZ is important for the development of adult T-cell leukemia
associated with HTLV-1 infection.
