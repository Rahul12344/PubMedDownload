The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 protein is important for the replication and
mitotic segregation of EBV genomes in latently infected cells and also activates 
the transcription of some of the viral latency genes. A Gly-Arg-rich region
between amino acids 325 and 376 is required for both the segregation and
transcriptional activation functions of EBNA1. Here we show that this region is
modified by both arginine methylation and serine phosphorylation. Mutagenesis of 
the four potentially phosphorylated serines in this region indicated that
phosphorylation of multiple serines contributes to the efficient segregation of
EBV-based plasmids by EBNA1, at least in part by increasing EBNA1 binding to
hEBP2. EBNA1 was also found to bind the arginine methyltransferases PRMT1 and
PRMT5. Multiple arginines in the 325-376 region were methylated in vitro by PRMT1
and PRMT5, as was an N-terminal Gly-Arg-rich region between amino acids 41 and
50. EBNA1 was also shown to be methylated in vivo, predominantly in the 325-376
region. Treatment of cells with a methylation inhibitor or down-regulation of
PRMT1 altered EBNA1 localization, resulting in the formation of EBNA1 rings
around the nucleoli. The results indicate that EBNA1 function is influenced by
both serine phosphorylation and arginine methylation.
