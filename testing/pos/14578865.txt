Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is a transcriptional coactivator that plays a
significant role in the regulation of genes involved in inflammation and cell
survival. A recently identified cellular coactivator, activating signal
cointegrator 2 (ASC-2), is enriched in liver cancer cells and associates with
many transcription factors that are active in hepatocytes. The tissue
colocalization of these 2 proteins, in view of their similar regulatory
functions, led us to examine whether HBx and ASC-2 cooperate in transcriptional
activation of gene expression. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays
and mammalian 2-hybrid analysis show that the transactivation domain of HBx
interacts with the C-terminal domain of ASC-2. In fact, these 2 proteins
associated in a ternary complex that included the transcriptional activator
retinoid X receptor (RXR). Mechanistically, on expression of HBx, the half-life
of the ASC-2 coactivator is observed to increase in concordance with the observed
increase in ASC-2-dependent coactivation of transcription. In conclusion, these
results show that HBx stabilizes the cellular coactivator ASC-2 through direct
protein-protein interaction, affecting the regulation of genes actively
transcribed in liver cancer cells.
