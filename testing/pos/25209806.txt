Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) glycoprotein M (gM) is an envelope glycoprotein that 
associates with glycoprotein N (gN), forming the gM/gN protein complex, in a
similar manner to the other herpesviruses. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis
showed that the HHV-6 gM/gN complex interacts with the v-SNARE protein,
vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3). VAMP3 colocalized with the gM/gN
complex at the trans-Golgi network and other compartments, possibly the late
endosome in HHV-6-infected cells, and its expression gradually increased during
the late phase of virus infection. Finally, VAMP3 was incorporated into mature
virions and may be transported with the gM/gN complex.
