The interaction between two regulatory proteins plays a crucial role in the
control of several biological events, including gene transcription. In this
report, we demonstrate that the interaction between the cellular
sequence-specific single-stranded DNA binding protein Puralpha and the HIV type 1
(HIV-1) Tat protein is mediated by specific ribonucleic acids. The region of Tat 
that is important for its interaction with Puralpha includes the region
demonstrated to bind Tat's viral RNA target, TAR. A 10-nucleotide GC-rich
consensus sequence identified in RNAs associated with Puralpha derived from human
U-87MG cells plays an important role in the Puralpha:Tat interaction as examined 
by an in vitro reconstitution assay. Furthermore, expression of the
Puralpha-associated RNA in these cells enhances transcriptional activation of the
HIV-1 promoter by Tat and Puralpha.
