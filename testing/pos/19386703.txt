After penetrating the host cell, the herpesvirus capsid is transported to the
nucleus along the microtubule network and docks to the nuclear pore complex
before releasing the viral DNA into the nucleus. The viral and cellular
interactions involved in the docking process are poorly characterized. However,
the minor capsid protein pUL25 has recently been reported to be involved in viral
DNA uncoating. Here we show that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) capsids
interact with the nucleoporin CAN/Nup214 in infected cells and that RNA silencing
of CAN/Nup214 delays the onset of viral DNA replication in the nucleus. We also
show that pUL25 interacts with CAN/Nup214 and another nucleoporin, hCG1, and
binds to the pUL36 and pUL6 proteins, two other components of the herpesvirus
particle that are known to be important for the initiation of infection and viral
DNA release. These results identify CAN/Nup214 as being a nuclear receptor for
the herpesvirus capsid and pUL25 as being an interface between incoming capsids
and the nuclear pore complex and as being a triggering element for viral DNA
release into the nucleus.
