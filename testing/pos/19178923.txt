Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an important pathogen in swine, whereas
porcine circovirus type 1 (PCV1) is apathogenic. To analyze the interactions
between PCV and its host, we have used a yeast two-hybrid assay to identify
cellular proteins interacting with Cap and Rep proteins of both PCV genotypes.
Six cellular proteins were found to interact with Cap (MKRN1, gC1qR, Par-4, NAP1,
NPM1 and Hsp40) and three with Rep (ZNF265, TDG and VG5Q). These interactions
were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Investigation of the localisation of
the proteins by immunofluorescence revealed in some cases only limited spatial
overlapping with Cap, while in others a clear co-localisation and prominent
protein redistribution was observed. The nine cellular proteins are associated
with distinct aspects of viral lifecycle and our data is likely to support future
research in the field of PCV2 pathogenesis.
