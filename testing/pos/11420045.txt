Cytotoxic lymphocytes kill virus-infected target cells and play a critical role
in host recovery from viral infections. Granzyme B (GrB) is a cytotoxic
lymphocyte granule protease that plays a critical role in mediating cytotoxicity.
In these studies, we demonstrate that the adenovirus assembly protein L4--100K
(100K) is a GrB substrate that prevents cytotoxic lymphocyte granule-induced
apoptosis in infected target cells by potently inhibiting GrB. This inhibition is
absolutely dependent on Asp-48 in 100K, found within a classic GrB consensus
motif. 100K is the first viral protein described that exclusively targets the GrB
pathway. It represents a novel class of viral protease inhibitor, in which an
essential, multifunctional viral protein, which is vulnerable to specific
proteolysis by GrB, expresses inhibitory function against that protease.
