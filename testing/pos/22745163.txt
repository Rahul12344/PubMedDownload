Recognition of viral nucleic acids by pattern recognition receptors initiates
type I IFN induction and innate antiviral immune response. Here we show that
LSm14A, a member of the LSm family involved in RNA processing in the processing
bodies, binds to synthetic or viral RNA and DNA and mediates IRF3 activation and 
IFN-β induction. Knockdown of LSm14A inhibits cytosolic RNA- and DNA-trigger type
I IFN production and cellular antiviral response. Moreover, LSm14A is essential
for early-phase induction of IFN-β after either RNA or DNA virus infection. We
further found that LSm14A-mediated IFN-β induction requires RIG-I-VISA or MITA
after RNA or DNA virus infection, respectively, and viral infection causes
translocation of LSm14A to peroxisomes, where RIG-I, VISA, and MITA are located. 
These findings suggest that LSm14A is a sensor for both viral RNA and DNA and
plays an important role in initiating IFN-β induction in the early phase of viral
infection.
