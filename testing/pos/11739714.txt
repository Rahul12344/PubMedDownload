Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent infection membrane protein 1 (LMP1) has an
intermediate domain between the two cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domains that
are critical for transforming B-lymphocytes into lymphoblastoid cell lines
(LCLs). The intermediate domain has been implicated in Janus kinase 3 (JAK3)
association and activation. We now find that LCLs transformed by EBV recombinants
that express Flag-LMP1 with the putative JAK3 binding and activating intermediate
domain deleted and LCLs transformed by Flag-LMP1 EBV recombinants have similar
levels of phosphotyrosine-activated JAK3, signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT3), or STAT5 and similar very low levels of JAK3 associated 
with LMP1. Further, transient Flag-LMP1 expression in a B-lymphoma cell line
transduces signals that upregulate TRAF1 levels but does not alter JAK3 levels or
activation state. Although these data indicate that the LMP1 putative JAK3
binding and activating intermediate domain does not mediate JAK3 association or
activation in B-lymphocytes, JAK3 association with LMP1 could be significant,
particularly in cells in which LMP1, JAK3, or a JAK3-associated protein is
expressed at high levels.
