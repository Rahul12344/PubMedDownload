5'-mRNA capping is an early modification that affects pre-mRNA
synthesis/splicing, RNA cytoplasmic transport, and mRNA translation and turnover.
In eukaryotes, a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is added to newly transcribed RNA
polymerase II (RNAP II) transcripts. A subset of RNAP II-transcribed cellular
RNAs, including small nuclear RNA (snRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and
telomerase RNA, is further hypermethylated at the exocyclic N2 of the guanosine
to create a trimethylguanosine (TMG)-capped RNA. Some of these TMG-capped RNAs
are transported within the nucleus and from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the
CRM-1 (required for chromosome region maintenance) protein. CRM-1 is also used to
export Rev/RRE-dependent unspliced/ partially spliced HIV-1 RNAs. Here we report 
that like snRNAs and snoRNAs, some Rev/RRE-dependent HIV-1 RNAs are TMG-capped.
The methyltransferase responsible for TMG modification of HIV-1 RNAs is the human
PIMT (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-interacting protein with
methyltransferase) protein. TMG capping of unspliced/partially spliced HIV-1 RNAs
represents a new regulatory mechanism for selective expression.
