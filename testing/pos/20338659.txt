BACKGROUNDS & AIMS: The hepatitis C virus NS3 protein is taken up by myeloid
cells in a TLR2-independent manner and activates myeloid cells via TLR2. This
study aimed to identify the endocytic receptor(s) involved in the uptake of NS3
by myeloid cells and its relation with TLR2.
METHODS: Inhibitors and transfected cells were used to identify the nature of the
NS3-binding receptors expressed by myeloid cells. The cooperation between
scavenger receptors (SRs) and TLR2 in the NS3-mediated activation of myeloid
cells was evaluated using inhibitors, cells from TLR2(-/-) mice, and confocal
microscopy. The involvement of SRs in NS3 cross-presentation was evaluated in
vitro using an NS3-specific human T-cell clone.
RESULTS: We observed that SRs are the main binding structures for NS3 on myeloid 
cells and identified the SRs SRA-1 and SREC-I as endocytic receptors for NS3.
Moreover, both SRs and TLR2 cooperate in NS3-induced myeloid cell activation.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights a central role for SRs in NS3 uptake and
cross-presentation, and demonstrates a tightly orchestrated cooperation between
signalling and endocytic innate receptors in NS3 recognition.
