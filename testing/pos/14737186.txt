The infectious cycle of primate lentiviruses is intimately linked to interactions
between cells of the immune system. Nef, a potent virulence factor, alters
cellular environments to increase lentiviral replication in the host, yet the
mechanisms underlying these effects have remained elusive. Since Nef likely
functions as an adaptor protein, we exploited a proteomic approach to directly
identify molecules that Nef targets to subvert the signaling machinery in T
cells. We purified to near homogeneity a major Nef-associated protein complex
from T cells and identified by mass spectroscopy its subunits as DOCK2-ELMO1, a
key activator of Rac in antigen- and chemokine-initiated signaling pathways, and 
Rac. We show that Nef activates Rac in T cell lines and in primary T cells
following infection with HIV-1 in the absence of antigenic stimuli. Nef activates
Rac by binding the DOCK2-ELMO1 complex, and this interaction is linked to the
abilities of Nef to inhibit chemotaxis and promote T cell activation. Our data
indicate that Nef targets a critical switch that regulates Rac GTPases downstream
of chemokine- and antigen-initiated signaling pathways. This interaction enables 
Nef to influence multiple aspects of T cell function and thus provides an
important mechanism by which Nef impacts pathogenesis by primate lentiviruses.
