Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) is essential for hepatitis B virus infection
and exerts a pleiotropic effect on various cellular machineries. HBx has been
also demonstrated as an indirect transcriptional transactivator of various
different viral and cellular promoters. In addition, HBx is involved in the
development of various liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma. However
the mechanism of HBx in hepatocellular carcinogenesis remains largely unknown. In
this study, to identify possible new cellular proteins interacting with HBx, we
carried out yeast two-hybrid assay. We obtained several possible cellular
partners including VBP1, a binding factor for VHL tumor suppressor protein. The
direct physical interaction between HBx and VBP1 in vitro and in vivo was
confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, we found that VBP1
facilitates HBx-induced NFkappaB activation and cell proliferation. These results
implicate the important role of HBx in the development of hepatocellular
carcinoma through its interaction with VBP1.
