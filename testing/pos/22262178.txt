Integrated high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was frequently detected in
the genomes of cervical carcinoma cells. The HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins disrupt
the functions of tumor suppressors p53 and Rb; thus, understanding the mechanism 
by which HPV E6 and E7 gene expression is regulated in cancer cells is highly
relevant to cancer biology. Brg1 is a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin 
remodeling complexes that function in the transcriptional regulation of certain
cellular genes. Here, we show that knockdown of Brg1 in HeLa cells leads to cell 
cycle arrest, p53 and Rb protein accumulation and, interestingly, downregulated
expression of HPV18 E6 and E7 genes. Brg1 binds the HPV18 LCR in a JunB- and
p300-dependent manner and is required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase
II to the HPV18 LCR. The function of Brg1 in HPV18 gene regulation is unique
given that its homolog Brm does not play a role in this regulatory pathway, and
this may help design target-specific intervention strategies.
