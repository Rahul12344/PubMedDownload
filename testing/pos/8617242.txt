The E7 gene product of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) binds to the
retinoblastoma gene product (pRb) and dissociates pRb-E2F complexes. However, the
observation that the ability of E7 to bind pRb is not required for the
HPV16-induced immortalization of primary keratinocytes prompted a search for
other cellular factors bound by E7. Using a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
fusion protein system, we show that E7 complexes with AP1 transcription factors
including c-Jun, JunB, JunD and c-Fos. The ability of E7 to complex with c-Jun in
vivo is demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and the yeast two-hybrid system.
An analysis of E7 point mutants in the GST system indicates that the E7
zinc-finger motif, but not the pRb binding domain, is involved in these
interactions. Using c-Jun deletion mutants, E7 binding maps between amino acids
224 and 286 of c-Jun. E7 trans-activates c-Jun-induced transcription from a Jun
responsive promoter, and this activity correlates with the ability of E7 mutants 
to bind Jun proteins. Finally, a transcriptionally inactive c-Jun deletion, which
can bind E7, interferes with the E7-induced transformation of rat embryo
fibroblasts in cooperation with an activated ras, indicating that the Jun-E7
interaction is physiologically relevant and that Jun factors may be targeted in
the E7 transformation pathway.
