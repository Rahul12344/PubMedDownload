Human CMV (HCMV) encodes multiple genes that control NK cell activation and
cytotoxicity. Some of these HCMV-encoded gene products modulate NK cell activity 
as ligands expressed at the cell surface that engage inhibitory NK cell
receptors, whereas others prevent the infected cell from upregulating ligands
that bind to activating NK cell receptors. A major activating NKR is the
homodimeric NKG2D receptor, which has eight distinct natural ligands in humans.
It was shown that HCMV is able to prevent the surface expression of five of these
ligands (MIC A/B and ULBP1, 2, and 6). In this article, we show that the HCMV
gene product UL142 can prevent cell surface expression of ULBP3 during infection.
We further show that UL142 interacts with ULBP3 and mediates its intracellular
retention in a compartment that colocalizes with markers of the cis-Golgi
complex. In doing so, UL142 prevents ULBP3 trafficking to the surface and
protects transfected cells from NK-mediated cytotoxicity. This is the first
description of a viral gene able to mediate downregulation of ULBP3.
