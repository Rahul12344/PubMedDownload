Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) regulates NF-kappaB during infection by a variety of
mechanisms. For example, the HCMV gene product, UL144, is known to activate
NF-kappaB in a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factor 6
(TRAF6)-dependent manner, causing the upregulation of the chemokine CCL22 (MDC). 
Viral UL144 is expressed from the UL/b' region of the HCMV genome at early times 
postinfection and is a TNFR1-like homologue. Despite this homology to the TNFR1
receptor superfamily, UL144 does not bind to members of the TNF ligand
superfamily. We show here that the upregulation of NF-kappaB by UL144 is
dependent upon cellular tripartite motif 23 (TRIM23) protein. We propose a
mechanism by which UL144 activates NF-kappaB through a direct interaction with
the cellular protein TRIM23 in a complex containing TRAF6. In contrast, TRIM23 is
not involved in conventional double-stranded RNA signaling via NF-kappaB.
Therefore, we present a novel role for TRIM23 that is specific to UL144-mediated 
activation of NF-kappaB during the course of virus infection.
