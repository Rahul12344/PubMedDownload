The adenovirus E1A C-terminal region restrains oncogenic transformation through
interaction with three distinct cellular protein complexes that include the
DYRK1A/1B/HAN11 complex. The E6 proteins of beta-human papillomaviruses
(beta-HPVs) also interact with the DYRK1/HAN11 complex. A variant of HPV5 E6
frequently found in epidermodysplasia verruciformis skin lesions interacted less 
efficiently with DYRK1A/HAN11. The E6 variant and E7 of HPV5 efficiently
coimmortalized primary epithelial cells, suggesting that naturally arising
variants may contribute potential oncogenic activities of beta-HPV E6 proteins.
