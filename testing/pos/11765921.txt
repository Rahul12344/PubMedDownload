In order to clarify the biological role of US2 gene product of herpes simplex
virus type 2 (HSV-2), a HeLa cDNA library was screened in the yeast two-hybrid
system using US2 protein as bait, and several interacting proteins were
identified, including cytokeratin 18. US2 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with 
cytokeratin 18 from HSV-2 infected cell lysates. Analysis of infected orA431
cells by immunofluorescence showed that US2 protein gave filamentous or dot-like 
cytoplasmic staining pattern, and that it co-localized with cytokeratin 18. When 
US2 protein was expressed alone, it co-localized with cytokeratin 18. To define
the domain interacting with cytokeratin 18, deletion mutant proteins were
constructed and cells transfected with mutants were analyzed by indirect
immunofluorescence. These results suggest that the N-terminal half of the US2
protein, especially the region containing amino acids 42-77, is important for
interaction with cytokeratin 18.
