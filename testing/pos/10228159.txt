E7 is the main transforming protein of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16)
which is implicated in the formation of cervical cancer. The transforming
activity of E7 has been attributed to its interaction with the retinoblastoma
(Rb) tumour suppressor. However, Rb binding is not sufficient for transformation 
by E7. Mutations within a zinc finger domain, which is dispensable for Rb
binding, also abolish E7 transformation functions. Here we show that HPV16 E7
associates with histone deacetylase in vitro and in vivo, via its zinc finger
domain. Using a genetic screen, we identify Mi2beta, a component of the recently 
identified NURD histone deacetylase complex, as a protein that binds directly to 
the E7 zinc finger. A zinc finger point mutant which is unable to bind Mi2beta
and histone deacetylase but is still able to bind Rb fails to overcome cell cycle
arrest in osteosarcoma cells. Our results suggest that the binding to a histone
deacetylase complex is an important parameter for the growthpromoting activity of
the human papilloma virus E7 protein. This provides the first indication that
viral oncoproteins control cell proliferation by targeting deacetylation
pathways.
