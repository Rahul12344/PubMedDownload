The neuronal damage characteristic of HIV-1-mediated CNS diseases is inflicted by
HIV-1 infected brain macrophages. Several steps of viral replication, including
assembly and budding, differ between macrophages and T cells; it is likely that
cell-specific host factors mediate these differences. We previously defined
Annexin 2 (Anx2) as an HIV Gag binding partner in human monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDMs) that promotes proper viral assembly. Anx2, a calcium-dependent
membrane-binding protein that can aggregate phospholipid-containing lipid rafts, 
is expressed to high levels in macrophages, but not in T lymphocytes or the 293T 
cell line. Here, we use bimolecular fluorescence complementation in the 293T cell
model to demonstrate that Anx2 and HIV-1 Gag interact at the phosphatidylinositol
(4,5) bisphosphate-containing lipid raft membrane domains at which Gag mediates
viral assembly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Anx2 expression in 293T cells
increases Gag processing and HIV-1 production. These data provide new evidence
that Anx2, by interacting with Gag at the membranes that support viral assembly, 
functions in the late stages of HIV-1 replication.
