OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of anti-rubella virus antibodies and the
level of knowledge about congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) among pregnant women
living in southern Italy.
METHODS: A seroepidemiologic study was conducted between July 1, 2006, and
December 31, 2007. Five-hundred women resident in Messina were enrolled in the
study; the participants were in the 4th to 39th week of pregnancy. Anti-rubella
virus antibodies were assayed using a microparticle enzyme immunoassay.
Demographic details, vaccination history, and participants' knowledge of the
potential risks of rubella infection during pregnancy were assessed via
questionnaire.
RESULTS: On the basis of the questionnaire results, 70.4% of women were classed
as immune to rubella virus infection; however, the prevalence of IgG anti-rubella
virus antibodies measured in the participants' serum was 85.8%. Although 55.2% of
women had undergone pre-pregnancy rubella screening, only 81 participants
reported that they had been vaccinated before becoming pregnant. The
participants' general knowledge about CRS was poor, as was their understanding of
the importance of undergoing screening.
CONCLUSION: The number of women at risk of rubella infection fell short of the
national target set for elimination of CRS. Increased involvement and
collaboration by all healthcare workers are, therefore, required to disseminate
the information necessary to prevent CRS.
