BACKGROUND: Several reports indicated that non-thermal electromagnetic radiation 
such as from mobile phones and base stations may promote cancer. Therefore, it
was investigated experimentally, whether 900 MHz electromagnetic field exposure
influences lymphoma development in a mouse strain that is genetically predisposed
to this disease. The AKR/J mice genome carries the AK-virus, which leads within
one year to spontaneous development of thymic lymphoblastic lymphoma.
METHODS: 320 unrestrained female mice were sham-exposed or exposed (each n = 160 
animals) to GSM like 900 MHz electromagnetic fields for 24 hours per day, 7 days 
per week, at an average whole body specific absorption rate (SAR) value of 0.4
W/kg. Animals were visually checked daily and were weighed and palpated weekly.
Starting with an age of 6 months, blood samples were taken monthly from the tail.
Animals with signs of disease or with an age of about 46 weeks were sacrificed
and a gross necropsy was performed.
RESULTS: Electromagnetic field exposure had a significant effect on body weight
gain, with higher values in exposed than in sham-exposed animals. However,
survival rate and lymphoma incidence did not differ between exposed and
sham-exposed mice.
CONCLUSION: These data do not support the hypothesis that exposure to 900 MHz
electromagnetic fields is a significant risk factor for developing lymphoma in a 
genetically predisposed species, even at a relatively high exposure level.
