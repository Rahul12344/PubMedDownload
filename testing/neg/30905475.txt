Contractile injection systems (CISs) are cell-puncturing nanodevices that share
ancestry with contractile tail bacteriophages. Photorhabdus virulence cassette
(PVC) represents one group of extracellular CISs that are present in both
bacteria and archaea. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of an intact PVC from
P. asymbiotica. This over 10-MDa device resembles a simplified T4 phage tail,
containing a hexagonal baseplate complex with six fibers and a capped
117-nanometer sheath-tube trunk. One distinct feature of the PVC is the presence 
of three variants for both tube and sheath proteins, indicating a functional
specialization of them during evolution. The terminal hexameric cap docks onto
the topmost layer of the inner tube and locks the outer sheath in pre-contraction
state with six stretching arms. Our results on the PVC provide a framework for
understanding the general mechanism of widespread CISs and pave the way for using
them as delivery tools in biological or therapeutic applications.
