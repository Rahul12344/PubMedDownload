A virus-associated hemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS) is a non-neoplastic,
generalized histiocytic proliferation with prominent hemophagocytosis associated 
with a systemic viral infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is one candidate for
this association but serologic and molecular biologic studies have been lacking
in many cases. Although VAHS is generally a benign process, EBV-associated
hemophagocytic syndrome (EBV-AHS) is often fatal and has a relatively high
mortality rate. Therefore, EBV-AHS must be distinguished from VAHS caused by
other viruses. Recent evidence indicates that the pathophysiology in EBV-AHS
appears to be mediated by the unrestricted release of cytokines produced by the
EBV-infected T cells. Clinical and laboratory findings, the differential
diagnosis, virology studies, pathophysiology, and treatment in EBV-AHS are
reviewed.
