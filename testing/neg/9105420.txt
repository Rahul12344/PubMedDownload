Co-infection with virus and bacteria happens frequently and often results in an
exacerbated clinical course of the disease, possibly due to mechanisms including 
altered cytokine production. In the present study, the authors investigated the
combined effects of avirulent Semliki Forest virus (SFV-A7) and bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-2 gene
expression in murine splenic cells. The authors found that 10 ng/ml of LPS in the
culture medium induced expression of IL-1 beta but not IL-2, while infection with
SFV-A7 did not induce either of these two cytokines. However, when SFV-A7 and LPS
were applied together, a synergistic increase of both IL-1 beta and IL-2 was
observed. Further experiments showed that addition of SFV-A7 3 h before LPS
enhanced, whereas addition of the virus 3 h after the LPS inhibited, IL-1 beta
gene expression. These results indicate that an interaction of virus and
Gram-negative bacteria can result in an altered cytokine gene expression.
