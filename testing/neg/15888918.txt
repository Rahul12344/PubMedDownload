We report three patients who developed hypopituitarism as a late complication of 
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Their past history, physical
examination, and endocrine investigation confirmed hypopituitarism. Magnetic
resonance imaging of the pituitary revealed atrophic pituitary gland with an
empty sella. Hemorrhagic fever is endemic in certain regions of the Balkans, and 
this preliminary report suggests the importance of investigating the endocrine
status in every patient who survived HFRS.
