Minimal food-processing methods are not effective against foodborne viruses, such
as human norovirus (NV). It is important, therefore, to explore novel nonthermal 
technologies for decontamination of foods eaten fresh, minimally processed and
ready-to-eat foods, and food contact surfaces. We studied the in vitro virucidal 
activity of cold atmospheric gaseous plasma (CGP) against feline calicivirus
(FCV), a surrogate of NV. Factors affecting the virucidal activity of CGP (a
so-called radio frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet) were the plasma
generation power, the exposure time and distance, the plasma feed gas mixture,
and the virus suspension medium. Exposure to 2.5-W argon (Ar) plasma caused a
5.55 log10 unit reduction in the FCV titer within 120 s. The reduction in the
virus titer increased with increasing exposure time and decreasing exposure
distance. Of the four plasma gas mixtures studied (Ar, Ar plus 1% O2, Ar plus 1% 
dry air, and Ar plus 0.27% water), Ar plus 1% O2 plasma treatment had the highest
virucidal effect: more than 6.0 log10 units of the virus after 15 s of exposure. 
The lowest virus reduction was observed with Ar plus 0.27% water plasma treatment
(5 log10 unit reduction after 120 s). The highest reduction in titer was observed
when the virus was suspended in distilled water. Changes in temperature and pH
and formation of H2O2 were not responsible for the virucidal effect of plasma.
The oxidation of viral capsid proteins by plasma-produced reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species in the solution was thought to be responsible for the virucidal 
effect. In conclusion, CGP exhibits virucidal activity in vitro and has the
potential to combat viral contamination in foods and on food preparation
surfaces.
