BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thrombomodulin (TM), through its lectin-like domain (TMD1), 
sequesters proinflammatory high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) to prevent it from
engaging the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) that sustains
inflammation and tissue damage. Our previous study demonstrated that short-term
treatment with recombinant TM containing all the extracellular domains (i.e.,
rTMD123) inhibits HMGB1-RAGE signaling and confers protection against
CaCl2-induced AAA formation. In this study, we attempted to further optimize TM
domains, as a potential therapeutic agent for AAA, using the recombinant
adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector.
METHODS: The therapeutic effects of recombinant TMD1 (rTMD1) and recombinant AAV 
vectors carrying the lectin-like domain of TM (rAAV-TMD1) were evaluated in the
CaCl2-induced AAA model and angiotensin II-infused AAA model, respectively.
RESULTS: In the CaCl2-induced model, treatment with rTMD1 suppressed the tissue
levels of HMGB1 and RAGE, macrophage accumulation, elastin destruction and AAA
formation, and the effects were comparable to a mole-equivalent dosage of
rTMD123. In the angiotensin II-infused model, a single intravenous injection of
rAAV-TMD1 (1011 genome copies), which resulted in a persistently high serum level
of TMD1 for at least 12 weeks, effectively attenuated AAA formation with
suppression of HMGB1 and RAGE levels and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine
production, macrophage accumulation, matrix metalloproteinase activities and
oxidative stress in the aortic wall.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings corroborate the therapeutic potential of the TM
lectin-like domain in AAA. The attenuation of angiotensin II-infused AAA by
one-time delivery of rAAV-TMD1 provides a proof-of-concept validation of its
application as potential gene therapy for aneurysm development.
