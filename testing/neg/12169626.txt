CTXphi is a filamentous bacteriophage whose genome encodes cholera toxin, the
principal virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae. We have found that the
CTXphi-related element RS1 is a satellite phage whose transmission depends upon
proteins produced from a CTX prophage (its helper phage). However, unlike other
satellite phages and satellite animal viruses, RS1 can aid the CTX prophage as
well as exploit it, due to the RS1-encoded protein RstC. RstC, whose function
previously was unknown, is an antirepressor that counteracts the activity of the 
phage repressor RstR. RstC promotes transcription of genes required for phage
production and thereby promotes transmission of both RS1 and CTXphi.
Antirepression by RstC also induces expression of the cholera toxin genes, ctxAB,
and thus may contribute to the virulence of V.cholerae. In vitro, RstC binds
directly to RstR, producing unusual, insoluble aggregates containing both
proteins. In vivo, RstC and RstR are both found at the cell pole, where they
again appear to form stable complexes. The sequestration/inactivation process
induced by RstC resembles those induced by mutant polyglutamine-containing
proteins implicated in human neurodegenerative disorders.
