Persistent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are responsible for
significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. One
mechanism by which HCMV may develop persistence after primary infection is
through inhibition of host cell human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II expression
with resultant escape from normal antiviral immune surveillance.
Immunofluorescence flow cytometry of human endothelial cell (EC) cultures
infected with HCMV AD169 and an EC propagated strain, VHL/E, showed a marked
reduction in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced surface expression of HLA-DR.
This inhibition did not occur when EC were treated with ultraviolet-inactivated
virus and IFN-gamma. HCMV, as determined by dual-labeling immunohistochemistry,
inhibited induction of surface and cytoplasmic class II antigens specifically in 
infected cells. HCMV infection also inhibited IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha up-regulation of HLA class I expression. Northern blot analysis of
infected, IFN-gamma-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed an
absence of class II mRNA. Persistence of HCMV may result in part from its ability
to inhibit HLA class II induction in infected cells.
