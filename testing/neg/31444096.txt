Shared pens and styluses are a potential source for transmission of health
care-associated pathogens and respiratory viruses in health care facilities. A
novel ultraviolet light-emitting diode device was effective in reducing bacteria 
and viruses inoculated on pens and in reducing methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus transferred to pens by colonized patients. The device could
be useful in reducing the risk of transmission of pathogens by shared writing
utensils.
