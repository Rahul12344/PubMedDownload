Patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and cirrhosis are
underrepresented in clinical trials of interferon-free regimens of direct-acting 
antiviral agents, making it difficult to optimize therapy. We performed a
post-hoc analysis of data from seven clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of the fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF),
with and without ribavirin (RBV), in 513 treatment-naïve and previously treated
patients with genotype 1 HCV and compensated cirrhosis. All patients received
LDV-SOF for 12 or 24 weeks with or without RBV. We determined the rates of
sustained virological response (SVR) 12 weeks after treatment (SVR12) overall and
for subgroups. Of the 513 patients analyzed, 69% were previously treated and 47% 
had failed previous treatment with a protease-inhibitor regimen. Overall, 493
patients (96%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 94%-98%) achieved SVR12, 98% of
treatment-naïve and 95% of previously treated patients. SVR12 rates did not vary 
greatly by treatment duration (95% of patients receiving 12 weeks and 98% of
patients receiving 24 weeks of treatment), nor by addition of RBV (95% of
patients receiving LDV-SOF alone and 97% of those who received LDV-SOF plus RBV),
although previously treated patients receiving 12 weeks of LDV-SOF without RBV
had an SVR12 rate of 90%. One patient discontinued LDV-SOF because of an adverse 
event (AE). The most common AEs were headache (23%), fatigue (16%-19%), and
asthenia (14%-16%). One patient (<1%) of those receiving LDV-SOF alone, and 4
(2%) of those receiving LDV-SOF plus RBV had treatment-related serious
AEs.CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that 12 weeks of LDV-SOF is safe and
effective for treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1 and compensated
cirrhosis. The relatively lower SVR in treatment-experienced patients treated
with 12 weeks of LDV-SOF raises the question of whether these patients would
benefit from adding RBV or extending treatment duration to 24 weeks.
