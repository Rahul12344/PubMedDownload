The ribosomal protein L22 is a component of the 60S eukaryotic ribosomal subunit.
As an RNA-binding protein, it has been shown to interact with both cellular and
viral RNAs including 28S rRNA and the Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA, EBER-1. L22
is localized to the cell nucleus where it accumulates in nucleoli. Although
previous studies demonstrated that a specific amino acid sequence is required for
nucleolar localization, the RNA-binding domain has not been identified. Here, we 
investigated the hypothesis that the nucleolar accumulation of L22 is linked to
its ability to bind RNA. To address this hypothesis, mutated L22 proteins were
generated to assess the contribution of specific amino acids to RNA binding and
protein localization. Using RNA-protein binding assays, we demonstrate that basic
amino acids 80-93 are required for high affinity binding of 28S rRNA and EBER-1
by L22. Fluorescence localization studies using GFP-tagged mutated L22 proteins
further reveal that basic amino acids 80-93 are critical for nucleolar
accumulation and for incorporation into ribosomes. Our data support the growing
consensus that the nucleolar accumulation of ribosomal proteins may not be
mediated by a defined localization signal, but rather by specific interaction
with established nucleolar components such as rRNA.
