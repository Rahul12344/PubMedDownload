BACKGROUND: Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) is one of the main infectious
causative agents of abortion in mares and can also be associated with stillbirth,
neonatal foal death, rhinopneumonitis in young horses and a neurological disorder
called equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The neuropathogenicity of
the virus was shown to be significantly higher in EHV-1 strains that carry a
single nucleotide point (SNP) mutation in the ORF30, which encodes a catalytic
subunit of viral DNA polymerase (ORF30 D752). Another gene, ORF68 is frequently
used for phylogenetic analysis of EHV-1.
METHODS: 27 EHV-1 strains isolated from aborted equine fetuses in Poland,
collected between 1993 and 2017, were subjected to PCR targeting the open reading
frames (ORFs) 30 and 68 of the EHV-1 genome. PCR products obtained were sequenced
and SNPs were analyzed and compared to sequences available in GenBank.
RESULTS: None of the analyzed sequences belonged to the ORF30 D752neuropathogenic
genotype: all EHV-1 belonged to the non-neuropathogenic variant N752. On the
basis of ORF68 sequences, the majority of EHV-1 sequences (76.9%) cannot be
assigned to any of the known groups; only six sequences (23.1%) clustered within 
groups II and IV.
CONCLUSIONS: EHV-1 strains obtained from abortion cases belong to the
non-neuropathogenic genotype. Many EHV-1 ORF68 sequences have similar SNPs to
those already described in Poland, but a clear geographical distribution was not 
observed. A single particular ORF68 sequence type was observed in strains
isolated from 2001 onwards.
