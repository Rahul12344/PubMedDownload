Stilbenoids including resveratrol contain the basic structural unit of
1,2-diphenylethylene. Naturally occurring stilbenoids have broad structural
features due to oligomerization and modifications and some have demonstrated
potent biological activities. In an effort to identify bioactive stilbenoids, we 
screened a group of dimeric and oligomeric stilbenoids against HSV-1 and HSV-2
infection. Several trimeric and tetrameric derivatives showed anti-herpetic
activity at single digit micromolar concentrations. HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication
requires for NF-κB and MAPK activation. The compounds showed no inhibitory
activity against NF-κB and Erk/MAPK activation, instead those compounds promoted 
rapid and transient release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Addition of
N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a scavenger of ROS, reversed the inhibitory effect of
those compounds against HSV replication. In addition to the identification of
resveratrol derivatives with potent anti-HSV activity, our results uncover a
mechanism of polyphenol-mediated anti-HSV response, linking anti-herpetic
activity of oligomeric stilbenoids to innate immunity.
