Progress toward the development of universal influenza vaccines.

Hoft DF, Belshe RB.

Influenza remains a major problem causing significant morbidity and mortality
annually and periodic pandemics with the potential for 10-100 fold increased
mortality. Conventional vaccines can be highly effective if generated each year
to match currently circulating viruses. Ongoing research focuses on producing
cross-protective vaccines that induce T cell and/ or antibody responses specific 
for highly conserved viral epitopes. The Saint Louis University Center for
Vaccine Development (SLUCVD) is highly engaged in multiple efforts to generate
universally relevant influenza vaccines.
