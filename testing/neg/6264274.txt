Isolation and mapping of Escherichia coli K12 mutants defective in Tn9
transposition.

Ilyina TS, Nechaeva EV, Romanova YuM, Smirnov GB.

Five mutants (called tnm) of Escherichia coli with impaired ability for
transposition of Tn9 were isolated after treatment with ethyl methanesulfonate
(EMS) or N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NG). The map locations of the tnm 
mutations were determined by a combination of Hfr matings, F' episome
complementation and P1 transductional mapping. The data obtained show that the
five tnm mutations are located near 91 min on the Escherichia coli linkage map
and are cotransducible with the metA marker with a frequency of 3%-4%.
Introduction of F' plasmids containing this region complements the Tnm- phenotype
for the two mutants tested i.e. tnm-1 and tnm-2 are recessive in tnm+/tnm-
merodiploids.
