We studied the seroprevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
and GB virus-C (GBV-C) infections in 348 Siberian natives who lived in the
Kamchatka Peninsula of Russia. Of 348 samples studied, the seroprevalence of
HBsAg and anti-HBs were 11.8% (41 of 348 samples) and 35.9% (125 of 348 samples),
respectively. The prevalence of HCV infection was 1.4% (5 of 348 samples), and
that of GBV-C RNA, using RT-PCR methods, was 7.5% (26 of 348 samples). In
Siberia, the prevalences of HBV and GBV-C infections were about tenfold higher
than those in Japan. The prevalence of HBsAg in subjects under 50 years of age
was significantly higher than that in those over 50 years old (P < 0.05). Because
HBV infection is highly endemic in Siberia, we propose that the community-based
mass immunization must be conducted as soon as possible in this area.
