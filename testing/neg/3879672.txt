Relevance of studies of cellular receptors to the prevention and control of viral
disease: memorandum from a WHO meeting.

[No authors listed]

This Memorandum describes recent scientific advances in the identification and
characterization of cell receptors for viruses and their relevance to programmes 
for the prevention and control of viral diseases. These areas of anti-viral
research provide an improved understanding of the mechanisms of viral
pathogenesis and a rational basis for the development of anti-viral drugs, viral 
vaccines, and new diagnostic approaches and reagents. Advances in research to
characterize the cellular receptors for human picornaviruses (including
poliovirus, coxsackievirus and rhinovirus), influenza viruses, and reoviruses are
reviewed.
