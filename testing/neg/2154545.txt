A seroepidemiological survey of prevalence of antibodies to poliovirus types 1-3 
was carried out in 1,800 residents of 30 agricultural settlements (kibbutzim) in 
Israel during 1980 and 1981. The survey showed that in 1980 84%, 90%, and 79% of 
the kibbutz residents exhibited antibodies to poliovirus types 1-3, respectively.
In 1981 the figures were 81%, 91%, and 73%. Significantly lower levels of
antibodies for poliovirus type 3 in 1980/1981, and for poliovirus type 1 in 1981,
were noticed in the age group 6-17 years compared with the age group of greater
than 18 years. Infants and young children of the kibbutzim received the Salk
polio vaccine during 1957-1961 and the Sabin oral polio vaccine since 1961. Among
overseas volunteers from Western countries who came during 1980 and 1981 to work 
in the kibbutzim for a limited period of time, 88% exhibited antibodies to
poliovirus type 1, 94% to poliovirus type 2, and 75% to poliovirus type 3. No
significant differences in the level of antibodies were detected between males
and females or between residents in those kibbutzim using or not using wastewater
for irrigation.
