OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of infection with non-vaccinable high risk 
genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV).
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
LOCATION: Seven randomly selected health centres in Cantabria (Northern Spain).
PARTICIPANTS: All women with an evaluable vaginal smear (n=3,359) between 2010
and 2011.
MAIN MEASURES: The variables collected were cytological diagnosis, PCR results,
and family planning method. The vaginal smear results were classified with the
Bethesda system. The classification by Muñoz et al. was used for typing as
oncogenic risk HPV. Proportions and odds ratio (OR) were estimated with
corresponding confidence intervals at 95% (95% CI).
RESULTS: The prevalence of HPV infection was 2.71% (95% CI: 2.15 to 3.27). The
prevalence of high oncogenic risk HPV genotypes was 2.26%; (95% CI: 1.75 to
2.78). The most frequent genotype was 16 (28.89%). More than half of the women
were positive for one of the non-vaccinable high risk genotypes: 51 (18.89%) and 
58 (13.33%) and 68 (12.22%) or 31 (11.11%). At least two non-vaccinable high-risk
genotypes co-existed in 23.33% of women. Younger women (≤30 years) had twice the 
risk of any HPV infection: OR 2.01 (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.96); and were twice as
likely to use condoms compared to hormonal contraceptives, OR 2.09 (95% CI: 1.64 
to 2.67).
CONCLUSIONS: According to the high percentage of non-vaccinable high oncogenic
risk HPV types, there should be a re-think of the prevention strategy in the
population, who may have a false sense of protection.
