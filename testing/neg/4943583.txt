Rapid identification of viruses by indirect immunofluorescence: isolation and
identification of adenovirus types 4 and 7 and coxsackievirus type A21 in
microcultures.

Stevens TD, Watkins HM.

The indirect fluorescent-antibody test (IFAT), employing treated and standardized
antiserum in a single pool, was earlier reported to have been used successfully
for the preliminary identification of nine respiratory viruses in second to ninth
passage multiplying in cells propagated on microscope slides. This report
describes parameters affecting the isolation in first passage and the
identification by IFAT of adenovirus types 4 and 7 and coxsackievirus type A21
present in stored clinical specimens inoculated into microcultures of WI-38
cells. Isolation frequency was comparable to that obtained in tube cultures, and 
identification by IFAT of viruses in microcultures could be accomplished in 3 to 
4 hr after recognition of a cytopathogenic effect.
