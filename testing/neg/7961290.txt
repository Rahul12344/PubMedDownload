In situ hybridization is a molecular technique that can be useful in the study of
hematologic malignancies. Thus far, the most extensive uses have been in the
detection of viral sequences and in the detection of chromosomal alterations.
Other applications such as the identification of various cellular gene products
are more limited, but with improvements in the sensitivity and reliability of
methods for ISH, their use will become more widespread. Information provided by
ISH contributes to our understanding of the pathophysiology and etiology of
hematologic malignancies. In the future, ISH may be used routinely in the
evaluation of leukemias and lymphomas.
