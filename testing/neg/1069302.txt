Superstructure of linear duplex DNA.

Vollenweider HJ, Koller T, Parello J, Sogo JM.

The superstructure of a covalently closed circular DNA (of bacteriophage PM 2)
was compared by electron microscopy with that of a linear duplex DNA (of
bacteriophage T7) when ionic strength and benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride
concentration were varied. In parallel studies the sedimentation behavior of
these DNAs was studied by analytical ultracentrifugation, but for technical
reasons these had to be without benzyldimethylalkylammonium chloride. By
combining the information from the two methods one has to conclude that with
increasing ionic strength the linear duplex T7 DNA spontaneously forms a
structure similar to that of the superhelical structure of closed circular PM 2
DNA. The superstructure is destroyed under premelting conditions and in the
presence of an excess of ethidium bromide.
