Continued monitoring of the seriousness of influenza viruses is a public health
priority. We applied time-series regression models to data on cardio-respiratory 
mortality rates in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2011. We used surveillance data on
outpatient consultations for influenza-like illness, and laboratory detections of
influenza types/subtypes to construct proxy measures of influenza activity. In
the model we allowed the regression coefficients for influenza to drift over
time, and adjusted for temperature and humidity. The regression coefficient for
influenza A(H3N2) increased significantly in 2005. The regression coefficients
for influenza A(H1N1) and B were relatively stable over the period. Our model
suggested an increase in seriousness of A(H3N2) in 2005, the year after the
appearance of the A/Fujian/411/2002(H3N2)-like virus when the drifted
A/California/7/2004(H3N2)-like virus appeared. Ongoing monitoring of mortality
and influenza activity could permit identification of future changes in
seriousness of influenza virus infections.
