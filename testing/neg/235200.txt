Ribonuclease-resistant RNA of Kemerovo virus.

Rosenbergová M, Slávik I.

RNA of partially purified Kemerovo virus sedimented in a relatively broad region 
in sucrose density gradient with a peak at 14 S. Approximately 65% of this RNA
was resistant to the action of ribonuclease which indicates the double-stranded
nature of Kemerovo virus RNA.
