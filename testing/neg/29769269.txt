The innate immunity is critically important in protection against virus
infections, and in the case of RNA viral infections, the signaling mechanisms
that initiate robust protective innate immunity without triggering autoimmune
inflammation remain incompletely defined. In this study, we found the E3 ligase
TRIM29 was specifically expressed in poly I:C-stimulated human myeloid dendritic 
cells. The induced TRIM29 played a negative role in type I IFN production in
response to poly I:C or dsRNA virus reovirus infection. Importantly, the
challenge of wild-type mice with reovirus led to lethal infection. In contrast,
deletion of TRIM29 protected the mice from this developing lethality.
Additionally, TRIM29-/- mice have lower titers of reovirus in the heart,
intestine, spleen, liver, and brain because of elevated production of type I IFN.
Mechanistically, TRIM29 was shown to interact with MAVS and subsequently induce
its K11-linked ubiquitination and degradation. Taken together, TRIM29 regulates
negatively the host innate immune response to RNA virus, which could be employed 
by RNA viruses for viral pathogenesis.
