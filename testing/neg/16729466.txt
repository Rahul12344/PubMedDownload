In this study serological investigations were performed to determine the
prevalence of pestiviral infections in sheep in one Federal State of Austria,
namely Carinthia. 1527 blood samples from sheep in 147 flocks were collected and 
tested by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and virus-neutralisation tests for
antibodies to ruminant pestiviruses. The estimated flock prevalence was 47.6%,
the individual prevalence 16.3%. Significant geographical variations in the flock
as well in the individual prevalence were found. The highest prevalence in sheep 
and in sheep flocks was established in the region Spittal/Drau with 25.9% and
69.7%.The individual and the flock prevalence was significantly higher on farms
where cattle or sheep from other farms were present than on farms with no cattle 
(p < 0.017). All Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positive sera were tested for 
Bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (strain NADL), Bovine viral diarrhea virus-2
(strain 125) and for Border disease virus (strain MOREDUN) by virus
neutralisation tests. Seventy out of 249 positive samples revealed the highest
titres (> or = two-fold) to Bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 and 25 to Border
disease virus. The remaining positive samples did not show clear results because 
of cross reactions.
