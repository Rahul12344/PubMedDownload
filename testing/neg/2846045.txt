vivo.

The ability of Escherichia coli Nus A protein to recognize specific DNA or RNA
sequences in vitro was tested by using transcription templates containing a
variety of promoters, transcription terminators, and antitermination-conferring
regions. We conclude that the effects of Nus A on termination are not
qualitatively or quantitatively altered by sequences present in promoters,
Rho-dependent terminators, or antitermination-conferring regions. Nus A was also 
shown to increase termination at the rrnC Rho-independent T1 terminator by a
mechanism that is independent of the promoter or sequences involved in
antitermination. Altogether, these observations argue against a direct Nus
A-nucleic acid interaction affecting termination in vitro. Together with the
results described in the accompanying paper [Sigmund, C. D., & Morgan, E. A.
(1988) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue)], these results suggest that 
the effects of Nus A on termination in vitro may not be related to the in vivo
functions of Nus A.
