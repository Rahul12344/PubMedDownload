Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) represents one of the most important innate immunity
responses in a host to combat infections of many human viruses including human
herpesviruses. Human N-myc interactor (Nmi) protein, which has been shown to
interact with signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins
including STAT1, is important for the activation of IFN-γ induced STAT1-dependent
transcription of many genes responsible for IFN-γ immune responses. However, no
proteins encoded by herpesviruses have been reported to interact with Nmi and
inhibit Nmi-mediated activation of IFN-γ immune responses to achieve immune
evasion from IFN-γ responses. In this study, we show strong evidence that the
UL23 protein of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), a human herpesvirus, specifically
interacts with Nmi. This interaction was identified through a yeast two-hybrid
screen and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells. We observed that Nmi, when
bound to UL23, was not associated with STAT1, suggesting that UL23 binding of Nmi
disrupts the interaction of Nmi with STAT1. In cells overexpressing UL23, we
observed (a) significantly reduced levels of Nmi and STAT1 in the nuclei, the
sites where these proteins act to induce transcription of IFN-γ stimulated genes,
and (b) decreased levels of the induction of the transcription of IFN-γ
stimulated genes. UL23-deficient HCMV mutants induced higher transcription of
IFN-γ stimulated genes and exhibited lower titers than parental and control
revertant viruses expressing functional UL23 in IFN-γ treated cells. Thus, UL23
appears to interact directly with Nmi and inhibit nuclear translocation of Nmi
and its associated protein STAT1, leading to a decrease of IFN-γ induced
responses and an increase of viral resistance to IFN-γ. Our results further
highlight the roles of UL23-Nmi interactions in facilitating viral immune escape 
from IFN-γ responses and enhancing viral resistance to IFN antiviral effects.
