Tissue homeostasis requires balancing cell proliferation and programmed cell
death. IGF1 significantly suppressed etoposide-induced apoptosis, measured by
caspase 3 activation and quantitation of cellular subG(1) DNA content, in rat
parotid salivary acinar cells (C5). Transduction of C5 cells with an adenovirus
expressing a constitutively activated mutant of Akt-suppressed etoposide-induced 
apoptosis, whereas a kinase-inactive mutant of Akt suppressed the protective
effect of IGF1. IGF1 also suppressed apoptosis induced by taxol and brefeldin A. 
EGF was unable to suppress apoptosis induced by etoposide, but was able to
synergize with IGF1 to further suppress caspase 3 activation and DNA cleavage
after etoposide treatment. The catalytic activity of Akt was significantly higher
following stimulation with both growth factors compared to stimulation with IGF1 
or EGF alone. These results suggest that a threshold of activated Akt is required
for suppression of apoptosis and the cooperative action of growth factors in
regulating salivary gland homeostasis.
