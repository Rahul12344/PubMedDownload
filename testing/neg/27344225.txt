The explosive Zika virus epidemic in the Americas is amplifying spread of this
emerging pathogen into previously unaffected regions of the world, including
Europe (Gulland, 2016), where local populations are immunologically naïve. As
summertime approaches in the northern hemisphere, Aedes mosquitoes in Europe may 
find suitable climatic conditions to acquire and subsequently transmit Zika virus
from viremic travellers to local populations. While Aedes albopictus has proven
to be a vector for the transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses in Europe
(Delisle et al., 2015; ECDC, n.d.) there is growing experimental and ecological
evidence to suggest that it may also be competent for Zika virus(Chouin-Carneiro 
et al., 2016; Grard et al., 2014; Li et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2013). Here we
analyze and overlay the monthly flows of airline travellers arriving into
European cities from Zika affected areas across the Americas, the predicted
monthly estimates of the basic reproduction number of Zika virus in areas where
Aedes mosquito populations reside in Europe (Aedes aegypti in Madeira, Portugal
and Ae. albopictus in continental Europe), and human populations living within
areas where mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus may be possible. We
highlight specific geographic areas and timing of risk for Zika virus
introduction and possible spread within Europe to inform the efficient use of
human disease surveillance, vector surveillance and control, and public education
resources.
