Characterization of cross-reacting antigens on the Epstein-Barr virus envelope
and plasma membranes of producer cells.

Thorley-Lawson DA.

A rabbit antiserum has been prepared against the B95-8 transforming strain of
EBV. The antiserum has a high virus neutralizing titer (approximately 1:1000)
against both the marmoset B95-8 EBV and the human P3HR-1 EBV. The neutralizing
antibodies may be absorbed completely with EBV producer cell lines, but not with 
nonproducer cell lines or producer cell lines treated with phosphonoacetic acid
(PAA) so as to be nonproducer. After repeated absorption with PAA-treated B95-8, 
the serum remains reactive with the membranes of producer cell lines as judged by
immunofluorescence or the 125I--Staphylococcal protein A radioimmunoassay. Thus
the neutralizing antigens are expressed on the membranes of producer cell lines
and may be purified from this source using the serum and 125I--Staph A binding as
an assay. The ability of the serum to differentiate between producer and
nonproducer cells by means of cell surface determinants has been exploited to
achieve a separation of these two populations from the same culture.
Immunoprecipitation by the protein A technique shows that the serum recognizes
two polypeptides from producer cells of approximate molecular weights 150,000 and
75,000.
