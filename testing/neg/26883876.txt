Natural killer (NK) cells are the primary effectors of the innate immune response
against virus-infected cells or cells that have undergone malignant
transformation. NK cells recognize their targets through a complex array of
activating and inhibitory receptors, which regulate the intensity of the effector
response against individual target cells. However, many studies have shown that
tumor cells can escape immune cell recognition through a variety of mechanisms,
developing resistance to NK cell killing. Using a lentiviral shRNA library, we
previously demonstrated that several common signaling pathways modulate
susceptibility of tumor cells to NK cell activity. In this study, we focused on
one of the genes (PI3KCB), identified in this genetic screen. The PI3KCB gene
encodes an isoform of the catalytic subunit of PI3K called P110β. The PI3K
pathway has been linked to diverse cellular functions, but has never been
associated with susceptibility to NK cell activity. Gene silencing of PI3KCB
resulted in increased susceptibility of several tumor cell lines to NK cell lytic
activity and induced increased IFN-γ secretion by NK cells. Treatment of primary 
tumor cells with two different PI3K inhibitors also increased target cell
susceptibility to NK cell activity. These effects are due, at least in part, to
modulation of several activating and inhibitory ligands and appear to be
correlated with PI3K signaling pathway inhibition. These findings identify a new 
and important role of PI3KCB in modulating tumor cell susceptibility to NK cells 
and open the way to future combined target immunotherapies.
