Investigation of the traditional uses of Momordica charantia (Cucurbitaceae) in
Togo (West Africa) showed that it is one of the most important local medicinal
plants both for ritual and ethnomedical practices. There was a high degree of
consensus (>50%) for use in the treatment of gastrointestinal and viral disease
among 47 groups of village informants in the general population, while 19
traditional healers reported a larger and broader set of uses. The use by
informants in Gaur and Kwa language groups was not significantly different.
Lyophilized Momordica charantia extracts prepared from accessions collected in
Togo showed high antiviral activity (<5 microg/ml) against Sindbis and Herpes
simplex type 1 viruses and anthelmintic activity against Caenorhabditis elegans
at 500 microg/ml. Presence in the leaves of the triterpene glycosides momordicins
I and II follows biological activity of the plant extracts. However, momordicins 
were found to be anthelmintic but not antiviral. Traditional healers collected
plants in dry areas where momordicin content is greater.
