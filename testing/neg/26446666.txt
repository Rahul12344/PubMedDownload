Post-transcriptional modification of viral mRNA is essential for the translation 
of viral proteins by cellular translation machinery. Due to the cytoplasmic
replication of Paramyxoviruses, the viral-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP) is thought to possess all activities required for mRNA capping and
methylation. In the present work, using partially purified recombinant RNA
polymerase complex of rinderpest virus expressed in insect cells, we demonstrate 
the in vitro methylation of capped mRNA. Further, we show that a recombinant
C-terminal fragment (1717-2183 aa) of L protein is capable of methylating capped 
mRNA, suggesting that the various post-transcriptional activities of the L
protein are located in independently folding domains.
