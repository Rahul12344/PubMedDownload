is recognized by circulating antibodies of HIV+ individuals.

A naturally occurring antisense RNA, transcribed in the opposite direction and
complementary to the envelope transcript, was identified in various cell lines
chronically infected with HIV-1. In T cells, the antisense transcript is
constitutively expressed and enhanced by activation with phorbol myristate
acetate. The open reading frame corresponding to the antisense transcript, when
expressed in vitro, encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kDa. 
Antibodies against this protein have been detected in several sera of HIV+
individuals and not in any of the noninfected control sera. These results
indicate, for the first time, that expression of an antisense open reading frame 
most likely accompanies the HIV infection cycle in humans.
