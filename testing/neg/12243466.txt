Three 1-week-old and three 3-month-old Holstein calves that had received
colostrum were inoculated endobronchially with bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV-3). The
gross and histologic lesions in these six infected calves were localized mainly
in the right caudal lobe of the lung and were closely associated with the site of
the deposition of the inoculum. The pneumonic lesions were severe necrotizing
bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis, accompanied by infiltration of
inflammatory cells and proliferation of type 2 pneumocytes. Intranuclear
inclusion bodies, BAV-3 antigen, and virus particles were detected in the
degenerated epithelial cells in the 1-week-old but not the 3-month-old calves.
After infection, the total cell count in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid
cells was increased. The results of BAV-3 isolation from BAL fluid were
correlated with the detection of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the desquamated
epithelial cells in the BAL fluid cells from the right caudal lobe but not in
cells from the left caudal lobe. CD8+ T lymphocytes in the pneumonic lesion were 
found only in the 3-month-old infected calves. The difference in the
immunopathologic reactions between the 1-week-old and the 3-month-old infected
calves may be attributed to differences in immune system development.
