The activity of telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein maintaining the length of
chromosome ends (telomeres) to levels allowing cells to replicate indefinitely,
is undetectable in normal, differentiated cells, is present at low levels in some
activated cell types (including endothelial cells) and it is highly expressed by 
tumor cells. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), the most frequent tumor in Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) patients (AIDS-KS), arises as a disorder of new blood 
vessel formation (angiogenesis), but it may evolve into an aggressive cancer,
characterized by the proliferation and invasion of spindle-shaped,
endothelial-like cells (KS cells, KSC). Here we report that primary KSC express
low telomerase levels which are strongly enhanced by KS initiation and
progression factors including the inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1beta, 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon (IFN)gamma, the angiogenic basic 
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and the Tat protein of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV)-1. Noteworthy, the increase of telomerase activity promoted by these 
molecules parallels the induction of KSC growth and invasion. These preliminary
in vitro findings encourage measuring telomerase activity in AIDS-KS lesions in
order to survey the clinical progression of the disease.
