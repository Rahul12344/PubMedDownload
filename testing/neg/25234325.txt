Simple methods for measuring the levels of serum antibody against canine
distemper virus (CDV) would assist in the effective vaccination of dogs. To
develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for CDV, we
expressed hydrophilic extra-viral domain (HEVD) protein of the A75/17-CDV H gene 
in a pET 28a plasmid-based Escherichia (E.) coli vector system. Expression was
confirmed by dot and Western blotting. We proposed that detection of E.
coli-expressed H protein might be conformation- dependent because intensities of 
the reactions observed with these two methods varied. The H gene HEVD protein was
further purified and used as an antigen for an ELISA. Samples from dogs with
undetectable to high anti-CDV antibody titers were analyzed using this
HEVD-specific ELISA and a commercial CDV antibody detection kit (ImmunoComb).
Levels of HEVD antigenicity measured with the assays and immunochromatography
correlated. These data indicated that the HEDV protein may be used as antigen to 
develop techniques for detecting antibodies against CDV.
