In order to study the relationship between hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA),
hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV RNA) and liver cell carcinoma, HBV DNA and HCV RNA
from the tumor tissue of 42 liver cell carcinoma cases were studied by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and nested-PCR respectively. The results were as follows:
one case of cholangiocarcinoma was positive for both HBV DNA and HCV RNA, and one
case of biliary cystadenoma positive only for HBV DNA. Among the 40 cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 29 were positive for HBV DNA and 13 positive for 
HCV RNA. There was no relationship obtained between HBV or HCV infection and the 
histological types of HCC, and HCV infection in HCC was not interrelated with
HBV. It's considered that although HBV is still to be the leading cause of HCC in
China, HCV may play an important role in hepatic carcinogenesis because of its
high positive rate and increasing incidence.
