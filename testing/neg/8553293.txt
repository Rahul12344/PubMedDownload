BACKGROUND: Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (synonymous with idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis) is a clinically heterogeneous condition in which the
precipitating factor is unclear. Both environmental and infective factors have
been implicated. An association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cryptogenic 
fibrosing alveolitis was suggested over a decade ago by a study based on EBV
serology, but the significance of this has been unclear.
METHODS: Lung tissue obtained surgically from patients (n = 20) with cryptogenic 
fibrosing alveolitis was investigated for evidence of EBV replication and
compared with lung tissue from 21 control patients. Fourteen of the 20 patients
had received no specific therapy for cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis at the time
of biopsy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EBV viral antigens, EBV
viral capsid antigen (VCA) and gp 340/220 antigen, which are expressed during the
lytic phase of the EBV life cycle, were studied.
RESULTS: Fourteen (70%) of the 20 patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis 
were positive for both EBV VCA and gp 340/220 compared with two (9%) of the 21
controls. In the patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis viral replication
was localised to pulmonary epithelial cells using epithelial cell markers, and
immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the staining to be within type II alveolar
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of in vivo EBV replication within
epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract in an immunocompetent human host.
Furthermore, this suggests that EBV may be an immune trigger or contribute to
lung injury in cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, thus offering a potential new
avenue of treatment.
