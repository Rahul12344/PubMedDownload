Pro-inflammatory cytokines are important mediators in immune responses against
invading pathogens, including viruses. Precursors of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18 are processed by caspase-1. Caspase-1 is 
activated through autocleavage, but how this is regulated remained elusive for a 
long time. In 2002, an intracellular multimeric complex was discovered that
facilitated caspase-1 cleavage and was termed 'inflammasome'. To date, different 
inflammasomes have been described, which recognize a variety of ligands and
pathogens. In this review, we discuss the role of inflammasomes in sensing viral 
infection as well as the evasion strategies that viruses developed to circumvent 
inflammasome-dependent effects.
