The authors retrospectively searched for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 
18 in 60 cases of carcinoma arising from the nasal cavities (NC) and paranasal
sinuses (PS) by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. In cases of SCC (n = 49), the authors 
also compared the clinical features of patients with HPV-positive and
HPV-negative results to determine the clinical significance of HPV. HPV 16 and 18
were detected in 7 of the 49 cases (14%) of SCC. In the other histologic types of
carcinoma (n = 11), neither HPV 16 nor HPV 18 was detected. No significant
differences in the clinical features were observed between patients with SCC with
HPV-positive and HPV-negative results. The results suggest that HPV 16 and 18 are
implicated in the pathogenesis of SCC arising from the NC and PS. However, the
presence of HPV is not related to local progression, occurrence of metastases, or
the prognosis of the patients.
