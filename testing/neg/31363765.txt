To evaluate potential enhancement of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection among patients
with prior dengue virus (DENV) infection, we compared loads of viral RNA among
patients infected with ZIKV (n = 1070), DENV-2 (n = 312), or DENV-3 (n = 260).
Compared to patients without prior DENV infection, patients with prior DENV
infection had significantly higher mean loads of viral RNA if infected with
DENV-2 (10.6 vs 11.6 log10 GCE/mL, respectively; t test, P < .0001) or DENV-3
(10.3 vs 10.9 log10 GCE/mL; P < .0001), but not ZIKV (4.7 vs 4.7 log10 GCE/mL; P 
= .959). These findings provide evidence against in vivo enhancement of ZIKV by
anti-DENV antibodies.
