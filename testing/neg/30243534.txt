OBJECTIVE: To develop a dietary methyl donor food frequency questionnaire
(DMD-FFQ) that is validated in a cohort of US children and to determine whether
the consumption of folate and vitamin B12, principal DMDs, correlates with HBV
DNA levels and its methylation density.
STUDY DESIGN: We developed a semiquantitative DMD-FFQ to estimate intake of
folate and vitamin B12 and validated this instrument against a 24-hour dietary
recall and biomarkers-red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12, and
homocysteine-in 35 children with chronic HBV infection without other medical
comorbidities. Estimates of DMD, as well as the serum biomarkers, were correlated
with the methylation density of HBV CpG island 2 and HBV DNA levels.
RESULTS: Folate per kilogram of body weight by the DMD-FFQ correlated positively 
with 24-hour recall (r = 0.60; P < .001) and red blood cell folate (r = 0.40;
P = .02), and negatively with homocysteine (r = -0.54; P < .001). Vitamin B12 per
kilogram by DMD-FFQ also correlated positively with 24-hour recall (r = 0.57;
P < .001) and serum vitamin B12 (r = 0.36, P = .04), and negatively with
homocysteine (r = -0.44; P = .008). Neither DMD intake (from DMD-FFQ or 24-hour
recall) nor serum biomarkers correlated with HBV DNA levels or its methylation
density.
CONCLUSIONS: Our DMD-FFQ correlates well with a 24-hour recall and circulating
biomarkers. Although little evidence existed that consumption of these
micronutrients correlated with HBV replication, this tool could prove useful for 
investigating epigenetic modification by diet for several pediatric diseases.
