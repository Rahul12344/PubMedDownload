Post-transplantation T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.

Lippman SM, Grogan TM, Carry P, Ogden DA, Miller TP.

Immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for large cell
lymphoma of B cell phenotype. This report describes a case of
post-transplantation lymphoma presenting with a mediastinal mass causing superior
vena cava syndrome, tracheal obstruction, and pleural effusion. Cytospin
preparations of pleural fluid documented high-grade lymphoblastic lymphoma
morphology and immature T cell (cortical thymocyte) phenotype: Leu 1-6-positive, 
Leu 9-positive, Tdt-positive, B-negative, Calla-positive. The occurrence of
post-transplantation lymphoma of T cell lineage is inconsistent with the
postulated Epstein-Barr virus origin and raises important questions regarding the
development of lymphoproliferative disorders in immunosuppressed organ transplant
recipients.
