Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), the natural type-1 interferon (IFN) producing
cells, are part of the innate immune defense against human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). PDC numbers are reduced in advanced stages of infection. These cells can
be infected in vivo by HIV since highly purified PDC showed evidence of
infectious HIV. Moreover, when PDC derived from uninfected donors were exposed to
high-titered HIV isolates, productive infection occurred although with low-level 
replication. Using real-time amplification, PDC and unstimulated CD4+ cells were 
found equally susceptible to HIV infection; however, HIV replication was
considerably limited in the PDC. Virus replication was enhanced after PDC
treatment with CD40L and antibodies against IFN-alpha, most likely reflecting the
reduction in IFN-alpha activity. On maturation, the infected PDC showed
multinuclear cell syncytia formation and death. These findings indicate that PDC 
can be reservoirs for HIV dissemination and that HIV infection of PDC can
contribute to their decline.
