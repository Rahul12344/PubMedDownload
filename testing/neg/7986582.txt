Ceramide, an intracellular lipid mediator of tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha) action, was studied for its effects on the expression of the proviral
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 genome in latently infected myelomonocytic
cell lines U-1IIIB and OM-10.1. Ceramide treatment resulted in a 20- to 100-fold 
enhancement of HIV production in these cells. Ceramide also enhanced the
expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene directed by a human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat in transfected U-937 cells,
indicating that ceramide acts at the level of viral transcription. These
observations suggest that the TNF-ceramide signaling system may be involved in
the regulation of HIV expression in certain myeloid cell types.
