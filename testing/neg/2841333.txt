Human T-cells (H9), persistently infected with the HTLV-III strain of human
immunodeficiency virus, were metabolically labeled with D-[2-3H]mannose or
D-[6-3H]glucosamine. The viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, was isolated either 
from cell lysates or from cell-free culture supernatant. After proteolytic
digestion, the radiolabeled oligosaccharides were sequentially liberated from
glycopeptides by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase H and
peptide:N-glycosidase F. Oligosaccharides released were separated from residual
(glyco)peptides and fractionated according to size, charge, and fucose content.
The individual oligosaccharide species obtained were characterized by digestion
with exoglycosidases and by chromatographic comparison with standard
oligosaccharides. Our results demonstrate that the intracellular gp120 carries
predominantly oligomannosidic glycans comprising nine or eight mannose residues. 
The secreted glycoprotein is equally substituted by oligomannosidic species,
containing seven to nine mannose residues, and by fucosylated, partially
sialylated bi- and triantennary complex-type oligosaccharides.
