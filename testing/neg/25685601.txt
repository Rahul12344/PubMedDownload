OBJECTIVE: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) is endemic in poultry in
Viet Nam. The country has experienced the third highest number of human
infections with influenza A(H5N1) in the world. A study in Hanoi in 2001, before 
the epizootic that was identified in 2003, found influenza A(H5N1) specific
antibodies in 4% of poultry market workers (PMWs). We conducted a seroprevalence 
survey to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to influenza A(H5N1) among
PMWs in Hanoi, Thaibinh and Thanhhoa provinces.
METHODS: We selected PMWs from five markets, interviewed them and collected blood
samples. These were then tested using a horse haemagglutination inhibition assay 
and a microneutralization assay with all three clades of influenza A(H5N1)
viruses that have circulated in Viet Nam since 2004.
RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence was 6.1% (95% confidence interval: 4.6-8.3). 
The highest proportion (7.2%) was found in PMWs in Hanoi, and the majority of
seropositive subjects (70.3%) were slaughterers or sellers of poultry.
DISCUSSION: The continued circulation and evolution of influenza A(H5N1) requires
comprehensive surveillance of both human and animal sites throughout the country 
with follow-up studies on PMWs to estimate the risk of avian-human transmission
of influenza A(H5N1) in Viet Nam.
