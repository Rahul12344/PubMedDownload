Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection affects multiple organs including
the cardiovascular system. Postmortem studies have revealed multiple
abnormalities including abnormal coronary artery pathology,
arteriopathy/endothelial dysfunction, hyperlipidemia and hypercoagulability prior
to the use of protease inhibitors. With the introduction of antiretroviral
medications, specifically protease inhibitor therapy, patients with HIV have been
further noted to have premature coronary artery disease, hypercoagulability,
hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, fat redistribution syndrome and increased
tendency to myocardial infarction. In this article, we report on one patient with
HIV disease on protease inhibitor therapy that presented with non-Q-wave
myocardial infarction and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention, and was
later found to have stent thrombosis. A review of the literature showed no other 
previous reports of stent thrombosis secondary to acquired hypercoagulability due
to protease inhibitor therapy. Possible predictors of stent thrombosis and
hypercoagulability are also discussed.
