Human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is a nonclassical HLA class I antigen that is
expressed during pregnancy contributing to maternal-fetal tolerance. HLA-G can be
expressed as membrane-bound and soluble forms. HLA-G expression increases
strongly during viral infections such as congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) 
infections, with functional consequences in immunoregulation. In this work we
investigated the expression of soluble (s)HLA-G and beta-2 microglobulin
(component of HLA) molecules in correlation with the risk of transmission and
severity of congenital HCMV infection. We analyzed 182 blood samples from 130
pregnant women and 52 nonpregnant women and 56 amniotic fluid samples from women 
experiencing primary HCMV infection. The median levels of sHLA-G in maternal
serum of women with primary HCMV infection were higher in comparison with
nonprimary and uninfected pregnant women (p < 0.001). AF from HCMV symptomatic
fetuses presented higher sHLA-G levels in comparison with infected asymptomatic
fetuses (p < 0.001), presence of HLA-G free-heavy chain, and a concentration
gradient from amniotic fluid to maternal blood. No significant statistical
difference of beta-2 microglobulin median levels was observed between all
different groups. Our results suggest the determination of sHLA-G molecules in
both maternal blood and amniotic fluid as a promising biomarker of diagnosis of
maternal HCMV primary infection and fetal HCMV disease.
