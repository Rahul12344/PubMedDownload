OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for bacterial vaginosis (BV) among women
working in the bars and hotels in Moshi, Northern Tanzania.
RESULTS: Severe disturbances of vaginal flora or BV were detected in 70/268
(26.1%) women (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.8%-31.4%). In multivariate
analyses, religion was the only socio-demographic characteristic that remained
significantly associated with BV. Other independent predictors of BV were
Trichomonas vaginalis (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=2.7, 95% CI: 1.4-5.3), Chlamydia 
trachomatis (adjusted OR=3.5, 95% CI: 1.2-10.6), syphilis (adjusted OR=7.1, 95%
CI: 41.1-4.7) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection (adjusted OR=1.8,
95% CI: 1.0-3.3).
CONCLUSION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) was the common cause of genital symptoms in 
the study population. Since sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) were strongly
associated with BV, control of STDs and BV should be given the highest priority
in this population.
