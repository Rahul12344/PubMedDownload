BACKGROUND: To be transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the saliva of their
vectors, arthropod-borne viruses have to cross several barriers in the mosquito
body, including the midgut infection and escape barriers. Yellow fever virus
(YFV) belongs to the genus Flavivirus, which includes human viruses transmitted
by Aedes mosquitoes, such as dengue and Zika viruses. The live-attenuated YFV-17D
vaccine has been used safely and efficiently on a large scale since the end of
World War II. Early studies have shown, using viral titration from salivary
glands of infected mosquitoes, that YFV-17D can infect Aedes aegypti midgut, but 
does not disseminate to other tissues.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we re-visited this issue using a panel of
techniques, such as RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence and titration
assays. We showed that YFV-17D replication was not efficient in Aedes aegypti
midgut, as compared to the clinical isolate YFV-Dakar. Viruses that replicated in
the midgut failed to disseminate to secondary organs. When injected into the
thorax of mosquitoes, viruses succeeded in replicating into midgut-associated
tissues, suggesting that, during natural infection, the block for YFV-17D
replication occurs at the basal membrane of the midgut.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The two barriers associated with Ae. aegypti midgut
prevent YFV-17D replication. Our study contributes to our basic understanding of 
vector-pathogen interactions and may also aid in the development of
non-transmissible live virus vaccines.
