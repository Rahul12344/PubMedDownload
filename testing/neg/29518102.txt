INTRODUCTION: T-cell exhaustion has been involved in the pathogenesis of HIV
infection. We have longitudinally analyzed PD1 and Tim3 surrogate markers of
T-cells exhaustion, in parallel with other markers of HIV progression, and its
potential association with CD4 changes in treated and untreated infection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: 96 HIV patients, 49 of them followed in the absence of cART
(cART-naïve group) and 47 after initiation of cART (cART group) were included and
followed for a median of 43 [IQR: 31-60] months. PD1 and Tim3 expression, CD8
T-cells activation, recent thymic emigrants, activation/apoptosis and turnover of
CD4 cells were assessed at baseline and during follow up. Univariate and
multivariate associations with CD4 evolution were explored.
RESULTS: Parameters significantly associated with CD4 depletion in cART-naïve
group were: baseline level (p = 0.02) and variation (p = 0.002) of PD1 and Tim3
co-expression on CD8, and variation of CD95 expression on CD4 (p = 0.007).
Parameters significantly associated with CD4 restoration in cART group were:
baseline level of CD38+HLADR- subset of CD8 (p = 0.01), variation of PD1
expression on CD8 (p = 0.036), variation of Tim3 expression on CD4 (p = 0.039)
and variation of CD95 expression on CD4 (p = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that PD1 and Tim3 markers of exhaustion have a
pivotal role in CD4 dynamics in HIV patients and its down-regulation would be a
desirable effect of immunotherapies aimed to restore CD4 T-cell pool during
progression of HIV infection.
