Endothelial cells (EC) play a key role in the propagation of inflammatory
responses. Better understanding of inflammatory processes in EC might provide new
ways of controlling inflammation. We report here that the known antioxidant
pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC) leads to time and dose dependent activation of 
heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as well as Hsp32 in EC. We further demonstrate that
PDTC activates heat-shock factor 1 (HSF1), one of several transcription factor
involved in the upregulation of heat-shock proteins. And more importantly, we
demonstrate that Hsp32 as well as Hsp70 can be upregulated independently of the
transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). The presented data
provide further insight into the mechanism of Hsp32 and Hsp70 regulation, as well
as further distinguishing these genes from other so called 'protective genes'
whose upregulation depends on the activation of NF-kappaB. These findings
indicate that Hsp32 and Hsp70 might be ideal candidates among protective genes.
Hsp32 and Hsp70 provide many desirable protective effects but, being independent 
of NF-kappaB, would leave open the option to interfere with the upregulation of
proinflammatory genes by modulating the activation of NF-kappaB.
