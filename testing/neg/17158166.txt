Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V) is a comprehensive virus
genome/segment database. We extracted 18 418 complete virus genomes/segments from
the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC,
http://www.insdc.org/) by DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), EMBL and GenBank and
stored them in our system. The list of registered viruses is arranged
hierarchically according to taxonomy. Keyword searches can be performed for
genome/segment data or biological features of any virus stored in GIB-V. GIB-V is
equipped with a BLAST search function, and search results are displayed
graphically or in list form. Moreover, the BLAST results can be used online with 
the ClustalW feature of the DDBJ. All available virus genome/segment data can be 
collected by the GIB-V download function. GIB-V can be accessed at no charge at
http://gib-v.genes.nig.ac.jp/.
