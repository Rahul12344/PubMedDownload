Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the in vitro amplification of
dengue virus RNA via cDNA. A fraction of the N-terminus gene of the envelope
protein in the four dengue serotypes was amplified using synthetic
oligonucleotide primer pairs. Amplified products were cloned and used as dengue
type-specific probes in gel electrophoresis and dot-blot hybridization. We
detected and characterized dengue virus serotypes in blood samples by the
three-step procedure DNA-PAH consisting in cDNA priming (P), DNA amplification
(A) and hybridization (H) using specific non-radiolabelled probes. Our findings
showed that DNA-PAH was more rapid and sensitive in the identification of the
infecting serotype than the mosquito cell cultures. Moreover, the failure of
cultures to detect virus particles in sera containing few copies of viral genome 
or anti-dengue antibodies justified the approach of DNA-PAH to the dengue
identification in clinical specimens.
