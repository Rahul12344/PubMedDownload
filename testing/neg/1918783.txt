OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence, incidence, types, and certain
characteristics of antibiotics prescribed in nursing homes.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Periodic survey over 1 year of patient charts in 53
stratified, randomly selected nursing homes in the state of Maryland.
PATIENTS: All patients 65 years of age or more residing in these nursing homes on
the first day of study.
RESULTS: Of 4,165 patients in 53 nursing homes, records over the year were
satisfactory in 3,899 patients in 52 nursing homes. The prevalence of antibiotic 
use on the first day of the study was 8%. Over the next 12 months, observations
of more than one million patient-days revealed an incidence of 0.46 antibiotic
courses/100 patient-days; 54% of the 3,899 patients received at least one
antibiotic course. For presumed active infections, beta lactam antibiotics were
the most commonly used, 54% of antibiotic orders. For all antibiotics, urinary
tract infection was the most common indication, eliciting 36% of orders including
9% for asymptomatic bacteriuria. Skin, lower respiratory, and upper respiratory
infections comprised 14%-17% each. Physicians prescribed 94% of courses but
documented examinations of only 44% of patients at the outset of these courses.
Consensus criteria for minimal diagnostic evaluation of four selected infections 
were met in only 11% of episodes of infection. Although the most serious
infections tended to be better evaluated than others, 31% of the former were not 
noted to have been examined by a physician. Three percent of orders were for
prophylaxis and two-thirds of these antibiotics were administered for more than 2
days.
CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics are frequently prescribed for aged nursing home
patients, often in the absence of a physician's examination and other features
commonly performed in evaluation of specific infectious diseases. More than
one-fifth of antibiotics prescribed by presumed active infections were for two
infections usually thought not to require antibiotic therapy, "viral" upper
respiratory infection (13%) and asymptomatic bacteriuria (9%). To optimize
antibiotic use in nursing homes, greater attention should be directed to
appropriate durations of prophylaxis for urologic, dental, and minor surgical
procedures; to standards for diagnostic evaluations of common infections; and to 
the roles of antibiotics in upper respiratory infections and in asymptomatic
bacteriuria.
