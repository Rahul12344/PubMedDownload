Effect of prostaglandins on cell function and multiplication of parainfluenza 3
viruses in WISH cells.

Luczak M, Gumulka W, Szmigielski S, Korbecki M, Lasota W.

Cytotoxic effect of prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha on cells grown in vitro and the
influence of these compounds on multiplication of myxovirus parainfluenza 3 were 
investigated. The prostaglandins were added to culture medium (0-01-10 mug/ml) 24
hr before virus infection, or for 2 and 48 hr after inoculation with viruses.
WISH cells and monkey kidney cell cultures were used. No direct cytotoxic effect 
of prostaglandins at concentrations 0-01-1 mug/ml was found (viability,
supravital staining, phase-contrast system, Nitro-BT reduction and succinic
dehydrogenase tests), whereas the concentration of 10 mug/ml within 48 hr led to 
reduction and succinic dehydrogenase tests), whereas the concentration of 10
mug/ml within 48 hr led to partial injury of the cell population with symptoms of
damage to mitochondria. Prostaglandins E2 and F2alpha inhibited multiplication of
parainfluenza 3 virus at concentrations 0-1-10 mug/ml. The inhibitory effect was 
most pronounced if prostaglandins were added to medium for the whole period of
virus multiplication i.e. for 48 hr but little or no effect was found if they
were added prior to inoculation or for 2 hr after it. Inhibitory effect of
prostaglandins on replication phase of viruses is suggested.
