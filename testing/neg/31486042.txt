In vivo studies are the mainstay of translational immune-oncology and virotherapy
research. In general oncology, bioluminescence imaging provides a convenient and 
reliable tool to visualize disseminated tumors and monitor growth kinetics or
treatment effects. Unique aspects of this method in the field of oncolytic
viruses are tracing the process of tumor-specific targeting, assessing potential 
off-target replication, and visualizing intratumoral spread. In addition, the
longitudinal monitoring of virus activity kinetics over time is a very powerful
feature supporting the subsequent, oftenÂ elaborate, preclinical biodistribution
and pharmtox program. Here we present a step-by-step standard imaging protocol
used in our group for both tumor and virus monitoring, along with background
information and general principles that should allow the reader to modify and
adapt the protocol according to their needs.
