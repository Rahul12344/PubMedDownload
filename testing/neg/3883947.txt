Orf. A case report with histologic, electron microscopic, and immunoperoxidase
studies.

Sanchez RL, Hebert A, Lucia H, Swedo J.

Orf is an occupational skin disease acquired through contact with infected
animals. In humans, orf is usually a self-limited disease that resolves
spontaneously within four to 24 weeks. We report a case with multiple lesions of 
orf, acquired by contact with a wild sheep. The patient was temporarily
immunosuppressed by a concomitant viral hepatitis. We reviewed the histologic and
electron microscopic findings. Also, we attempted to stain the Parapoxvirus in
the skin of the patient, using the immunoperoxidase technique. The antiserum was 
obtained from sheep immunized against orf. We used lesional skin from sheep
infected with orf as a positive control. The negative results of this technique
in the patient's skin indicated that Parapoxvirus infecting wild sheep is
antigenically different from that causing the disease in domestic animals.
