We developed robust, ultrasensitive, and accurate quantitative assays for
maedi-visna virus (MVV) RNA and DNA genomic sequences and mRNA's expressed at
various stages of lentiviral replication. Assay design was based on PCR with
real-time fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements. Specific assays
were developed for gag-pol (genomic), tat, rev, env, and vif transcripts. Assay
linearity ranged from 60 to 6 x 10(7) copies of target DNA. All assays were able 
to detect and measure corresponding mRNA's in MVV-infected FOS cells, whereas no 
signal was detected in mock-treated cells. In addition, RT-PCR based on
amplification of gag sequences could be used to quantify RNA genomic sequences in
supernatants from infected cells. These quantitative assays can be used to study 
the role of genetic elements in MVV infection and pathogenesis. They also allow
rapid testing of lentiviral vectors and packaging systems based on MVV.
