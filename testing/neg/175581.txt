The results of a comparative study of different routes of inoculation of simian
hemorrhagic fever (SHF) virus to Macaca monkeys are presented as well as the
results of virological examinations of sick animals. Only the parenteral route of
inoculation has been found to be effective. After virus penetration, a long-term 
viremia and generalization of the infection are observed. The virus is found in
the brain, the spinal cord and bone marrow, the spleen, the liver, the kidneys,
the cerebrospinal fluid, the urine and nasopharyngeal washings. By the
fluorescent antibody technique the virus-specific antigen is demonstrated in the 
capillary endothelium, neurons and glial cells of the brain, and in the
reticulo-endothelial and macrophagal elements of parenchymatous organs.
