The frequency of chromosome damage was studied in the carriers of virus of the
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (Puumala virus) and in noninfected animals 
from two laboratory colonies and two natural populations of bank vole. In the
laboratory colony, where Puumala virus persisted for three years, multiaberrant
("rogue") cells were found in the bone marrow; the mean frequencies of both
structural and numeral chromosome abnormalities were significantly enhanced. In
the other laboratory colony, no Puumala virus was detected during all 30 years of
its existence, but the mean frequencies of structural chromosome damage were
increased to the same degree probably due to the prolonged breeding under
laboratory conditions, which resulted in suppression of immunity and DNA repair. 
The voles from the natural populations were more resistant to the clastogenic
viral effect, but they also had multiaberrant cells which served as indicators of
viral infection. The data obtained support the hypothesis that viral infections
increase mutation rate, contributing thereby to the evolution process.
