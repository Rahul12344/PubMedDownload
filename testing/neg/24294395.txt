CD56 positive B-cell lymphoma is very rare. We experienced a case of CD56
positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, occurred in a young child. A 5-year-old
girl complained with snoring and open mouth breathing. No any abnormality in
laboratory or physical examination was present, except enlarged both tonsils.
Bilateral tonsillectomy was performed. Cut sections of right tonsil showed a 2 cm
size, solid mass. On microscopically, large monomorphic lymphoid cells were
diffusely proliferated and showed positivity for CD20 and CD56 and negative for
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Monoclonality was
observed on immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. This is a unique case 
with incidentally found and occurred in a young child.
