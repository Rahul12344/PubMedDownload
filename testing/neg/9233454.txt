OBJECTIVES: To study the role of HIV-1 biological phenotype, viral load and
neutralizing antibodies in male-to-female heterosexual transmission of HIV-1.
METHODS: Seven transmitting and seven non-transmitting HIV-1-seropositive
heterosexual male index cases were included in the present study. All couples had
engaged in unprotected sex for a period of over 1 year. Transmission was defined 
by the seroconversion of the female sexual partner. Virus isolates were tested in
MT-2 cells for replication and syncytia induction. HIV-1 RNA plasma load was
measured by the branched DNA technique. Serum neutralizing activity to primary
HIV-1 isolates was tested by using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) as
target cells.
RESULTS: Non-transmitting index cases had a lower HIV-1 RNA concentration in
plasma than transmitting index cases. Non-transmitting index cases also tended to
have serum neutralizing activity with broad specificity and to have viruses with 
low replicative capacity, as characterized by 50% infectious dose titres in PBMC 
and by the lack of MT-2 tropism.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that plasma viral-RNA load is a marker for
transmission. Moreover, an interplay between the host immune response and viral
replication may modulate the level of viral load and thereby influence HIV-1
transmission.
