Retroviruses, a form of mobile genetic elements, have important roles in disease 
and primate evolution. Exogenous retroviruses, such as human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), have significant pathological implications that have created a
massive public health challenge in recent years. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), 
which are the primary focus of this review, can also be pathogenic, as well as
being beneficial to a host in some cases. Furthermore, retroviruses may have
played a key role in primate evolution that resulted in the incorporation of
these elements into the human genome. Retroviruses are mobile genetic elements
that have important roles in disease and primate evolution. We will further
discuss the pathogenic potential of retroviruses, including their role in cancer 
biology, and will briefly summarize their evolutionary implications.
