Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has long been discussed as a possible cause or trigger
of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). In a subset of patients the disease starts
with infectious mononucleosis and both enhanced and diminished EBV-specific
antibody titers have been reported. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed
the EBV-specific memory B- and T-cell response in patients with CFS. While we
observed no difference in viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG antibodies, EBV nuclear 
antigen (EBNA)-IgG titers were low or absent in 10% of CFS patients. Remarkably, 
when analyzing the EBV-specific memory B-cell reservoir in vitro a diminished or 
absent number of EBNA-1- and VCA-antibody secreting cells was found in up to 76% 
of patients. Moreover, the ex vivo EBV-induced secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ was
significantly lower in patients. Multicolor flow cytometry revealed that the
frequencies of EBNA-1-specific triple TNF-α/IFN-γ/IL-2 producing CD4(+) and
CD8(+) T-cell subsets were significantly diminished whereas no difference could
be detected for HCMV-specific T-cell responses. When comparing EBV load in blood 
immune cells, we found more frequently EBER-DNA but not BZLF-1 RNA in CFS
patients compared to healthy controls suggesting more frequent latent
replication. Taken together, our findings give evidence for a deficient
EBV-specific B- and T-cell memory response in CFS patients and suggest an
impaired ability to control early steps of EBV reactivation. In addition the
diminished EBV response might be suitable to develop diagnostic marker in CFS.
