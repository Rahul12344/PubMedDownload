Immune regulation of cellular metabolism can be responsible for successful
responses to invading pathogens. Viruses alter their hosts' cellular metabolism
to facilitate infection. Conversely, the innate antiviral responses of mammalian 
cells target these metabolic pathways to restrict viral propagation. We
identified miR-130b and miR-185 as hepatic microRNAs (miRNAs) whose expression is
stimulated by 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an antiviral oxysterol secreted by
interferon-stimulated macrophages and dendritic cells, during hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. However, 25-HC only directly stimulated miR-185 expression,
whereas HCV regulated miR-130b expression. Independently, miR-130b and miR-185
inhibited HCV infection. In particular, miR-185 significantly restricted host
metabolic pathways crucial to the HCV life cycle. Interestingly, HCV infection
decreased miR-185 and miR-130b levels to promote lipid accumulation and
counteract 25-HC's antiviral effect. Furthermore, miR-185 can inhibit other
viruses through the regulation of immunometabolic pathways. These data establish 
these microRNAs as a key link between innate defenses and metabolism in the
liver.
