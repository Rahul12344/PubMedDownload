Since its discovery in 1947 in Uganda and control and eradication efforts have
aimed at its vectors (Aedes mosquitoes) in Latin America in the 1950s, an
absolute neglect of Zika programs and interventions has been documented in Aedes 
endemic and epidemic-prone countries. The current unprecedented Zika viral
epidemics and rapid spread in the Western hemisphere pose a substantial global
threat, with associated anxiety and consequences. The lack of safe and effective 
drugs and vaccines against Zika or dengue epidemics further buttresses the
realization from the West Africa Ebola outbreak that most emerging disease-prone 
countries are still poorly prepared for an emergency response. This paper
examines knowledge gaps in both emerging and neglected arthropod-borne flavivirus
infectious diseases associated with poverty and their implications for fostering 
local, national and regional emerging disease preparedness, effective and robust 
surveillance-response systems, sustained control and eventual elimination.
Strengthening the regional and Global Health Flavivirus Surveillance-Response
Network (GHFV-SRN) with other models of socio-economic, climatic, environmental
and ecological mitigation and adaptation strategies will be necessary to improve 
evidence-based national and global maternal-child health agenda and action plans.
