Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) conjugation to proteins has essential roles 
in several processes including localization, stability, and function of several
players implicated in intrinsic and innate immunity. In human, five paralogs of
SUMO are known of which three are ubiquitously expressed (SUMO1, 2, and 3).
Infection by rhabdoviruses triggers cellular responses through the activation of 
pattern recognition receptors, which leads to the production and secretion of
interferon. This review will focus on the effects of the stable expression of the
different SUMO paralogs or Ubc9 depletion on rhabdoviruses-induced interferon
production and interferon signaling pathways as well as on the expression and
functions of restriction factors conferring the resistance to rhabdoviruses.
