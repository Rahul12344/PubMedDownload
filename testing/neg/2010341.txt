A midwestern producer reported high incidence of conjunctivitis and
keratoconjunctivitis in a herd of crossbred finishing swine. Complete necropsy
was performed on 3 pigs with bilateral mucopurulent conjunctivitis and chemosis; 
other gross lesions were not seen. Mycoplasma sp was isolated from conjunctival
swab specimens obtained from 1 pig; small numbers of streptococci and
coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from conjunctival swab specimens
from all 3 pigs. Neither swine influenza virus nor pseudorabies virus was
isolated from conjunctival swab specimens. Histologically, the 3 pigs had chronic
lymphoplasmacytic conjunctivitis with lymphofollicular hyperplasia and foci of
epithelial and goblet cell hyperplasia. Ultrastructural examination of
conjunctival specimens from the 3 pigs revealed large numbers of Mycoplasma-like 
organisms adhered to superficial conjunctival cells. Mycoplasma-like organisms
also were seen in membrane-bound vacuoles in superficial conjunctival cells.
Bacteria (including chlamydiae) or viruses were not seen ultrastructurally. The
lymphoproliferative nature of the conjunctival lesion and the evidence of adhered
and intracellular organisms suggested an etiologic role for a Mycoplasma-like
organism in the disease in these pigs.
