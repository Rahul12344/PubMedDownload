Studies on Virus Diarrhea and Mucosal Disease of Cattle.

Thomson RG, Savan M.

Outbreaks of virus diarrhea and mucosal disease were studied and certain clinical
and pathological criteria applied in making a diagnosis of one or the other
disease. An attempt was made to verify the diagnosis in each case by serological 
means in field outbreaks and by transmission of the disease experimentally in
calves using post-mortem material.Serological studies in field outbreaks produced
inconclusive results. Quite consistent results were obtained from transmission
trials. Experimental calves developed diphasic temperature rises, leukopenia, and
oral hyperemia with or without erosions. Specific antibody induced in
experimental calves was capable of neutralizing the standard Oregon C24V strain
of virus diarrhea. It was therefore apparent that the viral isolates obtained
from nine outbreaks in this study were closely related. It was concluded that
there were not two diseases, but one, and that according to priority should be
called virus diarrhea.
