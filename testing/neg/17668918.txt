BACKGROUND: It has been previously demonstrated that plasmid DNA transport into
the nucleus could be increased by transcription factor binding. We chose the
glucocorticoid responsive element (GRE) which binds to the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR), a transcription factor which is shuttled into the nucleus upon
ligand binding such as dexamethasone.
METHODS: We cloned two, four, and eight repetitive sequences of the GRE into the 
reporter plasmid pEGFPLuc. Binding of the pEGFPLuc-GRE to the GR was examined by 
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments. GR expression in
bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells was confirmed by Western blotting.
Intracellular trafficking of GR was examined using a fusion protein of
cyano-fluorescent protein (CFP) and GR. Transfection efficiencies of pEGFPLuc
compared to pEGFPLucGRE(2-8) were examined in vitro and in vivo upon tail vein
injection of cationic liposome gene vectors containing dexamethasone (safeplexes)
and aerosol application of polyethylenimine (PEI)-pDNA particles.
RESULTS: Binding of GRE containing plasmids to the GR was shown in EMSA
experiments and intranuclear shuttling of CFP-GR after ligand stimulation was
confirmed. Enhanced gene transfer efficiency of pEGFPLucGRE(2) in vitro was only 
observed on confluent cells. A 2.5-fold increase in gene expression in the lungs 
of mice after tail vein injection of pEGFPLucGRE(2) complexed with safeplexes
compared with pEGFPLuc was observed. PEI-mediated aerosol gene delivery of
pEGFPLucGRE(2) was 4.7-fold higher than pEGFPLuc only after intraperitoneal
dexamethasone.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that inclusion of GRE sequences into plasmid DNA 
vectors combined with dexamethasone application could improve transgene
expression in the lungs in vivo.
