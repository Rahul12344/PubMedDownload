BACKGROUND: Variations of C gene give rise to precore and basal core mutations,
which influence HBeAg expression The antiviral treatment failure is due to the
presence of variations in the gene P, which cause mutations in the viral
polymerase.
METHODS: We performed genotyping of HBV P gene by sequencing, and gene C in
patients with chronic hepatitis B over a period of five years.
RESULTS: A total of 75% of the patients had some mutation in precore or in basal 
core promoter regions, and 37% demonstrated resistance mutations to antiviral
treatment. The most frequent genotypes were A and D.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of mutations in core/precore regions in patients with
chronic hepatitis has led to tighter control of these patients. Detecting for
resistance should be done as quickly as possible before there is an increase in
viral load.
