We have developed a panel of synthetic glycans as receptor mimics for the
specific capture of influenza viruses. The glycans were printed onto commercial
glass slides using a free amine at the end of a spacer to generate a small
focused microarray. The microarray was evaluated for its ability to capture three
different strains of influenza A virus, two H1N1, A/Brisbane/59/2007 and
A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 and one H3N2, A/Aichi/2/1968. We observed an excellent
detection ability with some compounds exhibiting clinically relevant (10(1)
plaque forming units) limit of detection. We also tested the drug susceptibility 
of current antivirals, Zanamivir and Ostelamivir using this microarray and could 
determine antiviral resistance for these strains.
