Prevalence of feline immunodeficiency virus in submissions of feline serum to a
diagnostic laboratory in Atlantic Canada.

Hitt ME, Spangler L, McCarville C.

The purpose of this project was to identify the prevalence of feline
immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in the Atlantic region of Canada, and to determine
possible associations between FIV serological status and breed, sex, and age.
Feline serum samples (671) submitted to the Prince Edward Island Diagnostic
Services - Atlantic Veterinary College laboratory between January 1, 1988 and
July 30, 1989 were considered eligible for this study. The majority of samples
originated from Prince Edward Island (607). Testing was performed in duplicate
using commercial 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test kits for FIV
antibody. Results included a seropositive rate of 7.6% for all submissions. Mean 
age of FIV-seropositive cats was eight years. There was an increasing risk of
FIV-seropositive status associated with age. Prevalence of FIV among intact males
was significantly higher (odds ratio = 2.59) than other gender categories. The
principal conclusion of this study was that FIV is present in cats of the
Atlantic provinces, and that its associations and prevalence are consistent with 
those found in other North American epidemiological studies.
