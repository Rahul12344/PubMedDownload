Demonstration of Eimeria tenella in bursa of Fabricius of chickens.

Anderson WI, Giambrone JJ, Fletcher OJ Jr, Eidson CS, Reid WM.

Coccidial life-cytle stages were detected in the bursa of Fabricius of broiler
chickens inoculated with Eimeria tenella, whether or not the chickens had
previously been infected with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Chickens
infected only with E. tenella had developing parasites in the lining epithelium, 
whereas chickens with both infections had gametocytes also in the epithelial
cells surrounding numerous degenerating bursal cysts.
