BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Seasonal distribution of microbial aetiology in
patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) may add important information
both for epidemiologists and clinicians. We investigate the seasonal distribution
of microbial aetiology in CAP.
METHODS: This prospective observational study was carried out in the Hospital
Clinic of Barcelona, Spain (January 2003-December 2014).
RESULTS: We studied 4431 patients with CAP, of whom 2689 (61%) were males.
Microbial aetiology was identified in 1756 patients (40%). CAP was most frequent 
in winter (34%) but two-third of patients with CAP presented in other seasons.
Seasonal variations included Streptococcus pneumoniae (winter 21% vs spring 17%
vs summer 14% vs autumn 13%, overall P < 0.001). Influenza viruses were most
prevalent in autumn (6%) and winter (5%) compared with spring (3%) and summer
(1%) (overall P < 0.001). Legionella pneumophila was most frequent in autumn (4%)
and summer (4%) compared with spring (2%) and winter (1%) (overall P < 0.001).
Incidence of polymicrobial pneumonia also differed between seasons (winter 7% vs 
spring 5% vs summer 3% vs autumn 6%, overall P = 0.001). We observed a
significant correlation between the lowest seasonal average temperature and
polymicrobial pneumonia, pneumococcal pneumonia, and influenza viruses;
conversely, L. pneumophila was more common when temperatures were higher.
CONCLUSION: CAP should not be regarded as a seasonal disease but occurs
throughout all seasons. However, S. pneumoniae, influenza viruses, polymicrobial 
pneumonia and L. pneumophila are clearly subject to seasonal variations.
