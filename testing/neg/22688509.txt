PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare the virologic response to adefovir
(ADV) add-on therapy with switching to entecavir (ETV) monotherapy in children
and adolescents with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who have developed lamivudine
(LAM) resistance during LAM treatment.
METHODS: Twenty-seven consecutive patients with CHB who had developed LAM
resistance during LAM treatment were included. Of these 27 patients, 8 patients
were treated with the addition of ADV to ongoing LAM and 8 patients were treated 
by switching to ETV monotherapy and each of these 16 patients were compared with 
the 11 patients who were treated by switching to ADV alone, as a historical
control. Therapeutic responses to treatment were evaluated at 12, 24, 36, and 48 
weeks from the initiation of therapy by measuring the decrement of hepatitis B
virus (HBV)-DNA titers.
RESULTS: The therapeutic period for HBV-DNA titer decrement (>2  log(10) IU/mL)
was significantly shorter in both the LAM+ADV group and the ETV group than in the
ADV group (P = 0.008); however, there was no significant difference between the
LAM+ADV group and the ETV group. The rate of virologic response, defined as
decrement in HBV-DNA titer to undetectable levels at 24 weeks, was significantly 
higher in both the LAM+ADV group and the ETV group than in the ADV group
(P = 0.029).
CONCLUSIONS: Both the LAM+ADV combination therapy and ETV monotherapy exhibited
significantly more effective virologic responses compared to the ADV monotherapy 
in children and adolescents with LAM-resistant CHB, although there was no
significant difference between the LAM+ADV group and the ETV group.
