Atypical lymphocytes with clover leaf nucleus are a frequent finding in adult
type T-cell leukemia, and are occasionally seen in an overnight blood sample.
This type of cell has apparently never previously been reported in
cytomegaloviral infection. The case of a thirty-seven-day-old female infant
presented with cytomegalovirus induced mononucleosis syndrome; her blood smear
revealed atypical lymphocytes with clover leaf nucleus.
