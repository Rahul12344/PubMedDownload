Embryonic erythroid cells transformed by avian erythroblastosis virus may
proliferate and differentiate.

Jurdic P, Bouabdelli M, Moscovici MG, Moscovici C.

Embryonic chick cells from the primitive streak stage to later stages of the
developing embryo were infected with avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV). The data
indicate that the greatest number of target cells for AEV was observed in the
12-somite blastoderm and gradually decreased in hemopoietic tissues with the
development of the embryo. The target cell for AEV is not in the BFU-E
compartment, as it is in the adult bone marrow, but is probably recruited within 
the CFU-M compartment which precedes the BFU-E compartment. Our studies also show
that a significant number of transformed colonies derived from embryonic
hemopoietic tissues undergo hemoglobinization in contrast with what is observed
in transformed colonies of bone marrow. A complete characterization of the
embryonic and adult hemoglobin is at present under study.
