PURPOSE: To compare the clinical findings in patients with anterior uveitis (AU) 
caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and
cytomegalovirus (CMV).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical profiles of HSV-AU (14
patients), VZV sine herpete (ZSH-AU: 21 patients), and CMV-AU (17 patients)
diagnosed by the detection of corresponding viral DNA in aqueous humor samples by
polymerase chain reaction. Further, five patients with Posner-Schlossman (P-S)
syndrome were selected as controls for CMV-AU.
RESULTS: Patients with CMV-AU were predominately male or older in age, and all
cases were unilateral except for three patients with CMV-AU. Mutton-fat keratic
precipitates (KPs) were found mostly in patients with HSV-AU and ZSH-AU.
Severities of AU and viral load were the highest in ZSH-AU, followed by HSV-AU
and CMV-AU. Iris atrophy was observed in HSV-AU (50%) and ZSH-AU (76%), with
typical morphology of round type and sector type, respectively. In patients with 
CMV-AU, a ring-shaped KP was found in 53% patients, 76% of whom showed a
decreased number of corneal endothelial cells. CMV was not detected in the
aqueous humor of patients with typical P-S syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Clinical findings of HSV-AU and VZV-AU were similar; however, more
inflammatory findings were observed in VZV-AU. Iris atrophy morphologically
differed in HSV-AU and VZV-AU. Inflammatory findings in CMV-AU were mild, and
clinical features of iritis differed from those of the two former groups. A
difference in the etiology between CMV-AU and P-S syndrome was observed.
