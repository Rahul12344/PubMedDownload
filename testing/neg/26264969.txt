As prostate tumor cell growth depends on hormones, androgen ablation is an
effective therapy for prostate cancer (PCa). However, progression of PCa cells to
androgen independent growth (castrate resistant prostate cancer, CRPC) results in
relapse and mortality. Hypoxia, a microenvironment of low oxygen that modifies
the activity of PCa regulatory proteins including the androgen receptor (AR),
plays a critical role in progression to CRPC. Therapies targeting hypoxia and the
AR may lengthen the time to CRPC progression thereby increasing survival time of 
PCa patients. Mammalian Orthoreovirus (MRV) has shown promise for the treatment
of prostate tumors in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that MRV
infection induces downregulation of proteins implicated in CRPC progression,
interferes with hypoxia-induced AR activity, and induces apoptosis in androgen
dependent cells. This suggests MRV possesses traits that could be exploited to
create novel therapies for the inhibition of progression to CRPC.
