Human thioredoxin and antibacterial peptide, PR39, have been shown to have potent
antioxidant effects that may prolong survival of cells during hypoxia. The
pSSCMV/human thioredoxin-PR39 vector was successfully constructed in this study
and used to infect ECV304 cells. Transfected ECV304 cells were incubated at 1%,
5% hypoxic, and normal oxygen conditions. We found that the number of apoptotic
cells after transfection with recombinant adeno-associated virus-human
thioredoxin -PR39 was significantly lower than controls, suggesting a protective 
effect of the recombinant human thioredoxin-PR39 protein on hypoxic cells.
