Guidelines for the control of human immunodeficiency virus infection in
adolescents.

Oliva GE, Rutherford GW, Grossman M, Shalwitz J, English A, Taylor F, Werdegar D.

Although adolescents account for only 0.4% of reported cases of the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the United States, they are sexually active
and, therefore, at risk of acquiring human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
infection. To address issues of HIV control in adolescents, we developed
guidelines that emphasize education and medical care and deemphasize antibody
testing. For adolescents known to be infected with HIV, we recommend no
restrictions on access to educational or treatment programs except when their
health providers recommend such restrictions to protect them from exposure to
opportunistic infections. For adolescents of unknown antibody status with a
possible previous exposure to HIV, we recommend that as long as the incidence of 
HIV infection and clinical AIDS remains low, there should be no restrictions on
residential placements and no routine antibody testing.
