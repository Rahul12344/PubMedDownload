Traditional treatment of otosyphilis with penicillin and corticosteroids has
achieved hearing improvement; however, selecting which patients with a positive
fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test will benefit from
treatment remains a problem. In order to study this problem, 18 patients with
cochleovestibular dysfunction of unknown etiology and positive syphilis serology 
were treated with intravenous penicillin and corticosteroids. In addition, lumbar
puncture and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were performed on all
patients. Hearing improved in 5 (31%) of 16 patients, tinnitus decreased in 11
(85%) of 13, and vertigo improved in 6 (86%) of 7. Factors associated with
hearing improvement were hearing loss present less than 5 years, fluctuating
hearing, and age less than 60. Improvement was unrelated to the severity of the
loss or previous therapy. All patients with cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities,
including two patients with HIV disease, had subjective improvements. A
diagnostic and treatment protocol is presented.
