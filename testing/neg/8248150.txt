The retroviral integrase protein (IN) is responsible for catalyzing a concerted
integration reaction in which the two termini of linear viral DNA are joined to
host DNA. To probe the potential for IN to form protein multimers, we used the
yeast two-hybrid system. The coexpression of a GAL4 DNA binding domain-IN fusion 
and a GAL4 activation domain-IN fusion together resulted in the successful
activation of a GAL4-responsive LacZ reporter gene. The system was used to
examine a variety of IN deletion mutants. The results suggest that the central
region of the protein is necessary for multimerization and that the N-terminal
zinc finger region is not important.
