Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first emerged in late
2012. Since its emergence, a total of 2279 patients from 27 countries have been
infected across the globe according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report
(Feb. 12th, 2019). Approximately 806 patients have died. The virus uses its spike
proteins as adhesive factors that are proinflammatory for host entry through a
specific receptor called dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4). This receptor is
considered a key factor in the signaling and activation of the acquired and
innate immune responses in infected patients. Using potent antigens in
combination with strong adjuvants may effectively trigger the activation of
specific MERS-CoV cellular responses as well as the production of neutralizing
antibodies. Unfortunately, to date, there is no effective approved treatment or
vaccine for MERS-CoV. Thus, there are urgent needs for the development of novel
MERS-CoV therapies as well as vaccines to help minimize the spread of the virus
from infected patients, thereby mitigating the risk of any potential pandemics.
Our main goals are to highlight and describe the current knowledge of both the
innate and adaptive immune responses to MERS-CoV and the current state of
MERS-CoV vaccine development. We believe this study will increase our
understanding of the mechanisms that enhance the MERS-CoV immune response and
subsequently contribute to the control of MERS-CoV infections.
