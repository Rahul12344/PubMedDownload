Acute hepatitis B superimposed on patients with chronic hepatitis C is a rarely
observed event, especially in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-prevalent areas where
chronic HBV infection is usually acquired perinatally or at early infancy. The
interactive relationship between HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and clinical
outcome in such patients remains controversial. We report a case of acute HBV
superinfection which occurred during follow-up of chronic HCV infection in a
66-year-old woman. The patient developed hepatic decompensation at the acute
stage. Unlike previously reported cases in Taiwanese, in which the patient either
died of fulminant hepatic failure or subsequently relapsed with HCV viremia, this
chronic hepatitis C patient with acute HBV superinfection had virologic remission
with undetectable HBV DNA and HCV RNA during 9 months of follow-up.
