Genomic length cDNAs of papaya mosaic virus (PMV) RNA were generated utilizing
reverse transcriptase (RNase H-) for first strand synthesis, Sequenase for second
strand synthesis and primers specific for the 5' and 3' termini of the viral
genome. These cDNAs were cloned into plasmid pUC18 and infectious RNA transcripts
were synthesized in vitro from a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter
incorporated into the 5' specific primer. The infectivity of transcripts was 16% 
that of native PMV RNA. Increasing the poly(A) tail length from A24 to A71
produced a 43% increase in infectivity. Transcripts synthesized with or without
an m7GpppG cap structure were biologically active although uncapped transcripts
were much less infectious. The addition of up to 2434 non-viral nucleotides at
the 3' end of transcripts decreased but did not abolish infectivity. Insertions
of two amino acid residues within the polymerase coding region inactivated viral 
transcripts. A single amino acid deletion within the capsid protein (CP) produced
local lesions of a reduced size as compared to native PMV RNA. Viral particles
could not be observed in crude extracts from lesions produced by this deletion
mutant suggesting that it exists as a naked RNA species within the host.
Mutations to the CP suggest that it is required not only for viral assembly but
also for some other unidentified function(s) during the replication cycle.
