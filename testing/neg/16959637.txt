Recent avian flu epidemics (A/H5N1) in Southeast Asia and case reports from
around the world have led to fears of a human pandemic. Control of these
outbreaks in birds would probably lead to reduced transmission of the avian virus
to humans. This study presents a mathematical model based on stochastic
farm-to-farm transmission that incorporates flock size and spatial contacts to
evaluate the impact of control strategies. Fit to data from the recent epidemic
in the Netherlands, we evaluate the efficacy of control strategies and forecast
avian influenza dynamics. Our results identify high-risk areas of spread by
mapping of the farm level reproductive number. Results suggest that an immediate 
depopulation of infected flocks following an accurate and quick diagnosis would
have a greater impact than simply depopulating surrounding flocks. Understanding 
the relative importance of different control measures is essential for response
planning.
