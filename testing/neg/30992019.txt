BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is one of the leading causes of
liver cancer, creating enormous economic and social burdens. The Chinese
government recommends routine screening of inpatients for HCV before invasive
procedures to prevent iatric infections. However, the diagnosis and treatment
rates for HCV remain low. The aim of this study was to use available routine
screening data to understand the HCV screening of inpatients in different regions
of China.
METHODS: Inpatient information and HCV screening results were collected from
January 2016 to December 2016 at eight tertiary hospitals in different regions of
China to compare the HCV-positivity of hospitalized patients among different
regions and age groups.
RESULTS: The HCV screening rate of inpatients was more than 50%. A total of
467,008 inpatients were enrolled in the study (51.20% were male), and the HCV
antibody (anti-HCV) -positive rate was 0.88% (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.85-0.91%) among the total population. This rate was significantly higher among 
all males compared with all females (0.91% vs 0.85%). Moreover, the HCV
antibody-positive rate increased with age and was highest for the 60-64-year age 
group. Notably, 90.14% (3722/4129) of the anti-HCV seropositive patients were
40 years of age or older. HCV screening for people over 40 years old is
recommended.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the key role of routine examination for HCV
infection in hospitalized patients. Full use of inpatient screening results to
manage HCV antibody-positive patients and a screening strategy targeting
inpatients 40 years and older were found to be low-cost and effective, which will
help to find the missing millions of yet unaware patients and also accelerate the
elimination of HCV in China.
