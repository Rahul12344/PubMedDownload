Viral diseases are a leading cause of worldwide yield losses in crop production. 
Breeding of resistance genes (R gene) into elite crop cultivars has been the
standard and most cost-effective practice. However, R gene-mediated resistance is
limited by the available R genes within genetic resources and in many cases, by
strain specificity. Therefore, it is important to generate new and broad-spectrum
antiviral strategies. The CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced
palindromic repeat, CRISPR-associated) editing system has been employed to confer
resistance to human viruses and several plant single-stranded DNA geminiviruses, 
pointing out the possible application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for virus
control. Here, we demonstrate that strong viral resistance to cauliflower mosaic 
virus (CaMV), a pararetrovirus with a double-stranded DNA genome, can be achieved
through Cas9-mediated multiplex targeting of the viral coat protein sequence. We 
further show that small interfering RNAs (siRNA) are produced and mostly map to
the 3' end of single-guide RNAs (sgRNA), although very low levels of siRNAs map
to the spacer region as well. However, these siRNAs are not responsible for the
inhibited CaMV infection because there is no resistance if Cas9 is not present.
We have also observed edited viruses in systematically infected leaves in some
transgenic plants, with short deletions or insertions consistent with
Cas9-induced DNA breaks at the sgRNA target sites in coat protein coding
sequence. These edited coat proteins, in most cases, led to earlier translation
stop and thus, nonfunctional coat proteins. We also recovered wild-type CP
sequence in these infected transgenic plants, suggesting these edited viral
genomes were packaged by wild-type coat proteins. Our data demonstrate that the
CRISPR-Cas9 system can be used for virus control against plant pararetroviruses
with further modifications.
