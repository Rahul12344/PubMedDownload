BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diagnostic values of FibroTest (FT) for hepatic fibrosis
have rarely been assessed in Asian chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. We aimed
to validate its diagnostic performances in comparison with liver stiffness (LS).
METHODS: From 2008 to 2010, 194 CHB patients who underwent liver biopsies along
with FT and transient elastography were prospectively enrolled. Fibrosis stage
was assessed according to the Batts and Ludwig system.
RESULTS: To predict significant fibrosis (F≥2), advanced fibrosis (F≥3), and
cirrhosis (F = 4), areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) 
of FT were 0.903, 0.907, and 0.866, comparable to those of LS (0.873, 0.897, and 
0.910, respectively). Optimized cutoffs of FT to maximize sum of sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.32, 0.52, and 0.68 for F≥2, F≥3, and F = 4, while those of LS 
were 8.8, 10.2, and 14.1 kPa, respectively. According to FT and LS cutoffs, 123
(63.4%) and 124 (63.9%) patients were correctly classified consistent with
histological fibrosis (F1, F2, F3, and F4), respectively. Overall concordance
between each fibrosis stage estimated by FT and LS was observed in 111 patients, 
where 88 were correctly classified with histological results. A combination
formula adding LS to FT (LS+FT) showed similar AUROC levels (0.885, 0.905, and
0.915), while another multiplying LS by FT (LS×FT) showed the best AUROCs (0.941,
0.931, and 0.929 for F≥2, F≥3, and F4, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: FT provides good fibrosis prediction, with comparable outcomes to LS
in Asian CHB patients. FT substantially reduces need for liver biopsy, especially
when used in combination with LS.
