A technique for isolation of RNA-ligase of bacteriophage T4 was proposed. It is
mainly based on the using of Soviet materials and sorbents and includes seven
purification stages. The technique enables to isolate about 80 000 units of
active enzyme from 100 g of E. coli B cells infected with the phage. T4am N82;
that makes up 20% of the activity of the cell extract. The obtained preparations 
of RNA-ligase are homogeneous by the data of electrophoresis and practically,
free of endo- and exonuclease admixtures.
