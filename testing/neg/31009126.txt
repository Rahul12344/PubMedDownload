Cessation of nucleos(t)ide analogue (Nuc) therapy in HBeAg-negative patients may 
increase HBsAg loss rate in patients with sustained remission (SR) and
non-retreated clinical relapsers (CR). To investigate and compare the HBsAg
kinetics from end of treatment (EOT) to HBsAg loss in these patients, serial
serum samples after EOT from 36 SR and 12 CR with HBsAg loss (study group) and an
1:1 matched control who remained HBsAg-seropositive (control group) were assayed 
retrospectively for quantitative HBsAg (qHBsAg). The results showed that study
group SR and CR had comparable EOT features except SR had lower EOT qHBsAg (67.5 
vs 350.5 IU/mL; P = 0.02; < 100 IU/mL: 58.3% vs 25%; P = 0.09). All showed
gradual qHBsAg decrease then "precipitous HBsAg decline" (>0.5 log10 IU/mL in
1 year) prior to HBsAg loss. Patients with EOT qHBsAg <100 showed earlier
(<12 months) "precipitous HBsAg decline" (91.7% vs 58.3%; P = 0.017) and sooner
HBsAg loss (5.5 vs 21.9 months; P = 0.026). The control group also showed gradual
qHBsAg decrease but less frequent "precipitous HBsAg decline" (39.6% vs 100%;
P < 0.001) which occurred later (15.1 vs 5.7 months; P = 0.003) and was less
steep (slope -0.6 vs -1.65 log10 IU/mL/year; P < 0.001). HBsAg loss was achieved 
in 92.9% of the patients with "precipitous HBsAg decline" >0.76 log10 IU/mL in
1 year. In conclusion, both the SR and CR groups showed gradual HBsAg decrease
followed by a "precipitous HBsAg decline", which is a prerequisite for HBsAg
loss. Lower EOT HBsAg in the SR group and qHBsAg <100 IU/mL may reflect better
immune control hence followed by sooner HBsAg loss.
