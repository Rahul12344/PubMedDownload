Exposure of infected CV-1 cells to specific type I and type II topoisomerase
poisons caused strong protein association with distinct subsets of simian virus
40 (SV40) DNA replication intermediates. On the basis of the known specificity
and mechanisms of action of these drugs, the proteins involved are assumed to be 
the respective topoisomerases. Camptothecin, a topoisomerase I poison, caused
strong protein association with form II (relaxed circular) and form III (linear) 
viral genomes and replication intermediates having broken DNA replication forks
but not with form I (superhelical) viral DNA or normal late replication
intermediates which were present. In contrast, type II topoisomerase poisons
caused completely replicated forms and late viral replication forms to be tightly
bound to protein--some to a greater extent than others. Different type II
topoisomerase inhibitors caused distinctive patterns of protein association with 
the replication intermediates present. Both intercalating and nonintercalating
type II topoisomerase poisons caused a small amount of form I (superhelical) SV40
DNA to be protein-associated in vivo. The protein complex with form I viral DNA
was entirely drug-dependent and strong, but apparently noncovalent. The protein
associated with form I DNA may represent a drug-stabilized "topological complex" 
between type II topoisomerase and SV40 DNA.
