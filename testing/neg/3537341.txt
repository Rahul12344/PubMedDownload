Prohead core of bacteriophage T4 can act as an intermediate in the T4 head
assembly pathway.

Kuhn A, Keller B, Maeder M, Traub F.

Bacteriophage T4 assembly was impaired in Escherichia coli hdB3-1 at an
incubation temperature below 30 degrees C. Naked prohead cores (head scaffold)
bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane accumulated, and the major
shell protein (gp23) precipitated into visible intracellular aggregates in the
cytoplasm. Shifting the temperature to 42 degrees C allowed newly synthesized
gp23 to assemble around the accumulated cores. We conclude that synchronous
assembly of the scaffold and shell is not obligatory and that naked cores can
serve as intermediates in the T4 assembly pathway.
