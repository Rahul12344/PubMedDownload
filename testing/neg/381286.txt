The properties of a bacteriophage T5 mutant unable to induce deoxyuridine
5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase. Synthesis of uracil-containing T5
deoxyribonucleic acid.

Bacteriophage T5 induces a deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase
(dUTPase) activity during infection of Escherichia coli. A T5 mutant (T5 dut)
unable to induce this dUTPase activity has been isolated. Although this mutant is
viable, the E. coli dUTPase activity is not sufficiently active to exclude uracil
from the progeny DNA and about 3% of the thymine is replaced by uracil. When the 
mutant is grown in an E. coli dut host about 12% of the thymine in the progeny
DNA is replaced by uracil. T5 phage containing 12% uracil can replicate in
uracil-DNA glycosylase-deficient (ung) hosts with high efficiency, but fail to
replicate in ung+ hosts. The amount of thymine replaced by uracil in the progeny 
produced in dut hosts is nearly independent of the ung genotype, indicating that 
the host uracil-DNA glycosylase-dependent repair pathway is not operating
efficiently to remove uracil from T5 progeny DNA.
