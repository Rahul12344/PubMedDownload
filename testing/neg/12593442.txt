A total of eighty six blood samples (17, 19 & 50 of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,
oesophageal cancer and normal healthy control respectively) were collected from
Naga Hospital, Kohima, Nagaland and B. Barooah Cancer Institute, Guwahati, Assam 
and were processed for the detection of EBV-IgG antibody using Elisa test. The
results showed that EBV positivity is higher among NPC patients as compared to
oesophageal carcinoma patients and/or healthy control. The data also indicated
that EBV antibody titre is significantly higher among NPC cases as compared to
control.
