Viruses of Entamoeba histolytica. 3. Properties of the polyhedral virus of the
HB-301 strain.

Some biological characteristics and bioassay of a polyhedral virus isolated from 
normal-appearing strain HB-301 of Entamoeba histolytica are described. The virus 
produced lysis of susceptible strains of E. histolytica, yet it caused no
cytopathological effect in the host strain, HB-301. The virus and host amoeba
existed in an equilibrium; approximately 10(4) mean infective dose units of virus
were produced per million HB-301 amoebae. Superinfection and antiviral antiserum 
treatment failed to disturb this equilibrium permanently. The mechanism of viral 
persistence in strain HB-301 amoebae remains to be determined. Purification of
the virus was attempted. Ninety-nine percent of the viral infectivity was
associated with a low-speed pellet which consisted of complexes of virus and
cellular membranes. Various treatments of this low-speed pellet failed to release
virus. Biologically active, membrane-free virus of low titer was prepared by
differential centrifugation of supernatant solutions and employed in electron
microscopy and other studies.
