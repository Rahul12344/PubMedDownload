DNA-dependent RNA-directed protein synthesis in vitro. IV. Peptide analysis of an
in vitro and in vivo phi X174 structural protein.

Gelfand DH, Hayashi M.

An antibody-precipitable structural protein from the bacteriophage varphiX174 was
purified from an in vitro protein-synthesizing system primed with the replicative
DNA of the virus. This protein was trypsin digested in the presence of the
differentially labeled analogous protein that was purified from the
bacteriophage. The tryptic hydrolysate was subjected to high resolution peptide
chromatography which revealed essentially identical patterns for the varphiX174
proteins synthesized in vitro and in vivo.
