Analyses of the complex regulatory networks leading to T cell survival, death,
and immune deficiency have been aided in the past year by the dramatic
development of new technologies to identify T cells and assess T cell function.
These new techniques have shown that functional inactivation and apoptotic
elimination of both virus-specific and non-virus-specific T cell populations mold
T cell responses to viral infections.
