We have developed an improved method for packaging adeno-associated virus (AAV)
vectors with a replication-defective adenovirus-AAV (Ad-AAV) hybrid virus. The
AAV vector encoding human acid alpha-glucosidase (hGAA) was cloned into an E1,
polymerase/preterminal protein-deleted adenovirus, such that it is packaged as an
Ad vector. Importantly, the Ad-AAV hybrid cannot replicate during AAV vector
packaging in 293 cells, because of deletion of polymerase/preterminal protein.
The residual Ad-AAV in the AAV vector stock was reduced to <1 infectious particle
per 10(10) AAV vector particles. These modifications resulted in approximately
30-fold increased packaging of the AAV vector for the hybrid Ad-AAV vector method
as compared with standard transfection-only methods. Similarly improved packaging
was demonstrated for pseudotyping the AAV vector as AAV6, and for AAV vector
packaging with a second Ad-AAV vector encoding canine glucose-6-phosphatase.
Liver-targeted delivery of either the Ad-AAV hybrid or AAV vector particles in
acid alpha-glucosidase-knockout (GAA-KO) mice revealed secretion of hGAA with the
Ad-AAV vector, and sustained secretion of hGAA with an AAV vector in
hGAA-tolerant GAA-KO mice. Further development of hybrid Ad-AAV vectors could
offer distinct advantages for gene therapy in glycogen storage diseases.
