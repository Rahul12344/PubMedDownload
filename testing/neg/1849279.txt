Antibody therapy holds great promise for the treatment of cancer, autoimmune
disorders, and viral infections. Murine monoclonal antibodies are relatively easy
to produce but are severely restricted for therapeutic use by their
immunogenicity in humans. Production of human monoclonal antibodies has been
problematic. Humanized antibodies can be generated by introducing the six
hypervariable regions from the heavy and light chains of a murine antibody into a
human framework sequence and combining it with human constant regions. We
humanized, with the aid of computer modeling, two murine monoclonal antibodies
against herpes simplex virus gB and gD glycoproteins. The binding, virus
neutralization, and cell protection results all indicate that both humanized
antibodies have retained the binding activities and the biological properties of 
the murine monoclonal antibodies.
