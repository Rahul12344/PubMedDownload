Glomerulonephritis (GN) is an uncommon but well-described complication of chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV-related membranous nephropathy (MN) may
lead to renal failure in 1/3 of the patients and spontaneous remission is rare.
There is no standard therapy for HBV-associated MN. We report a case of a
28-year-old man with HBV-associated MN due to pre-core HBV mutant with complete
remission under an ongoing 7-year lamivudine monotherapy.
