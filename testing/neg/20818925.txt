OBJECTIVE: Rotavirus is a common infection affecting children under 5 years,
which leads to a significant disease burden. This burden is potentially
exacerbated by the seasonality of rotavirus, particularly in the context of the
seasonality of other common childhood infections. The primary study objective was
to describe the pattern and burden of seasonal infections amongst children under 
5 years of age with particular attention placed on rotavirus and other
gastrointestinal infections.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all routine inpatient data relating to
selected seasonal infections in the UK was conducted between 2001/02 and 2007/08 
using data from Capse Healthcare Knowledge Systems (CHKS, England, Northern
Ireland and Wales) and Information Services Division (ISD, Scotland). Admissions 
with selected diagnoses were extracted based on International Classification of
Diseases (ICD)-10 coding. All episodes were processed using a HRG grouper and
costs applied according to the NHS National Tariff.
RESULTS: In the financial year 2007/08, the total number of admissions in the UK 
for children under 5 years for the selected seasonal infections was 64,879 of
which 32,126 admissions were associated with gastrointestinal infections
including rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE). Seasonal peaks of gastrointestinal
infections and RVGE occurred in the spring quarter and respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) and influenza in the winter quarter. Admissions for gastrointestinal 
infection including RVGE accounted for 35 003 bed days with 9922 due to RVGE. The
total cost for admissions involving a diagnosis of seasonal infection was £56
million. Of this, it was estimated that infections with an ICD-10 classification 
of rotavirus represented a cost of £8.6 million.
CONCLUSION: Rotavirus contributes to the significant burden that seasonal
infections place on inpatient paediatric resources during the winter and spring
months. This study may be limited by issues of clinical coding and the
infrequency of confirmatory microbiological testing in real-world practice.
Vaccination might be considered as a means of reducing this clinical and economic
burden particularly where long-term effectiveness and ease of administration are 
proven.
