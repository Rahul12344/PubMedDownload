OBJECTIVE: To explore the genotype distribution of high-risk human papillomavirus
(HR-HPV) and its attribution to different grades of cervical lesions in rural
China, which will contribute to type-specific HPV screening tests and the
development of new polyvalent HPV vaccines among the Chinese population.
METHODS: One thousand two hundred ninety-two subjects were followed based on the 
Shanxi Province Cervical Cancer Screening Study I (SPOCCS-I), and screened by HPV
DNA testing (hybrid capture® 2 [HC2]), liquid-based cytology (LBC), and if
necessary, directed or random colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies. HPV genotyping
with linear inverse probe hybridization (SPF10-PCR-LiPA) was performed in HC2
positive specimens. Attribution of specific HR-HPV type to different grades of
cervical lesions was estimated using a fractional contribution approach.
RESULTS: After excluding incomplete data, 1,274 women were included in the final 
statistical analysis. Fifteen point two percent (194/1,274) of women were HR-HPV 
positive for any of 13 HR-HPV types (HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56,
58, 59, and 68) and the most common HR-HPV types were HPV16 (19.1%) and HPV52
(16.5%). The genotypes most frequently detected in HR-HPV-positive cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (CIN1) were HPV52 (24.1%), HPV31 (20.7%), HPV16
(13.8%), HPV33 (13.8%), HPV39 (10.3%), and HPV56 (10.3%); in HR-HPV-positive
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+): HPV16 (53.1%), HPV58
(15.6%), HPV33 (12.5%), HPV51 (9.4%), and HPV52 (6.3%). HPV52, 31, 16, 33, 39,
and 56 together contributed to 89.7% of HR-HPV-positive CIN1, and HPV16, 33, 58, 
51, and 52 together contributed to 87.5% of CIN2+.
CONCLUSION: In summary, we found substantial differences in prevalence and
attribution of CINs between different oncogenic HPV types in a rural Chinese
population, especially for HPV16, 31, 33, 52, and 58. These differences may be
relevant for both clinical management and the design of preventive strategies.
