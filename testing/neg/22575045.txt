This experiment was conducted to study the antiviral activities of sodium
tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) against porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus (PRRSV) and its mechanism. Anti-PRRSV activities of STS were
observed on Marc-145 cells by using visualization of cytopathologic effect assay 
and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test, and 
its antiviral mechanism was determined by time-of-addition assay, adsorption
inhibition assay, and virucidal assay. The results showed that STS could reduce
the damage of PRRSV to Marc-145 cells, with the inhibition ratio exceeding to
100%, at the maximum non-cytotoxic concentration. The time-of-addition and
virucidal assays indicated that the anti-PRRSV activities of STS could be due to 
inhibiting the virus replication or/and inactivating the virus directly. The
inhibition of the virus attachment was not discovered in adsorption inhibition
assay. The results proved that STS had strong anti-PRRSV activity and encouraged 
for further exploration of STS.
