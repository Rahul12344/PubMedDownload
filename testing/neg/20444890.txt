Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is the most aggressive skin cancer. Recently, it was 
demonstrated that human Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) is clonally integrated in 
approximately 80% of MCC tumors. However, direct evidence for whether oncogenic
viral proteins are needed for the maintenance of MCC cells is still missing. To
address this question, we knocked down MCV T-antigen (TA) expression in
MCV-positive MCC cell lines using three different short hairpin RNA
(shRNA)-expressing vectors targeting exon 1 of the TAs. The MCC cell lines used
include three newly generated MCV-infected cell lines and one MCV-negative cell
line from MCC tumors. Notably, all MCV-positive MCC cell lines underwent growth
arrest and/or cell death upon TA knockdown, whereas the proliferation of
MCV-negative cell lines remained unaffected. Despite an increase in the number of
annexin V-positive, 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD)-negative cells upon TA
knockdown, activation of caspases or changes in the expression and
phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family members were not consistently detected after TA
suppression. Our study provides the first direct experimental evidence that TA
expression is necessary for the maintenance of MCV-positive MCC and that MCV is
the infectious cause of MCV-positive MCC.
