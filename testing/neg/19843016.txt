PURPOSE: The aetiology of the apparently vasoocclusive phenomena in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related retinopathy is not well understood. Several 
hypotheses, including infectious damage of the retinal vasculature and altered
retinal haemodynamics, have been postulated. Direct measurement of oxygen tension
in the retina is not possible in vivo and indirect methods have to be employed.
The objective of this study was to investigate the retinal vascular response to
100% oxygen breathing in patients with HIV.
METHODS: Twelve patients infected with HIV and 12 healthy individuals, matched
for age, sex and smoking habits, were studied in an open study using the
blue-field entoptic technique for the measurement of retinal white blood cell
(WBC) flux. Reactivity in retinal blood flow during 100% O(2) breathing over 15
min was measured and expressed as percentage change over baseline.
RESULTS: WBC velocity during oxygen inhalation decreased over baseline by 9.0 ±
5.8% in HIV-infected patients and by 18.6 ± 5.4% in healthy participants (p <
0.04 between groups, ANOVA). The decrease in WBC velocity was paralleled by a
decrease in WBC density. This decrease tended to be more pronounced in healthy
participants (13.6 ± 7.9%) than in HIV-infected patients (8.0 ± 10.8%), but the
difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.1 between groups, ANOVA). WBC
flux decrease was 16.2 ± 11.4% in HIV-infected patients and 29.5 ± 9.5% in the
control group and was significant between groups (p = 0.007 between groups,
ANOVA).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a reduced reactivity of WBC flux to systemic
hyperoxia in patients with HIV. Whether abnormal retinal haemodynamics in
HIV-infected persons contributes to the pathogenesis of HIV-related microvascular
diseases or is a consequence of the structural changes associated with the
disease is unknown.
