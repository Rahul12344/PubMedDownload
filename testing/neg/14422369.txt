Epidemiology of the arthropod-borne encephalitides.

MILES JA.

Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an
epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by
arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in
domestic animals or man have been discovered. The author reviews here the
knowledge at present available on these viruses, originally termed
"arthropod-borne encephalitides viruses" but now often referred to as "arbor
viruses".In this discussion of the host and vector relationships of the two broad
groups of arbor viruses - the mosquito-borne and the tick-borne-and of the
distribution, epidemiology and control of the various diseases they cause, the
author includes an outline of the types of investigation likely to provide the
most useful information, stressing in this connexion the value of ecological
surveys.
