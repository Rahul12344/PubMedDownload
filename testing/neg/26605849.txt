function with gene therapy.

Restored rod visual function after gene therapy can be established unequivocally 
by demonstrating that, after dark adaptation, spectral sensitivity has the shape 
characteristic of rods and that this shape collapses to a cone-like shape before 
rods have recovered after an intense bleach. We used these tests to assess
retinal function in eight young adults and children with early-onset severe
retinal dystrophy from Phase II of a clinical gene-therapy trial for RPE65
deficiency that involved the subretinal delivery of a recombinant
adeno-associated viral vector carrying RPE65. We found substantial improvements
in rod sensitivity in two participants: dark-adapted spectral sensitivity was
rod-like after treatment and was cone-like before rods had recovered after a
bleach. After 40 min of dark adaptation, one participant showed up to 1,000-fold 
sensitivity improvements 4 months after treatment and the second up to 100-fold
improvements 6 months after treatment. The dark-adapted spectral sensitivities of
the other six participants remained cone-like and showed little improvement in
sensitivity.
