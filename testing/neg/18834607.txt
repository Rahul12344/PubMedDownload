Hantaan virus (HTNV) is a pathogenic hantavirus that causes hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS). HTNV infection is mediated by alpha v beta3 integrin.
We used protein blots of Vero E6 cell homogenates to demonstrate that
radiolabeled HTNV virions bind to gC1qR/p32, the acidic 32-kDa protein known as
the receptor for the globular head domain of complement C1q. RNAi-mediated
suppression of gC1qR/p32 markedly reduced HTNV binding and infection in human
lung epithelial A549 cells. Conversely, transient expression of either simian or 
human gC1qR/p32 rendered non-permissive CHO cells susceptible to HTNV infection. 
These results suggest an important role for gC1qR/p32 in HTNV infection and
pathogenesis.
