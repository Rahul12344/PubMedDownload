Influenza vaccinations were performed either by administration of a bivalent A2 +
B vaccine, or by successive application of monovalent B and A2 vaccines. During
an influenza epidemic caused by an A2 strain, the following observations could be
made: a) the best efficiency (no influenza cases) was recorded in adults and aged
persons (over 65 years) irrespective of the vaccination scheme; b) in
schoolchildren the best results (no influenza cases) were obtained in the lot
having received monovalent A2 vaccine, and in the lot vaccinated nasally with
monovalent B vaccine and 14 days later with monovalent A vaccine.
