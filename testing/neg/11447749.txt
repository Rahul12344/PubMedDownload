Although the clinical course of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenström
macroglobulinemia (WM) is usually indolent, high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma may
develop in a small subset of patients. We have not found any patients with LPL/WM
associated with Hodgkin disease (HD) described in the literature, prompting us to
report 2 cases. In case 1, the patient had LPL/WM involving bone marrow diagnosed
1 week before left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy revealed LPL/WM and
classical HD. In case 2, the patient had a 15-year history of LPL/WM before
classical HD developed involving bone marrow, liver, and lymph node. Both cases
were positive for IgM, monotypic immunoglobulin light chain, and B-cell antigens 
and were CD3-. The neoplastic Hodgkin cells were CD15+, CD20+ (case 1), CD30+,
CD3-, and CD45- and were negative for Epstein-Barr virus RNA. Both patients were 
treated with chemotherapy for HD. In case 1, clinical response was excellent with
no histologic evidence of HD in subsequent biopsy specimens. In case 2, HD was
progressive at last follow-up, despite therapy. Patients with LPL/WM, similar to 
patients with other types of low-grade B-cell lymphoma, can develop HD that may
respond to chemotherapy.
