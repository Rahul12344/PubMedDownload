Is a cure for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection possible? Hepatitis C
virus infection is now routinely cured medically. There is a growing expectation 
that new drugs for the management of chronic HBV infection should provide
substantial benefit over and above that of current chronic HBV medications, if
not be curative. Although the definition of medically induced cure for chronic
HBV infection varies, most include sustained off-drug absence of viremia and
negativity for other virologic markers. There are currently more than 29 drugs in
the pipeline being tested for the management of chronic HBV infection. This
article discusses the potential drugs with respect to their possible
contributions to achieving medically induced cure.
