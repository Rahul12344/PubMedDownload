Acute encephalopathy was associated with the appearance of antibodies to human
T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-III) in two patients. A third patient showed
seroconversion for anti-HTLV-III, but the temporal association was not
established so precisely. The illness was characterised by a prodromal period of 
up to 2 weeks, characterised by pyrexia, general malaise, and changes of mood.
The encephalopathy culminated in epileptiform seizures in two of the patients.
Electroencephalographic changes were compatible with viral encephalitis, and
cerebrospinal-fluid pleocytosis was minimal. Neurological signs and symptoms
resolved quickly in all patients, and no residual central-nervous-system sequelae
were apparent.
