glycoprotein critical for interaction with the CD4 receptor.

The primary event in the infection of cells by HIV is the interaction between the
viral envelope glycoprotein, gp120, and its cellular receptor, CD4. A recombinant
form of gp120 was found to bind to a recombinant CD4 antigen with high affinity. 
Two gp120-specific murine monoclonal antibodies were able to block the
interaction between gp120 and CD4. The gp120 epitope of one of these antibodies
was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography of acid-cleaved gp120 and shown to 
be contained within amino acids 397-439. Using in vitro mutagenesis, we have
found that deletion of 12 amino acids from this region of gp120 leads to a
complete loss of binding. In addition, a single amino acid substitution in this
region results in significantly decreased binding, suggesting that sequences
within this region are directly involved in the binding of gp120 to the CD4
receptor.
