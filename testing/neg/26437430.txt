Chromatin influences Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) integration and
replication. This review highlights critical host factors that influence
chromatin structure and organization and that also impact HIV integration,
transcriptional regulation and latency. Furthermore, recent attempts to target
chromatin associated factors to reduce the HIV proviral load are discussed.
