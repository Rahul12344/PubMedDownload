OBJECTIVE: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2-3 (CIN2-3) are usually
treated by cone excision, although only 30% progress to cancer and 6-50% regress 
spontaneously. Biomarkers predicting CIN2-3 regression would be of great clinical
value and could reduce unnecessary cone excision and associated complications.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether punch-biopsy derived
immunohistochemical biomarkers, local immune response, CIN lesion size and condom
use are independently correlated to regression of CIN2-3.
METHODS: A prospective population-based cohort study of 162 women aged 25-40,
with first-time onset diagnosis of CIN2-3 in colposcopy-directed biopsies was
carried out. The median biopsy-cone interval was 16 weeks. Regression was defined
as CIN1 or less in the cone biopsy.
RESULTS: The regression rate was 21% (34/162). pRb>30% in the lower epithelial
half was the strongest predictor for regression (30% regression, p<0.0001). If
additionally a CIN-lesion was smaller than 2.5mm and CD4+ lymphoid cells in the
subepithelial stroma ≤ 195 per 1.04 mm basal membrane, the regression rate was
53%. In CIN-lesions>2.5mm and CD4+-stroma ≤195, consistent condom use increased
the regression rate from 13% to 67% (p=0.003). If pRb was ≤30%, the regression
rate was low (6%).
CONCLUSION: Biomarkers and CIN lesion length can predict CIN2-3 regression, and
might be helpful to identify patients who can increase the regression rate of CIN
lesions by consistent condom use.
