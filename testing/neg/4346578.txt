Efficacy of whooping-cough vaccines used in the United Kingdom before 1968.

[No authors listed]

The efficacy of pertussis vaccines was investigated in 33 areas in the United
Kingdom from November 1966 until April 1968 inclusive. Bordetella pertussis was
isolated from 1,293 persons, but there were only six isolations of B.
papapertussis. Among vaccinated contacts under 5 years in homes in which B.
pertussis was isolated 52% developed paroxysmal cough. The corresponding attack
rate among unvaccinated contacts was 69%. These findings suggest that much of the
pertussis vaccine in use for five or six years before 1968 was not very
effective. However, vaccine from one producer was more effective than vaccine
from another. Of the cultures of B. pertussis identified 89% were serotype 1, 3
and only about 9% were serotype 1, 2, 3. Serotype 1, 2, 3 was isolated much more 
frequently from unvaccinated than from vaccinated children, but some cultures
identified as type 1, 2, 3 were found on re-examination to contain colonies of
type 1, 3. Virological investigations were made in some areas during the first
year of the study. Of the wide variety of viruses identified adenovirus and
parainfluenza virus were the most common groups. Virus isolation rates were
similar in patients and symptomless contacts, but B. pertussis was isolated far
more often from patients than from symptomless contacts. The evidence suggests
that B. pertussis remained the major cause of whooping cough in the U.K.
