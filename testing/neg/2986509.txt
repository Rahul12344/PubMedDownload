NIH conference. The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: an update.

Fauci AS, Masur H, Gelmann EP, Markham PD, Hahn BH, Lane HC.

The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome continues to be a major public health
problem in the United States, and recently its spread worldwide has accelerated. 
The syndrome is caused by a human retrovirus transmitted by sexual contact and
via blood or blood products. The virus has been isolated, characterized, and
cloned, and in addition to its presence in blood, it has been found in body
tissues and fluids including brain, semen, and saliva. Although the syndrome in
the United States is still largely confined to male homosexuals and intravenous
drug users, there is increasing evidence, particularly from Zaire, that the virus
can be spread by heterosexual contact. Attempts at immune reconstitution with
lymphocytes and lymphokines have resulted in some transient improvement in immune
function but without clinical effect, indicating the need for specific
anti-retroviral therapy in combination with immune reconstitution.
