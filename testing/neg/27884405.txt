Zika virus (ZIKV) persists in the semen of male patients, a first for flavivirus 
infection. Here, we demonstrate that ZIKV can induce inflammation in the testis
and epididymidis, but not in the prostate or seminal vesicle, and can lead to
damaged testes after 60 days post-infection in mice. ZIKV induces innate immune
responses in Leydig, Sertoli, and epididymal epithelial cells, resulting in the
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. However, ZIKV does not
induce a rapid and abundant cytokine production in peritubular cell and
spermatogonia, suggesting that these cells are vulnerable for ZIKV infection and 
could be the potential repositories for ZIKV. Our study demonstrates a
correlation between ZIKV and testis infection/damage and suggests that ZIKV
infection, under certain circumstances, can eventually lead to male infertility.
