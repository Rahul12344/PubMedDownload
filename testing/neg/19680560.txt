Highly pathogenic influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 proved to be remarkably mobile in 
migratory bird populations where it has led to extensive outbreaks for which the 
true number of affected birds usually cannot be determined. For the evaluation of
avian influenza monitoring and HPAIV early warning systems, we propose a
time-series analysis that includes the estimation of confidence intervals for (i)
the prevalence in outbreak situations or (ii) in the apparent absence of disease 
in time intervals for specified regional units. For the German outbreak regions
in 2006 and 2007, the upper 95% confidence limit allowed the detection of
prevalences below 1% only for certain time intervals. Although more than 25,000
birds were sampled in Germany per year, the upper 95% confidence limit did not
fall below 5% in the outbreak regions for most of the time. The proposed analysis
can be used to monitor water bodies and high risk areas, also as part of an
early-warning system. Chances for an improved targeting of the monitoring system 
as part of a risk-based approach are discussed with the perspective of reducing
sample sizes.
