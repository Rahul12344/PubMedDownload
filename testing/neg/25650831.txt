Systemic necrosis is one of the most severe symptoms caused by plant RNA viruses.
Recently, systemic necrosis has been suggested to have similar features to a
defense response referred to as the hypersensitive response (HR), a form of
programmed cell death. In virus-infected plant cells, host intracellular membrane
structures are changed dramatically for more efficient viral replication.
However, little is known about whether this replication-associated membrane
modification is the cause of the symptoms. In this study, we identified an
amino-terminal amphipathic helix of the helicase encoded by Radish mosaic virus
(RaMV) (genus Comovirus) as an elicitor of cell death in RaMV-infected plants.
Cell death caused by the amphipathic helix had features similar to HR, such as
SGT1-dependence. Mutational analyses and inhibitor assays using cerulenin
demonstrated that the amphipathic helix-induced cell death was tightly correlated
with dramatic alterations in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane structures.
Furthermore, the cell death-inducing activity of the amphipathic helix was
conserved in Cowpea mosaic virus (genus Comovirus) and Tobacco ringspot virus
(genus Nepovirus), both of which are classified in the family Secoviridae.
Together, these results indicate that ER membrane modification associated with
viral intracellular replication may be recognized to prime defense responses
against plant viruses.
