OBJECTIVES: The nephrotoxicity of cadmium at low levels of exposure, measured by 
urinary cadmium, has recently been questioned since co-excretion of cadmium and
proteins may have causes other than cadmium toxicity. The aim of this study was
to explore the relation between kidney function and low or moderate cadmium
levels, measured directly in kidney biopsies.
METHODS: We analysed cadmium in kidney biopsies (K-Cd), blood (B-Cd) and urine
(U-Cd) from 109 living kidney donors in a cross-sectional study. We measured
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), cystatin C in serum, albumin, β-2-microglobulin
(B2M), retinol-binding protein (RBP), α-1-microglobulin (A1M),
N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) in 24 h and
overnight urine.
RESULTS: We found significant positive associations between A1M excretion and
K-Cd in multiple regression models including age, sex, weight, smoking and
urinary flow rate. This association was also present in never-smokers. A1M was
also positively associated with B-Cd and U-Cd. GFR and the other biomarkers of
kidney function were not associated with K-Cd. GFR estimated from serum cystatin 
C showed a very poor correlation with measured GFR. KIM-1, RBP and possibly
albumin were positively associated with U-Cd, but only in overnight urine. No
associations were found with B2M.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that A1M in urine is a sensitive biomarker for
effects of low-level cadmium exposure. A few associations between other renal
biomarkers and U-Cd, but not K-Cd, were probably caused by physiological
co-excretion or chance.
