Barley stripe mosaic virions assoicated with spindle microtubules.

Mayhew DE, Carrol TW.

Virions of barley stripe mosaic virus were observed attached to microtubules of
the spindle apparatus. This phenomenon was found in barley cells undergoing
meiosis and mitosis. The microtubules may be involved in the assembly and
cell-to-cell transfer of the virus.
