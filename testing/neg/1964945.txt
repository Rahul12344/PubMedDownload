A method is described for the identification of type A and type B isolates of
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by means of the polymerase chain reaction. The use of
three pairs of primers specific for genomic sequences coding for the two forms of
EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), 2A and 2B, and for a DNA sequence from the BamZ/BamR 
region allows the reliable and rapid detection of type A and B viruses in as
little as 1000 EBV positive cells.
