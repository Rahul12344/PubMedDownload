in insect cells and functional analysis of expression products].

Steroid 21-hydroxylase is a key enzyme of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
biosynthesis in the adrenal gland that belongs to the family of microsomal
cytochrome P450. The steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most frequent cause
of the congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The human steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21 A)
and its mutant variant (C 169R) found previously in patient with the classical
congenital adrenal hyperplasia were synthesized for the first time in the insect 
cell lines Sf9 and Hi5 infected by recombinant baculoviruses. Under optimal
conditions the level of CYP21A2 production in insect cells achieves 28% of the
total microsomal protein. C169R mutation does not effect the synthesis of CYP21
A2 in insect cells and does not prevent the incorporation of the enzyme into the 
membranes of endoplasmic reticulum. Functional analysis of the mutant enzyme in
vitro suggested the virtually complete lack of catalytic activity towards two
substrates - progesterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
