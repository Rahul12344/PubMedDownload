The effect of interferon on chicken spleen lymphocytes.

Bakay M, Taródi B, Prágai B, Béládi I.

The inhibitory activity of chicken interferon has been investigated on
phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced DNA synthesis of chicken spleen lymphocytes
inoculated with type 12 adenovirus and was purified by selective adsorption on
Na-Al-silicate. As a control, the culture fluid of chicken leukocytes purified in
the same manner was used. In some instances the control preparation also showed a
slight inhibitory effect. To prove that the immunosuppressive activity of our
interferon preparation was indeed due to its interferon content both the
interferon and the control preparation were purified further by chromatography on
Sephadex G 100 superfine gel. Only the fractions with antiviral activity of
interferon preparation inhibited the PHA-response of the lymphocytes. The
fractions with the same molecular weight of control preparation were without
effect.
