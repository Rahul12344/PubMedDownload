Evidence for frequent lysogeny in lactobacilli: temperate bacteriophages within
the subgenus Streptobacterium.

Stetter KO.

A total of 17 of 21 Lactobacillus strains of the subgenus Streptobacterium were
lysogenic. Two different temperate phages isolated from such lysogens are very
similar to Lactobacillus casei phage PL-1. The narrow host range of bacteriophage
PL-1 appears to be caused by homoimmunity.
