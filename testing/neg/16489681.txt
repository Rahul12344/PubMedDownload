AIM: To assess the three polymorphism regions within cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
antigen 4 (CTLA-4) gene, a C/T base exchange in the promoter region -318 (CTLA-4 
-318C/T), an A/G substitution in the exon 1 position 49 (CTLA-4 49A/G), a T/C
substitution in 1172 (CTLA-4 -1172T/C) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
METHODS: Fifty-one patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and 150
healthy subjects were recruited sequentially as they presented to the hepatic
clinic. Classification of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients was
as asymptomatic carrier state (26 patients) and chronic hepatitis B (25
patients). Genomic DNA was isolated from anti-coagulated peripheral blood Buffy
coat using Milleros salting-out method. The presence of the CTLA-4 gene
polymorphisms was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification
refractory mutation system (ARMS).
RESULTS: We observed a significant association between -318 genotypes frequency
(T+C-, T+C+, T-C+) and susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B (P=0.012, OR=0.49,
95%CI: 0.206-1.162). However, we did not observe a significant association for
+49 genotype frequency (T+C+, T+C- T-C+) and -1172 genotype frequency (C+T+, T+C-
C+T-) and state of disease.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms may partially be
involved in the susceptibility to chronic hepatitis B.
