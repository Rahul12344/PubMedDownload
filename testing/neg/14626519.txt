Herpesviruses in the alpha group--HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV (i.e., HSV-3)--are
ubiquitous in American society. HSV-1 is associated primarily with herpes
labialis, while HSV-2 is involved in about 70% of cases of genital herpes.
Varicellazoster virus causes chickenpox in unvaccinated children and others, and 
latent virus produces shingles later in life. Since many patients with HSV-1 and 
HSV-2 infections are asymptomatic, testing is important in determining presence
of the viruses. Several antiviral agents effective against HSV have been
marketed. While the infection cannot be cured, the available medications are
effective for reducing the duration of outbreaks, recurrences, and possibly viral
transmission.
