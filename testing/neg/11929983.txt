Packaging of cyclophilin A (CypA) into HIV-1 virions is essential for efficient
replication; however, the reason for this is unknown. Incorporation is mediated
through binding to the Gly-89-Pro-90 peptide bond of the N-terminal domain of
HIV-1 capsid (CA(N)). Despite the fact that CypA is a peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans
isomerase, catalytic activity on CA(N) has not been observed previously. We show 
here, using NMR exchange spectroscopy, that CypA does not only bind to CA(N) but 
also catalyzes efficiently the cis/trans isomerization of the Gly-89-Pro-90
peptide bond. In addition, conformational changes in CA(N) distal to the CypA
binding loop are observed on CypA binding and catalysis. The results provide
experimental evidence for efficient CypA catalysis on a natively folded and
biologically relevant protein substrate.
