There is no approved therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after kidney
transplantation, and no data regarding the use of new-generation direct antiviral
agents (DAAs) have been published so far. The aims of this pilot study were to
assess the efficacy and safety of an interferon-free sofosbuvir-based regimen to 
treat chronic HCV infection in kidney transplant recipients. Twenty-five kidney
transplant recipients with chronic HCV infection were given, for 12 (n = 19) or
24 weeks (n = 6), sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (n = 3); sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir 
(n = 4); sofosbuvir plus simeprevir, with (n = 1) or without ribavirin (n = 6);
sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir, with (n = 1) or without ribavirin (n = 9); and
sofosbuvir plus pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (n = 1). A rapid virological 
response, defined by undetectable viremia at week 4 after starting DAA therapy,
was observed in 22 of the 25 patients (88%). At the end of therapy, HCV RNA was
undetectable in all patients. At 4 and 12 weeks after completing DAA therapy, all
had a sustained virological response. The tolerance to anti-HCV therapy was
excellent and no adverse event was observed. A significant decrease in
calcineurin inhibitor levels was observed after HCV clearance. New-generation
oral DAAs are efficient and safe to treat HCV infection after kidney
transplantation.
