The effect of tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) on
enhancer dependent polyomavirus (Py) DNA replication was examined in cells
expressing Py large T antigen. The results showed that TPA enhanced Py DNA
replication by stimulating the activity of the A element, one of the two cores of
Py enhancer. Of the three subdomains of the A element, the biding sites of PEBP1 
(PEA1), a member of AP1 family, and of PEBP5 were by themselves able to activate 
Py DNA replication. Furthermore, each binding site of PEBP1 and PEBP5 responded
to TPA to enhance Py DNA replication. The results suggest that growth promoting
signals could activate DNA replication directly via enhancer binding proteins.
