Adenovirus-induced liver pathology is mediated through TNF receptors I and II but
is independent of TNF or lymphotoxin.

Mice infected with an adenovirus mutant in which the E3 region is deleted,
including TNF-resistance genes, develop fatal liver pathology within 3-4 days
after infection. At least 10-fold more wild-type virus was needed to cause
comparable pathology. These results indicate that the E3 region is critically
involved in modulating the pathogenesis of adenovirus infection and that TNF may 
play a role in liver damage. To explore the latter possibility, the course of
disease was examined in infected mice lacking TNFR-I and/or TNFRII, TNF only, or 
both TNF and lymphotoxin-alpha. Only mice lacking both TNFRI and TNFRII were
protected from the lethal affects of the mutant adenovirus. Mice deficient in TNF
or TNF and lymphotoxin-alpha displayed the fatal pathology. This outcome is
consistent with the existence of another related ligand that binds TNFRI/II to
mediate liver damage during infection with this mutant.
