Study Objectives: Zika virus infection during pregnancy may result in congenital 
Zika syndrome (CZS), whose characteristics are being described.
Methods: The present study aimed to investigate the sleep characteristics of 136 
infants/toddlers (88 with CZS and 48 with typical development (TD), age and
gender matched, 60% girls and 40% boys in both groups) using the Brief Infant
Sleep Questionnaire. The ages of children in both groups ranged from 5 to 24
months (CZS 15.9 ± 0.4 vs. TD 15.8 ± 1.0 months, P= 0.90).
Results: The results show that 34.1% of CZS and 2% of TD children were defined as
poor sleepers, 15% of CZS and 2% of TD children remained awake at night for a
period longer than 1 hour, and 24% of CZS and 2% of TD children slept less than 9
hours. The CZS group showed shorter total sleep time (CZS 11.24 ± 2.6 vs. TD
12.02 ± 1.9 hours, P= 0.03) and shorter nocturnal sleep duration than the TD
group (CZS 8.2 ± 0.2 vs. TD 9.4 ± 0.2 hours, P= 0.0002). In contrast to the
control group (P= 0.02, r= -0.34), in the CZS group, no correlation was found
between age and nocturnal wakefulness. Future studies should explore these data
in relation to the development and maturation of the central nervous system of
these children.
Conclusions: Considering the well-known consequences of poor sleep quality on
health in several populations, the presence of sleep disorders should be
considered in CZS using multidisciplinary treatments.
