Solid phase cytometry would be an asset for many histological and cytological
studies. Current microscope-based cytometers and image analysis systems are too
slow to analyze specimens several millimeters wide. We have recently shown that a
rapid wide area laser scanning device that operates on solid supports has a
linear response. We assess it here for solid phase cytometry. Each cell detected 
by the cytometer can be automatically positioned for visual observation in the
field of an epifluorescence microscope (conventional or confocal) in which the
stage is driven by the instrument's computer. We were able to detect and map
human papillomavirus-infected cells labeled by fluorescent in situ hybridization 
in cervical condyloma biopsies. We could quantify the fluorescence emitted by
these cells and show differences of up to 35-fold in fluorescence intensity
between individual cells. These differences in intensity might reflect
differences in viral copy number. The potential of the system to provide fast,
reliable and reproducible analyses of solid tissue samples is discussed.
