This study was designed to understand the effects of the interspecific
competition between red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren and two
native ant species, Pheidole fervens Smith and Monomorium chinense Santschi, by
conducting colony interference and individual confrontation tests under
laboratory conditions. The colony interference test showed that both native ant
species, owing to their numerical advantage, killed the Solenopsis invicta
virus-1 (SINV-1)-infected or healthy queens of S. invicta. Significantly less
time was required for M. chinense to kill all SINV-1-infected S. invicta compared
with the time required to kill the healthy S. invicta. Compared with healthy S.
invicta, SINV-1-infected S. invicta spent a longer time eliminating the P.
fervens colonies. In confrontation tests, M. chinense killed a significantly
higher number of infected S. invicta minors than they did healthy minors, but the
number of S. invicta majors (either infected or healthy) killed was substantially
less. This study found that the viral infection weakened the competitive ability 
of S. invicta and made them prone to be eliminated by M. chinense but not by P.
fervens.
