OBJECTIVES: To estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2007-2008
season and assess the sentinel surveillance system in Canada for monitoring virus
evolution and impact on VE.
METHODS: Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and epidemiologic details were collected from
patients presenting to a sentinel physician within 7 days of influenza-like
illness onset. Cases tested positive for influenza A/B virus by real-time
polymerase chain reaction; controls tested negative. Hemagglutination inhibition 
(HI) and gene sequencing explored virus relatedness to vaccine. VE was calculated
as 1 minus the odds ratio for influenza in vaccinated versus nonvaccinated
participants, with adjustment for confounders.
RESULTS: Of 1425 participants, 21% were vaccinated. Influenza virus was detected 
in 689 (48%), of which isolates from 663 were typed/subtyped: 189 (29%) were
A/H1, 210 (32%) were A/H3, and 264 (40%) were B. Of A/H1N1 isolates, 6% showed
minor HI antigenic mismatch to vaccine, with greater variation based on genetic
identity. All A/H3N2 isolates showed moderate antigenic mismatch, and 98% of
influenza B virus isolates showed major lineage-level mismatch to vaccine.
Adjusted VE for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B components was 69% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 44%-83%), 57% (95% CI, 32%-73%), and 55% (95% CI, 32%-70%), respectively,
with an overall VE of 60% (95% CI, 45%-71%).
CONCLUSIONS: Detailed antigenic and genotypic analysis of influenza viruses was
consistent with epidemiologic estimates of VE showing cross-protection. A routine
sentinel surveillance system that combines detailed virus and VE monitoring
annually, as modeled in Canada, may guide improved vaccine selection and
protection.
