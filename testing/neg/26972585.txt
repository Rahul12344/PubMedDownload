Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare and often aggressive T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma that has been linked to infection by the human T-cell
lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). ATLL can involve multiple organs including
the respiratory airway. A 53-year-old Trinidadian woman presented with productive
cough and progressive shortness of breath. Her past medical history included
duodenal strongyloidosis, skin rash, and hypercalcemia. Radiological studies
showed increased interstitial markings. Sputum cytology showed atypical
pleomorphic, small-to-medium-sized, lobated lymphocytes with irregular and
hyperchromatic nuclei resembling "flower cells" which were CD3±/CD20- by
immunocytochemistry. A lung biopsy showed interstitial, peribronchiolar, and
subpleural infiltration by a CD3±/CD25± atypical lymphocytic infiltrate. Together
with peripheral blood findings and positive HTLV-1 serology, the diagnosis of
ATLL was made. We suggest that sputum evaluation in patients with ATLL risk
factors can be diagnostic.
