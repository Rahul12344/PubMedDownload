Pathways in Hepatocytes.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes both acute and chronic liver injury.
Viral proteins are involved in the pathological progress. Hepatitis B core
antigen (HBcAg), a component of viral nucleocapsid, is not only essential for HBV
lifecycle, but also exhibits strong immunogenicity. The cytoplasmic location of
HBcAg in liver biopsy is associated with liver injury and inflammation, but the
exact mechanisms remain to be elaborated.
METHODS: Huh7, SMMC-7721 and L-02 cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1-HBcAg to
establish an intracellular HBcAg expression model. The mRNA and protein levels of
Interleukin (IL)-6 were detected by qPCR and ELISA respectively. The signaling
pathway-related proteins were investigated by western blot and immunofluorescence
assay.
RESULTS: HBcAg increased the expression and secretion of IL-6 through activating 
extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38 MAPK) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). These activations can be blocked
by specific inhibitors of the three pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: HBcAg actives p38, ERK1/2 and NF-κB to enhance the production of
IL-6 in hepatocytes. This provides a molecular mechanism to explain the
association of cytoplasmic HBcAg with severe liver injury and inflammation.
