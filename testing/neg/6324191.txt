Assembly in vitro of a spanning membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum:
the E1 glycoprotein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59.

Rottier P, Brandenburg D, Armstrong J, van der Zeijst B, Warren G.

The E1 glycoprotein of coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus A59 was synthesized in
vitro by translation of viral mRNA in the presence of dog pancreatic microsomes. 
Its disposition in the membrane was investigated by digestion with proteases and 
by selective NH2-terminal labeling. The protein spans the membrane, but only
small portions from the NH2 and COOH terminus are exposed respectively in the
lumenal and cytoplasmic domains; the bulk of the molecule is apparently buried in
the membrane. The protein lacks a cleavable leader sequence and does not acquire 
its characteristic O-linked oligosaccharides in rough microsomes. It may enter
the membrane at any stage during synthesis of the first 150 amino acid residues. 
These unusual features of the protein might help to explain why it is not
transported to the cell surface in vivo but remains in intracellular membranes,
causing the virus to bud there.
