Ramsay Hunt syndrome develops upon reactivation of a latent virus within the
geniculate ganglion. The patient presents with acute facial paralysis, severe ear
pain, and a vesicular eruption of the external auditory canal and concha.
Varicella zoster virus seropositivity occurs among approximately 90% of members
of society. In these persons, virus reactivation may occur especially with
advancing age and immunosuppression. We present a case of Ramsay Hunt syndrome
that developed in a 35-year-old male patient, who had undergone a renal
transplantation 8 months prior and had received maintenance immunosuppression.
