AIMS: Successive application of negative staining transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a new correlative 
approach that could be used to rapidly and specifically detect and identify
single pathogens including bioterrorism-relevant viruses in complex samples. Our 
objective is to evaluate the TERS-compatibility of commonly used electron
microscopy (EM) grids (sample supports), chemicals and negative staining
techniques and, if required, to devise appropriate alternatives.
METHODS AND RESULTS: While phosphortungstic acid (PTA) is suitable as a heavy
metal stain, uranyl acetate, paraformaldehyde in HEPES buffer and alcian blue are
unsuitable due to their relatively high Raman scattering. Moreover, the low
thermal stability of the carbon-coated pioloform film on copper grids (pioloform 
grids) negates their utilization. The silicon in the cantilever of the
silver-coated atomic force microscope tip used to record TERS spectra suggested
that Si-based grids might be employed as alternatives. From all evaluated
Si-based TEM grids, the silicon nitride (SiN) grid was found to be best suited,
with almost no background Raman signals in the relevant spectral range, a low
surface roughness and good particle adhesion properties that could be further
improved by glow discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Charged SiN grids have excellent particle adhesion properties. The
use of these grids in combination with PTA for contrast in the TEM is suitable
for subsequent analysis by TERS.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study reports fundamental modifications
and optimizations of the negative staining EM method that allows a combination
with near-field Raman spectroscopy to acquire a spectroscopic signature from
nanoscale biological structures. This should facilitate a more precise diagnosis 
of single viral particles and other micro-organisms previously localized and
visualized in the TEM.
