The isolation of a retrovirus from peripheral blood lymphocytes/monocytes can be 
a difficult task, requiring the fulfillment of three essential parameters. First,
this viral agent must infect such cells in vivo. Second, these circulating cells 
should harbor wild-type proviruses. Finally, the viral agent has to express, at
least when these cells are cultured in vitro, the structural proteins necessary
for the production of viral particles. Foamy viruses (FVs), also known as
spumaviruses, are complex retroviruses whose genomic organization has been known 
since the cloning of the prototypic primate foamy virus type 1. These
retroviruses infect most cell lines in culture, but circulating lymphocytes seem 
to represent their major reservoir in vivo. FV infection leads to the formation
of multinucleated giant cells, resulting from the fusion of adjacent infected
cells, which present multiple vacuoles giving the monolayer culture a foam
aspect. These two features, combined with electron microscopy studies, have
helped investigators in their attempt to isolate new FVs. These viruses were
described and isolated from different animal species, mostly in nonhuman
primates. Here we present the successive steps leading to the isolation of the
equine foamy virus from peripheral blood lymphocytes of infected horses.
