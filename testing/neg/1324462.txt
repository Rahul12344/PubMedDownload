Human Lactobacillus sp strain GG (Lactobacillus GG) administered during acute
rotavirus diarrhea has been shown to promote clinical recovery. To elucidate the 
immune mechanisms behind such a favorable outcome, the ELISPOT (solid phase
enzyme-linked immunospot) assay of Ig- and specific antibody-secreting cells
among circulating lymphocytes was used, giving indirect evidence of the
immunologic events in the gut. After rehydration, 39 children with acute
rotavirus diarrhea, mean age 16 (SD 6) mo, randomly received either a
Lactobacillus GG fermented milk product (study group) or a pasteurized yogurt
(placebo group). The duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter in the study 
group than in the placebo group [mean 1.1 (SD 0.6) versus 2.5 (SD 1.4)d, p =
0.001]. Lactobacillus GG therapy was associated with a significantly enhanced
nonspecific humoral response during the acute phase of the infection, reflected
in the IgG, IgA, and IgM Ig-secreting cell numbers. At convalescence, 90% of the 
study group versus 46% of the placebo group had developed an IgA specific
antibody-secreting cell response to rotavirus (p = 0.006). The results indicate
that Lactobacillus GG promotes recovery from rotavirus diarrhea via augmentation 
of the local immune defense. Furthermore, specific IgA response to rotavirus is
endorsed, which is possibly relevant in protection against reinfections.
