Over the last dozen years the relative frequencies of specific transfusion
reactions have markedly altered, in general for the better. Although AIDS remains
the Public's primary concern, the risk of AIDS from a transfusion is extremely
low at this point. Hepatitis remains the most common infectious complication of
blood transfusion, but only 1 in 6,000 units now carry a risk, whereas in the
early 1980's the risk is believed to have been close to 10% per patient.
Transmission of HTLV-I/II has also been markedly reduced by tests of donor sera. 
In contrast, cytomegalovirus has become of increased importance in view of the
large number of patients immunosuppressed for transplantation and cancer therapy;
bacterial growth in blood components appears to be increasingly common; and
Chagas disease is likely to become a serious transfusion problem in this country.
More widespread use of filters which remove three logs or more of white blood
cells from components should play a major role in reducing transfusion reactions 
further.
