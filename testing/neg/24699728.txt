The nucleation and growth of protein, nucleic acid and virus crystals from
solution are functions of underlying kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that
govern the process, and these are all supersaturation-dependent. While the
mechanisms of macromolecular crystal growth are essentially the same as for
conventional crystals, the underlying parameters are vastly different, in some
cases orders of magnitude lower, and this produces very different crystallization
processes. Numerous physical features of macromolecular crystals are of serious
interest to X-ray diffractionists; the resolution limit and mosaicity, for
example, reflect the degree of molecular and lattice order. The defect structure 
of crystals has an impact on their response to flash-cooling, and terminal
crystal size is dependent on impurity absorption and incorporation. The variety
and extent of these issues are further unique to crystals of biological
macromolecules. All of these features are amenable to study using atomic force
microscopy, which provides direct images at the nanoscale level. Some of those
images are presented here.
