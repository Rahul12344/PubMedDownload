Newly recognized rat parvovirus (rat orphan parvovirus: ROPV) was examined for
viral excretion and persistence in infected rats, and also for infectivity to
mice and hamsters. The virus appeared to replicate mainly in lymphoid or
hematopoietic tissues, and was detected in feces, urine and oropharynx of the
infected rats at 1 to 4 weeks postinfection. The infective virus was also
detected in peripheral leukocytes and various tissues at an acute phase of
infection, and decreased in every tissue at 8 weeks postinfection. Viral DNA,
however, was persistent in lymphoid tissues at least up to 24 weeks
postinfection. When the virus was inoculated to mice and hamsters, no evidence of
viral production and antibody response was demonstrated. ROPV is assumed to be a 
variant of the known rat parvovirus which resulted to alter cell tropism and
persist in lymphoid or hematopoietic tissues, in order to escape from host immune
system.
