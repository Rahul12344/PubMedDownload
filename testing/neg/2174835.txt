Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) is a model for the study of lentiviral
infections. The authors' hypothesis is that radioimmunodetection has the
potential to detect lentiviral proteins at the surface of infected cells. A
monoclonal antibody (CAEV92A1) specific for a CAE virus (CAEV)-associated
glycoprotein and a control antibody were radiolabeled with technetium-99m (99mTc)
using the pretinning method. Cell binding assays were used to evaluate
immunoreactivity and binding properties of 99mTc-labeled antibodies to
CAEV-infected cells. 99mTc-CAEV92A1 bound preferentially to
paraformaldehyde-fixed and live CAEV-infected cells. 99mTc-CAEV92A1 did not
appear to be shed rapidly from its binding site.
