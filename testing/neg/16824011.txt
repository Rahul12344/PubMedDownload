Fortunately, I began research in 1950 when the basic concepts of microbial
genetics could be explored experimentally. I began with bacteriophage lambda and 
tried to establish the colinearity of its linkage map with its DNA molecule. My
students and I worked out the regulation of lambda repressor synthesis for the
establishment and maintenance of lysogeny. We also investigated the proteins
responsible for assembly of the phage head. Using cell extracts, we discovered
how to package DNA inside the head in vitro. Around 1972, I began to use
molecular genetics to understand the developmental biology of Myxococcus xanthus.
In particular, I wanted to learn how myxococcus builds its multicellular fruiting
body within which it differentiates spores. We identified two cell-to-cell
signals used to coordinate development. We have elucidated, in part, the signal
transduction pathway for C-signal that directs the morphogenesis of a fruiting
body.
