Lack of transmission of type B hepatitis by fiberoptic upper endoscopy.

Hoofnagle JH, Blake J, Buskell-Bales Z, Seeff LB.

We prospectively investigated the possibility that type B hepatitis might be
transmitted during fiberoptic endoscopy from hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg)-positive patients to others subsequently endoscoped. All 186 patients
having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy during a 6-month period at the
Washington, D.C., Veterans Administration Medical Center had a blood sample
obtained at the time of the procedure. Three patients were found to be
HBsAG-positive and 45 others to have either antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) or
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Follow-up evaluation for
evidence of type B hepatitis and hepatitis B virus infection was possible in only
76% of patients. One patient developed type B hepatitis. This patient's endoscopy
did not follow endoscopy of any known HBsAg-positive individual, but he had
received five units of blood 5 months before hepatitis developed. No other
patient showed clinical, biochemical, or serologic evidence of hepatitis during
the follow-up period. These data suggest that transmission of type B hepatitis
during fiberoptic endoscopy is rare, if it occurs at all, and support the current
policy of not sterilizing the fiberoptic endoscope between procedures and of not 
routinely screening patients for HBsAg.
