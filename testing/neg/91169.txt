Reverse transcriptase pauses at N2-methylguanine during in vitro transcription of
Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA.

Youvan DC, Hearst JE.

A restriction fragment strand complementary to a sequence near the 3' end of
Escherichia coli 16S rRNA has been used to prime reverse transcriptase (avian
myeloblastosis virus RNA-directed DNA nucleotidyltransferase;
deoxynucleosidetriphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.7). In
addition to transcripts that were extended to the 5' end of the RNA, two major
transcription intermediates were observed. These discrete-sized cDNA
intermediates are the result of a kinetic barrier imposed by monomethylation of
the amino group on guanine that participates in base-pairing. Both major
transcription intermediates correspond to attenuation at the known positions of
N2-methylguanine (m2G) in the rRNA sequence. The relaxation time for elongation
of the cDNA through m2G is approximately 3 min. No other major kinetic pauses
were observed in the 1340 bases transcribed.
