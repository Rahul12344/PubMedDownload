Protection against Schistosoma mansoni infection in C57BL/6 female mice was
evaluated by two DNA vaccination strategies. Mice were either vaccinated by
intramuscular injection with pcDNAI/Amp constructs encoding either Cu/Zn
cytosolic superoxide dismutase (CT-SOD), signal peptide-containing SOD (SP-SOD), 
glutathione peroxidase (GPX(bb)) or a mutated form of GPX (GPX(m)), or primed
with naked DNA constructs and boosted with recombinant vaccinia virus (RVV)
containing the same genes. Animals were then challenged with S. mansoni and the
level of protection was assessed as the reduction in worm burden. CT-SOD showed
significant levels of protection compared to the control group, ranging between
44 and 60%, while SP-SOD exhibited from 22 to 45%. GPX(bb) showed levels of
protection (23-55%) higher than GPX(m) (25-34%). The prime-boost strategy gave
the same results as naked DNA or recombinant vaccinia virus alone except in the
case of GPX, where the protection was 85%.
