INTRODUCTION: Surfactant protein D (SP-D) plays an important role in the innate
responses against pathogens and its production is altered in lung disorders.
METHODS: We studied the circulating levels of SP-D in 37 patients with acute
respiratory distress syndrome due to the A/H1N1 virus infection and in 40 healthy
controls. Cox logistic regression models were constructed to explore the
association of SP-D levels and risk of death.
RESULTS: Mortality rate after a 28-day was 32.42 %. Significant higher levels of 
SP-D were detected in A/H1N1 patients with fatal outcome (p < 0.05). After
adjusting for confounding variables, levels of SP-D ≥250 ng/mL were associated
with increased the risk of death (HR = 8.27, 95 % CI 1.1-64.1, p = 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that higher circulating levels of SP-D are
associated with higher mortality risk in critically ill A/H1N1 patients. SP-D
might be a predictive factor of poor outcomes in viral pneumonia.
