BACKGROUND: Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV)
stability, besides meeting production targets, is also a requirement for several 
control options of PRRS in pig breeding farms. This study aimed to investigate
the frequency of, and risk factors associated with, PRRSV instability in pig
breeding farms in northern Germany. In 120 sow herds, a questionnaire on
production and management parameters was filled, and blood samples from 30
suckling pigs from 10 different litters were taken and examined using real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
RESULTS: PRRSV was detected in 32 herds (27%), thus classified as PRRSV-unstable.
According to multivariable logistic regression analysis, a suckling period
≤ 21 days, a low distance between the cadaver collection site and the actual sow 
barn, ≥ 2 pig herds in a 1000 m radius, presence of external employees, a time
interval between purchase of gilts of ≤ 9 weeks and a 1- or 2-weekly farrowing
rhythm were associated with a higher risk of PRRSV instability.
CONCLUSIONS: External and internal biosecurity as well as management factors were
associated with PRRSV instability, which could be targeted by farmers and
veterinarians to help them to achieve PRRSV PCR-negative status and in the
control of PRRS.
