Bumblebees are commercially reared and transported worldwide mainly for
pollination of greenhouse tomatoes. Three honeybee viruses have been reported in 
bumblebees: Acute bee paralysis virus, Kashmir bee virus and Deformed wing virus.
We developed a multiplex RT-PCR with primers designed on highly conserved regions
of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in order to detect a maximum range of viral
variants. Rearing facilities and governmental organizations can now thoroughly
screen bumblebee colonies with a cost-effective technique with an integrated
internal amplification control (IAC) implementable in laboratories that strive
for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification.
