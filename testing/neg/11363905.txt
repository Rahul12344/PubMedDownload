Eradication of HIV--hope or hype?

[No authors listed]

AIDS: An overview is provided of a 1996 meeting of researchers who considered the
possibility of eradicating HIV from infected people and the implications it might
have for the current treatment of HIV infection. Definitions of what the
researchers considered to be complete suppression and eradication are given, as
are prospects for eradication within the following three populations: newborns
(mother-to-child transmission); primary or acutely infected people (those
recently exposed to HIV, such as healthcare workers exposed to HIV via
accidents); and chronically infected people (persons who have been infected for a
year or longer). Duration of therapy is addressed, particularly with regard to
absence of viral load. Physicians are cautioned not to immediately stop therapy
in the presence of short-term eradication of the virus due to evidence indicating
a reappearance of the virus once therapy is halted. Therapeutic implications
arising from eradication therapy are examined, and include regimen options, drug 
availability, and concerns over drug resistance.
