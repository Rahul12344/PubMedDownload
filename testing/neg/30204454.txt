Five novel quinolizidine-based alkaloids (1-5) were obtained from the seeds of
Sophora alopecuroides L. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first examples of
sparteine-indolizine and matrine-indolizine alkaloids, respectively, whereas 3
and 4 are epimeric normatrine-julolidine alkaloids with unusual skeletons. The
structures of these compounds were determined by spectroscopic methods,
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and electronic circular dichroism analyses.
Hypothetical biosynthetic pathways of 1-5 were proposed. Compound 2 exhibited
significant antiviral activity against the hepatitis B virus.
