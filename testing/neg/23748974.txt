Molecular analysis of parapoxvirus envelope genes was performed. Parapoxvirus DNA
was detected in eight calves from eight farms in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, between
April and September 2010. Seven of the detected viruses were identified as bovine
papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) by sequencing, because their nucleotide identity 
was more than 96.8% similar compared with BPSV strain V660. Among them, two
formed a subgroup, because their amplicons were digested with Xmn I (a marker for
BPSV) and Hinc II and exhibited a T61C nucleotide substitution in the sequenced
region. The remaining virus was pseudocowpox virus that had not been reported
previously in Japan. Our results demonstrate the presence of a new BPSV variant
in Japan with genetic variability in the envelope gene.
