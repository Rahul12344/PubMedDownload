nuclear export.

The NS1 protein of influenza viruses is a major virulence factor and exerts its
function through interacting with viral/cellular RNAs and proteins. In this
study, we identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1) 
as an interacting partner of NS1 proteins by a proteomic method. Knockdown of
hnRNP A2/B1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in higher levels of NS
vRNA, NS1 mRNA, and NS1 protein in the virus-infected cells. In addition, we
demonstrated that hnRNP A2/B1 proteins are associated with NS1 and NS2 mRNAs and 
that knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 promotes transport of NS1 mRNA from the nucleus to 
the cytoplasm in the infected cells. Lastly, we showed that knockdown of hnRNP
A2/B1 leads to enhanced virus replication. Our results suggest that hnRNP A2/B1
plays an inhibitory role in the replication of influenza A virus in host cells
potentially through suppressing NS1 RNA/protein levels and NS1 mRNA
nucleocytoplasmic translocation.
