In previous studies, the highest frequencies (16%) of the CCR5 delta32 deletion
have been found in populations of Finno-Ugric origin. We here report a high CCR5 
delta32 frequency (15%) in another Finno-Ugric populations, the Estonians. The
highest frequency (18%) was found on the geographically isolated Estonian island 
of Dagö. We examined 504 healthy unrelated individuals of Estonian nationality,
whose grandparents were born in Estonia. The polymerase chain reaction assay was 
performed and the amplified products were digested with EcoRI.
