Base-By-Base is a comprehensive tool for the creation and editing of multiple
sequence alignments that is coded in Java and runs on multiple platforms. It can 
be used with gene and protein sequences as well as with large viral genomes,
which themselves can contain gene annotations. This report describes new features
added to Base-By-Base over the last 7 years. The two most significant additions
are: (1) The recoding and inclusion of "consensus-degenerate hybrid
oligonucleotide primers" (CODEHOP), a popular tool for the design of degenerate
primers from a multiple sequence alignment of proteins; and (2) the ability to
perform fuzzy searches within the columns of sequence data in multiple sequence
alignments to determine the distribution of sequence variants among the
sequences. The intuitive interface focuses on the presentation of results in
easily understood visualizations and providing the ability to annotate the
sequences in a multiple alignment with analytic and user data.
