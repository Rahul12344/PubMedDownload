Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death
worldwide. Recently, comprehensive whole genome and exome sequencing analyses for
HCC revealed new cancer-associated genes and a variety of genomic alterations. In
particular, frequent genetic alterations of the chromatin remodeling genes were
observed, suggesting a new potential therapeutic target for HCC. Sequencing
analysis has further identified the molecular complexities of multicentric
lesions and intratumoral heterogeneity. Detailed analyses of the somatic
substitution pattern of the cancer genome and the HBV virus genome integration
sites by using whole-genome sequencing will elucidate the molecular basis and
diverse etiological factors involved in liver cancer development.
