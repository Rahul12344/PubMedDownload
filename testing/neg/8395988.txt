In a Swedish prospective study of congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, 76 
infants were shown to be infected among 16,474 newborns screened by virus
isolation in urine. Seventy-three of the excreters were followed up and one
developed Type 1 diabetes, as compared to 38 of the 19,483 children born during
the same period (p = 0.14, Fisher's one-tailed test). Thus we found no evidence
that the combined finding of congenital CMV infection and Type 1 diabetes
mellitus was related.
