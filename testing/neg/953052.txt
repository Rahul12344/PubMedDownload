From Mycobacterium phlei, glycolipid fractions have been isolated which
inactivate phage Phlei. On the basis of the characteristics of the inactivation
(specificity, kinetics, requirement for Ca++) typical of the phage-host cell
system, it was concluded that these fractions contain the receptor sites for
phage Phlei ; this conclusion was supported by electron microscopic studies. All 
the active fractions contain four kinds of components : fatty acids, glycerol,
sugars (D-lyxose, 6-0-methyl-D-glucose, and low amounts of glucose and mannose), 
and water-soluble acids. These acids are isolated by degradation of the receptor 
fractions as oxalic and pyruvic acids. Variations of the ratio oxalic
acid/pyruvic acid according to the mode of degradation and the absence of the
peak characteristic of the protons of a pyruvic acid residue in the NMR spectrum,
suggest that these acids might arise from the splitting of oxaloacetic acid. A
tentative structure of the receptor is proposed, in many monoglycerides are
linked through keto-acid to a polysaccharide core.
