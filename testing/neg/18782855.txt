OBJECTIVES: Haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is known as a relatively rare
complication in autoimmune diseases. Here we analysed the clinical features of
HPS in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases.
METHODS: One thousand and fourteen patients with systemic autoimmune diseases
admitted to Hokkaido University Hospital from 1997 to 2007 were recruited [350
SLE, 136 RA, 98 polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), 88 SSc, 91 vasculitis
syndrome, 37 primary SS, 26 adult onset Still's disease (AOSD) and 188 other
diseases]. Clinical features and treatment outcomes were retrospectively
analysed.
RESULTS: Thirty cases (3.0%) fulfilled HPS criteria (progressive cytopenia in two
or more lineages and haemophagocytosis in reticuloendothelial systems).
Underlying diseases were SLE (18), RA (2), PM/DM (2), SSc (2), vasculitis (1), SS
(2) and AOSD (3). Nineteen patients were diagnosed as having
autoimmune-associated HPS, eight infection-associated, one drug-induced and one
developed HPS after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. For the treatment
of HPS, high-dose corticosteroid monotherapy was given in 26 cases, being
effective in 12 (46%). Ten out of 15 patients with corticosteroid-resistant
autoimmune-associated HPS were treated with CsA, cyclophosphamide or tacrolimus, 
leading to the remission in 80%. The overall mortality rate was 20%. Multivariate
analysis showed that the presence of infections and CRP level >50 mg/l on HPS
related with poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HPS among in-hospital patients with systemic
autoimmunity is not ignorable. Administration of immunosuppressants was effective
in cases with autoimmune-associated HPS, whereas prognosis was poor in
infection-associated HPS.
