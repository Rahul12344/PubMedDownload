OBJECTIVE: The prevention and diagnosis of transfusion-associated HCMV infection 
has to address different questions: Is the blood donor potentially infections? Is
the transfused recipient undergoing an active primary or secondary infection?
DATA SOURCES: International literature (Current Contents Life Sciences) and
reports of our study-group.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Original articles in English and German.
RESULTS: Monocytes have been identified as the major site of latency of human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in peripheral blood. High seropositivity rates are
observed in polytransfused individuals, intravenous drug users, organ transplant 
recipients, maintenance hemodialysis patients, homo/bisexuals and prostitutes.
Although, there have been important developments in order to improve the
sensitivity of the ELISAs for the diagnosis of active HCMV infection, serologic
testing often fails to detect IgM and IgA antibodies in immunocompromised
patients. Rapid virus isolation, structural antigen detection and DNA
amplification by PCR in peripheral blood monocytes have considerably improved
diagnosis of acute HCMV infection in neonates, organ transplant recipients and
AIDS patients. Due to the low correlation of HCMV DNA detection and HCMV disease,
PCR testing is actually not recommended for the monitoring of high risk patients 
and screening of infectiosity of blood components.
CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence numerous improvements in serological, virological
and molecular methods, a more efficient prevention and diagnosis of
transfusion-associated HCMV infection has become possible.
