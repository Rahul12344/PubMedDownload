BACKGROUND: The vast majority of studies aimed at detecting human papillomavirus 
(HPV) DNA in skin cancer have used sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
methods but the PCR technique, despite its high sensitivity, is not suitable to
ascertain whether (i) the presence of HPV can be related only to few cells
harbouring the virus, (ii) the presence of HPV is due to a tumour surface
contamination and (iii) the presence of HPV is localized in cancer cells, rather 
than in normal keratinocytes present in the tumour biopsy. In a recent work we
have found mucosal high-risk (HR) HPV genotypes in primary melanoma by PCR.
OBJECTIVES: To localize mucosal HR-HPV nucleic acids and tumoural melanocytic
marker in the same sections of primary melanoma samples in order to understand
the relationship between HPVs and melanoma cells.
METHODS: We have developed a very sensitive method that combines an
enzyme-amplified fluorescent in situ hybridization (ISH) for the detection of HPV
nucleic acids (types 16 and 18) with a chemiluminescent immunohistochemistry
(IHC) method for the detection of the tumoural melanocytic marker HMB-45
sequentially in the same section. Digital images of fluorescent ISH and
chemiluminescent IHC were separately recorded, assigned different colours and
merged using specific software for image analysis.
RESULTS: The combined fluorescent ISH and chemiluminescent IHC demonstrated a
sharp colocalization (in the range 60-80%) of HPV nucleic acids and melanoma
marker inside the same sections of melanoma biopsies, with a strong specificity
and sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The strong colocalization of mucosal HR-HPV nucleic acids and HMB-45
melanocytic marker emphasized that viral nucleic acids were specifically present 
in melanoma cells and supported a possible active role of HPV in malignant
melanoma.
