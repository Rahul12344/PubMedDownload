BACKGROUND/AIMS: To identify risk factors of postoperative ascites after
hepatectomy for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatitis B
virus associated-cirrhosis.
METHODOLOGY: The data of 73 patients were reviewed in current study. Pre- and
intra-operative variables were retrospectively analyzed using uni- and
multi-variate analyses. The diagnostic accuracy of the predictors was evaluated
by the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis.
RESULTS: Indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) >10%, tumor size
>10cm, splenectomy, middle hepatic vein (MHV) resection, red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion were risk factors in univariate analysis. However, only ICGR15 >10%, 
tumor size >10cm and RBC transfusion showed prognostic power in multivariate
analysis. ROC analysis suggested the best cut-off value of risk factors was 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated the postoperative ascites could be predicted by 
pre- and intra-operative variables. ICGR15 >10%, tumor size >10cm and RBC
transfusion were independent risk factors for ascites after hepatectomy. Patients
with two or more of the above-mentioned risk factors may suffer postoperative
ascites after hepatectomy.
