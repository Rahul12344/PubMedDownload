compared to normal levels in single-donor fresh-frozen plasma, a licensed
solvent/detergent-treated plasma (Octaplas) and a development product (Uniplas).

Impaired capacity of thrombin generation (TG) was found in single-donor
fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) units subjected to medical device treatment by a
combination of methylene-blue dye and subsequent white-light exposure (MB plasma,
MBP) compared to normal levels in non-MB-treated single-donor FFP, the licensed
plasma product Octaplas, and a product under development (Uniplas; working title)
applicable independently from the recipient's blood group. This result held true 
for MBP units obtained from two different European sources revealing a more
significant TG impairment using the local inactivation system in blood banks
("in-house") than an industrial MB treatment. Supplementation of functional
fibrinogen to physiological levels did not normalise the altered TG capacity in
MBP, whereas addition of Octaplas did. No clear-cut correlation between
coagulation factor levels in MBP and hampered TG capacity was found, suggesting a
composite effect of impairment. A thorough elucidation and evaluation regarding
the possible clinical impact of these findings seems prudent.
