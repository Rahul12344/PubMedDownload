BACKGROUND: CD4(+) cell count, the common HIV infection screening test, is costly
and unable to differentiate HIV monoinfection from its concurrent infection with 
hepatitis B or C virus. We aimed to ascertain diagnostic value of serum adenosine
deaminase (ADA) activity as a useful tool to differentiate HIV mono- and
co-infection.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 30 HIV-HBV and 30 HIV-HCV coinfected
patients, 33 HIV positive subjects, and 72 controls. CD4(+) cell count, serum
total ADA (tADA), and ADA1, and ADA2 isoenzyme activities were determined and
their sensitivity and specificity were computed.
RESULTS: tADA and ADA2 activities were significantly higher and CD4(+) counts
were markedly lower in all patients compared with controls. Strong inverse
agreements between CD4(+) cell counts and both tADA and ADA2 activities were
observed. Serum tADA and ADA1 activities showed the highest specificity and the
highest sensitivity, respectively, for differentiating HIV monoinfection from
HIV-HBV and HIV-HCV coinfections.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed strong agreement and correlation between CD4(+) cell count
and ADA enzyme activity. Based on high ADA sensitivity and specificity, it is
concluded that determination of ADA activity might be a novel diagnostic tool to 
distinguish of HIV monoinfection from its coinfection with HBV or HCV.
