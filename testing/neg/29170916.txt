In recent years, unexpected outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by emerging
and re-emerging viruses have become more frequent, which is possibly due to
environmental changes. These outbreaks result in the loss of life and economic
hardship. Vaccines and therapeutics should be developed for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize and discuss the
latest progress in the development of small-molecule viral inhibitors against
highly pathogenic coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Ebola virus, and
Zika virus. These viruses can interfere with the specific steps of viral life
cycle by blocking the binding between virus and host cells, disrupting viral
endocytosis, disturbing membrane fusion, and interrupting viral RNA replication
and translation, thereby demonstrating potent therapeutic effect against various 
emerging and re-emerging viruses. We also discuss some general strategies for
developing small-molecule viral inhibitors.
