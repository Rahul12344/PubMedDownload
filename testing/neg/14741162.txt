An E1-deleted adenoviral recombinant derived from the chimpanzee serotype 6
expressing a codon-optimized truncated form of gag of human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) was tested for induction of a transgene product-specific
CD8+ T cell response upon oral immunization of mice. The vector was shown to
induce gag-specific CD8+ T cells detectable at moderate frequencies of
approximately 0.5-1.0% in the spleens and to provide partial protection in a
surrogate challenge model based on intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection of mice with 
a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing gag (VVgag) of HIV-1. Frequencies of
gag-specific CD8+ T cells could be augmented by using a different, i.e.,
heterologous, vaccine carrier based on a distinct recombinant virus or an
alternative adenoviral serotype expressing the same form of gag for oral or
systemic-booster immunization.
