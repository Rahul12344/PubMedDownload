Uncontrolled immune responses to intracellular DNA have been shown to induce
autoimmune diseases. Homeostasis regulation of immune responses to cytosolic DNA 
is critical for limiting the risk of autoimmunity and survival of the host. Here,
we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 30α (TRIM30α) was
induced by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in dendritic cells
(DCs). Knockdown or genetic ablation of TRIM30α augmented the type I IFNs and
interleukin-6 response to intracellular DNA and DNA viruses. Trim30α-deficient
mice were more resistant to infection by DNA viruses. Biochemical analyses showed
that TRIM30α interacted with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which is
a critical regulator of the DNA-sensing response. Overexpression of TRIM30α
promoted the degradation of STING via K48-linked ubiquitination at Lys275 through
a proteasome-dependent pathway. These findings indicate that E3 ligase TRIM30α is
an important negative-feedback regulator of innate immune responses to DNA
viruses by targeting STING.
