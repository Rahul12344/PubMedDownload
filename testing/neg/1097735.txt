Replication of bacteriophage M13 IX. Requirement of the Escherichia coli dnaG
function for M13 duplex DNA replication.

Ray DS, Dueber J, Suggs S.

Temperature-shift experiments with an Escherichia coli dnaG strain indicate a
requirement for the dnaG function for M13 phage production only at an early stage
of infection. Mutant cells infected at nonpermissive temperature form the
parental RF (SS leads to RF) but do not replicate further. A shift to
nonpermissive temperature after infection inhibits RF leads to RF replication but
not RF leads to SS synthesis. The synthesis of both strands of the duplex RF was 
inhibited equally after a temperature shift during RF leads to RF replication. We
infer that the dnaG protein is required for M13 production only during RF
replication and that it is required for the synthesis of both strands of the RF.
