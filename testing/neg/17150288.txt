To evaluate the efficacy of mucosal vaccination with a beta-propiolactone
inactivated caprine herpesvirus-1 (CpHV-1) vaccine, goats received vaginal
administrations of two 7-day cycles at 2 weeks intervals. Seven days after the
end of the second cycle, goats were challenged intravaginally with 4 ml of
virulent BA.1 strain of CpHV-1. Vaccinated goats shed challenge virus for 8 days 
but, in comparison with control unvaccinated-challenged goats, were significantly
protected from the classical clinical signs of genital lesions. Even without
adjuvants, prolonged mucosal vaccination induced production of secretory IgA and 
provided significant clinical protection.
