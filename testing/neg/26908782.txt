    Clin Infect Dis. 2016 May 1;62(9):1139-40.

Norovirus incidence was compared between severe combined immunodeficiency
children with (n = 10) and without (n = 8) B cells. 60% of B+ and 63% of B-
patients developed norovirus infections therefore norovirus replication in B
lymphocytes is not essential for infection.
