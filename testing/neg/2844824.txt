IgG subclasses to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) were detected in plasma from
different sources used for the production of varicella/zoster immunoglobulin
(VZIG). IgG1 and IgG3 were the principal virus antibodies in plasma from healthy 
donors as well as from convalescents after primary and reactivated disease.
Anti-VZV IgG3 antibodies were predominant among varicella convalescents while
IgG1 antibodies dominated among zoster convalescents. IgG4 antibodies were
present in zoster convalescents and healthy donors but were rarely detected in
varicella convalescents. Antiviral IgG2 antibodies were found only in a few
cases. Studies of plasma samples collected from one varicella convalescent during
a period of seven months following an outbreak of disease, demonstrated a rapid
fall in antiviral IgG1 and IgG3, while IgG4 increased to reach a maximum six
months after the onset of symptoms. The relative distribution of VZV-specific
subclasses in a plasma pool was conserved during a fractionation procedure
combining polyethyleneglycol 6000 precipitation with ion exchange chromatography,
thus suggesting that the protective efficacy is maintained in the resulting
immunoglobin preparations.
