Respiratory syncytial virus: its transmission in the hospital environment.

Hall CB.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) over the past two decades has been recognized
as the most important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and
young children. Recently, it has also been identified as a major nosocomial
hazard on pediatric wards. The potential for RSV to spread on such wards is
underlined by several singular characteristics of RSV. It arrives in yearly
epidemics and is highly contagious in all age groups. Immunity is of short
duration, allowing repeated infections to occur. Thus, during an epidemic 20--40 
percent of infants admitted for other conditions may acquire nosocomial RSV
infection, as well as 50 percent of the ward personnel. The usual infection
control procedures for respiratory illnesses have had limited success in
controlling the spread of RSV. This may be due in part to the modes of
transmission of RSV. Inoculation occurs mainly through the eye and nose, rather
than the mouth. This may be via large-particle aerosols or droplets, requiring
close contact. The virus, however, does not seem capable of traversing distances 
by small-particle aerosols. Nevertheless, it is able to remain infectious on
various environmental surfaces, suggesting fomites as a source of spread. Indeed,
inoculation after touching such contaminated surfaces can occur, and may be a
major second means of spread, in hospitals as well as in families.
