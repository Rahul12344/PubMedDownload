Besides the rapid diagnostic tests based on influenza A and B antigens
nucleoproteins detection, which are routinely used, the isolation of influenza
strains is still required to obtain recent variant isolates for full antigenic
characterization, in order to up-date the influenza vaccine composition. To
increase the rapidity and the efficacy of the virus growth, we implemented a
culture test in 24-well plates by centrifugation of samples on to LLCMK2 cells in
the presence of trypsin. This test was routinely applied to 331 nasopharyngeal
swabs collected during the influenza A outbreak in the winters 1988-1989 and to
962 in 1989-1990. The centrifugation culture assay has been compared with the
direct detection of NP antigens in the clinical samples by immunofluorescence and
capture ELISA tests and with the conventional virus isolation by inoculation of
the samples to embryonated eggs and to LLCMK2 cell cultures. Compared with the NP
antigen detection tests, the centrifugation culture assay closely correlated (r =
0.95) and the sensitivity and specificity were also excellent, 93.4% and 99.6%,
respectively. Compared with the conventional culture assays, the centrifugation
culture markedly increased the performance (five times) and rapidity (2 days) of 
influenza virus isolation and identification.
