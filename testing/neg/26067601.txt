To establish a productive infection, HIV-1 must counteract cellular innate immune
mechanisms and redirect cellular processes toward viral replication. Recent
studies have discovered that HIV-1 and other primate immunodeficiency viruses
subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to achieve these ends. The viral Vpr and
Vpx proteins target cell cycle controls to counter innate immunity. The
cell-cycle-related protein Cyclin L2 is also utilized to counter innate immunity.
The viral Tat protein utilizes Cyclin T1 to activate proviral transcription, and 
regulation of Cyclin T1 levels in CD4(+) T cells has important consequences for
viral replication and latency. This review will summarize this emerging evidence 
that primate immunodeficiency viruses subvert cell cycle regulatory mechanisms to
enhance replication.
