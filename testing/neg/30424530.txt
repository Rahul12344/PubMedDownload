Currently, Brazil lives a triple arboviruses epidemic (DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV)
making the differential diagnosis difficult for health professionals. Here, we
aimed to investigate chikungunya cases and the possible occurrence of
co-infections during the epidemic in Amapá (AP) that started in 2014 when the
first autochthonous cases were reported and in Rio de Janeiro (RJ) in 2016. We
further performed molecular characterization and genotyping of representative
strains. In AP, 51.4% of the suspected cases were confirmed for CHIKV, 71.0%
(76/107). Of those, 24 co-infections by CHIKV/DENV, two by CHIKV/DENV-1, and two 
by CHIKV/DENV-4 were observed. In RJ, 76.9% of the suspected cases were confirmed
for CHIKV and co-infections by CHIKV/DENV (n = 8) and by CHIKV/ZIKV (n = 17) were
observed. Overall, fever, arthralgia, myalgia, prostration, edema, exanthema,
conjunctival hyperemia, lower back pain, dizziness, nausea, retroorbital pain,
and anorexia were the predominating chikungunya clinical symptoms described. All 
strains analyzed from AP belonged to the Asian genotype and no amino acid changes
were observed. In RJ, the East-Central-South-African genotype (ECSA) circulation 
was demonstrated and no E1-A226V mutation was observed. Despite this, an E1-V156A
substitution was characterized in two samples and for the first time, the
E1-K211T mutation was reported in all samples analyzed.
