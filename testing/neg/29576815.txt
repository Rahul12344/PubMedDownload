Background: Treatment options among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected
children are limited as only a few Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART)
are approved worldwide for paediatric use. Among children, frequent changes in
HAART regimen can rapidly exhaust treatment options, and information addressing
this issue is scarce.
Objective: The aim of the study was to determine factors associated with the
modification of initial HAART regimen modification among HIV-infected children.
Method: A retrospective study was performed among HIV-infected children aged 18
and below, that received HAART for at least six months in a tertiary hospital in 
Malaysia. Factors associated with modification of initial HAART regimen were
investigated.
Results: Out of 99 patients, 71.1% (n=71) required initial HAART regime
modification. The most common reason for HAART modification was treatment failure
(n=39, 54.9%). Other reasons included drug toxicity (n=14, 19.7%), change to
fixed-dose products (n=11, 15.5%), product discontinuation (n=4, 5.6%) and
intolerable taste (n=3, 4.2%). The overall mean time retention on initial HAART
before regimen modification was 3.32 year Â± 2.24 years (95% CI, 2.79-3.85).
Patient's adherence was the only factor associated with initial regimen
modification in this study. Participants with poor adherence showed a five-fold
risk of having their initial HAART regimen modified compared to those with good
adherence (adjusted OR [95% CI], 5.250 [1.614 - 17.076], p = 0.006).
Conclusion: Poor adherence was significantly associated with initial regimen
modification, intervention to improve patient's adherence is necessary to prevent
multiple regimen modification among HIV-infected children.
