Recently, two prophylactic vaccines against the most significant oncogenic human 
papillomaviruses (HPV; 16 and 18) became available that efficiently protect
against persistent HPV infection and cancer precursors. However, clinical trials 
performed with these vaccines did not provide evidence that they would influence 
the natural history of prevalent HPV infections, that is, their eventual
malignant progression. Because, even under the optimistic assumption of high
vaccine coverage, a significant reduction of cancer incidence can only be
expected after two decades, there is a need for immune therapeutic strategies to 
be offered to persistently infected individuals who do not benefit from the
prophylactic vaccines. Here, we describe the reasons for failure of most of the
published approaches to HPV-specific therapies, highlight promising developments 
and present our view for future developments.
