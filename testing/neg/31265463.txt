Mathematical models have been used successfully at diverse scales of biological
organization, ranging from ecology and population dynamics to stochastic reaction
events occurring between individual molecules in single cells. Generally, many
biological processes unfold across multiple scales, with mutations being the best
studied example of how stochasticity at the molecular scale can influence
outcomes at the population scale. In many other contexts, however, an analogous
link between micro- and macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due to the
challenges involved in setting up and analyzing multi-scale models. Here, we
employ such a model to investigate how stochasticity propagates from individual
biochemical reaction events in the bacterial innate immune system to the ecology 
of bacteria and bacterial viruses. We show analytically how the dynamics of
bacterial populations are shaped by the activities of immunity-conferring enzymes
in single cells and how the ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial
defense strategies against viruses. Our results suggest that bacterial
populations in the presence of viruses can either optimize their initial growth
rate or their population size, with the first strategy favoring simple immunity
featuring a single restriction modification system and the second strategy
favoring complex bacterial innate immunity featuring several simultaneously
active restriction modification systems.
