Although the prognosis for patients with early-stage breast cancer has improved, 
the therapeutic options for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease
are limited. To improve the treatment of these patients, the molecular mechanisms
underlying breast cancer invasion and metastasis must be understood. In this
study, we report that signaling through the G12 family of heterotrimeric G
proteins (Galpha12 and Galpha13) promotes breast cancer cell invasion. Moreover, 
we demonstrate that inhibition of G12 signaling reduces the metastatic
dissemination of breast cancer cells in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the
expression of Galpha12 is significantly up-regulated in the earliest stages of
breast cancer, implying that amplification of G12 signaling may be an early event
in breast cancer progression. Taken together, these observations identify the G12
family proteins as important regulators of breast cancer invasion and suggest
that these proteins may be targeted to limit invasion- and metastasis-induced
patient morbidity and mortality.
