Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) has emerged as a major pathogen causing hand, foot, and 
mouth disease, as well as neurological disorders. The host immune response
affects the outcomes of EV-A71 infection, leading to either resolution or disease
progression. However, the mechanisms of how the mammalian innate immune system
detects EV-A71 infection to elicit antiviral immunity remain elusive. Here, we
report that the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is a key viral RNA sensor for sensing
EV-A71 infection to trigger antiviral immunity. Expression of TLR3 in HEK293
cells enabled the cells to sense EV-A71 infection, leading to type I,
IFN-mediated antiviral immunity. Viral double-stranded RNA derived from EV-A71
infection was a key ligand for TLR3 detection. Silencing of TLR3 in mouse and
human primary immune cells impaired the activation of IFN-Î² upon EV-A71
infection, thus reinforcing the importance of the TLR3 pathway in defending
against EV-A71 infection. Our results further demonstrated that TLR3 was a target
of EV-A71 infection. EV-A71 protease 2A was implicated in the downregulation of
TLR3. Together, our results not only demonstrate the importance of the TLR3
pathway in response to EV-A71 infection, but also reveal the involvement of
EV-A71 protease 2A in subverting TLR3-mediated antiviral defenses.
