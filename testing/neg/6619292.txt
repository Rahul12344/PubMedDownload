Direct isolation of H1N2 recombinant virus from a throat swab of a patient
simultaneously infected with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses.

Nishikawa F, Sugiyama T.

Two H1N2 recombinant viruses were isolated by a plaquing method from a throat
swab of a patient who was simultaneously infected with H1N1 and H3N2 influenza
viruses during the Tokyo epidemic of 1981. This is the first direct evidence that
recombination of influenza viruses occurred in the human body.
