Characterization of the interaction between polymerized human albumin and
hepatitis B surface antigen.

Milich DR, Gottfried TD, Vyas GN.

The interaction of polymerized human albumin with hepatitis B surface antigen was
characterized utilizing a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. The interaction was
specific as shown by quantitative inhibition of binding by soluble polymerized
human albumin. The interaction was species restricted in that hepatitis B surface
antigen did not bind nonhuman polymerized albumins. The albumin polymer size was 
critical to the binding reaction as was the concentration of hepatitis B surface 
antigen; the interaction was also temperature, ionic strength, and pH dependent. 
Hepatitis B e antigen positive sera possessed greater polyalbumin binding
reactivity than hepatitis B e antigen negative sera. This interaction was shown
to be inhibited by normal human serum which suggested that the polyalbumin
receptor on hepatitis B surface antigen may be a host rather than viral
component. In view of our previous observation that polymerized human albumin
binds human C1q, the interactions between polymerized human albumin, hepatitis B 
surface antigen, and human C1q may be relevant to hepatitis B virus-host receptor
mechanisms.
