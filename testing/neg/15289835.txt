We examined 1,918 Japanese gastric cancer cases diagnosed during the period
1976-1995 to clarify histology-specific gender, age and tumor-location
distributions of Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric carcinoma (EBV-GC).
EBV-GCs accounted for 4.5% and 6.1% of 1,088 intestinal-type and 830 diffuse-type
gastric carcinomas, respectively. Both intestinal- and diffuse-type EBV-GCs
showed male predominance, but the observed gender difference was statistically
significant only in diffuse-type carcinomas (P<0.001). An age-dependent decrease 
of the EBV-GC proportion was observed in intestinal-type carcinomas (P=0.002),
but not in diffuse-type carcinomas. In intestinal-type tumors, the estimated
incidence of EBV-GCs reached its peak around age 70. Diffuse-type EBV-GCs
appeared to have a much older peak incidence, if any. Both intestinal- and
diffuse-type EBV-GCs were least prevalent in the stomach antrum. This study,
examining the largest number of EBV-GCs in current literature, showed different
patterns of age-dependence in intestinal- and diffuse-type EBV-GCs, suggesting
that pathogenic pathways of EBV-GCs may be different in these 2 histological
types.
