Astrocytes are the first cells infected by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in
primary cultures of brain. These cells play key roles in intercellular signaling 
and neuronal development, and they modulate synaptic activity within the nervous 
system. Using ratiometric fura-2 digital calcium imaging of >8,000 neurons and
glia, we found that MCMV-infected astrocytes showed an increase in intracellular 
basal calcium levels and an enhanced response to neuroactive substances,
including glutamate and ATP, and to high potassium levels. Cultured neurons with 
no sign of MCMV infection showed attenuated synaptic signaling after infection of
the underlying astrocyte substrate, and intercellular communication between
astrocytes with no sign of infection was reduced by the presence of infected
glia. These bystander effects would tend to cause further deterioration of
cellular communication in the brain in addition to the problems caused by the
loss of directly infected cells.
