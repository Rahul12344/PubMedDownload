Inhibition of leukocyte trafficking via alpha4-integrin antibody blockade has
recently become a validated therapeutic approach for several inflammatory
diseases, including multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
In the midst of this recent success, 3 patients receiving chronic treatment with 
the anti-alpha4 antagonist natalizumab (Tysabri) for the treatment of multiple
sclerosis or Crohn's disease, developed JC-virus related progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy (PML). These unforeseen consequences suggest that long term
blockade of alpha4-integrins might prevent trafficking of non-pathogenic
lymphocytes that are essential for viral immunosurveillance. In the current issue
of the European Journal of Immunology Bjursten and colleagues report that long
term treatment with anti-alpha4-integrin antibodies results in exacerbation of
the murine model of colitis induced by the targeted deletion of the
heterotrimeric G protein subunit Galphai2. In order to properly evaluate the
efficacy and safety of anti-alpha4-integrin therapy, the relationship between
these observations in an immunologically altered animal model and human clinical 
disease needs to be carefully measured.
