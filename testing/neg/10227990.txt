Recent technical breakthroughs in generating soluble MHC class I-peptide
tetramers now allow the direct visualization of virus-specific CD8 T cells after 
infection in vivo. However, this technique requires the knowledge of the
immunodominant viral epitopes recognized by T cells. Here, we describe an
alternative approach to visualize polyclonal virus-specific CD8 T cells in vivo
using a simple adoptive transfer system. In our approach, C57BL/6 (Thy1.2) mice
were infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, vesicular stomatitis
virus, or vaccinia virus to induce virus-specific memory T cells. Tracer T cells 
(2 x 106) from these virus-immune mice were adoptively transferred into
nonirradiated (C57BL/6 x B6.PL-Thy-1a)F1 mice. After infection of the
F1-recipient mice with the appropriate virus, the transferred cells expanded
vigorously, and on day 8 postinfection 60-80% of total CD8 T cells were of donor 
T cell origin. Under the same conditions memory CD4 T cells gave rise to at least
10 times less cell numbers than memory CD8 T cells. The transfer system described
here not only allows to visualize effector and memory CD8 T cells in vivo but
also to isolate them for further in vitro characterization without knowing the
epitopes recognized by these Ag-specific CD8 T cells.
