Plasma HIV viremia can be suppressed and maintained below the limits of detection
for prolonged periods of time in the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals
who receive antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, the clinical outcome for
HIV-infected individuals who have access to these drugs is dramatically improved.
However, ART alone cannot eradicate HIV in infected individuals and this
impediment is likely in part due to the persistence of viral reservoirs in the
peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues of infected individuals despite the
suppression of plasma viremia. In recent years, major research efforts have been 
dedicated to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of persistent HIV
infection and to the development of therapeutic strategies aimed at eradicating
virus in infected individuals receiving ART. In this review, we discuss the
pathophysiology of CD4 T-cell HIV reservoirs, including recent advances in our
understanding of the mechanisms of persistent viral infection and perspectives
for eradication of HIV in infected individuals.
