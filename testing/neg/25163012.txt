Molecular and Biological Characterization of Distinct Strains of Jatropha mosaic 
virus from the Dominican Republic Reveal a Potential to Infect Crop Plants.

Melgarejo TA, Kon T, Gilbertson RL.

In the Dominican Republic (DO), jatropha plants with yellow mosaic symptoms are
commonly observed in and around fields of various crop plants. Complete
nucleotide sequences of DNA-A and DNA-B components of four bipartite begomovirus 
isolates associated with symptomatic jatropha plants collected from three
geographical locations in the DO were determined. Sequence comparisons revealed
highest identities (91 to 92%) with the DNA-A component of an isolate of Jatropha
mosaic virus (JMV) from Jamaica, indicating that the bipartite begomovirus
isolates from the DO are strains of JMV. When introduced into jatropha seedlings 
by particle bombardment, the cloned components of the JMV strains from the DO
induced stunting and yellow mosaic, indistinguishable from symptoms observed in
the field, thereby fulfilling Koch's postulates for the disease. The JMV strains 
also induced disease symptoms in Nicotiana benthamiana, tobacco, and several
cultivars of common bean from the Andean gene pool, including one locally grown
in the DO. Asymmetry in the infectivity and symptomatology of pseudorecombinants 
provided further support for the strain designation of the JMV isolates from the 
DO. Thus, JMV in the DO is a complex of genetically distinct strains that have
undergone local evolution and have the potential to cause disease in crop plants.
