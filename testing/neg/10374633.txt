AIM: To construct an inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) gene transferring
vector mediated by retrovirus.
METHODS: Recombinant DNA and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification
techniques were used.
RESULTS: With 2 steps of molecular cloning, the full-length cDNA encoding
macrophage iNOS was isolated from plasmid pKSiNOS and subcloned into intermediate
vector pSP72, adjusting the restriction enzyme sites in both 5'- and 3'-flanking 
ends of insert fragment. The retroviral vector pLNCXiNOS which contains iNOS
coding region, cytomegalovirus promoter and neomycin resistance (neor) gene was
further constructed. The authenticity of insertion size and orientation of iNOS
sequence was verified by restriction mapping and PCR analysis with iNOS
gene-specific primers.
CONCLUSION: Retroviral expression vector carrying iNOS fragment is obtained,
which provides a material to establish a model of iNOS gene-modified neurons.
