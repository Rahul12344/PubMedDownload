Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are immature myeloid cells with
immunosuppressive function. Compared to the level in healthy controls (HC), no
elevation of MDSC in chronic hepatitis C (cHEP-C) patients was found, and there
was no difference in MDSC based on genotype or viral load (P > 0.25). Moreover,
MDSC of cHEP-C patients inhibited CD8 T cell function as efficiently as MDSC of
HC did. Since we detected neither quantitative nor qualitative differences in
MDSC of cHEP-C patients relative to those of HC, we postulate that MDSC in
peripheral blood are most likely not significant regarding immune dysfunction in 
cHEP-C.
