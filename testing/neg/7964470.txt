During viral infections, CD8+,CD45RO+ T populations expand. These primed cells
express abundant levels of cytoplasmic granules that contain perforin and TIA-1. 
Recent work has suggested that the majority of this CD8+ population downregulates
Bcl-2 protein expression and is destined to undergo apoptosis. In this study we
have investigated the elimination of these apoptotic CD8+ T cells by both human
monocyte-derived and murine bone marrow macrophages. We have found that these
phagocytes recognize and ingest both apoptotic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells using an
alpha v beta 3 (vitronectin receptor)/CD36/thrombospondin recognition system,
with the same receptors being used in the recognition of apoptotic neutrophils.
These data provide new evidence for a mechanism that enables the clearance of
greatly increased populations of CD8+ effector cells which are found during viral
infections. This enables cellular homeostasis to occur in the host upon
resolution of viral diseases in vivo.
