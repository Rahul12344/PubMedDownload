We describe a rare case of primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma
(PCMZL) in a 33-year-old male affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related chronic
active hepatitis. The patient presented with multiple cutaneous papulonodular
lesions characterized by polymorphic immunomorphology, with inverse pattern of
immunoglobulin light chain restriction in two different lesions, coupled with
mucin deposition and anetoderma in a third lesion. The involution of lesions of
PCMZL with secondary anetoderma has been previously described, but this has not
been reported in the context of multiple lesions showing differing immunoglobulin
light chain restriction. We speculate that these findings may be secondary to a
variable interaction between a chronic antigenic stimulus (i.e. HBV) and its
specific immune response.
