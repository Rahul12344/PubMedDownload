BACKGROUND: Studies on the association of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection with colonic neoplasm are rare. We aimed to investigate the association
between chronic HBV infection and the development of colonic adenoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-three patients with chronic HBV
infection who underwent colonoscopic examination, were enrolled. A healthy
HBV-uninfected group was matched with the HBV group. Those with a previous
history of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases or colorectal surgery
were excluded from both HBV and HBV-uninfected groups. Clinical information and
data on age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption and comorbidities
were obtained. Advanced adenoma was defined as tubular adenoma ≥10mm, or adenoma 
with a villous component or high-grade dysplasia.
RESULTS: The HBV group had a higher rate of colorectal adenoma and advanced
adenoma than the HBV-uninfected group. Patients in the HBV group had larger
colorectal polyps than those in the HBV-uninfected group. In the chi square test,
HBV DNA positivity was significantly associated with colorectal adenoma (P <
0.001) and advanced adenoma (P = 0.007). HBV infection (odds ratio [OR] = 23.961,
95% CI: 9.400-61.076), diabetes mellitus (OR = 2.633, 95% CI: 1.071-6.473) and
age (OR = 1.057, 95% CI: 1.020-1.095) were significantly associated with advanced
adenoma in the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Multivariable logistic
regression analysis within the HBV group revealed that HBV DNA (OR = 1.236, 95%
CI: 1.029-1.485) was associated with advanced adenoma.
CONCLUSIONS: HBV DNA in patients with HBV infection and HBV infection are
independently associated with advanced colorectal adenoma development.
