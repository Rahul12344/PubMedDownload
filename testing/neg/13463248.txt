Studies on bacteriophages of hemolytic streptococci. I. Factors influencing the
interaction of phage and susceptible host cell.

KRAUSE RM.

The host ranges of bacteriophages for group A, types 1, 6, 12, and 25 and group C
streptococci have been determined. The findings indicate that the susceptibility 
to these phages is primarily a group-specific phenomenon, although it is modified
by several factors such as the hyaluronic acid capsule, lysogeny, and possibly
the presence of surface proteins. Phage antibody studies indicate that while the 
group A phages are antigenically related, they are distinct from the group C
phage. This is in agreement with the observation that group A phages are not
specific for their homologous streptococcal types. The purified group C
carbohydrate inactivates group C phage but not the group A phages, thus
suggesting that the carbohydrate, a component of the cell wall, may serve as the 
phage receptor site. It has not been possible to inactivate the group A phages
with group A carbohydrate. Phage lysis of groups A and C streptococci is
accompanied by fragmentation of the cell wall since the C carbohydrate has been
identified serologically and chemically in the supernate of centrifuged lysates. 
The immediate lysis of groups A and C hemolytic streptococci and their isolated
cell walls by an accesory heat-labile lytic factor in fresh group C lysates is
also described.
