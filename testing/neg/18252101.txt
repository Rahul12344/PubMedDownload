Simian virus infections of humans are an increasing public health concern. Simian
foamy virus (SFV) infections have been reported in persons occupationally exposed
to nonhuman primates and in a few hunters in Cameroon. To better understand this 
retroviral zoonosis in natural settings, we studied persons who lived in southern
Cameroon, near nonhuman primate habitats. First we studied a general population
of 1,164 adults; 4 were SFV positive according to serologic and molecular assays.
Then we studied 85 persons who reported having been bitten or scratched by
nonhuman primates; 7/29 (24.1%) of those who had contact with apes (gorillas or
chimpanzees) were SFV positive, compared with only 2/56 (3.6%) of those who had
had contact with monkeys. These data demonstrate efficient transmission of SFVs
to humans in natural settings in central Africa, specifically following ape
bites, and viral persistence in the human host.
