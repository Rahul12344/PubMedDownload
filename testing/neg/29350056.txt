Three new isolates (1-3) including one new sterol and two new flavonoids together
with three known sterols (4-6) were isolated from the leaves of Nicotiana
tabacum. Their structures were determined mainly by spectroscopic methods,
including extensive 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were evaluated for
their anti-tobacco mosaic virus and cytotoxic activities. The results showed that
compounds 2 and 3 exhibited high anti-TMV activity with inhibition rate of 34.2
and 33.4%, respectively, which were roughly equivalent to that of positive
control. The cytotoxicities of compounds 1 and 4-6 against five human tumour cell
lines were also tested, and tested compounds showed weak inhibitory activities
against some tested human tumour cell lines.
