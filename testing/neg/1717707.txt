An atypical syncytial variant of a high-grade Burkitt's-type B-cell lymphoma from
a patient with AIDS who was seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
was studied. A productive type D retrovirus infection was identified in
early-passage cell lines derived from two lymphomas from this patient. Nucleotide
and amino acid sequence analysis as well as immunologic reactivity indicated that
the isolated virus was highly related to Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV). MPMV
is an immunosuppressive type D retrovirus that causes an AIDS-like syndrome in
rhesus macaques. Amplification of DNA from the patient's diagnostic bone marrow
biopsy specimen by polymerase chain reaction generated the appropriate
MPMV-specific fragments and indicated that the patient was infected with the
MPMV-like retrovirus. In addition, the patient's serum contained antibodies which
recognized type D viral env proteins (gp70 and gp20) and gag proteins (p27 and
p14). Although there have been reports of human cell lines infected with type D
retroviruses and of type D-reactive human sera, this is the first evidence of a
type D retrovirus infection in a human confirmed by virus isolation, serum
reactivity, and viral DNA identification in tumor tissue.
