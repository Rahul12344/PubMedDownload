SETTING: A busy urban hospital in Cameroon.
OBJECTIVES: To compare the yield in bacteriologically proven tuberculosis (TB)
cases examining two morning vs. three spot-morning-spot sputum specimens (MM vs. 
SMS) by direct microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (AFB).
DESIGN: Repeated temporal cross-over between MM and SMS sampling for successive
TB suspects, using culture as gold standard.
RESULTS: A total of 799 suspects were screened using the MM strategy, identifying
223 smear-positives, and 808 suspects with the SMS strategy, yielding 236
smear-positives. Of the MM, 256 were culture-positive, of whom 195 (76%) were
smear-positive. For SMS, these figures were respectively 281 and 206 (73%), a
non-significant difference. The MM and SMS strategies also detected respectively 
28 and 30 smear-positive cases not confirmed by culture. No cases were lost to
treatment with either strategy.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) with late case presentation, smear microscopy of two morning
specimens detected at least as many positive cases as the classical strategy, and
no cases were lost before treatment. Two specimens for initial TB suspect
screening can thus be recommended, also without excessive workload. Comparative
studies in populations presenting with paucibacillary sputum are needed to
determine the equivalent quality and yield of an alternative strategy with two
spot specimens at consultation.
