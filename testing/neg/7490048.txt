Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at an
increased risk of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Disseminated
cutaneous tuberculosis is rare, but has been reported in four HIV-positive
patients, all of whom also had pulmonary infection. In this report we describe an
HIV-infected patient with a febrile illness and an abnormal chest radiograph who 
developed widespread cutaneous tuberculous pustules following a lymph node biopsy
on the previous day.
