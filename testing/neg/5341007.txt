Rapid identification of tick-borne encephalitis virus by the fluorescent antibody
technique.

Albrecht P, Kozuch O.

An immunofluorescence technique in tissue cultures and in mice, developed to
provide a rapid means of identification of group B arboviruses, has been used to 
identify the tick-borne encephalitis virus. Identification in mouse-brain tissue 
was not possible when mice with vague clinical symptoms were used. Identification
in chick-embryo-cell cultures was less time-consuming and laborious than
identification in mouse brain, but more care was required, since only a small
percentage of cells showed fluorescence. Identification can be accomplished in a 
few hours if mice in agony or cell cultures three to five days after inoculation 
are used.
