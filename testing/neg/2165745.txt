Four patients from 4 to 24 years of age (3 males, 1 female) with generalized
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and intermittent fever associated with
chronic active Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were investigated. Laboratory
data showed polyclonal gammopathy and a tendency for bone marrow suppression.
Noteworthy were the extremely elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers to 
Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen (VCA) (range, 10,240-81,920) and early antigen 
(EA) (range, 1,280-40,960). All patients had IgA antibodies to VCA and EA.
Subtle, heterogeneous immune functional defects were observed in all four
patients. Another unusual feature was our inability to establish spontaneous or
B95-8 EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) due to a marked
cytopathic effect (CPE). Thus, we investigated for other viruses. Both IgG and
IgM antibodies to adenovirus type-2 (Ad-2) were positive by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence (IF) test, suggesting recent
or activated Ad-2 infection had occurred. Dual active EBV and Ad-2 infections
were likely etiologic in this severe chronic active EBV infection syndrome.
