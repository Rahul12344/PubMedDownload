A case of isolated necrotizing cytomegalovirus (CMV) oophoritis disclosed only by
necropsy studies in a patient with AIDS, is described. This unusual case report
is discussed with a review of the literature dealing with CMV involvement of
genital organs in the immunocompromised host, and in patients with HIV infection 
and AIDS.
