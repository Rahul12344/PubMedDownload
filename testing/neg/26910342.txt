The role of the reactive oxygen species-producing NADPH oxidase family of enzymes
in the pathology of influenza A virus infection remains enigmatic. Previous
reports implicated NADPH oxidase 2 in influenza A virus-induced inflammation. In 
contrast, NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) was reported to decrease inflammation in mice
within 7 days post-influenza A virus infection. However, the effect of NADPH
oxidase 1 on lethality and adaptive immunity after influenza A virus challenge
has not been explored. Here we report improved survival and decreased morbidity
in mice with catalytically inactive NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1*/Y) compared with
controls after challenge with A/PR/8/34 influenza A virus. While changes in lung 
inflammation were not obvious between Nox1*/Y and control mice, we observed
alterations in the T cell response to influenza A virus by day 15 post-infection,
including increased interleukin-7 receptor-expressing virus-specific CD8+ T cells
in lungs and draining lymph nodes of Nox1*/Y, and increased cytokine-producing T 
cells in lungs and spleen. Furthermore, a greater percentage of conventional and 
interstitial dendritic cells from Nox1*/Y draining lymph nodes expressed the
co-stimulatory ligand CD40 within 6 days post-infection. Results indicate that
NADPH oxidase 1 modulates the innate and adaptive cellular immune response to
influenza virus infection, while also playing a role in host survival. Results
suggest that NADPH oxidase 1 inhibitors may be beneficial as adjunct therapeutics
during acute influenza infection.
