Developing a vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses an
exceptional challenge. There are no documented cases of immune-mediated clearance
of HIV from an infected individual, and no known correlates of immune protection.
Although nonhuman primate models of lentivirus infection have provided valuable
data about HIV pathogenesis, such models do not predict HIV vaccine efficacy in
humans. The combined lack of a predictive animal model and undefined biomarkers
of immune protection against HIV necessitate that vaccines to this pathogen be
tested directly in clinical trials. Adaptive clinical trial designs can
accelerate vaccine development by rapidly screening out poor vaccines while
extending the evaluation of efficacious ones, improving the characterization of
promising vaccine candidates and the identification of correlates of immune
protection.
