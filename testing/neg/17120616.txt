In many studies, ErbB4 expression in breast tumor samples correlates with a
favorable patient prognosis. Similarly, ErbB4 signaling is coupled to cellular
differentiation and growth arrest in a variety of model systems. However, in some
studies, ErbB4 expression in breast tumor samples correlates with poor outcome.
Likewise, studies using some human mammary tumor cell lines suggest that ErbB4 is
coupled to malignant phenotypes. Thus, the roles that ErbB4 plays in human breast
cancer are still poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that a constitutively active
ErbB4 mutant (ErbB4-Q646C) inhibits colony formation on plastic by two human
mammary tumor cell lines (SKBR3 and MCF7) and by the MCF10A immortalized human
mammary cell line, but does not inhibit colony formation by the MDA-MB-453 and
T47D human mammary tumor cell lines. ErbB4 kinase activity is necessary for ErbB4
function and phosphorylation of ErbB4 Tyr1056 is necessary and appears to be
sufficient for ErbB4 function. The inhibition of colony formation by MCF10A cells
is accompanied by growth arrest but not cell death. These data suggest that ErbB4
behaves as a mammary tumor suppressor and that loss of ErbB4 coupling to growth
arrest may be an important event in mammary tumorigenesis.
