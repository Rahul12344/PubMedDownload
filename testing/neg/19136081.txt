Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infects human hepatocytes already infected with the
hepatitis B virus increasing about ten fold the risk of cirrhosis and fulminant
hepatitis. The lack of an appropriate cell culture system capable of supporting
virus replication has so far impaired the detailed investigation of the HDV
biology including the identification of host factors involved in pathogenesis.
Here, we made use of a HDV cDNA stably transfected cell line, Huh7-D12, in a
proteomic approach to identify the changes in the protein expression profiles in 
human liver cells that arise as a consequence of HDV replication. Total protein
extracts from Huh7-D12 cells and of the corresponding non transfected human liver
carcinoma cell line, Huh7, were separated by 2-DE. Differentially expressed spots
were identified by MALDI-TOF followed by database searching. We identified 23
differentially expressed proteins of which 15 were down regulated and 8 up
regulated in Huh7-D12 cells. These proteins were found to be involved in
different cellular pathways. The down regulation of the histone H1-binding
protein and of triosephosphate isomerase was confirmed by Real time PCR, and the 
up regulation of the La protein and lamin A/C was validated by western blot.
