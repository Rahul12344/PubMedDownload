INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis is expressed in genetically susceptible persons 
randomly affected by an unknown environmental factor, probably a virus, which
sets off an abnormal immune process.
DEVELOPMENT AND CONCLUSION: Race is an important predictive risk factor for
multiple sclerosis, but genetics alone do not explain the occurrence of this
disease. The genetic predisposition is complex, since several loci are involved
in the susceptibility. Probably the immune process seen in multiple sclerosis is 
a consequence not a cause. The cause is possibly unique and due to infection. The
causative agent may be rare or on the contrary may be frequent, but has different
biological effects on susceptible persons. Epidemiology alone is not sufficient
to find the cause. This requires collaboration from the basic sciences (genetics,
microbiology, etc.). The results of epidemiological methods would be much
improved if a biological marker for the disease was available.
