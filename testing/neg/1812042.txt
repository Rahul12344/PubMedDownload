Antibodies to the preS2 antigen (anti-preS2) of the hepatitis B virus (HBV),
including IgA, IgM and IgG classes, were observed in patients with acute and
persistent HBV infection. In acute HBV infection, rapid and marked serum IgM and 
IgA anti-preS2 responses were observed. Antibodies reached a peak of serum
activity at about 1-2 months after the onset of clinical symptoms, and both
antibodies disappeared from serum at 4 months after. IgG anti-preS2 was detected 
in the early phase of the illness, then the level of IgG anti-preS2 gradually
rose during the recovery phase. In persistent HBV infection, IgG and IgM
anti-preS2 were detected in sera where the preS2 antigen was present, and IgM
anti-preS2 was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in HBeAg-positive than in 
HBeAg-negative patients. These results indicate that an adequate humoral immune
response to the preS2 antigen is induced during acute and persistent HBV
infection.
