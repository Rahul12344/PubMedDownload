AIM: The effect of GSTM1 and GSTT1 allelic polymorphisms was studied on the
HPV-induced cervical carcinogenesis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty-three women with persistent high-risk
HPV infection were involved in the study; 117 of them developed cervical
high-grade dysplasia and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III during
the 7-year follow-up period. Occurrence of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes was
compared between women with and without dysplasia.
RESULTS: Presence of GSTM1 (OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.06-2.97; p=0.028) and GSTT1
(OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.10-3.26; p=0.022) null genotypes was statistically
significantly more frequent among women with cervical dysplasia than in the group
without dysplasia. Participants with dual null genotype had an even more elevated
risk of precancerous lesion (OR=2.35, 95% CI=1.17-4.73; p=0.017).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the role of both GSTM1 and T1 null genotypes
in the development of high-grade cervical dysplasia in a Caucasian population.
