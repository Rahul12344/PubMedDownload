Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major public health problem in the South Asian
countries including India. Pigs serve as a relevant sentinel model, the
surveillance of which could predict a potential JE outbreak in human population
nearby. However, existing serological detection methods like Enzyme-Linked Immuno
Sorbent Assay (ELISA), virus neutralization test (VNT) and Haemagglutination
Inhibition (HI) require elaborative laboratory facilities which are invariably
not available in field conditions. Recognizing the lacunae, attempts were made to
develop recombinant antigen (rNS1) based latex agglutination test (LAT) as a
rapid on-site test using covalent coupling method. Four different formats were
evaluated using different coupling buffers, blocking buffers and reaction
conditions. The format in which borate buffer at alkaline pH (8.5) was used for
coupling of antigen with carboxylated beads followed by blocking with skimmed
milk powder was found to be the best amongst all. Developed latex based test was 
used for screening of 207 pig serum samples for JE which revealed relative
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80.2% and 95.2%, respectively in
comparison with indirect IgG ELISA. Hence, the present study demonstrated that
covalently coupled recombinant antigen based LAT could be used as a reliable
screening test for surveillance of JE in pigs under field conditions.
