Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein is known to regulate the 
expression of proteins via binding to an RNA site termed the HIV Rev response
element (RRE) presumably with a defined shape, mediated mainly by electrostatic
interactions. We have developed a quantitative method based on CE-LIF detection
for a systematic evaluation of interactions between a truncated RRE (tRRE) RNA
and an HIV-1 Rev peptide. Employing a fluorescently labeled HIV-1 Rev protein
fragment (RevF) as a probe, buffers were evaluated for the separation and
detection as well as for the RNA shape-specific formation of the complex.
Selection of an optimal buffer condition allowed us to perform quantitation of
the tRRE-RevF complex formation and determine its dissociation constant. In
addition, competitive inhibitions of the RNA-peptide interaction by some
aminoglycosides were evaluated quantitatively by monitoring the complex peak,
resulting in determination of IC(50) values. This sensitive and reliable
CE-LIF-based method would be of interest in developing various screening systems 
for RNA interference in drug discovery.
