The role of Fas-mediated lysis of hepatocytes in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced 
injury is frequently discussed. We therefore analyzed the effect of the number of
HCV antigen-expressing cells, the mode of antigen presentation, and the number of
cytotoxic T lymphocytes in a coculture system mimicking cellular components of
the liver. Here, we show that endogenously processed HCV proteins are capable of 
inducing bystander killing. We further demonstrate that 0.8 to 1.5% of cells
presenting HCV antigens suffice to induce lysis of 10 to 29% of bystander cells, 
suggesting that the mechanism may be operative at low fractions of infected
versus uninfected hepatocytes in vivo. Our data underscore the role of the Fas
pathway in HCV-related liver injury and support the exploration of Fas-based
treatment strategies for patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.
