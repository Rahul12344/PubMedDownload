BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir (DTG; S/GSK1349572), a human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1) integrase inhibitor, has limited cross-resistance to raltegravir (RAL) 
and elvitegravir in vitro. This phase IIb study assessed the activity of DTG in
HIV-1-infected subjects with genotypic evidence of RAL resistance.
METHODS: Subjects received DTG 50 mg once daily (cohort I) or 50 mg twice daily
(cohort II) while continuing a failing regimen (without RAL) through day 10,
after which the background regimen was optimized, when feasible, for cohort I,
and at least 1 fully active drug was mandated for cohort II. The primary efficacy
end point was the proportion of subjects on day 11 in whom the plasma HIV-1 RNA
load decreased by ≥0.7 log(10) copies/mL from baseline or was <400 copies/mL.
RESULTS: A rapid antiviral response was observed. More subjects achieved the
primary end point in cohort II (23 of 24 [96%]), compared with cohort I (21 of 27
[78%]) at day 11. At week 24, 41% and 75% of subjects had an HIV-1 RNA load of
<50 copies/mL in cohorts I and II, respectively. Further integrase genotypic
evolution was uncommon. Dolutegravir had a good, similar safety profile with each
dosing regimen.
CONCLUSION: Dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily with an optimized background provided 
greater and more durable benefit than the once-daily regimen. These data are the 
first clinical demonstration of the activity of any integrase inhibitor in
subjects with HIV-1 resistant to RAL.
