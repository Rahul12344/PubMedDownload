BACKGROUND: At the onset of the pandemic H1N1/09 influenza A outbreak in
Australia, health authorities devised official clinical case definitions to guide
testing and access to antiviral therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of these case definitions and to
attempt to improve on them using a scoring system based on clinical findings at
presentation.
PATIENTS/METHODS: This study is a retrospective case-control study across three
metropolitan Melbourne hospitals and one associated community-based clinic during
the influenza season, 2009. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness who
were tested for H1N1/09 influenza A were administered a standard questionnaire of
symptomatology, comorbidities, and risk factors. Patients with a positive test
were compared to those with a negative test. Logistic regression was performed to
examine for correlation of clinical features with disease. A scoring system was
devised and compared with case definitions used during the pandemic. The main
outcome measures were the positive and negative predictive values of our scoring 
system, based on real-life data, versus the mandated case definitions'.
RESULTS: Both the devised scoring system and the case definitions gave similar
positive predictive values (38-58% using ascending score groups, against 39-44%
using the various case definitions). Negative predictive values were also closely
matched (ranging from 94% to 73% in the respective score groups against 83-84%
for the case definitions).
CONCLUSIONS: Accurate clinical diagnosis of H1N1/09 influenza A was difficult and
not improved significantly by a structured scoring system. Investment in more
widespread availability of rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests should be
considered in future pandemic planning.
