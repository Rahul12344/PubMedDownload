Interactions between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and c-Jun/c-Jun homodimer
(JUN) on the promoter DNA of mouse mammary tumor virus-long terminal repeat
(MMTV-LTR) are reported here using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay
(EMSA). Both GR and JUN are capable of independently binding to their respective 
response elements, including glucocorticoid response element (GRE) and phorbol
ester response element (TRE), on MMTV-LTR promoter. The protein-DNA complex,
assembled by pre-incubating JUN and DNA before the addition of GR, migrates
slower (supershift) on gel electrophoresis than do the complexes formed by the
other orders of addition. The formation of the supershifted complex is GR and JUN
dose-dependent. The supershift is not detected with the cleaved fragments of
MMTV-LTR promoter that separate GRE from TRE, indicating that the integrity of
the promoter and possibly the spacing between GRE and TRE are important. The
interaction of GR and JUN on the MMTV-LTR promoter appears to be more complex
than simple protein-protein interaction.
