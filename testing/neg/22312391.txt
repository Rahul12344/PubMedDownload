Hepatitis C virus infection is an emerging disease and a public health problem in
the world. There are accumulating data regarding extra hepatic manifestation of
HCV, such as rheumatologic manifestations, endocrine, hematologic, dermatologic, 
renal, neurologic, and systemic manifestations. The therapy of them needs more
attention to some exacerbations of extra hepatic manifestation and in some
situation it needs different approaches. In this review we tried to provide
latest evidence for extra hepatic manifestation and management of them.
