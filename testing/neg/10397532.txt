OBJECTIVES: To determine whether the CD28-CD8+ T cells that develop during HIV
infection contain HIV-specific cytotoxic precursor cells.
DESIGN: CD8 subpopulations from six asymptomatic HIV-positive adults, with
varying degrees of CD4 T cell loss, were sorted by flow cytometry and
HIV-specific precursor cytotoxic T lymphocyte frequencies were measured. Three
populations of CD8 T cells were tested: CD28+CD5-- T cells, CD28-CD57+ T cells
(thought to be memory cells) and CD28-CD57- T cells (function unknown).
METHODS: Sorted CD8 subsets were stimulated with antigen presenting cells
expressing HIV-1 Gag/Pol molecules. Cytotoxic T cell assays on Gag/Pol expressing
51Cr-labeled Epstein-Barr virus transformed autologous B cells lines or control
targets were performed after 2 weeks. Specific lysis and precursor frequencies
were calculated.
RESULTS: Both CD28 positive and CD28-CD57+ populations contained appreciable
numbers of precursors (9-1720 per 10(6) CD8+ T cells). However, the CD28-CD57-
population had fewer precursors in five out of six people studied. More CD28
positive HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors were found in patients
with CD4:CD8 ratios > 1, whereas more CD28-CD57+ precursors were found in
patients whose CD4:CD8 ratios were < 1 (r2, 0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: Memory HIV-specific precursor cytotoxic T lymphocytes are found in
both CD28 positive and CD28-CD8+ cells, however, a CD28-CD57- subpopulation had
fewer. Because CD28-CD57+ cells are antigen-driven with limited diversity, the
loss of CD28 on CD8 T cells during disease progression may reduce the response to
new HIV mutations; this requires further testing.
