Blood was collected from bison that were selected between 1991 and 2001 for poor 
body condition, cachexia, lameness and balanoposthitis. Sera were tested for
antibodies to bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus
(BVDV), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), parainfluenza virus type 3 (PI-3),
Brucella abortus, Chlamydophila abortus, Coxiella burnetti, and Leptospira
interrogans. The results of serological tests showed a prevalence of low titers
of a serological reaction to Chlamydophila abortus (45.1%), bovine viral
diarrhoea virus (29.5%), Leptospira interrogans (21.3%) and parainfluenza virus
type 3 (13.9%). There were differences in the prevalence of antibodies to Ch.
abortus between female and male bison. Futhermore, a relationship between age and
antibodies to BVDV was observed in older bison. These results suggest that there 
is some transmission of bacterial and viral pathogens occurring between domestic 
and wild ruminants grazing in the same pastures in the peripherial areas of
Bialowieza Primeval Forest.
