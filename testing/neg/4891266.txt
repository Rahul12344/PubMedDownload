Intraphagocytic degradation of group A streptococci: electron microsopic studies.

Ayoub EM, White JG.

The morphological changes that occur during intraphagocytic digestion of group A 
streptococci were studied by electron microscopy The first evidence of
degradation of the ingested organism was the appearance of reticular changes in
the bacterial endoplasm. This was followed by gradual swelling and dissolution of
the bacterial wall, with final degradation of all the constitutuents to
electron-dense debris. Accompanying changes in the phagocytic cell were observed;
they consisted of vacuole formation, fusion of lysosomes with the wall of the
yacuole, release of the lysosomal contents into the vacuole, and aggregation of
the lysosomal contents around the ingested organism. Changes in the morphology of
the organism similar to those observed during intraphagocytic digestion were also
obtained by subjecting streptococcal cells to the action of the phage-associated 
lysin.
