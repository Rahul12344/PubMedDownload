With the wide availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), genetic mapping has 
become the rate-limiting step, inhibiting unbiased forward genetics in even the
most tractable model organisms. We introduce a rapid deconvolution resource and
method for untagged causative mutations after mutagenesis, screens, and WGS in
Escherichia coli. We created Deconvoluter-ordered libraries with selectable
insertions every 50 kb in the E. coli genome. The Deconvoluter method uses these 
for replacement of untagged mutations in the genome using a phage-P1-based
gene-replacement strategy. We validate the Deconvoluter resource by deconvolution
of 17 of 17 phenotype-altering mutations from a screen of
N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mutants. The Deconvoluter resource permits rapid
unbiased screens and gene/function identification and will enable exploration of 
functions of essential genes and undiscovered genes/sites/alleles not represented
in existing deletion collections. This resource for unbiased forward-genetic
screens with mapping-by-sequencing ('forward genomics') demonstrates a strategy
that could similarly enable rapid screens in many other microbes.
