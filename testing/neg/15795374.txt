Bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase (gene 5 protein, gp5) interacts with its
processivity factor, Escherichia coli thioredoxin, via a unique loop at the tip
of the thumb subdomain. We find that this thioredoxin-binding domain is also the 
site of interaction of the phage-encoded helicase/primase (gp4) and ssDNA binding
protein (gp2.5). Thioredoxin itself interacts only weakly with gp4 and gp2.5 but 
drastically enhances their binding to gp5. The acidic C termini of gp4 and gp2.5 
are critical for this interaction in the absence of DNA. However, the C-terminal 
tail of gp4 is not required for binding to gp5 when the latter is bound to a
primer/template. We propose that the thioredoxin-binding domain is a molecular
switch that regulates the interaction of T7 DNA polymerase with other proteins of
the replisome.
