Biliary cryptosporidiosis was studied by inoculation of 2 x 10(5) Cryptosporidium
baileyi oocysts (AU-B1 isolate) into the gall bladders of ten 6-day-old broiler
chickens. Clinical signs of disease were not seen. Three of the 10 chickens
developed biliary tract infections, based on histologic examination of tissue
sections. Lesions seen in the gall bladders of these birds included epithelial
hyperplasia and infiltration of the underlying connective tissue with mononuclear
leukocytes. One of these birds also had involvement of the hepatic bile ducts.
The bile ducts were mildly dilated and contained lesions similar to those seen in
the gall bladder. Few to many cryptosporidia were present in the gall bladders
and bile ducts of infected birds. Chickens may be of use in the study of biliary 
cryptosporidiosis, a common sequel to enteric infection in humans with human
immunodeficiency virus infection.
