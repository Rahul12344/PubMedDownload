Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) is a rare tumour of T-lymphocytes that is
associated with human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection as well as 
severe/refractory hypercalcaemia. Human immunodefficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
infected individuals are at increased risk of acquiring co-infection with HTLV-1.
We present the case of a 37 -year -old HIV-1 positive and antiretroviral therapy 
naive woman who was admitted to the ICU with delirium, a generalised
maculopapular rash, severe hypercalcaemia of 4.48 mmol/L (normal < 2.7 mmol/L)
and a positive HTLV-1 serology. The diagnosis of ATLL was confirmed on biopsy.
Her hypercalcaemic state proved refractory to conventional therapy, but was
rapidly corrected with a modified haemodialysis technique using a dialysate with 
a low low-calcium concentration.
