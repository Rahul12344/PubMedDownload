Schmallenberg virus (SBV) circulation was investigated in 25 previously exposed
dairy herds in Ireland in 2016. A population of 1,550 spring-2014-born animals,
which had been monitored for SBV infection in 2014 and 2015 as part of a previous
SBV surveillance study, were resampled for evidence of SBV infection during 2016.
A total of 366 blood samples were collected in the 25 study herds (15 samples per
herd) between 3 March 2017 and 10 March 2017 (before the 2017 vector-active
season) and analysed for SBV antibodies using a competitive ELISA kit (IDVet). A 
total of 256 animals tested seropositive, an AP of 69.9% (95% CI: 65.1-74.4) and 
TP of 77.7% (95% CI: 72.3%-82.8%) when correcting for imperfect test
characteristics. These results demonstrate that a new epidemic of SBV circulation
occurred in these previously exposed herds in Ireland in 2016.
