Introduction: Tuberculosis is the second leading cause of death under the
category of infectious diseases, after the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) constitutes about 5% of all extrapulmonary disease
worldwide. This report describes a case of Tuberculous meningitis with rare
presentation in a 28-year-old woman, who was treated based on a collection of her
social background, clinical findings and Multiplex PCR of tuberculosis.
Case presentation: A 28-year-old Malay woman with no significant medical history 
presented to HUSM with one month history of on and off fever, two weeks history
of generalised limbs weakness and one week history of dysphagia. She was reported
to have experienced visual hallucination and significant weight loss. Her
laboratory result is significant for leukocytosis, elevated ESR and
hypernatremia. Non-enhanced and contrast CT scan of the brain showed severe
bilateral frontal cerebral atrophy. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for multiplex PCR
for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was positive. She was promptly started on 
anti-TB regime combined with dexamethasone. Subsequent follow-up showed
significant improvement.
Conclusion: This is a rare clinical manifestation of Tuberculous meningitis that 
demonstrates the importance of recognising and initiating the treatment early to 
reduce disabilities and improve clinical outcome.
