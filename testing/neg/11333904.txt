Adenovirus vectors have been studied as vehicles for gene transfer to skeletal
muscle, an attractive target for gene therapies for inherited and acquired
diseases. In this setting, immune responses to viral proteins and/or transgene
products cause inflammation and lead to loss of transgene expression. A few
studies in murine models have suggested that the destructive cell-mediated immune
response to virally encoded proteins of E1-deleted adenovirus may not contribute 
to the elimination of transgene-expressing cells. However, the impact of immune
responses following intramuscular administration of adenovirus vectors on
transgene stability has not been elucidated in larger animal models such as
nonhuman primates. Here we demonstrate that intramuscular administration of
E1-deleted adenovirus vector expressing rhesus monkey erythropoietin or growth
hormone to rhesus monkeys results in generation of a Th1-dependent cytotoxic
T-cell response to adenovirus proteins. Transgene expression dropped
significantly over time but was still detectable in some animals after 6 months. 
Systemic levels of adenovirus-specific neutralizing antibodies were generated,
which blocked vector readministration. These studies indicate that the cellular
and humoral immune response generated to adenovirus proteins, in the context of
transgenes encoding self-proteins, hinders long-term transgene expression and
readministration with first-generation vectors.
