OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intrapartum
prophylactic antibiotics in the prevention of postpartum sepsis in laboring women
who were infected with HIV.
STUDY DESIGN: In a double-blind, randomized trial that was conducted in Durban
(South Africa), pregnant women who were infected with HIV in whom vaginal
delivery was anticipated were randomized to receive either a single dose of
cefoxitin (2 g) or placebo intrapartum. Signs of sepsis were evaluated within 72 
hours and at 1 and 2 weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: Of the 424 women who were enrolled, 213 women received cefoxitin, and
211 women received placebo. Both groups were comparable in all baseline
parameters. The overall sepsis rate was 19% (40/211 women) in the placebo group
and 16.9% (36/213 women) in the cefoxitin group (P = .581). There was a 53%
reduction in risk of postpartum endometritis in the cefoxitin group (95%
confidence interval, 0.24-0.9).
CONCLUSION: The use of prophylactic intrapartum cefoxitin in HIV-infected women
reduces the risk of postpartum endometritis.
