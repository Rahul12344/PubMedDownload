Yellow fever virus. II. Factors affecting the plaque neutralization test.

Spector SL, Tauraso NM.

In studies on the factors and conditions influencing the yellow fever (YF) virus 
plaque neutralization test, 60 min was found to be the minimal time necessary for
equilibration of the virus-antibody complex at 23 and 37 C. Maximal virus titers 
in the diluent controls and the pre- and postinoculation serum-containing
mixtures occurred by the 60-min adsorption time. Serum neutralization indices
also seemed to level by this time. Heating (56 C for 30 min) decreased the
neutralizing capacity of serum. However, the slope of the neutralization curve
was not affected. The addition of native (unheated) "serum factor" in the form of
fresh guinea pig or monkey sera partially restored the neutralizing activity lost
by heating in some, but not all, sera. Many sera contained nonspecific inhibitors
of YF virus infectivity and neutralization. Preliminary studies with ether
extraction suggest that these inhibitors are lipid in nature.
