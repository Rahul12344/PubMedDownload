BACKGROUND & AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess changes in the clinical
pattern of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection in Italy, brought about by improved 
control of hepatitis B and D viruses, and to establish the natural history of
chronic hepatitis D.
METHODS: Histological diagnosis and clinical features of 122 patients with HDV
recruited from 1987 to 1996 in three Italian tertiary referral centers (Torino,
northern Italy; San Giovanni Rotondo and Castellana Grotte, southern Italy) were 
compared with those of 162 patients collected in the same centers in the previous
decade. Patients from both groups with at least 6 months of follow-up were
included in a new subgroup to assess the natural history of the disease.
RESULTS: Among 162 patients referred from 1977 to 1986, 9 (6%) had mild hepatitis
at histology vs. 9 (8%) of 122 patients referred in the second decade; 105 (65%) 
vs. 21 (17%) had severe hepatitis; 46 (28%) vs. 38 (31%) had histological
asymptomatic cirrhosis; and 2 (1%) vs. 54 (44%) had clinically overt cirrhosis.
For 159 patients (121 men and 38 women; mean age, 34 +/- 11), a follow-up of more
than 6 months was documented, and they were included in the natural history
subgroup. After 78 +/- 59 months of follow-up, 112 (70%) survived free of liver
transplantation: 9 underwent transplantation, 32 died of liver failure, and 6 of 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Estimated 5- and 10-year probability of
survival free of orthotopic liver transplantation was 100% and 100% for patients 
with mild hepatitis, 90% and 90% for severe hepatitis, 81% and 58% for
histological asymptomatic cirrhosis, and 49% and 40% for clinical cirrhosis (P < 
0.01), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Occurrence of fresh and severe forms of hepatitis D has diminished
greatly in Italy. Contemporary patients represent cohorts infected years ago who 
survived the immediate medical impact of hepatitis D. The disease has been
asymptomatic and nonprogressive in a minority; in the majority, it rapidly
advanced to cirrhosis but thereafter subsided with stable clinical conditions for
more than a decade.
