This paper reports the failure of a patient suffering from Epidermodysplasia
verruciformis, characterised by widespread infection of the skin with human
papillomaviruses, to respond to topical and systemic treatment with the antiviral
agent, Cidofovir, despite its previously demonstrated effectiveness against a
range of different papillomavirus-associated conditions.
