Detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus antibodies. II. Use of fractionated
bovine antisera for improving the specificity of a "passive" hemagglutination
test.

Warrington RE, Kawakami Y.

Because 7S immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies of low type specificity were present 
in mixtures with highly specific 19S IgM antibodies, many bovine antisera to
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A(12), strain 119 cross-reacted with
type O of FMDV and to some degree with type C in the passive hemagglutination
(HA) test. After 19S IgM antibodies were separated by density gradient
centrifugation or precipitated with 4% (w/v) polyethylene glycol, the antigen
could be determined with "block" HA tests. Such tests used several antigen
concentrations in the titration of each antiserum. Adding 4% (w/v) polyethylene
glycol to the serum was especially convenient for rapid precipitation of 19S IgM 
antibodies for the test. Similar results were obtained with bovine 19S IgM
antibodies to FMDV type O, subtype 1, strain Caseros and type C strain Rezende.
