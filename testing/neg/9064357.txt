More than 90% of adults are latently infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the 
causative agent of infectious mononucleosis, a self-limiting lymphoproliferative 
disease characterized by extensive T cell activation. Reactivation of this
herpesvirus during immunosuppression is often associated with oncogenesis. These 
considerations led us to analyze the early events that occur after exposure of
the immune system to EBV. Strong major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II-dependent but not MHC-restricted, T cell proliferation was observed in vitro
in response to autologous, lytically infected EBV-transformed B cells. By
measuring the appearance of the early activation marker CD69 on individual T cell
V beta subsets, we could demonstrate selective activation of human V beta 13- T
cells. This was confirmed with murine T cell hybridomas expressing various human 
BV genes. While EBV- Burkitt's lymphoma cells were nonstimulatory, they induced V
beta-restricted T cell activation after EBV infection. EBV specific activation
was also demonstrated in cord blood cells, excluding a recall-antigen response.
Thus, all of the characteristics of a superantigen-stimulated response are seen, 
indicating that induction of the EBV lytic cycle is associated with the
expression of a superantigen in B cells. A model is presented proposing a role
for the superantigen in infection, latency, and oncogenesis.
