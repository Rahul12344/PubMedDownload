Detection of double-stranded RNA by serologically specific electron microscopy.

Derrick KS, French RC, Clark CA, Gabriel CJ.

Details of a procedure for detecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in virus and
viroid infected tissue extracts using serologically specific electron microscopy 
are given. A method for staining dsRNA, based on in situ formation of uranyl
phosphate, that consistently permits the examination of dsRNA by electron
microscopy without shadowing with heavy metals, is described. The method provides
for routine assays for dsRNA in crude extracts without the variable results
associated with shadowing procedures. DsRNA was found to accumulate in older
leaves of sorghum systemically infected with sugarcane mosaic virus. In contrast,
dsRNA was not detected in older cowpea leaves systemically infected with cowpea
mosaic virus but was readily found in inoculated leaves 4 days post inoculation
and young systemically infected leaves.
