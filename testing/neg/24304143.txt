Oral malignancy is rare in chimpanzees. A 34-year-old female chimpanzee (Pan
troglodytes) at Kumamoto Sanctuary, Japan, had developed it. Treatment is
technically difficult for chimpanzees while malignant neoplasm is seemingly
rising in captive populations. Widespread expert discussion, guidelines for
treatment, especially for great apes in terminal stages is urgently needed.
