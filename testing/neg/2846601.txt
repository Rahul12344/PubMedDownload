A rapid quantitative assay was developed to determine cytomegalovirus infectious 
units. The assay yielded results in three days. The rapid quantitation of
cytomegalovirus infectivity was developed by evaluating the number of cells that 
expressed cytomegalovirus-late antigens at the end of a single replication cycle 
(62 h post-infection). Late antigens were visualized by immunoalkaline
phosphatase staining using a monoclonal antibody against the major viral capsid
protein (66.8 kDa). Thirty-five cytomegalovirus samples were examined. The values
of the infectious units obtained by immunoalkaline phosphatase staining were
correlated significantly with the values determined by the classical
plaque-forming technique.
