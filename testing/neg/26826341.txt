Long noncoding (lnc)RNAs comprise a diverse group of transcripts including large 
intervening noncoding (linc)RNAs, natural antisense transcripts (NATs) and
intronic lncRNAs. The functions and mechanisms of more than 200 lncRNAs have been
studied in vitro and the results suggest that lncRNAs may be molecular markers of
prognosis in cancer patients. Some lncRNAs can promote virus replication and
allow escape from cytosolic surveillance to suppress antiviral immunity. For
example, lncRNA can cause persistent infection by Theiler's virus, and microRNA
(miR)-27a/b is important for efficient murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) replication.
The available evidence suggests that lncRNAs may be potential targets of novel
antiviral drugs.
