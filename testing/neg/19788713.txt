OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of trans-electric nerve
stimulation (TENS) for phantom limb pain applied to contralateral limb
(nonamputated limb).
DESIGN: Two detailed single case studies using TENS on the contralateral limb are
reported in a longitudinal study with one-year follow-up. Five variables were
measured across this period. The study comprised of five sequential stages
(Pre-assessment, Preliminary baseline, Start of intervention, Extended
assessment, One-year follow-up).
SETTING AND PATIENTS: Patients were identified at the Rookwood Hospital in
Cardiff. They subsequently received regular home visits. The first patient was a 
24-year-old male who had suffered a left below-elbow amputation following a car
crash. The second patient was a 38-year-old male who had a transfemoral right
amputation further to a viral infection.
MEASURES: The following semistructured interview and questionnaires were used:
McGill Comprehensive pain questionnaire part A and B; The Cambridge Phantom Limb 
Profile; The Groningen Questionnaire: Problems after Arm Amputation; and 13
Visual Analog Scales.
CONCLUSIONS: Both patients showed a significant improvement in their perception
of phantom limb pain and sensations that was maintained at one-year follow-up. A 
randomized blinded controlled trial to confirm these positive outcomes is
required.
