Structure at restriction endonuclease MboI cleavage sites protected by
actinomycin D or distamycin A.

Nilsson MG, Skarped C, Magnusson G.

Restriction endonuclease MboI cleavage of DNA was inhibited by actinomycin D and 
distamycin A. The two inhibitors protected different subsets of the 8 cleavage
sites in polyoma DNA. The cleavage reactions were analyzed both in the presence
of minimal inhibitory concentrations of the compounds and at higher
concentrations, allowing cleavage at only 1 site/DNA molecule. The experiments
showed that cleavage sites most efficiently protected by actinomycin D had
putative inhibitor binding sites at a distance of 1-2 base pairs from the MboI
recognition sequence. Distamycin A, in contrast, apparently has to bind
immediately adjacent to the MboI recognition sequence to protect from cleavage.
