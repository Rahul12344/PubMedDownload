Fifty (50) samples of genital secretions are collected from young girls between
1983 and 1994 at Albert Royer Hospital (Dakar, Senegal), to research pathogenic
strains. Each sample were studied by microscopic examination and culture in
several media after enrichment. 70% of the samples are positive of specific
agents (37.25%), particularly Candida albicans (19.6%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae was
found among the elders. This retrospective study shows the rarity of specific
agents of genital infections generally isolated among the adults. The authors
were not able to research other agents as Chlamydia trachomatis or viruses.
