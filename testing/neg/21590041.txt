Interference of papilloma viruses with p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic
pathways.

Bauer G.

Papillomavirus infection interferes with four distinct and dominant levels of
intra- and intercellular control of oncogenesis, three of which are based on the 
induction of apoptosis. Papillomaviruses cause abrogation of the cellular
senescence program and interfere with p53-dependent DNA repair or apoptosis
triggered by DNA damage. As a result, spontaneous or induced mutations are not
eradicated and the transformed state may be established through oncogene
activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation. The interference of
papillomaviruses with a recently described p53-independent intercellular control 
step, in which nontransformed cells induce apoptosis specifically in their
transformed neighbouring cells, allows survival of papillomavirus-expressing
transformed cells. Finally, p53-dependent hypoxia-triggered apoptosis in
microtumors may be overcome by papillomaviruses and thus lead to efficient and
rapid tumor progression.
