The risk of germ contamination through already used dental replacement cannot or 
only with difficulties be solved by disinfection. As to new dental replacements, 
which may constitute a germ vehicle between the dental laboratory and the dental 
office, specific consequences can be drawn. It is tried to explain where
contamination may start so that such contamination can be prevented.
