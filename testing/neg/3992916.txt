[Newcastle disease virus carrier state following the aerosol immunization of
chickens against the disease using different doses of La Sota vaccine].

[Article in Bulgarian]

Naneva G.

Six experiments were carried out with aerosol immunization, using various doses
of the La Sota vaccine against Newcastle disease, and a control infection with
massive amounts of the viscerotropic virus strain Pavlikeni to evaluate the
duration of carrying the Newcastle disease virus. The aerosol vaccination of the 
birds was performed in laboratory conditions in an aerosol chamber of a
flow-dynamic type of 450 l. The amount of the virus in the aerosol was determined
through virologic investigations of samples taken by means of a glass capillary
impinger. It was found that a short-term carrier state set in up to the 9th-10th 
day with the La Sota strain, regardless of the dose used and the age of the
birds. The persistence of the velogenic virus in the organs of birds depended on 
the amount of vaccine used and the age of the birds. With 2-month-old chickens at
optimal dosing of the vaccine resistance could be built up to the infection. When
low doses of the vaccine were used with 10-day-old chicks as well as when
over-dosing occurred the strain Pavlikeni could be recovered from the organs in
the course of 3 to 7 days.
