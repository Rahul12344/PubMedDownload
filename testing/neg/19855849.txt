The present work describes a novel interaction between the human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein and the cellular lens epithelium-derived growth 
factor p75 (LEDGF/p75) protein in vitro and in virus-infected cells. Here we
show, for the first time, that formation of an Rev-LEDGF/p75 complex is a crucial
step in regulating viral cDNA integration. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments at
various times after virus infection revealed that, first, an integrase enzyme
(IN)-LEDGF/p75 complex is formed, which is then replaced by a Rev-LEDGF/p75 and
Rev-IN complexes. This was supported by in vitro experiments showing that Rev
promotes dissociation of the IN-LEDGF/p75 complex. Combination of the viral IN
and the cellular LEDGF/p75 is required for proper integration of the viral cDNA
into the host chromosomal DNA. Our findings demonstrate that integration of HIV-1
cDNA is regulated by an interplay between viral Rev and the host-cell LEDGF/p75
proteins.
