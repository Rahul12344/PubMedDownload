Quantification of measles virus antigens in infected CNS tissue: development of
an enzyme linked immunoassay.

Kabacoff CM, Carrigan DR.

An enzyme linked immunoassay procedure has been developed which allows accurate
quantification of low levels of measles virus antigens in infected central
nervous system (CNS) tissues. In its development a systematic study was made of
the effects of a large excess of nonviral proteins on the assay results. It was
found that controls using single proteins such as bovine serum albumin were
inadequate. Further, results indicate that experimental samples and viral antigen
standards must be closely matched for their content of CNS tissue proteins since 
such proteins exert distinctive quantitative effects, both dramatic and subtle.
