Comparative study of reactogenicity and immunogenicity of influenza A/New
Jersey/8/76 (Hsw1N1) virus vaccines in normal volunteers.

Betts RF, Douglas RG Jr.

Local and systemic reactions and antibody responses to three different doses of
influenza virus vaccine (A/New Jersey/76 [Hsw1N1]) produced by four different
manufacturers were studied. Local and systemic reactions that peaked between 8
and 24 hr after vaccine administration were related to the source of the vaccine 
more than to the dose. Antibody conversion occurred in almost 90% of subjects
over the age of 25 years but in only 61% of subjects 25 years or younger. This
low response rate was due almost entirely to the lack of response of volunteers
who received split-product vaccine (only 49% of subjects became seropositive). In
addition, individuals with symptoms of local reaction had a rate of antibody
conversion and magnitude of antibody response that were significantly higher than
those observed in subjects who did not have local reactions. These findings
suggest that in subjects older than 25 years, all four vaccines produced a high
frequency of antibody response with a minimum of side effects. In addition,
split-virus vaccine is less immunogenic than whole-virus vaccine in subjects
younger than 25 years. Production of a vaccine devoid of local reaction may not
be advisable.
