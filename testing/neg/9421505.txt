Vaccinia topoisomerase forms a covalent protein-DNA intermediate at 5'-CCCTT
downward arrow sites in duplex DNA. The T downward arrow nucleotide is linked via
a 3'-phosphodiester bond to Tyr-274 of the enzyme. Here, we report that mutant
enzymes containing glutamate, cysteine or histidine in lieu of Tyr-274 catalyze
endonucleolytic cleavage of a 60 bp duplex DNA at the CCCTT downward arrow site
to yield a 3' phosphate-terminated product. The Cys-274 mutant forms trace levels
of a covalent protein-DNA complex, suggesting that the DNA cleavage reaction may 
proceed through a cysteinyl-phosphate intermediate. However, the His-274 and
Glu-274 mutants evince no detectable accumulation of a covalent protein-DNA
adduct. Glu-274 is the most active of the mutants tested. The pH dependence of
the endonuclease activity of Glu-274 (optimum pH = 6.5) is distinct from that of 
the wild-type enzyme in hydrolysis of the covalent adduct (optimum pH = 9.5). At 
pH 6.5, the Glu-274 endonuclease reaction is slower by 5-6 orders of magnitude
than the rate of covalent adduct formation by the wild-type topoisomerase, but is
approximately 20 times faster than the rate of hydrolysis by the wild-type
covalent adduct. We discuss two potential mechanisms to account for the apparent 
conversion of a topoisomerase into an endonuclease.
