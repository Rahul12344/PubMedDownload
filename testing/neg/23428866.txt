Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) typically develops in the liver with chronic
hepatitis and cirrhosis, and activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes occurs during carcinogenesis via genetic and epigenetic
mechanisms. Recent advancements in the development of analyses for examining the 
cancer genome have revealed information regarding genetic alterations in HCC
tissues. According to previous studies, the incidence of recurrent genetic
alterations in individual genes was thought to be relatively rare and limited to 
a subset of a few cancer-specific genes such as tumor suppressor p53, RB genes
and oncogenes such as CTNNB1. However, recent whole-genome analyses and exome
sequencing of tumor DNA have revealed numerous novel alterations of
cancer-related genes and pathways critical for HCC development. In addition,
various risk factors for HCC, such as the presence or absence of hepatitis B and 
C virus, may affect the mutation profile of the corresponding cancer genome. On
the other hand, genome-wide association studies have also identified important
single-nucleotide polymorphisms involved in HCC development, which may allow
detection of a group at high risk of HCC emergence. Such analyses will clarify
how this malignancy can be treated, diagnosed and prevented more effectively.
