INTRODUCTION: Dengue virus infection is the most common arthropod-borne disease
worldwide with approximately 50 to 100 million cases of dengue infection
occurring annually. Globally, dengue incidence has increased in the last 40
years, especially in Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries where the
highest incidence is found. This systematic review aimed to present information
on dengue disease burden and use of health resources in the LAC region in the
last 15 years.
METHODS: We searched the main international and regional databases and generic
and academic Internet search engines. Gray literature was retrieved mainly from
regional health ministries and Pan American Health Organization. A set of
inclusion criteria was defined.
RESULTS: We identified 2,041 articles of which 25 met these criteria, 13 for
incidence and 12 for the use of resources and related costs. The pooled incidence
of classic dengue fever was 72.1 cases per 100,000 persons-years in the 44 LAC
countries analyzed (95% confidence interval 71.5-72.7), with an upward trend from
1995 up to 2010. Case-fatality ratio was highest in 1997 (0.12 [0.05-0.22]) and
lowest in 2009, and the overall mortality was 0.02 per 100,000 people. More than 
60% of the cases in the LAC region came from Brazil. The length of hospital stay 
ranged from 5 to 13 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Activities to control dengue transmission in the region have been
important but insufficient. The surveillance of dengue burden of disease and
circulating strains help shape and evaluate the present and future health
policies.
