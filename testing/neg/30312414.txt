Background: Vedolizumab (ENTYVIO) is a humanized α4β7 integrin antagonist
approved for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, which selectively
blocks gut-specific lymphocyte trafficking. We evaluated the risk of
opportunistic infections of interest in patients treated with vedolizumab.
Methods: We determined the frequency of opportunistic infections and tuberculosis
in patients receiving vedolizumab in phase 3 clinical trials and post-marketing
settings. We also evaluated adverse events reported in the post-marketing setting
in patients with a history of or concurrent hepatitis B/C virus infection.
Results: The incidence of opportunistic infections in patients receiving
vedolizumab was 0.7 (GEMINI 1 and 2 clinical trials) and 1.0 (long-term safety
study) per 100 patient-years, with 217 events reported in approximately 114,071
patient-years of exposure (post-marketing setting). Most opportunistic infections
were nonserious and the majority of patients continued treatment with
vedolizumab. Clostridium difficile was the most commonly reported infection, with
an incidence rate of 0.5 per 100 patient-years (clinical trials). Tuberculosis
was reported at 0.1 per 100 patient-years (clinical trials), with 7 events in the
post-marketing setting. No tuberculosis-related deaths were reported in either
setting. No cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy were reported. In
29 patients with a history of or concurrent hepatitis B/C infection in the
post-marketing setting, no viral reactivation was observed.
Conclusions: Clinical trials and post-marketing data showed that the rate of
serious opportunistic infections in patients receiving vedolizumab was low and
most patients could continue vedolizumab treatment. The frequency of tuberculosis
infection was also low and no hepatitis B/C viral reactivation was reported.
