Genetic analysis of transposon-induced mutations of the Rac prophage in
Escherichia coli K-12 which affect expression and function of recE.

Fourteen mitomycin-resistant revertants of a recB21 recC22 strain were isolated
after Tn5 mutagenesis. Eight of the mutations (type I) were essentially
inseparable from aphA+ (Kanr) of Tn5; six (type II) were not. We hypothesize that
the former are Tn5 and that the latter are IS50 insertions. Because of their
phenotypic similarity to sbcA and sbcB mutations, which also suppress recB21
recC22, we have called them sbc mutations. sbc-lll::Tn5 was cotransducible with
nirR and has thereby been located at position 29.8 on the Escherichia coli map in
the vicinity of the Rac prophage and sbcA mutations. A recB21 recC22 sbc-lll::Tn5
strain was subjected to Tn10 mutagenesis, and a mitomycin- and UV-sensitive
mutant was isolated. tet+ of Tn10 was 85% cotransducible with aphA+ of Tn5,
locating these two transposons 0.1 map unit apart. A three-point cross located
the Tn10 mutation at position 29.7. We hypothesize that the Tn10 insertion is
located in recE and that the Tn5 and IS50 insertions activate expression of this 
gene. sbc-lll::Tn5 was found to be cis acting and dominant to its wild-type
allele as were two sbcA mutations (sbcA1 and sbcA6). Five other type I and type
II insertion mutations were dominant to their wild-type alleles. We hypothesize
that the sbc insertion and sbcA mutations affect transcription regulation of recE
and discuss the possibility that they do so differently.
