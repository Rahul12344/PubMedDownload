A 14-year-old male drank two glasses of milk from a gallon inoculated with 21
vials of live virus vaccine intended to immunize 1000 baby chicks against
Newcastle Disease. The patient was managed with catharsis and careful
observation, and remained completely asymptomatic in the following 28 days.
Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) may cause paralytic neurotropic, viscerotropic, or 
pneumonotropic disease in chickens, but has limited effects on humans. Systemic
exposure to this vaccine has not previously been reported in humans, although an 
aerosol NDV vaccine has caused self-limited conjunctivitis following ocular
exposure. The human effects of veterinary biologicals remain poorly defined. The 
limited literature existing in regards to the human experience with common
veterinary vaccines is reviewed.
