Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is one of the major livestock disease problems in most
areas of Ethiopia. A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study was conducted from
October 2011 to February 2012 in four selected districts of Afar and Tigray
regions to estimate the herd-level prevalence of LSD, and to assess its
associated risk factors. Herd-owners were selected based on the willingness to
provide information to complete the questionnaire. A total of 393 questionnaires 
were collected. Out of 393 herd-owners, 173 reported having LSD in their herds,
giving an estimated herd- and animal-level prevalence of (44%, 95% CI: 37-50%)
and (7.4%, 95% CI: 6-8%), respectively. Herd prevalence between regions and among
the districts were significantly different (χ(2)=8, P<0.01 and χ(2)=9.9, P<0.01),
respectively. The risk factors of LSD occurrence were introduction of a new
animal to the herd, herd size, and utilization of communal grazing and watering
points. These management characteristics cannot be readily changed in the studied
area, hence, disease control should rely on a greater use of effective LSD
vaccines.
