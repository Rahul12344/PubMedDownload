OBJECTIVE: To review the short-term response and safety of protease inhibitor
therapy in HIV-infected children.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of open-label protease inhibitor-containing
combination therapy.
SETTING: Two urban pediatric HIV centers.
PATIENTS: Twenty-eight HIV-infected children were prescribed 30 protease
inhibitor-containing antiretroviral therapy combinations. The median age at
initiation of protease inhibitor antiretroviral therapy was 79 months. Patients
had been on previous antiretroviral therapy for a mean of 45.5 months.
RESULTS: Of the 28 children who completed at least 1 month of therapy, 26
experienced marked virologic and immunologic improvement (mean maximal decrease
in viral load 1.90 log10 copies/ml; SD, 0.8; mean maximal rise in CD4+
lymphocytes of 279 x 10(6)/l; SD, 300 x 10(6)/l). Eleven patients achieved a
viral nadir of < 400 copies/ml, and seven sustained this level of viral
suppression for a mean of 6 months. Indinavir use was associated with a high
incidence of renal side-effects, including two patients who developed
interstitial nephritis. Two patients on ritonavir experienced a significant
elevation of liver enzymes.
CONCLUSIONS: Protease inhibitor therapy was associated with substantial
short-term virologic and immunologic improvement in this primarily heavily
pretreated cohort, with 25% maintaining a viral load of < 400 copies/ml after 6
months of therapy. There was a significant rate of adverse events.
Pharmacokinetic and safety data are needed to guide aggressive antiretroviral
therapy in HIV-infected children, and further treatment options are required for 
those failing or intolerant to the available protease inhibitors.
