Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious
disease recently discovered in northeastern and central China that is caused by a
novel bunyavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV).
Humans are primarily infected through tick bites. Four previous reports have
discussed SFTS infection from person to person, all cases of which were
symptomatic. In this report, we analysed the epidemiological and clinical data
for a cluster of cases, including one case of secondary-asymptomatic infection,
and review the literature regarding SFTSV transmission from person to person. We 
conclude that SFTSV caused the asymptomatic infections via person-to-person
contact with infected blood.
