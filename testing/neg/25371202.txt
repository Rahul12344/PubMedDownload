Entry of HIV-1 into host cells remains a compelling yet elusive target for
developing agents to prevent infection. A peptide triazole (PT) class of entry
inhibitor has previously been shown to bind to HIV-1 gp120, suppress interactions
of the Env protein at host cell receptor binding sites, inhibit cell infection,
and cause envelope spike protein breakdown, including gp120 shedding and, for
some variants, virus membrane lysis. We found that gold nanoparticle-conjugated
forms of peptide triazoles (AuNP-PT) exhibit substantially more potent antiviral 
effects against HIV-1 than corresponding peptide triazoles alone. Here, we sought
to reveal the mechanism of potency enhancement underlying nanoparticle conjugate 
function. We found that altering the physical properties of the nanoparticle
conjugate, by increasing the AuNP diameter and/or the density of PT conjugated on
the AuNP surface, enhanced potency of infection inhibition to impressive
picomolar levels. Further, compared with unconjugated PT, AuNP-PT was less
susceptible to reduction of antiviral potency when the density of PT-competent
Env spikes on the virus was reduced by incorporating a peptide-resistant mutant
gp120. We conclude that potency enhancement of virolytic activity and
corresponding irreversible HIV-1 inactivation of PTs upon AuNP conjugation
derives from multivalent contact between the nanoconjugates and metastable Env
spikes on the HIV-1 virus. The findings reveal that multispike engagement can
exploit the metastability built into virus the envelope to irreversibly
inactivate HIV-1 and provide a conceptual platform to design nanoparticle-based
antiviral agents for HIV-1 specifically and putatively for metastable enveloped
viruses generally.
