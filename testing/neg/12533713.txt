The genomic sequence of a new icosahedral DNA virus infecting Myzus persicae has 
been determined. Analysis of 5499 nt of the viral genome revealed five open
reading frames (ORFs) evenly distributed in the 5' half of both DNA strands.
Three ORFs (ORF1-3) share the same strand, while two other ORFs (ORF4 and ORF5)
are detected in the complementary sequence. The overall genomic organization is
similar to that of species from the genus DENSOVIRUS: ORFs 1-3 most likely encode
the non-structural proteins, since their putative products contain conserved
replication motifs, NTP-binding domains and helicase domains similar to those
found in the NS-1 protein of parvoviruses. The deduced amino acid sequences from 
ORFs 4 and 5 show sequence similarities with the structural proteins of the
members of the genus DENSOVIRUS: These data indicate that this virus is a new
species of the genus Densovirus in the family PARVOVIRIDAE: The virus was
tentatively named Myzus persicae densovirus.
