The aim of this study was to assess the role of cytology, human papilloma virus
(HPV) DNA and human papilloma virus messenger RNA (HPV mRNA) assays in detecting 
cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+ (CNi 2+) (recurrences/persistence)
during the follow-up of women after treatment of cervical intraepithelial lesion.
This cross-sectional study was performed among 43 women treated for cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) between January 2014 and January 2017 at the
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Spedali Civili's Hospital, Brescia,
Italy. Pap smear and cervical samples for HPV tests were collected during the
follow-up visit. Furthermore, colposcopy was always performed in order to find
out the persistence/recurrence of the disease. A cervical biopsy was collected
when necessary. Cervical samples obtained were tested for HPV DNA using the
INNO-LiPa HPV assay and for HPV mRNA using the APTIMA assay. The mean age of
enrolled women was 42.5 years. Among the treated patients, more than 50% of women
revealed the absence of high risk HPV DNA and HPV mRNA. We found the persistence 
of the disease cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN 2) only in one
woman. The sensitivity of cytology, HPV DNA and HPV mRNA in detecting disease was
satisfactory (100%), while the specificity was quite different for the three
tests: 64.2, 52.4 and 78.9%, respectively. The HPV mRNA test has higher
specificity with respect to cytology and HPV DNA, avoiding the referral to
unnecessary colposcopy with an improvement of costs/benefits for healthcare
system. However, given the small size sample, this study should be considered as 
a pilot for future larger studies.
