Following an extensive epidemic of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in 1981, a
serological survey was carried out in the South Arcot district of Tamil Nadu in
April 1982. Serum specimens were obtained from 10 villages with serologically
proven infections and 6 villages with no reported case of encephalitis during the
1981 epidemic. The serum specimens tested for haemagglutination inhibition,
complement fixing and neutralizing antibodies, showed a high prevalence of JE
(49.17%), West Nile (40.78%) and dengue (18.14%) viruses with predominance of JE.
The prevalence did not differ between the villages with or without Japanese
encephalities. There was also no difference between the family members and
neighbours.
