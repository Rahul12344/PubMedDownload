In August 1997, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) convened an expert working group to discuss
current strategies for the development of HIV type 1 vaccines. Based on the
recent findings of investigators from Japan's National Institute of Infectious
Diseases (NIID) in Tokyo using recombinant bacillus Calmette-Guérin (rBCG) as a
potential vectored vaccine for HIV, a recommendation was made that further work
in this area is a priority. As a result, the working group reconvened in
September 1998 to discuss the progress to date with this vaccine approach, as
well as areas of related research to assess the feasibility of a BCG-vectored HIV
vaccine. This report summarizes the discussions addressing the available
scientific data on the potential use of rBCG as a vector for preventive HIV
vaccines, the work necessary to move such candidate vaccines into Phase 1
clinical trials, and recommendations targeted at facilitating the long-term
development of rBCG-vectored HIV vaccines.
