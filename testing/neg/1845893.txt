The maturation of the poliovirus capsid occurs as the result of a single
unexplained proteolytic event during which 58 to 59 copies of the 60 VP0 capsid
protein precursors are cleaved. An autocatalytic mechanism for cleavage of VP0 to
VP4 and VP2 was proposed by Arnold et al. (E. Arnold, M. Luo, G. Vriend, M. G.
Rossman, A. C. Palmenberg, G. D. Parks, M. J. Nicklin, and E. Wimmer, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 84:21-25, 1987) in which serine 10 of VP2 is activated by virion
RNA to catalyze VP4-VP2 processing. The hypothesis rests on the observation that 
a hydrogen bond was observed between serine 10 of VP2 (S2010) and the carboxyl
terminus of VP4 in three mature picornaviral atomic structures: rhinovirus 14,
mengovirus, and poliovirus type 1 (Mahoney). We constructed mutant viruses with
cysteine (S2010C) or alanine (S2010A) replacing serine 10 of VP2; these exhibited
normal proteolytic processing of VP0. While our results do not exclude an
autocatalytic mechanism for the maturation cleavage, they do eliminate the
conserved S2010 residue as the catalytic amino acid.
