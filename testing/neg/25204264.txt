BACKGROUND: Triple therapy with pegylated interferon, ribavirin and a protease
inhibitor has proven efficacy in hepatitis C infection and is currently the
standard of care. Interferon-based therapies have been, rarely, associated with
the development of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, but few cases have yet been reported
in triple therapy for hepatitis C.
CASE REPORT: We describe a case of autoimmune Type 1 diabetes developing in a
23-year-old woman after initiation of triple therapy for chronic hepatitis C
virus infection. The patient had the IL-28B gene polymorphism rs12979860 CT
genotype, which is associated not only with antiviral therapy response but also
with diabetes risk after liver transplantation for hepatitis C.
CONCLUSION: Further studies are required to determine which individual
characteristics may identify patients who are at risk of developing Type 1
diabetes when treated with interferon-based regimens for hepatitis C infection.
