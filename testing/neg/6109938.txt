children. Controlled trial in an endemic area (Senegal).

Maupas P, Chiron JP, Barin F, Coursaget P, Goudeau A, Perrin J, Denis F, Mar ID.

Three doses of inactivated hepatitis B vaccine were given at one-month intervals 
to Senegalese children aged less than two years. A control group received
diphtheria/tetanus/polio vaccine. Of those HB vaccine recipients who were
seronegative before immunisation, 94.5% had a specific anti-HBs response.
Anti-HBs of maternal origin did not interfere with the active immunisation. HB
vaccine was without ill-effects, irrespective of hepatitis B marker status before
immunisation. After twelve months' follow-up, the incidence of the HBsAg carrier 
state was reduced by 85% in susceptible children (p less than 0.0001).
