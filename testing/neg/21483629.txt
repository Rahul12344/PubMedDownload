AIM: To determine the effect of Legalon-SIL (LS) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) core 
and NS5A expression and on heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) and its transcriptional
regulators in human hepatoma cells expressing full length HCV genotype 1b.
METHODS: CON1 cells were treated with 50 μmol/L or 200 μmol/L LS. Cells were
harvested after 2, 6 and 24 h. HCV RNA and protein levels were determined by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting,
respectively.
RESULTS: HCV RNA (core and NS5A regions) was decreased after 6 h with LS 200
μmol/L (P < 0.05). Both 50 and 200 μmol/L LS decreased HCV RNA levels [core
region (by 55% and 88%, respectively) and NS5A region (by 62% and 87%,
respectively) after 24 h compared with vehicle (dimethyl sulphoxide) control (P <
0.01). Similarly HCV core and NS5A protein were decreased (by 85%, P < 0.01 and
by 65%, P < 0.05, respectively) by LS 200 μmol/L. Bach1 and HMOX-1 RNA were also 
downregulated by LS treatment (P < 0.01), while Nrf2 protein was increased (P <
0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that treatment with LS downregulates HCV core
and NS5A expression in CON1 cells which express full length HCV genotype 1b, and 
suggests that LS may prove to be a valuable alternative or adjunctive therapy for
the treatment of HCV infection.
