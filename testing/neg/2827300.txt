Cervical HPV infection may be diagnosed by colposcopy, cytology, histology and
DNA hybridization. Each of these techniques alone may result in the detection of 
no more than 70% of the cases which are found by combining all methods. Typical
cytological and histological findings are illustrated. A morphological continuum 
exists between HPV associated epithelial atypias (VAE), dysplasias and
carcinomata in situ. The higher the grade of dysplasia, the lower the rate of
cytological VAE. HPV types 16/18 are more frequently found in severe rather than 
in mild dysplasias. The use of hybridization techniques in mass screening
programs appears premature, since the natural history of the infection is
unknown. Microscopic grading of epithelial dysplasia remains the basis for
patient care.
