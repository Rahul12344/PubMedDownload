Although the regulatory function of miRNAs and their targets have been
characterized in model plants, a possible underlying role in the cotton response 
to herbivore infestation has not been determined. To investigate this, we
performed small RNA and degradome sequencing between resistant and susceptible
cotton cultivar following infestation with the generalist herbivore whitefly. In 
total, the 260 miRNA families and 241 targets were identified. Quantitative-PCR
analysis revealed that several miRNAs and their corresponding targets exhibited
dynamic spatio-temporal expression patterns. Moreover, 17 miRNA precursors were
generated from 29 long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) transcripts. The
genome-wide analysis also led to the identification of 85 phased small
interfering RNA (phasiRNA) loci. Among these, nine PHAS genes were triggered by
miR167, miR390, miR482a, and two novel miRNAs, including those encoding a
leucine-rich repeat (LRR) disease resistance protein, an auxin response factor
(ARF) and MYB transcription factors. Through combined modeling and experimental
data, we explored and expanded the miR390-tasiARF cascade during the cotton
response to whitefly. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of ARF8 from miR390
target in whitefly-resistant cotton plants increased auxin and jasmonic acid (JA)
accumulation, resulting in increased tolerance to whitefly infestation. These
results highlight the provides a useful transcriptomic resource for
plant-herbivore interaction.
