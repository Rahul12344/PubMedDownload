Nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones of the murine myb proto-oncogene.

Gonda TJ, Gough NM, Dunn AR, de Blaquiere J.

We have isolated cDNA clones of murine c-myb mRNA which contain approximately 2.8
kb of the 3.9-kb mRNA sequence. Nucleotide sequencing has shown that these clones
extend both 5' and 3' to sequences homologous to the v-myb oncogenes of avian
myeloblastosis virus and avian leukemia virus E26. The sequence contains an open 
reading frame of 1944 nucleotides, and could encode a protein which is both
highly homologous, and of similar size (71 kd), to the chicken c-myb protein.
Examination of the deduced amino acid sequence of the murine c-myb protein
revealed the presence of a 3-fold tandem repeat of 52 residues near the N
terminus of the protein, and has enabled prediction of some of the likely
structural features of the protein. These include a high alpha-helix content, a
basic region toward the N terminus of the protein and an overall globular
configuration. The arrangement of genomic c-myb sequences, detected using the
cDNA clones as probes, was compared with the reported structure of rearranged
c-myb in certain tumour cells. This comparison suggested that the rearranged
c-myb gene may encode a protein which, like the v-myb protein, lacks the
N-terminal region of c-myb.
