PTPN4, a human tyrosine phosphatase, protects cells against apoptosis. This
protection could be abrogated by targeting the PDZ domain of this phosphatase
with a peptide mimicking the C-terminal sequence of the G protein of an
attenuated rabies virus strain. Here, we demonstrate that glioblastoma death is
triggered upon intracellular delivery of peptides, either from viral origin or
from known endogenous ligands of PTPN4-PDZ, such as the C terminus sequence of
the glutamate receptor subunit GluN2A. The killing efficiency of peptides closely
reflects their affinities for the PTPN4-PDZ. The crystal structures of two
PTPN4-PDZ/peptide complexes allow us to pinpoint the main structural determinants
of binding and to synthesize a peptide of high affinity for PTPN4-PDZ enhancing
markedly its cell death capacity. These results allow us to propose a potential
mechanism for the efficiency of peptides and provide a target and a robust
framework for the design of new pro-death compounds.
