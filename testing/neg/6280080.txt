Diagnosis of bovine leukosis virus infection by solid phase radioimmunoassay for 
virus antibody.

Zajac V, Altaner C.

Solid phase radioimmunoassay for detection of anti-BLV antibodies in sera of
infected animals is described. Viral antigens bound to surface of polystyrene are
able selectively adsorb the antibodies from serum. Detection of bound antibodies 
quantitatively was done by 125I-labeled protein A from Staphylococcus aureus.
Technical details of the assay are reported. The assay could be used as
competitive one as well. Two different methods for detection of anti-BLV
antibodies were compared with solid phase RIA. The solid phase RIA is highly
sensitive, specific and available for large-scale examination. The assay is
recommended for early diagnosis of bovine leukosis.
