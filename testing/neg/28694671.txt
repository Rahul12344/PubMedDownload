AIM: To evaluate if any association existed between the extent of hepatic
necrosis in initial liver biopsies and patient survival.
METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with fulminant liver failure, whose liver biopsy
exhibited substantial necrosis, were identified and included in the study. The
histological and clinical data was then analyzed in order to assess the
relationship between the extent of necrosis and patient survival, with and
without liver transplantation. The patients were grouped based on the etiology of
hepatic necrosis. Each of the etiology groups were then further stratified
according to whether or not they had received a liver transplant post-index
biopsy, and whether or not the patient survived.
RESULTS: The core tissue length ranged from 5 to 44 mm with an average of 23 mm. 
Causes of necrosis included 14 autoimmune hepatitis, 10 drug induced liver injury
(DILI), 9 hepatitis virus infection, and 4 unknown origin. Among them, 11 showed 
submassive (26%-75% of the parenchymal volume) and 26 massive (76%-100%)
necrosis. Transplant-free survival was worse in patients with a higher extent of 
necrosis (40%, 71.4% and 100% in groups with necrosis of 76%-100%, 51%-75% and
26%-50%, respectively). Additionally, transplant-free survival rates were 66.7%, 
57.1%, and 25.0% in groups of autoimmune hepatitis, DILI, and viral hepatitis,
respectively. Even after liver transplantation, the survival rate in patients as 
a result of viral hepatitis remained the lowest (80%, 100%, and 40% in groups of 
autoimmune hepatitis, DILI, and viral hepatitis, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Adequate liver biopsy with more than 75% necrosis is associated with 
significant transplant-free mortality that is critical in predicting survival.
