DNA samples from cancer tissues diagnosed histologically as squamous cell
carcinoma of the uterine cervix were examined for the presence of human
papillomavirus (HPV) genome DNA by Southern blot hybridization. Of 63 specimens, 
32 were found to hybridize with HPV DNA probes; 23 specimens (35%) with HPV type 
16 (HPV16), one (2%) with HPV type 18 (HPV18), four (7%) with HPV type 52b
(HPV52b), and four others (7%) weakly with HPV52b. Specimens negative for HPV DNA
with Southern blot hybridization were subjected to polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to determine the presence of HPV DNA under more sensitive conditions. After
PCR using one set of primers specific for HPV16 and HPV52b, 7 out of 31 specimens
were found to have HPV16 DNA. None was positive for HPV52b DNA. Our results
indicate that HPV52b, as well as HPV16 and HPV18, is associated with squamous
cell carcinoma of uterine cervix, and more sensitive determination of HPV
infection can be made by amplification of the viral genome by PCR.
