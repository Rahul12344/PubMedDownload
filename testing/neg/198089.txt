Intranuclear tubular structures observed in the cells of an alveolar cell
carcinoma of the lung.

Torikata C, Ishiwata K.

Intranuclear tubular structures observed in the cells of an alveolar cell
carcinoma of the lung are described. The structures were composed of membraneous 
tubules, measured about 60 nm in diameter, and had an electron-dense central
core. These unusual structures were seen in the nuclei of neoplastic cells (Type 
II pneumocytes). The nature of the tubular structures remains unsolved, but
morphologic characteristics and associated grnaulomatous reaction in the stroma
imply the possibility of an unknown virus-like infection.
