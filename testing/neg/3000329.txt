Hematoporphyrin derivative therapy of papillomas. Experimental study.

Shikowitz MJ, Steinberg BM, Abramson AL.

Hematoporphyrin derivative has been shown to selectively localize in malignant
tissues and chemically induced animal papillomas. It is a powerful
photo-sensitizing agent that can cause destruction and death of tissues in which 
it has localized by the generation of singlet oxygen when activated by light of
the appropriate wavelength (photodynamic therapy [PDT]). Laryngeal papillomas are
rapidly growing benign epithelial neoplasms with a clinical course marked by
multiple recurrences after surgical removal. Before considering PDT as a
therapeutic modality in the treatment of this debilitating disease we developed
an animal model for experimentation. Using the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, 
sometimes referred to as the Shope papillomavirus, large cutaneous papillomas
were induced on the backs of Dutch Belted rabbits. Following intravenous
administration of hematoporphyrin derivative, PDT was delivered with white light.
Marked regression of the papillomas was noted with replacement by normal
hair-bearing skin. The clinical implications of this work to the control of
laryngeal papillomatosis is discussed.
