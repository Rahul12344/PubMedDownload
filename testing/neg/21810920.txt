The application of phage display technology to mammalian proteins with multiple
transmembrane regions has had limited success due to the difficulty in generating
these proteins in sufficient amounts and purity. We report here a method that can
be easily and generally applied to sorting of phage display libraries with
multispan protein targets solubilized in detergent. A key feature of this
approach is the production of biotinylated multispan proteins in virions of a
baculovirus vector that allows library panning without prior purification of the 
target protein. We obtained Fab fragments from a naïve synthetic antibody phage
library that, when engineered into full-length immunoglobulin (Ig)G, specifically
bind cells expressing claudin-1, a protein with four transmembrane regions that
is used as an entry co-receptor by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Affinity-matured 
variants of one of these antibodies efficiently inhibited HCV infection. The use 
of baculovirus particles as a source of mammalian multispan protein facilitates
the application of phage display to this difficult class of proteins.
