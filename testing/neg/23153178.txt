BACKGROUND: Arthropod-borne viral infections cause several emerging and resurging
infectious diseases. Among the diseases caused by arboviruses, chikungunya is
responsible for a high level of severe human disease worldwide. The salivary
glands of mosquitoes are the last barrier before pathogen transmission.
METHODS: We undertook a proteomic approach to characterize the key virus/vector
interactions and host protein modifications that occur in the salivary glands
that could be responsible for viral transmission by using quantitative
two-dimensional electrophoresis.
RESULTS: We defined the protein modulations in the salivary glands of Aedes
aegypti that were triggered 3 and 5 days after an oral infection (3 and 5 DPI)
with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Gel profile comparisons showed that CHIKV at 3
DPI modulated the level of 13 proteins, and at 5 DPI 20 proteins. The amount of
10 putatively secreted proteins was regulated at both time points. These proteins
were implicated in blood-feeding or in immunity, but many have no known function.
CHIKV also modulated the quantity of proteins involved in several metabolic
pathways and in cell signalling.
CONCLUSION: Our study constitutes the first analysis of the protein response of
Aedes aegypti salivary glands infected with CHIKV. We found that the
differentially regulated proteins in response to viral infection include
structural proteins and enzymes for several metabolic pathways. Some may favour
virus survival, replication and transmission, suggesting a subversion of the
insect cell metabolism by arboviruses. For example, proteins involved in
blood-feeding such as the short D7, an adenosine deaminase and inosine-uridine
preferring nucleoside hydrolase, may favour virus transmission by exerting an
increased anti-inflammatory effect. This would allow the vector to bite without
the bite being detected. Other proteins, like the anti-freeze protein, may
support vector protection.
