Poxviruses encode up to four different soluble TNF receptors, named cytokine
response modifier B (CrmB), CrmC, CrmD and CrmE. These proteins mimic the
extracellular domain of the cellular TNF receptors to bind and inhibit the
activity of TNF and, in some cases, other TNF superfamily ligands. Most of these 
ligands are released after the enzymic cleavage of a membrane precursor. However,
transmembrane TNF (tmTNF) is not only a precursor of soluble TNF but also exerts 
specific pro-inflammatory and immunological activities. Here, we report that
viral TNF receptors bound and inhibited tmTNF and describe some interesting
differences in their activity against the soluble cytokine. Thus, CrmE, which
does not inhibit mouse soluble TNF, could block murine tmTNF-induced
cytotoxicity. We propose that this anti-tmTNF effect should be taken into
consideration when assessing the role of viral TNF decoy receptors in the
pathogenesis of poxvirus.
