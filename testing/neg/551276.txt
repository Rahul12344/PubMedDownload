Two-step binding of eukaryotic ribosomes to brome mosaic virus RNA3.

Ahlquist P, Dasgupta R, Shih DS, Zimmern D, Kaesberg P.

Although brome mosaic virus RNA3 has only one translatable cistron, it can bind
two 80S ribosomes at initiation. One ribosome binds at the first AUG codon (base 
92-94). The other binds nearer the 5' end at an entry or holding site. Disome
formation is thus unrelated to a silent cistron approximately 1,000 bases
downstream.
