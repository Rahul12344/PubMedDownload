Recombinant adenoviruses, poxviruses, and plasmid DNA vaccines encoding different
hepatitis B virus (HBV)/murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein chimeras were used 
to immunize mice. Processing of the chimeras resulted in presentation of a
protective Ld/CD8+ T-cell epitope of the immediate early 1 protein pp89 (IE1
pp89) of MCMV to the immune system. Different levels of immunogenicity were
observed depending on: (i) the type of viral vector used, (ii) whether the
antigens were included in the cellular secretion pathway, and (iii) the location 
of the protective epitope within the chimeric protein. An adenovirus expressing a
secretory HBV core protein with the MCMV epitope in its C-terminus induced the
highest immune response. When the most immunogenic adenovirus and vaccinia virus 
were used in a heterologous prime-boost immunization protocol, even higher levels
of epitope-specific T cells were obtained. Furthermore, responses were protective
against a challenge with MCMV, inducing up to a 96% reduction of viral load in
immunized animals, as determined by a sensitive real-time PCR assay. Together,
these results confirmed previous observations of the efficient use of adenoviral 
and poxviral vectors in prime-boost protocols for immunization against diseases
whose resolution depends on cellular immunity, as well as the aptness of
correctly designed chimeric carrier proteins to facilitate this goal.
