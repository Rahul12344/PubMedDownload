A multiplex real-time PCR was developed using a single pair of primers and
fluorescent probes specific for five malignant catarrhal fever viruses and an
internal positive control. The assay was able to simultaneously detect and
differentiate the viruses in clinical samples with high sensitivity (97.2%) and
specificity (100%).
