corresponding pseudorevertant isolated without imposed selection.

Ribose-binding protein is exported to the periplasmic compartment of Escherichia 
coli by a process that involves proteolytic cleavage of an amino-terminal
extension of amino acids from the precursor form of the protein. In a collection 
of mutants isolated as defective in the Rbs transport system, a strain was
identified that contained only precursor ribose-binding protein, none of which
was exported to its normal location in the periplasm. The mutated rbsB contained 
a base substitution that results in a change of leucine to a proline at
position-17 in the signal sequence. A pseudorevertant of the mutant contained
proteolytically processed, active ribose-binding protein in the periplasm. The
pseudorevertant rbsB carried a second mutation: serine at position-15 in the
signal sequence was changed to phenylalanine. Isolation of a signal sequence
mutant and a corresponding pseudorevertant without specific selection or
site-directed mutagenesis emphasizes the possibility of obtaining export mutants 
without the use of procedures that could bias or limit the range of mutations
found. Explanation of the extreme phenotype of the mutant and the effective
correction of that phenotype in the pseudorevertant requires extension of current
notions of critical features of signal sequences.
