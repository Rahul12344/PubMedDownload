BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is the most common opportunistic infection among people 
infected with human immunodeficiency virus and its first cause of morbidity and
mortality.
OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics of a population in Israel with both
tuberculosis disease and HIV infection in order to identify factors that
contribute to outcome.
METHODS: The study group comprised patients hospitalized in the Pulmonary and
Tuberculosis Department of Shmuel Harofeh Hospital during the period January 2000
to December 2006. They were located by a computer search of the hospital registry
and the pertinent data were collected.
RESULTS: During the study period 1059 cases of active tuberculosis disease were
hospitalized; 93 of them were co-infected with HIV. Most of them came from
endemic countries (61.2% from Ethiopia and 20.4% from the former Soviet Union;
none of them was born in Israel). Ten percent of the cases were multiple-drug
resistant and 32% showed extrapulmonary involvement. The response rate to the
treatment was good, and the median hospitalization time was 70 days. The
mortality rate was 3.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of pulmonary disease in our group, the
short-term outcome was good and the Mycobacterium was highly sensitive to
first-line drugs. These encouraging results can be attributed to the fact that
tuberculosis patients in Israel are identified early and treated continuously and
strictly, with early initiation of antiretroviral therapy, which together ensure 
that the development of drug resistance is low.
