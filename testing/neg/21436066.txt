Viral persistence during chronic viral infections is associated with a
progressive loss of T-cell effector function called functional exhaustion. There 
is therefore a need to develop immunotherapies to remediate the functional
deficits of T cells during these infections. We investigated the
immunotherapeutic effects of IL-7 during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis
virus infection in mice. Our results showed that the effects of IL-7 on T cells
depend on the viral load, timing, and duration of treatment during the course of 
the infection. We document that the effectiveness of IL-7 was constrained by high
viral load early in the infection, but treatment for at least 3 weeks during
declining viral titers mitigated the programmed contraction of CD8 T cells,
markedly enhanced the number of high-quality polyfunctional virus-specific CD8 T 
cells with a nonexhausted phenotype, and accelerated viral control.
Mechanistically, the enhancement of CD8 T-cell responses by IL-7 was associated
with increased proliferation and induction of Bcl-2, but not with altered levels 
of PD-1 or Cbl-b. In summary, our results strongly suggest that IL-7 therapy is a
potential strategy to bolster the quality and quantity of T-cell responses in
patients with chronic viral infections.
