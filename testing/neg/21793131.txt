Over a century since its development, the analytical technique of mass
spectrometry is blooming more than ever, and applied in nearly all aspects of the
natural and life sciences. In the last two decades mass spectrometry has also
become amenable to the analysis of proteins and even intact protein complexes,
and thus begun to make a significant impact in the field of structural biology.
In this Review, we describe the emerging role of mass spectrometry, with its
different technical facets, in structural biology, focusing especially on
structural virology. We describe how mass spectrometry has evolved into a tool
that can provide unique structural and functional information about viral-protein
and protein-complex structure, conformation, assembly, and topology, extending to
the direct analysis of intact virus capsids of several million Dalton in mass.
Mass spectrometry is now used to address important questions in virology ranging 
from how viruses assemble to how they interact with their host.
