Susceptibility of specific pathogen-free lambs to concentrations of Pasteurella
haemolytica serotype A2 in aerosols.

Gilmour NJ, Donachie W, Fraser J, Quirie M.

A 100-fold reduction in the numbers of organisms in an aerosol of Pasteurella
haemolytica used to infect specific pathogen-free lambs did not alter the number 
of cases of pneumonia which resulted. In a separate experiment a further 10-fold 
reduction in the number of organisms in the aerosol did not cause fewer cases of 
pneumonia.
