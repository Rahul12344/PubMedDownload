Before antibiotics, sera from immune animals and humans were used to treat a
variety of infectious diseases, often with successful results. After the
discovery of antimicrobial agents, serum therapy for bacterial infections was
rapidly forsaken. In the last two decades, problems with treatment of newly
emerged, re-emerged, or persistent infectious diseases necessitated researchers
to develop new and/or improved antibody-based therapeutic approaches. This
article reviews some information on the use of antibodies for the treatment of
infectious diseases, with special reference to the most seminal discoveries and
current advances as well as available treatment approaches in this field.
