We evaluated the anti-influenza-virus effects of Melia components and discuss the
utility of these components. The effects of leaf components of Melia azedarach L.
on viruses were examined, and plaque inhibition tests were performed. The in vivo
efficacy of M. azedarach L. was tested in a mouse model. Leaf components of Melia
azedarach L. markedly inhibited the growth of various influenza viruses. In an
initial screening, multiplication and haemagglutination (HA) activities of H1N1, 
H3N2, H5, and B influenza viruses were inactivated by the liquid extract of
leaves of M. azedarach L. (MLE). Furthermore, plaque inhibition titres of H1N1,
H3N2, and B influenza viruses treated with MLE ranged from 103.7 to 104.2. MLE
possessed high plaque-inhibitory activity against pandemic avian H5N1, H7N9, and 
H9N2 vaccine candidate strains, with a plaque inhibition titre of more than
104.2. Notably, the buoyant density decreased from 1.175 to 1.137Â g/cm3, and
spikeless particles appeared. We identified four anti-influenza virus substances:
pheophorbide b, pheophorbide a, pyropheophorbide a, and pheophytin a.
Photomorphogenesis inside the envelope may lead to removal of HA and
neuraminidase spikes from viruses. Thus, MLE could efficiently remove floating
influenza virus in the air space without toxicity. Consistent with this finding, 
intranasal administration of MLE in mice significantly decreased the occurrence
of pneumonia. Additionally, leaf powder of Melia (MLP) inactivated influenza
viruses and viruses in the intestines of chickens. MLE and MLP may have
applications as novel, safe biological disinfectants for use in humans and
poultry.
