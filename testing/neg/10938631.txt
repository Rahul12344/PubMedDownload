Restriction-modification (RM) systems are cognate gene complexes that code for an
endonuclease and a methylase. They are often thought to have developed in
bacteria as protection against invading genetic material, e.g., phage DNA. The
high diversity of RM systems, as observed in nature, is often ascribed to the
coevolution of RM systems (which 'invent' novel types) and phages. However, the
extent to which phages are insensitive to RM systems casts doubts on the
effectiveness of RM systems as protection against infection and thereby on the
reason for the diversity of RM systems. We present an eco-evolutionary model in
order to study the evolution of the diversity of RM systems. The model predicts
that in general diversity of RM systems is high. More importantly, the diversity 
of the RM systems is expressed either at the individual level or at the
population level. In the first case all individuals carry RM systems of all
sequence specificities, whereas in the second case they carry only one RM system 
or no RM systems at all. Nevertheless, in the second case the same number of
sequence specificities are present in the population.
