Reported in Brazil since the 1930's, citrus leprosis, caused mainly by citrus
leprosis virus C, has been a major concern for the national sweet orange
production. In recent years, the disease has spread to several other countries
and it is now considered a worldwide threat. The occurrence of the disease has
been studied almost exclusively in sweet oranges because other citrus genotypes
are of secondary relevance in Brazil and in some other American countries where
it occurs. Here we report 12 resistant citrus genotypes among 160 accessions
evaluated. After 90 days of the infestation with viruliferous mites, asymptomatic
genotypes were observed in sour orange, lemon, grapefruit, mandarins, tangelo,
and tangor groups. The results revealed promising genotypes resistant to the
disease, which can be incorporated in citrus breeding programs aiming to obtain
varietal resistance, and confirmed the susceptibility of many citrus genotypes to
CiLV-C. This assay ratify the already reported uneven level of susceptibility
within the citrus group.
