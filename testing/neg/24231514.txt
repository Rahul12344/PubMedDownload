BACKGROUND AIMS: Recombinant adenoviruses have tremendous potential in both gene 
therapy research and therapeutic applications. Mesenchymal stromal cells have a
set of several properties that make them ideally suited for both regenerative
medicine and gene and drug delivery. A limitation of adenoviral-mediated gene
transfer is indeed the poor transduction rate of cells with low or no levels of
the specific adenoviral cell surface receptor coxsackie virus and adenovirus
receptor (CAR), such as human mesenchymal stromal cells. In the present work, we 
tried to increase the adenovirus transduction level and mediated gene delivery of
human adipose stem cells with the use of valproic acid (VPA) and determined the
proper concentration and duration of treatment alone or in combination with
ViraDuctin adenovirus transduction reagent.
METHODS: Green fluorescent protein-expressing recombinant adenovirus was
propagated. The effects of various doses and exposure periods of VPA on CAR
expression in human adipose stem cells were speculated by quantitative real-time 
polymerase chain reaction and adenoviral transduction rate by flow cytometry in
different doses and time intervals of VPA and in combination with ViraDuctin
transduction reagent.
RESULTS: CAR messenger RNA upregulation through VPA was observed in human adipose
stem cells; it was a dependent factor of dose and exposure time. Consequently,
adenoviral transduction level of human adipose stem cells treated with VPA was
increased, and co-administration of VPA and ViraDuctin further enhanced the
transduction rate.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that addition of VPA to hASCs alone or in
combination with ViraDuctin has enhancing effects on adenoviral transduction
rate, which can be auspicious in adenoviral-mediated gene therapy.
