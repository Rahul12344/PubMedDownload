Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)
glycoprotein 60 (gp60) and gp 17/18 (F3132 and 5H6 respectively) were found to
react with the same protein, which was identified as a homologue of herpes
simplex virus type 1 gD. MAb F3132 strongly neutralized virus infectivity and
inhibited the penetration of the virus into the cell. The effects on penetration 
were shared with three other MAbs against this protein (P68, F3116 and F3129),
but no effect on virus penetration was found with any other anti-EHV-1 MAb
tested. The level of glycosylation of gp60 was analysed using glycanase enzymes
and glycosylation inhibitors, and consisted of mainly N-linked carbohydrate. The 
M(r) of non-N-glycosylated gp60 was 50K.
