by continuous intravenous infusion.

Sixteen immunocompromised patients with herpes virus infections were treated for 
three to five days with continuously administered intravenous acyclovir. Patients
received initial acyclovir infusions over 5 minutes in dosages ranging from 1.5
to 5.0 mg/kg followed by continuously infused acyclovir at 7.2, 14.4, 21.6, 28.8,
36.0, or 43.2 mg/kg per day. The mean serum plateau levels of acyclovir
determined by radioimmunoassay ranged from 4.1 microM for the 7.2 mg/kg per day
dosage to 36.6 microM for the 43.2 mg/kg per day dose. A mean of 75 percent of
acyclovir administered was recovered in the urine of patients treated. Eleven of 
13 patients with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections had no new vesicle
formation after three days of acyclovir treatment and all patients ceased to have
new vesicles after five days of therapy. For the nine patients from whom complete
viral cultures were available, six ceased to shed virus at three days, and viral 
shedding ceased by five days in all patients treated with acyclovir. No clinical 
or laboratory adverse reactions were associated with acyclovir therapy. These
data suggest that acyclovir given by continuous intravenous infusion may be
useful in the treatment of herpes virus infections in immunocompromised patients.
