With the incidence and mortality rates of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea,
Liberia and Sierra Leone now at zero and reports of the largest and most complex 
EVD outbreak in history no longer on the front pages of newspapers worldwide, the
urgency of that crisis seems to have subsided. During this lull after the storm
and before the next one, the international community needs to engage in a
'lessons-learned' exercise with respect to our collective scientific, clinical
and public health preparedness. This engagement must identify pragmatic,
innovative mechanisms at multinational, national and community levels that allow 
research and development of next generation diagnostics and therapeutics, the
safe and effective practice of medicine, and the maintenance of public health to 
keep pace with the rapid epidemiological dynamics of EVD and other deadly
infectious diseases.
