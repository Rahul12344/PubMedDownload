Because the time from primary infection to symptoms in human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is typically 8-10 years, the use of surrogate
markers to monitor disease progression and therapeutic efficacy is of interest.
An acid dissociation procedure that disrupts the p24 antigen-antibody complexes
found in early HIV-1 infection has greatly increased the sensitivity of p24
detection assays. The utility of p24 antigen after acid treatment as a surrogate 
marker of disease progression and therapeutic effect in asymptomatic HIV-infected
subjects receiving zidovudine (AZT) was determined. After acid treatment, the
sensitivity of p24 antigen detection increased fivefold. The proportion of
subjects who were antigenemic increased over the 48-week follow-up in the placebo
group; approximately 50% of subjects who were p24 antigen-positive at entry and
who received AZT showed clearance or a greater than 50% reduction in baseline p24
antigen levels at 16 and 32 weeks. Thus, acid treatment of plasma may allow the
use of p24 antigen as a marker of disease progression and therapeutic response.
