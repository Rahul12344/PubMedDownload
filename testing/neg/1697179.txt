Overlapping decapeptides based on the sequences of two human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains (HXB2 and ELI) were used to identify an
immunodominant epitope of the nonstructural protein "out" (vpu) of the human
immunodeficiency virus type 1. Of 29 HIV-1 antibody-positive sera, 6 reacted with
decapeptides corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid sequence
VEMGVEMGHHAPWDVDDL of the "out" (vpu) protein. This oligopeptide was synthesized 
by the solid phase method and used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for screening of 243 HIV-1-seropositive and 75 HIV-1-seronegative
sera. It was found that 26% of the HIV-1 antibody-positive sera were reactive in 
the "out" (vpu) peptide ELISA, whereas none of the HIV-1-negative sera reacted
with the oligopeptide. Correlation of reactivity of sera with the Walter Reed
(WR) staging classification demonstrated that individuals classified WR 1 (36%)
and WR 2 (42%) were more often reactive than patients classified WR 3-6 (11%).
