Peripheral facial palsy and herpes zoster infection.

Mair IW, Flugsrud LB.

A clinical and virological study of 133 consecutive cases of peripheral facial
palsy has provided evidence for simultaneous infection with the varicella-zoster 
virus in 9 patients (6-8 per cent). Seven of these presented differing but
typical manifestations of the Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and the diagnosis was
therefore strongly suspected on the basis of the clinical findings alone. The
remaining two patients had neither herpetiform rash nor involvement of the eighth
cranial nerve, and had been diagnosed in the clinic as typical cases of Bell's
palsy. In this series the incidence of zoster infection in apparent idiopathic
facial palsy was 1-8 per cent.
