Efficient HIV-1 transduction depends on a number of cellular co-factors. Cellular
double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair proteins have been proposed, by ourselves
and others, to be required for efficient HIV-1 transduction. Expression and/or
activity of these DNA repair proteins can be induced by the introduction of DSBs 
into the host cell genome. HIV-1 transduction was up-regulated by treatment with 
DSB-inducing agents in both drug-arrested cells and differentiated neuronal
cells. The presented data support the hypothesis that DSB repair proteins are
involved in the early steps of the retroviral life-cycle.
