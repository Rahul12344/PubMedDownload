Mood, emotion, and cognition are modulated by the serotonergic midbrain raphe
system, which seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of psychiatric disorders
like those of the affective spectrum. Since a dysregulation of serotonin
transporter expression might be important in the course of those disorders, we
isolated and cloned the 5'-regulatory region of the serotonin transporter gene,
which is inducible by cAMP- and PKC-depended signal transduction pathways.
Systematic screening for length variations and functional promoter analyses
revealed a genetic polymorphism with allelic variation in transcriptional
activity and protein expression. This 5-HTT gene polymorphism comprises a
tandemly repeated sequence in the 5'-regulatory promoter region of the serotonin 
transporter gene. Recent population association studies demonstrated the 5-HTT
gene promoter polymorphism accounting for 4-5% of population variation of
anxiety-related behavioral traits.
