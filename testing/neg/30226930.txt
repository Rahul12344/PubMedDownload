High efficiency method of detection and isolation of neuraminidase inhibitor
resistant influenza viruses by fluorescence sialidase imaging.

[Article in English, Japanese]

Kurebayashi Y.

Influenza A and B viruses possess an enzyme "sialidase" that cleavages terminal
sialic acid from glycochains. These viral sialidase proteins are highly expressed
on the virus infected cells. We developed sialidase imaging probe "BTP3-Neu5Ac"
that enables histochemical fluorescence staining of sialidase activity.
BTP3-Neu5Ac was able to perform speedy and easy fluorescence imaging of these
virus infected cells, with no needs of specific antibody and cell fixation. In
addition, combination use of anti-influenza drugs (sialidase inhibitors) and
BTP3-Neu5Ac resulted in selective fluorescence imaging for detection and
high-efficiency isolation of drug-resistant virus. Fluorescence imaging of
drug-resistant virus will be a powerful method for study of the drug-resistance
mechanism, for monitoring of drug-resistant viruses. A novel tool for
fluorescence imaging of viral sialidase activity is described in this review.
