In order to study the genotypes and molecular evolution of human enterovirus
(HEV) A species in Shandong Province, Stool samples were collected from AFP and
HFMD patients in Shandong Province and virus isolation was performed. Reverse
Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) specific for EV71 and CVA16
were performed with the virus isolates from HFMD patients. Positive isolates were
selected for entire VP1 coding gene amplification and sequencing. Isolates with
negative PCR results and isolates from AFP patients were selected for entire VP1 
coding gene amplification and sequencing using primers specific for HEV A
species. Phylogenetic tree was constructed among these VP1 nucleotide sequences
and of other strains. Altogether 293 strains classified into 8 genotypes were
isolated. The homologous comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed Shandong
strains were distinct with prototype strains in every genotype. This report
presents an overview of HEV-A in Shandong Province.
