The outbreak of the 2009 influenza pandemic underscored the important role of
swine in influenza virus evolution and the emergence of novel viruses with
pandemic potential. Vaccination is the most common practice to control swine
influenza in swine industry. Influenza virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines are an 
alternative approach and have been demonstrated to be immunogenic and confer
protection against influenza virus challenge in chickens, mice and ferrets. In
this study, we generated VLPs consisting of HA, NA and M1 proteins derived from
pandemic virus A/California/04/2009 in insect cells. The immunogenicity and
efficacy following vaccination of VLPs were evaluated in swine. Our data showed
that vaccination using VLPs elicited robust levels of serum IgG, mucosal IgA, and
viral neutralizing antibodies against A/Sw/Manitoba/MAFRI32/2009 H1N1. Following 
challenge with pandemic H1N1 2009, vaccinated pigs were protected, displaying
reduced lung lesions, virus shedding and inhibition of virus replication in the
lungs compared to non-vaccinated control pigs. Thus, VLPs can serve as a
promising vaccination strategy to control influenza in swine.
