Role of interferon in prophylaxis of rabies after exposure.

Wiktor TJ, Koprowski H, Mitchell JR, Merigan TC.

Rhesus monkeys were completely protected from rabies by a single dose of
experimental, highly concentrated, rabies virus vaccine prepared from virus
propagated in cultures of human diploid cells and administered several hours
after infection with street rabies virus. Protection seemed to be related to the 
high antigenicity of the vaccine and to its ability to induce interferon in
vaccinated animals. Only partial protection was afforded by one or three
inoculations of less concentrated vaccines that were prepared from cultures of
human diploid cells or primary hamster kidney cells and that were not capable of 
inducing interferon. The level of virus-neutralizing antibody induced by
vaccination could not be correlated with the final outcome of the disease. The
simultaneous inoculation of vaccine and interferon inducers (polyribocytidylic
acid homopolymer pair or Newcastle disease virus) did not improve the results
obtained with vaccine along, a fact which indicates that factors other than
interferon and antibody may play an important role in the treatment of rabies
after exposure.
