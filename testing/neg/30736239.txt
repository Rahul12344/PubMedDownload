Foodborne illness may result in human beings from ingestion of fish food products
containing bacterial or parasitic pathogens. The bacterial pathogens include
Salmonella , Shigella , Streptococcus , Leptospira , Clostridium , Staphylococcus
, Mycobacterium , Erysipelotrix , Francisella , and Vibrio species. Parasitic
illness may result from Diphllobothrium latum , Clonorchis sinesis , Opisthorchis
felineus , Heterophyes heterophyes , Paragoniums westermani and Anisakis sp.
Fishborne intoxication include Ciguatera, Scombroid, and Puffer
icthyosarcotoxins, mercury, nitrite-nitrate, pesticides, radionclides, and the
toxin of Haff disease. Infections with Vibrio parahaemolyticus , Salmonella typhi
, and infectious hepatitis virus are associated with shellfish. Toxic substances 
found in shellfish include paralytic shellfish poison, mercury, pesticides, and
toxic hydrocarbons. Prevention of fish-and shellfish-associated illnesses of man 
is possible by: (a) using only fish and shellfish from unpolluted waters, (b) use
of proper refrigeration facilities, (c) practicing strict sanitation in
processing plants and storage facilities, (d) assuring foodhandlers are free of
disease, (e) cooking thoroughly all fish and shellfish before eating, and (f) not
handling aquatic foods when one has wounds or abrasions.
