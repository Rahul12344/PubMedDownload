The alkaloids berberine, palmatine and sanguinarine are toxic to insects and
vertebrates and inhibit the multiplication of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
Biochemical properties which may contribute to these allelochemical activities
were analysed. Acetylcholine esterase, butyrylcholinesterase, choline acetyl
transferase, alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic, nicotinergic, muscarinergic and
serotonin2 receptors were substantially affected. Sanguinarine appears to be the 
most effective inhibitor of choline acetyl-transferase (IC50 284 nM), while the
protoberberines were inactive at this target. Berberine and palmatine were most
active at the alpha 2-receptor (binding with IC50 476 and 956 nM, respectively). 
Furthermore, berberine and sanguinarine intercalate DNA, inhibit DNA synthesis
and reverse transcriptase. In addition, sanguinarine (but not berberine) affects 
membrane permeability and berberine protein biosynthesis. In consequence, these
biochemical activities may mediate chemical defence against microorganisms,
viruses and herbivores in the plants producing these alkaloids.
