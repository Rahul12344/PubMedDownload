Extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by virus-infected cells typically
incorporate host and viral components inside the vesicles (cargo molecules).
Here, we investigated if human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins are incorporated
in EV outer membrane released by HCMV-infected cells. We separated EVs from HCMV 
using an iodixanol step-gradient and found that the separated vesicles carried EV
markers such as the tetraspanin CD63 and Rab27A. Flow analysis of individual EVs 
demonstrated that on average, 15 ± 3.7% of EVs were positive for gB, 5.3 ± 2.3%
were positive for gH and 3.74 ± 1.5% were positive for both gB and gH. In light
of previous findings demonstrating HIV envelope proteins in EV membranes, the
presence of viral protein at the surface of EVs released by HCMV-infected cells
indicated that viral membrane proteins incorporated in EVs released by
virus-infected cells may be a general phenomenon.
