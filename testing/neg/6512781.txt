Influence of naproxen therapy on natural killer cytotoxicity and
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against cells infected with herpes
simplex virus.

Gonik B, Loo LS, Bigelow R, Kohl S.

Natural killer cytotoxicity (NKC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC) represent one of the body's primary lines of defense against viral
infections, including herpes simplex (HSV). This immune defense system is
negatively influenced by prostaglandins. A project was undertaken to evaluate the
influence of an antiprostaglandin agent in vivo on these cytotoxic effects
against cells infected with HSV. Thirteen subjects without previous histories of 
clinical herpes simplex infection were studied during menses with and without
naproxen therapy. A statistically significant augmentation (p = 0.05) of natural 
killer-cell function was identified in mononuclear cells during therapy. Subjects
with baseline cytotoxicity of less than 45% demonstrated consistent elevations
during naproxen therapy. No other significant differences could be found for
mononuclear or polymorphonuclear cells with regard to NKC and ADCC. There appears
to be a subset of patients who may benefit from immunologic augmentation with
antiprostaglandin agents when experiencing herpes simplex virus infection.
