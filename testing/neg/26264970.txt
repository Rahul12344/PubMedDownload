To identify ranavirus virulence genes, we engineered Frog Virus 3 (FV3) knockout 
(KO) mutants defective for a putative viral caspase activation and recruitment
domain-containing (CARD) protein (Δ64R-FV3) and a β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
homolog (Δ52L-FV3). Compared to wild type (WT) FV3, infection of Xenopus tadpoles
with Δ64R- or Δ52L-FV3 resulted in significantly lower levels of mortality and
viral replication. We further characterized these and two earlier KO mutants
lacking the immediate-early18kDa protein (FV3-Δ18K) or the truncated viral
homolog of eIF-2α (FV3-ΔvIF-2α). All KO mutants replicated as well as WT-FV3 in
non-amphibian cell lines, whereas in Xenopus A6 kidney cells replication of
ΔvCARD-, ΔvβHSD- and ΔvIF-2α-FV3 was markedly reduced. Furthermore, Δ64R- and
ΔvIF-2α-FV3 were more sensitive to interferon than WT and Δ18-FV3. Notably,
Δ64R-, Δ18K- and ΔvIF-2α- but not Δ52L-FV3 triggered more apoptosis than WT FV3. 
These data suggest that vCARD (64R) and vβ-HSD (52L) genes contribute to viral
pathogenesis.
