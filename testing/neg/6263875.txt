Carbohydrate structures of HVJ (Sendai virus) glycoproteins.

Yoshima H, Nakanishi M, Okada Y, Kobata A.

The carbohydrate structures of two membrane glycoproteins (HANA protein and F
protein) of HVJ have been determined on materials purified from virions grown in 
the allantoic sac of embryonated chicken eggs. Both glycoproteins contain fucose,
mannose, galactose, and glucosamine but not galactosamine, indicating that their 
sugar chains are exclusively of the asparagine-linked type. The radioactive
oligosaccharide fractions obtained from the two glycoproteins by hydrazinolysis
followed by NaB[3H]4 reduction gave quite distinct fractionation patterns after
paper electrophoresis. More than 75% of the oligosaccharides from F protein were 
acidic and separated into at least four components by paper electrophoresis. Only
18% of the oligosaccharide from HANA protein was an acidic single component.
These acidic oligosaccharides could not be converted to neutral oligosaccharides 
by sialidase digestion. Structural studies of the neutral oligosaccharide
fractions from HANA and F proteins revealed that both of them are mixtures of a
series of high mannose type oligosaccharides and of complex type oligosaccharides
with Gal beta 1 leads to (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3) GlcNAc group in their outer
chain moieties.
