OBJECTIVE: The measles virus has been implicated as a possible etiological agent 
in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Measles infection at an
early age is associated with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a degenerative 
neurological condition caused by persistent measles infection of the central
nervous system. We sought to determine whether infection with measles virus at an
early age was also associated with an increased risk of developing IBD.
METHODS: Patients with measles infection diagnosed before the age of 5 yr were
identified through the diagnostic indices of the Mayo Clinic and the Rochester
Epidemiology Project. A questionnaire was used to ascertain a subsequent history 
of IBD, which was confirmed by records from the subjects' physicians. The risks
of developing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were calculated relative to 
expected rates for these conditions in the Olmsted County, Minnesota population.
RESULTS: Of 1164 eligible cases, 662 (57%) completed the questionnaire. There
were six confirmed cases of Crohn's disease and six of ulcerative colitis. The
expected number of cases was 1.9 for Crohn's disease (standardized incidence
ratio [SIR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-6.8) and 2.0 for ulcerative
colitis (SIR 3.0, CI 1.1-6.5). There was a trend towards a higher risk of
developing IBD with an earlier age of infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Early measles infection is associated with an increased risk of
developing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The risk may be higher with
earlier infection.
