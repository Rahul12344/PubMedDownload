RATIONALE: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM-2) is a cell
surface receptor primarily expressed on macrophages and monocyte-derived cells.
TREM-2 not only functions as a regulator of inflammatory response, but also
serves as a phagocytic receptor for bacteria. However, the role of TREM-2 in
sepsis remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether TREM-2 plays a role in sepsis.
METHODS: The manner of expression of TREM-2 was evaluated in patients with sepsis
and in polymicrobial septic mouse model induced by the cecum ligation and
puncture approach. Recombinant mouse TREM-2 was used to block the effect of
TREM-2. Bone marrow-derived myeloid cells (BMMCs) that overexpress TREM-2 were
administrated into septic mice at various times after cecum ligation and
puncture.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The expression levels of TREM-2 were up-regulated 
in patients with sepsis and septic mice. The kinetics of TREM-2 expression in
polymicrobial sepsis was comparable with that of bacteria burden in peritoneal
lavage fluid. Blocking the effect of TREM-2 resulted in markedly increased
mortality and bacterial burden in polymicrobial sepsis. Administration of
TREM-2-overexpressing BMMCs significantly reduced the mortality, even when it was
administered 4 hours after the initiation of sepsis. However, injection of
TREM-2-overexpressing BMMCs into LPS-challenged endotoxemia mice did not improve 
the survival rate. The protective effect of TREM-2 in polymicrobial sepsis was
not associated with its antiinflammatory properties, but it enhanced bacterial
clearance in vivo. Furthermore, administration of TREM-2-overexpressing BMMCs
improved the organ injury.
CONCLUSIONS: TREM-2 plays an important role in the host defense response to
sepsis by enhancing bacterial clearance.
