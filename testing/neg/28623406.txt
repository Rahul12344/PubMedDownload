Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has emerged as a global health issue, but no
approved medication is available. The nucleoside analogue 2'-C-methylcytidine
(2CMC), a viral polymerase inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit infection with a 
variety of viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here, we report that 2CMC 
significantly inhibits the replication of HEV in a subgenomic replication model
and in a system using a full-length infectious virus. Importantly, long-term
treatment with 2CMC did not result in a loss of antiviral potency, indicating a
high barrier to drug resistance development. However, the combination of 2CMC
with ribavirin, an off-label treatment for HEV, exerts antagonistic effects. Our 
results indicate that 2CMC serves as a potential antiviral drug against HEV
infection.
