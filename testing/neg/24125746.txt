Human vaccines against three viruses use recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) 
as the antigen: hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, and hepatitis E virus.
VLPs are excellent prophylactic vaccine antigens because they are self-assembling
bionanoparticles (20 to 60 nm in diameter) that expose multiple epitopes on their
surface and faithfully mimic the native virions. Here we summarize the long
journey of these vaccines from bench to patients. The physical properties and
structural features of each recombinant VLP vaccine are described. With the
recent licensure of Hecolin against hepatitis E virus adding a third disease
indication to prophylactic VLP-based vaccines, we review how the crucial quality 
attributes of VLP-based human vaccines against all three disease indications were
assessed, controlled, and improved during bioprocessing through an array of
structural and functional analyses.
