Various materials from two White Leghorn basic breeder flocks were tested by the 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the complement fixation test (CFT) for
detection of avian leukosis/sarcoma virus (ALV) group-specific (gs) antigens and 
the phenotypic mixing test (PMT) to compare the applicability of these techniques
for the identification of hens which congenitally excrete exogenous ALV. The
predictive value of each test was evaluated on the basis of association between
ALV gs-antigen detection and ALV recovery and congenital virus transmission
demonstrable in the hens. In materials from two flocks under study a close
correlation was observed between congenital transmission of exogenous ALV to
embryos and ALV gs-antigen detection in albumen samples. Results of examinations 
of vaginal/cloaca swabs and meconium samples were poorly associated with
congenital virus excretion. ALV gs-antigen levels were generally higher in
embryos than in albumen samples. Considerable variations in gs-antigen levels
were observed in embryos and albumen samples from eggs of individual ALV shedding
hens and also within a series of embryos from eggs of one hen.
