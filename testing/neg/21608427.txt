hen compared with Thailand, the seroprevalence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) is
extremely high among its neighbouring countries. To investigate the
seroprevalence of HAV among the Thai people residing in the border area between
Thailand and Myanmar, 308 residents in Umphang, Maesod district, Tak, were
recruited. Sera were tested for HAV IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. The overall seroprevalence among the Thai people residing in the border
area of Thailand was significantly higher than that among the general Thai
population (71% vs 27% respectively, p < 0.05). As asymptomatic or mild HAV
infection typically occurs in children, the Thai people residing in the border
area may receive little benefit from universal HAV vaccination. Lower protective 
antibodies against HAV, along with the exclusion of HAV vaccine from the Expanded
Programme on Immunization, potentially increase the susceptibility to HAV among
the general Thai population and may lead to more future outbreaks if HAV is
introduced from the border areas. The findings suggest that HAV vaccines should
be recommended to travellers before their journey to the border between Thailand 
and Myanmar where HAV is endemic.
