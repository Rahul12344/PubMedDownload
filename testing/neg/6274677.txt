Effects of Sendai virus infection on body weight, body temperature and some
hematological and serobiochemical values of mice.

Itoh T, Iwai H.

Body weight and body temperature of JCL: ICR mice infected with Sendai virus
decreased depending on the viral dose. In severely infected mice, there were
significantly higher values of hemoglobin, hematocrit, red and white blood cell
counts, and leucin aminopeptidase (LAP), and lower values of reticulocytes and
lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). The other values tested were comparable to those of
the non-infected mice.
