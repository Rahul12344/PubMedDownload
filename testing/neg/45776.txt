We investigated the possible side chain/side chain interactions of four potential
transmembrane proteins. The basic assumptions are that the proteins are
alpha-helical, and that the proteins aggregate with knobs-into-holes packing. It 
was found that these four proteins can be assembled into stereochemically
feasible bundles of alpha-helices with hydrophobic exteriors and with hydrogen
bonds between the side chains of one alpha-helix and the side chains of its
knobs-into-holes packed neighbors.
