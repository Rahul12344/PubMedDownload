OBJECTIVE: Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is expressed
prominently in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), but the
specific contribution of MT1-MMP to fibroblast-mediated destruction of articular 
cartilage is incompletely understood. This study used gene transfer of an
antisense expression construct to assess the effects of MT1-MMP inhibition on the
invasiveness of RASFs.
METHODS: Retroviral gene transfer of a pLXIN vector-based antisense RNA
expression construct (MT1-MMPalphaS) to MT1-MMP was used to stably transduce
RASFs. Levels of MT1-MMP RNA and protein were determined by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunocytochemistry in
MT1-MMPalphaS-transduced RASFs as well as in control cells, with monitoring for
60 days. The effects of MT1-MMPalphaS on the invasiveness of RASFs were analyzed 
in the SCID mouse co-implantation model of RA.
RESULTS: MT1-MMPalphaS-transduced RASFs produced high levels of antisense RNA
that exceeded endogenous levels of MT1-MMP messenger RNA by 15-fold and resulted 
in a down-regulation of MT1-MMP at the protein level. Inhibition of MT1-MMP
production was maintained for 60 days and significantly reduced the invasiveness 
of RASFs in the SCID mouse model. Whereas prominent invasion into cartilage by
non-transduced and mock-transduced RASFs was observed (mean invasion scores 3.0
and 3.1, respectively), MT1-MMPalphaS-transduced cells showed only moderate
invasiveness (mean invasion score 1.8; P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that an antisense RNA expression construct
against MT1-MMP can be generated and expressed in RASFs for at least 60 days.
Inhibition of MT1-MMP significantly reduces the cartilage degradation by RASFs.
