Six deletion mutations and an insertion were generated in the env gene of cloned 
copies of Moloney murine leukemia virus DNA. All seven mutants were
replication-defective as tested by transformation of NIH/3T3 cells. The mutant
DNAs were introduced into NIH/3T3 cells to generate stable producer lines; all
released virion particles into the medium, suggesting that none of the mutations 
affected overall viral gene expression, gag and pol gene expression, gag and pol 
gene functions, or virion budding. Several of the mutations reduced the lifetime 
of the env protein or blocked its export to the cell surface. One mutation
altering the membrane-spanning region and the cytoplasmic tail of the TM protein 
had no effect on export of the protein, proteolytic processing, or incorporation 
into virion particles, but still blocked the infectivity of the resulting virus. 
The results suggest that alterations in the transmembrane region can affect early
steps of infection, such as the fusion of virion and host membranes. Cells
expressing this mutant env protein were fully resistant to superinfection by
wild-type virus. Thus, induction of virus resistance, presumably reflecting
blocking the virus receptor, can be separated from virus infectivity.
