Plum pox virus (PPV) sweet (SwC) and sour (SoC) cherry isolates were the first
PPV isolates to be recovered from natural infection in sweet and sour cherry
plants, respectively. Their complete nucleotide sequences have been determined
finding a deduced genome organisation typical for PPV species. Both genomes are
9795 nucleotides long, excluding the 3' terminal poly(A) tail, and contain an
open reading frame of 9432 nt, encoding a polyprotein of 3143 amino acids. The
nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of PPV-SwC and SoC have been
pairwise compared with available sequences of different PPV strains. Although a
very high similarity exists between the whole genomes and polyproteins of the two
cherry isolates, high levels of divergence have been calculated with sequences of
PPV-M, D and EA isolates. In particular, the most considerable divergence has
been found in part of 5' non coding region, in regions encoding P1, P3 + 6K1, 6K2
and NIa-VPg proteins as well as in the N-terminal domain of the coat protein.
Phylogenetic analysis have been undertaken in order to establish the taxonomic
localisation of SwC and SoC isolates within PPV species, showing that they are
always clustered together and separated from the rest of PPV strains, being
clearly the most distant.
