BACKGROUND: There have been limited studies directly comparing the long-term
efficacy between entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). This
study was aimed to compare the long-term efficacy between them in treatment-naïve
chronic hepatitis B (CHB).
METHODS: Out of 345 CHB patients who received first line therapy with ETV
(n = 200) or TDF (n = 145) in a cohort, 210 patients were analyzed using
propensity score matching, at a ratio of 1:1.
RESULTS: Two groups showed no difference in baseline characteristics. During the 
follow-up of 12 months, HBV DNA levels were similarly suppressed in both groups
(ETV vs. TDF; -5.01 vs. -5.242 log10IU/mL, P = 0.559). At month 12, both groups
showed no difference in terms of the serologic, biochemical and virologic (VR)
response. In multivariate analysis, the initial virologic response at 3 months
(IVR-3) was independent factor for VR at 1 year. During the long-term follow-up, 
HBV DNA levels were more strongly suppressed by TDF than ETV in hepatitis B e
antigen (HBeAg) positive patients (P = 0.035), especially with high viral load
(P = 0.012), although there was no significant difference in overall VR between
two groups. The type of antivirals was not an independent factor for long-term
VR.
CONCLUSIONS: Although either ETV or TDF, overall, may show a comparable long-term
antiviral efficacy in treatment-naïve CHB, TDF might be better regimen than ETV
in the subgroup of HBeAg-positive CHB, especially with a higher HBV DNA levels.
