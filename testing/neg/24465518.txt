Sex-related differences in susceptibility to pathogens are a common phenomenon in
animals. In the eusocial Hymenoptera the two female castes, workers and queens,
are diploid and males are haploid. The haploid susceptibility hypothesis predicts
that haploid males are more susceptible to pathogen infections compared to
females. Here we test this hypothesis using adult male (drone) and female
(worker) honey bees (Apis mellifera), inoculated with the gut endoparasite Nosema
ceranae and/or black queen cell virus (BQCV). These pathogens were chosen due to 
previously reported synergistic interactions between Nosema apis and BQCV. Our
data do not support synergistic interactions between N. ceranae and BQCV and also
suggest that BQCV has limited effect on both drone and worker health, regardless 
of the infection level. However, the data clearly show that, despite lower levels
of N. ceranae spores in drones than in workers, Nosema-infected drones had both a
higher mortality and a lower body mass than non-infected drones, across all
treatment groups, while the mortality and body mass of worker bees were largely
unaffected by N. ceranae infection, suggesting that drones are more susceptible
to this pathogen than workers. In conclusion, the data reveal considerable
sex-specific differences in pathogen susceptibility in honey bees and highlight
the importance of ultimate measures for determining susceptibility, such as
mortality and body quality, rather than mere infection levels.
