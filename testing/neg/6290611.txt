Neoplastic transformation of one-day-old hamster brain cells was produced by
infection with SV-40 virus and verified by phase contrast microscopy, growth in
semisolid media, and intracranial tumor production after inoculation of the cells
into other one-day-old hamsters. Transformed cells were studied by transmission
and scanning electron microscopy. The numerous alterations in cell surface
structure and in nuclear and cytoplasmic organization suggest a marked increase
in cell metabolism and in the rate of mitosis and cell division. Cilia with a
nine-to-zero pattern of microtubule doublets were present in cells with
intermediate size filaments which stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein.
The findings indicate that infection of one-day-old hamster brain cells in
culture by SV-40 virus results in their transformation to a neoplastic state and 
the transformed cells are differentiating neoplastic astrocytes.
