Chandipura virus, a member of the rhabdoviridae family and vesiculovirus genera, 
has recently emerged as human pathogen that is associated with a number of
outbreaks in different parts of India. Although, the virus closely resembles with
the prototype vesiculovirus, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, it could be readily
distinguished by its ability to infect humans. Studies on Chandipura virus while 
shed light into distinct stages of viral infection; it may also allow us to
identify potential drug targets for antiviral therapy. In this review, we have
summarized our current understanding of Chandipura virus life cycle at the
molecular detail with particular interest in viral RNA metabolisms, namely
transcription, replication and packaging of viral RNA into nucleocapsid
structure. Contemporary research on otherwise extensively studied family member
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus has also been addressed to present a more
comprehensive picture of vesiculovirus life cycle. Finally, we reveal examples of
protein economy in Chandipura virus life-cycle whereby each viral protein has
evolved complexity to perform multiple tasks.
