BACKGROUND: There is evidence that norovirus genotype is an important factor in
determining norovirus epidemiology, but detailed information is lacking. This
report examined this question by studying whether the mix of norovirus genotypes 
associated with norovirus outbreaks in health care settings was different to that
in nonhealth care settings.
METHODS: Norovirus outbreaks tested in Victoria, Australia, 2002-2005 were
classified as either health care or nonhealth care. Open reading frame 1
nucleotide sequencing analysis was then used to determine the mix of norovirus
genotypes in health care and nonhealth care norovirus outbreaks.
RESULTS: For the three most common genotypes detected (GI.2, GII.4, and GIIb),
the differences between health care and nonhealth care settings were significant.
GII.4 was significantly more common in health care settings than in nonhealth
care settings, whereas the genotypes GI.2 and GIIb were significantly more common
in nonhealth care settings than in health care settings.
CONCLUSION: Norovirus genotype was found to be an important factor associated
with norovirus outbreak setting.
