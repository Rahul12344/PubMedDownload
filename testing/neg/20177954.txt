We report a case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease in a 30-year-old patient
who was receiving interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy for chronic hepatitis C 
virus infection. The intraocular inflammation responded to systemic
corticosteroid and mycophenolate mofetil treatment. Physicians should be aware of
the association between interferon-alpha and ribavirin therapy for hepatitis C
virus infection and the development of VKH disease.
