The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, at one time fatal, has now become a 
chronic disease. Physically, patients are generally in good health. However, 35
years after the discovery of the virus, mental suffering is still very much
present. Morbid representations, understandable given the history of the disease,
are still active on an individual level as well as on a broader level within
society. Adapted information campaigns are essential in order to change
behaviour.
