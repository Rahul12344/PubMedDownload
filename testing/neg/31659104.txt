BACKGROUND/AIM: Proteomics of invasiveness opens a window on the complexity of
the metastasis-engaged mechanisms. The extend and types of this complexity
require elucidation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Proteomics, immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, network 
analysis and systems cancer biology were used to analyse acquisition of
invasiveness by human breast adenocarcinoma cells.
RESULTS: We report here that invasiveness network highlighted the involvement of 
hallmarks such as cell proliferation, migration, cell death, genome stability,
immune system regulation and metabolism. Identified involvement of cell-virus
interaction and gene silencing are potentially novel cancer mechanisms.
Identified 6,113 nodes with 11,055 edges affecting 1,085 biological processes
show extensive re-arrangements in cell physiology. These high numbers are in line
with a similar broadness of networks built with diagnostic signatures approved
for clinical use.
CONCLUSION: Our data emphasize a broad systemic regulation of invasiveness, and
describe the network of this regulation.
