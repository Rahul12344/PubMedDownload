Since the 1980s, there has been a worldwide re-emergence of vector-borne diseases
including Malaria, Dengue, Yellow fever or, more recently, chikungunya. These
viruses are arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by arthropods like 
mosquitoes of Aedes genus. The nature of these arboviruses is complex since it
conjugates human, environmental, biological and geographical factors. Recent
researchs have suggested, in particular during the Reunion Island epidemic in
2006, that the transmission by Aedes albopictus (an Aedes genus specie) has been 
facilitated by genetic mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to
non tropical regions. In this paper we formulate an optimal control problem,
based on biological observations. Three main efforts are considered in order to
limit the virus transmission. Indeed, there is no vaccine nor specific treatment 
against chikungunya, that is why the main measures to limit the impact of such
epidemic have to be considered. Therefore, we look at time dependent breeding
sites destruction, prevention and treatment efforts, for which optimal control
theory is applied. Using analytical and numerical techniques, it is shown that
there exist cost effective control efforts.
