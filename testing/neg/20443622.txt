Signature peptides of the neuraminidase antigen across all common circulating
human subtypes of type A and B influenza are identified through the bioinformatic
alignment of translated gene sequences. The detection of these peptides within
the high-resolution mass spectra of whole antigen, virus, and vaccine digests
enables the strains to be rapidly and directly typed and subtyped. Importantly,
unique signature peptides for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza are identified and
detected that enable pandemic strains to be rapidly and directly differentiated
from seasonal type A (H1N1) influenza strains. The detection of these peptides
can enable the origins of the neuraminidase gene to be monitored in the case of
reassorted strains.
