A model of secondary structure common for the central part (ca. 400 nucleotides) 
of the 5'-untranslated regions (5'-UTR) of all the so far sequenced genomes of
polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and rhinoviruses was derived on the basis of
evolutionary and thermodynamic considerations. According to the model, this part 
of the genome comprises three domains, which appear to be involved, at least in
the poliovirus genome, in the control of viral neurovirulence and in vitro
translation. Some salient features of this model were supported by investigating 
RNAs of five poliovirus and one coxsackievirus strains with respect to their
accessibility to modifications with dimethyl sulfate and sensitivity to
single-strand- and double-strand-specific nucleases. In contrast to the previous 
suggestion, no major changes in the conformation of the Sabin vaccine poliovirus 
type 3 5'-UTR due to the transition in position 472 were observed. The biological
relevance of the conserved primary and secondary structure elements in the
picornaviral 5'-UTRs is discussed.
