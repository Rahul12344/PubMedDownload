Influenza viruses are severe human pathogens that pose persistent threat to
public health. Each year more people die of influenza virus infection than that
of breast cancer. Due to the limited efficacy associated with current influenza
vaccines, as well as emerging drug resistance from small molecule antiviral
drugs, there is a clear need to develop new antivirals with novel mechanisms of
action. The influenza virus polymerase complex has become a promising target for 
the development of the next-generation of antivirals for several reasons.
Firstly, the influenza virus polymerase, which forms a heterotrimeric complex
that consists of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits, is highly conserved. Secondly, both
individual polymerase subunit (PA, PB1, and PB2) and inter-subunit interactions
(PA-PB1, PB1- PB2) represent promising drug targets. Lastly, growing insight into
the structure and function of the polymerase complex has spearheaded the
structure-guided design of new polymerase inhibitors. In this review, we
highlight recent progress in drug discovery and assay development targeting the
influenza virus polymerase complex and discuss their therapeutic potentials.
