The effect of alpha-interferon on the hepatitis C genotypes was examined in 25
anti-HCV-positive haemophilic patients. The rate of multiple HCV genotypes in
patients who are likely to have mixed infections was also studied. Pretreatment
results showed that 3/25 (12%) patients had a change in genotypes, whereas
posttreatment this rose to 10/25 (40%). Seven of 10 (70%) patients who showed a
change in genotype had a clinical response to alpha-interferon. Six of 25 (24%)
patients showed a complete clinical response to alpha-interferon, and the
majority of these were either type 2 or 3. This study supports previous evidence 
that type 1 is less likely to respond to alpha-interferon, and that
alpha-interferon may alter the concentrations of the various circulating
genotypes present in multiply-infected patients. There are many difficulties in
studying hepatitis C in haemophilic patients due to the sequence heterogeneity
within each individual, and this study has shown that no ideal method exists as
yet for looking at HCV genotypes in multiply-infected individuals.
