Due to the emergence of non-endemic mosquito vectors and the recent outbreaks of 
mosquito-borne diseases, mosquito-borne pathogens are considered an increasing
risk to public and animal health in Europe. To obtain a status quo regarding
mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in Germany, 97,648 mosquitoes collected 
from 2011 to 2016 throughout the country were screened for arboviruses.
Mosquitoes were identified to species, pooled in groups of up to 50 individuals
according to sampling location and date, and screened with different PCR assays
for Flavi-, Alpha- and Orthobunyavirus RNA. Two pools tested positive for Usutu
virus-RNA, two for Sindbis virus-RNA, and 24 for Batai virus-RNA. The pools
consisted of Culex pipiens s.l., Culex modestus, Culex torrentium, Culiseta sp., 
Aedes vexans, Anopheles daciae, and Anopheles messeae mosquitoes and could be
assigned to nine different collection sites, with seven of them located in
northeastern Germany. Phylogenetic analyses of the viral RNA sequences showed
relationships with strains of the viruses previously demonstrated in Germany.
These findings confirm continuing mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus circulation
even though only a rather small percentage of the screened samples tested
positive. With respect to sampling sites and periods, virus circulation seems to 
be particularly intense in floodplains and after flooding events when mosquitoes 
develop in excessive numbers and where they have numerous avian hosts available
to feed on.
