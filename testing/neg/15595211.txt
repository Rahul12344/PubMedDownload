Closely related natural Plum pox virus (PPV) isolates derived from homologous RNA
recombination between PPV-D and PPV-M have been recently identified and shown
naturally spread in several European countries. As their serological properties
were identical with those of conventional PPV-M isolates, they could be detected 
only by combined analysis of at least two different genome parts. To simplify the
detection of such recombinants primers specific to PPV-M and PPV-D sequences with
binding sites located on both sides of the recombination crossover situated in
the C-terminal part of NIb were designed. They were used for direct
differentiation of PPV-M, PPV-D and their recombinants by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This method is convenient for
identification of a recombinant PPV in single as well as mixed infection with
PPV-M or PPV-D.
