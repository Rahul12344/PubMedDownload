Complete nucleotide sequence of the influenza B/Singapore/222/79 virus
hemagglutinin gene and comparison with the B/Lee/40 hemagglutinin.

The complete nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the human type
B influenza virus B/Singapore/222/79 is presented. Comparison with the only other
known sequence of a B hemagglutinin (B/Lee/40) shows that antigenic drift in type
B HA genes is essentially the same as already observed within the influenza A H3 
subtype, i.e., an accumulation of point mutations. The main difference is that
the apparent evolution is significantly slower, most likely due to the cumulative
effect of a lower occurrence in the population (slower evolution) and/or less
immunological pressure. There is a striking cluster of changes at positions 127
until 137 of the HA1 subunit which may represent one of the antigenic sites of
the molecule.
