Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations or
deletions in Methyl-CpG-binding Protein 2 (MeCP2), a brain-enriched
transcriptional regulator. MeCP2 is highly expressed during neuronal maturation
and its deficiency results in impaired dendritic morphogenesis and reduced
dendritic spine numbers in developing neurons. However, whether MeCP2 deficiency 
impacts the integration of new neurons has not been directly assessed. In this
study, we developed a modified rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic retrograde
tracing method to interrogate presynaptic integration of MeCP2-deficient new
neurons born in the adult hippocampus, a region with lifelong neurogenesis and
plasticity. We found that selective deletion of MeCP2 in adult-born new neurons
impaired their long-range connectivity to the cortex, whereas their connectivity 
within the local hippocampal circuits or with subcortical regions was not
significantly affected. We further showed that knockdown of MeCP2 in primary
hippocampal neurons also resulted in reduced network integration. Interestingly, 
(1-3) insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a small peptide under clinical trial 
testing for RTT, rescued neuronal integration deficits of MeCP2-deficient neurons
in vitro but not in vivo. In addition, (1-3) IGF-1 treatment corrected aberrant
excitability and network synchrony of MeCP2-deficient hippocampal neurons. Our
results indicate that MeCP2 is essential for immature neurons to establish
appropriate network connectivity.
