The epidemiology of pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Rubinstein A, Bernstein L.

HTLV III infection of children exhibits a relatively narrow spectrum in which the
majority of patients develop clinical manifestations before the age of 2 years.
In most instances the disease is transmitted in utero, whereby 35-65% of HTLV
III-positive women give birth to an infected child. Discordant infection in twins
is described. In fewer cases the disease is acquired through blood transfusions. 
In exceptional cases transmission via sexual abuse or use of needles may occur in
young children. We have no evidence of intrafamilial horizontal disease
transmission from child to child. The number of children with the disease may
increase sharply. Around 2000 pregnancies in HTLV III-infected women are
projected in New York City in the next year. Should all these pregnancies be
completed, several hundred additional cases of pediatric AIDS may be expected in 
1986.
