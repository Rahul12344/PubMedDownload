Effect of a mouse mammary tumor virus-derived protein vaccine on primary tumor
development in mice.

Creemers P, Ouwehand J, Bentvelzen P.

The vaccines used in this study were derived from purified murine mammary tumor
virus (MuMTV) preparations. Approximately 60% of the protein fractions consisted 
of the major viral membrane glycoprotein gp52. Inoculation sc of 10 microgram
MuMTV-S-derived vaccine significantly delayed the appearance of primary mammary
tumors in GR and BALB/cfC3H mice (strains with high incidences of mammary
cancer); in BALB/c and C3Hf mice, which have a moderate tumor incidence at an
advanced age, this treatment resulted in a slight and substantial acceleration,
respectively, of primary tumor development. The induced cellular immune
reactivity for vaccination, as measured with the in vivo Winn test and the in
vitro leukocyte adherence inhibition assay, was strongest in the GR strain as
compared to the BALB/c strain. The titer of antibodies to tumor cells, as
estimated by membrane immunofluorescence, was also higher in the GR strain. In
BALB/cfC3H mice, the influence of different vaccination schemes with an
MuMTV-O-derived protein vaccine on primary tumor development was studied. Before 
sc injection, the vaccine was precipitated on alum. A dose of 10 microgram
vaccine resulted in a 61% decrease in tumor incidence. Two or five additional
booster injections with 1 microgram protein vaccine had no beneficial effect,
although the amount of antibody measured was increased after boosting.
