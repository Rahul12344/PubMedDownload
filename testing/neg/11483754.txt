Intravenous infection of cats with feline immunodeficiency virus was used as a
model system to study activation of virus replication in brain-resident
microglial cells in vitro. Virus release by ramified microglial cells isolated
from subclinically infected animals was detectable in cell-free tissue culture
supernatant only by reverse transcription and nested PCR of gag-specific RNA
sequences and not by virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity. In
contrast, cocultivation of in vivo-infected microglial cells with
mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) regularly allows
detection of high virus yields in cell-free tissue culture fluid. Besides uptake 
and multiplication of microglia-derived virus in PBMC, release of virus from
microglia is stimulated by cell contact with PBMC. The data suggest that T
lymphocytes patrolling the central nervous system could reactivate the semilatent
state of lentiviruses in microglial cells in the course of clinically silent
central nervous system infection.
