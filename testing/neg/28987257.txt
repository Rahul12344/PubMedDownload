Gastroenterologists and hepatologists will encounter oncology patients who
develop abnormal liver tests, patients with hepatic malignancies, and patients
with acute and chronic liver disease who require chemotherapy or immediate
evaluation. Chemotherapy can cause liver injury owing to toxic effects or
idiosyncratic reactions. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may be associated with
autoimmune-mediated liver toxicities. Venoocclusive disease requires immediate
evaluation. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia is a chronic progressive disorder.
Screening and prophylaxis for reactivation of hepatitis B is important to
minimize complications in patients receiving chemotherapy. Patients with
metastatic lesions can undergo resection or ablation. Hepatic injury may occur in
those receiving radiation-based therapies.
