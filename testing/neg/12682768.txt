BACKGROUND: Pupillary disorders following varicella infections are rare and few
cases have been reported which were only partially pharmacologically tested.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 5-year-old boy presented with a left-sided dilated and
unreactive pupil, 3 months before he had suffered from chickenpox and in the
course of the acute disease developed anterior uveitis which was treated with
local prednisone and mydriatics. The pupil remained dilated despite discontinued 
medication, light reaction was absent and accommodation was impaired. Pilocarpine
supersensitivity was an indication against a lesion of the sphincter muscle and
reduced response to cholinesterase inhibitors (physostigmine) pointed towards a
postganglionic lesion.
CONCLUSIONS: It is probable that a varicella virus infection of the short ciliary
nerves and the ciliary ganglion caused anterior uveitis and a postganglionic
parasympathetic nerve lesion, clinically presenting as a tonic pupil. According
to cases previously reported an irreversible nerve lesion has to be assumed.
