[Immunologic aspects of preparation of antiserum to the reverse transcriptase
from avian myeloblastosis virus].

[Article in Russian]

Graevskaia NA, Sito AF.

After immunization of rabbits the antiserum was prepared against purified reverse
transcriptase (revertase) from avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). The antiserum
demonstrated enzymeneutralizing antibody activity that was associated with
ummunoglobulin G fraction but not with IgM. The high antigenicity of AMV
revertase for rabbits was shown. The active antiserum was obtained after 4
immunizations of rabbit with approximately 20 microgram of the enzyme.
Non-specific revertase inhibitors were found in normal rabbit serum, which were
absent in IgG fraction from this serum. The revertase activity of Rauscher
leukemia virus (RLV) and Visna virus was not neutralized by antisera against AMV 
polymerase. This work was supported by the project "Revertase".
