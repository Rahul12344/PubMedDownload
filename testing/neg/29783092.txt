A systematic review of longitudinal studies suggests that intimate partner
violence (IPV) is associated with reduced contraceptive use, but most included
studies were limited to two time points. We used seven waves of data from the
Rakai Community Cohort Study in Rakai, Uganda to estimate the effect of prior
year IPV at one visit on women's current contraceptive use at the following
visit. We used inverse probability of treatment-weighted marginal structural
models (MSMs) to estimate the relative risk of current contraceptive use
comparing women who were exposed to emotional, physical, and/or sexual IPV during
the year prior to interview to those who were not. We accounted for time-fixed
and time-varying confounders and prior IPV and adjusted standard errors for
repeated measures within individuals. The analysis included 7923 women
interviewed between 2001 and 2013. In the weighted MSMs, women who experienced
any form of prior year IPV were 20% less likely to use condoms at last sex than
women who had not (95% CI: 0.12, 0.26). We did not find evidence that IPV affects
current use of modern contraception (RR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.03); however,
current use of a partner-dependent method was 27% lower among women who reported 
any form of prior-year IPV compared to women who had not (95% CI: 0.20, 0.33).
Women who experienced prior-year IPV were less likely to use condoms and other
forms of contraception that required negotiation with their male partners and
more likely to use contraception that they could hide from their male partners.
Longitudinal studies in Rakai and elsewhere have found that women who experience 
IPV have a higher rate of HIV than women who do not. Our finding that women who
experience IPV are less likely to use condoms may help explain the relation
between IPV and HIV.
