Genome sequences from several blood borne and respiratory viruses have recently
been recovered directly from clinical specimens by variants of a technique known 
as sequence-independent single primer amplification. This and related methods are
increasingly being used to search for the causes of diseases of presumed
infectious aetiology, but for which no agent has yet been found. Other methods
that do not require prior knowledge of the genome sequence of any virus that may 
be present in the patient specimen include whole genome amplification, random PCR
and subtractive hybridisation and differential display. This review considers the
development and application of these techniques.
