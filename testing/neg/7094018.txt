Target cells infected by avian erythroblastosis virus differentiate and become
transformed.

Samarut J, Gazzolo L.

Transformation in vitro of bone marrow cells by avian erythroblastosis virus
(AEV) gives rise to rapidly growing cells of erythroid nature. Target cells of
neoplastic transformation by AEV are recruited among the early progenitors of the
erythroid lineage, the burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E). They express a
brain-related antigen at a high level and an immature antigen at a low level. We 
show that AEV-transformed cells express low levels of the brain antigen and high 
levels of the immature antigen. Their response to specific factors regulating the
erythroid differentiation indicates that they are very sensitive to
erythropoietin. Furthermore, cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant 
of AEV differentiate into hemoglobin-synthesizing cells 4 days after being
shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. All these properties are similar to
those of late progenitors of the erythroid lineage, the colony-forming
units-erythroid (CFU-E). These results indicate that the AEV-transformed cells
are blocked in their differentiation at the CFU-E stage.
