No specific vaccine for West Nile virus (WNV) is currently available for human
use. In the present study, we describe the generation of WNV-like particles
(WNV-LPs) in insect cells by use of recombinant baculoviruses expressing the WNV 
structural proteins prME or CprME. BALB/c mice immunized with purified WNV-LPs
developed WNV-specific antibodies that had potent neutralizing activities. Mice
immunized with prME-like particles (prME-LPs) showed no morbidity or mortality
after challenge with WNV. Immunization with prME-LPs can induce sterilizing
immunity without producing any evidence of viremia or viral RNA in the spleen or 
brain. These results suggest that WNV-LPs hold promise as a vaccine candidate for
WNV infection.
