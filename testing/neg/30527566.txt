BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Treatment with daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV + ASV) for
24 weeks provided a sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of over 90% in
hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV-1b) infected patients without non-structural
5A (NS5A) resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) at the L31 and Y93 sites. In
this study, we investigated whether adding ribavirin to the DCV + ASV combination
could shorten the original treatment regimen to 12 weeks without compromising the
treatment efficacy for HCV-1b patients without NS5A RASs.
METHODS: In the prospective, open-label, single-arm, nationwide multi-center
phase III study, a total of 70 interferon-naïve or interferon-experienced HCV-1b 
patients without baseline L31/Y93 RASs received daclatasvir (60 mg/day) and
asunaprevir (100 mg twice daily) plus weight-based ribavirin (1000-1200 mg/day)
for 12 weeks, with a 12-week post-treatment follow-up. The primary end-point was 
the rate of undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR12).
RESULTS: The SVR12 rate was 97.1% (68/70) and 100% (68/68) in the
full-analysis-set and the per-protocol population, respectively. None of the 68
patients who completed the 12-week treatment experienced relapse during
post-treatment follow-up. Two patients withdrew from the study at treatment days 
21 and 34 due to anorexia and fatigue, which were considered ribavirin-related
and resolved post medication cessation. A total of 4 serious adverse events were 
reported and considered treatment-unrelated. No deaths or grade 4 adverse events 
requiring hospitalization was observed throughout the study.
CONCLUSION: Truncated regimen of DCV + ASV plus ribavirin for 12 weeks was highly
effective and safe in HCV-1b patients without NS5A L31/Y93 RAS.
