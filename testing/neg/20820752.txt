Recognition of pathogenic microbes by the innate immune system is based on the
principle of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These are conserved 
molecular structures that are present in the pathogen but not in the host. Cells 
of the innate immune system or, in some cases, virtually all cells of our body
express receptors that are able to specifically recognize PAMPs and trigger the
appropriate responses including the production of cytokines. In the case of
viruses, an interesting complication exists: Viruses use the host's cellular
metabolism and building blocks to replicate. As a consequence, protein
modifications, lipid or carbohydrate configurations restricted to viruses do not 
exist. Instead, parts of the innate immune system have evolved to detect viral
nucleic acids mainly by virtue of their (non-physiological) localization and
structure. Understanding the molecules involved in anti-viral defence and the
patterns they recognize will allow harnessing them for therapeutic strategies
targeting viral and autoimmune diseases and tumours. This review presents
important recent advances in understanding intracellular recognition of nucleic
acid patterns by the innate immune system.
