AIMS: To investigate the impact of scaling-up opiate substitution therapy (OST)
and high coverage needle and syringe programmes (100%NSP-obtaining more sterile
syringes than you inject) on HCV prevalence among injecting drug users (IDUs).
DESIGN: Hepatitis C virus HCV transmission modelling using U.K. estimates for
effect of OST and 100%NSP on individual risk of HCV infection.
SETTING: Range of chronic HCV prevalent (20/40/60%) settings with no OST/100%NSP,
and U.K. setting with 50% coverage of both OST and 100%NSP.
PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users.
MEASUREMENTS: Decrease in HCV prevalence after 5-20 years due to scale-up of OST 
and 100%NSP to 20/40/60% coverage in no OST/100%NSP settings, or from 50% to
60/70/80% coverage in the U.K. setting.
FINDINGS: For 40% chronic HCV prevalence, scaling-up OST and 100%NSP from 0% to
20% coverage reduces HCV prevalence by 13% after 10 years. This increases to a
24/33% relative reduction at 40/60% coverage. Marginally less impact occurs in
higher prevalence settings over 10 years, but this becomes more pronounced over
time. In the United Kingdom, without current coverage levels of OST and 100%NSP
the chronic HCV prevalence could be 65% instead of 40%. However, increasing OST
and 100%NSP coverage further is unlikely to reduce chronic prevalence to less
than 30% over 10 years unless coverage becomes ≥80%.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up opiate substitution therapy and high coverage needle and 
syringe programmes can reduce hepatitis C prevalence among injecting drug users, 
but reductions can be modest and require long-term sustained intervention
coverage. In high coverage settings, other interventions are needed to further
decrease hepatitis C prevalence. In low coverage settings, sustained scale-up of 
both interventions is needed.
