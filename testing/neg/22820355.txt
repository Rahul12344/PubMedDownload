BACKGROUND: The recent pandemic influenza AH1N1 virus made it clear that planning
for medical disaster response is critical.
OBJECTIVE: To know the responsiveness of a sample of highly specialized hospitals
in Mexico to a medical disaster, with the previous pandemic influenza AH1N1 as
reference.
METHODS: A survey was conducted among the Medical Directors of a sample of highly
specialized hospitals, covering: previous experience with the pandemic influenza,
space considerations, material resources, staff, logistics, and current general
perspectives. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis.
RESULTS: A 95% response was obtained from the institutions (19 hospitals). Of
these, 47.4% considered that the medical institution was not ready to respond to 
pandemic influenza. The median surge capacity for the Intensive Care Unit beds
was 30% (range 0 to 32 beds). The least reserve in medication was found in the
antivirals (26.3%). Only 47.4% considered having enough intensive care nurses and
57.9% enough respiratory technicians; 42.1% would not have an easy access to
resources in an emergency.
CONCLUSIONS: Prevention is key in responsiveness to medical disasters, and
therefore the basic steps for planning strategies must be considered.
