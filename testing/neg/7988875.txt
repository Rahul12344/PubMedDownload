Seven internal, putatively exposed regions of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase
have been explored regarding their tolerance to insertions of large foreign
peptides. Small sequence modifications, including amino acid substitutions and
small deletions, were introduced into the lacZ gene to generate unique BamHI
restriction sites. By using these mutant genes, a 27 amino acid stretch
reproducing the hypervariable loop of foot-and-mouth disease virus VP1 protein
(site A) was further inserted in predefined regions of the enzyme. Among the 13
resulting engineered proteins only three, carrying sequence modifications within 
a short region, are active, with only moderate reduction of their specific
activities. The identified permissive region, which involves amino acids 275 to
279, seems to be a flexible area that could be appropriate to incorporate and
study biological properties of heterologous peptides in correctly folded
beta-galactosidase chimeric proteins.
