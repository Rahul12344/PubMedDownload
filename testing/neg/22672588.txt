BACKGROUND: Understanding the pathogenesis of influenza infection is a key factor
leading to the prevention and control of future outbreaks. Pandemic 2009
Influenza H1N1 infection, although frequently mild, led to a severe and fatal
form of disease in certain cases that make its virulence nature debatable. Much
effort has been made toward explaining the determinants of disease severity;
however, no absolute reason has been established.
RESULTS: This study presents the heterogeneous virulence of clinically similar
strains of pandemic 2009 influenza virus in human alveolar adenocarcinoma cells
and mice. The viruses were obtained from patients who were admitted in a local
hospital in China with a similar course of infection and recovered. The
A/Nanchang/8002/2009 and A/Nanchang/8011/2009 viruses showed efficient
replication and high lethality in mice while infection with A/Nanchang/8008/2009 
was not lethal with impaired viral replication, minimal pathology and modest
proinflammatory activity in lungs. Sequence analysis displayed prominent
differences between polymerase subunits (PB2 and PA) of viral genomes that might 
correlate with their different phenotypic behavior.
CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms that biological heterogeneity, linked with the
extent of viral replication, exists among pandemic H1N1 strains that may serve as
a benchmark for future investigations on influenza pathogenesis.
