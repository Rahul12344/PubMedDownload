Background/Aims: Because of the limited geographic distribution, there have been 
insufficient data regarding hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 in Korea. This
study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and available treatment
outcomes of patients with genotype 6 HCV in Korea.
Methods: From 2004 to 2014, data were collected from Korean patients infected
with genotype 6 HCV in eight hospitals.
Results: Thirty-two patients had genotype 6 HCV. The median age was 44 years, and
6c was the most common subtype. The baseline median alanine transaminase level
was 88 (21 to 1,019) IU/mL, and the HCV RNA level was 1,405,000 (96,500 to
28,844,529) IU/mL. Twenty-five patients were treated with peginterferon (PEG-IFN)
and ribavirin. Three follow-up losses occurred. Additionally, 13 patients
attained a sustained virologic response (SVR), seven patients relapsed, and two
patients exhibited a null response. The SVR rates were 40% and 75% for the 24-
and more than 48-week treatments, respectively, and five of the six patients who 
achieved a rapid virologic response (RVR) attained a SVR.
Conclusions: Korean patients infected with genotype 6 HCV are relatively young,
and 6c is the most common subtype. When treated with PEG-IFN and ribavirin, the
SVR rate was 52%. Similar to other genotypes, a longer duration of treatment and 
attainment of RVR are important for SVR.
