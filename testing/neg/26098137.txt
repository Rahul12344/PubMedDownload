BACKGROUND: In spite of profound reduction in incidence, cervical cancer claims
>275,000 lives annually. Previously we demonstrated efficacy and safety of
radioimmunotherapy directed at HPV16 E6 oncoprotein in experimental cervical
cancer.
MATERIALS & METHODS: We undertook a direct comparison of targeting E7 and E6
oncoproteins with specific (188)Rhenium-labeled monoclonal antibodies in CasKi
subcutaneous xenografts of cervical cancer cells in mice.
RESULTS: The most significant tumor inhibition was seen in
radioimmunotherapy-treated mice, followed by the unlabeled monoclonal antibodies 
to E6 and E7. No hematological toxicity was observed. Immunohistochemistry
suggests that the effect of unlabeled antibodies is C3 complement mediated.
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated for the first time that radioimmunotherapy
directed toward E7 oncoprotein inhibits experimental tumors growth, decreases E7 
expression and may offer a novel approach to cervical cancer therapy.
