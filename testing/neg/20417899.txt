PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Corneal ulcers in cats (ulcerative keratitis) are a common
presenting complaint, and are a frequent sequela to feline herpesvirus (FHV-1)
infection. In fact, it is fair to assume an FHV-1 aetiology until proven
otherwise. In practice, therefore, many cases of corneal ulceration can be
treated medically, but treatment can frequently be challenging, with the need to 
tailor therapy carefully to the type of ulcer, the individual cat and its
temperament.
PATIENT GROUP: All age groups and breeds can suffer with ulcerative keratitis
although some breeds are over-represented for some types of corneal ulceration.
EVIDENCE BASE: The scientific literature on feline ulcerative keratitis is
extensive, particularly that related to FHV-1 infection. This article reviews the
medical treatment options for corneal ulceration in cats with reference to the
current evidence base.
