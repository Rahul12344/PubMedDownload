Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is a key enzyme that mediates the synthesis of
deoxyribonucleotides, the DNA precursors, for DNA synthesis in every living cell.
This enzyme converts ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks
for DNA replication, and repair. Clearly, RNR enzymes have contributed to the
appearance of genetic material that exists today, being essential for the
evolution of all organisms on Earth. The strict control of RNR activity and dNTP 
pool sizes is important, as pool imbalances increase mutation rates, replication 
anomalies, and genome instability. Thus, RNR activity should be finely regulated 
allosterically and at the transcriptional level. In this review we examine the
distribution, the evolution, and the genetic regulation of bacterial RNRs.
Moreover, this enzyme can be considered an ideal target for anti-proliferative
compounds designed to inhibit cell replication in eukaryotic cells (cancer
cells), parasites, viruses, and bacteria.
