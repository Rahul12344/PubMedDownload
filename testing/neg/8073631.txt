cDNA clones corresponding to the mRNA for the hemagglutinin of the
hemagglutination-defective strain AK-1 of measles virus were isolated and
characterized. Compared with the prototype Edmonston strain, 60 nucleotide
substitutions that resulted in 18 amino acid changes were detected. An additional
potential N-linked glycosylation site was added by point mutation, which was
supported by the observation that the hemagglutinin of the AK-1 strain was
stained more heavily after NaDodSO4-PAGE and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining 
than the Edmonston strain. Computer-assisted analysis revealed that three reverse
turns in the secondary structure had disappeared in the hemagglutinin of the AK-1
strain. Moreover, one of these structural changes occurred in the closely
glycosylated region at amino acid residues 168-240, which appeared to be a
biologically important functional domain. The isoelectric point calculated from
the predicted amino acid sequence became about 1 pH unit more basic in the AK-1
strain than the Edmonston strain. This present study is the first sequence
analysis of the hemagglutinin gene in a hemagglutination-defective strain of the 
measles virus.
