Recognition of messenger RNA during translational initiation in Escherichia coli.

Gren EJ.

The structural aspects of recognition by E. coli ribosomes of translational
initiation regions on homologous messenger RNAs have been reviewed. Also
discussed is the location of initiation region on mRNA, its confines, typical
nucleotide sequences responsible for initiation signal, and the influence of RNA 
macrostructure on protein synthesis initiation. Most of the published DNA
nucleotide sequences surrounding the start of various E. coli genes and those of 
its phages have been collected.
