This study aimed to investigate the immune adjuvant effect and mechanism induced 
by chitosan nanoparticles carrying pJME/GM-CSF. In this study, plasmid DNA
(pJME/GM-CSF) was encapsulated in chitosan to prepare chitosan-pJME/GM-CSF
nanoparticles using a complex coacervation process. Immunohistochemistry was used
to detect the type of infiltrating cells at the site of intramuscular injection. 
The phenotype and functional changes of splenic DCs were measured by flow
cytometry after different immunogens were injected intramuscularly. The killing
activity of CTLs was assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release
assay. The preparation of chitosan-pJME/GM-CSF nanoparticles matched the expected
theoretical results. Our results also found that, after pJME/GM-CSF injection,
the incoming cells were a mixture of macrophages, neutrophils, and immature DCs. 
Meanwhile, pJME/GM-CSF increased the expression of MHC class II molecules on
splenic DCs, and enhanced their Ag capture and presentation functions.
Cell-mediated immunity was induced by the vaccine. Furthermore,
chitosan-pJME/GM-CSF nanoparticles outperformed the administration of standard
pJME/GM-CSF in terms of DC recruitment, antigen processing and presentation, and 
vaccine enhancement. These findings reveal that chitosan could be used as
delivery vector for DNA vaccine intramuscular immunizations, and enhance
pJME/GM-CSF-induced cellular immune responses.
