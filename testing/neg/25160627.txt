The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the human immunodeficiency virus,
type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein subunit gp41 is targeted by potent broadly
neutralizing antibodies 2F5, 4E10, and 10E8. These antibodies recognize linear
epitopes and have been suggested to target the fusion intermediate conformation
of gp41 that bridges viral and cellular membranes. Anti-MPER antibodies exert
different degrees of membrane interaction, which is considered to be the limiting
factor for the generation of such antibodies by immunization. Here we
characterize a fusion intermediate conformation of gp41 (gp41(int)-Cys) and show 
that it folds into an elongated ∼ 12-nm-long extended structure based on small
angle x-ray scattering data. Gp41(int)-Cys was covalently linked to liposomes via
its C-terminal cysteine and used as immunogen. The gp41(int)-Cys proteoliposomes 
were administered alone or in prime-boost regimen with trimeric envelope
gp140(CA018) in guinea pigs and elicited high anti-gp41 IgG titers. The sera
interacted with a peptide spanning the MPER region, demonstrated competition with
broadly neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10, and exerted modest lipid binding,
indicating the presence of MPER-specific antibodies. Although the neutralization 
potency generated solely by gp140(CA018) was higher than that induced by
gp41(int)-Cys, the majority of animals immunized with gp41(int)-Cys
proteoliposomes induced modest breadth and potency in neutralizing tier 1
pseudoviruses and replication-competent simian/human immunodeficiency viruses in 
the TZM-bl assay as well as responses against tier 2 HIV-1 in the A3R5
neutralization assay. Our data thus demonstrate that liposomal gp41 MPER
formulation can induce neutralization activity, and the strategy serves to
improve breadth and potency of such antibodies by improved vaccination protocols.
