settlements in Bumba zone, Zaire.

Since monkeypox virus was discovered in animals in 1958 and in man in 1971,
several efforts have been made to identify the reservoir of the virus in nature. 
In July 1985 a study on human environments and animals suspected to maintain
virus transmission was carried out in northern Zaire. The study revealed three
well demarcated areas: the human settlement area, the agricultural area and the
primary tropical rain forest. The first two were found inhabited by terrestrial
and arboreal rodents and bats, while the larger animals have abandoned them. Data
on human morbidity collected in the preceding years suggested that most of the
patients were infected either in the settlement or in the agricultural area.
Isolation of the virus from a squirrel confirmed this suggestion and proved, on
the other hand, that the virus could circulate in an area deprived of the larger 
wild animals, including primates. The virus isolation and results of serologic
testing suggest that out of three groups of animals inhabiting the agricultural
area, the squirrels Funisciurus anerythrus should be considered a priority
candidate to sustain virus transmission.
