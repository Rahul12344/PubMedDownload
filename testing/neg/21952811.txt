Langerhans cells (LCs) are a distinct subset of DCs that resides in the epidermis
and other epithelia. They are potent antigen-presenting cells and strong inducers
of T-cell responses. Like other DC types, LCs express C-type lectins that serve
as antigen/pathogen uptake receptors, with Langerin/CD207 being the
characteristic LC C-type lectin. In this issue of the European Journal of
Immunology, Geijtenbeek and colleagues [Eur. J. Immunol. 2011. 41: 2619-2631]
assign a role to Langerin on human LCs for binding and capturing measles virus.
Interestingly, however, this function does not correlate with productive
infection or with cross-presentation of measles virus. These authors show that
measles virus does not infect the LCs via Langerin, and that LCs cannot
cross-present the virus to CD8(+) T cells; however, presentation of this virus to
CD4(+) T cells occurs and is dependent on virus capture by Langerin. Thus,
cross-presentation of measles virus may be left to skin DCs other than LCs. This 
highlights the complexity of anti-viral T-cell responses that originate in the
skin and also emphasizes the need for intensified investigations into human skin 
DCs in order to be able to ultimately harness their potential for immunotherapy.
