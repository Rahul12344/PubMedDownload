AIM: To assess the clearance rate of human papillomavirus (HPV) after out-patient
treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 122 Nicaraguan women with HPV DNA-positive and
histologically confirmed CIN lesions were included in the study. Fifty-five
patients with CIN1 and 67 with CIN2-3 were treated by cryotherapy and loop
electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), respectively. Follow-up visits were
scheduled at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years. Investigations included
cytology, HPV DNA testing and colposcopy/biopsy if needed. The clearance rate of 
HPV was calculated by multivariate logistic regression. Immediately after
treatment, a pronounced decrease in presence of HPV was observed in both groups, 
with a significantly higher clearance in the LEEP group than in the cryotherapy
group (P = 0.019). Subsequently, clearance continued over time and was similar
between the cryotherapy group and the LEEP group (P = 0.73). Approximately the
same detection rates were obtained for persistence of all HPV types and for
high-risk types separately: 43.9, 37.6, 29.9 and 17.7% in the cryotherapy group
and 24.9, 20.3, 15.3 and 8.4% in the LEEP group at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year and 
2 years, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Out-patient treatment of precancerous lesions of the cervix usually 
results in clearance of HPV. Both LEEP and cryotherapy are highly effective
methods of eradicating HPV. HPV DNA testing may have added value in the follow-up
of patients.
