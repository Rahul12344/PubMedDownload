Water birds are considered the reservoir for avian influenza viruses. We examined
this assumption by sampling and real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing of
939 Asian land birds of 153 species. Influenza A infection was found,
particularly among migratory species. Surveillance programs for monitoring spread
of these viruses need to be redesigned.
