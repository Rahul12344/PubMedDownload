Antibodies to HERV-K antigens have been linked to HIV-1 infection and expression 
of HERV-K proteins generates T-cell cytotoxic responses in many cancers. HERV-K
RNA and protein abundance was measured in HIV-1-infected and control cells. In
vitro exposure of HIV-1 laboratory-adapted and primary isolates on U87MG cells
increased the expression of HERV-K RNA in a dose-dependent manner. HERV-K RNA and
protein burdens were significantly increased in HIV-1-producing H9 cell lines
compared to H9 cells. The expression of HERV-K was synergistically increased in
HIV-1-infected PBMCs after stimulation with PMA/ionomycin. Furthermore, the
expression of HERV-K in PBMCs, and particularly in CD4(+) T cells, was higher in 
HIV-1 patients compared to control subjects. The expression of HERV-K might be
related to HIV-1 pathogenesis and AIDS-associated cancers.
