B cells present idiotopes (Id) from their B cell receptor to Id-specific CD4(+) T
cells. Chronic Id-driven T-B cell collaboration can cause autoimmune disease in
mice. We propose that Id-driven T-B cell collaboration mediates the development
of multiple sclerosis by perpetuating immune responses initiated against
infectious agents. During germinal centre reactions, B cells express a multitude 
of mutated Ids. While most mutations lead to decreased affinity and deletion of
the B cell, some B cells could be rescued by Id-specific T cells. Such
Id-connected T-B cell pairs might initiate inflammatory foci in the central
nervous system. This model may explain the intrathecal synthesis of low-avidity
IgG against viruses, and the synthesis of oligoclonal IgG with unknown
specificity in multiple sclerosis.
