The present investigation was carried out to compare the antigenic relationship
between TRT virus isolates from different countries. The obtained results showed 
that all virus isolates shared similar physiochemical properties. In virus
neutralisation tests marked two way cross reactions between BUT 1 = 8544
(England), STG 761/88 and STG 854/88 (Germany) could be detected. On the other
hand VCO 3 isolate (France) showed only partial reaction. Also the SDS-poly
acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profiles of three TRT viruses (one from
England and two from Germany) were very similar, while the VCO 3 strain from
France showed some variation.
