Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus with devastating
outcomes seen recently in the Americas due to the association of maternal ZIKV
infection with fetal microcephaly and other fetal malformations not previously
associated with flavivirus infections. Here, we have developed the olive baboon
(Papio anubis) as a nonhuman primate (NHP) translational model for the study of
ZIKV pathogenesis and associated disease outcomes to contrast and compare with
humans and other major NHPs, such as macaques. Following subcutaneous inoculation
of adult male and nonpregnant female baboons, viremia was detected at 3 and 4
days postinfection (dpi) with the concordant presentation of a visible rash and
conjunctivitis, similar to human ZIKV infection. Furthermore, virus was detected 
in the mucosa and cerebrospinal fluid. A robust ZIKV-specific IgM and IgG
antibody response was also observed in all the animals. These data show striking 
similarity between humans and the olive baboon following infection with ZIKV,
suggesting our model is a suitable translational NHP model to study ZIKV
pathogenesis and potential therapeutics.IMPORTANCE ZIKV was first identified in
1947 in a sentinel rhesus monkey in Uganda and subsequently spread to Southeast
Asia. Until 2007, only a small number of cases were reported, and ZIKV infection 
was relatively minor until the South Pacific and Brazilian outbreaks, where more 
severe outcomes were reported. Here, we present the baboon as a nonhuman primate 
model for contrast and comparison with other published animal models of ZIKV,
such as the mouse and macaque species. Baboons breed year round and are not
currently a primary nonhuman primate species used in biomedical research, making 
them more readily available for studies other than human immunodeficiency virus
studies, which many macaque species are designated for. This, taken together with
the similarities baboons have with humans, such as immunology, reproduction,
genetics, and size, makes the baboon an attractive NHP model for ZIKV studies in 
comparison to other nonhuman primates.
