Positive test results for acute hepatitis A virus infection among persons with no
recent history of acute hepatitis--United States, 2002-2004.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Hepatitis A is a nationally reportable condition, and the surveillance case
definition includes both clinical criteria and serologic confirmation. State
health departments and CDC have investigated persons with positive serologic
tests for acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (i.e., IgM anti-HAV) whose
illness was not consistent with the clinical criteria of the hepatitis A case
definition. Test results indicating acute HAV infection among persons who do not 
have clinical or epidemiologic features consistent with hepatitis A are a concern
for state and local health departments because of the need to assess whether
contacts need postexposure immunoprophylaxis. This report summarizes results of
three such investigations, which suggested that most of the positive tests did
not represent recent acute HAV infections. To improve the predictive value of a
positive IgM anti-HAV test, clinicians should limit laboratory testing for acute 
HAV infection to persons with clinical findings typical of hepatitis A or to
persons who have been exposed to settings where HAV transmission is suspected.
