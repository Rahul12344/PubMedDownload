Augmented immunogenicity of tumor cell membranes produced by infection with
influenza virus as compared to Moloney sarcoma virus.

Takeichi N, Austin FC, Oikawa T, Boone CW.

The tumor-associated transplantation antigens (TATA) of crude membrane extracts
from SV40-transformed BALB/3T3 tumor cells lytically infected with influenza
virus were markedly more immunogenic than were extracts from uninfected cells
measured either by the ability to induce heightened resistance to tumorgraft
challenge or by heightened lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor cells
in vitro. When intact tumor cells (as opposed to membrane extracts) were
productively infected with Moloney sarcoma virus, they were made so immunogenic
that they would only grow in X-irradiated syngeneic animals. Yet crude membrane
extracts from the Moloney sarcoma virus-infected tumor cells showed no increase
in TATA activity analogous to that seen after infection with influenza virus.
Thus, influenza virus augmentation of tumor membrane TATA may operate by a
different mechanism than does the oncornavirus augmentation of intact tumor cell 
TATA reported by others. It appears that Moloney sarcoma virus and possibly other
oncornaviruses cannot be used to augment the TATA activity of tumor cell
membranes in the same way that other surface-budding viruses can.
