In this study, the immunity level of the southern Greek population in the
1-10-year, 11-20-year, 21-30-year and 31-40-year age groups with regard to Sabin 
vaccine strains and a collection of 11 recombinant and three non-recombinant
poliovirus vaccine strains was determined. The results showed the lowest
neutralization titre in the 21-30-year-age group against poliovirus type 3.
Moreover, the capsid coding region of OPV (oral poliovirus vaccine) derivatives
was sequenced in order to identify mutations that might lead to antigenic
changes. In Sabin-1 derivatives a tendency of accumulation of mutations was
observed in or near antigenic sites while in Sabin-2 and Sabin-3 derivatives in
sites known to be involved in restoring neurovirulence or eliminating their
temperature-sensitive phenotype. It was concluded that the combination of
mutations in the capsid coding region and not the number of specific mutations in
antigenic sites determines the antigenic properties of OPV derivatives and their 
reactivity with human sera.
