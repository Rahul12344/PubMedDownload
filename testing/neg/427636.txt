Prenatal infection following maternal exposure to porcine parvovirus on either
the seventh or fourteenth day of gestation.

Mengeling WL.

Intranasal and oral exposure of two gilts to porcine parvovirus on either the
seventh or 14th day of gestation resulted in prenatal infection. Normal appearing
fetuses and necrotic remnants of what were believed embryos and extraembryonic
membranes were found when the gilts were necropsied seven weeks after exposure.
The presence of masses of porcine parvovirus antigen throughout necrotic tissues 
of six of seven embryos, but not in any of the nine normal appearing fetuses
suggested that embryonic death was due to porcine parvovirus.
