Specific immunological indices have been compared in patients with head and neck 
tumors. It was found that the EBV-specific antibody levels in such patients were 
almost one order of magnitude higher than similar indices in healthy humans. The 
study identified profound changes in the T-cell chain of the immune system which 
is responsible for intercellular interaction regulation and cell killing. Altered
number of lymphocytes and proportion of their main regulatory subpopulations were
founded in cancer patients.
