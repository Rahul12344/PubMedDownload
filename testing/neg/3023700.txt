Effects of S-adenosylhomocysteine and analogs on Epstein-Barr virus-induced
transformation, expression of the Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen, and
methylation of Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

Long WK, Fronko GE, Lindemeyer RG, Wu B, Henderson EE.

S-Adenosylhomocysteine was found to have no effect on Epstein-Barr virus-induced 
transformation of B-lymphocytes and to stimulate viral capsid antigen expression 
only slightly in the FF41-1 cell line. In contrast, the S-adenosylhomocysteine
analogs sinefungin and S-isobutyladenosine inhibited Epstein-Barr virus
transformation and induced a significant increase in the numbers of cells
expressing the viral capsid antigen. An inverse relationship between levels of
viral DNA methylation and gene expression was demonstrated.
