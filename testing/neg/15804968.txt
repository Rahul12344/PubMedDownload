Because morphologic changes in natural rabies are usually relatively mild, it is 
thought that the severe clinical disease with a fatal outcome must be due to
neuronal dysfunction of rabies virus-infected neurons. The precise bases of this 
functional impairment are unknown, and current knowledge on electro-physiological
alterations, effects on ion channels and neurotransmission, and neurotoxicity are
reviewed. Rabies virus may induce neuronal death, possibly through apoptotic
mechanisms. Neuronal apoptosis has been observed in vitro and also in vivo under 
particular experimental conditions. The relevance of neuronal apoptosis in these 
situations to natural rabies has not yet been fully elucidated.
