The concept of using genetic engineering to improve the natural insecticidal
activity of baculoviruses emerged during the 1980s. Both academic and industrial 
laboratories have since invested a great deal of effort to generate genetically
modified (GM) or recombinant baculoviruses with dramatically improved speeds of
kill. Optimal production methodologies and formulations have also been developed,
and the safety and ecology of the recombinant baculoviruses have been thoroughly 
investigated. Unfortunately, the initial excitement that was generated by these
technologies was tempered when industry made a critical decision to not complete 
the registration process of GM baculoviruses for pest insect control. In this
chapter, we summarize the developments in the field from a historical perspective
and provide our opinions as to the current status and future potential of the
technology. We will argue that GM baculoviruses are valuable and viable tools for
pest insect control both alone and in combination with wild-type viruses. We
believe that these highly effective biopesticides still have a bright future in
modern agriculture as public awareness and acceptance of GM organisms, including 
GM baculoviruses, increases.
