Mer+ HeLa S3 tumor cells with high levels of O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) gene expression were transduced by retroviral-mediated
MGMT antisense RNA. The MGMT mRNA, MGMT protein, and MGMT activity in transduced 
cells were only 28.7%, 32.7%, and 39. 1% of that in HeLa S3 cells, respectively. 
The transduced cells showed more sensitive to ACNU than HeLa S3 cells both in
cell survival and in nude mice experiments. Pathologic examination confirmed that
transduced grafts were killed by ACNU. Our results suggested that MGMT gene
expression could be modulated by retroviral-mediated antisense RNA and that Mer+ 
tumor drug resistance to ACNU could be reversed by modulation of MGMT gene
expression.
