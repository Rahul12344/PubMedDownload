The TnphoA transposon constructed by Manoil and Beckwith [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 
USA 82 (1985) 8129-8133] has been modified to permit easy isolation of
single-stranded (ss) DNA of target plasmids. The intergenic region (IG) of
filamentous phage f1, which consists of the phage origin of replication and
packaging signal, was inserted into a nonessential region of TnphoA. This
modified transposon should be useful for the analysis of genes cloned in plasmids
that lack a filamentous phage IG. Transposition of TnphoA-IG into a plasmid
carries the IG with it; subsequently, after infection with a filamentous helper
phage, ss plasmid DNA suitable for sequence analysis and useful for
oligodeoxyribonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis of TnphoA-generated fusions can be 
isolated. The utility of TnphoA-IG was confirmed by analysis of 'blue hops' into 
the bla (encoding beta-lactamase) and pspE (encoding phage shock protein) genes
whose products are secreted into the Escherichia coli periplasm.
