BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a newly
discovered virus found in all forms of KS. In the United States, KSHV infection
appears to be most common amongst individuals at high-risk for KS. Preliminary
data from Africa suggest that KSHV infection may be much more common in the
general population.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the KSHV seroprevalence and age-specific patterns of
infection in an African country with high rates of KS.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional seroprevalence study.
METHODS: Sera were taken for a hospital-based HIV seroprevalence study conducted 
in August 1985 in Lusaka, Zambia at a time when HIV was just becoming epidemic in
this area. A total of 251 sera were randomly sampled and examined for antibodies 
against latent and lytic antigens to KSHV. KSHV seroprevalence was compared with 
demographic and clinical variables using chi2 test for linear trend and odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Overall, 58% of persons aged 14-84 years were KSHV-seropositive. KSHV
seroprevalence increased linearly with age (P = 0.04) and was inversely related
to years of education (P = 0.015). In contrast, HIV infection peaked in those
aged 20-29 years and was positively related to years of education (P = 0.01 5).
No association between KSHV and gender, marital status, or HIV serostatus was
seen.
CONCLUSIONS: KSHV infection was significantly more common in this region of
Zambia in 1985 than it currently is in the United States. Our data are consistent
with KSHV being well-established in this region prior to 1985 and that continued 
adult transmission of the virus was occurring. The high seroprevalence in the
adolescent age-group and the relatively linear increase in prevalence with age
suggest that non-sexual modes of transmission may be important for KSHV
transmission in Africa.
