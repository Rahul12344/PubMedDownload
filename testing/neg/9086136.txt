Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) infect epithelial cells, become localized in
neurons, and can reactivate in response to a variety of stimuli, including
ultraviolet light and hyperthermia. The sequence of gene activation during viral 
replication is known, but the molecular linkage between exogenous stimuli and HSV
reactivation has not been determined. It was hypothesized that interleukin (IL)-6
acts as a signal between exogenous stimuli and neurons, stimulating HSV
reactivation from latency. Mouse corneas were infected with HSV-1, and ocular
reactivation was induced 5-7 weeks later by thermal stress or corneal exposure to
ultraviolet light. Anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies were administered to the
latently infected mice 8-12 h before the reactivation stimulus. Treatment with
anti-IL-6 antibodies resulted in significantly lower frequencies of ocular
reactivation compared with those in mice treated with a control immunoglobulin.
These results support the hypothesis that IL-6 plays a role in HSV reactivation
from latency.
