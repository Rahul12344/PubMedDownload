OBJECTIVES: Recombinant viral vectors based on the nonpathogenic parvovirus,
adeno-associated virus (AAV), have a number of attractive features for gene
therapy, including the ability to transduce non-dividing cells and its long-term 
transgene expression. In this study, an AAV vector containing bacterial
beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) was used to transduce cultured rat vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and rat thoracic aortas ex vivo.
METHODS: VSMC were transduced with AAV-lacZ at multiplicities of infection (MOI) 
ranging from 5.0 x 10(5) to 1.0 x 10(7). Expression of beta-galactosidase
(beta-gal) in VSMC was evaluated by X-gal staining and a beta-gal ELISA method.
Excised rat aortas were incubated with medium containing AAV-lacZ. Expression of 
beta-gal in the aortic segments was evaluated by X-gal staining.
RESULTS: With increasing MOI, up to 50% of cultured VSMC were positive by X-gal
staining and the beta-gal expression increased up to 15 ng/mg protein. The
expression gradually decreased during the culture but was detectable for at least
1 month. In the ex vivo study, AAV vectors transduced endothelial and adventitial
cells in rat aortic segments, while no expression was seen in medial VSMC.
CONCLUSIONS: AAV vectors can efficiently transduce rat VSMC in vitro.
AAV-mediated ex vivo gene transfer into the normal aorta resulted in efficient
gene transfer into endothelial and adventitial cells but not into medial VSMC.
These findings suggest that AAV-based vectors are promising for use in
cardiovascular gene therapy.
