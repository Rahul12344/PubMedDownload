BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study compared the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection in the Republic of Korea and estimated the high-risk regions and towns.
METHODS: National Health Insurance Service data for 8 years from 2005 to 2012
were used. The subjects of the study had visited medical facilities and been
diagnosed with or received treatment for acute or chronic HCV as a primary or
secondary disease according to ICD-10 codes of B17.1 or B18.2, respectively. Any 
patient who received treatment for the same disease multiple times during 1 year 
was counted as one patient in that year. To correct for the effect of the age
structure of the population by year and region, the age-adjusted prevalence was
calculated using the direct method based on the registered population in 2010.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HCV infection among Korean adults (>20 years
old) increased from 0.14% in 2005 to 0.18% in 2012. The sex-, age-, and
region-adjusted prevalence in 2012 was 0.18%. The prevalence was highest in
Busan, Jeonnam, and Gyeongnam, and there were towns with noticeably higher
prevalences within these regions: Jindo (0.97%) in Jeonnam, Namhae (0.90%) in
Gyeongnam, and Seo-gu (0.86%) in Busan.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HCV infection differs by regions as well as towns 
in the Republic of Korea, and is highest in Busan, Jeonnam, and Gyeongnam. The
reasons for the high prevalence in these specific regions should be identified,
since this could help prevent HCV infections in the future. In addition, active
surveillance and treatment policies should be introduced to stop any further
spread of infection in these high-prevalence regions.
