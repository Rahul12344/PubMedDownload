AIM: To investigate the possible association between hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection and angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) in a
population with relatively high prevalence of HBV.
METHODS: Sera from 434 patients who underwent coronary angiography were tested
for HBV antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) and antibodies (Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc and Anti-HBe) 
by ELISA.
RESULTS: Seventy-seven percent (224/291) of the patients with CAD and 73.4%
(105/143) of the patients without angiographic evidence of atherosclerosis were
seropositive for HBV (P > 0.05). However, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were
significantly higher in patients with CAD (P = 0.008), while lower in HBV
seropositive population (P = 0.043 and P = 0.021 after adjustment for
conventional risk factors).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested HBV infection negatively correlates with CRP
levels, but seems not to be associated with coronary atherosclerosis.
