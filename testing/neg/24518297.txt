The "antigen capsid-incorporation" strategy has been developed for
adenovirus-based vaccines in the context of several diseases. Exogenous antigenic
peptides incorporated into the adenovirus capsid structure can induce a robust
and boosted antigen-specific immune response. Recently, we sought to generate a
multivalent adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) vaccine vector by incorporating multiple
epitopes into the major adenovirus capsid protein, hexon. In the present study, a
multivalent recombinant Ad3 vaccine (R1R2A3) was constructed by homologous
recombination, displaying two neutralizing epitopes from enterovirus type 71
(EV71) in hexon. The recombinant virus was confirmed by PCR, immunoblotting, and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and injected into mice to analyze the
epitope-specific humoral response. No differences were found between the viruses 
with two epitopes incorporated into the hypervariable regions (HVR1 and HVR2) of 
hexon and Ad3EGFP, based on thermostability and growth kinetic tests. Both the
epitopes are thought to be exposed on the hexon-modified intact virion surface.
The repeated administration of the modified adenovirus R1R2A3 to BALB/c mice
boosted the humoral immune response against both epitopes. Immunization with
recombinant virus R1R2A3 elicited higher IgG titers and higher neutralization
titers against EV71 in vitro than immunization with the modified adenovirus with 
only one epitope incorporated into HVR1. In this study, the recombinant R1R2A3
virus expressing two exogenous neutralizing epitopes in hexon HVR1 and HVR2
induced specific immune responses to both foreign epitopes. Our study contributes
to a better understanding of hexon-modified Ad vector as a multiple-epitope
delivery vehicle.
