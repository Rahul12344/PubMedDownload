The KRAS/ K-RAS oncogene is crucially involved in human cancer. The term
"oncogene" -- i.e., a gene able to transform a normal cell into a tumor cell -
was introduced in 1969, but the word was not used in the human carcinogenesis
literature until much later. Transforming Kras and Hras oncogenes from the
Kirsten and Harvey sarcoma viruses were not identified until the early 1980s due 
to the complicated structures of the viral genomes. Orthologs of these viral
oncogenes were then found in transforming DNA fragments in human cancers in the
form of mutated versions of the HRAS and KRAS proto-oncogenes. Thus, RAS genes
were the first human oncogenes to be identified. Subsequent studies showed that
mutated KRAS acted as an in vivo oncogenic driver, as indicated by studies of
anti-EGFR therapy for metastatic colorectal cancers. This review addresses the
historical background and experimental studies that led to the discovery of
Kirsten Ras as an oncogene, the role of mutated KRAS in human carcinogenesis, and
recent therapeutic studies of cancer cells with KRAS mutations.
