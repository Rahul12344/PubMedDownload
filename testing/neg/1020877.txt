[The protective properties in mice of tonate virus and two strains of cabassou
virus against neurovirulent everglades Venezuelan encephalitis virus (author's
transl)].

[Article in French]

Digoutte JP, Girault G.

Venezuelan encephalitis virus is a constant menace to man and to animals,
particularly horses. Two as yet unreported strains have been isolated in French
Guyana: Ca An 410d (Tonate) and Ca Ar 508 (Cabassou). They are not neurovirulent 
after peripheral inoculation into adult mice and guinea pigs. Cabassou is not
pathogenic for adult mice after intracerebral inoculation. A third strain, Ca Ar 
19007, is antigenically identical by complement-fixation with Cabassou, but
appears to cross react with other strains, Tonate, when injected
intra-peritoneally or sub-cutaneously, protects adult mice against intra-cerebral
or intra-peritoneal challenge with Everglades virus. The Ca Ar 19007 isolate
causes total protection against Everglades virus if injected intra-peritoneally, 
but only partial protection by the sub-cutaneous route. Cabassou, on the other
hand, if injected intra-peritoneally will protect against intra-cerebral
challenge with Everglades. Tonate and Ca Ar 19007 thus appear to be naturally
occurring attenuated variants of the Venezuelan encephalitis virus complex, which
can protect mice against intra-cerebral infection with neurovirulent strains.
