Detection of antirotavirus immunoglobulins A, G, and M in swine colostrum, milk, 
and feces by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Corthier G, Franz J.

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed to allow direct detection of
class-specific antirotavirus antibodies. In colostrum and in milk, antirotavirus 
antibodies were found in the three immunoglobulin classes. Antirotavirus
immunoglobulins G and M were predominant in colostrum, whereas antirotavirus
immunoglobulin A was predominant in milk and feces.
