Homologs of the transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) and the F-box family member
UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) have been found to promote floral meristem identity
across diverse dicot model systems. The lower eudicot model Aquilegia produces
cymose inflorescences that are independently evolved from the well-studied cymose
models Petunia and tomato. We have previously characterized the expression
pattern of the Aquilegia homolog AqLFY but in the current study, we add
expression data on the two UFO homologs, AqUFO1 and 2, and conduct virus-induced 
gene silencing of all the loci. Down-regulation of AqLFY or AqUFO1 and 2 does not
eliminate floral meristem identity but, instead, causes the transition from
inflorescence to floral identity to become gradual rather than discrete.
Inflorescences in down-regulated plants generate several nodes of bract/sepal
chimeras and, once floral development does commence, flowers initiate several
whorls of sepals before finally producing the wildtype floral whorls. In
addition, silencing of AqUFO1/2 appears to specifically impact petal identity
and/or the initiation of petal and stamen whorls. In general, however, there is
no evidence for an essential role of AqLFY or AqUFO1/2 in transcriptional
activation of the B or C gene homologs. These findings highlight differences
between deeply divergent dicot lineages in the functional conservation of the
floral meristem identity program.
