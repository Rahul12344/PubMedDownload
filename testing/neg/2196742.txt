The gene encoding the specific antigen (S antigen) induced on the surface of
vaccinia virus-infected cells was mapped on the viral genome by the construction 
of recombinant viruses. The S gene is located in the 1.5-kbp XbaI-AccII fragment 
between 11.1 and 12.6 kbp from the right end of the viral genome. Nucleotide
sequencing of the fragment revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 351 codons
capable of producing a polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 40,701 Da.
Mapping of the S mRNA by primer extension indicates the presence of the
transcription initiation site that precedes the translation initiation codon by
14 nucleotides. The region preceding the S mRNA start site is extremely A/T-rich 
and has sequence similarity with other early genes. The signal for termination of
transcription of the early genes, TTTTTAT, is included near the end of the ORF.
The deduced amino acid sequence contains a typical membrane signal characterized 
by a hydrophobic region in the N-terminus. An early polypeptide with a MW of 40
kDa, in agreement with the size predicted from the ORF, was synthesized by
cell-free translation of the mRNA selected by hybridization to a plasmid
containing the region of the ORF.
