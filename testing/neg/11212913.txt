The endogenous Drosophila melanogaster retrovirus gypsy (mdg4) forms virus-like
particles (VLPs) which are found as extracellular particles in the medium used to
culture D. melanogaster cells. The D. hydei somatic cell line DH14, which does
not harbour gypsy sequences, was exposed to D. melanogaster VLPs. Subsequent PCR 
and Southern analysis revealed that gypsy elements had penetrated into the D.
hydei cells, suggesting interspecific transmission of the retrovirus. A D. hydei 
cell line containing gypsy sequences was established and grown in a mixed culture
together with the G418-resistant D. hydei cell line DH33, and gypsy was shown to 
be transmitted from cell to cell. The proportion of cells carrying gypsy
increased with time. The rate of gypsy invasion of the lines DH14 and DH33 was
10(-3) and 10(-2) per cell per generation, respectively. The results demonstrate 
the possibility of interspecific horizontal transfer of gypsy in the form of its 
VLPs.
