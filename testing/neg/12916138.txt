BACKGROUND: Despite recommendations for vaccination against hepatitis B virus
(HBV) of men who have sex with men (MSM), most remain unvaccinated.
GOAL: The goal of this study was to identify attitudes and beliefs associated
with vaccination against HBV among black MSM.
STUDY DESIGN: The Birmingham Vaccine Acceptance Questionnaire was used to collect
data from gay bar patrons.
RESULTS: Of the 143 participants, nearly 42% reported at least one dose of HBV
vaccine. In multivariable analysis, characteristics associated with vaccination
were a decreased perception of barriers to HBV vaccination (odds ratio [OR],
0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.61; P = 0.001); increased perceived
medical severity (OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 2.38-11.96; P = 0.001) and personal severity 
(OR, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.38-3.56; P = 0.006) of HBV infection; and increased
perceived general medical self-efficacy (OR, 9.22; 95% CI, 3.52-24.11; P =
0.0001) and personal self-efficacy (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.14-4.63; P = 0.008) to
complete the three-dose series.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the need to increase vaccination through
innovative approaches to reduce perceived barriers to vaccination while
increasing perceived severity of HBV infection and self-efficacy to complete the 
vaccine series.
