Identification of a human cytomegalovirus virus DNA segment that complements an
adenovirus 5 immediate early mutant.

Spector DJ, Tevethia MJ.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) complements adenovirus mutant dl312, which is
completely defective for expression of the adenovirus immediate early E1a gene
region, for lytic growth (Tevethia and Spector, 1984). This assay defines at
least one HCMV function, activation of the transcription of adenovirus early
genes in trans, that must be provided for dl312 replication in coinfected cells. 
We show here that trans-activation depended on the expression of one or more HCMV
gene. Human embryonic lung cells were transfected with dl312 DNA-protein complex 
and either HCMV DNA or recombinant plasmids containing the adenovirus E1a gene
region or HCMV (Towne strain) DNA fragments. Replication of dl312 occurred only
in cells that received both DPC and either the E1a gene, HCMV DNA, or the XbaI-E 
HCMV DNA fragment (0.68 to 0.77 map units). In addition, we show that HCMV also
complemented adenovirus mutant pm975 for growth in 0.2% serum. Since pm975 grows 
poorly in low concentrations of serum due to a defect in an E1a gene product,
this assay identified a second HCMV E1a-like function.
