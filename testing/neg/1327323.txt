We investigated the intestinal absorption of the macromolecule human
alpha-lactalbumin during and after an episode of acute gastroenteritis in
children. Twenty children were studied in the acute phase and 17 excreted
rotavirus. Eleven children were studied again 5-8 weeks later (convalescent
phase). Human alpha-lactalbumin serum concentrations in the acute phase were
similar but in the convalescent phase they were significantly (p less than 0.001)
higher than those in the reference children. The serum concentrations were also
higher in the convalescent than in the acute phase (p = 0.021). This study
suggests that there is an increased absorption of proteins from the gut into the 
circulation 5-8 weeks after rotavirus gastroenteritis.
