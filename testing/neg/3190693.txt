Primary hepatocyte cultures from duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) infected ducklings
were used to evaluate the antiviral activity of purine and pyrimidine
2',3'-dideoxynucleosides. The purine 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides were very effective
inhibitors of hepadnavirus replication, whereas the pyrimidine dideoxynucleosides
were not. 2',3'-Dideoxyguanosine and 2,6-diaminopurine 2',3'-dideoxyriboside
(ddDAPR) were the most effective antiviral agents studied. ddDAPR given
intramuscularly twice daily at 10 mg/kg rapidly cleared DHBV-DNA from the sera of
persistently infected ducklings but this effect was not permanent.
