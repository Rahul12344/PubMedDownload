BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related cirrhosis is known to
be associated with chronic hepatic inflammation. The present study aimed to
examine the correlation between inflammatory mediators INF-γ, IL-17, and sICAM-1 
in HBV cirrhotic patients.
METHODS: The levels of sICAM-1, interleukin-17, and IFN-γ were measured with
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 120 cirrhotic patients with HBV and 270
sex- and age-matched healthy controls. Total bilirubin (TB) was measured and the 
association between TB and IFN-γ, sICAM-1, interleukin-17 were analyzed. The
levels of these cytokines in serum and the association between IFN-γ and sICAM-1 
as well as interleukin-17 were investigated. Relationships between these
cytokines and Child-Pugh classes were analyzed in patients.
RESULTS: Age and sex were similar, but TB values were significantly different
between the two groups (P<0.001). Serum levels of sICAM-1, interleukin-17, and
IFN-γ were significantly higher in cirrhotic patients with HBV than in controls
(P<0.001 for both). TB levels were positively correlated with IFN-γ,
interleukin-17 and sICAM-1 levels. Significantly positive correlations were also 
found between IFN-γ and interleukin-17 as well as sICAM-1 (r=0.817 and r=0.561,
respectively, P<0.01). There were significant differences between the studied
cytokines (sICAM-1, interleukin-17, and IFN-γ) and Child-Pugh classes (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: The increased IFN-γ level was correlated with both IL-17 and
sICAM-1, and it may primarily play a role as cytokines trigger in liver injury.
Both IL-17 and sICAM-1 may synergistically contribute to liver damage.
