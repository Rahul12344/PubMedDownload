BACKGROUND: Directly administered antiretroviral therapy (DAART) is a promising
intervention for improving HIV outcomes among active drug users, but the elements
associated with successful DAART programs remain largely unknown. This study
aimed to assess the impact of colocated medical, case management, and referral to
substance abuse services (DAART-Plus) among the subjects receiving DAART as part 
of a larger randomized controlled trial comparing DAART with self-administered
therapy.
METHODS: The health services utilization of 72 subjects receiving DAART was
analyzed for its impact on changes in HIV-1 RNA levels at 6 months. The primary
outcome was virologic success, defined as achieving an HIV-1 RNA level </=400
copies/mL or a >/=1.0 log10 reduction in HIV-1 RNA level. A second analysis
consisted of linear regression assessing the effect of covariates on log10 HIV-1 
RNA reduction from baseline to 6 months.
RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, achieving virologic success at 6 months was
associated with high medical services utilization [adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =
10.0 (1.4, 73.9); P = 0.02] and with the use of case management services [AOR =
5.8 (1.1, 30.5); P = 0.04]. Both services resulted in a larger reduction in log10
HIV-1 RNA from baseline (difference in slopes: -0.9 and -1.0, respectively; P =
0.02 for both). Referral to off-site substance abuse services treatment did not
significantly predict either virologic outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals who receive DAART, the utilization of on-site
medical and case management services was independently associated with improved
virologic outcomes. These results suggest the potential utility of integrating
these services into DAART interventions (DAART-Plus) targeting HIV-infected drug 
users with problematic adherence.
