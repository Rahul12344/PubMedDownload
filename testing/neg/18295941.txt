TLR ligands and antigen need to be coencapsulated into the same biodegradable
microsphere for the generation of potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses.

Dendritic cells phagocytose pathogens leading to maturation and
cross-presentation on MHC class I. We found that the efficiency of cross-priming 
in mice after vaccination with biodegradable poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)
microspheres (MSs) was enhanced when ovalbumin was coencapsulated together with
either a CpG oligonucleotide or polyI:C as compared to co-inoculation of
ovalbumin-bearing MS with soluble or separately encapsulated adjuvants. A single 
immunization with MS containing coencaspsulated CpG and ovalbumin yielded 9%
SIINFEKL/H-2K(b) tetramer positive CTLs, production of IFN-gamma, efficient
cytolysis, and protection from vaccinia virus infection. Taken together,
coencapsulation of adjuvant and antigen is an important paradigm for the
generation of potent CTL responses.
