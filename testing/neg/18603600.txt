To probe the mechanisms by which respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in
early life forms an important risk factor for the development of chronic asthma, 
an airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) animal model of guinea-pigs with persistent 
RSV infection was established by intranasal instillation of 2 x 10(5)
plaque-forming units RSV. On days 0, 7, 28, 42 and 60 postinoculation, the RSV
copy numbers, airway function and peptidergic innervation were measured in the
peripheral airways. The results showed that the virus was persistent in the
lungs. During persistent infection (days 42 and 60), the lung resistance and the 
total cells, neutrophils and eosinophils of infected guinea-pigs increased
significantly; the airway showed signs of chronic inflammation; and the substance
P- and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive fibres increased, but vasoactive 
intestinal polypeptide-positive fibres decreased. These results suggest that
persistent RSV infection can cause long-term chronic airway inflammation and
persistent airway neural network abnormality, which may be related to the
occurrence of AHR.
