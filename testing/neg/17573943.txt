AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term effects in
non-responders (NRs) to 48-week interferon (IFN) and ribavirin combination
treatment in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b and high 
baseline viral loads.
METHODS: We measured serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and HCV-RNA levels in
52 consecutive patients infected with HCV genotype 1b and high viral loads who
received combination therapy for 48 weeks.
RESULTS: Sustained virologic response (SVR) was noted in 30 patients (57.7%).
Virologic response (VR), that is serum HCV-RNA negativity by the end of treatment
and positivity during follow-up, was noted in nine patients (17.3%). Thirteen
(25.0%) patients were NRs. Significantly lower serum albumin (P = 0.007) and
ribavirin doses according to body weight (P = 0.021) and higher gamma glutamyl
transpeptidase (GGT,P = 0.038) were noted at baseline in the NR group than in the
SVR and VR groups. ALT normalization rates at six months after the completion of 
treatment were 55.6% (5/9) in VR and 61.5% (8/13) in NRs. Sustained ALT
normalization at two years after the completion of treatment was noted in 55.6%
(5/9) and 58.3% (7/12), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study indicates a high rate of ALT normalization in patients
infected with HCV genotype 1b and high baseline viral loads who received
combination therapy and that such a rate could be maintained after the completion
of therapy, even in NRs. Our results suggest that combination therapy should be
continued in NRs who show ALT normalization in order to prevent potential
hepatocarcinogenesis.
