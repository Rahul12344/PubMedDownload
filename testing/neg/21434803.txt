Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a flavivirus maintained in a zoonotic cycle
and transmitted by the mosquito Culex tritaeniorhynchus, causes epidemics of
encephalitis throughout much of Asia. Resident populations, including short- or
long-term visitors to enzootic regions, are at risk of infection and disease. For
the past several decades, killed viral vaccines prepared in tissue culture or
mouse brain have been used effectively to immunize travelers and residents of
enzootic countries. Cost, efficacy and safety concerns led to the development of 
a live-attenuated virus vaccine (SA14-14-2) and more recently, to the licensure
in the USA, Europe, Canada, and Australia of a purified inactivated, tissue
culture-based Japanese encephalitis vaccine (IXIARO(®), referred to as IC51;
Intercell AG, Vienna, Austria). In addition, a live-attenuated yellow
fever-Japanese encephalitis chimeric vaccine (IMOJEV™, referred to as Japanese
encephalitis-CV; Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France) was recently licensed in Australia
and is under review in Thailand. A broad portfolio of safe and effective Japanese
encephalitis vaccines has become available to meet the needs of at-risk
populations; when appropriately delivered, these new vaccines should greatly
diminish the burden of disease.
