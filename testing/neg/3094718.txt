Willingness of homosexual and bisexual men in London to be screened for human
immunodeficiency virus.

KIE: Two-hundred-seventy homosexual or bisexual men enrolling in the
genitourinary department of London's St. Thomas's Hospital were counseled, given 
written information about AIDS, and then offered screening for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), with the option of being told of the result. Those 
told their results received further counseling, and those testing positive were
offered continued support. Only 5% refused testing, and 70% wished to know the
result. Antibodies to HIV were found in 14% of those tested (17.9% of the
homosexuals and 5.1% of the bisexuals), a lower percentage than reported
elsewhere in London. The authors contend that screening is more widely acceptable
than previously suggested and that it may serve to allay anxiety and promote
behavioral change.
