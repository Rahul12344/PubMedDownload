Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of
vascular injury in Takayasu's arteritis. Both cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and 
natural killer (NK)cells, playing a major part in cell-mediated cytotoxicity, are
thought to kill virus-infected cells or tumor cells with the effector molecules
contained in their cytoplasmic granules, one of which is named pore-forming
protein or perforin. Perforin is expected to play a central role in the granule
exocytosis model of lymphocyte-mediated cytolysis, exhibited by CTLs and NK cells
as well as gamma delta T lymphocytes. We found that perforin was expressed in
these killer lymphocytes infiltrated in the aortic tissue of patients with
Takayasu's arteritis. Immunoelectron microscopic study demonstrated that the
infiltrating cells directly injured vascular cells by releasing perforin
molecules, indicating the critical role of perforin in the vascular injury
involved in Takayasu's arteritis.
