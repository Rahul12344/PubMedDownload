Using DNA heteroduplex tracking assays, we characterized human immunodeficiency
virus type 1 env V4/V5 genetic populations in multiple blood plasma samples
collected over an average of 7 months from 24 chronically infected human
subjects. We observed complex and dynamic V4/V5 genetic populations in most
subjects. Comparisons of V4/V5 and V1/V2 population changes over the course of
the study showed that major shifts in genetic populations frequently occurred in 
one region but not the other, and these observations were independently confirmed
in one subject by single-genome sequencing. These results suggest that the V1/V2 
and V4/V5 regions of env often evolve independently during chronic infection.
