Our previous studies showed that ex vivo transfer of human IL-2 gene into murine 
B16 melanoma cells resulted in the expression of IL-2 activity and had inhibitory
effect on tumor growth in vivo. In this study, B16 melanoma bearing mice were
injected directly with IL-2 recombinant PA317 cells. The in vivo gene transfer
revealed significant reduction of tumor size and prolongation of survival of
tumor bearing mice. Using slot blot analysis, the expression of IL-2 mRNA in
tumor mass was detected and the IFN gamma activity was also enhanced in gene
transferred mice. These results indicated that in vivo direct transfer of IL-2
recombinant retrovirual vector producing cells would induce transfer gene into
tumor cells and exert its antitumor effect.
