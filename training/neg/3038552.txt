surgery.

Thirty-four patients without IgG antibodies against cytomegalovirus (CMV) prior
to open heart surgery were studied. The patients were randomized to receive blood
either from unselected donors, or from donors without detectable CMV antibodies. 
Fresh whole blood was mainly used. Eleven patients received CMV seronegative
blood only. All had an uneventful convalescence period and remained seronegative.
Ten of the 23 patients who received blood from unselected donors had typical CMV 
disease with the onset of symptoms in the third or fourth postoperative week, and
fever lasting for two to three weeks. They all had liver enzyme release and later
seroconversion against CMV. Four patients were hospitalized during this period.
The incidence of symptomatic CMV infection after open heart surgery was higher
than usually reported among the CMV seronegative patients. Selection of blood
donors who lack antibodies against CMV may be an adequate protective measure.
Avoidance of fresh blood and reduced use of blood products are presumably also of
importance.
