The major proteins of the Escherichia coli outer cell-envelope membrane.
Heterogeneity of protein I.

Schmitges CJ, Henning U.

One of the major proteins of the Escherichia coli outer cell envelope membrane,
protein I, can be separated electrophoretically into protein components Ia and
Ib. Strain differences exist regarding presence or absence of component Ib and
this component can selectively be lost by mutation to resistance against a phage.
Both components Ia and Ib are further heterogeneous isoelectrically, and both
together may contain at lease six separable isoelectric species. As judged by
analysis of their cyanogen bromide fragments, Ia and Ib are almost identical
concerning their primary structure; the difference (charge only or size and
charge) was located in a part of the protein that does not correspond to the
C-terminal or N-terminal regions. Components Ia and Ib thus represent essentially
the same polypeptide and they may arise by a modification process in vitro or the
existence of two almost identical genes.
