The waters of 25 large rivers falling into the Baikal Lake, their mouth water
areas and open Baikal Lake areas to a depth of 500 m were for the first time in
the practice of researches on the Baikal Lake were investigated for markers of
hepatitis A virus and rotaviruses. The investigations showed an insignificant
contamination of surface waters with pathogenic viruses. The antigens of all
studied viruses and high values of bacteria from the Escherichia coli group were 
recorded in the areas exposed to chronic man-made pollution. Data on the seasonal
changes in the distribution of enteroviruses indicated their absence in the
annual cycle in the pelagic area of the lake, which suggests that viral particle 
would not accumulate under the conditions of the Baikal Lake over a long period.
