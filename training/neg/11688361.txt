We report a case of widespread immune activation with moderate cytopenia during
acute infection with human parvovirus B19 in an adult female patient, in whom
five criteria for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus were present at
disease onset. Our case is unusual due to the presence of a cutaneous rash
mimicking leukocytoclastic vasculitis at presentation, moderate leukopenia with
thrombocytopenia and the presence of a broad array of autoantibodies. Diagnosis
was established on the grounds of serological tests confirming recent infection
with human parvovirus B19; spontaneous regression of clinical and laboratory
abnormalities was observed within 16 weeks, ruling out classic systemic lupus
erythematosus. We conclude by proposing that human parvovirus B19 infection
should be included in the differential diagnosis of lupus-like syndromes in adult
patients.
