To determine if bovine caliciviruses circulate in France, we studied 456 fecal
samples from diarrheic calves. We found a 20% prevalence of genogroup III
noroviruses and a predominance of genotype III.2. Neboviruses, with a prevalence 
of 7%, were all related to the reference strain Bo/Nebraska/80/US, except for the
strain Bo/DijonA216/06/FR, which could represent a novel genotype.
