The pathogenesis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was characterized by the cell
tropism of the original Oka and attenuated Oka varicella vaccine strains. Among
the tissue cells examined, VZV replicated best in hepatocytes and second best in 
lung fibroblasts. The high affinity to hepatocytes and lung fibroblasts might
correlate with varicella hepatitis and pneumonia and with autopsy observations of
varicella. Cell tropism may be important in understanding the pathogenesis of
VZV.
