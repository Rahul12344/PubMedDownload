Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) belongs to the group of diseases called
Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA). While several triggering conditions are
known, often none is apparent in the individual case. We report a patient
presenting with TTP that was associated with a Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)
infection, with its consequent diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic
implications. Further, our case had individual clinical features that were of
interest within the TTP-HIV subgroup.
