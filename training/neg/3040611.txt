Failure to detect a DNA repair-related defect in the transfection of
ataxia-telangiectasia cells by enzymatically restricted plasmid.

Green MH, Lowe JE.

We have transfected two SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell lines with
plasmids in which double-strand breaks have been introduced by restriction
enzymes, within or near the selected gene. Restriction of pSV2gpt with KpnI, as
previously shown by Cox et al. (1986), reduced the frequency of transfection more
in the ionizing radiation-sensitive ataxia-telangiectasia line AT5BIVA than in
the resistant line MRC5V1. When the related plasmid pSV2neo was restricted with
SmaI, the reduction in transfection was less in the ataxia-telangiectasia than in
the normal cell line. Under our conditions, the apparent defect in transfection
of AT5BIVA by pSV2gpt appears to be a result of the unusual sensitivity of the
repair-deficient recipient to the selective agent. Loss of potential
transfectants is exacerbated when transient gene expression is reduced by
restriction of the plasmid. We suggest that a reduction in yield of transfectants
with restricted plasmid in ataxia-telangiectasia cells cannot readily be used as 
evidence of a defect in DNA repair. Our results are also relevant to standard
transfection experiments, since they emphasize the importance of optimizing
selection when transient expression may be reduced, to ensure that potential
transfectants are not killed by the selection regime.
