Bluetongue virus tubules were purified from Spodoptera frugiperda cells infected 
with a recombinant baculovirus containing the NS1 gene from bluetongue virus
serotype 10, and expressed under control of the Autographa californica nuclear
polyhedrosis virus polyhedrin promoter. These tubules were subjected to a variety
of chemical and physical treatments and the resulting effects on tubule
morphology were examined by electron microscopy. A number of morphological
similarities were noted between bluetongue virus tubules and cellular
microtubules despite a lack of homology between the component proteins at the
primary sequence level. A possible multistranded helical configuration is
proposed for the tubule structure.
