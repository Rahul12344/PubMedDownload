Paradoxical reactions of tuberculosis (TB) in vertebral osteomyelitis are very
rarely reported. We experienced four cases of severe paradoxical reactions in
tuberculous vertebral osteomyelitis. Four cases of tuberculous vertebral
osteomyelitis were confirmed by an acid-fast bacilli smear or culture. The
patients were human immunodeficiency virus negative, and were all initially
treated with isoniazid, ethambutol, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. Their symptoms
improved with anti-TB drugs. However, after 2-12 weeks, their symptoms had
recurred, and spinal magnetic resonance imaging at the time of readmission
revealed an aggravation of vertebral osteomyelitis. Operations were carried out
to relieve severe pain or spinal cord decompression. Through continued anti-TB
drug therapy, all patients recovered without sequelae.
