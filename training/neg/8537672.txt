Disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection is associated with
considerable morbidity and mortality in patients with AIDS. Because both tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) may be
involved in the normal control of MAC infection, these parameters were studied in
AIDS patients with disseminated MAC infection. Of 53 AIDS patients studied, 24
had no clinical events, 11 had disseminated MAC infection, and 18 had other
clinical events. Patients with disseminated MAC infection had significantly
higher serum levels of both TNF-alpha and soluble TNF receptors compared with
other AIDS patients; almost half of the MAC-infected patients had TNF bioactivity
in serum. MAC-infected patients also had severely decreased serum 1,25D levels
compared with all other AIDS patients. The activation of the TNF system was
significantly correlated with the degree of 1,25D deficiency. These findings may 
reflect interaction between vitamin D and the TNF system in the pathophysiology
of disseminated MAC infection in AIDS.
