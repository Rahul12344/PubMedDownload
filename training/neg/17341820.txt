To establish efficient induction of Cre mediated DNA recombination in primary
cells, mouse embryonic fibroblast, keratinocyte, and primary preosteoblast, we
tested various recombinant Cres by fusing of protein transduction domain in human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transactivator of transcription (TAT-PTD) to the N- 
and/or C-terminus. HTC, modified Cre with PTD at the N-terminus, achieved the
highest activity of DNA recombination for those primary cells.
