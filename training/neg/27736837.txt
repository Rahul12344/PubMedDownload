Unmet Needs for Ancillary Services Among Hispanics/Latinos Receiving HIV Medical 
Care - United States, 2013-2014.

The prevalence of diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in
Hispanics/Latinos in the United States is more than twice as high as the
prevalence among non-Hispanic whites (1). Services that support retention in HIV 
medical care and assist with day-to-day living, referred to here as ancillary
services, help persons living with HIV access HIV medical care, adhere to HIV
treatment, and attain HIV viral suppression. The needs for these ancillary
services among Hispanics/Latinos are not well described (2). To obtain nationally
representative estimates of and reasons for unmet needs for such services among
Hispanic/Latino adults receiving outpatient HIV medical care during 2013-2014,
CDC analyzed data from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP). The analysis found
that Hispanics/Latinos in all age and sexual orientation/behavior subgroups
reported substantial unmet needs, including 24% needing dental care, 21% needing 
eye or vision care, 15% needing food and nutrition services, and 9% needing
transportation assistance. Addressing unmet needs for ancillary services among
Hispanics/Latinos living with HIV might help increase access to HIV care, improve
health outcomes, and reduce health disparities.
