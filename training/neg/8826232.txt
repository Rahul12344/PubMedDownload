HIV/AIDS case management: a learning experience for undergraduate nursing
students.

Merrill EB.

Case management has received national and international recognition as a method
for providing comprehensive, coordinated care to clients/families with various
health problems, especially HIV/AIDS. With the increase in clients infected with 
the AIDS virus and the needs of such clients, community health nurses will likely
become their case managers since they usually seek care from the public sector.
Therefore, students receiving learning experiences in community health nursing
will have contact with HIV/AIDS clients and their affected families. Nurses must 
monitor, coordinate, and manage the care of HIV/AIDS clients within
community-based settings. Case management models have been used by community
health nurses who provide care to HIV/AIDS clients. In fact, senior nursing
students in community health nursing at the Coppin State College Helene Fuld
School of Nursing were provided learning experiences with a community health
nurse case manager who had a bachelor's degree. Students had to reassess their
values, beliefs, and attitudes concerning caring for HIV/AIDS clients and their
affected families. Additionally, students used the nursing process and the Levine
Model to provide nursing care to clients. Baccalaureate Nursing Programs must
provide students with learning experiences as case managers of HIV/AIDS
clients/families.
