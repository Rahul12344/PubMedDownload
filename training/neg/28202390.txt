Bone marrow stem and progenitor cells can differentiate into a range of
non-hematopoietic cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-like
cells. In this study, we programmed bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) ex vivo by 
inserting a stable RPE65 transgene using a lentiviral vector. We tested the
efficacy of systemically administered RPE65-programmed BMDCs to prevent visual
loss in the superoxide dismutase 2 knockdown (Sod2 KD) mouse model of age-related
macular degeneration. Here, we present evidence that these RPE65-programmed BMDCs
are recruited to the subretinal space, where they repopulate the RPE layer,
preserve the photoreceptor layer, retain the thickness of the neural retina,
reduce lipofuscin granule formation, and suppress microgliosis. Importantly,
electroretinography and optokinetic response tests confirmed that visual function
was significantly improved. Mice treated with non-modified BMDCs or BMDCs
pre-programmed with LacZ did not exhibit significant improvement in visual
deficit. RPE65-BMDC administration was most effective in early disease, when
visual function and retinal morphology returned to near normal, and less
effective in late-stage disease. This experimental paradigm offers a minimally
invasive cellular therapy that can be given systemically overcoming the need for 
invasive ocular surgery and offering the potential to arrest progression in early
AMD and other RPE-based diseases.
