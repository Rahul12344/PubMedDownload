Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a recently re-emerged public health problem in many 
countries bordering the Indian Ocean and elsewhere. Chikungunya fever is a
relatively self limiting febrile disease, but the consequences of chikungunya
fever can include a long lasting, debilitating arthralgia, and occasional
neurological involvement has been reported. Macrophages have been implicated as
an important cell target of CHIKV with regards to both their role as an immune
mediator, as well evidence pointing to long term viral persistence in these
cells. Microglial cells are the resident brain macrophages, and so this study
sought to define the proteomic changes in a human microglial cell line (CHME-5)
in response to CHIKV infection. GeLC-MS/MS analysis of CHIKV infected and mock
infected cells identified some 1455 individual proteins, of which 90 proteins,
belonging to diverse cellular pathways, were significantly down regulated at a
significance level of p<0.01. Analysis of the protein profile in response to
infection did not support a global inhibition of either normal or IRES-mediated
translation, but was consistent with the targeting of specific cellular pathways 
including those regulating innate antiviral mechanisms.
