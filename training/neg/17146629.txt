Although human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA is detected in the majority of cervical
cancers and their precursors (squamous intraepithelial lesions; SIL), the
persistence or progression of cervical lesions could be associated with
quantitative and functional alterations of dendritic/Langerhans cells (DC/LC). As
LC abnormalities have been associated with a decreased expression of macrophage
inflammatory protein 3alpha (MIP3alpha) in cervical SIL, we tested the effect of 
exogenous MIP3alpha on the migration of LC in a (pre)neoplastic epithelium formed
in vitro. By using a Boyden chamber assay, we first showed that the migratory
capacity of LC generated in vitro is significantly increased in the presence of
MIP3alpha compared to control medium. We next demonstrated that MIP3alpha is able
to increase the 3D infiltration of LC in organotypic cultures of HPV-transformed 
keratinocytes. This property to stimulate LC migration was not altered after
inclusion of MIP3alpha in a bioadhesive polycarbophil gel. Moreover, the function
of DC to exert cytostatic effects and to present alloantigens was not altered in 
the presence of MIP3alpha.
