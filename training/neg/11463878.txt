The ability of transcriptional activation domains (TADs) to signal
ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis suggests an involvement of the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in transcription. To probe this involvement, we
asked how ubiquitylation regulates the activity of a transcription factor
containing the VP16 TAD. We show that the VP16 TAD signals ubiquitylation through
the Met30 ubiquitin-ligase and that Met30 is also required for the VP16 TAD to
activate transcription. The requirement for Met30 in transcription is
circumvented by fusion of ubiquitin to the VP16 activator, demonstrating that
activator ubiquitylation is essential for transcriptional activation. We propose 
that ubiquitylation regulates TAD function by serving as a dual signal for
activation and activator destruction.
