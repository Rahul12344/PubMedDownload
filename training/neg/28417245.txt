A fixed-dose combination tablet comprising the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A
inhibitor elbasvir and the HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir
(elbasvir/grazoprevir; Zepatier™) was recently approved for the treatment of
chronic HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection in the EU and the USA. In phase III
trials, 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with once-daily elbasvir/grazoprevir
(fixed-dose tablet or as individual agents), taken with or without ribavirin,
generally provided high rates of sustained virological response at 12 weeks
(SVR12) in treatment-naive and -experienced adult patients with chronic HCV
genotype 1a, 1b or 4 infection, including those with or without compensated
cirrhosis, HIV co-infection, inherited blood disorders or chronic kidney disease 
or patients receiving opioid agonist therapy or of Japanese origin.
Elbasvir/grazoprevir was generally well tolerated. Thus, elbasvir/grazoprevir,
with or without ribavirin, represents an effective new option for the treatment
of adults with chronic HCV genotype 1 and 4 infection, including a number of
difficult-to-treat populations.
