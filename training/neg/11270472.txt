Parvovirus B19, a non-enveloped single stranded DNA virus is distributed
worldwide. Sero-prevalence in adult populations amounts to approximately 50%.
Clinical manifestations vary depending on the Immune status of the infected
individuals and may include mild childhood Infection as well as hydrops fetalis
due to intrauterine infection. To determine the prevalence of this infection
among the immunocompromized individuals in Thailand, we determined, by indirect
ELISA, levels of IgM and IgG antibodies to the parvovirus B19 in 106
immunocompromized children. These included 49 children who were on chemotherapy
for treatment of malignancies, 18 who were receiving immunosuppressive drugs
after organ transplantations, 14 who were under a regimen of corticosteroids and 
25 who were positive for antibodies to HIV. The average prevalence of IgG
antibodies in 106 children was 16.0%; the prevalence of antibodies was 33.3% in
post-transplanted group, 16% in children positive for HIV, 12.2% in the group
receiving chemotherapy for malignancies and 7.6% in the group treated with
corticosteroids. All children were negative for IgM antibodies to parvovirus B19.
