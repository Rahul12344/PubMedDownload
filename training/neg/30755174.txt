BACKGROUND: Active immunotherapy targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) is a promising
treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous preclinical studies and clinical
trials demonstrated that a safe and effective AD vaccine should induce high
titers of anti-Aβ antibodies while avoiding the activation of T cells specific to
Aβ.
RESULTS: An untagged Aβ1-6 chimeric protein vaccine against AD based on norovirus
(NoV) P particle was expressed in Escherichia coli and obtained by sequential
chromatography. Analysis of protein characteristics showed that the untagged
Aβ1-6 chimeric protein expressed in soluble form exhibited the highest particle
homogeneity, with highest purity and minimal host cell protein (HCP) and residual
DNA content. Importantly, the untagged Aβ1-6 chimeric soluble protein could
induce the strongest Aβ-specific humoral immune responses without activation of
harmful Aβ-specific T cells in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The untagged Aβ1-6 chimeric protein vaccine is safe and highly
immunogenic. Further research will determine the efficacy in cognitive
improvement and disease progression delay.
