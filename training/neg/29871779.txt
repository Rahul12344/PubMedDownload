BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is most important cause of viral
encephalitis worldwide. The pathogenesis of this is probably attributed to the
host genetic makeup. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocytes
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) play a vital role in host defense mechanism
against flavivirus causing encephalitis. We assessed the possible genetic
association between ICAM-1 (K469E) and MCP-1-2518 A > G polymorphisms and
Japanese Encephalitis in North Indian population.
METHODS: We studied ICAM-1(K469E) and MCP-1-2518 A > G polymorphisms with the
help of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) analysis. Expression of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 were determined at mRNA and
protein levels in JE patients and healthy controls by real-time polymerase chain 
reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Homozygous (E/E) genotype of ICAM-1 was associated with clinical
severity (p = 0.015) and outcome (p = 0.04) of JE, whereas, heterozygous (A/G)
genotype of MCP-1-2518 A > G was associated with outcome in JE patients
(p = 0.01). Among severe cases of JE, a higher level of ICAM-1 was observed in
patients with E allele (E/K + E/E) of ICAM-1 (K469E) than non-E allele (K/K). The
level of MCP-1 was found significantly increased in JE patients with homozygous
(G/G) genotype when compared to wild (A/A) genotype of MCP-1-2518 A > G
(p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: ICAM-1 (K469E) and MCP-1-2518 A > G polymorphisms lead to increased
level of ICAM-1 and MCP-1 in Japanese Encephalitis which may be associated with
severity as well as an adverse outcome of the disease. ICAM-1 (K469E)
polymorphism may affect host susceptibility to Japanese encephalitis in North
Indian population.
