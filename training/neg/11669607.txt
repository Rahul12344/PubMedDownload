The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoded latent membrane protein (LMP1) plays a
crucial role in the long-term persistence of this virus within the cells of the
immune system. Not only is this protein critical for the transformation of
resting B cells by EBV, it also displays pleiotropic effects on various cellular 
proteins expressed in the host cell. These include up-regulation of expression of
B cell activation antigens, adhesion molecules and various components of the
antigen processing pathway. Here we discuss how LMP1 acts like an expression
'switch' which, depending on the stage of EBV infection, manoeuvres various
pathways that either modulate the immune system towards or against its survival.
