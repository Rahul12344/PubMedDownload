Public health measures have successfully identified and contained outbreaks of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but concerns
remain over the possibility of future recurrences. Finding a vaccine for this
virus therefore remains a high priority. Here, we show that a DNA vaccine
encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and
neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse
model. Alternative forms of S were analysed by DNA immunization. These expression
vectors induced robust immune responses mediated by CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as
significant antibody titres, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Moreover, antibody responses in mice vaccinated with an expression vector
encoding a form of S that includes its transmembrane domain elicited neutralizing
antibodies. Viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in
the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and
protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism.
Gene-based vaccination for the SARS-CoV elicits effective immune responses that
generate protective immunity in an animal model.
