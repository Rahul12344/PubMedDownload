Drosophila Flamingo is a 7-pass transmembrane cadherin that is necessary for
dendritic patterning and axon guidance. How it works at the molecular level and
whether homologs of Flamingo play similar roles in mammalian neurons or not have 
been unanswered questions. Here, we performed loss-of-function analysis using an 
RNAi system and organotypic brain slice cultures to address the role of a
mammalian Flamingo homolog, Celsr2. Knocking down Celsr2 resulted in prominent
simplification of dendritic arbors of cortical pyramidal neurons and Purkinje
neurons, and this phenotype seemed to be due to branch retraction. Cadherin
domain-mediated homophilic interaction appears to be required for the maintenance
of dendritic branches. Furthermore, expression of various Celsr2 forms elicited
distinct responses that were dependent on an extracellular subregion outside the 
cadherin domains and on a portion within the carboxyl intracellular tail. Based
on these findings, we discuss how Celsr2 may regulate dendritic maintenance and
growth.
