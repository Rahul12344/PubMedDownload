Molecular modeling analysis of the recently published X-ray crystal structure of 
nevirapine bound to wild type human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse
transcriptase (WT-RT) indicated the presence of a lipophilic cavity proximal to
the 4-position of the inhibitor. A series of 4-substituted derivatives of
nevirapine were thus synthesized to assess structure-activity relationships
(SARs) and to see if increased binding to this region might translate into
greater activity against mutant RTs. The results show that compounds with an
appropriately spaced aryl ring appended to the 4-position of the
dipyridodiazepinone ring system show good activity against WT-RT. Furthermore
certain derivatives appear to inhibit the Y181C mutant RT. Attempts to combine
these results with the recent discovery that 2-substituents enhance activity
against the Y181C mutant led to a few compounds with moderate activity against
both enzymes. The SAR of these two positions, however, could not be combined in a
simple fashion.
