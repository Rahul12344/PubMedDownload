There was an increase in severe and fatal influenza cases in Greece during the
2011-2015 post-pandemic period. To investigate causality, we determined
neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor susceptibility and resistance-conferring NA and
hemagglutinin (HA) mutations in circulating influenza type A viruses during the
pandemic (2009-2010) and post-pandemic periods in Greece. One hundred thirty-four
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 95 influenza A(H3N2) viruses submitted to the National
Influenza Reference Laboratory of Southern Greece were tested for susceptibility 
to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Antiviral resistance was assessed by neuraminidase 
sequence analysis, as well as the fluorescence-based 50 % inhibitory
concentration (IC50) method. Five influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (2.2 %) showed
significantly reduced inhibition by oseltamivir (average IC50 300.60nM vs.
1.19nM) by Gaussian kernel density plot analysis. These viruses were isolated
from immunocompromised patients and harbored the H275Y oseltamivir
resistance-conferring NA substitution. All A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were
zanamivir-susceptible, and all A(H3N2) viruses were susceptible to both drugs.
Oseltamivir-resistant viruses did not form a distinct cluster by phylogenetic
analysis. Permissive mutations were detected in immunogenic and non immunogenic
NA regions of both oseltamivir- resistant and susceptible viruses in the
post-pandemic seasons. Several amino acid substitutions in the HA1 domain of the 
HA gene of post-pandemic viruses were identified. This study indicated low
resistance to NAIs among tested influenza viruses. Antiviral resistance emerged
only in immunocompromised patients under long-term oseltamivir treatment.
Sequential sample testing in this vulnerable group of patients is recommended to 
characterise resistance or reinfection and viral evolution.
