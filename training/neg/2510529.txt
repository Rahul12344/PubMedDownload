Ribavirin was evaluated as a potential therapeutic for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic 
fever (CCHF). Viral yields for strains of CCHF virus from Europe, Asia, and
Africa in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells were markedly reduced by this 
drug. Some CCHF viral strains appeared more sensitive than others, but in
general, ribavirin doses as low as 5 micrograms/ml caused a transient reduction
of viral yields. A further reduction in viral yields was induced by a dose of 25 
micrograms/ml, and evidence of viral replication was not demonstrated in cells
treated with 50 or 250 micrograms/ml. In contrast, a dose of ribavirin at least 9
times greater was required to induce a comparable inhibitory effect on the yields
of Rift Valley fever virus, for which the drug has been shown to inhibit
replication in monkeys and rodents.
