Three different fibronectin mRNAs arise by alternative splicing within the coding
region.

We report the isolation of cDNA clones for fibronectin from a rat liver library
prepared in the expression vector, lambda gt11. Restriction mapping and DNA
sequencing of these clones establish the sequence of the C-terminal 35% of rat
fibronectin, covering the cell-, heparin-, and fibrin-binding domains. The cell- 
and heparin-binding regions have homologous repeating sequences. Based on the
sequence data and S1 nuclease mapping, we conclude that there are at least three 
different fibronectin mRNAs in rat liver which differ in coding potential. The
three RNAs appear to arise by alternative splicing within the coding region and
are probably all encoded by a single gene. The implications of these results for 
the structure and function of fibronectin and the differences between various
types of fibronectin are discussed.
