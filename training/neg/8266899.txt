Serologically coronavirus free kittens were placed in 2 catteries with a history 
of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), each cattery representing 1 of the 2
different predominant clinical characteristics of FIP--effusive and
granulomatous. The kittens were clinically observed for 100 days. A 100%
morbidity and a 90% mortality was observed. The first signs were observed after
14 and 27 days respectively. The clinical pattern of the disease was similar in
all kittens and showed a pattern of recurrent periods of conjunctivitis, upper
respiratory and gastrointestinal signs. Once developed, wasting and signs of CNS 
disturbances were consistent. The "effusive strain" had a 2 weeks earlier onset
of signs and death, and a 40% outcome of effusive FIP. Mean survival times during
the observation period were 57 +/- 26 and 57 +/- 16 (mean +/- SD in days),
respectively. The death rates were similar in both groups. Feline coronavirus
(FCoV) antigen was immunohistochemically detected using indirect
immunofluorescence and was present in all kittens and in 93% of the 5
investigated organs (lung, liver, spleen, kidney, and mesenteric lymph node).
