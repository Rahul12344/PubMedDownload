We analyzed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes from lymphoblastoid cell lines
isolated from patients with infectious mononucleosis and from healthy subjects
from California, Hawaii, and Hong Kong between 1970 and 1987. Using genetic
polymorphism as epidemiological markers, we found that several genotypes of EBV
cocirculate in a community and that although most EBV strains isolated from
California and Southern China may be differentiated genotypically, there was no
specific association between genotype and disease or time of isolation.
