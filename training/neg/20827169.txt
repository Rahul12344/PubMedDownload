OBJECTIVE: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected people exhibit a high
incidence of vascular diseases. Since in the general population the high
cardiovascular risk has been associated with an impaired endothelial cell
function, we investigated circulating endothelial progenitor cells in
HIV-positive patients.
DESIGN: We evaluated circulating colony-forming unit-endothelial cell (CFU-EC)
and endothelial colony-forming cell (ECFC) progenitors in 14 antiviral
therapy-naive HIV-positive patients, in comparison with 15 normal controls.
METHODS: CFU-EC and ECFC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals were recovered and evaluated for HIV 
genome presence by PCR. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide like (APOBEC) subunits
expression were evaluated in infected colonies by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: We found that circulating CFU-EC but not ECFC were significantly reduced
in HIV-positive patients and that proviral HIV DNA was detectable only in CFU-EC 
but not in ECFC. Furthermore, the expression of APOBEC subunits was significantly
lower in CFU-EC than in circulating monocytes. Accordingly, the CFU-EC displayed 
a high content of proviral DNA copies, suggesting that these cells have a high
sensitivity to the HIV infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Although HIV does not affect the 'true endothelial progenitor'
compartment, it infects and strongly depletes circulating endothelial progenitors
with hematopoietic signature. We unravel a novel pathogenetic mechanism by which 
HIV infection might cause vascular diseases.
