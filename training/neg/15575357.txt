During the 15 years from January 1984 to December 1998 the Limoges University
Hospital screened 22,859 pregnant patients for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs
Ag) and identified 149 positives. The overall prevalence (0.65%) was intermediate
between prevalences observed among women of French origin (0.29%), French West
Indies islands (5.68%) and of foreign origin particulary South East Asian origin 
(7.14%) and Sub Saharan African origin (6.52%). Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)
replication markers was detected with relative low frequence (HBe Ag: 14.4%;
HBV-DNA: 13.7-20%) among HBs Ag positive mothers. Markers of delta hepatitis
virus was found among 10.5% of the HBs Ag carrier pregnant women. During the 15
years study period variations of the global prevalence were not statistically
significant. Universal prenatal screening and infant immunisation could greatly
contribute to the control of HBV infection if the polemic about the hepatitis B
vaccination recently propagated in France will not have a negative effect on the 
acceptance and national programme of vaccination.
