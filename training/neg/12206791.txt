Gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy will require methods to deliver gene
constructs encoding functional versions of dystrophin to the vast majority of a
patient's musculature. Obstacles to achieving these goals include identifying
which forms of dystrophin would be effective in a clinical setting and developing
gene delivery shuttles capable of carrying and expressing dystrophin cassettes
without toxic or adverse immunologic consequences. We review here recent work
from our laboratory to identify sequences within dystrophin that are required to 
prevent development of dystrophic changes in muscle or which might be able to
correct pre-existing damage. We also describe work aimed at developing viral
shuttle vectors able to carry and express these dystrophin cassettes at high
levels and in a muscle-specific fashion. While great challenges remain in
developing methods for systemic gene delivery, we show that a variety of viral
vectors are able to carry and express therapeutic levels of dystrophin when
delivered directly to mouse skeletal muscle.
