The coding strategies of arenaviruses (family Arenaviridae) and members of the
Phlebovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae differ from those of other negative-sense
RNA viruses in that some proteins are coded in viral-complementary RNA sequences 
and others are coded in the viral RNA sequence. The term ambisense RNA has been
proposed to denote these unique coding arrangements. The implications of the
ambisense RNA coding strategy for the evolution and infection processes of these 
viruses are discussed.
