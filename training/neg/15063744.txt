The auxiliary regulatory protein Vpr of HIV-1 possesses several biological
activities which are believed to facilitate HIV-1 replication and pathogenesis.
In this report, experimental evidence suggests a novel biological activity of
Vpr: facilitation of the turnover of Vpr mutants bearing the L64P mutation. This 
novel activity of Vpr was shared by Vpr molecules from different subtypes of
HIV-1. Co-expression of the wild type Vpr with the VprW54A/L64P mutant resulted
in normal synthesis of the mutant mRNA but enhanced ubiquitination and turnover
of the mutant protein. These results suggest that Vpr may interact with the
ubiquitin/proteasome pathway to regulate the stability of viral or cellular
proteins.
