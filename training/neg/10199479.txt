A case of primary intracerebral Hodgkin's disease (HD) without dural attachment
in a 54-year-old immunocompetent patient is described. The infiltrate was located
superficially in the occipital lobe and corresponded to the histologic type of
nodular sclerosis. A typical immunohistochemical profile (membrane and
cytoplasmic staining with dotlike Golgi enhancement of CD30, moderate cytoplasmic
staining of CD15 in the Golgi area, membrane staining of CD20 of <10% of blastic 
cells, CD45RB negative) and in addition Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane 
protein was detectable in Reed-Sternberg cells. Staging revealed no other organ
sites of involvement. After combined surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and
chemotherapy, there are no signs of recurrence or systemic disease on follow-up
for >1 year. To the authors' best knowledge, an association of EBV with primary
central nervous system HD has not been demonstrated before.
