The human gut flora is currently widely characterised using molecular techniques.
Microbial culturomics (large-scale culture conditions with identification of
colonies using MALDI-TOF or 16S rRNA) is part of the rebirth of bacterial culture
that was initiated by environmental microbiologists for the design of axenic
culture for intracellular bacteria in clinical microbiology. Culturomics was
performed on four stool samples from patients treated with large-scale
antibiotics to assess the diversity of their gut flora in comparison with other
culture-dependent studies. Pyrosequencing of the V6 region was also performed and
was compared with a control group. Gut richness was also estimated by bacterial
counting after microscopic observation. In total, 77 culture conditions were
tested and 32,000 different colonies were generated; 190 bacterial species were
identified, with 9 species that had not been isolated from the human gut before
this study, 7 newly described in humans and 8 completely new species. A dramatic 
reduction in diversity was observed for two of the four stool samples for which
antibiotic treatment was prolonged and uninterrupted. The total number of
bacteria was generally preserved, suggesting that the original population was
replaced but was sustained in size. Discordances between culture and
pyrosequencing biodiversity biomarkers highlight the depth of bias of molecular
studies. Stool samples studied showed a dramatic reduction in bacterial
diversity. Considering the variable antibiotic concentration in the gut, this
reduction in the number of species is possibly linked to the production of
bacteriocin in the upper digestive tract by specific bacteria, such as
Lactobacillus spp.
