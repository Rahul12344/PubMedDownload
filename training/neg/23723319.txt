OBJECTIVES: To compare the immunogenicity and safety of the bivalent human
papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 vaccine between female patients with juvenile
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and healthy female adolescents.
METHODS: 68 patients and 55 healthy girls aged 12-18 years were included in a
prospective controlled observational cohort and were vaccinated at 0, 1 and
6 months. Primary outcomes were immunogenicity expressed as seropositivity rate
after three vaccine doses at 7 and 12 months and HPV-specific geometric mean
antibody concentrations. Secondary outcomes were HPV16/18-specific memory B cell 
responses in a subset of participants and safety, defined as adverse events and
the effect of vaccination on JIA disease activity.
RESULTS: All participants were seropositive for HPV16 and HPV18 at 7 months. One 
patient turned seronegative at 12 months for HPV16/18. No significant differences
were found between patients and controls in HPV-specific antibody concentrations;
however, antibody concentrations were consistently lower in patients. No effect
of methotrexate on HPV16 antibodies (p=0.79) or HPV18 antibodies (p=0.37) was
detected. All patients on anti-TNFα treatment were seropositive after
vaccination. The kinetics of HPV16/18 memory B cell responses was comparable
between patients and controls, but the magnitude of B cell responses at 7 and
12 months appeared lower in patients. No relevant differences in adverse events
were found. HPV vaccination did not aggravate JIA disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The bivalent HPV16/18 vaccine is immunogenic and well tolerated in
JIA patients. However, HPV-specific antibodies and B cell responses tended to be 
lower in patients compared with healthy controls.
