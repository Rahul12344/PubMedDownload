A series of short insertion mutations was introduced into the poliovirus gene for
3Dpol at a number of different locations. When substituted for wild-type
sequences in a full-length, infectious cDNA and tested for infectivity, all 3D
mutants were nonviable. The mutant cDNAs were introduced into a bacterial plasmid
designed to direct the expression of poliovirus 3CD, a viral protein composed of 
contiguous protease and RNA polymerase sequences. Bacteria transformed with these
plasmids all expressed similar amounts of 3CD, and all mutant proteins cleaved
themselves to generate wild-type 3Cpro and mutant 3Dpol polypeptides with
approximately the same efficiency as wild-type 3CD. The released mutant 3Dpol
proteins were all defective in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in vitro.
Uncleaved 3CD is a protease required for processing the viral capsid protein
precursor, P1. In an in vitro assay of P1 cleavage activity, some of the mutant
3CD proteins expressed in Escherichia coli showed normal activity, while others
were clearly inactive. Thus, alterations in the sequence and/or folding of
different regions of the 3D protein have differential effects on its various
activities.
