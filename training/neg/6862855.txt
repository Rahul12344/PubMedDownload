papillomatosis.

Papillae were removed from a 2-yr-old boy with juvenile squamous cell
papillomatosis and the tissue was grown in vitro. The method leading to the
establishment of a continuous laryngeal papilloma cell line is described. This
epithelial cell line was benign, as judged by cell morphology and cellular
inability to form colonies in soft agar or to produce growing nodules in nude
mice. Papilloma virus particles were not seen through the electron microscope. In
the early stages of culture, the cells contained antigen that stained
specifically with autologous serum.
