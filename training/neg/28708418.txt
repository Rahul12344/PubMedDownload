This essay considers the cultural work performed by two public health narratives 
- the DDT narrative and the vaccine narrative - as they appeared in popular and
professional discourse concerning two recent media events: controversy over an
antivaccination film, and the emergence of a Zika global public health emergency.
Like all narratives in the history of medicine, the stories historians and others
tell about DDT and about vaccines organize a shared past to explain the present. 
They also point to a hoped-for future. The DDT and vaccine narratives share
several themes: public health, expertise, evidence, exposure, and power. Their
inclusions and exclusions, however, convey distinct messages about these themes, 
particularly regarding the right conduct of health citizens in the pursuit of
public health. These narratives are analyzed to compare their agendas, and to
propose a case study of how historical work can shed light on contemporary public
health norms, practice, and challenges.
