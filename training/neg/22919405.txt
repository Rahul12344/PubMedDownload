Despite the availability of effective vaccines, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
infections remain a leading cause of encephalitis in many Asian countries. The
virus is transmitted to humans by Culex mosquitoes, and, while the majority of
human infections are asymptomatic, up to 30% of JE cases admitted to hospital die
and 50% of the survivors suffer from neurological sequelae. Microglia are
brain-resident macrophages that play key roles in both the innate and adaptive
immune responses in the CNS and are thus of importance in determining the
pathology of encephalitis as a result of JEV infection.
