More than one hundred naturally occurring variants of adeno-associated virus
(AAV) have been identified, and this library has been further expanded by an
array of techniques for modification of the viral capsid. AAV capsid variants
possess unique antigenic profiles and demonstrate distinct cellular tropisms
driven by differences in receptor binding. AAV capsids can be chemically modified
to alter tropism, can be produced as hybrid vectors that combine the properties
of multiple serotypes, and can carry peptide insertions that introduce novel
receptor-binding activity. Furthermore, directed evolution of shuffled genome
libraries can identify engineered variants with unique properties, and rational
modification of the viral capsid can alter tropism, reduce blockage by
neutralizing antibodies, or enhance transduction efficiency. This large number of
AAV variants and engineered capsids provides a varied toolkit for gene delivery
to the CNS and retina, with specialized vectors available for many applications, 
but selecting a capsid variant from the array of available vectors can be
difficult. This chapter describes the unique properties of a range of AAV
variants and engineered capsids, and provides a guide for selecting the
appropriate vector for specific applications in the CNS and retina.
