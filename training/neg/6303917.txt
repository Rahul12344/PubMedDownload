Acute type A, B, and non-A, non-B hepatitis in a hospital population in London:
clinical and epidemiological features.

Bamber M, Thomas HC, Bannister B, Sherlock S.

The aetiology of acute viral hepatitis in 172 patients admitted to an infectious 
diseases hospital in North London was: hepatitis A in 88 (51%), hepatitis B in 58
(34%), Epstein-Barr (EB) virus in four (2%) and non-A, non-B in 22 (13%). NANB
hepatitis was a milder disease than that associated with the other viruses. It
predominantly occurred in young men (77%). In half of the cases there was
evidence of parenteral transmission. It was not transmitted by sexual contact.
