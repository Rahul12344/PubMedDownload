BACKGROUND: The relationship between silent cerebral infarcts (SCIs) and history 
of parvovirus B19 (B19V) has not been systematically evaluated. As an ancillary
study from the Silent Cerebral Infarct Trial (SIT) (NCT00072761), we tested the
hypothesis that a history of B19V infection is associated with an increased
prevalence of SCIs in children with sickle cell anemia.
PROCEDURE: We used a retrospective cross-sectional cohort study design; each
participant underwent a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and medical
record review for prior B19V infection (n = 958).
RESULTS: SCI was present in 30% (287 of 958) of participants and 17% (165 of 958)
had a history of B19V infection. Based on prior evidence that low baseline
hemoglobin (Hgb) levels are associated with increased odds of SCI, Hgb levels
were divided into tertiles (<7.6 g/dl, ≥7.6-≤8.5 g/dl, ≥8.6 g/dl) and
multivariable analysis was used to determine the relationship between the joint
effect of prior B19V infection, Hgb levels, and SCI. Prior B19V infection and the
lowest Hgb tertile were associated with increased risk of SCI (odds ratio [OR]
2.12; 95% CI, 1.17-3.84; P = 0.013); no prior B19V infection and the highest Hgb 
tertile were associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.38-0.84;
P = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to decrease the incidence of B19V infection, such as the
development of a B19V vaccine, may decrease SCI prevalence.
