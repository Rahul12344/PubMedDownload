OBJECTIVES: Although usually mild, 2009 H1N1 Influenza has caused up to 6000
deaths in the US. To determine outcome in patients with cancer and/or
hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), we reviewed our recent experience at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC).
METHODS: During the initial NYC outbreak (May 19-June 30, 2009), all respiratory 
samples at MSKCC were tested for 2009 H1N1 influenza by DFA, culture, and RT-PCR.
Medical records were reviewed for all cases.
RESULTS: During the 6-week period, 45(11%) of 394 tested patients were diagnosed 
with 2009 H1N1 Influenza. These included 29(17%) of 167 patients with hematologic
conditions compared to 16(7%) of 226 with solid tumors (P < 0.01). 21(22%) of 96 
tested HSCT recipients were positive. Cough (93%) and fever (91%) were common. Of
29 patients who were radiographically assessed, 8(27%) had lower airway disease. 
17(37%) were hospitalized. None required mechanical ventilation. No deaths were
attributed to influenza. All treated patients tolerated antiviral medication.
CONCLUSIONS: 2009 H1N1 Influenza caused mild symptoms in most patients with
cancer and/or HSCT. None died or required mechanical ventilation.
Immunosuppression from cancer or its treatment including HSCT may not be a
substantial risk for poor outcome, however further studies are needed to validate
our results.
