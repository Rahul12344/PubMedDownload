The 2-5A/RNase L pathway belongs to the antiviral system induced by interferon
(IFN). RNase L is an inactive endoribonuclease which is activated by 2'-5'
oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthesized by 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetases. Once
activated, RNase L cleaves mRNA, inhibiting the protein synthesis, as well as 28S
and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), leading to ribosomal inactivation. In this study,
we investigate the role of the RNase L pathway as a cell defence mechanism during
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) replication, and the importance of a 68-kDa protein 
named RNase L inhibitor (RLI), which specifically inhibits RNase L. We
demonstrate that the RNase L and RLI transcripts levels remain constant in
VZV-infected cells for 24 h and 12 h, respectively, after which they decrease
until the end of the viral cycle. VZV does not significantly modulate the protein
level of RNase L during the course of infection. Using an rRNA cleavage assay to 
analyse the RNase L catalytic activity, we demonstrate that VZV replication leads
to a minimal cleavage of rRNA. Moreover, the overexpression of RLI in a
permissive cell line has no significant effect on the VZV replication. We
conclude that RNase L does not constitute a major cell defence mechanism against 
the VZV infection.
