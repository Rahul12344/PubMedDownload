BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Precore (PC) variant (G1896A) and basal core promoter
(BCP) variant (A1762T/G1764A) of HBV are associated with risk of hepatocellular
carcinoma in HBV carriers. However, little is known about their impact on the
adverse outcomes of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative hepatitis and liver
cirrhosis.
METHODS: 251 spontaneous HBeAg seroconverters who had genotype B or C infection
and received a long-term follow-up were enrolled. PC and BCP mutants were
determined qualitatively and quantitatively to correlate with these adverse
outcomes. The findings were validated by an independent case-control study, which
included 184 patients with biopsy-proven liver fibrosis stages.
RESULTS: In the longitudinal cohort study, BCP mutant and possibly PC wild type
were associated with cirrhosis development, but not HBeAg-negative hepatitis.
Multivariable analysis showed that only BCP mutant was an independent risk factor
for cirrhosis development. Using quantitative analysis of BCP mutant, a higher
proportion of BCP mutant, defined as a continuous variable, a dichotomous
variable or an ordinal variable, was associated with a higher risk of cirrhosis. 
If we chose 45% of BCP mutant as the cut-off, the risk of cirrhosis was higher in
patients with BCP mutant â‰¥45% compared to <45% in the longitudinal cohort; this
finding was validated by the case-control study (adjusted OR: 2.81, 95% CI 1.40
to 5.67).
CONCLUSIONS: A higher proportion of BCP mutant increases the risk of liver
cirrhosis development in HBV carriers with genotype B or C infection.
