A simple, nondestructive PCR-based screening method has been developed for
identifying putative transgenic soft white winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)
carrying the coat protein gene of wheat streak mosaic virus. Removal of the
endosperm end of individual seed provided sufficient material for DNA extraction 
and PCR. DNA from seed is more free of the secondary, metabolites found in leaf
tissue that can inhibit both PCR and restriction digests required for Southern
analysis. The half-seed PCR assay has comparable accuracy to the leaf-tissue PCR 
assay and hence can be used as an accurate and rapid method for identifying
transformed lines before planting. Germination of the remaining seed portion
showed germination rates comparable to whole-seed controls. A slight delay in
growth from the first-leaf through the first-tiller stage was observed in the
half-seed-derived plants, as compared to plants grown from whole seed.
