Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four genetically and
serologically related viruses termed DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4. The DENV envelope (E)
protein ectodomain can be divided into three structural domains designated ED1,
ED2 and ED3. The ED3 domain contains DENV type-specific and DENV complex-reactive
antigenic sites. To date, nearly all antigenic studies on the E protein have
focused on DENV-2. In this study, the epitope recognized by a DENV-3
type-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 14A4-8) was mapped to the DENV-3 ED3
domain using a combination of physical and biological techniques. Epitope mapping
revealed that amino acid residues V305, L306, K308, E309, V310, K325, A329, G381 
and I387 were critical for the binding of mAb 14A4-8 and amino acid residues
T303, K307, K386, W389 and R391 were peripheral residues for this epitope. The
location of the mAb 14A4-8 epitope overlaps with the DENV complex-reactive
antigenic site in the DENV-3 ED3 domain.
