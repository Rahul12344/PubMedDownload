An analysis of the accumulated knowledge on virus-based nanoparticles (VNPs)
consisting of virus protein capsids and inorganic cargo, such as nanoparticles
(NPs), nanowires, and thin layers, is presented. Virus capsids (VCs) can serve
either as templates or nanoreactors when inorganic materials are formed outside
or inside VCs. The third possibility is when inorganic NPs nucleate the formation
of VCs. The structural and mechanistic studies of VNP formation are paving the
way to a better understating of virus structure and behavior, and these
facilitate promising applications of VNPs in biomedical and materials research.
