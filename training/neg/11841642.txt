Gianotti-Crosti syndrome (papular acrodermatitis of childhood) is considered a
nonspecific cutaneous host response to a variety of infectious agents,
particularly viruses. Herein we report a case of Gianotti- Crosti syndrome
preceded by oral polio vaccine and followed by varicella infection. The present
case may support the hypothesis of initial immunization and following viral
infection as a possible mechanism for Gianotti-Crosti syndrome.
