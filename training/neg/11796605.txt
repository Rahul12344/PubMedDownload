Oropharyngeal candidiasis is associated with defects in cell-mediated immunity
and is commonly seen in human immunodeficiency virus positive individuals and
AIDS patients. A model for oral candidiasis in T-cell-deficient BALB/c and
CBA/CaH nu/nu mice was established. After inoculation with 10(8) Candida albicans
yeasts, these mice displayed increased levels of oral colonization compared to
euthymic control mice and developed a chronic oropharyngeal infection.
Histopathological examination of nu/nu oral tissues revealed extensive hyphae
penetrating the epithelium, with polymorphonuclear leukocyte microabscess
formation. Adoptive transfer of either naive or immune lymphocytes into
immunodeficient mice resulted in the recovery of these animals from the oral
infection. Reconstitution of immunodeficient mice with naive CD4(+) but not
CD8(+) T cells significantly decreased oral colonization compared to controls.
Interleukin-12 and gamma interferon were detected in the draining lymph nodes of 
immunodeficient mice following reconstitution with naive lymphocytes. This study 
demonstrates the direct requirement for T lymphocytes in recovery from oral
candidiasis and suggests that this is associated with the production of cytokines
by CD4(+) T helper cells.
