Apoptosis has been suggested as one of the major mechanisms of CD4+ T cell
depletion during the course of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Here, we show that
interleukin 7 (IL-7), a nonredundant cytokine that plays essential roles in the
generation and homeostasis of the T cell compartment of the immune system, exerts
strong antiapoptotic effects ex vivo on both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from
HIV-1-infected subjects. The level of IL-7-mediated reduction of apoptosis was
inversely correlated with the number of circulating CD4+ T cells, indicating a
higher sensitivity to IL-7 effects in patients with more advanced disease. The
antiapoptotic effect of IL-7 was uncoupled from the induction of cellular
proliferation or endogenous HIV-1 replication. These results provide a further
rationale for consideration of IL-7 as an agent of immune reconstitution in HIV-1
infection.
