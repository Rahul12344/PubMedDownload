Magnetic separation is a versatile technique used in sample preparation for
diagnostic purpose. For such application, an external magnetic field is applied
to drive the separation of target entity (e.g. bacteria, viruses, parasites and
cancer cells) from a complex raw sample in order to ease the subsequent task(s)
for disease diagnosis. This separation process not only can be achieved via the
utilization of high magnetic field gradient, but also, in most cases, low
magnetic field gradient with magnitude less than 100 T m-1 is equally feasible.
It is the aim of this review paper to summarize the usage of both high gradient
magnetic separation and low gradient magnetic separation (LGMS) techniques in
this area of research. It is noteworthy that effectiveness of the magnetic
separation process not only determines the outcome of a diagnosis but also
directly influences its accuracy as well as sensing time involved. Therefore,
understanding the factors that simultaneously influence the efficiency of both
magnetic separation process and target detection is necessary. Moreover, for
LGMS, there are several important considerations that should be taken into
account in order to ensure its successful implementation. Hence, this review
paper aims to provide an overview to relate all this crucial information by
linking the magnetic separation theory to biomedical diagnostic applications.
