Radiation leukemia virus contains two distinct viral RNAs.

Manteuil-Brutlag S, Liu SL, Kaplan HS.

We have analyzed the RNA genome of RadLV/VL3, a highly oncogenic murine leukemia 
virus. This virus is produced by a permanent cell line derived from a radiation
leukemia virus-induced thymic lymphoma of C57BL/Ka mice. Two distinct RNA
components were found in the virions: a 70S dimer containing two 8 kb RNA
subunits and a 54S dimer containing two 5.6 kb RNAs. A nononcogenic retrovirus,
BL/Ka(B), endogenous in the same strain of mice, contains only 8 kb viral RNA
subunits. The linkages between both RadLV/VL3 dimers have identical thermal
stabilities. Both dimers can serve as primer templates for reverse transcriptase 
and both produce very similar "strong-stop" cDNAs 147 +/- 1 bases long. Sequences
at the 5' end of the 5.6 kb subunit contain the genes for the viral proteins p15 
and p12, but the gene for p30 is either absent or partially deleted. In vitro
translation of the 5.6 kb RNA yields a 100,000 molecular weight protein
containing antigenic determinants which react with antibody to p15 but not with
antibody to p30. In addition, cells producing RadLV/VL3 virus synthesize a novel 
of 1.6 kb poly(A)-containing cytoplasmic RNA which shows very little if any
homology with BL/Ka(B) viral sequences.
