Inhibitor studies of phage T4 wild-type and mutant DNA polymerases. V. A. summary
of kinetic and inhibitor data.

Schroeder C, Jantschak J.

The DNA polymerases of phage T4 wild-type, the mutator mutant L98 and the
antimutator mutant CB121 were purified about 100-fold free of foreign enzyme
activities interfering with the polymerase assay. The enzymes were characterized 
as to thermostability, exonuclease activity and kinetic data with DNA template
primer, deoxythymidine 5' -triphosphate, and a mixture of all four
deoxynucleoside 5' -triphosphates. The effects of eight inhibitors of DNA
synthesis on the three enzymes were determined (Schroeder and Jantschak 1978 and 
1980, Jantschak and Schroeder 1980) and are compared here. The most selective
inhibitor, pyridoxal 5' -phosphate, interacts with the active site of the
polymerases while the two least discriminating drugs, distamycin A and
actinomycin D, do not directly interact with the polymerases at all. The study
was intended to test whether specific enzyme inhibitors elicit a differential
response in temperature-sensitive structural variants of this enzyme and whether,
in principle, structural variants of virus enzymes or the respective ts- mutants 
in vivo are suitable as a screening system for selective antiviral agents.
