A simple, accurate, and precise method to determine adenovirus particle
concentration using 260-nm absorbance was developed as an enhancement to the
method of Maizel et al. (1968, Virology 36, 115-125). This modified method
ensures complete disruption of virus particles and viral DNA prior to absorbance 
measurements, therefore eliminating absorbance measurement errors due to
hyperchromic shift and thus providing an extinction coefficient at 260 nm that is
directly related to protein concentration as measured by the method of Lowry et
al. (1951, J. Biol. Chem. 193, 265-275). Application of this modified method will
reduce interlaboratory variability in determining adenovirus particle
concentrations, as current practices reflected in the literature utilize varying 
sample preparation procedures and calculation methods which cause underestimation
of adenovirus concentration by almost twofold. The sample pretreatment conditions
used in this modified method entail incubation in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate at
100 degrees C for 4 min and result in an adenovirus 260-nm absorptivity of 1.8 x 
10(12) viral particles per milliliter per absorbance unit in a 1-cm-pathlength
cell.
