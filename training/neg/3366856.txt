Loss of normal immune homeostasis occurs in acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS). We evaluated patients at the University of Cincinnati and New York
University Medical Centers for serologic evidence of autoimmune changes.
Specifically, tests for antinuclear and organ-specific antibodies by
immunofluorescence, antisperm and anti-seminal plasma antibodies, rheumatoid
factor by latex and sensitized sheep cell agglutination techniques,
anti-polyadenosine (poly A), and single-stranded DNA antibodies were performed in
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody-positive sera. A parallel study of
mitogen responsiveness was performed and showed inhibition of response by AIDS
and AIDS-related complex (ARC) sera. In spite of evidence of polyclonal B-cell
activation, hyperglobulinemia, and the presence of antibodies to many infectious 
agents, as well as the known cellular immune abnormalities, the patients tested
had a striking absence of these autoantibodies. The only major difference noted
from normal controls, was a low but significant level of antibody binding to poly
A. The autoimmune connective tissue diseases were not observed in this group of
patients.
