Phage plaques and autoplaques in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains.

Pillich J, Kubícková D, Výmola F.

Studies were made on the morphological variety in plaques produced by phage lysis
and autoplaques in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The great variability of phage
plaque morphology may lead to a confusion with the autoplaques produced
spontaneously by P. aeruginosa strains. The production of autoplaques is
characteristic of a large number of clinical strains of P. aeruginosa. The
appearance of autoplaques may complicate analysis of significant clinical strains
of P. aeruginosa.
