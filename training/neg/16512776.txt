Transrenal DNA (Tr-DNA) is a recently discovered class of extracellular urinary
DNA that originates from cells dying throughout the body. Postapoptotic DNA is
known to appear in the circulating plasma, but it is now recognized that a
portion of these fragments cross the kidney barrier and appear in urine in the
form of 150-200-bp fragments. Tr-DNA containing fetal sequences has been isolated
from the urine of pregnant women, tumor-specific mutations have been detected in 
Tr-DNA from patients with colon and pancreatic tumors, and donor DNA has been
found in Tr-DNA isolated from recipient urine. Furthermore, proviral HIV DNA,
bacterial and parasite DNA sequences have been detected in Tr-DNA from infected
patients. Potential applications of Tr-DNA-based tests cover a very broad area of
molecular diagnostics and genetic testing, including prenatal detection of
inherited diseases, tumor diagnostics and therapeutic monitoring and detection of
infectious agents. The Tr-DNA test is expected to have utility in treatment
monitoring, transplantation monitoring, drug development and broad public health 
screening, where a noninvasive, common-platform diagnostic technology has
particular value. This review describes some of the highlights of Tr-DNA
technology applications, advantages over existing technologies and potential
problems anticipated in test development.
