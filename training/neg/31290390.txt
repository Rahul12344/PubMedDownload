BackgroundProgress towards HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) elimination requires local prevalence estimates and linkage to care (LTC)
of undiagnosed or disengaged cases.AimWe aimed to estimate seroprevalence,
factors associated with positive blood-borne virus (BBV) serology and numbers
needed to screen (NNS) to detect a new BBV diagnosis and achieve full LTC from
emergency department (ED) BBV testing.MethodsDuring a 9-month programme in an ED 
in east London, England, testing was offered to adult attendees having a full
blood count (FBC). We estimated factors associated with positive BBV serology
using logistic regression and NNS as the inverse of seroprevalence. Estimates
were weighted to the age, sex and ethnicity of the FBC population.ResultsOf 6,211
FBC patients tested, 217 (3.5%) were positive for at least one BBV. Weighted BBV 
seroprevalence was 4.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9). Adjusted odds
ratios (aOR) of positive BBV serology were elevated among patients that were:
male (aOR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.9-3.9), 40-59 years old (aOR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.7), of
Black British/Black other ethnicity (aOR: 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2-2.8) or had no fixed
address (aOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.5-5.5). NNS to detect a new BBV diagnosis was 154
(95% CI: 103-233) and 135 (95% CI: 93-200) to achieve LTC.ConclusionsThe low NNS 
suggests routine BBV screening in EDs may be worthwhile. Those considering
similar programmes should use our findings to inform their assessments of
anticipated public health benefits.
