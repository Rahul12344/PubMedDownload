Vesicular stomatitis virus matrix protein (VSV M) has been shown to inhibit both 
transcription and nucleocytoplasmic transport. We have isolated a mutant form of 
M, termed M(D), lacking both inhibitory activities. HeLa cells expressing M, but 
not M(D), accumulate polyadenylated RNAs within the nucleus. Concomitantly, a
fraction of M, but not of the M(D) mutant, localizes at the nuclear rim.
Additionally, the nucleoporin Nup98 specifically interacts with M but not with
M(D). In Nup98(-/-) cells, both the levels of M at the nuclear envelope and its
inhibitory effects on host cell-directed expression of reporter genes were
significantly reduced. Together, our data demonstrate that VSV M inhibits host
cell gene expression by targeting a nucleoporin and primarily blocking nuclear
export.
