BACKGROUND: As patients on chronic haemodialysis (PCHD) elicit a weaker response 
to vaccination with recombinant hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), we
conducted this study to see how dialysis efficacy affects response to hepatitis B
virus (HBV) vaccination.
METHODS: Study subjects consisted of 30 PCHD. All subjects were vaccinated with 4
x 40 microg HBsAg i.m. at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. If a subject had an HBsAg
antibody (HBsAb) level <10 IU/l after vaccination, he or she received a booster
dose. Subjects were divided into groups according to the level of HBsAb:
non-responders (<10 IU/l), weak responders (10-100 IU/l), and good responders
(>100 IU/l).
RESULTS: The group of responders had a significantly more efficient dialysis
(Kt/V) than the group of non-responders (p = 0.027). This difference was not
observed between groups of non-responders and weak responders. The group of good 
responders had a significantly better Kt/V than the group of non-responders (p = 
0.012). Good responders had a significantly better Kt/V than weak responders (p =
0.019). Kt/V values showed a significantly positive correlation with the HBsAb
level (r = 0.47; p = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: The HBV vaccination reaction was weaker in PCHD with inefficient
dialysis. Efficient haemodialysis significantly improves the response to
vaccination with recombinant HBsAg.
