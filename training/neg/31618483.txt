Bacteriophage MS2 is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus encapsulated in 
an asymmetric T = 3 pseudo-icosahedral capsid. It infects Escherichia coli
through the F-pilus, in which it binds through a maturation protein incorporated 
into its capsid. Cryogenic electron microscopy has previously shown that its
genome is highly ordered within virions, and that it regulates the assembly
process of the capsid. In this study, we have assembled recombinant MS2 capsids
with non-genomic RNA containing the capsid incorporation sequence, and
investigated the structures formed, revealing that T = 3, T = 4 and mixed capsids
between these two triangulation numbers are generated, and resolving structures
of T = 3 and T = 4 capsids to 4 Å and 6 Å respectively. We conclude that the
basic MS2 capsid can form a mix of T = 3 and T = 4 structures, supporting a role 
for the ordered genome in favouring the formation of functional T = 3 virions.
