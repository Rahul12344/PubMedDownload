The role of the glycans of the mature human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope
(gp160) in its stability in various conditions was studied. gp160 conformation
was monitored through its subsequent ability to bind [125I]CD4. Treatment of
glycosylated (CHO+) gp160 with (i) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) concentrations
above 0.01% impaired subsequent CD4 binding while 0.3% SDS abolished it; (ii)
beta-mercaptoethanol (MSH) concentrations above 0.01% impaired CD4 binding while 
0.03% MSH abolished it; (iii) 2 M guanidine-HCl had no effect; (iv) temperatures 
between 50 degrees C and 80 degrees C altered CD4 binding while, above 80 degrees
C, the binding was abolished; (v) CD4 binding was decreased by 50% by 2
freeze-thaw cycles but was not further affected by subsequent (up to 15) cycles; 
(vi) gp160 incubation in serum or cell lysate had no effect on CD4 binding.
Glycanase treated (CHO-) gp160 binding activity was only 3-fold lower than that
of CHO+ gp160. Only 2 M guanidine-HCl and heating at 70 degrees C differentially 
affected the binding of CHO+ and CHO- gp160, the effects being larger for CHO-
gp160. CHO- gp160 binding was impaired after incubation in either serum or cell
lysate. Thus, glycans stabilize gp160 conformation in some environments. However,
CHO- gp160 appears to be resistant to denaturation as compared to other
glycoproteins reported in the literature.
