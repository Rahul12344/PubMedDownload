To further understanding of the structure and morphology of the Orthohantavirus, 
family Hantaviridae, we have employed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for
three New World hantaviruses: Andes (ANDV), Sin Nombre (SNV), and Black Creek
Canal (BCCV). Building upon our prior cryo-EM and cryo-tomography study of the
Old World hantavirus, Hantaan virus (HTNV), we have expanded our studies to
examine the entire virion population present in cell culture supernatant. Hence, 
in contrast to the prior cryo-EM/ET studies in which we used a polyethylene
precipitation, a sucrose gradient, and a sucrose cushion, we used two sucrose
cushions. We inactivated the material after the first cushion. We tested the
method using HTNV which has a known cryo-EM structure and observed equivalent
results. Therefore, we used this method to assess the particle distribution of
the New World hantaviruses by cryo-EM. Cryo-EM images showed a diverse range of
sizes and morphologies for the New World viruses that we classified as round,
tubular, and irregular. Strikingly, BCCV virions were mostly tubular. These first
cryo-EM images of the New World Orthohantavirus confirm prior EM observations
that noted tubular projections of SNV at the plasma membrane during virion
morphogenesis but were not confirmed. These findings underscore the need for
further investigation of virion morphogenesis of the Orthohantavirus.
