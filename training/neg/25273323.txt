PURPOSE: Both experimental and initial clinical studies have shown the
therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in liver disease.
Noninvasive tracking of MSCs could facilitate its clinical translation. The
purpose of this study was to optimize MSCs delivery dose and route in mice with
acute liver injury using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to track the cells.
PROCEDURES: MSCs were labeled with the Luc2-mKate2 dual-fusion reporter gene
(MSCs-R). The fate of MSCs-R was tracked through in vivo BLI after administration
of different doses or delivery through different routes.
RESULTS: When delivered via the superior mesenteric vein (SMV), the high-dose
(1.0 × 10(6) and 5.0 × 10(5)) group mice demonstrated high liver BLI signal but
also had lethal portal vein embolization (PVE). By contrast, no PVE and its
related death occurred in the low-dose (2.5 × 10(5)) group mice. Thus,
2.5 × 10(5) is the optimal delivery dose. Three delivery routes, i.e., inferior
vena cava (IVC), SMV, and intrahepatic (IH) injection, were also systematically
compared. After IVC infusion, MSCs-R were quickly trapped inside the lungs, and
no detectable homing to the liver and other organs was observed. By IH injection,
lung entrapment was bypassed, but MSCs-R distribution was only localized in the
injection region of the liver. By contrast, after SMV infusion, MSCs-R were
dispersedly distributed and stayed as long as 7-day posttransplantation in the
liver. The in vivo imaging results were further validated by ex vivo imaging,
digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and tissue analysis. Therefore, SMV is the
optimal MSCs delivery route for liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, BLI, which could dynamically and quantitatively track 
cellular location and survival, is useful in determining MSCs transplantation
parameters.
