Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor
and has a dismal prognosis. Measles virus (MV) therapy of GBM is a promising
strategy due to preclinical efficacy, excellent clinical safety, and its ability 
to evoke antitumor pro-inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that combining
anti- programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) blockade and MV therapy can
overcome immunosuppression and enhance immune effector cell responses against
GBM, thus improving therapeutic outcome.
Methods: In vitro assays of MV infection of glioma cells and infected glioma
cells with mouse microglia ± aPD-1 blockade were established to assess damage
associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule production, migration, and
pro-inflammatory effects. C57BL/6 or athymic mice bearing syngeneic orthotopic
GL261 gliomas were treated with MV, aPD-1, and combination treatment. T2*
weighted immune cell-specific MRI and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) 
analysis of treated mouse brains was used to examine adaptive immune responses
following therapy.
Results: In vitro, MV infection induced human GBM cell secretion of DAMP
(high-mobility group protein 1, heat shock protein 90) and upregulated programmed
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). MV infection of GL261 murine glioma cells resulted
in a pro-inflammatory response and increased migration of BV2 microglia. In vivo,
MV+aPD-1 therapy synergistically enhanced survival of C57BL/6 mice bearing
syngeneic orthotopic GL261 gliomas. MRI showed increased inflammatory cell influx
into the brains of mice treated with MV+aPD-1; FACS analysis confirmed increased 
T-cell influx predominantly consisting of activated CD8+ T cells.
Conclusions: This report demonstrates that oncolytic measles virotherapy in
combination with aPD-1 blockade significantly improves survival outcome in a
syngeneic GBM model and supports the potential of clinical/translational
strategies combining MV with αPD-1 therapy in GBM treatment.
