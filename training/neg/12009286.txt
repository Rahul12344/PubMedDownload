A novel class of cationic block copolymers constituted by a neutral hydrophilic
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block and a positively charged
poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block was prepared for delivery of DNA.
These block copolymers spontaneously assemble with DNA to give in aqueous medium 
micellar-like structures. Five of these novel block copolymers (K1-5), differing 
in the length of both the PEG chain and the linear charge density of the
poly(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate block, were prepared and analyzed for gene 
delivery, gene expression and safety. All five block copolymers protected DNA
from DNAse I digestion and delivered the DNA into the cell. However, only three
of them (K1, K2 and K5) released the DNA at level allowing efficient gene
expression into cells. No toxic effects of both the copolymers alone or their DNA
complexes were observed in vitro or in mice. In addition, copolymers were
scarcely immunogenic. These results indicate that this novel class of cationic
block copolymers is safe and possesses the biological characteristics required
for DNA delivery, thus, representing promising vehicles for DNA vaccination.
