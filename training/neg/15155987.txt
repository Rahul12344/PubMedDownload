A total of 451 stool specimens were collected from children less than five years 
of age with acute diarrhea from Ifakara, Tanzania and processed to detect
bacterial enteropathogens, parasites, and rotaviruses. These specimens were
divided into 348 from the dry season and 103 from the rainy season. Overall,
diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (35.7%) were the predominant enteropathogens, with
enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, and enteropathogenic E. coli 
being the most prevalent. Moreover, enteroaggregative E. coli (63% versus 35.5%; 
P < 0.05), Shigella spp. (24% versus 12%; P < 0.05), and rotavirus (23% versus
4%; P < 0.05) were more prevalent in the dry season than in the rainy season and 
enterotoxigenic E. coli (51.6% versus 20%; P < 0.05) and Giardia lamblia (14%
versus 1%; P < 0.05) were more prevalent in the rainy season.
