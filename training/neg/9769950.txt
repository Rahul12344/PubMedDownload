TP53 gene mutations occur in 30 to 55% hepatocellular carcinomas. Both the
frequency and the type of p53 mutations in HCC vary according to geographical
location of tumors. A specific mutation at codon 249 (AGG-->AGT) was found at
high frequency in tumors from high aflatoxin-areas. TP53 mutations in other
geographic locations are less frequent and scattered on the exons encoding the
central region of the protein. TP53 mutations observed in hepatocellular
carcinoma are accompanied by a loss of wild-type p53 function. Moreover, the
p53-249ser mutant appears to display a gain of function at some degree. In
addition to p53 inactivation by gene mutation, there is growing evidence that the
wild-type p53 functions can be inactivated by the HBx protein of Hepatitis B
Virus. The hepatocellular functions of wild-type p53 protein are not entirely
known. The present data suggest that the DNA damaging agents induce p53-dependent
cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in cell lines derived from normal liver or
hepatocellular carcinoma. In contrast, the exposure of mice to genotoxic agents
does not induce p53-dependent changes in normal adult liver. This could be due to
the fact that the hepatocytes of the adult liver are quiescent cells.
