The antigenic structure of hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A (H3N2) viruses was
found to have undergone significant changes which markedly distinguished the new 
isolates of previously occurring strains. Investigations of the epidemic variants
using monospecific and monoclonal antibodies revealed strains with original HA
sites previously unfound in H3N2 viruses. The emergence of the sites with the new
properties determined the epidemic activity of the viruses isolated in this
period.
