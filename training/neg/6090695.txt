pppA2'p5A' blocks vesicular stomatitis virus replication in intact cells.

Alarcon B, Bugany H, Carrasco L.

pppA2'p5'A blocked the production of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus in
HeLa cells. When this compound was present from the beginning of infection, a
selective inhibitory effect was observed in viral protein synthesis. Thus,
cellular translation was not affected even after 10 h of incubation with this
compound, and the bulk of viral proteins was not synthesized. However, this
effect was not observed with ATP, GTP, or the core A2'p5'A. The step blocked by
pppA2'p5'A is located early during virus infection, but adsorption, entry, and
virus uncoating seemed to be unaffected by this compound. Analysis of the
antiviral spectrum of pppA2'p5'A indicated that it is active against poliovirus, 
encephalomyocarditis virus, and Semliki Forest virus and shows no effect against 
herpes simplex virus type 1 and adenovirus type 5.
