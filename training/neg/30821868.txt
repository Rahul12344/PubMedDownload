It is now evident that NK cells kill bacteria, fungi, and parasites in addition
to tumor and virus-infected cells. In addition to a number of recent publications
that have identified the receptors and ligands, and mechanisms of cytotoxicity,
new insights are reflected in the reports from researchers all over the world at 
the 17th Meeting of the Society for Natural Immunity held in San Antonio, TX, USA
from May 28 through June 1, 2018. We will provide an overview of the field and
discuss how the presentations at the meeting might shape our knowledge and future
directions in the field.
