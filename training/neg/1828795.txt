Between 1980 and 1985, over 16,000 immigrants from Ethiopia, a population at high
risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, arrived in Israel. The present study 
was designed to provide epidemiological information necessary for developing
prevention strategies against HBV infection. Among the 144 subjects studied in an
absorption center in Israel, only 32% had no detectable HBV markers and were
therefore susceptible to infection. The prevalence rate of HBsAg was 19% compared
with 42% for anti-HBs and 7.6% for anti-HBc alone. The percentage of subjects
with no HBV marker decreased sharply with age, and there was similarly an
age-linked increase in anti-HBs, indicating the importance of horizontal
transmission in HBV infection. The distribution of HBV markers was similar in
both sexes. Evidence of mild liver disease was found in only three subjects. All 
newborns and new arrivals less than 2 years of age in the Ethiopian community are
vaccinated against HBV infection to prevent vertical and early horizontal
transmission. The data obtained in our study suggest that this means of
prevention of HBV infection is insufficient. We suggest that the vaccination of
all children aged 2-7 without prevaccination screening, and the vaccination of
children aged 8-18 found to be susceptible on anti-HBc screening, would
substantially lower HBV transmission in this community.
