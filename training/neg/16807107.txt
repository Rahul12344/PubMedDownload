Is there a "conspiracy" at work among viral pathogens? Apparently, yes. Rabies
virus, lenti- and retroviruses, and herpesviruses, the "co-conspirators", target 
select members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily to invade 
the cells of their host. The intrigue deepens, as several reports have revealed
that the viral envelope proteins interact with the cellular TNF receptor in a
highly conserved region of previously unknown function. Targeting of this region 
by diverse pathogens suggests that a selective advantage is acquired. This
advantage might involve regulation of the immune response, because recent
investigations of the herpesvirus entry receptor demonstrated that this conserved
region engages an inhibitory co-receptor governing T-cell activation.
