OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and envelope (HBeAg) antigen loss are the 
primary goals of treating chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). Although their
quantification is useful for other antivirals, such has not been the case with
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), particularly in HIV infection.
DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, cohort study in 143 antiretroviral-experienced 
HIV-HBV-co-infected patients initiating TDF.
METHODS: HBsAg (IU/ml) and HBeAg levels (S/CO) were measured every 6 months.
HBsAg and HBeAg decline (Δ) were assessed by mixed-effect linear models.
Quantification criteria were used to assess predictability of antigen loss with
time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 30.3 months, cumulative incidence rate of
HBsAg loss was 4.0% (n = 4) in the entire study population and HBeAg loss was
21.0% (n = 17) in the 96 HBeAg-positive patients. ΔHBsAg was steady during
follow-up (HBeAg-positive: -0.027; HBeAg-negative: -0.017 log(10) IU/ml per
month), whereas ΔHBeAg ratio was strongly biphasic (-27.1 S/CO per month before
and -6.5 S/CO per month after 18 months). Baseline HBeAg and ΔHBeAg were
significantly different in patients harboring precore mutations (P < 0.01),
whereas both ΔHBsAg and ΔHBeAg were significantly slower among HBeAg-positive
patients with CD4(+) T-cell count less than 350 cells/μl (P < 0.05). HBeAg-ratio 
of 10 S/CO or less at 12 months of therapy was the optimal marker of HBeAg loss, 
with high sensitivity (0.82) and specificity (0.84) at 36 months. In patients
with HBsAg loss, three of four (75.0%) patients had a baseline level of HBsAg of 
400 IU/ml or less.
CONCLUSION: During TDF treatment, HIV-induced immunosuppression and HBV genetic
variability are associated with differences in HBsAg and HBeAg decline among
antiretroviral-experienced, co-infected patients. Considering the decline of
HBsAg level is slow, further evaluation is needed to determine its role as a
marker of therapeutic efficacy.
