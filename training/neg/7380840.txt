Ontogeny of pituitary hormone mRNAs in the bovine fetus. Quantitation of
pre-prolactin mRNA as a function of gestation.

The mRNA coding for pre-prolactin (pPRL) of the adult bovine anterior pituitary
was purified to 85% homogeneity and used as a template for cDNA synthesis with
reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus. The cDNA sequences
complementary to pPRL mRNA were further purified by employing a limited
back-hybridization step and treatment with S1 nuclease. The pPRL cDNA preparation
was judged to be homogeneous by comparing its hybridization kinetics to those of 
ovalbumin and globin mRNA standards and by thermal melt analysis of the pPRL
mRNA:cDNA hybrids. Total cellular RNA was extracted from individual bovine fetal 
pituitaries of either sex, ranging from 90 to 200 days of gestation, and examined
for its pPRL mRNA concentration by hybridization with an excess of pPRL cDNA. The
hybridization assay was capable of detecting picogram amounts of pPRL mRNA, e.g. 
amounts less than 0.002% of input total cellular RNA. These results indicated
that from 90 to 200 days of gestation, the levels of pPRL mRNA relative to total 
cellular RNA in bovine fetal pituitaries increase exponentially. This increase in
pPRL mRNA occurs to the same extent in either sex, with the most dramatic shift
(over 10-fold) occurring between 120 and 145 days of gestation.
