OBJECTIVE: To reveal a possible impairment of the plasminogen activator system in
the pulmonary infections of AIDS patients.
DESIGN: To test the plasminogen activator system functionality in alveolar
macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in control subjects and AIDS 
patients. Procedures were designed to detect the presence of imbalance in
plasminogen activator activity and to ascertain if this imbalance is due to a
direct effect of the HIV virus on macrophages or to superimposed opportunistic
infection.
METHODS: Alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were
either lysed with Triton X-100 or cultured for 24 h. Plasminogen activators and
plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI) were measured by chromogenic substrate
assay and binding to 125I-urokinase followed by 10% sodium dodecyl-sulphate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), respectively.
RESULTS: Plasminogen activator activity in BALF and in alveolar macrophages from 
AIDS patients was decreased. This reduction was independent of the presence of an
infectious pulmonary process. In contrast, free PAI was increased in AIDS
patients with Pneumocystis carinii infection. This increase is possibly caused by
a different glycosylated form of PAI-2.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the view that the pulmonary fibrogenic response is 
in part secondary to an imbalance within the plasminogen activator system and
provide the basis for clarifying the role of these alterations in the
pathophysiology of AIDS-related pulmonary infections.
