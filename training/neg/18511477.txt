In Kenya, HIV diagnosis is not routinely carried out in infants, and yet rapid
diagnosis could improve access to lifesaving interventions. A cheap and readily
accessible service can resolve this problem, if feasible. In this pilot study the
feasibility and costs of provision of an infant HIV diagnosis service in Kenya
are evaluated. Dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from infants exposed to
HIV, sent to a central testing laboratory and tested using the Roche Amplicor v. 
1.5 DNA PCR kit. The results were then dispatched to health facilities within a
week. A total of 15.4% of the samples tested HIV+ despite the widespread access
to prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programs in Kenya. The cost
per test at 21.50 USD is prohibitive and will limit access to diagnosis. It
remains to be seen whether the increase in testing will immediately lead to an
increase in access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) services for infants.
