The authors report a case of cervicobrachial radiculoplexopathy with proximal
conduction block (CB), associated with acute Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. 
The patient presented with pain, paresthesias, and monomelic weakness in the left
C7-8, and T1 myotomes. The illness was monophasic with rapid recovery.
Neurophysiologic studies demonstrated CB in the proximal left median and ulnar
nerve segments. The authors conclude that this syndrome resulted from a
postinfectious process following acute EBV infection.
