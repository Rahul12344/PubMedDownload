Natalizumab (Tysabri, Biogen Idec and Elan Pharmaceuticals) is a monoclonal
antibody approved for use in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) as
well as moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We report the first case of a patient
with a history of MS, on monthly natalizumab, who developed HSV-2 meningitis. We 
discuss the mechanism of action of natalizumab and review what is known about the
reactivation of herpes infection in association with this medication. The
question of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV)
prophylaxis for patients is raised.
