Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major causative pathogen associated with liver
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The virus has a positive-sense RNA genome
encoding a single polyprotein with the virion components located in the
N-terminal portion. During biosynthesis of the polyprotein, an internal signal
sequence between the core protein and the envelope protein E1 targets the nascent
polypeptide to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane for translocation of E1
into the ER. Following membrane insertion, the signal sequence is cleaved from E1
by signal peptidase. Here we provide evidence that after cleavage by signal
peptidase, the signal peptide is further processed by the intramembrane-cleaving 
protease SPP that promotes the release of core protein from the ER membrane. Core
protein is then free for subsequent trafficking to lipid droplets. This study
represents an example of a potential role for intramembrane proteolysis in the
maturation of a viral protein.
