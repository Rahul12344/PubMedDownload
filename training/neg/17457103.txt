Molecular characterization of C2-V5 envelope sequences from maternal plasma,
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), cervical secretions and infant PBMC
was performed in eight CRF01_AE-infected mother/infant pairs. Maternal viruses
were relatively homogeneous within a compartment but distinct in different
compartments in mothers with high CD4 cell counts. Infant viruses were almost
distinct, but phylogenetically related, to maternal viruses, mostly from the
maternal PBMC compartment, reflecting the frequent transmission of HIV-1 from
maternal cells rather than free viruses.
