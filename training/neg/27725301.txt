OBJECTIVES/BACKGROUND: Sequence variants in HPV16 confer differences in oncogenic
potential; however, to date there have not been any HPV sequence studies
performed in Nepal. The objective of this study was to characterize HPV16 viral
genome sequences from Nepal compared to a reference sequence in order to
determine their lineages. Additionally, we sought to determine if five High-grade
Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (HSIL) subjects were genetically distinct from
the non-HSIL subjects.
METHODS: DNA was isolated from exfoliated cervical cells from 17 individuals in
Nepal who were previously identified to be HPV16-positive. A custom HPV16 Ion
Ampliseq panel of multiplexed degenerate primers was designed that generated 47
overlapping amplicons and covered 99% of the viral genome for all known HPV16
variant lineages. All sequence data were processed through a custom quality
control and analysis pipeline of sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: There were high similarities across the genomes, with two major indels
observed in the non-coding region between E5 and L2. Compared to the PAVE
reference HPV16 genome, there were up to 9, 4, 38, 27, 8, 7, 52, and 32
nucleotide variants in the E6, E7, E1, E2, E4, E5, L2, and L1 genes in the
Nepalese samples, respectively. Based on sequence variation, HPV16 from Nepal
falls across the A, C, and D lineages in this study. We found no evidence of
genetic distinctness between HSIL and non-HSIL subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The evolutionary and pathological characteristics of the
representative HPV16 genomes from Nepal seem similar to results from other parts 
of the world and provide the basis for further studies.
