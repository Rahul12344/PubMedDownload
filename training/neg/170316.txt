Design and construction of an apparatus for the growth of micro cell cultures on 
standard glass microscope slides and its application for screening large numbers 
of sera by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique.

Lawman MJ, Caie IS.

A simple stainless-steel apparatus was designed to contain standard microscope
slides on which were grown micro cell cultures in the form of 16 individual
monolayers per slide. The application of this apparatus for the screening of
serum samples by fluorescent antibody techniques is described.
