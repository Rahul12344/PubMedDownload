A cross-sectional study was conducted of 500 human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)-infected adults frequency matched on age, sex, and community to 500
HIV-uninfected individuals in the Rakai District, Uganda to evaluate
seroprevalence of anti-hepatitis E virus (HEV) IgG antibodies. HEV seroprevalence
was 47%, and 1 HIV-infected individual was actively infected with a genotype 3
virus. Using modified Poisson regression, male sex (prevalence ratios [PR] =
1.247; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.071-1.450) and chronic hepatitis B virus
infection (PR = 1.377; 95% CI, 1.090-1.738) were associated with HEV
seroprevalence. HIV infection status (PR = 0.973; 95% CI, 0.852-1.111) was not
associated with HEV seroprevalence. These data suggest there is a large burden of
prior exposure to HEV in rural Uganda.
