To elucidate the role of the ribose moiety in substrate binding, various ATP
derivatives modified in ribose moiety were studied as probes for the T4 RNA
ligase first stage reaction. The kinetic parameters for competitive inhibition
were determined. Inhibition experiments using substrate analogs demonstrated that
the major binding determinants of ATP analogs were purine and triphosphate
moieties of ATP; modification of the ribose moiety was not critical. Adenosine
triphosphates attached to agarose were used as affinity adsorbent for
purification of T4 RNA ligase. These derivatives had been successfully used in
reversible binding of the enzyme. Best results were achieved with agarose coupled
via N6 of the purine moiety of ATP.
