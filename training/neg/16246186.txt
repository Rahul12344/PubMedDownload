BACKGROUND AND AIM: Many individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms do not seek
medical attention and so there is little known about the pathogens involved in
most cases of community gastroenteritis. We aimed to identify the pathogens
responsible for community gastroenteritis and to examine the associated symptoms.
METHODS: In a prospective study of 2811 subjects over 15 months, fecal pathogens 
were examined following highly credible gastroenteritis (HCG) events. The
population consisted of family units of at least two children (< or =15
years-old) and two adults each. Fecal samples were tested for a range of
bacterial, viral and protozoal pathogens. Gastroenteric episode duration and
symptoms such as vomiting, nausea and diarrhea were measured.
RESULTS: One or more pathogens were identified in 198 of a total 791 specimens
collected. Pathogens detected most often were Norovirus virus (10.7%), pathogenic
E. coli (6.7%), Campylobacter spp. (3.0%) and Giardia sp. (2.5%). Children were
more prone than adults to all the pathogens tested, except E. coli. Children
infected with Campylobacter were 8.3 times more likely (95% CI: 2.7-25.4) to have
a longer duration of diarrhea than children with Norovirus (P < 0.001).
Similarly, children infected with E. coli had increased persistence of diarrhea
compared to Norovirus (OR = 3.5; 95% CI: 1.3-9.5; P = 0.02). Infection with
Norovirus in children meant greater persistence of vomiting symptoms than
infection with Campylobacter (P = 0.005), E. coli (P = 0.03), or if no pathogen
was identified (P = 0.004). Adults usually vomited for fewer days than children
while duration of diarrhea was similar to children.
CONCLUSIONS: Many of the pathogens responsible for cases of gastroenteritis in
the Australian community are likely to go undetected by current surveillance
systems and routine clinical practice.
