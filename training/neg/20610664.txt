In a cohort study of children < 4 years of age in Greenland, mannose-binding
lectin (MBL2) genotypes and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody levels were
determined. EBV seropositivity was significantly lower and time to seroconversion
increased in MBL-insufficient compared with MBL-sufficient children, indicating
that MBL may be involved in primary EBV infection in infancy.
