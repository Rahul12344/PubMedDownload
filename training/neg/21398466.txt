Beginning in 2002, a small number of pig farms in western Canada began reporting 
4-7-week-old pigs with bilateral hind-end paresis or paralysis. Low numbers of
pigs were affected, some died, most had to be euthanized, and those that survived
had reduced weight gains and neurological deficits. Necropsies revealed no gross 
lesions, but microscopic lesions consisted of a nonsuppurative
polioencephalomyelitis, most severe in the brain stem and spinal cord. The
lesions were most consistent with a viral infection. Tests for circovirus,
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, coronavirus, Rabies virus,
and Pseudorabies virus were negative. Using immunohistochemistry, virus
neutralization, fluorescent antibody test, and nested reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction, Porcine teschovirus was identified in tissues from
affected individuals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of
teschovirus encephalitis in western Canada and the first reported case of
polioencephalomyelitis in pigs in Canada, where teschovirus was confirmed as the 
cause.
