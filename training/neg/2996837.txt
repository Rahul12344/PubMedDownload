Nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage for the diagnosis for Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Caughey G, Wong H, Gamsu G, Golden J.

We compared conventional bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy (TBB) and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage
(NB-BAL) in nine patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and
bilateral lung infiltrates. NB-BAL was carried out with a control-tipped reusable
catheter. In each patient, bronchoscopic procedures were performed in the right
lung, followed immediately by NB-BAL in the left lung. The specimens obtained by 
NB-BAL confirmed the presence of P carinii pneumonia in seven of eight patients
in whom the diagnosis was established by TBB or BAL. Viral cultures of NB-BAL
specimens yielded cytomegalovirus (CMV) in four of five subjects with evidence of
CMV via bronchoscopic technique, including two instances in which CMV was not
detected by BAL. Complications were limited to right-sided pneumothorax
attributable to TBB. Accuracy of NB-BAL appears to be comparable to that of
conventional bronchoscopic approaches in the diagnosis of AIDS-related pulmonary 
infection with P carinii or CMV. NB-BAL may be a safer and more economical
alternative to TBB and BAL in the diagnosis of pulmonary opportunistic
infections.
