Observations on abortions in cattle: a comparison of pathological,
microbiological and immunological findings in aborted foetuses and foetuses
collected at abattoirs.

Miller RB, Quinn PJ.

Fifty nonaborted and 50 aborted bovine foetuses were examined utilizing
histology, immunoelectrophoresis, bacteriology and the fluorescent antibody
technique. Lesions were observed in 12 of the nonaborted foesuses and in four of 
these immunoglobulins were demonstrated. In addition, two of the nonaborted
foetuses had immunoglobulins in the absence of observed lesions. Lesions were
observed in 48 of the aborted foetuses and immunoglobulins were detected in 22 of
these. An etiological diagnosis was arrived at in 24 of the 50 aborted foetuses. 
The tissues most frequently observed to have lesions of diagnostic significance
were eyelid, intestine, liver, lung and placenta. Intestinal lesions were
observed in several foetuses in association with a variety of agents including
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Foetuses diagnosed as aborting because of
mycotic infection consistently displayed lesions in their eyelids. The value of
taking eyelid sections in cases of suspected mycotic abortions, the significance 
of foetal intestinal lesions, the evaluation of abomasal aspirates and the
diagnostic importance of immunoglobulin determinations in aborted foetuses are
discussed.
