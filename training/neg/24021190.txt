Fifty-nine US isolates of HSV-1 and HSV-2 obtained between 1998 and 2004 were
tested for sensitivity to the helicase-primase inhibitor, pritelivir (AIC316, BAY
57-1293) by plaque-reduction assay. All isolates, which were collected prior to
any clinical use of primase-helicase inhibitors, were sensitive and showed mean
EC50 values of 0.026 and 0.029μM for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Furthermore, 
several laboratory-selected acyclovir-resistant HSV mutants were also sensitive
to pritelivir. These data provide a baseline for HSV sensitivity to pritelivir in
general population before it is introduced and broadly used to treat HSV
infection. The data also validate pritelivir as an appropriate therapy for
nucleoside-resistant HSV infections.
