Virus deoxyribonucleic acid sequences in subdiploid and subtetraploid revertants 
of polyoma-transformed cells.

Shani M, Rabinowitz Z, Sachs L.

Polyoma-transformed cells can revert in the properties characteristic of
transformation, although they maintain the polyoma-specific T antigen.
Transformed cells contain the same number of copies of polyoma virus
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) per cell (eight) as revertants with a subdiploid or a
subtetraploid chromosome number. The results indicate that the duplication of
chromosomes in the subtetraploid revertants did not include the chromosomes that 
carry the viral genome. The virus DNA in both transformed and revertant cells was
associated with high-molecular-weight cell DNA. Reversion of the properties of
transformed cells was, therefore, not associated either with a decrease in number
of virus DNA copies per cell or with a lack of association of the virus DNA with 
cell DNA.
