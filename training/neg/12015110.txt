OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and characteristics of reassortment among
Hantaan and Seoul viruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).
METHODS: Mixed infections were initiated in tissue culture, using Hantaan virus
strain 76 - 118 and Seoul virus strain SR-11. Potential reassortant virus plaques
were picked out by multiplex RT-PCR, using primers specific for individual genome
segments (L, M, S) of each strain.
RESULTS: Most of the progeny virus plaques (68.19% of 44) had parental genotype
of 76 - 118 strain or SR-11 strain while 2 of 44 plaques had mixed genotypes that
yielded RT-PCR bands for the same segment of both parental strains. Reassortant
viruses were detected in 68.19% of 44 progeny plaques tested, involving the M and
S segments. In addition, approximately 4.55% of the progeny virus plaques
appeared to contain S or M segments originating from both parental virus strains,
showing that they were diploid.
CONCLUSION: Genetic reassortment can occur between Hantaan virus and Seoul virus 
strains.
