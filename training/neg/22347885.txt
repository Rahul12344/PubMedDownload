Two patients with recent H1N1 virus infection in pregnancy were found to have
raised transaminases. They have both had a mild illness and have recovered with
no adverse effects, and one has delivered a healthy baby while the other is still
pregnant. We suggest that the deranged transaminase concentrations were directly 
linked to the viral infection in the first patient as the abnormal blood results 
predated treatment. The second case is less clear.
