BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks 
worldwide. Clarifying the viral, host, and environmental factors (epidemiologic
triad) associated with severe outcomes can help target public health
interventions.
METHODS: Acute norovirus outbreaks reported to the National Outbreak Reporting
System (NORS) in 2009-2016 were linked to laboratory-confirmed norovirus
outbreaks reported to CaliciNet. Outbreaks were analyzed for differences in
genotype (GII.4 vs non-GII.4), hospitalization, and mortality rates by timing,
setting, transmission mode, demographics, clinical symptoms, and health outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 3747 norovirus outbreaks were matched from NORS and
CaliciNet. Multivariable models showed that GII.4 outbreaks (n = 2353) were
associated with healthcare settings (odds ratio [OR], 3.94 [95% confidence
interval {CI}, 2.99-5.23]), winter months (November-April; 1.55 [95% CI,
1.24-1.93]), and older age of cases (≥50% aged ≥75 years; 1.37 [95% CI,
1.04-1.79]). Severe outcomes were more likely among GII.4 outbreaks
(hospitalization rate ratio [RR], 1.54 [95% CI, 1.23-1.96]; mortality RR, 2.77
[95% CI, 1.04-5.78]). Outbreaks in healthcare settings were also associated with 
higher hospitalization (RR, 3.22 [95% CI, 2.34-4.44]) and mortality rates (RR,
5.65 [95% CI, 1.92-18.70]).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe outcomes more frequently occurred in norovirus outbreaks
caused by GII.4 and those in healthcare settings. These results should help guide
preventive interventions for targeted populations, including vaccine development.
