Previously, we and others have demonstrated that CD4-deficient mice have a normal
number of T cells and B cells with a significant population of CD4-8-TcR alpha
beta+ T cells. Surprisingly, however, these mice lacking CD4 show in vivo
immunoglobulin isotype class switching from IgM to IgG in response to sheep
erythrocytes and vesicular stomatitis virus. In this study we have depleted
various subpopulations of T cells in vivo and shown that the population of
CD4-8-TcR alpha beta+ T cells is responsible for providing "help" in the antibody
response of CD4-deficient mice to vesicular stomatitis virus infection. We have
used antigen-specific proliferation assays and blocking studies with class I and 
II major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-specific purified antibodies to show
that these cells are class II MHC-restricted in responses against the T
cell-dependent antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH). Finally, phenotypic
analysis of the CD4-CD8- thymocytes in CD4-deficient mice shows that these cells 
have a more mature phenotype than the CD4-8- thymocytes in wild type mice. These 
results indicate that CD4 is not absolutely necessary for positive selection or
effector function of class II MHC-restricted helper T cells.
