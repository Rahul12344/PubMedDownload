The large variation in individual response to infection with Rift Valley fever
virus (RVFV) suggests that host genetic determinants play a role in determining
virus-induced disease outcomes. These genetic factors are still unknown. The
systemic inoculation of mice with RVFV reproduces major pathological features of 
severe human disease, notably the hepatitis and encephalitis. A genome scan
performed on 546 (BALB/c × MBT) F2 progeny identified three quantitative trait
loci (QTLs), denoted Rvfs-1 to Rvfs-3, that were associated with disease
susceptibility in MBT/Pas mice. Non-parametric interval-mapping revealed one
significant and two suggestive linkages with survival time on chromosomes 2
(Rvfs-1), 5 (Rvfs-3) and 11 (Rvfs-2) with respective logarithm of odds (LOD)
scores of 4.58, 2.95 and 2.99. The two-part model, combining survival time and
survival/death, identified one significant linkage to Rvfs-2 and one suggestive
linkage to Rvfs-1 with respective LOD scores of 5.12 and 4.55. Under a multiple
model, with additive effects and sex as a covariate, the three QTLs explained
8.3% of the phenotypic variance. Sex had the strongest influence on
susceptibility. The contribution of Rvfs-1, Rvfs-2 and Rvfs-3 to survival time of
RVFV-infected mice was further confirmed in congenic mice.
