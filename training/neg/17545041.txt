OBJECTIVE: To observe the changes in the activity of dendritic cells (DCs) after 
carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) gene transfection mediated by recombinant
adeno-associated virus type2 (rAAV) and tumor cell lysate.
METHODS: Immature DCs isolated from peripheral blood monocytes of
HLA-A11-positive healthy volunteers were infected with the rAAV carrying CEA gene
or loaded with tumor cell lysate. The surface markers of the DCs such as CD40, CD
1alpha, and CD86 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) in the
supernatants of DCs and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) released by the cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTLs) were determined by ELISA detection kit. The specific killing
activity of CTL against LoVo cells was assessed by MTT assay.
RESULTS: The DCs following antigen loading with the two methods both highly
expressed CD40, CD86 and IL-12, and induced specific CTL that specifically
recognized and killed LoVo cells, but the killing effect resulting from rAAV
infection of the DCs was much better than that induced by tumor cell lysate
loading.
CONCLUSION: Both methods of antigen loading can induce mature DCs from peripheral
blood monocyte cells, but rAAV infection of the DCs can be more effective than
tumor cells lysate loading. DCs infected with rAAV may have the potential to
serve as an adjuvant immunotherapy for patients with colorectal carcinoma.
