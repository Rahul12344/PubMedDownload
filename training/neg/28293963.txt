Currently, clinical gene therapy is experiencing a renaissance, with new products
for clinical use approved in Europe and clinical trials for multiple diseases
reporting positive results, especially those using recombinant adeno-associated
viral (rAAV) vectors. Amid this new success, it is prudent to recall that the
field of gene therapy experienced tragic setbacks in 1999 and 2002 because of the
serious adverse events related to retroviral and adenoviral gene delivery in two 
clinical trials that resulted in the death of two patients. In both cases, the
toxicity observed in humans had been documented to occur in animal models.
However, these toxicities were either undetected or underappreciated before they 
arose in humans. rAAVs have been tested extensively in animals and animal models 
of disease, largely without adverse events, except for transient elevation in
liver enzymes in some patients. However, a small but growing number of murine
studies have documented that adeno-associated viral gene delivery can result in
insertional mutagenesis. Herein, the aggregate data are reviewed from multiple
murine studies where genotoxicity associated with rAAV treatment has been
observed. The data emphasize the need for a proactive position to evaluate the
potential risks and possible solutions associated with AAV-mediated gene therapy.
