Different restriction enzyme-generated sticky DNA ends can be joined in vitro.

Hung MC, Wensink PC.

We describe a simple method for joining the 5'-protruding, single-stranded DNA
ends generated by restriction enzymes. The method allows ends with different
sequences to be joined and prevents identical ends from being joined. This is
accomplished by partially filling the single strands in a controlled reverse
transcriptase reaction. Partial filling can create new single-stranded ends that 
can be ligated to different, partially filled ends. In almost all useful cases,
partial filling simultaneously eliminates the self-complementarity of identical
ends and thus prevents them from being joined by DNA ligase. Although all
possible combinations of partially filled ends were not tested, the tests
performed indicate that the method is fairly general. We demonstrate that ends of
the same length can be ligated with useful efficiency if they are: 1) one
nucleotide long and complementary; 2) two nucleotides long and complementary or
have a mismatch (dA:dC) at one position; or 3) three nucleotides long and, in our
test, have a dT:dC mismatch at the middle position.
