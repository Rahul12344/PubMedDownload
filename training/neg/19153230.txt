Elite controllers (EC) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) maintain
viremia below the limit of detection without antiretroviral treatment.
Virus-specific cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes are believed to play a crucial role
in viral containment, but the degree of immune imprinting and compensatory
mutations in EC is unclear. We obtained plasma gag, pol, and nef sequences from
HLA-diverse subjects and found that 30 to 40% of the predefined HLA-associated
polymorphic sites show evidence of immune selection pressure in EC, compared to
approximately 50% of the sites in chronic progressors. These data indicate
ongoing viral replication and escape from cytotoxic T lymphocytes are present
even in strictly controlled HIV-1 infection.
