Influenza pandemics are imminent and represent a major world health concern.
Since vaccinations are expected to be less efficient in the coming years due to
newly emerging influenza virus strains, novel antiviral therapies are urgently
needed. Here, we show that influenza-infected mice, capable of clearing the virus
in the early stages of infection, failed to control inflammation and death.
Sequential administration of Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) at early stage of the
infection protected infected mice from death in a NK cell-dependent manner.
IFN-gamma treatment stimulated NK cell proliferation and function and increased
their number in the bone marrow, blood, spleen, and infected lungs, keeping viral
clearance intact. In parallel, IFN-gamma treatment significantly reduced the
number of T cells and NKT cells in the lungs at the inflammatory phase following 
infection. Thus, rapidly clearing the virus and reducing inflammation by shaping 
the cellular and cytokine profiles in the early stages of infection may favorably
change the fate of influenza pathogenesis.
