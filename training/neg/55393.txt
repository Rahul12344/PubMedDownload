Measurement of dengue virus-specific double-stranded ribonucleic acid in infected
primate cell extracts by microquantitative complement-fixation methods.

Lubiniecki AS, Pfancuff M, Mitchell J.

Microquantitative complement-fixation methods have been applied to the detection 
and quantitation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in cytoplasmic extracts of
uninfected and dengue virus-infected primate cell lines. LLC-MK2 and PGLC-33H
cells exhibited increased levels of dsRNA following dengue virus infection.
Cytoplasmic extracts of infected and uninfected LLC-MK2 cells subjected to
density gradient analysis showed that increased levels of dsRNA were associated
with structures believed to be virus-specific. Primate cell dsRNA and dengue
dsRNA preferentially reacted with rabbit anti-rIn-rCn, while reovirus dsRNA and
rAn-containing synthetic duplexes preferentially reacted with anti-rAn-rUn.
