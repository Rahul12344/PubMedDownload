Translation of reovirus messenger RNAs synthetesized in vitro into reovirus
polypeptides by several mammalian cell-free extracts.

McDowell MJ, Joklik WK, Villa-Komaroff L, Lodish HF.

Single-stranded reovirus RNA, synthesized in vitro by reovirus cores, functioned 
as messenger RNA in cell-free extracts prepared from several mammalian cells:
Krebs II mouse ascites cells, mouse L cells, Chinese hamster ovary cells, HeLa
cells, and rabbit reticulocytes. As shown by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, all 
eight polypeptides known to be specified by reovirus were synthesized in the
reticulocyte system. In the other extracts, from 5 to 7 complete virus proteins
were made.
