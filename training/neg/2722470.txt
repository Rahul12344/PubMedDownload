The aligned restriction endonuclease maps of three sequenced maize streak virus
isolates, three restriction-mapped southern African maize streak virus isolates, 
and two other sequenced geminiviruses were used as a means of calculating the
sequence divergence between these viruses. The degree of divergence was used to
construct a phylogenetic tree for the viruses; this tree agrees well with
predictions from sequence comparisons, and so the method can be used to study the
relationship of geminivirus isolates without the labor and expense of sequencing 
each one.
