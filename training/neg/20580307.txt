MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA molecules approximately 22 nucleotides in
length that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by complementary
binding to target mRNAs. MiRNAs have been identified in a diverse range of both
metazoan and plant species. Functionally, miRNAs modulate multiple cellular
processes including development, hematopoiesis, immunity, and oncogenesis. More
recently, DNA viruses were found to encode and express miRNAs during host
infection. Although the functions of most viral miRNAs are not well understood,
early analysis of target genes pointed to immune modulation suggesting that viral
miRNAs are a component of the immune evasion repertoire, which facilitates viral 
persistence. In addition to directly targeting immune functions, viral encoded
miRNAs contribute to immune evasion by targeting proapoptotic genes, and in the
case of herpesviruses, by controlling viral latency. Here we summarize the
recently discovered targets of viral miRNAs and discuss the complex nature of
this novel emerging regulatory mechanism.
