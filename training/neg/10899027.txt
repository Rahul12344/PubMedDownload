A strong cytotoxic T lymphocyte response to HTLV-I protects against the
associated inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, HAM/TSP
(HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis), by reducing the
proviral load of HTLV-I; however, when the proviral load exceeds a threshold
level, HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes could contribute to inflammation.
