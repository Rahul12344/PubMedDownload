Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor,
cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms. The most characteristic structural feature
of this disease is neurodegeneration accompanied by gliosis in the striatum. BDNF
has been proposed to protect striatal neurons from degeneration, because it is an
important survival factor for these neurons from development to adulthood.
Considering the extensive gliosis and the survival effects of BDNF, we
constructed an adenovirus to express a BDNF cDNA in astrocyte cells using a
promoter of the glial fibrillary acidic protein gene. Cells stably transfected in
vitro with a BDNF cDNA driven by this promoter expressed BDNF and responded to
external stimuli increasing BDNF production. When the vector was applied into the
striata of mice transgenic for HD, long-term expression of the transgene was
observed, associated with a delay of onset of the motor phenotype of the R6/2 HD 
transgenic mice. The present data indicate that the striatal expression of BDNF
is a potential adjuvant for the treatment of HD.
