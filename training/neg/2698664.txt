Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used along with the dut and ung genetic 
selection method of Kunkel to introduce large site-specific deletions into cDNAs 
cloned into phagemid vectors. We find that large deletions can be achieved with
an efficiency equal to that of single point mutations, with a very low frequency 
of aberrent clones. To facilitate screening of clones, E. coli strain DH5 alpha
was used as the recipient host cell to genetically select for deletion mutants.
Comparisons were made to deletion mutagenesis without genetic selection, and to
reactions utilizing two oligonucleotide primers simultaneously. The low frequency
of deletion mutants observed without genetic selection renders random screening
for deletion mutant clones cumbersome. The results provide representative
expectations and a useful guide for those contemplating the construction of
deletion mutants.
