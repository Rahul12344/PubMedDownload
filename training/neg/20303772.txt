A phenanthridinone skeleton was derived from our previous researches on
thalidomide and retinoids as a multi-template for generation of anti-viral lead
compounds. Structural development studies focusing on anti-hepatitis C virus
activity afforded
5-butyl-2-(1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenanthridin-6(5H)-one
(10) and 5-butylbenzo[b]phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (39), which showed EC(50) values 
of approximately 3.7 and 3.2microM, respectively.
