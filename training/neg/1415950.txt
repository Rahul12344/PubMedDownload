DNA is the fundamental guide for the cell's processes. The alterations in DNA
that can lead to abnormal or absent proteins and the role of chromosomal
alterations in changing the function of the DNA are reviewed. The role of viruses
in derailing a cell's normal functions, the major mechanisms of oncogene action, 
and tumor suppressor genes are also discussed.
