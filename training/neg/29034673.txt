Occupational exposure to blood (OEB) is associated with a significant risk of
transmission of bloodborne viruses to medical students. The objective of this
study was to evaluate the knowledge and practices of Casablanca medical students 
concerning OEB preventive measures and their behaviour after accidental exposure.
A cross-sectional study was carried out at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital in
Casablanca using stratified cluster sampling ; data from this study were
collected by means of an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. The mean age 
was 22.38 years (SD = 1.69) with a female predominance (56.0%). About 17.5% of
students had experienced at least one OEB, and only 38.3% were familiar with the 
standard precautions to prevent these accidents. Accidental exposure was
significantly associated with needle recapping (p = 0.002) and ignorance of
standard precautions (p = 0.028).These results illustrate the insufficient
knowledge and poor compliance with preventive measures of occupational exposure
to blood, indicating the need for awareness-raising and training activities for
medical students.
