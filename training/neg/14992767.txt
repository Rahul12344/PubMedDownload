BACKGROUND: A new paramyxovirus, the human metapneumovirus was recently isolated.
We report the first French cases collected between 2000 and 2002.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Samples were obtained from nasopharyngeal aspirates from
children hospitalised for acute respiratory tract infection in hospitals of Caen 
and Flers in Basse-Normandie. Human metapneumovirus was studied by polymerase
chain reaction on negative samples for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A
and B virus, parainfluenza (1, 2 and 3) virus, adenovirus, coronavirus and
rhinovirus. Comparison between metapneumovirus virus and respiratory syncytial
virus infections was done after matching sex, age and infection month.
RESULTS: Twenty-six human metapneumovirus infections were identified. A
comparative study of a matched group of children infected by respiratory
syncytial virus found no significative difference for hospitalisation motive,
clinical criteria and treatment.
CONCLUSION: The human metapneumovirus is responsible for typical acute
bronchiolitis in children.
