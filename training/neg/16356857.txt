Proinflammatory caspases play an essential role in innate immune responses to
infection by regulating the cleavage and activation of proinflammatory cytokines.
Activation of these enzymes requires the assembly of an intracellular molecular
platform, termed the inflammasome, which is comprised of members of the pyrin
domain (PYD)-containing superfamily of apoptosis and inflammation-regulatory
proteins. We report here the identification and characterization of a
poxvirus-encoded PYD-containing protein that interacts with the ASC-1 component
of the inflammasome and inhibits caspase-1 activation and the processing of
IL-1beta and IL-18 induced by diverse stimuli. Knockout viruses that do not
express this protein are unable to productively infect monocytes and lymphocytes 
due to an abortive phenotype and are markedly attenuated in susceptible hosts due
to decreased virus dissemination and enhanced inflammatory responses at sites of 
infection. Thus, modulation of inflammasome function constitutes an important
immunomodulatory strategy employed by poxviruses to circumvent host antiviral
responses.
