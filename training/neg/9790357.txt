OBJECTIVE: The objective was to obtain preliminary pharmacokinetic data for
acyclovir from gravid women receiving herpes simplex virus suppressive therapy
with the acyclovir prodrug valacyclovir.
STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, double-blind trial, 20 women with a history of
recurrent genital herpes simplex virus infection and positive herpes simplex
virus 2 serologic results were randomly assigned at 36 weeks' gestation to
receive oral valacyclovir (500 mg twice daily) or acyclovir (400 mg 3 times
daily). Acyclovir pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained after the initial dose
(36 weeks) and at steady state (38 weeks). Amniotic fluid samples were obtained
during labor and simultaneous umbilical cord and maternal plasma samples were
collected at delivery. Laboratory studies were performed to screen for laboratory
evidence of toxicity in mothers and infants.
RESULTS: Peak acyclovir plasma concentrations (mean +/- standard deviation) were 
higher in valacyclovir recipients than in acyclovir recipients after the initial 
dose (3.14 +/- 0.7 microg/mL vs 0.74 +/- 0.6 microg/mL, P < .0001) and at steady 
state (3.03 +/- 1.0 microg/mL vs 0.94 +/- 0.7 microg/mL, P < .001). The daily
area under the curve values were higher in valacyclovir recipients than acyclovir
recipients after the initial dose (17.8 +/- 3.6 h x microg/mL vs 7.71 +/- 2.5 h x
microg/mL, P < .001) and at steady state (19.65 +/- 6.4 h x microg/mL versus 11.0
+/- 4.5 h x microg/mL, P = .009). There was no significant difference in drug
elimination half-life or in time to peak concentration between valacyclovir and
acyclovir recipients at either sampling interval. Acyclovir was concentrated in
the amniotic fluid; however, there was no evidence of preferential fetal drug
accumulation (mean maternal/umbilical vein plasma ratios at delivery were 1.7 for
valacyclovir and 1.3 for acyclovir). Valacyclovir was well tolerated, and no
significant laboratory or clinical evidence of toxicity was detected.
CONCLUSION: In this phase I trial maternal valacyclovir therapy resulted in
higher plasma acyclovir levels, with significantly higher peak concentrations and
daily area under the curve values, than did acyclovir therapy. Additional trials 
are needed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of suppressive
valacyclovir therapy during late pregnancy.
