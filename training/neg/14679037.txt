Viruses have long been considered among potential environmental triggers of type 
1 diabetes mellitus. Epidemiologic and seroprevalence studies have associated
enterovirus infection with development of prediabetic autoimmunity and with the
onset of clinical diabetes. Enterovirus infection has also been temporally
correlated with disease onset by virus isolation or by detection of viral genome 
by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For the large-scale 
prospective studies that are required to firmly establish a causal relationship
between enterovirus infection and development of prediabetic autoimmunity or
progression from autoimmunity to clinical diabetes, sensitive RT-PCR methods must
be used to detect virus prior to the onset of diabetic symptoms. We have
developed an RT-seminested PCR protocol to detect enteroviruses in clinical
specimens. This method is approximately 10,000-fold more sensitive than
conventional, single-amplification PCR. Further, we have developed molecular
methods to rapidly and reliably identify enterovirus serotype, bypassing the
cumbersome and often problematic neutralization test. The molecular serotyping
approach will be valuable in examining the relationships between particular virus
serotypes or genotypes and specific diseases.
