We investigated the influence of a transient treatment of corticosteroid on CD8+ 
T cells during herpesvirus infection. Dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, 
induced apoptosis of naïve and memory CD8+ T cells but virus-specific effector
cells were spared. CD8+ T cell susceptibility was directly correlated with the
expression of nr3c1. Both α-(HSV1) and γ-(MHV68) herpesvirus infection expanded
CD8+ T cells down regulated nr3c1 indicating corticosteroid-mediated effects were
not limited to one pathogen or the specific clonotype. Dexamethasone compromised 
anti-viral immunity to subsequent infections, likely through reductions in the
naïve cell pool. Dexamethasone augmented the function and inflammatory tissue
homing potential of effector cells via upregulation of CXCR3. Accordingly, an
antibody neutralization of CXCR3 diminished dexamethasone-induced migration of
CD8+ T cells to tissues resulting in increased virus burden. Our study therefore 
suggests that even a transient corticosteroid therapy influences both ongoing
CD8+ T cell responses as well as the size of the naïve and memory repertoire.
