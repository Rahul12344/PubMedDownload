Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) belonging to the
group I nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs) and expressing the envelope-fusion
glycoprotein GP64 transduces a variety of mammalian cells to express foreign
genes under the control of mammalian promoters. In contrast, the group II
Helicoverpa armigera single NPV (HaSNPV) encoding a different envelope protein,
the F protein, shows no detectable infectivity towards mammalian cells. This
limitation was overcome by expressing AcMNPV GP64 in HaSNPV. Although the
transduction ratios were lower overall, the range of mammalian cell types
transduced by HaSNPV was consistent with those transduced by AcMNPV. These
findings indicate that the F protein functions only in insect cells, whereas the 
GP64 protein works in both insect and mammalian cells.
