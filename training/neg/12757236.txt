This study was carried out to determine the presence of markers of hepatitis
viruses in patients with acute liver disease. Coinfection of HAV, HBV, HCV, and
HEV was studied. Sera from 306 patients with a clinical diagnosis of acute liver 
disease were tested for the presence of anti-HAV antibody, HBsAg, anti-HBc
antibody, anti-HBs antibody, anti-HCV antibody and IgM anti-HEV antibody by
ELISA. Liver function tests were correlated with the presence of infection. Of
the 306 cases, 7 (2.3%) had IgM anti-HAV, 9 (2.9%) had IgM anti-HBc, 37 (12.1%)
had HBsAg, 84 (27.4%) had anti-HBs, 10 (3.3%) were HCV infected and 63 (20.6%)
had IgM anti-HEV. There was no significant difference in the clinical and liver
function profiles of infected and uninfected patients. Similarly, no difference
was observed in cases coinfected with more than one virus compared with those
infected with a single pathogen. HEV had the highest prevalence amongst our
cases. There was no difference in the clinical profiles of patients with non-A,
non-B, non-C, non-E hepatitis by antibody assays and testing for viremia could be
helpful in making the correct diagnosis.
