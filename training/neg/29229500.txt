OBJECTIVES: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a potential biomarker for tumor 
diagnosis. Hepatocyte damage is a characteristic component of the pathobiology of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which would be expected to result in substantial 
leakage of cfDNA into the circulation. However, the diagnostic value of cfDNA
levels for HCC remains unclear.
METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from 24 HCC patients and 62 hepatitis B
virus-related liver fibrosis patients. Plasma cfDNA levels were quantified by
Qubit method.
RESULTS: Plasma cfDNA levels were associated with the degree of liver
inflammation, body mass index, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, but were not
associated with fibrosis stages. Plasma cfDNA levels were significantly higher in
HCC patients than in non-HCC patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that age
and cfDNA, rather than AFP, were independent predictors of HCC. The HCC index, a 
combination model including age, cfDNA, and AFP, had an area of 0.98 (95%
confidence interval 0.92-1.00) under the receiver operating characteristics curve
for the diagnosis of HCC at the cut-off value of 0.61, with 87.0% sensitivity and
100% specificity. The diagnostic power of the HCC index was superior to that of
cfDNA alone and AFP alone.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the combination of cfDNA with age and AFP
could improve the diagnostic performance for HCC.
