PURPOSE: Application of Erich arch bar with the help of circumdental wires for
intermaxillary fixation is most widely accepted method for mandibular fractures. 
However, circumdental wires causes injury to periodontium. There is always fear
of inadvertent injury by wire ends and chances of serotransmission of blood born 
viruses to the operator thus, we want to use the safest method of intermaxillary 
fixation avoiding use of circumdental wires.
METHODS AND RESULT: We modified arch bar and bonded it to the dental arches by
light cure composite resin and intermaxillary fixation was done without
circumdental wires. Comparative study against conventional Erich arch bar
fixation and evaluation concerning the oral hygiene, stability and safety of
operator was made among 20 patients in two groups.
CONCLUSION: As per our observation and result, resin bonded arch bar is easy to
apply, causes less periodontal injury, and its application minimizes threat of
percutaneous injury to operator.
