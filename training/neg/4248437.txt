Experimental immunization of sows with cell-cultured TGE virus.

Thorsen J, Djurickovic S.

Five sows were inoculated with a cell-cultured, cytopathic strain of the virus of
transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). Two sows were inoculated intramuscularly,
and three by the intramammary route. The response was measured by the
neutralizing antibody titers in the serum and the milk, and by the protection
against experimental challenge of piglets nursing the sows. There were no marked 
differences in the serum or milk antibody titers resulting after the two methods 
of inoculation, although milk titers at the time of challenge were higher after
intramammary inoculation. Piglets nursing sows inoculated by the intramammary
route were protected to a greater extent than those nursing sows inoculated
intramuscularly.
