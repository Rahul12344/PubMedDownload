By capitalizing on the initially puzzling observations of unpredictable transgene
silencing and variable expression, plant scientists have pioneered research into 
a novel type of epigenetic regulation, termed homology-dependent gene silencing. 
This silencing process has implications for natural mechanisms of gene expression
in plants and other eukaryotes, and has branched out into studies of reversible
DNA modifications; RNA metabolism, transport and processing; and host responses
to plant viruses, viroids and transposable elements. The analysis of transgene
silencing systems has enriched our understanding of other epigenetic phenomena,
including paramutation, as well as heterosis and genome evolution. This research 
is also highly relevant to the biotechnology industry, which is interested in
avoiding unwanted transgene silencing in genetically engineered lines and in
exploiting various types of silencing to inactivate specific genes.
Homology-dependent gene silencing can also be used in high-throughput approaches 
for functional genomics.
