Multivalent dengue vaccines now in late stage development pose unique vaccine
safety challenges in that primary or secondary vaccine failures might place
vaccines at risk to antibody-dependent enhanced (ADE) wild-type dengue
infections. This conference was organized to address this unique vaccine safety
issue. New data were presented on the structure of dengue and other flaviviruses,
the cellular receptors of dengue virus for biologically relevant cells, dengue
viral cell entry mechanisms and mechanisms underlying in vivo protection,
neutralization and enhancement of dengue virus infection. It was concluded that a
targeted research program should aim to develop an in vitro test to characterize 
persons immunized with dengue vaccines as completely or partially protected.
Achievement of this aim will require a better understanding of the basic
mechanisms by which dengue viruses recognize, attach, enter and infect relevant
human cells and how antibodies protect against dengue infections.
