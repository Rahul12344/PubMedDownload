Long-term drug therapy for HIV-1 infection can prevent both disease progression
and virus transmission, but treatment does not eradicate the virus. A new gene
therapy study (Immunity 2019;50:567-575.e5) using human antibodies shows
significant promise for a functional cure in a non-human primate model.
