To define predictive or contributory risk factors for pancreatitis in human
immunodeficiency virus-infected children receiving dideoxyinosine (ddI), the
authors evaluated 95 children, 3 months to 18 years of age, who had received ddI 
at 60 to 540 mg/m2 per day for a mean of 56 weeks. Pancreatitis developed in 7
patients (7%) but resolved in all upon withdrawal of ddI. Neither age, sex, nor
CD4 count at study entry was predictive of pancreatitis, but pancreatitis
appeared more likely to develop in hemophiliacs than in other patients (4 of 23
vs 3 of 72). Pancreatitis developed only in patients who received ddI at the
highest dose levels (7 of 60 patients who received ddI at a dose > or = 360 mg/m2
per day vs 0 of 35 patients who received < or = 270 mg/m2 per day). Patients in
whom pancreatitis developed had received a higher mean daily dose of ddI than
patients with normal amylase and lipase levels throughout the study (348 mg/m2 vs
282 mg/m2), but no relationship with the cumulative dose or the duration of ddI
therapy was observed. Although a statistically significant relationship between
ddI plasma concentration (area under the curve) and pancreatitis was not
conclusively demonstrated, as the number of patients in whom pancreatitis
actually developed was small, such a relationship may have been
obscured.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
