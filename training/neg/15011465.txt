AIM: Results of the serologic confirmation of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in patients with clinical picture and overt symptoms of the
disease from particular areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina during 2002 are
presented.
METHODS: A total of 146 sera from 100 clinically suspected patients were tested. 
The sera were tested for the presence of specific IgM antibodies to Hantaan and
Puumala antigens by Elisa IgM "capture" test, and for the presence of specific
antibodies to Hantaan, Puumala and Dobrava antigens by Elisa IgG test.
DISCUSSION: Most of the positive IgM reactions were recorded as cross reactions
to Hantaan and Puumala antigens, and most of the positive IgG reactions as cross 
reactions to Hantaan and Dobrava antigens. The finding of antibodies in the sera 
of patients from Europe that react with Hantaan antigen are not associated with
the infection with Hantaan, but with the infection with viruses that are
genetically related with Hantaan. To date, HFRS caused by Puumala and Dobrava
viruses has been verified in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
CONCLUSION: Using Elisa IgM "capture" test, acute hantavirus infection was
serologically confirmed in 38% of clinically suspected patients with manifested
symptoms from different areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2002. The distribution
of human hantavirus infection in Bosnia and Herzegovina was confirmed by the
presence of specific hantavirus antibodies in patient sera.
