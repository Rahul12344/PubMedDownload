The E6 and E7 genes of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) immortalize rat
primary embryo fibroblast cells (REF) but do not transform them, irrespective of 
the expressions of the two genes. Previously, we reported that REF cells suppress
the transformed phenotypes of a rat cell line transformed by the E6 and E7 genes 
of HPV16 in somatic hybrid cells. REF cells immortalized by HPV16 E6E7 genes (671
cells) also retained the ability to suppress E6E7-mediated transformation.
Transformation of 671 cells by retroviruses containing middle T of polyomavirus, 
v-K-ras, or v-mos was also suppressed. 671 cells infected with retrovirus having 
middle T of polyomavirus (PyMLV) expressed sufficient middle T protein to
transform a rat cell line. Cell fusion experiments showed that 671 cells
suppressed transformation by middle T of polyomavirus without affecting the
expression of middle T. These results suggest that REF cells immortalized by
HPV16 E6E7 genes possess an intracellular function that suppresses transformation
not only by E6E7 genes but also by other viral oncogenes including middle T of
polyomavirus.
