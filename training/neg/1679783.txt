The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from an infected
surgeon to a patient is probably very low. In separate studies, the patients of
four surgeons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been followed
up; no evidence of transmission was found. However, a recent report suggests that
a dentist with AIDS may have transmitted HIV infection to a patient during the
extraction of two molar teeth. Whether HIV-infected health care workers who
perform invasive procedures ought to be obliged to discontinue or modify their
practice continues to be debated.
