BACKGROUND: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(CA-MRSA) frequently causes severe necrotizing pneumonia in young patients.
CASE: We present the case of a 24-year-old male, who was brought to the emergency
department with persistent fevers, confusion, and severe cough. He was found to
have necrotizing pneumonia, pneumomediastinum, and rhabdomyolysis with renal
failure. Cultures were positive for influenza A and CA-MRSA. After a prolonged
intensive care unit (ICU) stay, he made a complete recovery.
CONCLUSION: Community-acquired MRSA pneumonia is a growing health threat that
typically presents in young adults after, or in conjunction with, a flu-like
illness. It is characterized by a rapidly progressive deteriorating clinical
course.
