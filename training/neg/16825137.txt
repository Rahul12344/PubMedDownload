AIM: The aim of the study was to identify the relationship of acquired
neutropenias with infections in childhood and to assess their course,
complications, short and long-term outcome.
METHOD: During a two-year period, all children admitted to the pediatric ward
with neutropenia were investigated for underlying infections with indices of
infection, cultures of body fluids and serological tests.
RESULTS: Sixty-seven previously healthy children, aged (median, 25-75%) 0.7 years
(0.2-1.5), were identified with neutropenia (frequency: 2.0%). An infectious
agent was identified in 34/67 cases (50.7%) (viral infection: n=24, bacterial:
n=10). In 50/67 (74.6%) children, neutropenia recovered within 2 months
(transient neutropenia, TN), while in 17/67 (25.4%) of them it persisted for more
than two months. Two years after diagnosis 50/67 children (74.6%) accepted to be 
reassessed. Of these children, 8/50 (16%) remained neutropenic (neutropenic
children, NC), while 42/50 had recovered completely.
CONCLUSION: Neutropenia during childhood is usually transient, often following
viral and common bacterial infections, does not present serious complications and
in the majority, it resolves spontaneously. However, in a significant percentage 
of patients, neutropenia is discovered during the course of an infection, on a
ground of a preceding chronic neutropenic status.
