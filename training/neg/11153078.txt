In neurodegenerative diseases associated with AIDS, reactive astrocytosis plays a
central role in the neurotoxicity of the brain parenchyma. Whereas the HIV-1 nef 
gene is overexpressed during restricted HIV-1 infection of human astrocytes, our 
previous results have demonstrated that nef expressed in human U251MG glial cells
activates the sphingomyelin pathway triggered by TNF-alpha, increasing ceramide
production. Since ceramide is an important regulatory molecule of programmed cell
death induced by TNF-alpha, we examined whether nef could alter TNF-alpha-induced
apoptosis in the U251MG human astrocytoma cell line. Transfection studies
indicated that nef could both prevent apoptosis and promote cell proliferation in
response to TNF-alpha stimulation. MAPK and JNK activities were further analyzed 
in order to elucidate signaling cascades subsequent to the upregulation of
ceramide production. After TNF-alpha treatment, both kinases were shown to be
preferentially activated in the presence of nef. These experiments strongly
suggest that the HIV-1 Nef protein might modulate the sensitivity of astrocytes
to inflammatory molecules, thus contributing to the development of
neurodegenerative diseases associated with AIDS.
