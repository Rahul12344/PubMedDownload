Growth inhibition of cells in cultures and of vaccinia virus infected HeLa cells 
by derivatives of trifluorothymidine.

Parkhurst JR, Danenberg PV, Heidelberger C.

The effects of 5-trifluoromethyluracil (F3Thy), 5-trifluoromethyl-2'-deoxyuridine
(F3dThd), F3dThd-5'-P, and F3dThd-5'-methylphosphonate on the growth of HeLa
cells, Novikoff hepatoma cells, L5178Y mouse leukemia cells, and on the
replication of vaccinia virus in HeLa cells have been determined. F3Thy and
F3dThd-5'-methylophosphonate were approximately 500-fold and 100-fold less
effective, respectively, than F3dThd or F3dThd-5'-P in their inhibition of these 
cells. F3dThd and F3dThd-5'-P are potent inhibitors of vaccinia viral replication
of HeLa cells. The nucleoside and nucleotide were 1,000-fold more inhibitory than
the free base. F3dThd was nost inhibitory when added between 1 and 2 h
post-infection; however, it was also somewhat inhibitory when added at later
times.
