Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have been described as suppressors of
T-cell function in many malignancies. Impaired T-cell responses have been
observed in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (CHC), which is
reportedly associated with the establishment of persistent HCV infection.
Therefore, we hypothesized that MDSCs also play a role in chronic HCV infection. 
MDSCs in the peripheral blood of 206 patients with CHC and 20 healthy donors were
analyzed by flow cytometry. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy
donors cultured with hepatitis C virus core protein (HCVc) were stimulated with
or without interleukin 10 (IL-10). Compared to healthy donors and certain CHC
patients with sustained viral response (SVR), CHC patients without SVR presented 
with a dramatic elevation of G-MDSCs with the HLA-DR-/low CD33+ CD14- CD11b+
phenotype in peripheral blood. The frequency of G-MDSCs in CHC patients was
positively correlated with serum HCVc, and G-MDSCs were induced from healthy
PBMCs by adding exogenous HCVc. Furthermore, we revealed a potential mechanism by
which HCVc mediates G-MDSC polarization; activation of ERK1/2 resulting in IL-10 
production and IL-10-activated STAT3 signalling. Finally, we confirmed that
HCVc-induced G-MDSCs suppress the proliferation and production of IFN-γ in
autologous T-cells. We also found that the frequency of G-MDSCs in serum was
associated with CHC prognosis. HCVc maintains immunosuppression by promoting
IL-10/STAT3-dependent differentiation of G-MDSCs from PBMCs, resulting in the
impaired functioning of T-cells. G-MDSCs may thus be a promising biomarker for
predicting prognosis of CHC patients.
