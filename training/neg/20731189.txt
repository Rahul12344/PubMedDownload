The results of 4-year serological and 2-year virological monitoring studies of
bluetongue (BT) disease in ruminants imported to Poland from EU countries are
presented. Sera were screened using the c-ELISA and direct ELISA tests. Out of
49587 samples of sea, 3385 (6.83% of a total number of samples) were found to be 
positive for bluetongue virus (BTV). The majority of seropositive animals were
imported to Poland from Germany, Czech Republic and The Netherlands. The high
number of positive animals detected in 2008-2009 was the result of bluetongue
vaccination implemented in BTV-infected EU countries in 2008. The rRT-PCR was
applied to detect viral RNA in blood samples. The presence of BTV RNA was found
in 38 samples of blood collected from German cows, one sample from Dutch fallow
deer and one sample from a 4-week-old calf born from BT positive dam imported
from Germany. On the basis of present results it can be stated that the
implemented virological surveillance investigations should be continued to
monitor the actual BT status in Poland. As it is impossible to differentiate
infected from vaccinated animals and deduce whether the animals have been or have
not been vaccinated properly, the continuation of serological monitoring studies 
using actually available ELISA kits should be reconsidered.
