OBJECTIVE: We report 10 cases of histoplasmosis with oral manifestations seen in 
a teaching hospital in Brazil.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of the sociodemographic,
clinicopathologic, and treatment data of these cases.
RESULTS: Overall, 8 of 10 cases were seropositive for human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), whereas 2 were negative. The predominant oral manifestations found
in HIV-seropositive patients were ulcers, oral pain, and odynophagia; both of the
HIV-seronegative patients were symptom-free. HIV infection was suspected in 7
cases because of the presence of oral lesions of histoplasmosis. Asthenia, fever,
weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly were found only in
HIV-seropositive patients. Radiographs in 3 out of 10 patients suggested
pulmonary involvement. Amphotericin B was the antifungal therapy chosen, and
clinical remission of oral lesions occurred in an average of 30 days (accumulated
doses: 500-1500 mg). Itraconazole was very effective as a follow-up treatment in 
terms of prevention of recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Histoplasmosis only rarely affects HIV-seronegative patients;
however, the possibility of hidden immunodepression should be considered when
oral manifestations of histoplasmosis are present.
