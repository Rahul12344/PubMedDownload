Indoor ultra-low volume (ULV) applications of Aqua Reslin Super (Permethrin +
s-bioallethrin) were carried out using portable Solo Port 423 sprayers in an
urban area of Reforma, Chiapas, Mexico. Sprayers were calibrated to discharge a
flow rate of 110 ml/min with a dose range of approximately 0.55 to 0.792 mg Al/m3
space. Entomological evaluation, based on 3 cages per house, each containing 15
sugar-fed, 2-4-day-old Aedes aegypti females and placed in hidden locations in 4 
randomly selected houses for 15 min, showed 98.8% to 100% mortality. After the
spraying, ovitrap data showed no mosquito adults present 4 days after the
applications, and only 1 ovitrap out of 60 positive 8 days after the
intervention. This evaluation suggests that indoor ULV application can be useful 
during emergencies after disasters, during dengue outbreaks, or to prevent
mosquito population outbreaks before rainy seasons and, therefore, the onset of
dengue transmission in Mexican dengue transmission risk areas.
