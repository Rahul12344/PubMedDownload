OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients with chronic viral hepatitis are at an
increased risk for antiandrogen hepatotoxicity.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 121 prostate cancer patients who received
long-term antiandrogen, either flutamide (n = 56) or cyproterone acetate (n =
65), and had normal pretreatment serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels.
Serological markers of hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) were checked in 42
of the 121 patients.
RESULTS: Twenty-two (18%) of the 121 patients had ALT elevations during
antiandrogen therapy. Thirteen (59%) of the 22 patients were positive for either 
one of the two viral markers, including 7 for HBV, 4 for HCV, and 2 for both.
This percentage was higher than the combined prevalence rate of positivity for
HBV and/or HCV markers (<20%) in Taiwan. There was no significant differences in 
the percentage of positive makers among the two antiandrogen groups (p = 0.092). 
Although a higher incidence of hepatotoxicity was noted in the flutamide (13/56, 
23%) than in the cyproterone acetate group (9/65, 14%), there were no significant
differences between the two groups (p = 0.27). The time period between initiation
of antiandrogen and first ALT elevation varied significantly (from 4 to 1,398
days with a median of 151 days). Half of the 14 HBV carriers and all of the 6
patients with anti-HCV developed antiandrogen hepatotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: Our limited data suggested that patients with chronic viral hepatitis
probably are at a higher risk of developing antiandrogen hepatotoxicity. Close
monitoring of liver functions in patients with chronic viral hepatitis is advised
if antiandrogen therapy is necessary. However, a large-scale study is necessary
for a definitive conclusion.
