We investigated adenovirus (Ad) infection of the intestine and Ad group-specific 
fecal IgA antibody responses in seven infants who were followed up from birth to 
16 months to seven years of age. We isolated in tissue culture from fecal samples
not only enteric Ad type 41 but also other Ads (types 2, 3, 5, 6, and 12). We
also detected Ad antigens in the feces by ELISA at the times of infection with
even non-enteric Ads, suggesting that a large amount of antigens were produced in
the intestine. We found that repeated Ad infections with different serotypes were
occurring and there were good fecal IgA antibody responses at each time. The
infection seemed usually mild or asymptomatic: only one out of 23 occasions of
the detected infections required hospitalization.
