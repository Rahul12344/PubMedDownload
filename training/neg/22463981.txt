The characterization of viral genomes has accelerated due to improvement in DNA
sequencing technology. Sources of animal samples and molecular methods for the
identification of novel viral pathogens and steps to determine their
pathogenicity are listed. The difficulties for predicting future cross-species
transmissions are highlighted by the wide diversity of known viral zoonoses.
Recent surveys of viruses in wild and domesticated animals have characterized
numerous viruses including some closely related to those infecting humans. The
detection of multiple genetic lineages within viral families infecting a single
host species, phylogenetically interspersed with viruses found in other host
species, reflects past cross-species transmissions. Numerous opportunities for
the generation of novel vaccines will arise from a better understanding of animal
viromes.
