The nut site of bacteriophage lambda is made of RNA and is bound by transcription
antitermination factors on the surface of RNA polymerase.

The boxA and boxB components of the lambda nut site are important for
transcriptional antitermination by the phage N protein. We show here that boxA
and boxB RNA in N-modified transcription complexes are inaccessible to
ribonucleases and have altered sensitivity to dimethylsulfate. N and NusA suffice
to weakly protect boxB, independently of boxA and other factors. However,
efficient protection of the entire nut site from ribonucleases requires boxA and 
boxB, N, NusA, NusB, S10, and NusG. Mutations in RNA polymerase, which inhibit
antitermination by N in vivo, disallow protection of the nut site during
transcription in vitro; therefore, the surface of RNA polymerase must coordinate 
the formation of complexes containing the antitermination factors and nut site
RNA.
