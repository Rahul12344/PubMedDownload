Acanthamoeba infection has been described as an opportunistic infection in
persons with AIDS. We report two cases of patients with AIDS and acanthamoeba
infection and review the manifestations of this protozoan infection in patients
infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The diagnosis of this infection
requires a high index of suspicion because the clinical and histologic
manifestations may be confused with those of disseminated fungal or algal
disease. Clinicians and laboratory personnel should be aware of this potentially 
fatal condition so that appropriate diagnostic studies can be performed and
treatment can be urgently administered. Early initiation of therapy may alter the
clinical outcome of the disease.
