BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether use of contemporary protease inhibitors pose a 
similar risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as use of older protease inhibitors.
METHODS: Participants in the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs 
(D:A:D) study were followed up until the earliest occurrence of CKD, the last
visit plus 6 months, or 1 February 2016. Adjusted Poisson regression was used to 
assess associations between CKD and the use of ritonavir-boosted atazanavir
(ATV/r) or ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV/r).
RESULTS: The incidence of CKD (10.0/1000 person-years of follow-up; 95%
confidence interval, 9.5-10.4/1000 person-years of follow-up) increased gradually
with increasing exposure to ATV/r, but the relation was less clear for DRV/r.
After adjustment, only exposure to ATV/r (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.4; 95%
confidence interval, 1.2-1.6), but not exposure to DRV/r (1.0; .8-1.3), remained 
significantly associated with CKD.
CONCLUSION: While DRV/r use was not significantly associated with CKD an
increasing incidence with longer ATV/r use was confirmed.
