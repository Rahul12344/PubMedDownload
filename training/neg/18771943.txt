OBJECTIVES: The number of HIV-infected refugees entering the USA is increasing.
There is little data describing the HIV-infected refugee population and the
challenges encountered when caring for them. We performed a retrospective
case-control analysis of HIV-infected refugees in order to characterize their
co-morbidities, baseline HIV characteristics, and longitudinal care compared to
HIV-infected non-refugees.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of HIV-infected refugees and 
non-refugees who were matched for gender, age, and time of establishment of
initial HIV care.
RESULTS: The refugee population studied was largely from West Africa. Refugees
were more likely than non-refugees to have heterosexual risk for HIV infection,
latent tuberculosis infection, and active hepatitis B. Refugees were less likely 
than non-refugees to have a history of substance use, start antiretrovirals, and 
be enrolled in a clinical study. The baseline CD4 counts and HIV plasma viral
loads were similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians caring for West African HIV-infected refugees should be
knowledgeable about likely co-morbidities and the impact of cultural differences 
on HIV care. Further studies are needed to develop culturally competent HIV
treatment, education, and prevention programs for refugees who are beginning a
new life in the USA.
