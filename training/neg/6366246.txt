Analysis of the coliphage T5 DNA ejection process with free and
liposome-associated TonA protein.

Tosi F, Labedan B, Legault-DÃ©mare J.

Outer membrane protein TonA, the receptor for coliphage T5, has been partially
purified and incorporated into the phospholipid bilayer of liposomes. Adsorption 
of the phage to its receptor in either a free or liposome-associated form is fast
and sufficient to trigger the ejection of encapsidated DNA. In both in vitro
systems the exit of DNA from the phage capsid is a very slow process. Ejected DNA
can partially accumulate inside the liposome aqueous compartment, but the
transfer from the phage head to the liposome internal space is never complete,
perhaps because the liposome volume is too small. The presence of polyamines or
divalent cations (magnesium) or both in the incubation medium diminished the
extent of DNA ejection, possibly by stabilizing DNA inside the head. DNA movement
was slowed as the temperature was decreased from 37 to 18 degrees C. Furthermore,
incubation at 4 degrees C totally prevented this DNA movement, even if a large
part of the DNA had already exited the capsid.
