An assay involving reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction
specifically detected tobacco rattle virus RNA in extracts of infected plants. It
detected a wide range of serological variants and typical non-particle producing 
NM-type isolates. The sensitivity of the method was sufficient to detect TRV RNA 
in 10 ng total nucleic acid from an infected plant, or in a relatively crude
nucleic acid preparation from 60 micrograms infected leaf tissue.
