By vaccination with an attenuated Marek's disease virus (MDV), strain CVI988,
chickens are protected from the development of T cell lymphoma caused by an
oncogenic MDV. To clarify the role of T lymphocyte subsets in the protection
mechanisms of this vaccine, vaccinated chickens were depleted of T cell subsets
by neonatal thymectomy and injections of monoclonal antibodies specific to
chicken CD4 and CD8 molecules, and then challenged with an oncogenic MDV, strain 
Md5. The MDV titers rescued from CD8(+) T cells, which are the main targets for
latent infection and subsequent transformation by MDV, was much higher in the
CD8-deficient vaccinated chickens than in untreated vaccinated chickens at the
early stage of the latent phase. However, the neonatal vaccination prevented
lymphoma formation by strain Md5 even in either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell-depleted 
chickens. These results suggest that specific CD8(+) T cell responses induced by 
the MD vaccine play a crucial role in the prevention of MDV infection during the 
latent phase, but may not be essential for the prevention of lymphoma formation
by an oncogenic MDV.
