Repeated titrations of strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are more
conveniently undertaken in cell cultures rather than in embryonated eggs. This is
relatively easy with mesogenic and velogenic strains that are cytopathic to
various cell lines, but is difficult with avirulent Australian isolates that are 
poorly cytopathic. Strain V4 for example has been shown to be pathogenic iin
vitro only to of chicken embryo liver cells. Strain I-2 was reported to produce
cytopathic effect (CPE) on chicken embryo kidney (CEK) cells. The present studies
confirmed this observation and developed a quantal assay. CEK cells infected with
strain I-2 developed CPE characterized by degeneration, rounding, granularity and
vacuolation, and the formation of synctia. End points were readily established by
microscopic examination of fixed and stained cells. In virus infectivity studies 
on strain I-2, where multiple titrations are required and where large numbers of 
samples are used, titration using CEK cell grown in microtitre plates is
recommended. Such studies may not be feasible in embryonated eggs.
