This study analyzes the correlation of basic laboratory test results with
clinical outcome in 94 children with perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency 
virus 1 infection who did not receive zidovudine during the study period of 1983 
to 1988. Two life-threatening conditions highly correlated with survival,
opportunistic infection and severe encephalopathy, were the end points of the
study. At a median age of 25 months 30 (32%) of the 94 children had developed
such conditions (Group I), and their survival at 3 years of age was 48% (95%
confidence interval, 24 to 72%), contrasting with the 97% survival rate (95%
confidence interval, 94 to 100%) of the remaining 64 (68%) children who had not
developed such conditions by age 25 months. (Group II). Compared with children in
Group II, children with life-threatening complications were more likely at the
onset of symptoms to be younger and have a lower CD4 count, an impaired in vitro 
lymphocytic proliferation and a lack of p18 or p25 antibodies in the Western blot
profile and, during the progression of the disease, a negative slope of the
subsequent CD4 counts. These results highlight the need for an early diagnosis of
the human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection in children and demonstrate that it 
is possible to determine the prognosis of their disease as early as in the first 
year of life.
