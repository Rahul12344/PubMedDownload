Analysis of the HIV-1 V3 quasispecies present in an individual at the time of
seroconversion was carried out. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to
amplify proviral HIV-1 DNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
a patient who was viraemic (p24 = 15 pg/ml) and had an equivocal HIV-1 antibody
status. The PCR products were cloned and the DNA sequence determined for 15
clones. These data showed that the V3 region contained only limited sequence
heterogeneity with a major variant accounting for 66% of the protein quasispecies
present. The protein sequence of the principal neutralising domain on all species
contained the relatively rare GPGKTL motif rather than GPGRAF. The relevance of
these data for early stages of HIV infection are discussed.
