The replication of two pathotypes of avian reovirus, 1733 and 2177 in transformed
chicken lymphoid and myeloid cell lines was examined, showing that only the
macrophage cell line, HD11, supports replication. The virulent strain 1733 causes
a lytic infection producing 100-1000 fold more virus than the avirulent strain
2177. Cells infected with strain 2177 display delayed viral RNA and protein
synthesis as well as a suppressed expression of the major capsid protein muB.
These features may contribute to the lower virulence of the strain 2177 in their 
natural host in vivo.
