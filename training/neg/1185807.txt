Dynamic alterations in some surface properties of freshly explanted Moloney
lymphoma cells.

Ran M, Eshel I, Witz IP, Klein G.

When Moloney lymphoma (YAC) cells were freshly explanted from the tumor-bearing
host into culture, two events occurred in the first 120 minutes: The cells lost
their natural IgG coat, and their sensitivity to complement-dependent lysis (CdL)
mediated by antibodies to Moloney lymphoma cells decreased or increased. An
increasing sensitivity to CdL as a function of incubation time at 37 degrees C
was likely to occur when the sensitivity to CdL was low at explantation. A
decreasing sensitivity to CdL was probable in instances of a high sensitivity to 
CdL at explantation. Artifical coating of YAC cells with antibodies to Moloney
lymphoma immediately after explantation moderated the alterations in their
sensitivity to CdL. This occurred even though a functional antibody did not
remain on the cells as evidenced from the gradual decreased sensitivity of these 
artifically coated cells to the addition of complement. Spent culture media in
which freshly explanted cells grew for 60 or 120 minutes sometimes blocked CdL of
YAC cells mediated by antibodies to Moloney lymphoma.
