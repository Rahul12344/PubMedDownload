BACKGROUND: In consideration of recent developments in understanding the genomics
and proteomics of viruses, the use of viral DNA / RNA sequences as well as their 
gene expression schemes, have found new in-roads towards the prognosis and
therapy of diseases. Correspondingly, the sphere of the patenting scenario has
expanded significantly.
OBJECTIVES: The current review addresses patented inventions concerning the use
of virus sequences as gene silencing machineries and inventions concerning the
generation and application of viral sequences as expression vectors. Furthermore,
this review also discusses the employment of these patents for clinical,
agricultural and biotechnological applications.
METHOD: Considering these objectives, the Delphion Research Intellectual Property
Network database was searched using keywords such as "gene silencing",
"engineered viruses" and "expression vectors" and descriptions of recent patents 
on the said topics were discussed.
CONCLUSION: Despite several recent advances in the use of viruses as disease
therapy vehicles and biotechnological vectors, these developments have yet to be 
proven effective in practice, in clinical and field trials.
