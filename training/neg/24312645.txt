OBJECTIVE: Iran has the highest rate of opiate use worldwide. However, most
opiate users are not screened for hepatitis virus infections. This study aimed to
provide accurate, detailed data on the size of the opiate user population at risk
of developing these infections.
METHOD: This seroprevalence study was conducted in the city of Shiraz, southern
Iran. All participants were screened for HBV, HCV and HIV infection. The data
were analyzed with SPSS.
RESULT: Among 569 participants, 233 (40.9%) were injection drug users (IDU), 369 
(64.8%) were heterosexual, 84 (14.7%) were bisexual and 15 (2.6%) were
homosexual. One hundred nine (19.1%) were HCV antibody-positive, 18 (3.1%) were
HBS antigen-positive, 72 (12.6%) were HBc antibody-positive and 23 (4%) were
HIV-positive. Among IDU compared to non-IDU, positivity rates for HBS antigen
(5.5 vs 1.4%), HBc antibody (22.7 vs 5.6%), HCV antibody (40.3 vs 4.4%) and HIV
(7.7 vs 1.4%) were higher (P < 0.05). Most patients with HBV (80.7%) and HCV
infection (83.4%) were HIV-negative. In the cumulative analysis, only history of 
imprisonment was a statistically significant determinant of infection by HCV or
HBV in opiate users.
CONCLUSION: The current policy of screening only HIV-positive drug users for HBV 
and HCV in Iran misses most cases of HBV and HCV infection. We therefore
recommend urgent revision of the nationwide protocol by the Ministry of Health in
Iran to implement routine screening of all opiate users and especially IDU for
these viruses, regardless of their HIV status.
