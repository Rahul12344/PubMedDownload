Penicillin resistance plasmid was transferred from Staphylococcus aureus B4
(PcrKms, donor) to S. aureus ML351 (PcsKmr, recipient) by co-cultivation of the
donor with the recipient in nutrient broth with or without the modifying effects 
of CaCl2 or sodium dodecyl sulfate. It was found that the transfer of
drug-resistance occurred maximally between 6 and 18 hr postinoculation; however, 
addition of DNase (200 micrograms/ml) could totally prevent such a transfer up to
6 hr and significantly reduce it thereafter. Cell-free filtrate of the donor
culture when mixed with the recipient was ineffective in bringing about the
transfer of Pcr.
