Ebola virus disease (EVD) went in the space of a few months from being a
forgotten tropical disease to a global "health emergency". The scope of this
Ebola virus epidemic (Zaire strain), which has broken out in West Africa, its
spread and the high number of deaths reported among frontline health workers are 
unprecedented. This article describes how a specialist hospital deals with
imported cases of EVD.
