Foot-and-mouth disease virus leader proteinase (L(pro)), a papain-like cysteine
proteinase, has six acidic amino acids between 4 A and 11 A of the catalytic dyad
of Cys51 and His148. In contrast, in papain and related enzymes, only one acidic 
residue lies within this distance. We have examined by site-directed mutagenesis 
the importance of each of these residues for L(pro) self-processing and cleavage 
of its cellular substrate, eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI. Only substitution of
the electrostatic charge of aspartate 164 affected enzyme activity. Thus, in
contrast to the prototype papain, L(pro) activity requires a negative charge 4.5 
A from the catalytic dyad.
