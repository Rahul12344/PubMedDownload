A 56-year-old man presented with an inguinal lymph node enlargement. Histologic
study of the tumor revealed three intermingled pathologic lesions: a nodular
small cell lymphoma, an angiofollicular hyperplasia of vasculohyaline type, and a
vascular neoplasia closely resembling Kaposi's sarcoma. The patient was
immunocompetent and denied any homosexual relationships, transfusions, or drug
use. The serum was negative for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus
antibody. Computed tomographic scan and ultrasound examination revealed no other 
lymphadenopathies. This case shows that both hyperplastic and neoplastic lymphoid
proliferations can occur simultaneously with vascular neoplasia. It thereby
suggests that the neoplastic populations might interact to favor the tumor
growth, the sequence and the nature of the stimulating events remaining unclear.
