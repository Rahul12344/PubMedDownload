Two hundred women with abnormal Pap smears and/or vulvar symptoms and 30 with
normal Pap smears were investigated to determine the association between symptoms
and (i) human papilloma virus infection of the vulva, and (ii) a spongiotic
tissue reaction or a spongiotic dermatitis of the vulva. All had vulvar
colposcopy and biopsy Human papilloma virus infection was diagnosed by
histopathology and in situ hybridisation technique. HPV infection was present in 
biopsies of 48% of asymptomatic women and 33% with symptoms (p = 0.13) and HPV
DNA in 37% of asymptomatic women and 31% with symptoms (p = 0.72). Spongiotic
tissue reaction was diagnosed in 53.5% of asymptomatic women compared to 74% of
symptomatic women (p = 0.007). This study suggests that vulvar symptoms are not
clinical manifestations of HPV infection, but may be caused by dermatitis rather 
than HPV infection per se.
