In our experiments, protein synthesis of host cells were inhibited quickly at the
early stage of infection by Sindbis virus. Polysome and mRNA of host cell fell
off from cytoskeletons, whereas virus RNA bound up. We also found it was via
3'-terminal that virus RNA bound with cytoskeleton. After studying on the virus
nonstructural proteins, we found the synthesis and processing of virus protein in
vitro were far slowly than in vivo, and most of proteins were premature. So, the 
cytoskeletons may play an important role there. After treated with colchicine and
cytochalasin B, the microtubule and microfilament were destroyed. However, the
synthesis and processing of nonstructural proteins of Sindbis virus didn't change
much, while the structural proteins were inhibited largely. These results showed 
the differences of dependence of the synthesis of the two kinds of proteins on
cytoskeletons. Microtubule and microfilament may be more important to the
synthesis of structural proteins than to that of the nonstructural proteins.
