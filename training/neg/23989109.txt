Viruses are prominent causative agents of acute gastroenteritis in children <5
years of age per year. In the present review, all viral gastroenteritis studies
in Iran were assessed, and the mean prevalences of rotaviruses, noroviruses,
enteric adenoviruses, sapoviruses and astroviruses associated with acute
gastroenteritis were 39.9%, 6%, 5.7%, 4.2% and 2.7%, respectively. In 2 studies, 
human bocavirus and human parechovirus were detected in 21.8% and 23.7% of
children with acute gastroenteritis, respectively.
