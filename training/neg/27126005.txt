OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to identify the most effective
cervical cancer screening algorithm incorporating different combinations of
cytology, HPV testing and genotyping.
METHODS: Women 25-55years old recruited for the "HERMES" (HEllenic Real life
Multicentric cErvical Screening) study were screened in terms of cytology and
high-risk (hr) HPV testing with HPV 16/18 genotyping. Women positive for cytology
or/and hrHPV were referred for colposcopy, biopsy and treatment. Ten screening
algorithms based on different combinations of cytology, HPV testing and HPV 16/18
genotyping were investigated in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
RESULTS: Three clusters of algorithms were formed according to the balance
between effectiveness and harm caused by screening. The cluster showing the best 
balance included two algorithms based on co-testing and two based on HPV primary 
screening with HPV 16/18 genotyping. Among these, hrHPV testing with HPV 16/18
genotyping and reflex cytology (atypical squamous cells of undetermined
significance - ASCUS threshold) presented the optimal combination of sensitivity 
(82.9%) and specificity relative to cytology alone (0.99) with 1.26 false
positive rate relative to cytology alone.
CONCLUSION: HPV testing with HPV 16/18 genotyping, referring HPV 16/18 positive
women directly to colposcopy, and hrHPV (non 16/18) positive women to reflex
cytology (ASCUS threshold), as a triage method to colposcopy, reflects the best
equilibrium between screening effectiveness and harm. Algorithms, based on
cytology as initial screening method, on co-testing or HPV primary without
genotyping, and on HPV primary with genotyping but without cytology triage, are
not supported according to the present analysis.
