CMV reactivation is a major complication after allogeneic stem cell
transplantation (SCT). Immune reconstitution of CMV-specific CTLs (CMV-CTLs) is
essential for virus control. During CMV-CTL monitoring using mutated HLA/CMV
tetramers selectively detecting high-avidity T cells, we observed coappearance of
CMV-CTLs with low (CMV tetlow CTLs) and high tetramer binding (CMV tethigh CTLs) 
in 53/115 CMV IgG+ patients stem cell transplanted from CMV IgG+ donors. However,
the relevance of these coappearing differentially tetramer binding ("dual")
CMV-CTLs was unclear. In this study, we investigated the kinetics, properties,
and clinical impact of coappearing CMV tetlow and tethigh CTLs after allogeneic
SCT. Patients with dual CMV-CTLs had more CMV tethigh than tetlow CTLs. Chimerism
analysis of isolated CMV tetlow and tethigh CTLs revealed their exclusive donor
origin. CMV tetlow and tethigh CTLs had an identical effector memory CD45RA-CCR7-
and CD45RA+CCR7- T cell distribution, equal differentiation, senescence, and
exhaustion marker expression and were negative for regulatory CD8+ T cell
markers. Isolated CMV tetlow and tethigh CTLs were equally sensitive to CMV
peptides in IFN-γ release and cytotoxicity assays. However, CMV tethigh CTLs
proliferated more in response to low CMV peptide concentrations than tetlow CTLs.
TCR repertoire analysis revealed that CMV tetlow and tethigh CTLs use different
TCRs. Finally, dual CMV-CTLs were not associated with CMV antigenemia. In
conclusion, these data show for the first time, to our knowledge, that both CMV
tetlow and tethigh CTLs are functional effector T cells differing by
proliferation, numbers in peripheral blood, and probably by their precursors
without increasing the CMV reactivation risk after allogeneic SCT.
