Efficient inhibition of the HIV infection life cycle at the stages of viral
infection, reverse transcription, and post-translational processing has been
extensively studied. However, efficient inhibition of HIV assembly and budding
has not been reported. Here, we report that dendritic cell-specific intercellular
adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) -grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and its related
protein, DC-SIGNR, effectively block HIV budding from infected cells.
Cotransfection of DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR with HIV demonstrated 95-99.5% inhibition
of viral production from host cells. DC-SIGN or DC-SIGNR can also effectively
inhibit 90-95% of HIV generation from infected cells. DC-SIGN efficiently reduces
the amount of gp120 present on the cell plasma membrane, and completely strips
off gp120 from the virions produced by the host cells, suggesting that blockage
of HIV budding is due to internalization of gp120 by DC-SIGN.
