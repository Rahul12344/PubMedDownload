Background: Based on a retrospective study performed at our institution, 38% of
inpatients living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were found to have a
medication error involving their anti-retroviral (ARV) and/or opportunistic
infection (OI) prophylaxis medications.
Objective: To determine the impact of a dedicated HIV-trained clinical pharmacist
on the ARV and OI prophylaxis medication error rates at our institution.
Methods: A prospective quality improvement project was conducted over a six month
period to assess the impact of a dedicated HIV-trained clinical pharmacist on the
ARV and OI prophylaxis medication error rates. IRB approval received.
Results: There were 144 patients included in this analysis, who experienced a
combined 76 medication errors. Compared to historical control study conducted at 
our institution, the percent of patients who experienced a medication error
remained stable (38% vs. 39%, respectively) and the error rate per patient was
similar (1.44 vs. 1.36, p=NS). The percent of medication errors that were
corrected prior to discharge increased from 24% to 70% and the median time to
error correction decreased from 42 hours to 11.5 hours (p<0.0001).
Conclusions: Errors relating to ARV or OI prophylaxis medications remain frequent
in inpatient people living with HIV/AIDS. After multiple interventions were
implemented, ARV and OI prophylaxis medication errors were corrected faster and
with greater frequency prior to discharge, however, similar rates of errors for
patients existed. Dedicated HIV clinicians with adequate training and
credentialing are necessary to manage this specialized disease state and to
reduce the overall number of medication errors associated with HIV/AIDS.
