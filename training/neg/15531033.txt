Filamentous phage display systems have been developed successfully to generate
functional Fab antibody fragments. In this study, a recombinant Fab antibody
fragment was successfully cloned from a murine monoclonal antibody 2H2 that can
effectively neutralize Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in vitro. The
recombinant Fab 2H2 antibody fragment expressed in Escherichia coli using the
pComb3H phage vector resulted in a dose-dependent neutralization response using
plaque reduction neutralization test. Molecular modeling of the Fab 2H2 indicated
that the rational contact residues of the Fab 2H2 were targeted to the lateral
surface of domain III of the JEV E protein. The combining sites of Fab 2H2 were
mostly located at the variable region of the heavy chain genes. In vitro
shuffling of the heavy-chain variable genes using pCom3H phage technology
indicated that the sequence analysis of 10 high-affinity clones selected from the
self-shuffling libraries presented no change in their amino acid sequences in
6CDRs, suggesting that the Fab 2H2 had evolved to be highly matured in the
combining sites to the lateral surface of domain III. The information gained from
this study may benefit the design of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 
JEV infection.
