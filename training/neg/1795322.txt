In a 10-month prospective study a research assistant identified 411 patients with
rheumatic disease at the 2 referral hospitals in Harare. Rheumatic disease
accounted for less than 1% of hospital admissions. Rheumatoid arthritis, the
commonest condition, accounted for 18% of patients, many of whom had impaired
functional capacity. Septic arthritis (16%) was common in younger patients, often
affecting the hip or knee and often associated with other complications of
disseminated staphylococcal infection. Osteoarthritis (9%), rheumatic fever (7%),
gout (6%), human immunodeficiency virus associated musculoskeletal problems (6%) 
and systemic lupus erythematosus (5%) were relatively common while the
spondyloarthropathies occurred less frequently. The spectrum of rheumatic disease
seen in teaching hospitals in Harare, although significantly different from that 
seen in Europe and North America, approximates the pattern seen in developed
countries more closely than previous studies from Africa would suggest.
