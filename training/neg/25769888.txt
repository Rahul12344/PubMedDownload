Diagnosing asymptomatic neurosyphilis (ANS) in HIV-infected patients is
difficult. A recent report suggested that CXCL13 is a promising diagnostic marker
for neurosyphilis in HIV-positive patients. However, whether CXCL13 can be a
diagnostic marker for ANS in HIV-infected patients remains unknown. The purpose
of our study was to determine the role of CXCL13 in diagnosing ANS in
HIV-infected patients. This study comprised two study and three control groups.
Two study groups included 12 HIV-infected patients with ANS and 25 patients with 
syphilis and HIV co-infection (without ANS). Three control groups included 9
patients with ANS without HIV infection, 25 HIV-infected patients without
syphilis and 10 healthy volunteers. Concentrations of CSF CXCL13 were measured
before and after neurosyphilis therapy. Our results showed that CSF CXCL13
concentrations were significantly increased in all of the HIV-infected patients
with ANS, the 25 HIV patients with syphilis and the 9 ANS patients without HIV,
but not in the patients of the other two control groups. CSF CXCL13
concentrations declined in the two study groups of patients following
neurosyphilis therapy. Therefore, CSF CXCL13 concentrations could improve the
diagnosis of ANS in HIV-infected patients.
