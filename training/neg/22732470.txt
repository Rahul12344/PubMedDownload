BACKGROUND: More than half of the persons living with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV; PLWH) in the US smoke cigarettes, and tobacco use is responsible for 
considerable morbidity and mortality in this group. Little is known about the
efficacy of tobacco treatment strategies in PLWH.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial comparing Positively Smoke Free (PSF), an
intensive group-therapy intervention targeting HIV-infected smokers, to standard 
care.
METHODS: A cohort of 145 PLWH smokers, recruited from an HIV-care center in the
Bronx, New York, were randomized 1:1 into the PSF program or standard care. All
were offered a 3-month supply of nicotine replacement therapy. PSF is an
8-session program tailored to address the needs and concerns of HIV-infected
smokers. The sessions were cofacilitated by a graduate student and an
HIV-infected peer. The primary outcome was biochemically confirmed, 7-day
point-prevalence abstinence at 3 months.
RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, PSF condition subjects had nearly
double the quit rate of controls (19.2% vs. 9.7%, P = 0.11). In the complete
case, as-treated analysis, assignment to PSF was associated with increased odds
of quitting (odds ratio(adj) 3.55, 95% confidence interval 1.04 to 12.0). Latino 
ethnicity and lower loneliness score were predictive of abstinence. The subjects 
in the PSF condition exhibited significant decreases in daily cigarette
consumption and significant increases in self-efficacy and in motivation to quit.
Attendance of â‰¥7 sessions was associated with higher quit rates.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a positive effect of PSF on cessation rates
in PLWH smokers. Loneliness and self-efficacy are influential factors in the
smoking behaviors of PLWH.
