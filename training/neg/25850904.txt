The relationship between risk of death following influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection
and ethnicity and deprivation during the 2009/2010 pandemic period and the first 
post-pandemic season of 2010/2011 in England was examined. Poisson regression
models were used to estimate the mortality risk, adjusted for age, gender, and
place of residence. Those of non-White ethnicity experienced an increased
mortality risk compared to White populations during the 2009/2010 pandemic
[10·5/1000 vs. 6·0/1000 general population; adjusted risk ratio (RR) 1·84, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1·39-2·54] with the highest risk in those of Pakistani
ethnicity. However, no significant difference between ethnicities was observed
during the following 2010/2011 season. Persons living in areas with the highest
level of deprivation had a significantly higher risk of death (RR 2·08, 95% CI
1·49-2·91) compared to the lowest level for both periods. These results highlight
the importance of rapid identification of groups at higher risk of severe disease
in the early stages of future pandemics to enable the implementation of optimal
prevention and control measures for vulnerable populations.
