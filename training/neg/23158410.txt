Mosquito-borne Sindbis virus (SINV) causes rash-arthritis syndrome in Finland.
Major outbreaks with approximately 7-year cycles have caused substantial burden
of illness. Forest dwelling grouse are suspected to be amplifying hosts, with the
infection transmitted to humans by mosquito bites. SINV infection surveillance
data for 1984–2010 were used to create a negative binomial hurdle model, with
seasonality, long-term cycles, climatic, ecological and socioeconomic variables. 
Climatic factors during early summer and amount of snow in April described the
occurrence and incidence of SINV infections. Regulated water shore and hatch-year
black grouse density described the occurrence, while population working in
agriculture, agricultural land(negative) and income (negative) described the
incidence of the disease. The prediction for 2009 was 85 cases (95% prediction
interval 2-1187), while the actual occurrence was 106. We identified novel and
known risk factors. The prevention of SINV infections in regulated water areas by
infected mosquito populations should be targeted.
