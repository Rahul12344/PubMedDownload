The ongoing Ebola outbreak poses an alarming risk to the countries of West Africa
and beyond. On August 8, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the
cross-country Ebola outbreak a Public Emergency of International Concern. China
has had no confirmed cases of Ebola. In this paper, virologic characteristics,
pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, laboratory examination and prophylactic
vaccines and therapeutic drugs of Ebola are summarized. Importantly, active
responses and actions from China are introduced. Moreover, the key issues in the 
future prevention and control of Ebola were also addressed.
