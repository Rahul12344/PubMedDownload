Double-stranded poliovirus RNA inhibits initiation of protein synthesis by
reticulocyte lysates.

Ehrenfeld E, Hunt T.

Infection of HeLa cells with poliovirus results in an inhibition of host-cell
protein synthesis. Cytoplasmic extracts from infected cells contian an activity
that inhibits initiation of protein synthesis in vitro by rabbit reticulocyte
lysates. This inhibitory activity has been purified and characterized, and is
shown to reside in poliovirus double-stranded RNA. The intact double-stranded
molecule is not essential for inhibitory activity.
