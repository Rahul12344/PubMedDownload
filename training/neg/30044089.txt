Photodynamic Polymers as Comprehensive Anti-Infective Materials: Staying Ahead of
a Growing Global Threat.

Peddinti BST, Scholle F, Ghiladi RA, Spontak RJ.

To combat the global threat posed by surface-adhering pathogens that are becoming
increasingly drug-resistant, we explore the anti-infective efficacy of bulk
thermoplastic elastomer films containing âˆ¼1 wt % zinc-tetra(4-
N-methylpyridyl)porphine (ZnTMPyP4+), a photoactive antimicrobial that utilizes
visible light to generate singlet oxygen. This photodynamic polymer is capable of
inactivating five bacterial strains and two viruses with at least 99.89% and
99.95% success, respectively, after exposure to noncoherent light for 60 min.
Unlike other anti-infective methodologies commonly requiring oxidizing chemicals,
carcinogenic radiation, or toxic nanoparticles, our approach is nonspecific and
safe/nontoxic, and sustainably relies on the availability of just oxygen and
visible light.
