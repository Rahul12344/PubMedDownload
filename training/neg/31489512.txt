PURPOSE: To describe knowledge about human papillomavirus (HPV), HPV-related care
behavior, and advocacy intent (e.g., vaccine recommendation and willingness to
become an advocate for vaccination) and to investigate associations between
knowledge, HPV-related care behavior, and advocacy intent among HPV-related
cancer survivors.
METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was offered through Qualtrics to
HPV-related cancer survivors who were either volunteers at a cancer center or
patients of survivorship clinics.
RESULTS: A total of 200 survivors responded. Only 33.2% of respondents reported
knowing their cancer was HPV-related and 56.8% reported HPV vaccine is safe.
Participants who knew that their cancer was caused by HPV were more likely to
have vaccinated their children (p < .001). Also, participants who knew that the
vaccine is safe were more willing to recommend the vaccine (p < .001), to be a
peer mentor for others with HPV-related cancers (43.2% vs. 14.0%, p < .001), and 
to act as an advocate for increasing vaccination rates (44.1% vs. 24.4%,
p = 0.01). Finally, survivors who were aware of the vaccine's effectiveness in
decreasing precancerous lesions were more likely to recommend the vaccine (45.7% 
vs. 12.0%, p = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Raising survivor awareness of the link between HPV and cancer and
HPV vaccine safety may increase their willingness to serve as powerful opinion
leaders and peer mentors to promote HPV vaccination. Providers may take the
simple step of informing patients that their cancer is HPV-related and HPV
vaccine is safe to increase the number of informed and empowered survivors.
