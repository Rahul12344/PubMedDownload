Formation of a macromolecular complex between the RNA binding protein HIV-1 Rev
and HIV-1 mRNA is an essential prerequisite for nuclear export and subsequent
expression of HIV-1 mRNA. The arginine rich peptide TRQARRNRRRRWRARQR,
corresponding to residues 34-50 of HIV-1 Rev, contains the mRNA binding motif. We
prepared a thioether linked Rev34-50-cellulose conjugate to affinity purify a
fragment of synthetic mRNA corresponding to the high affinity binding site for
Rev. The correctly folded fraction of mRNA (27.5%) was isolated from a crude
synthetic mixture.
