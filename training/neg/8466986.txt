An influenza virus, A/equine/Alaska/1/91 (H3N8), was isolated from horses from
Alaska with an acute respiratory infection. Pathogenic and serologic studies
revealed that this virus is similar to previously isolated equine H3N8 influenza 
viruses. Antigenic analyses utilizing hemagglutination inhibition and
neuraminidase inhibition assays indicated an antigenic drift from the prototype
equine H3N8 influenza virus, A/equine/Miami/1/63. Partial sequence analysis of
the A/equine/Alaska influenza virus indicated that each of 8 gene sequences are
of equine origin.
