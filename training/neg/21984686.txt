BACKGROUND: In addition to activities needed to catalyse integration, retroviral 
integrases exhibit non-specific endonuclease activity that is enhanced by certain
small compounds, suggesting that integrase could be stimulated to damage viral
DNA before integration occurs.
METHODS: A non-radioactive, plate-based, solution phase, fluorescence assay was
used to screen a library of 50,080 drug-like chemicals for stimulation of
non-specific DNA nicking by HIV-1 integrase.
RESULTS: A semi-automated workflow was established and primary hits were readily 
identified from a graphic output. Overall, 0.6% of the chemicals caused a large
increase in fluorescence (the primary hit rate) without also having visible
colour that could have artifactually caused this result. None of the potential
stimulators from this moderate-size library, however, passed a secondary test
that included an inactive integrase mutant that assessed whether the increased
fluorescence depended on the endonuclease activity of integrase.
CONCLUSIONS: This first attempt at identifying integrase stimulator compounds
establishes the necessary logistics and workflow required. The results from this 
study should encourage larger scale high-throughput screening to advance the
novel antiviral strategy of stimulating integrase to damage retroviral DNA.
