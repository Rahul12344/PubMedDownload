The duration of viral shedding in the patients from two outbreaks and four
sporadic cases of norovirus (NoV) infections was investigated. The longest period
of viral shedding into feces was for 173 days in an inpatient from one case of
outbreak. The VP1 sequence from two long-term viral shedding cases in the
outbreak revealed four synonymous and one non-synonymous mutations in one
inpatient at 26 days from the onset of illness, and nine synonymous and two
non-synonymous mutations and a deletion, 10 synonymous mutations and a deletion
in other inpatient at 29 days and 54 days from the onset of illness,
respectively. Ten of the 11 amino acid positions detected in these two inpatients
were in the outermost P2 domain of the viral capsid protein, and mutations at
positions 295, 297, and 394 were shared in the inpatients. Mutations in the P2
domain were in epitopes A and D or near epitopes A, C, and E, suggesting that the
long-term carrier state of norovirus infection contributes to the generation of
escape mutants by host immunoselection.
