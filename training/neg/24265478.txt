BACKGROUND: Most reports about respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in developing
countries rely on sentinel surveillance, from which population incidence is
difficult to infer. We used the proportion of RSV infections from
population-based surveillance with data from a healthcare utilization survey to
produce estimates of RSV incidence in Damanhour district, Egypt.
METHODS: We conducted population-based surveillance in 3 hospitals (2009-2012)
and 3 outpatient clinics (2011-2012) in Damanhour district. Nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal specimens from hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness
and outpatients with influenza-like illness were tested by real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for RSV. We also conducted a healthcare
utilization survey in 2011-2012 to determine the proportion of individuals who
sought care for respiratory illness.
RESULTS: Among 5342 hospitalized patients and 771 outpatients, 12% and 5% tested 
positive for RSV, respectively. The incidence of RSV-associated hospitalization
and outpatient visits was estimated at 24 and 608 (per 100 000 person-years),
respectively. Children aged <1 year experienced the highest incidence of
RSV-associated hospitalizations (1745/100 000 person-years).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the utility of combining a healthcare
utilization survey and population-based surveillance data to estimate disease
incidence. Estimating incidence and outcomes of RSV disease is critical to
establish the burden of RSV in Egypt.
