A 79-year-old woman was admitted on January 18, 2000, with a lumbar compression
fracture. Two days after admission, a chest X-ray film showed reticular
infiltrates in the right lung field. She was diagnosed as having pneumonia and
was treated with antibiotics. Despite this therapy, her symptoms did not improve 
and the infiltrates diffusely extended to involve both lungs on chest X-ray
films. She was placed on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for
progressive respiratory failure at 5 days after admission in order to avoid
endotracheal intubation. Her hypoxemia was immediately improved by oronasal
bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) and chest X-ray films
revealed improvement of the reticular infiltrates. Measurement of viral antibody 
titers showed that the cause of acute respiratory failure was influenza A virus
pneumonia. In conclusion, NIPPV may reduce the need for intubation of elderly
patients with acute respiratory failure, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) patients.
