tpl-2 is a rat gene that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that can act
as a novel mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase. Tpl-2 is
activated in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat T lymphomas, due to a
truncation in the C-terminal region of the protein. cot is a very closely related
gene, if not the human homologue. The truncated form of Cot has been shown to
have a higher transforming activity than the nontruncated form. In this paper we 
show that an increase in truncated Cot kinase expression correlates with an
increase in IL-2 production in anti-CD3-treated Jurkat cells. Truncated Cot
expression also cooperates with PHA or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and
calcium ionophore for IL-2 production in Jurkat cells. Both the truncated and
nontruncated Cot forms increased IL-2 transcription because they enhanced
transcription of a reporter gene linked to the IL-2 promoter. The expression of a
dominant negative form of Cot inhibits transcription directed by the IL-2
promoter in Jurkat cells stimulated by PDBu and ionophore. These data suggest a
role of Tpl-2/Cot kinase in IL-2 production during T lymphocyte activation and
could also explain its role in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced
lymphomagenesis.
