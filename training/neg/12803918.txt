Numerous cell membrane associated processes, including signal transduction,
membrane sorting, protein processing and virus trafficking take place in membrane
subdomains. Protein-protein interactions provide the frameworks necessary to
generate biologically functional membrane domains. For example, coat proteins
define membrane areas destined for sorting processes, viral proteins
self-assemble to generate a budding virus, and adapter molecules organize
multimolecular signalling assemblies, which catalyse downstream reactions. The
concept of raft lipid-based membrane domains provides a different principle for
compartmentalization and segregation of membrane constituents. Accordingly, rafts
are defined by the physical properties of the lipid bilayer and function by
selective partitioning of membrane lipids and proteins into membrane domains of
specific phase behaviour and lipid packing. Here, I will discuss the interplay of
these independent principles of protein scaffolds and raft lipid microdomains
leading to the generation of biologically functional membrane domains.
