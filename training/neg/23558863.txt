In the context of a study of the involvement of SND1 (also known as coactivator
p100) in biliary lipid secretion by primary rat hepatocytes, first-generation
adenoviral vectors were used to promote the overexpression and underexpression of
the protein SND1. Although differential expression of SND1 did not result in
significant changes in the processes studied, some effects of the adenoviral
infection itself were observed. In particular, infected hepatocytes showed a
higher intracellular taurocholate accumulation capacity. Additionally, small
heterodimer partner (SHP) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which are nuclear
receptors essential for the regulation of bile salt metabolism and transport,
were underregulated at the mRNA level. Our results suggest that adenoviral
vectors could be altering some important control mechanism and indicate that
adenoviral vectors should be used with caution as transfection vectors for
hepatocytes when biliary lipid metabolism is to be studied.
