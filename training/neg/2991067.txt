An epidemic of hepatitis A occurred around Hondo City, Kumamoto Prefecture in
Japan during the first six months of 1982. Clinical, immunological and
epidemiological studies were carried out in 225 cases. Cases were distributed
over a relatively wide area, and in small numbers of young children and school
children. More than half of the patients were in their twenties or thirties. The 
clinical course was generally favorable with rapid resolution. No episode lasted 
more than six months. There was only one fatality in a cure which was a carrier
of HBs antigen with liver cirrhosis. Titers of IgM anti-HAV measured by
radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) reached a peak during the
second week after onset, followed by a gradual decrease. Conversion to negative
results was never experienced within two months. We found a good correlation
between RIA and EIA in terms of detecting IgM anti-HAV. The route of infection
was thought to be fecal-oral in nature, with ingestion of raw oysters the major
etiologic factor.
