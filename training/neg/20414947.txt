Retroviruses have been found in many bird and animal species where they often
cause various types of cancer. Dr. Robert Gallo's contribution to the field of
retrovirology and the link he established between RNA viruses and cancer has been
significant. Historical aspects of his discoveries in the area of human
retroviruses are presented and an attempt is made to focus attention on his
outstanding role.
