Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are nonpathogenic, nonenveloped, single-stranded 
DNA viruses in development as gene therapy vectors. AAV internalization was
postulated to proceed via a dynamin-dependent endocytic mechanism. Revisiting
this, we find that infectious endocytosis of the prototypical AAV, AAV2, is
independent of clathrin, caveolin, and dynamin. AAV2 infection is sensitive to
EIPA, a fluid-phase uptake inhibitor, but is unaffected by Rac1 mutants or other 
macropinocytosis inhibitors. In contrast, AAV2 infection requires actin
cytoskeleton remodeling and membrane cholesterol and is sensitive to inhibition
of Cdc42, Arf1, and GRAF1, factors known to be involved in the formation of
clathrin-independent carriers (CLIC). AAV2 virions are internalized in the
detergent-resistant GPI-anchored-protein-enriched endosomal compartment (GEEC)
and translocated to the Golgi apparatus, similarly to the CLIC/GEEC marker
cholera toxin B. Our results indicate that-unlike the viral entry mechanisms
described so far-AAV2 uses the pleiomorphic CLIC/GEEC pathway as its major
endocytic infection route.
