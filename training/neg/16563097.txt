Cancer is thought to arise as a consequence of multiple insults to a cell.
Mutations that lead to increased expression or activity of proto-oncogenes or
decreased expression of tumor suppressors are common insults that have been
identified to date. However, when considering tumor viruses, viral proteins that 
modify cellular gene expression, alter host immune surveillance, or affect
signaling pathways are also common players. Notably, several of these tumor
viruses encode proteins containing an immunoreceptor-associated tyrosine-based
activation motif (ITAM), a signaling motif recently implicated in epithelial cell
oncogenesis. As expression of proteins bearing this motif is normally restricted 
to hematopoietic cells, recent work highlighting the consequences of ITAM
expression in epithelial cells suggests it may play a role in solid tumor
formation.
