The secondary structure of the isolated tRNA-like sequence (n=159) present at the
3' OH terminus of turnip yellow mosaic virus RNA has been established from
partial nuclease digestion with S1 nuclease and T1, CL(3), and Naja oxiana
RNases. The fragment folds into a 6-armed structure with two main domains. The
first domain, of loose structure and nearest the 5' OH terminus, is composed of
one large arm which extends into the coat protein cistron. The second, more
compact domain, is composed of the five other arms and most probably contains the
structure recognized by valyl-tRNA synthetase. In this domain three successive
arms strikingly resemble the T[unk], anticodon, and D arms found in tRNA. Near
the amino-acid accepting terminus, however, there is a new stem and loop region
not found in standard tRNA. This secondary structure is compatible with a
L-shaped three-dimensional organization in which the corner of the L and the
anticodon-containing limb are similar to, and the amino-acid accepting region
different from, that in tRNA. Ethylnitrosourea accessibility studies have shown
similar tertiary structure features in the T[unk] loop of tRNA and in the
homologous region of the viral RNA.
