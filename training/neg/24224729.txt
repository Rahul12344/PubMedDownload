By reducing the basicity of the core heterocycle in a series of HCV NS5B
inhibitors, the hERG liability was reduced. The SAR was then systematically
explored in order to increase solubility and enable dose escalation while
retaining potency. During this exploration, a facile decarboxylation was noted
and was exploited as a novel prodrug mechanism. The synthesis and
characterization of these prodrugs and their utilization in chronic toxicity
studies are presented.
