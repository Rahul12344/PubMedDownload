Viral infections can play direct or indirect roles in the etiology of the bovine 
mastitis. Mx dynamin-like GTPase 2 (MX2) gene is a main effector of the antiviral
innate immune defense mediated by type I interferon (IFN I), which was
demonstrated to confer positive antiviral responses to many viruses. Given the
importance of the MX2 in modulating the host immune response, MX2 gene may be a
suitable candidate gene for studying disease resistance in dairy cattle. Here, we
scanned the sequence variation of the MX2 gene in Chinese indigenous cattle
breeds. Twenty-three previously reported SNPs were identified. To further analyze
the effects of SNPs detected on mastitis disease, analysis of two SNPs (g.787527 
C > T and g.787610 T > C) from 297 Chinese Holstein cows revealed a significant
association with somatic cell score (SCS). Although functional studies are
necessary to ascertain whether these two SNPs are causal polymorphisms or merely 
in linkage with the true causal SNPs, implementation of these two SNPs as genetic
markers in the dairy industry may be beneficial in selecting individuals with
lower SCS.
