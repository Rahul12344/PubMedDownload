A chimeric tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) A component DNA, which results from 
replacement of the coding region of the viral coat protein gene (CP) with the
larger bacterial beta-glucuronidase coding sequence (GUS), can replicate in
agroinoculated leaf discs but is unstable in systemically infected plants (1). We
have made similar replacements of the TGMV CP gene with the GUS coding sequence
in both the sense and antisense orientations. Both derivatives replicated in leaf
discs inoculated via Agrobacterium. However, systemic movement of the GUS
substituted vectors was not detected in agroinoculated Nicotiana benthamiana
plants. The only TGMV A derivatives detected in systemically infected leaves of
inoculated plants were similar in size to the wild type viral component. Sequence
analysis of derivatives from six independently inoculated plants revealed that
they did not result from internal deletions of the larger replicons detected in
leaf discs but, instead, were generated by fusion events occuring within the
original T-DNA insert. These results indicate that systemic movement of TGMV in
N. benthamiana plants provides a strong selective pressure favoring viral
derivatives similar in size to the wild type virus components.
