The combination of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and pregnancy
presents unique management questions. Aspects of care that need to be considered 
include effects of hepatitis B on pregnancy, effects of pregnancy itself on the
course of hepatitis B infection, treatment of hepatitis B during pregnancy and
prevention of mother-to-infant transmission. Chronic HBV infection is usually
mild in pregnant women, but may flare shortly after delivery. Effect of HBV
infection on pregnancy outcomes are generally favorable, but may depend on
severity of liver disease. Mother-to-infant transmission can be minimized by
current immunoprophylaxis strategies, however, high levels of viremia in mothers 
may be a factor in the small but reproducible failure rate of current
immunoprophylaxis strategies. Use of antivirals during pregnancy needs to be
individualized. Careful planning and management of pregnancy must be done among
patients with chronic HBV infection.
