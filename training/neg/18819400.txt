Examination of 1898 patients with acute enteric infection from March 2005 to
February 2007 showed that group A rotaviruses were the most frequent cause (35%) 
of acute gastroenteritis among children under 3 years of age. Majority of cases
of rotavirus infection was detected in infants under 1 year of age (71.8%). The
peak of sporadic incidence was observed between February and May. High rate of
mixed infection (45.6%) was observed - associations of rotaviruses with other
viruses (noroviruses, astroviruses) and bacteria (Salmonella, Shigella,
enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, and opportunistic species) were
detected. P- and G-genotypes of 337(50.8%) isolates of group A rotaviruses were
determined by RT-PCR. The most prevalent strain was P[8]G1 (54.6%) followed by
P[8]G3 (10.7%), P[8]G9 (8.6%), P[4]G2 (8.3%), and P[8]G4 (4.5%) genotypes.
