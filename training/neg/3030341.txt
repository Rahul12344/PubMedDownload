Lymphomas occurred in 3 of 16 Japanese patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT)
and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). The patients had a persistently reactivated
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection with a remarkable decrease in virus-specific
cellular immunity. In these patients, the B lymphocytes were more sensitive to
EBV-induced events and to cellular proto-oncogene activation than seen in the
healthy counterparts. This immunologic and genetic background was considered to
explain the massive lymphoproliferation in these primary immunodeficiency
disorders.
