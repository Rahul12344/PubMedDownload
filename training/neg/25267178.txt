The genome sequence of tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV, a subgroup C nepovirus) is
currently available for one raspberry isolate. In this study, we describe the
complete genome sequence of three additional isolates from raspberry
(Rasp1-2014), grapevine (GYV-2014) and prunus (13C280). The degree of nucleotide 
sequence identity shared between RNA1 and RNA2 in the 5'-terminal 900 nucleotides
and 3' untranslated region varied from 98-99 % (13C280, GYV-2014) to 80 %
(Rasp1-2014). Phylogenetic studies revealed distinct origins for Rasp1-2014 RNA1 
and RNA2, suggesting reassortment. Two recombination events were also identified 
in the 3' UTR and 5'-terminal region of RNA1.
