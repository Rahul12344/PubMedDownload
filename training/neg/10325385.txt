While an increasing number of studies suggest that there is a high prevalence of 
rotaviruses with P8[11], a typical P type of bovine rotavirus (BRV), among human 
neonates or infants in India, no data are available on the distribution of G and 
P types of Indian BRVs. Thus, fecal specimens were collected from cow and buffalo
calves under 1 month of age on organized dairy farms in India during the period
between 1994 and 1997, and 36 rotavirus-positive specimens were used to determine
the relative frequencies of the G and P types of Indian BRVs. As to the G type,
G10 was predominant (83%), followed by G6 (6%). The majority (94%) of BRVs had
P8[11], and only one isolate possessed P6[1]. The most common combination of G
and P types was G10P8[11] (81%), followed by G6P6[1] (3%) and G6P8[11] (3%). The 
high prevalence of BRVs possessing P8[11] VP4s strongly supports the hypothesis
that BRVs may cross the host species barrier and circulate among neonates in
India.
