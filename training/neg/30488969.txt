Viral nervous necrosis (VNN) affects more than 120 species mostly belonging to
the order Perciformes. However, none of the brackishwater species belonging to
the family Cichlidae under the order Perciformes are reported to be susceptible. 
Hence, the present experiment was undertaken to study the susceptibility of the
brackishwater cichlid, pearlspot, Etroplus suratensis to NNV. Thirty-day-old
pearlspot larvae were infected with NNV by immersion. Mortality was recorded till
14 days post-infection, and the infected larvae were subjected to nested RT-PCR
and histology. The virus was isolated from infected larvae using SSN-1 cells. To 
study the replication of the virus in vitro, primary cultured brain cells of
E. suratensis and IEK cells were infected with NNV. No mortality was observed in 
any of the control or experimentally infected larvae. However, the experimentally
infected larvae were positive for NNV by nested RT-PCR and the virus was isolated
using SSN-1 cells. Further, the infected pearlspot brain cells and IEK cells
showed cytopathic effect at second and third passage of the virus and they were
positive for NNV by nested RT-PCR. Pearlspot is relatively resistant to VNN
although the virus could replicate in the larvae and in cell culture.
