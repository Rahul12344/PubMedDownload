SARM (Sterile alpha and armadillo motif-containing protein) is the recently
identified TIR domain-containing cytosolic protein. Classified as a member of the
TLR adaptor family, the multiple locations and functions of SARM (sometimes
playing opposing roles), provoke an enigma on its biology. Although originally
assumed to be a member of the TLR adaptor family (functioning as a negative
regulator of TLR signaling pathway), latest findings indicate that SARM regulates
signaling differently from other TLR adaptor proteins. Recent studies have
highlighted the significant functional role of SARM in mediating apoptosis and
antiviral innate immune response. In this review, we provide an update on the
evolutionary conservation, spatial distribution, and regulated expression of SARM
to highlight its diverse functional roles. The review will summarize findings on 
the known interacting partners of SARM and provide analogy on how they add new
dimensions to the current understanding on the multifaceted roles of SARM in
antiviral activities and apoptotic functions. In addition, we provide a future
perspective on the roles of SARM in differentiation and development, with
substantial emphasis on the molecular insights to its mechanisms of action.
