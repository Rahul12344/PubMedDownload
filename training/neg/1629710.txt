Attachment of hepatitis B virus to a hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) was
examined using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the pre-S1 (21-47) region of 
the envelope protein. Scatchard analysis revealed a single class binding site of 
Kd 104 +/- 27 nM/l and 5.4 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) sites per cell. Competition of HBV
with pre-S1 peptides was dose dependent, and demonstrated it as the dominant
binding site. In view of the suggested sequence homology between the peptide and 
IgA, cross-competition studies were carried out. The results indicate no direct
role of IgA receptor in HBV binding. The receptor for the pre-S1 peptide was
identified as a single major peptide of molecular weight 31 kD using in-situ
ligand receptor crosslinking.
