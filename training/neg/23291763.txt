Molecular diversity within six viroid species and different molecular variants,
in each species infecting fruit trees was first estimated by the single-strand
conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique and then by direct sequencing
analysis. The different variants studied are to three Australian grapevine
viroids(AGVd), four citrus dwarfing viroids (CDVd), eleven grapevine yellow
speckle viroids type-1 (GYSVd-1), four hop stunt viroids (HSVd), seven peach
latent mosaic viroids (PLMVd), and eight pear blister canker viroids (PBCVd).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) conditions were compared and optimized 
to improve the sensitivity of the existing SSCP parameters. The relationships
among the various SSCP profiles observed and the variation in nucleotide
sequences was studied. The results indicate that the variations of some
parameters of electrophoresis for each species allowed higher resolution and
hence detection of single nucleotide variations among clones initially clustered 
into the same group.
