Since the introduction of mandatory HCV RNA testing of plasma pools for
fractionation by nucleic acid amplification technology, we have organised
External Quality Assessment studies (EQAs) addressed to blood products
manufacturers and blood centres. Here we report the results of a new EQA, the
first one to include all six major HCV genotypes. The results, reported by
laboratories worldwide, showed that genotypes 1, 2 and 3 were correctly
identified in 100% of the tests, genotype 4 in 96.7% and genotypes 5 and 6 in
98.3% of the assays. As detection of all HCV genotypes is critical for
laboratories involved in testing plasma for HCV, all six genotypes should
continue to be included in the next EQA studies.
