Dried blood spots (DBS) can be used in developing countries to alleviate the
logistic constraints of using blood plasma specimens for viral load (VL) and HIV 
drug resistance (HIVDR) testing, but they should be assessed under field
conditions. Between 2009 and 2011, we collected paired plasma-DBS samples from
treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected adults in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Senegal,
Togo, Thailand, and Vietnam. The DBS were stored at an ambient temperature for 2 
to 4 weeks and subsequently at -20°C before testing. VL testing was performed on 
the plasma samples and DBS using locally available methods: the Abbott m2000rt
HIV-1 test, generic G2 real-time PCR, or the NucliSENS EasyQ version 1.2 test. In
the case of virological failure (VF), i.e., a plasma VL of ≥1,000 copies/ml,
HIVDR genotyping was performed on paired plasma-DBS samples. Overall, we compared
382 plasma-DBS sample pairs for DBS VL testing accuracy. The sensitivities of the
different assays in different laboratories for detecting VF using DBS varied from
75% to 100% for the m2000rt test in labs B, C, and D, 91% to 93% for generic G2
real-time PCR in labs A and F, and 85% for the NucliSENS test in lab E. The
specificities varied from 82% to 97% for the m2000rt and NucliSENS tests and
reached only 60% for the generic G2 test. The NucliSENS test showed good
agreement between plasma and DBS VL but underestimated the DBS VL. The lowest
agreement was observed for the generic G2 test. Genotyping was successful for
96/124 (77%) DBS tested, and 75/96 (78%) plasma-DBS pairs had identical HIVDR
mutations. Significant discrepancies in resistance interpretations were observed 
in 9 cases, 6 of which were from the same laboratory. DBS can be successfully
used as an alternative to blood plasma samples for routine VL and HIVDR
monitoring in African and Asian settings. However, the selection of an adequate
VL measurement method and the definition of the VF threshold should be
considered, and laboratory performance should be monitored.
