Although pharmacologic therapies have provided gains in reducing the mortality of
heart failure, the rising incidence of the disease requires new approaches to
combat its health burden. Twenty-five years ago, abnormal calcium cycling was
identified as a characteristic of failing human myocardium. Sarcoplasmic
reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA2a), the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, was 
found to be a key factor in the alteration of calcium cycling. With the
advancement of gene vectors, SERCA2a emerged as an attractive clinical target for
gene delivery purposes. Using adeno-associated virus constructs, SERCA2a
upregulation has been found to improve myocardial function in animal models. The 
clinical benefits of overexpressing SERCA2a have been demonstrated in the phase I
study Calcium Upregulation by Percutaneous Administration of Gene Therapy in
Cardiac Disease (CUPID). This study has demonstrated that a persistent expression
of the transgene SERCA2a is associated with a significant improvement in
associated biochemical alterations and clinical symptoms of heart failure. In the
coming years, additional targets will likely emerge that are amenable to genetic 
manipulations along with the development of more advanced vector systems with
safer delivery approaches.
