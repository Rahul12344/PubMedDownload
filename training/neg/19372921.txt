PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The question of when to initiate antiretroviral treatment for 
children is perhaps the most critical unanswered question in pediatric HIV
therapeutics. With large numbers of children throughout the world acquiring HIV
infection and with improved global access to HIV treatment it is particularly
timely to consider the optimal time to initiate antiretroviral therapy in
infants, children and adolescents.
RECENT FINDINGS: Early treatment can result in suppression of HIV viremia, immune
preservation and prevention of disease progression. This must be balanced by the 
challenges of maintaining adherence to multidrug regimens, the risks of selecting
drug-resistant virus, and long and short-term toxicities of medications.
SUMMARY: This review provides a framework within which to consider when to
initiate children on antiretroviral treatment. A child's age and developmental
status, where they live, and the goals and expectations for treatment provide a
context for balancing the risks of disease progression with the risks of
drug-related toxicities and viral resistance.
