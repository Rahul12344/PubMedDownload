Long-term persistence of the avian leukosis virus (ALV), the
transformation-defective mutant of Prague strain Rous sarcoma virus subgroup C
(td PR-C) was established in heterologous duck hosts after infection in
mid-embryogenesis. Transient viraemia was observed for about 4 weeks after
hatching and was lost in most of the infected ducks by about 6 months. Loss of
viraemia was accompanied by the increasing synthesis of virus-neutralizing
antibodies. In spite of strong virus-neutralizing antibodies, virus was detected 
by the cocultivation assay in duck tissues throughout the observation period up
to 5 years. In the viraemic phase of infection, we found integrated proviruses in
various tissues, preferentially in stomach muscle tissue and in the thymus. The
long-term persistence of virus was frequently accompanied by liver necrosis and
neoplastic diseases. Injection of td PR-C virus into early embryos resulted in
more pronounced infection accompanied by an increased copy number of viral DNA
per cell, high mortality and remarkable atrophy of thymus tissue in infected
ducklings.
