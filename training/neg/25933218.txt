BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) have been well 
investigated in human cancers, where they are frequently overexpressed and
associated with poor prognosis. Here we explored the role of baculoviral IAP
repeat containing 6 (BIRC6), a member of IAPs, in human colorectal cancer (CRC).
METHODS: We used Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine BIRC6
expression in 7 CRC cell lines and 126 CRC clinical samples. We determined the
biological significance of BIRC6 in CRC cell lines by a lentivirus-mediated
silencing method.
RESULTS: We reported that BIRC6 was overexpressed in CRC cell lines and clinical 
CRC tissues. BIRC6 overexpression was correlated with tumor size and invasion
depth of CRC. BIRC6 overexpression is associated with worse overall survival (OS)
(P = 0.001) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.010). BIRC6 knockdown 
inhibited cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at S phase, downregulated
cyclin A2, B1, D1 and E1 levels, and sensitized CRC cells to chemotherapy in
vitro and in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggests that BIRC6 overexpression is a
predictor of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and BIRC6 could be a potential
target of CRC therapy.
