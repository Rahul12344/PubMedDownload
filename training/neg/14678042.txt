Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a grave complication of
transplantation and the result of uncontrolled proliferation of B lymphocytes
infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Herein we assess whether EBV infects
renal grafts and whether there is a relationship between EBV kidney infection and
PTLD. Allograft biopsies from 23 patients with PTLD were studied for the presence
of EBV DNA and RNA (EBER-1, -2) by in situ hybridization and for CD21 by
immunohistochemistry. Results were compared to 43 transplants from people without
PTLD. EBV DNA and RNA were detected in 11/43 patients without PTLD (26%), and in 
15/23 (65%) patients with PTLD (p = 0.004). EBV DNA and RNA localized to proximal
tubular cells and these cells showed up-regulation of the EBV receptor CD21.
EBV-infected allografts were noted in 12/12 patients with PTLD located near the
allograft and in 3/11 (27%) of patients with PTLD distant from the graft.
Multiple biopsies in eight patients showed that graft EBV infection can precede
the diagnosis of PTLD by as long as 42 months. It is concluded that EBV can
infect kidney allografts, and there appears to be a relationship between this
infection and the presence of PTLD near the graft.
