We conducted a pilot, open-label study to assess the effect of short-term
beta-carotene administration (180 mg/d with meals for 4 weeks) on the plasma
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA levels and CD4+ lymphocyte counts in 21
HIV-infected patients. We found that plasma HIV RNA levels and CD4+ lymphocyte
counts did not change following this short course of beta-carotene
supplementation. Patients with lower serum concentrations of beta-carotene before
supplementation were no more likely to have an increase in their CD4+ lymphocyte 
count or plasma HIV RNA copy number than were those with higher concentrations.
No correlation was found between pre- or postsupplementation beta-carotene or
vitamin A concentrations and pre- or postsupplementation CD4+ lymphocyte counts
or plasma HIV RNA titers. This study provides no support for beta-carotene
supplementation for HIV-infected subjects with normal baseline serum levels of
beta-carotene and vitamin A.
