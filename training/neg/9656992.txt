The Nef gene of the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses HIV and SIV has
been implicated in pathogenicity; however, the mechanism by which Nef induces
disease is still unknown. An impact on signal transduction in cells has been
suggested by the interaction of Nef from an HIV-1 strain and tyrosine kinases
like HCK and LCK as well as serine/threonine kinases. We have confirmed the
binding of HCK to HIV-1 subtype B Nef and demonstrated an equally strong
interaction with a subtype E Nef protein but weaker binding to Nef of HIV-2
subtype A (HIV-2D194). No binding, however, was observed to HIV-2 subtype B Nef
(HIV-2D205). Instead, this protein bound to a novel cellular protein, Nefin 1,
with characteristics of an adaptor protein and strong expression in all human
hematopoietic tissues. Nefin 1 binds through an amino-terminal domain, which is
related to SH3 domains. For interaction of Nef with Nefin 1, the PxxP motif and
the three-dimensional conformation of the molecule appear necessary. In
conclusion, this study demonstrates that Nef proteins of divergent strains of
HIV-1 and HIV-2 may use different elements of signal transduction pathways for
the induction of pathogenicity in vivo.
