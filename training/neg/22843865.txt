Members of the genus Marinomonas in the Gammaproteobacteria are broadly
distributed in marine environments where they could be infected by
bacteriophages. Here we report the genome sequence of bacteriophage P12026 that
can lytically infect bacterial strain IMCC12026, a member of the genus
Marinomonas. To our knowledge, this is the first genome sequence of a lytic
bacteriophage infecting the genus Marinomonas.
