Thirty-five human influenza A(H5N1) cases were reported in Cambodia during
2013-2014 after emergence of a clade 1.1.2 reassortant virus. We tested 881
villagers and found 2 cases of pauci- or asymptomatic infection. Seroprevalence
after emergence of the reassortant strain (0.2%) was lower than the aggregate
seroprevalence of 1.3% reported in earlier studies.
