Cleavage of DNA.RNA hybrids by type II restriction enzymes.

Molloy PL, Symons RH.

The action of a number of restriction enzymes on DNA.RNA hybrids has been
examined using hybrids synthesised with RNAs of cucumber mosaic virus as
templates. The enzymes EcoRI, HindII, SalI, MspI, HhaI, AluI, TaqI and HaeIII
cleaved the DNA strand of the hybrids (and possible also the RNA strand) into
specific fragments. For four of these enzymes, HhaI, AluI, TaqI and HaeIII,
comparison of the restriction fragments produced with the known sequences of the 
viral RNAs confirmed that they were recognising and cleaving the DNA strand of
the hybrids at their correct recognition sequences. It is likely that the ability
to utilise DNA.RNA hybrids as substrates is a general property of Type II
restriction enzymes.
