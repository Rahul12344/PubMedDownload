Reye's syndrome associated with respiratory syncytial virus infection.

Griffin N, Keeling JW, Tomlinson AH.

An upper respiratory tract infection in a 22-month-old boy was followed by rapid 
loss of consciousness, hypoglycaemia, uraemia, and death. Necropsy examination
showed fatty change of liver and kidneys, severe cerebral oedema, bronchiolitis, 
and endocardial fibroelastosis affecting the left ventricle. Immunofluorescence
staining showed infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The clinical
and pathological findings were those of Reye's syndrome, not previously reported 
accompanying RSV infection.
