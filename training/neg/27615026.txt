BACKGROUND: Advances in therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus
(HCV) have ushered in a new era in chronic hepatitis treatment. To maximise the
effectiveness of these medicines, individuals must be engaged and retained in
care. We analysed operational interventions to enhance chronic viral hepatitis
testing, linkage to care, treatment uptake, adherence, and viral suppression or
cure.
METHODS: We did a systematic review of operational interventions, and did
meta-analyses for sufficiently comparable data. We searched PubMed, Embase, WHO
library, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, PsycINFO, and CINAHL
for randomised controlled trials and controlled non-randomised studies that
examined operational interventions along the chronic viral hepatitis care
continuum, published in English up to Dec 31, 2014. We included
non-pharmaceutical intervention studies with primary or secondary outcomes of
testing, linkage to care, treatment uptake, treatment adherence, treatment
completion, treatment outcome, or viral endpoints. We excluded dissertations and 
studies of children only. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers, with 
disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Studies were assessed for bias. Data 
from similar interventions were pooled and quality of evidence was assessed using
GRADE. This study was registered in PROSPERO (42014015094).
FINDINGS: We identified 7583 unduplicated studies, and included 56 studies that
reported outcomes along the care continuum (41 for HCV and 18 for HBV). All
studies except one were from high-income countries. Lay health worker HBV test
promotion interventions increased HBV testing rates (relative risk [RR] 2·68, 95%
CI 1·82-3·93). Clinician reminders to prompt HCV testing during clinical visits
increased HCV testing rates (3·70, 1·81-7·57). Nurse-led educational
interventions improved HCV treatment completion (1·14, 1·05-1·23) and cure (odds 
ratio [OR] 1·93, 95% CI 1·44-2·59). Coordinated mental health, substance misuse, 
and hepatitis treatment services increased HCV treatment uptake (OR 3·03,
1·24-7·37), adherence (RR 1·22, 1·05-1·41), and cure (RR 1·21, 1·07-1·38)
compared with usual care.
INTERPRETATION: Several simple, inexpensive operational interventions can
substantially improve engagement and retention along the chronic viral hepatitis 
care continuum. Further operational research to inform scale-up of hepatitis
services is needed in low-income and middle-income countries.
