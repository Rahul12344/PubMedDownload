SUMMARY. The isolation and molecular characterization of pigeon paramyxovirus
type 1 (PPMV-1) from a sick racing pigeon in Uruguay is reported for the first
time. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests were performed to detect antibodies 
against avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1), and a HI titer of 1/32 was
obtained. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were processed by real-time reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) with the use of the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory-U.S. Department of Agriculture validated matrix
(M) gene assay and were positive for APMV-1. Viral isolation in embryonated
chicken eggs confirmed the molecular detection of the isolate. A fragment
corresponding to the 3' region of the fusion (F) protein gene was amplified by
RT-PCR, and subsequently sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence at the F
protein cleavage site displayed the motif 112RRQKR/F117. Phylogenetic analysis of
this part of the genome allowed the isolated virus to be grouped in the lineage
VIb/ 4b, which suggests that it shares the same ecologic niche with other PPMV-1 
that were found in the region, and it is not imported as other European or North 
American viruses.
