IRF-3 is a member of the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and plays a
principal role in the induction of interferon-beta (IFN-beta) by virus infection.
Virus infection results in the phosphorylation of IRF-3 by IkappaB kinase epsilon
and TANK-binding kinase 1, leading to its dimerization and association with the
coactivators CREB-binding protein/p300. The IRF-3 holocomplex translocates to the
nucleus, where it induces IFN-beta. In the present study, we examined the
molecular mechanism of IRF-3 activation. Using bacterial two-hybrid screening, we
isolated molecules that interact with IRF-3. One of these was cyclophilin B, a
member of the immunophilins with a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity. 
A GST pull-down assay suggested that one of the autoinhibition domains of IRF-3
and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase domain of cyclophilin B are required for the
binding. A knockdown of cyclophilin B expression by RNA interference resulted in 
the suppression of virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition
of the subsequent dimerization, association with CREB-binding protein, binding to
the target DNA element, and induction of IFN-beta. These findings indicate that
cyclophilin B plays a critical role in IRF-3 activation.
