In an attempt to enhance the frequency and level of expression of a
poor-performing MMTV-driven transgene, we co-integrated this construct with the
ovine beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) gene in transgenic mice. Seven lines of transgenic
mice possessing co-integrated BLG and MMTV-RZ5 transgenes were compared with 12
lines of mice that possessed only the MMTV-RZ5 construct. Co-integration enhanced
the frequency of expression in the mammary gland from two out of 12 lines for the
MMTV-RZ5 transgene alone, to five out of seven when co-integrated with BLG.
Surprisingly, co-integration also resulted in co-expression of the two transgenes
in the salivary gland, lung and spleen in addition to the mammary gland.
Furthermore, both transgenes were expressed in virgin animals, and throughout
pregnancy and lactation, suggesting that the developmental regulation of the
locus follows that of the MMTV-promoter. These findings represent a novel locus
control property of the ovine BLG gene that confers commitment of the locus to
the mammary gland, but also to a range of heterogeneous tissues possibly defined 
by the second promoter at the locus.
