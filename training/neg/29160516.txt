INTRODUCTION: Prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and associated
factors were investigated in rural settlements in Central Brazil.
METHODS: A total of 464 settlers were interviewed, and serum samples were tested 
for anti-HEV IgG/IgM. Positive samples were tested for HEV RNA.
RESULTS: Sixteen participants (3.4%; 95% CI 2.0-5.7) were positive for anti-HEV
IgG. None was positive for anti-HEV IgM. HEV RNA was not detected. Dwelling in a 
rural settlement for >5 years was associated with HEV seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed the absence of acute infection and a low
prevalence of previous exposure to HEV.
