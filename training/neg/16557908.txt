High titers of interferon were induced by the psittacosis agent in guinea pig
leukocyte cultures. Optimal yields of interferon were produced from freshly
prepared guinea pig leukocyte cultures containing 4 x 10(6) cells per ml
inoculated with a psittacosis/cell multiplicity of 1.0 and incubated at 35 C for 
24 hr. Leukocytes obtained from 2- to 4-month-old guinea pigs produced 20 times
more interferon than leukocytes from 3- to 4-week-old animals. The biological
activity of interferon and the kinetics of its production from
psittacosis-infected guinea pig leukocyte cultures were similar to those reported
for virus-induced leukocyte interferons.
