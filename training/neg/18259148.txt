A simple and general method has been developed for the synthesis of
various4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives by the treatment of the appropriate
3-amino-2-aryl-4(3H)-quinazolinone with a substituted benzaldehyde in ethanol.
The structures of the compoundswere characterized by elemental analysis, IR,
(1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR spectra. The title 2-aryl- or
2-methyl-3-(substituted-benzalamino)-4(3H)-quinazolinone compounds III-1~III-31
were found to possess moderate to good antiviral activity. Semi-quantitative PCR 
andReal Time PCR assays were used to ascertain the target of action of compound
III-31against TMV. The studies suggest that III-31 possesses antiviral activity
due to inductionof up-regulation of PR-1a and PR-5, thereby inhibiting virus
proliferation and movementby enhancement of the activity of some defensive
enzyme.
