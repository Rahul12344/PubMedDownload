BACKGROUND: As general anaesthesia may compromise the immune system, it has been 
hypothesized that latent varicella-zoster virus is more likely to be reactivated 
and cause herpes zoster in mothers after Caesarean deliveries under general
anaesthesia. Our study was thus aimed at investigating the risk of herpes zoster 
among women during the first year after Caesarean deliveries under either general
or regional anaesthesia.
METHODS: Two nationwide population-based data sets were utilized, including the
Taiwan birth certificate registry and the Taiwan National Health Insurance
Research Dataset. From 2001 to 2003, a total of 162 495 women underwent Caesarean
delivery. Among them, 21 454 women received general anaesthesia, whereas 141 041 
patients received regional anaesthesia. Each individual was followed for 1 yr to 
identify the subsequent occurrence of herpes zoster. Cox's proportional hazards
regressions were performed for analysis.
RESULTS: During the 1 yr follow-up period, 0.46% of the women receiving general
anaesthesia experienced an episode of herpes zoster, compared with 0.34% of women
receiving regional anaesthesia. In Caesarean deliveries, the use of general
anaesthesia compared with regional anaesthesia was independently associated with 
a 1.29-fold (95% confidence interval=1.04-1.61) increase in the 1 yr risk of
herpes zoster, after adjusting for maternal and infant characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series, there was a small increased risk of herpes zoster in
the year after Caesarean delivery with general anaesthesia. Future studies are
needed to further investigate these findings.
