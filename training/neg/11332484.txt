In order to trace the origin and evolution of avian infectious bronchitis virus
(IBV) isolates in China and Southeast Asia, genomic sequencing was used for
molecular characterization of 24 IBV isolates and two reference strains in
comparison with the published sequences. The 5' region of the S1 genes,
containing hypervariable regions I and II, and 3' region of the nucleocapsid
genes, containing cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes, were used to construct
phylogenetic trees for analysis. The results showed that the 24 isolates could be
divided into three distinct groups, that is, American, Asian, and European. Some 
isolates formed a distinct Asian phylogenetic group, suggesting that IBV has
existed for some time in Asia. Our results also showed that in vivo recombination
of IBV may have occurred at a rather high frequency, contributing to the
diversity of these IBV isolates. Importantly, recombination events have probably 
occurred between vaccine strains and field strains in the natural condition.
