Enterovirus 76 (EV76) is a new member of species Human Enterovirus A (HEV-A). So 
far, the only complete genome sequence of the prototype strain from France has
been available. In this study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of 
strain 04360, isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis patient in Shandong
province, China in 2004. Sequence analysis revealed 80.7-94.7% VP1 nucleotide
identity to other EV76 strains and provided evidence of recombination with other 
types of HEV-A in the P2 and P3 coding regions.
