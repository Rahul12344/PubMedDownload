Enterovirus-specific genetic sequences were isolated from two Amblyomma
americanum tick pools. Identical genetic sequences were later obtained from
cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with aseptic meningitis and a recent history of 
tick attachment. These observations suggest the possibility of an emerging
tick-borne human enterovirus associated with aseptic meningitis.
