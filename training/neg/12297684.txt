OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to define the prevalence of infection
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus, and various intestinal
parasites among different groups of primary refugees immigrating to Minnesota.
METHODS: 2,545 refugees arriving in Minnesota during 1999 received a domestic
health examination that included tuberculin skin testing, hepatitis B virus
serologic testing, and stool ova and parasite examinations. The Refugee Health
Assessment form asked specifically about screening results for amebiasis,
ascariasis, clonorchiasis, giardiasis, hookworm, schistosomiasis,
strongyloidiasis, and trichuriasis.
RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of refugees had a reactive tuberculin test of >or=10 
mm induration, with a higher prevalence in males (54%) and refugees >or=18 years 
of age (63%) (p<0.001). Seven percent had a positive hepatitis B surface antigen,
with the highest prevalence in those people from sub-Saharan Africa (8%)
(p=0.002) and those refugees >or=18 years of age (9%) (p=0.006). Twenty-two
percent had one or more intestinal parasites asked about, including 30% of those 
refugees <18 years of age (p<0.001). The most commonly reported parasitic
infections were trichuriasis (8%) and giardiasis (7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of infection with M. tuberculosis, hepatitis B virus, or
one of eight intestinal parasites was present in a substantial proportion of
refugees receiving the domestic health assessment. Screening for such infections 
gives new immigrants the opportunity to receive important medical evaluation and 
treatment, provides valuable surveillance data, and allows appropriate public
health measures to be taken.
