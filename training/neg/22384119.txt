The mammalian tick-borne flavivirus group (MTBFG) contains viruses associated
with important human and animal diseases such as encephalitis and hemorrhagic
fever. In contrast to mosquito-borne flaviviruses where recombination events are 
frequent, the evolutionary dynamic within the MTBFG was believed to be
essentially clonal. This assumption was challenged with the recent report of
several homologous recombinations within the Tick-borne encephalitis virus
(TBEV). We performed a thorough analysis of publicly available genomes in this
group and found no compelling evidence for the previously identified
recombinations. However, our results show for the first time that demonstrable
recombination (i.e., with large statistical support and strong phylogenetic
evidences) has occurred in the MTBFG, more specifically within the Louping ill
virus lineage. Putative parents, recombinant strains and breakpoints were further
tested for statistical significance using phylogenetic methods. We investigated
the time of divergence between the recombinant and parental strains in a Bayesian
framework. The recombination was estimated to have occurred during a window of
282 to 76 years before the present. By unravelling the temporal setting of the
event, we adduce hypotheses about the ecological conditions that could account
for the observed recombination.
