Control measures for foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Nigeria have not been
implemented due to the absence of locally produced vaccines and risk-based
analysis resulting from insufficient data on the circulating FMD virus (FMDV)
serotypes/strains. In 2013-2015, blood and epithelial samples were collected from
reported FMD outbreaks in four states (Kaduna, Kwara, Plateau and Bauchi) in
northern Nigeria. FMDV non-structural protein (NSP) seroprevalence for the
outbreaks was estimated at 80% (72 of 90) and 70% (131 of 188) post-outbreak.
Antibodies against FMDV serotypes O, A, SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3 were detected across 
the states using solid-phase competitive ELISA. FMDV genome was detected in 99%
(73 of 74) of the samples from FMD-affected animals using rRT-PCR, and cytopathic
effect was found in cell culture by 59% (44 of 74) of these samples. Three FMDV
serotypes O, A and SAT2 were isolated and characterized. The phylogenetic
assessments of the virus isolates showed that two topotypes of FMDV serotype O,
East Africa-3 (EA-3) and West Africa (WA) topotypes were circulating, as well as 
FMDV strains belonging to the Africa genotype (G-IV) of serotype A and FMDV SAT2 
topotype VII strains. While the serotype O (EA-3) strains from Nigeria were most 
closely related to a 1999 virus strain from Sudan, the WA strain in Nigeria
shares genetic relationship with three 1988 viruses in Niger. The FMDV serotype A
strains were closely related to a known virus from Cameroon, and the SAT2 strains
were most closely related to virus subtypes in Libya. This study provides
evidence of co-occurrence of FMDV serotypes and topotypes in West, Central, East 
and North Africa, and this has implication for control. The findings help filling
the knowledge gap of FMDV dynamics in Nigeria and West Africa subregion to
support local and regional development of vaccination-based control plans and
international risk assessment.
