Influenza viruses remain a persistent challenge to human health owing to their
inherent ability to evade the immune response by antigenic drift. However, the
discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against divergent viruses
has sparked renewed interest in a universal influenza vaccine and novel
therapeutic opportunities. Here, a crystal structure at 1.70 Ã… resolution is
presented of the Fab of the human antibody CH65, which has broad neutralizing
activity against a range of seasonal H1 isolates. Previous studies proposed that 
affinity maturation of this antibody lineage pre-organizes the
complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops into an energetically favorable
HA-bound conformation. Indeed, from the structural comparisons of free and
HA-bound CH65 presented here, the CDR loops, and in particular the heavy-chain
CDR3, adopt the same conformations in the free and bound forms. Thus, these
findings support the notion that affinity maturation of the CH65 lineage
favorably preconfigures the CDR loops for high-affinity binding to influenza
hemagglutinin.
