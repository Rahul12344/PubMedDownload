The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to produce biotin-labelled human
papillomavirus (HPV) 16- and 18-specific DNA probes for in situ hybridization
(ISH). PCR was performed by using Amplitaq DNA amplification reagent kit
according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that dTTP was substituted by
different concentrations of biotinylated dUTP (bio-11-UTP). As template DNA, DNA 
extracted either from CaSki or HeLa cells was used. The reaction mixture was
taken through up to 40 cycles of amplification in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus Thermal
Cycler. The highest yield was achieved when the concentrations of dTTP and
biotinylated dUTP were 150 and 50 microM, respectively. ISH results compatible
with those obtained with biotinylated whole genomic HPV DNA probes were
demonstrated when primers from E7 and E6 ORF of the HPV-18 genome were used to
produce the biotinylated probe by PCR. With HPV-16, several areas of the genome
had to be amplified to generate a PCR probe with equal sensitivity as the whole
genomic probe. The background staining was always stronger with the PCR probes
than with the whole genomic probes. The sensitivity of the PCR probes does not
seem to bear a clear-cut correlation with the size or nucleotide content of the
probe, but it might rather depend on the three dimensional structure of the probe
and the availability of biotin for the detection system by ISH.
