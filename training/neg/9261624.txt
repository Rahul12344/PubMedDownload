BACKGROUND/AIMS: In this study, we evaluated the association among serum
transaminase values, seropositivity of HBV DNA and liver histopathology of
patients with positive HBsAg and HBe antibodies.
METHODOLOGY: Thirty-five patients were placed in two groups according to their
serum transaminase values. Patients with normal transaminase values were
evaluated in the first group. The patients with above normal transaminase values 
were subjected in the second group.
RESULTS: In the first group of patients with normal transaminase values,
biopsy-proven moderate or severe chronic hepatitis was not observed. HBV DNA
seropositivity was 53.3% in this group. Forty-five percent of the patients with
above normal transaminase values had moderate chronic hepatitis and
seropositivity for HBV DNA in this group was 55%. Our results supported the
association between transaminase values and liver pathology, but no statistically
significant association was shown between seropositivity of HBV DNA and liver
pathology.
CONCLUSION: There is much to be studied to understand the function of HBV DNA in 
the follow up of HBsAg carriers, and liver biopsy has to be used routinely in the
follow up of asymptomatic carriers when they happen to have high transaminase
values.
