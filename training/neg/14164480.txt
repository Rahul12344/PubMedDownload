THE FORMATION AND PROPERTIES OF POLIOVIRUS-NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY. III. SEQUENTIAL
CHANGES IN ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY OF 19S AND 7S ANTIBODIES SYNTHESIZED BY
RABBITS AFTER A SINGLE VIRUS INJECTION.

SVEHAG SE.

Rabbits injected intravenously with a single high dose of poliovirus (type 1)
produced two major 19S and two 75 type neutralizing antibody populations, with
different electrophoretic mobilities. The first 2 to 2(1/2) days after
immunization the antibody was of the 19S type and migrated as a single component 
in the beta-region. In contrast, the major 19S antibody synthesized from day 3 on
was a gamma(1)-globulin. 7S type antibody, appearing on day 4, was contained only
in the gamma(1)-region, while 10 to 14 days following immunization the 7S
antibody was associated with both gamma(1)- and gamma(2)-globulins. The
electrophoretic distribution of antibody in 2-week sera revealed the presence of 
at least four antibody populations (19S beta, 19S gamma(1), 7S gamma(1), and 7S
gamma(2)). Serum samples collected 1 or 2 weeks following antigenic stimulation
often contained small amounts of antibody which sedimented at a rate (11S to 15S)
intermediate to that of 7S and 19S antibodies. The neutralizing activity of the
19S type antibodies and the intermediately sedimenting antibody was destroyed by 
incubation with 0.1 M (5 days) or 0.2 M (1 day) 2-mercaptoethanol at 3 degrees C.
The 7S antibody activity was un-affected by treatment with from 0.1 to 0.8 M
mercaptan.
