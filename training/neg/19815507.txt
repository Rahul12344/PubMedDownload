Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), the role 
of the virus in lymphomagenesis is unclear. LMP2A, encoded by EBV, can be
detected in BL biopsies and has prosurvival functions. We generated mice
expressing MYC and LMP2A in B cells. LMP2A/lambda-MYC mice show greatly
accelerated tumor onset. Similar to previous work, we found p53 mutations in
lambda-MYC tumors; however, we detected no mutations in the rapidly arising
LMP2A/lambda-MYC tumors. We further demonstrate that the p53 pathway is
functionally intact in LMP2A/lambda-MYC tumors, which have increased levels of
PUMA and sensitivity to p53 activation by Nutlin. This work shows that LMP2A can 
permit tumorigenesis in the presence of an intact p53 pathway, identifying an
important contribution of EBV to BL.
