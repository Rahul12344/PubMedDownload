Concentration effects of methylene blue (MB) and oxygen on the photoinactivation 
rate of Q beta bacteriophage were examined. The effect of initial virus
concentration was verified on the similar f2 phage. The inactivation rate, kappa,
is an increasing function of MB and O2 concentration and shows saturation with
respect to MB concentration. Thus the results suggest that MB must adsorb to Q
beta sites and oxygen must be present for photoinactivation to occur. The
inactivation rate is independent of the initial number of phage particles present
before inactivation, indicating that inactivation does not depend upon
interaction among viral particles or on surface effects. The results indicate
that at least two different viral phenotypes exist within the wild-type Q beta
and f2 populations: one susceptible and the other resistant.
