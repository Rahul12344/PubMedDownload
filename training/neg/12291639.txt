PIP: A Peruvian nongovernmental organization (NGO), the New Life Christian
Community, works to promote human rights among homosexuals, pregnant teenagers,
and children suffering from sex abuse. The NGO, which is not affiliated with any 
church hierarchy, also provides training in AIDS and sexuality counseling as well
as personal development activities that promote health preservation. The NGO
supports AIDS sufferers by providing family support and temporary hospice care.
The Community plans to conduct research into adolescent pregnancy, the
relationship of sexuality and AIDS, and ways to support people with HIV/AIDS. The
Community's free newsletter geared for sexual minorities is distributed at social
venues and government health institutions. The NGO promotes condom use as a
resource for pleasure and is working to replace the prevailing reality of sex as 
power with the concept of sex as pleasure.
