Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 is the primary cause of genital ulceration worldwide.
The presence of atypical features like deep ulcerations, hypertrophic, or
pseudotumoural lesions or unusual location can be a marker for co-infection with 
HIV. These immunocompromised patients are usually resistant to the conventional
antiviral treatment. We present a case of an HIV-infected patient with
hypertrophic herpes genitalis, refractory to conventional oral antiviral therapy,
who was successfully treated with a combination of oral valcyclovir and topical
application of 5% imiquimod.
