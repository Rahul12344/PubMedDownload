Transfer factor for the prevention of varicella-zoster infection in childhood
leukemia.

Steele RW, Myers MG, Vincent MM.

Sixty-one patients with leukemia and no immunity to chickenpox were given
dialyzable transfer factor or placebo and followed for 12 to 30 months in a
double-blind trial designed to examine the clinical efficacy of transfer factor. 
Sixteen patients in the transfer-factor group and 15 in the placebo group were
exposed to varicella zoster, and most of them had a rise in antibody titer.
Chickenpox developed in 13 of 15 exposed patients in the placebo group but in
only one of 16 in the transfer-factor group (P = 1.3 x 10(-5)). In the patients
treated with transfer factor and exposed to varicella without acquiring
chickenpox the titer of antibody to varicella zoster was equal to that in the
patients given placebo who became infected with chickenpox. Transfer factor
converted negative results on skin tests for varicella zoster to positive in
approximately half the recipients. Passive immunization with dialyzable transfer 
factor appears useful in nonimmune persons.
