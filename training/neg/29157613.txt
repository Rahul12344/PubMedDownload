Castleman disease (CD) describes a group of heterogeneous disorders with common
lymph node histopathologic features, including atrophic or hyperplastic germinal 
centers, prominent follicular dendritic cells, hypervascularization, polyclonal
lymphoproliferation, and/or polytypic plasmacytosis. The cause and pathogenesis
of the four subtypes of CD (unicentric CD; human herpesvirus-8-associated
multicentric CD; polyradiculoneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal
plasma cell disorder, and skin changes [POEMS]-associated multicentric CD; and
idiopathic multicentric CD) vary considerably. This article provides a summary of
our current understanding of the cause, cell types, signaling pathways, and
effector cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of each subtype.
