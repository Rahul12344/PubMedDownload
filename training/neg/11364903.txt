HIV research overview: interview with David Ho, M.D. Interview by John S. James.

Ho D.

AIDS: In an interview with AIDS Treatment News, Dr. David Ho, director of the
Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, provides his views on current HIV treatment
research. Dr. Ho discusses 1) research on early and aggressive treatment, 2) the 
practice of individualizing drug doses based on frequent blood monitoring to
retard drug resistance and viral rebound, 3) recent reports of triple combination
therapy virological failure with CD4 counts remaining high and viral load not
rebounding as high, 4) the necessity for viral load testing to measure fewer than
400 copies, 5) the role of viral resistance testing for drug selection, and 6)
whether complete viral eradication is possible. Dr. Ho states that although it is
rare, a person can become reinfected with a second strain of HIV once one strain 
has been established. In the future, there will be better and less toxic drugs
and possibly eradication.
