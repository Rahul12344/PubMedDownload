Whereas resistance genes (R-genes) governing qualitative resistance have been
isolated and characterized, the biological roles of genes governing quantitative 
resistance (quantitative trait loci, QTLs) are still unknown. We hypothesized
that genes at QTLs could share homologies with cloned R-genes. We used a
PCR-based approach to isolate R-gene analogs (RGAs) with consensus primers
corresponding with conserved domains of cloned R-genes: (i) the nucleotide
binding site (NBS) and hydrophobic domain, and (ii) the kinase domain.
PCR-amplified fragments were sequenced and mapped on a pepper intraspecific map. 
NBS-containing sequences of pepper, most similar to the N gene of tobacco, were
classified into seven families and all mapped in a unique region covering 64 cM
on the Noir chromosome. Kinase domain containing sequences and cloned R-gene
homologs (Pto, Fen, Cf-2) were mapped on four different linkage groups. A QTL
involved in partial resistance to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) with an additive
effect was closely linked or allelic to one NBS-type family. QTLs with epistatic 
effects were also detected at several RGA loci. The colocalizations between
NBS-containing sequences and resistance QTLs suggest that the mechanisms of
qualitative and quantitative resistance may be similar in some cases.
