A number of genetic disorders are manifested in cutaneous epithelium and gene
therapy approaches for treatment of such diseases are being considered. A
successful gene therapy protocol requires durable and correctly targeted gene
expression within the tissue. The continuous renewal and high levels of
compartmentalization in epidermis are two challenges for a successful gene
therapy of skin disorders. For those disorders which affect the upper layers of
epidermis, vectors must be available that target stem cells, but remain silent
until the progeny of these cells undergo differentiation. To explore the
potential of long-term and targeted vector expression in epidermis, a hybrid
retroviral vector encoding the reporter enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)
was constructed. The viral enhancer in the long terminal repeat of the vector was
replaced with a 510-bp enhancer element of the human involucrin promoter.
Keratinocyte-specific expression directed by the hybrid vector was demonstrated
in culture and suprabasal-specific expression was observed in organotypic human
epidermal cultures. In vivo transduction of mouse skin with this hybrid vector
indicated long-term and stratum-specific expression of the transgene in mouse
epidermis. The design of similar vectors for various gene therapy applications
constitutes an important step toward clinically effective gene therapy.
