Many studies have reported poor vital prognosis in hepatitis C virus
(HCV)-infected dialysis patients. The rate of HCV-infected dialysis patients in
Japan is as high as 9.8%, and antiviral therapy is believed to be important for
improving vital prognosis. We conducted a multicenter study to examine the
administration method for pegylated interferon α-2a (PEG-IFNα-2a) monotherapy in 
HCV-infected dialysis. We studied 56 patients: 14 with low viral loads (HCV RNA <
5.0 log IU/mL) were treated with 90 μg PEG-IFNα-2a weekly, 42 with high viral
loads (HCV RNA ≥ 5.0 log IU/mL) were treated with 135 μg PEG-IFNα-2a weekly. We
examined the sustained virological response (SVR), factors affecting the SVR, and
treatment safety. The overall SVR rate was 39% (22/56); that for genotype 1,
genotype 2, low viral loads, and high viral loads was 29%, 67%, 93%, and 21%,
respectively. From receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the HCV RNA 
cutoff values likely to achieve SVR for genotypes 1 and 2 were <5.7 log IU/mL
(SVR rate: 64% 9/14) and <6.5 log IU/mL (SVR rate: 88% 7/8), respectively. If
there was HCV RNA negativation at 4 weeks (rapid virological response), the SVR
rate was 94% (16/17), whereas it was 6% (1/16) if there was HCV RNA positivity at
24 weeks. The rate of treatment discontinuation from adverse events or aggravated
complications was 25% (14/56). High SVR rates can potentially be achieved with
PEG-IFN monotherapy by identifying the target patients, based on virus type and
viral load before initiating treatment and by modifying therapy during treatment 
according to responsiveness.
