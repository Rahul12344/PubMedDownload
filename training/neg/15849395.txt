The aim of the paper was to describe therapeutic difficulties in a patient with
ulcerative colitis. In the long-term clinical course of the disease a concomitant
infection with hepatotropic viruses (HBV, HCV) was diagnosed. Due to the
different treatment of autoimmunological diseases and chronic viral hepatitis the
necessity of further search of therapeutic schedules for this group of patients
is still needed.
