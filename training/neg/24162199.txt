One hundred and ten markers were analysed for linkage in 218 F2 plants derived
from two divergent cultivars ('Védrantais' and 'Songwhan Charmi') of Cucumis melo
(L.). Thirty-four RFLPs, 64 RAPDs, one isozyme, four disease resistance markers
and one morphological marker were used to construct a genetic map spanning 14
linkage groups covering 1390 cM of the melon genome. RAPD and RFLP markers
detected similar polymorphism levels. RFLPs were largely due to base
substitutions rather than insertion/deletions. Twelve percent of markers showed
distorted segregation. Phenotypic markers consisted of two resistance genes
against Fusarium wilt (Fom-1 and Fom-2), one gene (nsv) controlling the
resistance to melon necrotic spot virus, one gene (Vat) conferring resistance to 
Aphis gossypii, and a recessive gene for carpel numbers (3 vs 5 carpels: p).
