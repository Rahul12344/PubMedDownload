The authors report a fatal outcome in a 4-year-old boy with herpes simplex virus 
(HSV) pneumonia and ependymoma. The patient had respiratory distress that
worsened despite antibiotic treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage showed intranuclear
viral inclusions, and culture was positive for HSV type 1. His T-cell count was
significantly decreased. Although acyclovir and foscarnet were given, the patient
died. Postmortem examination showed HSV pneumonitis with severe alveolar damage
and severe involutional changes of the thymus with absence of Hassall's
corpuscles. HSV must be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with
interstitial pneumonia and T-cell deficiency, especially after craniospinal
irradiation.
