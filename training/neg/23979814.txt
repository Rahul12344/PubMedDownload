BACKGROUND: KIM-1 staining is upregulated in proximal tubule-derived renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) including clear renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell
carcinoma, but not in chromophobe RCC (distal tubular tumor). This study was
designed to prospectively examine urine KIM-1 level before and 1 month after
removal of renal tumors.
PATIENTS AND DESIGN: A total of 19 patients were eventually enrolled in the study
based on pre-operative imaging studies. Pre-operative and follow-up (1 month)
urine KIM-1 levels were measured. The urine KIM-1 levels (uKIM-1) were then
normalized to urine creatinine levels (uCr). Renal tumors were also stained for
KIM-1 using immunohistochemical techniques.
RESULTS: The KIM-1-negative staining group included 7 cases, and the
KIM-1-positive group consisted of 12 cases. The percentage of KIM-1-positive
staining RCC cells ranged from 10 to 100 %, and the staining intensity ranged
from 1+ to 3+. In both groups, serum creatinine levels were both significantly
elevated after nephrectomy. In the KIM-1-negative group, uKIM-1/uCr remained at a
similar level before (0.37 ± 0.1 ng/mg Cr) and after nephrectomy (0.32 ± 0.01
ng/mg Cr). However, in the KIM-1-positive group, elevated uKIM-1/uCr at 1.20 ±
0.31 ng/mg Cr was significantly reduced to 0.36 ± 0.1 ng/mg Cr, which was similar
to the pre-operative uKIM-1/uCr (0.37 ± 0.1 ng/mg Cr) in the KIM-1-negative
group.
CONCLUSION: Our small but prospective study showed significant reduction in
uKIM-1/uCr after nephrectomy in the KIM-1 positive group, suggesting that urine
KIM-1 may serve as a surrogate biomarker for kidney cancer and a non-invasive
pre-operative measure to evaluate the malignant potential of renal masses.
