We have previously shown that a protein derived from the p7 nucleocapsid (NC)
protein of HIV type-1 increases kcat/Km and kcat for cleavage of a cognate
substrate by a hammerhead ribozyme. Here we show directly that the increase in
kcat/Km arises from catalysis of the annealing of the RNA substrate to the
ribozyme and the increase in kcat arises from catalysis of dissociation of the
RNA products from the ribozyme. A peptide polymer derived from the consensus
sequence of the C-terminal domain of the hnRNP A1 protein (A1 CTD) provides
similar enhancements. Although these effects apparently arise from non-specific
interactions, not all non-specific binding interactions led to these
enhancements. NC and A1 CTD exert their effects by accelerating attainment of the
thermodynamically most stable species throughout the ribozyme catalytic cycle. In
addition, NC protein is shown to resolve a misfolded ribozyme-RNA complex that is
otherwise long lived. These in vitro results suggest that non-specific RNA
binding proteins such as NC and hnRNP proteins may have a biological role as RNA 
chaperones that prevent misfolding of RNAs and resolve RNAs that have misfolded, 
thereby ensuring that RNA is accessible for its biological functions.
