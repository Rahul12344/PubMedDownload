Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the cause of adult T-cell
leukemia, is also associated with the neurological disease, TSP/HAM (tropical
spastic paraparesis/HTLV-I associated myelopathy). The HTLV-I genome encodes a
protein, Tax, that trans activates viral and cellular gene transcription. To
understand the mechanisms for the production of cytokines by HTLV-I in nervous
tissue, we examined their expression in glial cells which carried the
Tax-expressing vector. We demonstrated that Tax expression enhanced the
production by glial cells of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta. We 
suggest that the excessive production of cytokines in nervous tissue may play a
role in pathogenesis of TSP/HAM. Glial cells that carry the tax gene may provide 
a model useful for in vitro study of the mechanism of production of cytokines in 
the nervous system.
