BACKGROUND/AIMS: Most patients with acute viral hepatitis A have a favorable
course, but a few of them suffer from severe forms of hepatitis such as fulminant
hepatitis. This study was carried out to identify the factors influencing the
severity of acute viral hepatitis A.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 713 patients with
acute hepatitis A, who were divided into two groups: severe hepatitis A (N=87)
and non-severe hepatitis A (N=626). Severe hepatitis was defined as fulminant
hepatitis or prolongation of prothrombin time (INRâ‰¥1.5). Clinical variables were 
compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: The incidence of fulminant hepatitis was 1.4 % (10/713) in patients with
acute hepatitis A. Thirty-three (4.6 %) cases exhibited HBsAg positivity. In
multivariate analyses, significant alcohol intake and the presence of HBsAg were 
significant predictive factors of fulminant hepatitis A, and significant alcohol 
intake and age were significant predictive factors of severe hepatitis A. HBeAg
and HBV-DNA status did not affect the clinical course of hepatitis A in chronic
hepatitis B carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: While most patients with acute hepatitis A have an uncomplicated
clinical course, our data suggest that a more-severe clinical course is
correlated with being older, significant alcohol intake, and chronic
hepatitis-B-virus infection.
