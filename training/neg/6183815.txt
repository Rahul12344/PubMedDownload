Variations in host defence mechanisms and blastogenesis in chickens and mice
after rifamycin treatments.

Alonso ML, Rojo JM, Moya MP, Ronda E.

The immunobiological effect of rifamycins on different experimental models has
been comparatively studied in chickens and mice using cyclophosphamide as a
reference immunosuppressive agent. "In vivo" treatments with rifampicin and
rifamycin SV diminished interferon levels in chickens and mice up to two hours
after virus challenge. Mitogen induced blastogenesis was significantly depressed 
by either "in vivo" (5-50 mg/kg) or "in vitro" (5-20 micrograms/ml) drug
treatments, although the activation of B lymphocytes was more easily inhibited
than that of T lymphocytes. Primary anti-SRBC immune responses suffered a similar
immune suppressive action by rifamycin treatments "in vivo". In every case,
cyclophosphamide (10-20 micrograms/ml "in vitro" and 25 mg/kg "in vivo") proved
to be the most active immunosuppressant. On the other hand, a remarkable
parallelism in the effect of rifamycins in chickens and mice was observed in all 
the experimental systems used.
