Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a major pathogen in immunocompromised patients.
Transmission in this population is known to occur by fomites, but the potential
for airborne spread is unknown. In this study, air from the rooms of two
immunosuppressed patients with CMV pneumonia and one patient with latent
infection was filtered and examined by a polymerase chain reaction assay. CMV-DNA
was easily detected in the rooms of the patients with pneumonia and a weak
positive signal was detected in the room of the patient with latent CMV
infection. This technique permits the detection of aerosolized CMV-DNA and could 
possibly be adapted to detect other airborne pathogens.
