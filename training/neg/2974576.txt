Circadian variations in the number of circulating lymphocytes and their
subpopulations have been observed in healthy subjects. These cyclic changes are
characterized by a trough at 8:00 a.m. and a peak at midnight. Using multiple
peripheral blood samplings, we were able to confirm that this cycle applied to
CD4 T-cells (helpers) and to B-cells (CD20). No cycle of CD8 lymphocytes was
observed. In a second stage, for greater comfort of the patient the number of
samplings was reduced to two: one at 8:00 a.m. (trough) and one at midnight
(peak). This method enabled us to calculate the amplitude of lymphocytes cycles
in 18 controls and 74 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive patients.
In asymptomatic HIV carriers the amplitude of CD4 cycles was normal in 6/26 cases
and that of B-cell cycles in 2/17 cases. In the group of asymptomatic HIV
carriers the mean amplitude of the cycles was much less reduced than in the other
two groups. These results incite us to believe that the loss of the CD4 T-cell
cycles is an early sign of HIV infection antedating the decrease observed in the 
number of these cells.
