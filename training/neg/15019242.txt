The binding of viruses to synthetic polyacrylamide (PAA)-based
sialylglycoconjugates was used to characterize the receptor specificities of
antibody escape mutants of the influenza virus A/Mallard/Pennsylvania/10218/84
(H5N2). The sialylglycoconjugates that were used carried identical terminal
Neu5Acalpha2-3Gal moieties but differed in the structure of the next saccharide
residue(s). Our data show that mutations in the vicinity of the haemagglutinin
(HA) receptor-binding site (RBS) effect the recognition of the third saccharide
residue and change the affinity pattern of binding. The affinity of the majority 
of the escape mutants for sialyl receptors increased compared to the parental
strain.
