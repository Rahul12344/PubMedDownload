Monitoring of community influenza through sentinel practice networks is essential
to track the onset and progress of epidemics. In 1999, the Influenza Pandemic
Planning Committee of the Communicable Diseases Network Australia New Zealand
(CDNANZ) recommended that a national surveillance system be established
comprising both community-based and institutional surveillance. In 2001, however,
influenza surveillance remains fragmented in Australia and mainly restricted to
major cities. Methods of surveillance and reporting of influenza activity vary
between States and even within States. Three disparate case definitions are in
use for reporting influenza-like illnesses. Many sentinel sites do not have
laboratory support for confirmation of influenza or identification of circulating
strains. Dissemination of information is uncoordinated and without a standardised
reporting format for collation at a national level. Prompt attention to these
issues is important to ensure an adequate public health response to future
influenza virus epidemics or a pandemic.
