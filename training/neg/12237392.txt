Using tobacco nitrate reductase cosuppression as a model system of
post-transcriptional gene silencing, we analyzed the influence of DNA and RNA
dosages both together and independently. For this purpose, zero, one, two, or
four active or transcriptionally silenced copies of a cauliflower mosaic virus
35S-Nia2 transgene were combined by transformation and subsequent crosses with
zero, one, two, three, or four active, disrupted, or transcriptionally repressed 
copies of the wild-type host Nia genes. The analysis of the corresponding
transgenic lines revealed that (1) the percentage of isogenic plants that are
affected by cosuppression depends directly upon the relative dosage of both host 
gene and transgene; (2) transcriptional silencing of the 35S-Nia transgene
impedes cosuppression; and (3) the absence of host gene transcription reduces the
frequency of cosuppression or delays its triggering. Taken together, these
results indicate that transgene DNA per se is not sufficient to trigger
post-transcriptional cosuppression of nitrate reductase host genes and
transgenes. The requirement for a transcriptionally active state is discussed
with respect to both the RNA dosage and the DNA-DNA pairing hypotheses.
