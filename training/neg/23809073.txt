BACKGROUND: Acute hepatitis is a well-described cause of morbidity and sporadic
mortality in travelers. Data regarding the epidemiology of hepatitis in travelers
are lacking. The aim of this study is to describe the epidemiology of acute viral
hepatitis among travelers returning from tropical countries, with particular
attention to enterically transmitted hepatitis.
METHODS: This study is a prospective observational study of ill-returned
travelers who presented at two travel medicine clinics in Israel between the
years 1997 and 2012. Data of patients with acute hepatitis were summarized. Only 
travelers were included, immigrants and foreign workers were excluded.
RESULTS: Among 4,970 Israeli travelers who were seen during this period, 49 (1%) 
were diagnosed with acute hepatitis. Among them, hepatitis E virus (HEV) was the 
etiology in 19 (39%) cases and hepatitis A virus (HAV) was the etiology in 13
(27%) cases, demonstrating that 65% of all cases were due to enterically
transmitted hepatitis. Acquiring acute hepatitis B (two cases) or acute hepatitis
C (one case) was uncommon (6.1%). In 27% of the cases, no diagnosis was
determined. Fifty-five percent of cases were imported from the Indian
subcontinent, with a predominance of HEV infection (84%). A significant male
predominance was seen in all groups regardless of etiology. Pre-travel
consultation was documented in only 7% of those with vaccine preventable
hepatitis (hepatitis A & B) compared to 89% in those with hepatitis E.
CONCLUSIONS: Enterically transmitted hepatitis is the main causes of viral
hepatitis among travelers. HEV is an emerging disease and has become the most
common hepatitis among Israeli travelers. Although an efficacious vaccine has
been developed, no licensed HEV vaccine is yet available. Although hepatitis A
vaccine is highly efficacious, safe, and easily available, there is a stable
number of HAV cases.
