Distribution of ultraviolet-induced lesions in simian virus 40 DNA.

Bourre F, Renault G, Seawell PC, Sarasin A.

In order to analyze the molecular mechanisms of mutagenesis in mammalian cells,
we devised an analytical assay using Simian Virus 40 as biological probe. To
study the possible correlations between the distribution of the lesions on the
treated DNA and the distribution of mutations, we have located and quantified the
lesions induced by ultraviolet light (254 nm) on a SV40 DNA fragment. At a
fluence of 2,000 J/m2, our results show that the formation frequency of
thymine-thymine dimers (TT) is three to four times higher than the formation
frequency of the other types of dimers (TC, CT, CC). On the other hand, the
formation frequency of a dimer is influenced by the adjacent sequence. In
particular, a pyrimidine in the 5' position of a thymine-thymine dimer enhances
its formation frequency. At the dose used the formation frequency of the
pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts is twenty times less than the formation
frequency of pyrimidine dimers. This paper shows the distribution of the major
lesions induced by UV-light on a defined fragment of SV40 genome after UV
irradiation. This work is necessary to get an insight into the molecular
mechanisms of UV-mutagenesis.
