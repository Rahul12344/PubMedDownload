The Virology Laboratory of the Central Laboratory of Animal Diseases in Ivory
Coast at Bingerville received samples of wild and domestic avian species between 
February and December 2006. An RT-PCR technique was used to test for avian
influenza (AI) and highly pathogenic AI subtype viruses. Among 2125 samples, 16
were type A positive; of which, 12 were later confirmed to be H5N1. Fifteen of
these 16 type A positive samples were inoculated into the chorioallantoic cavity 
of 11-day-old embryonated hens' eggs for virus isolation. Eight produced virus
with hemagglutination titres from 1/64 to 1/512. The 4/16 M-RT-PCR positive
samples, which were H5N1 negative, were shown to be H7 subtype negative. The
diagnostic efficiency of the laboratory for the surveillance of H5N1 in Ivory
Coast was demonstrated. The positive cases of H5N1 were from a sparrowhawk
(Accipter nisus); live market poultry and in free-range poultry, where the
mortality rate was approximately 20% (2/10) and 96.7% (29/30) respectively.
Currently, investigations into intensive poultry farms have proved negative for
H5N1. No human cases have been reported this time.
