HIV infection is associated with immune dysfunction, perturbation of immune-cell 
subsets and opportunistic infections. CD161++ CD8+ T cells are a
tissue-infiltrating population that produce IL17A, IL22, IFN, and TNFα, cytokines
important in mucosal immunity. In adults they dominantly express the
semi-invariant TCR Vα7.2, the canonical feature of mucosal associated invariant T
(MAIT) cells and have been recently implicated in host defense against pathogens.
We analyzed the frequency and function of CD161++ /MAIT cells in peripheral blood
and tissue from patients with early stage or chronic-stage HIV infection. We show
that the CD161++ /MAIT cell population is significantly decreased in early HIV
infection and fails to recover despite otherwise successful treatment. We provide
evidence that CD161++ /MAIT cells are not preferentially infected but may be
depleted through diverse mechanisms including accumulation in tissues and
activation-induced cell death. This loss may impact mucosal defense and could be 
important in susceptibility to specific opportunistic infections in HIV.
