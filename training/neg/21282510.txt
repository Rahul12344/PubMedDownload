How the naive T cell repertoire arises and forms the memory repertoire is still
poorly understood. This relationship was analyzed by taking advantage of the
focused TCR usage in HLA-A2-restricted CD8 memory T cell responses to influenza
M1(58-66). We analyzed rearranged BV19 genes from CD8 single-positive thymocytes,
a surrogate for the naive repertoire, from 10 HLA-A2 individuals. CDR3 amino acid
sequences associated with response to influenza were observed at higher
frequencies than expected by chance, an indicator of preselection. We propose
that a rearrangement mechanism involving long P-nucleotide addition from the J2.7
region explains part of this increase. Special rearrangement mechanisms can
result in identical T cells in different individuals, referred to as public
responses. Indeed, the rearrangements utilizing long P nucleotide additions were 
commonly observed in the response to the M1(58-66) epitope in 30 HLA-A2
middle-aged adults. Thus, in addition to negative and positive selection, special
rearrangement mechanisms may influence the composition of the naive repertoire,
resulting in more robust responses to a pathogen in some individuals.
