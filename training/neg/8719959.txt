A strain of Trichomonas vaginalis infected with a double-stranded RNA virus
showed pronounced cytopathology in the form of giant syncytia generated by the
recruitment of single cells. The giant cells ultimately lysed, releasing virus
into the culture medium. In the infected cells, clusters of electron-dense
particles resembling viral structures were found in the cytoplasm. In addition,
distinctive inclusions composed of similar particles were present in the nuclei
of some cells. Double-stranded viral RNA of 5.5 kbp was demonstrated in both
cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from these cells. Viral particles collected
from the cell-free culture supernatant were of the same shape and size as the RNA
virus isolated from a strain of T. vaginalis described previously (Wang & Wang,
Journal of Biological Chemistry, 260: 3697-3702, 1985; Wang & Wang, Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.A. 83: 7956-7960, 1986) which does
not show this cytopathology.
