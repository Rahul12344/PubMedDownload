Cytopathic effects were produced in fetal rhesus monkey kidney (FRhK-4) cells 7
days postinfection by a serially BS-C-1-passaged strain of hepatitis A virus.
Typical enterovirus cytopathology was produced by the HM-175 strain after 15
passages at 7-day intervals in BS-C-1 cells. No cytopathic effects were obtained 
after neutralization of virus with human anti-hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin G.
Normal human serum had no effect on development of cytopathology. Maximum antigen
and cDNA probe-based hybridization activity were associated with a CsCl gradient 
fraction having a density of 1.34 g/cm3. Large quantities of 27- to 30-nm virions
typical of hepatitis A virus were associated with the same fraction. These data
led to the conclusion that the observed cytopathology was caused by hepatitis A
virus.
