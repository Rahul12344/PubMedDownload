The human retroviruses can be divided into oncovirus (HTLV-I and HTLV-II) and
lentivirus strains (HIV-1 and -2). The HTLVs are endemic in Central Africa, the
Caribbean Islands and in southwest Japan, but now tend to spread through the
i.v.-drug user population in the USA and in some countries in Western Europe.
HTLV infection is associated with a malignant form of adult T-cell leukemia,
tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) and an associated myelopathy (HAM). The
pathogenic mechanisms of HTLV are as yet poorly understood. HIV infection is
spreading rapidly almost world-wide and has reached epidemic proportions in
Central Africa, parts of South America and in certain populations in
industrialized countries that have risk behaviour for contracting venereal or
blood-borne infections. The mechanisms of HIV-induced immune suppression are
still not entirely clear, as direct T-lymphocyte destruction after viral
infection cannot account for the almost complete loss of CD4 T-cells in the final
stages of disease. Various indirect mechanisms of HIV-induced immune cell
destruction are outlined below.
