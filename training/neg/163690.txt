A comparison of the effects of daunomycin and adriamycin on various DNA
polymerases.

The effects of the anthracycline antiboties, daunomycin and adriamycin, on the
DNA-directed activities of DNA polymerases from murine sarcoma virus, rat liver
(high-molecular-weight species), Escherichia coli, and Micrococcus luteus were
determined. Under all conditions tested, these compounds had greater inhibitory
effect against the viral polymerase than against cellular polymerase. The
inhibition of murine sarcoma virus DNA polymerase by daunomycin was competitive
with respect to DNA. For viral DNA polymerase it was concluded that the
inhibition was predominatly caused by the interaction of duanomycin with the
primer-template DNA. Also, an appreciable reversal of the daunomycin-induced
inhibition of this polymerase by an increase in Mg-2+ concentration is consistent
with the conclusion derived by competition experiments. In contrast, the
inhibition of both rat liver and M. luteus DNA polymerases was essentially
noncompetitive with DNA. Also, bacterial enzymes wer e less sensitive to
inhibition by these drugs than the virion polymerase. The strong and preferential
inhibiton of viral DNA polymerase is discussed in relation to a differential
sensitivity of normal as compared to tumor cells observed in some cell lines.
