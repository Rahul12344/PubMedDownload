Rapid and reliable methods are fundamental for the comprehensive characterization
of emerging and evolving avian influenza viruses. Although microarrays provide
new possibilities with their parallel approach, their use in diagnostic
laboratories is still limited due to economical and practical factors. An
easy-to-use, low-cost microarray-based assay for haemagglutinin subtyping and
pathotyping of avian influenza viruses and specific detection of highly
pathogenic H5N1/Asia clade 2.2 is described as a novel diagnostic tool. The
ArrayTube platform is user-friendly, inexpensive and allows processing of many
samples. The sensitivity of the assay developed was comparable to real-time
RT-PCR, and the simultaneous detection of different subtypes was possible.
Validation with 90 influenza A virus isolates representing all 16 haemagglutinin 
subtypes and 44 field samples (cloacal swabs from wild and domestic birds)
demonstrated the feasibility of the system for sensitive and specific
characterization of AIV. Facilitating haemagglutinin subtyping and pathotyping
for the majority of influenza A-positive cloacal swabs within 24h, the new assay 
enables detailed AIV diagnosis even in less well-equipped laboratories.
