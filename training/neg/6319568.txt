Recovery of herpes simplex virus genetic information from human trigeminal
ganglion cells following superinfection with herpes simplex virus type 2
temperature-sensitive mutants.

Lewis ME, Brown SM, Warren KG, Subak-Sharpe JH.

Explant cultures of human trigeminal ganglia were derived from 36 individuals.
Those cultures which failed to release herpes simplex virus (HSV) spontaneously
were superinfected at various times after establishment in vitro with a range of 
HSV-2 temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants. Eight cultures from six individuals
contained HSV-specific genetic information which could be detected or rescued
following superinfection. Restriction enzyme analysis of ts+ virus recovered from
the ganglia of two individuals following superinfection was identical to that of 
endogenous HSV-1 spontaneously released from parallel cultures. Retrieval of ts+ 
virus by this technique suggests products of the superinfecting virus activated
expression of whole genomes or that spontaneous virus expression occurred
unrelated to the act of superinfection.
