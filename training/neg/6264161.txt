Rearrangement of integrated viral DNA sequences in mouse cells transformed by
simian virus 40.

Bender MA, Brockman WW.

The organization of viral DNA sequences in several cell lines derived from a
primary colony of simian virus 40 (SV40)-transformed mouse cells was analyzed to 
examine the origin of the various distinctive patterns of SV40 sequence
arrangement present in transformed cells. This analysis revealed a complex
arrangement of viral sequences in the uncloned transformed cells but simplified
arrangements in cloned derivatives of the primary transformant. The cell lines
studied had certain SV40 sequence arrangements in common, but the cloned lines
had lost some parental arrangements and acquired new arrangements. These results 
indicate that the arrangement of viral sequences in some SV40-transformed cells
is not fixed but that alterations occur after integration, creating a
heterogeneous population of transformants. In the process, expression of viral
genes may be altered. Possible causes for and implications of this genetic
instability are discussed.
