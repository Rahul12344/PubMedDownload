Bioadhesins are a recognised method of enhancing the absorption of drugs and
vaccines at mucosal surfaces. Additionally, bioadhesins allow for cell specific
targeting. Lectin-mediated targeting and delivery exploits unique surface
carbohydrates on mucosal epithelial cells. The antigen-sampling M cells offer a
portal for absorption of colloidal and particulate delivery vehicles, including
bacteria, viruses and inert microparticles. We review work supporting the use of 
lectins to aid targeting to intestinal M cells. Consideration is also given to
lectin-mediated targeting in non-intestinal sites and to the potential
application of other bioadhesins to enhance M cell transport. While substantial
hurdles must be overcome before mucosal bioadhesins can guarantee consistent,
safe, effective mucosal delivery, this strategy offers novel opportunities for
drug and vaccine formulation.
