Poria cocos has a long history of medicinal use in China. Polysaccharides and
their derivatives in the medicine exhibit many beneficial biological activities
including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral activities. In
this study, a new polysaccharide (PCP-II) was isolated from sclerotium of Poria
cocos. Its physico-chemical characters were identified and its adjuvant activity 
was investigated in mice co-immunized with H1N1 influenza vaccine and hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg). The results revealed that PCP-II has a molecular weight 
of 29.0kDa. It was composed of fucose, mannose, glucose and galactose in molar
ration of 1.00:1.63:0.16:6.29 respectively. Pharmacological data demonstrated
that PCP-II increased antigen-specific antibody levels in mice immunized with
influenza vaccine. PCP-II also elicited anti-HBsAg antibodies at significantly
higher titers and generated robust and durable immunity compared to mice
immunized with HBsAg-alum following two administrations. PCP-II improved
proliferation of splenocytes, stimulated IL-12p70 and TNF-α productions in
dendritic cells and macrophages respectively. These results suggested that
PCP-II-adjuvanted vaccines enhanced humoral and cellular immunity. PCP-II could
be developed as an efficacious adjuvant in human and animal vaccines.
