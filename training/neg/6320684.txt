A community waterborne gastroenteritis outbreak: evidence for rotavirus as the
agent.

Hopkins RS, Gaspard GB, Williams FP Jr, Karlin RJ, Cukor G, Blacklow NR.

A community waterborne nonbacterial gastroenteritis outbreak occurred in
Eagle-Vail, Colorado in March 1981. Illness (defined as vomiting and/or diarrhea)
was statistically associated with water consumption (chi 2 for linear trend =
7.07, p less than .005). Five of seven persons associated with the outbreak were 
infected with rotavirus as shown by virus detection or serological methods.
Bacterial pathogens, Giardia lamblia, and Norwalk virus were excluded as
responsible agents. Rotavirus should be looked for as a cause of waterborne
outbreaks.
