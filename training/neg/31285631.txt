We report neurodevelopmental outcomes in 216 infants followed since the time of
PCR-confirmed maternal Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnancy during the Rio de
Janeiro epidemic of 2015-2016 (refs. 1,2). Neurodevelopment was assessed by
Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition (Bayley-III;
cognitive, language and motor domains) in 146 children and through
neurodevelopment questionnaires/neurological examinations in 70 remaining
children. Complete eye exams (n = 137) and hearing assessments (n = 114) were
also performed. Below-average neurodevelopment and/or abnormal eye or hearing
assessments were noted in 31.5% of children between 7 and 32 months of age. Among
children assessed by Bayley-III, 12% scored below -2 s.d. (score <70; a score of 
100 ± 2 s.d. is the range) in at least one domain; and 28% scored between -1 and 
-2 s.d. in any domain (scores <85-70). Language function was most affected, with 
35% of 146 children below average. Improved neurodevelopmental outcomes were
noted in female children, term babies, children with normal eye exams and
maternal infection later in pregnancy (P = 0.01). We noted resolution of
microcephaly with normal neurodevelopment in two of eight children, development
of secondary microcephaly in two other children and autism spectrum disorder in
three previously healthy children in the second year of life.
