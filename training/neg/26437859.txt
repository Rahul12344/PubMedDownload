BACKGROUND: Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) are herpesviruses that infect many mammalian
species, including humans. Infection generally passes undetected, but the virus
can cause serious disease in individuals with impaired immune function. Human CMV
(HCMV) is circulating with high seroprevalence (60-100 %) on all continents.
However, little information is available on HCMV genoprevalence and genetic
diversity in subsaharan Africa, especially in rural areas of West Africa that are
at high risk of human-to-human HCMV transmission. In addition, there is a
potential for zoonotic spillover of pathogens through bushmeat hunting and
handling in these areas as shown for various retroviruses. Although HCMV and
nonhuman CMVs are regarded as species-specific, potential human infection with
CMVs of non-human primate (NHP) origin, shown to circulate in the local NHP
population, has not been studied.
FINDINGS: Analysis of 657 human oral swabs and fecal samples collected from 518
individuals living in 8 villages of Côte d'Ivoire with generic PCR for
identification of human and NHP CMVs revealed shedding of HCMV in 2.5 % of the
individuals. Determination of glycoprotein B sequences showed identity with
strains Towne, AD169 and Toledo, respectively. NHP CMV sequences were not
detected.
CONCLUSIONS: HCMV is actively circulating in a proportion of the rural Côte
d'Ivoire human population with circulating strains being closely related to those
previously identified in non-African countries. The lack of NHP CMVs in human
populations in an environment conducive to cross-species infection supports
zoonotic transmission of CMVs to humans being at most a rare event.
