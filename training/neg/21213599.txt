Two cell lines, named KCEK and KCEL, were established from chicken embryonic
kidney and lung. The basal culture medium was newly developed and the cell growth
medium consisted of K1999 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated chicken serum.
Both cells were well adapted to grow in vitro and more than 50 passages have been
made so far. Once the cell lines were established the cells were easily adapted
to grow in other growth media supplemented with fetal calf serum. Neither tumor
formation in chicks nor P52 avian leucosis common antigen was detected in these
cells. However, the oncogene analysis on these cells has not been performed yet. 
Both cells were permissive hosts for the Aujeszky's disease virus, Newcastle
disease virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus.
