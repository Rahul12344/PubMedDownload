Glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins contain in their
COOH-terminal region a peptide segment that is thought to direct glycolipid
addition. This signal has been shown to require a pair of small amino acids
positioned 10-12 residues upstream of an hydrophobic C-terminal domain. We
analysed the contribution of the region separating the anchor acceptor site and
the C-terminal hydrophobic segment by introducing amino acid deletions and
substitutions in the spacer element of the GPI-anchored Thy-1 glycoprotein.
Deletions of 7 amino acids in this region, as well as the introduction of 2
charged residues, prevented the glycolipid addition to Thy-1, suggesting that the
length and the primary sequence of the spacer domain are important determinants
in the signal directing GPI anchor transfer onto a newly synthesized polypeptide.
Furthermore, we tested these rules by creating a truncated form of the normally
transmembranous Herpes simplex virus I glycoprotein D (gDI) and demonstrating
that when its C-terminal region displays all the features of a GPI-anchored
protein, it is able to direct glycolipid addition onto another cell surface
molecule.
