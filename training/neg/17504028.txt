In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of 19-25 nucleotides noncoding RNAs,
have been shown to play a major role in gene regulation across a broad range of
metazoans and are important for a diverse biological functions. These miRNAs are 
involved in the regulation of protein expression primarily by binding to one or
more target sites on an mRNA transcript and causing cleavage or repression of
translation. Computer-based approaches for miRNA gene identification and miRNA
target prediction are being considered as indispensable in miRNA research.
Similarly, effective experimental techniques validating in silico predictions are
crucial to the testing and finetuning of computational algorithms. Iterative
interactions between in silico and experimental methods are now playing a central
role in the biology of miRNAs. In this review, we summarize the various
computational methods for identification of miRNAs and their targets as well as
the technologies that have been developed to validate the predictions.
