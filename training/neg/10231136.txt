Human herpesvirus 8 is a gammaherpesvirus which may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of multiple myeloma. Viral DNA sequences have been found in the bone
marrow, peripheral blood and leukapheresis products of myeloma patients. These
findings have significant implications for the use of leukapheresed cells in the 
transplantation and immunotherapy of myeloma. The studies suggest the cell which 
harbours the virus may be dendritic in origin. We have previously reported that
dendritic cells cultured for use in the clinical setting do not harbour HHV-8. In
this study, we examined the leukapheresis products of a larger cohort of myeloma 
patients for the presence of HHV-8 using a highly sensitive PCR technique. A
strong association between HHV-8 and myeloma was not confirmed, with only 4% of
the patient samples positive for viral sequences. While further study is needed, 
the current use of apheresis cells and their cultured progeny in the treatment of
myeloma should not be compromised.
