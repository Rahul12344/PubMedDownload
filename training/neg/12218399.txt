The baseline characteristics of antiretroviral-naive patients were compared by
ethnic/racial groups. First CD4 T cell counts were lower for Latino (P = 0.0004) 
and black patients (P = 0.10) when compared with white patients. First HIV-1-RNA 
levels were higher in Latino patients (P = 0.08), who were also more likely to
present with major opportunistic infections (P < 0.004). Once in care, changes in
CD4 T cell counts and viral loads over time did not differ significantly between 
groups.
