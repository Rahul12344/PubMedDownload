Background: Human enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was first isolated in 1962 and has
aroused public concern recently because of a nationwide outbreak among children
in 2014-2015 in the USA. The symptoms include fever, runny nose, sneezing, cough 
and muscle pains. It might be associated with severe respiratory illness in
individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions and its potential
association with acute flaccid myelitis is under investigation. In Asia, EV-D68
cases have been reported in several countries.
The study: We aimed to understand the EV-D68 prevalence and their genetic
diversity in Hong Kong children.
Methods: A total of 10â€‰695 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples from
hospitalised patients aged <18 years were collected from September 2014 to
December 2015 in two regional hospitals. NPAs tested positive for
enterovirus/rhinovirus (EV/RV) were selected for genotyping. For those identified
as EV-D68, their complete coding sequences (CDSs) were obtained by Sanger
sequencing. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was constructed using all EV-D68
complete coding sequences available in GenBank (n=482).
Results: 2662/10 695 (24.9%) were tested positive with EV/RV and 882/2662 (33.1%)
were selected randomly and subjected to molecular classification. EV-D68 was
detected in 15 (1.70%) samples from patients with clinical presentations ranging 
from wheezing to pneumonia and belonged to subclade B3. Eight CDSs were
successfully obtained. A total of 10 amino acid residue polymorphisms were
detected in the viral capsid proteins, proteases, ATPase and RNA polymerase.
Conclusion: B3 subclade was the only subclade found locally. Surveillance of
EV-D68 raises public awareness and provides the information to determine the most
relevant genotypes for vaccine development.
