BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Currently, HTLV screening is not performed in South
Africa (SA). This report describes an economic assessment (budget impact and
cost-effectiveness) of implementing different HTLV screening strategies.
METHODS: A modified version of the Alliance of Blood Operators risk-based
decision-making framework was used to assess the risk and consequences of HTLV in
the blood supply in SA. We developed a deterministic model of the cost and
consequences of four screening strategies: none, universal, all donors once and
first time donors only assuming a transfusion-transmission (TT) efficiency of 10%
and a manifestation of clinical disease of 6%.
RESULTS: Unscreened blood results in 3·55 symptomatic TT-HTLV cases and a total
healthcare cost of Rand (R)3 446 950 (US Dollars (USD)229 800) annually.
Universal screening would cost R24 000 000 (USD1 600 000) per annum and prevent
3·54 (99·8%) symptomatic TT-HTLV cases in the first year and 0·55 (98·4%)
symptomatic TT-HTLV cases in the second year at a cost per TT-HTLV prevented of
R6 780 000 (USD450 000) in year one and R43 254 000 (USD2 890 000) in year two.
Screening all donors once would cost R16,200,000 (USD1 080 000) or R4 600 000
(USD306 000) per symptomatic TT-HTLV infection prevented in year one. Total costs
decrease to R5 100 000 (USD340 000) in year 2 but the cost per TT-HTLV prevented 
increases to R10 700 000 (USD713 333).
CONCLUSION: This analysis contributed to the decision not to implement HTLV
screening as the healthcare budget and particularly the budget for blood
transfusion in SA is insufficient to provide appropriate treatment. Arguably,
available resources can be more efficiently utilized in other healthcare
programs.
