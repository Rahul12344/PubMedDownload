Atypical measles and enhanced respiratory syncytial virus disease (ERD) were
serious diseases that resulted from exposure of children immunized with
inactivated vaccines against measles virus (MV) and respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) to the respective wild-type agents in the 1960s. Although the clinical
manifestations of both illnesses were different, the immune responses elicited
and primed for by the vaccines shared important similarities. Both vaccines
failed to elicit long-lived protective antibody and to promote cytotoxic T
lymphocyte responses. In both cases, postvaccination exposure to wild type virus 
during community outbreaks was associated with immune complex deposition in
affected tissues, vigorous CD4 T lymphocyte proliferative responses, and a Th2
bias of the immune response. No relapses of atypical measles or ERD were ever
reported. In this manuscript, the pathogeneses of both enhanced diseases and the 
requirements for the generation of protective antibodies against MV and RSV are
discussed, to contribute to the development of newer safe and effective vaccines 
against these important pathogens.
