Recent studies underscore the importance of crosstalk between tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) and tumor cells in cancer progression and metastasis. In our
study, AdCD68STAT3β, a recombinant adenovirus containing a STAT3β gene driven by 
CD68 macrophage-specific promoter, was used to suppress STAT3 and the downstream 
signaling pathways in TAMs. The results showed that STAT3β gene under the control
of CD68 macrophage-specific promoter was only expressed in macrophages, which
significantly inhibited the motility and invasion of breast cancer cells when
co-cultured with 4T1 cells. Moreover, cell-specific STAT3β expression in TAMs
extended survival of tumor-bearing mice and suppressed breast tumor growth,
angiogenesis and metastasis, by regulating the crosstalk between tumor cells and 
TAMs. Therefore, our study provided a novel strategy for the antitumor effects of
STAT3β.
