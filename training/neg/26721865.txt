The endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis infects many species of insects
and has been transinfected into the mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.), the primary
vector of dengue virus (DENV). Recently, it has been shown that Wolbachia blocks 
the replication and transmission of RNA viruses, such as DENV, in a number of
mosquito species including Ae. aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Skuse), which is
naturally infected with Wolbachia and considered a secondary vector for DENV. The
mosquito species Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) is highly prevalent in Australia,
including in areas where DENV outbreaks have been recorded. The mosquito has been
implicated in the transmission of Ross River and Barmah Forest viruses, but not
DENV. We investigated whether Wolbachia naturally infects this mosquito species
and whether it has an impact on the ability of Ae. notoscriptus to transmit DENV.
We show, for the first time, that Ae. notoscriptus is naturally infected with a
strain of Wolbachia that belongs to supergroup B and is localized only in the
ovaries. However, Wolbachia infection in Ae. notoscriptus did not induce
resistance to DENV and had no effect on overall DENV infection rate or titer. The
presence of a native Wolbachia in Ae. notoscriptus cannot explain why this
mosquito is an ineffective vector of DENV.
