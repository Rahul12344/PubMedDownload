BACKGOUND/AIM: Studies associating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with
lipid profile and hepatic steatosis in children and adolescents are scarce. This 
study investigated lipid profile abnormalities and hepatic steatosis among
HCV-infected Egyptian children and adolescents who survived leukemia and lymphoma
and evaluated impact on response to antiviral therapy.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six leukemia/lymphoma cured children and adolescents
(mean age: 12.47 ± 3.56 years) with chronic HCV infection and 30 healthy controls
(mean age: 11.64 ± 3.96 years) were enrolled in this prospective study. Serum
lipid profile and abdominal ultrasonography were done for all patients and
controls. Guided liver biopsy with histopathological examination was done for 32 
(88.9%) patients eligible for antiviral therapy.
RESULTS: Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apo-B) in
patients were significantly lower than in the control group (P ≤ .01, ≤ .01, and 
≤ .05, respectively). Among those who underwent liver biopsy (n = 32),
macrovesicular hepatic steatosis associated with chronic hepatitis C was
documented in 10 children (31.3%). Body mass index was significantly higher (P ≤ 
.05) and apo-B was significantly lower in steatotic (P ≤ .05) than non-steatotic 
HCV-infected children. Liver span by ultrasound, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
and apo-B were independent predictors for hepatic steatosis (P < .001, <.001, and
<.05, respectively). A significantly worse response to interferon alpha 2-b plus 
ribavrin treatment for HCV was reported among children with steatosis (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed low serum lipids in HCV-infected children with
cured leukemia/lymphoma. Hepatic steatosis was found in a significant proportion 
of patients and was associated with a poor response to antiviral treatment.
