In the course of screening for inhibitors of reverse transcriptase, we have
isolated an inhibitor from a strain of Nocardia and identified it as sakyomicin
A. The antibiotic blocks avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase
reaction: IC50 was ca. 30 micrograms/ml by the method employed. The drug affects 
proliferation of HTLV-III/LAV in HTLV-I-carrying MT-4 cells: ca. 60% inhibition
was observed at an antibiotic concentration of 1.0 microgram/ml and ca. 20%
inhibition at 0.1 microgram/ml, and there was no significant cytotoxicity.
