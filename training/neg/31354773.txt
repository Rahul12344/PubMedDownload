Plants are often simultaneously exposed to diverse environmental stresses, and
can tune suitable responses to them through hormones. Salicylic acid (SA) and
jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways are known to enhance resistance against
heat stress and tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus (TYLCTHV) infection.
However, there is limited information regarding alternative natural priming
agents against heat stress and viruses. In this study, two plant-derived priming 
agents, eugenol and anise oil, were tested for their roles in conferring
thermotolerance and virus resistance in tomato plants. Under heat stress, the
survival rates and average fresh weight were higher in plants treated with
eugenol or anise oil than in control plants. These two priming agents were
further tested for antiviral activities. After TYLCTHV infection, the disease
incidence and relative abundance of TYLCTHV were lower in anise oil- and
eugenol-treated plants than in control plants. Further analyses revealed that a
few SA, JA, and RNA silencing genes were enhanced in the former. Moreover, SA,
JA, and H2O2 contents increased considerably after eugenol and anise oil
treatments. Our findings imply that anise oil and eugenol initiated SA- and
JA-mediated defenses to promote thermotolerance and antiviral responses of tomato
plants.
