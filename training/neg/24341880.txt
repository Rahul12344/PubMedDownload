Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and severe
complication of natalizumab therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis and it
may be accompanied by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). Here,
we describe a case of abnormally severe IRIS, which occurred 2 months after
natalizumab-associated PML in a 38-year-old woman affected by multiple sclerosis.
The patient was John Cunningham virus-positive and was treated for 21 months when
she developed PML. The subsequent IRIS diffusely afflicted the brain, producing
edema and signs of intracranial hypertension, with a clinically severe form
compromising the state of consciousness, requiring intensive care and high-dosage
steroid treatment. Nevertheless, she survived and partially recovered. There is
still difficulty in differentiating PML progression from IRIS onset and there is 
not a clear description in the literature about different clinical forms of IRIS,
prognostic factors and guidelines to properly treat this complication in order to
reduce the residual disability of the patient surviving this treatment
complication.
