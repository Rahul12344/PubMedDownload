Purification and properties of single strand DNA-binding endo-exonuclease of
Neurospora crassa.

Chow TY, Fraser MJ.

Single strand DNA-binding endo-exonucleases purified from mitochondria, vacuoles,
or a mixture of these organelles had the same high specific single strand DNase
activity (910 mumol of nucleotides/min/mg), and each contained a polypeptide of
Mr = 31,000-33,000 which was found to be active by sodium dodecyl sulfate-DNA-gel
electrophoresis. The properties of the three preparations were identical in all
respects tested. The enzyme showed distributive endonuclease activity with single
strand DNA, but processive exonuclease activity with double strand DNA. In the
former case, 5'-phosphoryl-terminated fragments were released at early times,
while in the latter case, short 5'-oligonucleotides (n = 2-4) were released. Both
activities were dependent on Mg2+ (or Mn2+), but to different extents. In 0.1 mM 
Mg2+, superhelical bacteriophage phi X174 (replicative form (RF II) DNA and, at
converted to relaxed circular (RF II) DNA and, at higher enzyme concentrations,
to unit length linear (RF III) DNA. In 10 mM Mg2+, these same conversions took
place rapidly, and the RF III DNA which formed was degraded to pieces shorter
than unit length. At very low enzyme concentrations, long single strand tails and
gaps were detected in bacteriophage T7 linear double strand DNA molecules.
