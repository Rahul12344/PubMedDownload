Near full-length genomes of 4 unclassified HIV-1 variants infecting patients
enrolled in an antenatal cohort in Canada were obtained by sequencing. All 4
variants showed original recombination profiles, including A1/A2/J, A1/D, and
A1/G/J/CRF11_cpx structures. Identification of these variants highlights the
growing prevalence of unique recombinant forms of HIV-1 in North America.
