Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and p53 cellular protein were isolated
from an SV40-transformed hamster cell line by immunoprecipitation with anti-T
sera and purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. These two
protein were tested in hamsters for the presence of SV40 transplantation
rejection antigenic sites by in vivo transplantation rejection assay. The large T
antigen immunized the hamsters against a challenge of SV40 tumor cells and the
protected animals generated cytotoxic spleen cells. Hamsters immunized with the
p53 cellular protein were not protected against SV40-induced tumor but there was 
some delay in the appearance of tumor.
