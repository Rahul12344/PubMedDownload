To characterize the responses of raccoons to West Nile virus (WNV) infection, we 
subcutaneously exposed them to WNV. Moderately high viremia titers (â‰¤ 10(4.6)
plaque forming units [PFU]/mL of serum) were noted in select individuals;
however, peak viremia titers were variable and viremia was detectable in some
individuals as late as 10 days post-inoculation (DPI). In addition, fecal
shedding was prolonged in some animals (e.g., between 6 and 13 DPI in one
individual), with up to 10(5.0) PFU/fecal swab detected. West Nile virus was not 
detected in tissues collected on 10 or 16 DPI, and no histologic lesions
attributable to WNV infection were observed. Overall, viremia profiles suggest
that raccoons are unlikely to be important WNV amplifying hosts. However, this
species may occasionally shed significant quantities of virus in feces.
Considering their behavioral ecology, including repeated use of same-site
latrines, high levels of fecal shedding could potentially lead to interspecies
fecal-oral WNV transmission.
