Recombination is a driving force for the emergence, evolution and
virulence/epidemics of viruses, comprising the Enterovirus genus of the
Picornaviridae family, important for human and animal health. By analyzing 2949
complete genomes/coding sequences, we provide a thorough and up-to-date overview 
of the genome-wide patterns and hotspots of intertypic recombination between the 
genogroups of this genus. Two prominent recombination hotspots are
identified/verified, at the 5'UTR-capsid region junction, and at the beginning of
the P2 region. In general, P2 was enriched in recombination events. Key
phylogenetic groups implicated in recombination events are E71 and CVA6 in
Enterovirus A species, E30 and E6 in Enterovirus B species, polioviruses 1 and 2 
in Enterovirus C species. In addition, many events involve recombination partners
that have not been sequenced yet, thus strongly suggesting a large environmental 
reservoir of genetic variation with a high potential for the emergence of new
modified pathogens by recombination.
