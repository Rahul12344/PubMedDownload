Meat and skin from farmed ostriches are valuable products for European consumers.
The EU regulations require that ostrich products deamed for export need to come
from ostriches that are free of antibodies against Newcastle disease virus (avian
paramxovirus type 1, aPMV-1). After the detection of antibodies against aPMV-1 in
one of five ostrich farms in Namibia, attempts were made to isolate the causative
virus. No aPMV-1 but an avian paramyxovirus type 3 (aPMV-3) was isolated from
five pharyngeal/cloacal swabs of clinically healthy farmed Namibian ostriches.
Subtype determination proved that all isolates are members of the subtype aPMV-3 
of psittacine bird origin and were designated as aPMV-3b. In the
haemagglutination inhibition test, the aPMV-3b isolates cross-reacted with
aPMV-1. This allows the conclusion that the antibodies originally detected in
sera of the ostriches are due to the cross-reaction with aPMV-3b, rather than to 
an infection with aPMV-1.To our knowledge, this is the first description of the
occurrence of aPMV-3b in farmed ostriches.
