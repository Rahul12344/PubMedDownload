OBJECTIVE: To construct the recombinant fowlpox virus expressing Eimeria tenella 
F2 hybrid strain SO7 gene.
METHODS: A recombinant expression plasmid pUTA-SO7 was constructed by inserting
the SO7 gene of Eimeria tenella F2 hybrid strain into downstream of a hybrid
poxvirus promoter which was flanked by the TK gene of fowlpox virus (FPV). The
constructed pUTA-SO7 was firstly transfected into chicken embryo fibroblast
cells(CEF) pre-infected with FPV strain 282E4 by using liposome, then the viruses
resulted from the transfection were selected for 2 passages by culturing in CEF
cells with MEM medium containing 40 mg/L 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). The
selected viruses were plaque-purified in CEF cultured with MEM medium without
BrdU. RESULTS Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indirect immunofluorescence assay 
and Western blotting showed that S07 gene was expressed in recombinant fowlpox
virus.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant FPV (rFPV) expressing the SO7 gene has been obtained.
