The cytokine interleukin-21 (IL-21) regulates viral pathogenesis in individuals
infected with human and simian immunodeficiency viruses. However, because the
time of initial infection with HIV in humans is rarely known, the dynamics of
IL-21 production during the first weeks have not been adequately explored. In the
present study, we used rhesus macaques to model the first stages of infection.
Twenty-two rhesus macaques were infected rectally with simian-human
immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-1157ipd3N4, and for 12Â weeks, replication of the
virus, the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the levels of plasma IL-21 were 
monitored. Our study demonstrated that plasma levels of IL-21 increased during
the early phase of SHIV infection when compared with the values observed before
inoculation. We conclude that IL-21 has a likely role in the immunopathogenesis
of HIV/SIV/SHIV.
