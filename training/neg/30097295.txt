Zika virus is an emerging infection transmitted in multiple ways. In 2016 we
assessed the level of knowledge about Zika virus transmission in an underserved, 
predominantly Hispanic, mixed gender population living in suburban New York City,
many of whom potentially travel to affected regions. Based on a convenience
sample of 147 participants, 134 (91%) were aware of Zika virus transmission by
mosquitoes; 116 (79%) knew about transmission from a pregnant female to the
fetus; and 89 (61%) were aware of sexual transmission. Age, marital status,
education, and native language were unrelated to knowledge (P > 0.10). Women,
however, were significantly more likely than men to know about sexual
transmission (P = 0.023) and about maternal transmission to the fetus
(P = 0.044). Travel to Zika virus endemic areas was unrelated to level of
knowledge (P = 0.40). Greater awareness of the risk of sexual transmission of
Zika virus is needed for at risk populations in the US, especially for males.
