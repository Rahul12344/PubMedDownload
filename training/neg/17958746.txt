BACKGROUND: The mechanisms responsible for thrombocytopenia associated with
dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhage fever (DHF) remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the pathogenic effects of dengue virus 
(DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) on the elicitation of platelet
cross-reactive antibodies.
RESULTS: The results showed that anti-DENV NS1 immunoglobulins (Igs) derived from
both patients with DF/DHF and recombinant NS1-immunized rabbits could opsonize
normal human platelets and enhance platelet-macrophage engagements in vitro. In
addition, treatments with anti-NS1 Igs abnormally activated human platelets and
induced thrombocytopenia in mice. These prothrombotic characteristics of anti-NS1
Ig might increase the disease burden of coagulant-aberrant DHF patients. To test 
this hypothesis, we injected anti-NS1 Igs into C57BL/6J mice that were
preconditioned into a hypercoagulable state by warfarin treatments. When given
before but not after platelet-lysate pre-adsorption, the anti-NS1 Igs injection
treatments significantly increased mortality, fibrin deposition in lung, and
plasma D-dimer levels, but significantly decreased anticoagulant proteins C,
protein S and antithrombin III.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the platelet-bound antibody fractions of 
anti-NS1 Ig are prothrombotic, which might exacerbate the severity of disease in 
hosts with an imbalanced coagulant system.
