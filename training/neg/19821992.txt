BACKGROUND: Conserved neutralizing epitopes are considered to be a key role for
eliciting broadly neutralizing antibody (NAb). Previously, two conserved
neutralizing epitopes of HIV-1 CRF01_AE envelope were identified at amino acid
93-112 of the C1 (C1E) and at 218-239 of the C2 (C2E) regions. To access the
potency of antibody directed against conserved epitopes, a monoclonal antibody
(MAb) specific to the C2E region was developed and characterized.
METHODS: The immunogenicity of two epitopes was examined by immunizing BALB/c
mice with the matching synthetic peptides. One MAb, C2EB5, directed against
peptide C2E, was generated by conventional methods, while C1E1 and C1E2 peptides 
induced slight antibody response in mice. The neutralizing activity of MAb C2EB5 
was examined using a peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) based method and
various HIV-1 subtypes including A, B, C, D, and CRF01_AE; C2EB5 was compared
with other known neutralizing MAbs (4E10, 447-52D) and with sCD4. The exposure of
the C2 epitope on native virus was investigated using virus capture by these
MAbs.
RESULTS: The MAb C2EB5 demonstrated cross-neutralization against various HIV-1
subtypes. The overall potency of MAb C2EB5 against 5 subtypes was ranked in the
following order: subtype C> CRF01_AE> subtype D> subtype A> subtype B. The
epitope exposure for MAb C2EB5 was also correlated with the neutralization
properties of each subtype.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the cross-clade neutralizing activity of a
MAb directed against an epitope located in the C2 region of the HIV-1 env and
highlights differences in the exposure of antigenic epitopes on the surface of
various HIV-1 subtypes. The epitope for this newly identified neutralizing MAb
made against a subtype CRF01_AE peptide is particularly exposed in subtype C
viral isolates.
