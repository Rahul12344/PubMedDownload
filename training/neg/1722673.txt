B- and T-epitopes have been localized within the protective fragments of VP1
protein, viz., 136-152 of the O1K strain and 135-159 of the A22 strain of the
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Antibodies eliciting after immunization of
various animals with the 135-159 A22 peptide are directed to different sites of
the peptide. Immunogenicity of fragments of the 135-159 A22 peptide on mice
correlates with their activity on T-cells of the same animals and protective
activity on guinea pigs. The investigations were carried out using synthetic
fragments of the 136-152-O1K and 135-159-A22 peptides.
