Persistent excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid was found in a 6-month-old infant
with multiple minor physical malformations and delayed development. During two
episodes of intercurrent viral illness, the patient developed severe metabolic
acidosis and excreted large amounts of lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate and
acetoacetate. The excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid did not change during
these episodes, nor did it increase following leucine loading. In vitro studies
suggest that in this patient, as in the majority of other patients with
3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a primary defect in leucine metabolism is not
responsible for the biochemical abnormality.
