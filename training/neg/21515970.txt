OBJECTIVE: To identify patient-care practices related to an increased prevalence 
of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among chronic hemodialysis patients.
DESIGN: Survey.
SETTING: Chronic hemodialysis facilities in the United States.
PARTICIPANTS: Equal-probability 2-stage cluster sampling was used to select 87
facilities from all Medicare-approved providers treating 30-150 patients; 53
facilities and 2,933 of 3,680 eligible patients agreed to participate.
METHODS: Patients were tested for HCV antibody and HCV RNA. Data on patient-care 
practices were collected using direct observation.
RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HCV infection was 9.9% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 8.2%-11.6%); only 2 of 294 HCV-positive patients were detected
solely by HCV RNA testing. After adjusting for non-dialysis-related HCV risk
factors, patient-care practices independently associated with a higher prevalence
of HCV infection included reusing priming receptacles without disinfection (odds 
ratio [OR], 2.3 [95% CI, 1.4-3.9]), handling blood specimens adjacent to
medications and clean supplies (OR, 2.2 [95% CI, 1.3-3.6]), and using mobile
carts to deliver injectable medications (OR, 1.7 [95% CI, 1.0-2.8]).
Independently related facility covariates were at least 10% patient HCV infection
prevalence (OR, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.8-5.2]), patient-to-staff ratio of at least 7 : 1 
(OR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.4-4.1]), and treatment duration of at least 2 years (OR, 2.4 
[95% CI, 1.3-4.4]).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first epidemiologic evidence of associations
between specific patient-care practices and higher HCV infection prevalence among
hemodialysis patients. Staff should review practices to ensure that
hemodialysis-specific infection control practices are being implemented,
especially handling clean and contaminated items in separate areas, reusing items
only if disinfected, and prohibiting mobile medication and clean supply carts
within treatment areas.
