Two new secondary metabolites, labindole A [2-methyl-3-(2-nitroethyl)-3H-indole] 
(1) and labindole B [2-methyl-3-(2-nitrovinyl)-3H-indole] (2), were isolated from
the myxobacterium Labilithrixluteola (DSM 27648T). Additionally, four metabolites
3, 4, 5 and 6 already known from other sources were obtained. Their structures
were elucidated from high resolution electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry
(HRESIMS) and 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data and
their relative configuration was assigned based on nuclear Overhauser effect
(NOE) and vicinal Â¹H-NMR coupling data. The compounds where tested for biological
activities; labindoles A (1) and B (2) exhibited significant activity against
Hepatitis C Virus, 9H-carbazole (3), 3-chloro-9H-carbazole (4) and
4-hydroxymethyl-quinoline (5) showed antifungal activities. Moreover, compound 3 
had weak to moderate antibacterial activities, while labindoles A (1) and B (2)
were devoid of significant antifungal and antibacterial effects.
