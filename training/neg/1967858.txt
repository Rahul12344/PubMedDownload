An unusual posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is reported occurring
within 6 weeks of a heart-lung transplantation, in a patient with primary
exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus. The tumor presented primarily in the lung
allograft as a rapidly fatal bronchopneumonia refractory to antimicrobial
therapy. The viral genome was detected within the lesion by Southern blot
analysis, and a primary infection was confirmed by serologic studies. Restriction
fragment length polymorphism analysis using the LAM 4-1214 probe demonstrated
that the tumor infiltrate in the allograft lung was derived not from the donor's 
bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue but from recipient lymphocytes trafficking
through the allograft.
