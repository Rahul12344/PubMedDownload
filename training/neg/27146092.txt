The movement protein NSm of Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (TSWV) plays pivotal
roles in viral intercellular trafficking. Recently, the TSWV NSm was also
identified as an avirulence (Avr) determinant during the Sw-5b-mediated
hypersensitive response (HR). However, whether the cell-to-cell movement of NSm
is coupled to its function in HR induction remains obscure. Here, we showed that 
the NSm mutants defective in targeting plasmodesmata and cell-to-cell movement
were still capable of inducing Sw-5b-mediated HR. In addition, introduction of a 
single amino-acid substitution, C118Y or T120N, identified previously from TSWV
resistance-breaking isolates, into the movement-defective NSm mutants resulted in
the failure of HR induction. Collectively, our results showed that the
intercellular trafficking of NSm is uncoupled from its function in HR induction. 
These findings shed light on the evolutionary mechanism of R-Avr recognition and 
may be used to explain why this uncoupled phenomenon can be observed in many
different viruses.
