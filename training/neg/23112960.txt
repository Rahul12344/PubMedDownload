Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, and has spread into
Madagascar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) of the
family Bunyaviridae, genus Phlebovirus causes hemorrhagic fever, neurological
disorders or blindness in humans, and high rate abortion and fetal malformation
in ruminants. RVFV is classified as a Category A Priority pathogen and overlap
select agent by CDC/USDA due to its potential impact on public health and
agriculture. There is a gap in the safety and immunogenicity in traditional RVF
vaccines; the formalin-inactivated RVFV vaccine TSI-GSD-200 requires three doses 
for protection, and the live-attenuated Smithburn vaccine has a risk to cause
abortion and fetal malformation in pregnant ruminants. In this review, problems
of traditional vaccines and the safety and efficacy of recently reported novel
RVF candidate vaccines including subunit vaccines, virus vector, and replicons
are discussed.
