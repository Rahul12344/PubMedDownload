Multiple-type human papillomaviruses (HPV) infection presents a greater risk for 
persistence in asymptomatic individuals and may accelerate cancer development. To
extend the scope of HPV types defined by probe-based assays, multiplexing deep
sequencing of HPV L1, coupled with an HPV-QUEST genotyping server and a
bioinformatic pipeline, was established and applied to survey the diversity of
HPV genotypes among a subset of healthy men from the HPV in Men (HIM)
Multinational Study. Twenty-one HPV genotypes (12 high-risk and 9 low-risk) were 
detected in the genital area from 18 asymptomatic individuals. A single HPV type,
either HPV16, HPV6b or HPV83, was detected in 7 individuals, while coinfection by
2 to 5 high-risk and/or low-risk genotypes was identified in the other 11
participants. In two individuals studied for over one year, HPV16 persisted,
while fluctuations of coinfecting genotypes occurred. HPV L1 regions were
generally identical between query and reference sequences, although nonsynonymous
and synonymous nucleotide polymorphisms of HPV16, 18, 31, 35h, 59, 70, 73,
cand85, 6b, 62, 81, 83, cand89 or JEB2 L1 genotypes, mostly unidentified by
linear array, were evident. Deep sequencing coupled with HPV-QUEST provides
efficient and unambiguous classification of HPV genotypes in multiple-type HPV
infection in host ecosystems.
