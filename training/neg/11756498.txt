The neurotrophin receptor p75 can induce apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. The
mechanisms by which p75 induces apoptosis have remained mostly unknown. Here, we 
report that p75 activates Rac GTPase, which in turn activates c-jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK), including an injury-specific JNK3, in an NGF-dependent manner.
N17Rac blocks this JNK activation and subsequent NGF-dependent apoptosis,
indicating that activation of Rac GTPase is required for JNK activation and
apoptosis induced by p75. In addition, p75-mediated Rac activation is modulated
by coactivation of Trk, identifying Rac GTPase as one of the key molecules whose 
activity is critical for cell survival and death in neurotrophin signaling. The
crucial role of the JNK pathway in p75 signaling is further confirmed by the
results that blocking p75 from signaling via the JNK pathway or suppressing the
JNK activity itself led to inhibition of NGF-dependent death. Together, these
results indicate that the apoptotic machinery of p75 comprises Rac GTPase and
JNK.
