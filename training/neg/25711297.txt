Lower nadir CD4 cell counts and higher HIV viral loads are associated with
increased risks of adverse events in the progression of HIV disease. In cases
where medical records are inaccessible or incomplete, little evidence is
available regarding whether nadir CDR cell count or HIV viral load is reliably
reported in any patient population. We compare survey data collected from 207
HIV-infected individuals detained in San Francisco jails to data collected from
electronic medical records (EMR) kept by the jails and community health
providers. The sensitivity of self-reported nadir CD4 cell count less than 200
was 82 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 68, 88], and the sensitivity of reporting
an undetectable most recent HIV viral load was 93 % (95 % CI 84, 97). This
suggests that in a highly socially marginalized population, nadir CD4 cell count 
and most recent HIV viral load are recalled accurately when compared to EMR.
