In the last decade, chikungunya virus has emerged from an obscure arbovirus that 
caused limited outbreaks of disease in Africa and Asia to the cause of a pandemic
affecting millions of people and spanning five continents. Two separate
chikungunya virus genotypes have been responsible for outbreaks during this
period, including strains adapted to transmission in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes.
Further spread of this virus into new regions of the Western Hemisphere is
predicted during the present rainy season in the tropics, and recurrent viral
introductions and disease outbreaks, as occurred in RÃ©union in 2010, should be
expected. Chikungunya virus no longer simply threatens; it has arrived as a
significant, global pathogen.
