The haematology analyser Coulter GEN.S gives a set of data -'positional
parameters'- defining white blood cell (WBC) populations by mean of index values 
(mean and standard deviation of volume, conductivity and scatter, used to
identify the WBC populations). The volume and conductivity parameters related to 
the lymphocytes were analysed at diagnosis in patients suffering from chronic
B-lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), other non-CLL lymphoproliferative disorders
(OLPD) and viral diseases. The standard deviation of volume index (SDVI) is
significantly higher in the three groups, whereas the mean volume index (MVI) is 
significantly lower in B-CLL, and increased in OLPD and viral diseases. These two
groups could be distinguished by their mean conductivity index (MCI), which is
significantly lower in viral disease group. Cut-offs were calculated for each
parameter by the mean of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The
study of the detection performances showed that the combination of lymphocyte
count with SDVI, MVI and MCI could be used with a good sensitivity and
specificity to discriminate between the most frequent lymphocyte pathologies,
even in patients with normal lymphocyte count.
