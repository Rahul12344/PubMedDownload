TTV is a new virus which was identified in the serum of a patient with non-A-G
post-transfusion hepatitis in Japan. The original workers aimed to account for
the small number of post transfusion hepatitis cases found in their clinical
practice. Subsequent work has attempted to determine the properties and unravel
the natural history of the new agent. The original study applied representational
difference analysis to detect foreign DNA sequences which were present only
during the acute phase of illness. Subsequent studies have used PCR to study the 
agent in serum liver and faeces. This review summarises the published data from
clinical and epidemiological studies in different countries. The inclusion of the
virus in the parvovirus family seems premature because its size is unknown, its
reported density is too light and its sequence lacks the characteristic long
terminal repeats. The agent can be found in 1-40% of health blood donors in
different countries and also in faeces. TTV is ubiquitous but its taxonomic
identity and disease load remain to be determined.
