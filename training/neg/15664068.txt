A panel of 15 recombinant single chain antibodies (scFv) specific to grapevine
virus B (GVB) were recovered from a human combinatorial scFv antibody library
using the phage display technique against purified virus particles. Two selected 
scFv-encoding genes were expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli cells as
dimeric antibodies. Successful detection of GVB in tissues of herbaceous hosts
and grapevine was obtained in a direct binding assay using dimeric scFvs. This
reagent was also shown to substitute efficiently for a GVB polyclonal serum in
standard DAS-ELISA test used routinely for diagnosis.
