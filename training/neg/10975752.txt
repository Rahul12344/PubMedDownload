AIMS: This prospective randomized trial was carried out in order to determine
whether the long-term administration of ursodeoxycholic acid after
discontinuation of interferon had any beneficial effect on the clinical course of
hepatitis C virus infection.
METHODS: Enrolled in the study were 203 patients with chronic active hepatitis C.
They were all given: interferon alpha-2a (3 MU subcutaneously thrice a week) and 
ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg/day) for 9 months. At month 9, biochemical
responders only were randomized into ursodeoxycholic acid treatment or placebo
for 12 additional months (double blind study).
RESULTS: At the end of interferon therapy, 71 patients (37%) were virological
responders and 107 (56%) patients were biochemical responders and were
randomized: 54 into the ursodeoxycholic acid group and 53 into the placebo group.
Sustained response was evaluated 12 months after withdrawal of interferon.
Sustained biochemical and virological responses were, respectively, 30% and 22%
in the ursodeoxycholic acid group and 46% and 32% in the placebo group, which did
not significantly differ. Histological evolution of fibrosis and necrotic
inflammatory activity were similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Continuation of ursodeoxycholic acid therapy after withdrawal of
interferon in patients with end-of-treatment response did not result in any
significant improvement either in the maintenance of response to interferon or in
liver histology.
