Comment on
    Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2016 Mar 15;113(11):3048-53.

A recent study provides a platform for generating infectious coronavirus genomes 
using sequence data, examining their capabilities of replicating in human cells
and causing diseases in animal models, and evaluating therapeutics and vaccines. 
Similar approaches could be used to assess the potential of human emergence and
pathogenicity for other viruses.
