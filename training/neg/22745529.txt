Serially-sampled nucleotide sequences can be used to infer demographic history of
evolving viral populations. The shape of a phylogenetic tree often reflects the
interplay between evolutionary and ecological processes. Several approaches exist
to analyze the topology and traits of a phylogenetic tree, by means of tree
balance, branching patterns and comparative properties. The temporal clustering
(TC) statistic is a new topological measure, based on ancestral character
reconstruction, which characterizes the temporal structure of a phylogeny. Here, 
PhyloTempo is the first implementation of the TC in the R language, integrating
several other topological measures in a user-friendly graphical framework. The
comparison of the TC statistic with other measures provides multifaceted insights
on the dynamic processes shaping the evolution of pathogenic viruses. The
features and applicability of PhyloTempo were tested on serially-sampled
intra-host human and simian immunodeficiency virus population data sets.
