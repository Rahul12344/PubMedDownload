We describe 2 children with typical hand, foot, and mouth disease due to
enterovirus 71 infection, 1 of whom died. Both cases were complicated by acute
fulminant shock syndrome; the patients had remarkable acute left ventricular
dysfunction. The clinical experience indicates that the rapid death associated
with fulminant enterovirus rhombencephalitis is the result of rapid cardiogenic
shock rather than neurogenic pulmonary edema.
