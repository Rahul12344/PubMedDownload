GOAL: The goal of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of human
herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection among HIV-infected individuals from Brazil and
the associated risk factors.
STUDY: A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 497 HIV/AIDS outpatients
attending the local AIDS Reference Center in Santos (southeastern Brazil) between
February 1997 and January 1998 had serum samples screened for anti-HHV-8
antibodies. Patients were considered seropositive whenever reactivity was
observed in at least 1 of 3 tests (immunofluorescence assays for latent nuclear
and lytic antigens and orf65 recombinant antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay).
RESULTS: Overall HHV-8 seroprevalence was 13.9% (95% confidence interval [CI],
10.9-17.6). HHV-8 coinfection was significantly more frequent in men (18.7%; 95% 
CI, 14.1-23.4) than in women (7.8%; 95% CI, 4.2-11.3) (P < 0.001). According to
the mode of HIV acquisition among males, seroprevalence of HHV-8 infection was
significantly higher in men who have sex with men when compared with the other
groups (32.4% vs. 10.0%, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression revealed
HHV-8 infection among men to be independently associated with sexual orientation 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 5.5 for homosexuals; AOR, 2.8 for bisexuals). No
significant risk factor for HHV-8 infection could be demonstrated for
HIV-infected women in this cohort,
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further evidence that men who have sex with men 
are at higher risk of HHV-8 infection and shows that the epidemiologic pattern of
this infection among HIV/AIDS patients from Santos, Brazil, is similar to that
described in other countries with a low incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma.
