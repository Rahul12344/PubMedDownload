Hepatitis B virus markers among family contacts and medical personnel of 239
hemodialysis patients.

Gahl GM, Vogl E, Kraft D, Hess G, Arnold W.

The present study was initiated to assess the risk of infection of medical
personnel and family contacts of hemodialysis patients. It confirms previous
reports that hemodialysis patients and staff members of hemodialysis units are at
high risk of acquiring HBV infection. Approximately 25% of the household contacts
had serological signs of past or ongoing HBV infections. The risk of infection of
the family contact was independent of the mode of dialysis but increased if the
contact was a spouse, assisted in dialysis, or if the index hemodialysis patient 
was HBsAg positive. There is an urgent need for active immunization to prevent
spread of HBV related to hemodialysis.
