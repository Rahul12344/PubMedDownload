The considerable heterogeneity in the number and severity of symptoms observed in
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has been regarded as an obstacle to any future
research. Some authors believe that clinical heterogeneity results from the
complex interplay of the many genetic and environmental factors that themselves
define a condition as multifactorial. However, it is important to note that
neuropathological findings in both idiopathic and syndromic autism suggests a
single pathophysiological mechanism acting during brain development: the
heterochronic division of germinal cells and subsequent migrational abnormalities
of daughter cells to their target fields. Multiple exogenous (e.g., viruses,
drugs) and endogenous (e.g., genetic mutations) factors are known to disrupt the 
division of germinal cells and provide for an autism phenotype. The variety of
endogenous and exogenous factors, their timing of action during brain
development, and the genetic susceptibility of affected individuals (a Triple Hit
hypothesis) may all account for the clinical heterogeneity of ASD.
