OBJECTIVES: To investigate the molecular epidemiology and genetic structure of
HIV-1s causing the epidemic in Central Myanmar and to explore the genesis of HIV 
epidemic in this area.
DESIGN: A molecular epidemiological investigation was conducted in 1999-2000 in
the city of Mandalay among high-risk populations and the structural features of
circulating HIV-1s were analyzed.
METHODS: HIV-1 genotypes of 59 specimens were screened based on gag (p17) and env
(C2/V3) regions. Near full-length nucleotide sequences of HIV-1 isolates with
subtype discordance were determined and their recombinant structures were
characterized.
RESULTS: Three lineages of HIV-1 strains, including CRF01_AE (27, 45.8%), subtype
B' (Thailand variant of subtype B) (15, 25.4%) and subtype C (8, 13.6%), were
distributed in Mandalay, while substantial portions (9, 15.3%) of specimens
showed various patterns of subtype discordance in different regions of HIV-1
genomes. The study on six HIV-1 isolates with subtype discordance revealed that
they were highly diverse types of unique recombinant forms (URFs) comprised of
various combinations of three circulating subtypes. One URF was a particularly
complex mosaic that contained 13 recombination breakpoints between three HIV-1
subtypes. Approximately half of recombinants showed 'pseudotype' virion
structures, in which the external portions of envelope glycoproteins were
exchanged with different lineages of HIV-1 strains, suggesting the potential
selective advantage of 'pseudotype' viruses over parental strains.
CONCLUSION: The study revealed the unique geographical hot spot in Central
Myanmar where extensive recombination events appeared to be taking place
continually. This reflects the presence of highly exposed individuals and social 
networks of HIV-1 transmission.
