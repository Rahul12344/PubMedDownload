Oncolytic virotherapy has demonstrated multimodal antitumor mechanisms in both
preclinical and clinical settings for cancer treatment, including antitumor
immunity. Compared with conventional immunotherapy, oncolytic viruses have the
advantages of simultaneous cytoreduction and conferring personalized anticancer
immunity, but without the need of personalized manufacture. Additionally,
oncolytic viruses can be further engineered to delete immunosuppressive viral
components and to insert transgenes that enhance antitumor immunity. Finally,
combination with new immunomodulating agents (e.g., cyclophosphamide) or cell
therapy approaches will likely further augment specific antitumor immunity of
virotherapy. Virotherapy could become a new paradigm for potent, safe and
practical therapeutic vaccines for cancer.
