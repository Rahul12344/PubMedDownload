Expression of early adenovirus genes requires a viral encoded acidic polypeptide.

Ricciardi RP, Jones RL, Cepko CL, Sharp PA, Roberts BE.

Host-range mutants of adenovirus 5 that contain a defect in region E1A (0-4.5
units) fail to replicate in HeLa cells and to transform rodent cells. In HeLa
cells, these mutants synthesize only the two RNAs from E1A that share the same 5'
and 3' termini but differ in length by the amount of internal sequence removed by
splicing. RNA from wild-type virus, selected by hybridization to DNA from region 
E1A, translates into polypeptides of Mr 51,000 and 48,000 that are highly acidic 
in isoelectric focusing gels. These acidic Mr 51,000 and Mr 48,000 polypeptides
are encoded by the longer and shorter E1A RNAs, respectively. Two of the
host-range mutants, H5hr1 and H5hr2, fail to synthesize the Mr 51,000 polypeptide
but do produce the Mr 48,000 polypeptide and a novel polypeptide thought to be a 
truncated portion of the Mr 51,000 polypeptide. H5hr1 and H5hr2 are hypothesized 
to have termination codons in sequences found only in RNA encoding the Mr 51,000 
polypeptide. This prediction is verified for H5hr1 by DNA sequence analysis. The 
other three host-range mutants (H5hr3-5) synthesize both acidic polypeptides and 
are predicted to be missense. These results strongly imply that the Mr 51,000
polypeptide, alone or in combination with the Mr 48,000 polypeptide, is needed to
regulate expression of adjacent viral genes during the early phase of adenovirus 
infection.
