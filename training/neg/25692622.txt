There is growing public concern regarding assay sensitivity to HBsAg mutants in
clinical diagnosis and vaccine escape. The aim of this study is to introduce a
new HBsAg mutant strain. The serum samples were those of patient X at the age of 
3 months and 3Â years respectively, and of her mother immediately before
parturition, which were used to amplify the HBsAg-coding DNA fragments by PCR.
The HBsAg DNA sequences were translated into their corresponding amino acid
sequences and then aligned in pubmed with nucleotide blast. The sequencing data
of S coding regions shows that patient X has been infected by a new HBV variant
with an A to C substitution at nt431, resulting in an Asp(GAC)to Ala(GCC)
substitution at aa144 of major protein; CC to AA substitution at nt359 and nt360,
resulting in an Pro(CCC) to Gln(CAA) substitution at aa120 of pre "a" epitope; A 
to G substitution at nt491, resulting in an Glu(GAG) to Gly(GGG) substitution at 
aa164 of post "a" epitope. Three new mutations (S171F, S174N and Q181R) at the
antigenic epitopes of HBV presented by HLA class I molecules are found. The HBV
mutant strain causes vaccine escape and occult infection.
