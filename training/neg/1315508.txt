Ninety throat swabs from 30 healthy children who received varicella vaccine were 
tested for varicella zoster virus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction.
Seroconversion was observed in 27 of 30 (90%) vaccinees. The positive rates were 
7.4% (2/27) at one week and 0% (0/27) at four weeks after vaccination. These
rates were considerably lower than those in normal children with varicella.
