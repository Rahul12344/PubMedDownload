Highly purified chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) is shown to stimulate RNA
synthesis directly in an in vitro transcription assay. Stimulation of
transcription by cPR requires the presence of progesterone response elements
(PREs) in the template and can be specifically inhibited by addition of
competitor oligonucleotides containing PREs. Binding of receptor to two PREs is
cooperative and leads to synergistic (27-fold) stimulation of transcription. A
purified fusion protein containing the DNA binding domain of cPR linked to yeast 
ubiquitin was produced in E. coli and also functions in the transcription assay. 
Using this in vitro transcription system, we demonstrate that hormone-free cPR
activated by salt treatment induces transcription of a test gene in a
hormone-independent manner. Finally, we present evidence that the progesterone
receptor acts by facilitating the formation of a stable preinitiation complex at 
the target gene promoter and thus augments the initiation of transcription by RNA
polymerase II.
