Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have increased risk of
cardiovascular disease. Although evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis in
perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) is available, myocardial infarction has not been 
described in this population. We report a case of myocardial infarction in a
patient with PHIV with a brief literature review.
