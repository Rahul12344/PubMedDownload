The aim of the study was to describe the HIV care continuum in emergency
department (ED) patients in the Eastern Cape region of South Africa. This is a
cross-sectional, identity-unlinked serosurvey, whereby discarded/excess samples
from all patients who had blood drawn during the study period for routine care
and sufficient serum remaining were tested for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and
hepatitis C virus infection; HIV viral load (VL); and presence of antiretroviral 
(ARV) drugs. We also estimated cross-sectional incidence using the
Limiting-Antigen Avidity assay and HIV VL. The study was conducted between
September and November 2016 at the Frere Hospital Emergency Department in East
London, South Africa. The overall HIV prevalence in our study population was
26.9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 25.0-28.8; n = 2,100]. The highest
prevalence was observed among females in the 30-39 years age group [60.3% (95%
CI: 53.2-67.1)]. HIV prevalence was significantly higher among females compared
with males in both the 20-29 years age group and 30-39 years age group (p < .05),
but nearly identical to older age groups. ARV drugs were detected in 53.5% (95%
CI: 48.1-58.9) of HIV-infected subjects. The frequency of HIV viral suppression
(< 1,000 copies/mL) was 48.5% (95% CI: 44.3-52.7), and was not statistically
different between males and females (age-adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.15, 95%
CI: 0.95-1.39). The HIV incidence rate was estimated to be 2.6% (95% CI:
1.2-3.9). The Frere Hospital ED has an extremely high burden of HIV infection.
The detection of ARV drugs and prevalence of viral suppression fall short of the 
World Health Organization 90-90-90 goals in this population. Furthermore, there
were a large number of patients with recent infection in the ED. The ED is a
critical venue for testing and linkage to care of high-yield population who are
likely missed by current testing and linkage-to-care programs.
