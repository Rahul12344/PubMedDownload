Cancer: the eighth plague--a suggestion of pathogenesis.

Bluming AZ.

The current treatment of cancer is based on the assumption that this disease is
the result of autonomous clonal proliferation of aberrant cells which must be
excised, irradiated or selectively poisoned to achieve a cure. The presumption
that the malignant cell constitutes the disease is now challenged by a variety of
clinical observations and experimental studies. Like the grasshopper, which is
transformed into a locust under altered environmental conditions, the cancer cell
may be the manifestation of a defect in homeostatic regulation of cellular
proliferation. Identification of the specific regulatory defect could allow for a
more rational and more effective treatment of cancer in man.
