Lymphocytes provide gammaherpesviruses with a self-renewing substrate for
persistent infection and with transport to mucosal sites for host exit. Their
role in the initial colonization of new hosts is less clear. Murid herpesvirus 4 
(MuHV-4), an experimentally accessible, B-cell-tropic rhadinovirus (gamma-2
herpesvirus), persistently infects both immunocompetent and B-cell-deficient
mice. A lack of B-cells did not compromise MuHV-4 entry into lymphoid tissue,
which involved myeloid cell infection. However, it impaired infection
amplification and MuHV-4 exit from lymphoid tissue, which involved myeloid to
B-cell transfer.
