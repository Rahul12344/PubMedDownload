Membrane fusion is essential in several cellular processes in the existence of
eukaryotic cells such as cellular trafficking, compartmentalization,
intercellular communication, sexual reproduction, cell division, and endo- and
exocytosis. Membrane fusion proceeds in model membranes as well as biological
membranes through the rearrangement of lipids. The stalk hypothesis provides a
picture of the general nature of lipid rearrangement based on mechanical
properties and phase behavior of water-lipid mesomorphic systems. In spite of
extensive research on exploring the mechanism of membrane fusion, a clear
molecular understanding of intermediate and pore formation is lacking. In
addition, the mechanism by which proteins and peptides reduce the activation
energy for stalk and pore formation is not yet clear though there are several
propositions on how they catalyze membrane fusion. In this review, we have
discussed about various putative functions of fusion peptides by which they
reduce activation barrier and thus promote membrane fusion. A careful analysis of
the discussed effects of fusion peptides on membranes might open up new
possibilities for better understanding of the membrane fusion mechanism.
