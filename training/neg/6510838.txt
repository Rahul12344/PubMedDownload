Occurrence of ixodid ticks--the main vectors of tick-borne encephalitis virus in 
urbanized territory.

Korenberg E, Cern√Ω V, Daniel M.

The influence of urbanization on ticks I. ricinus and I. persulcatus--the main
vectors of tick-borne encephalitis virus is discussed on the basis of concrete
examples. It has been revealed that under favourable conditions the populations
of these tick species can exist for a long time not only in towns and new housing
estates, but in the old residential districts as well. The necessity of studying 
the ecology of urban populations of ixodid ticks is pointed out.
