Ten human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients were given rifabutin in
addition to fluconazole and clarithromycin. There was a 76% increase in the area 
under the concentration-time curve of rifabutin when either fluconazole or
clarithromycin was given alone and a 152% increase when both drugs were given
together with rifabutin. Patients should be monitored for adverse effects of
rifabutin administered concomitantly with clarithromycin and/or fluconazole.
