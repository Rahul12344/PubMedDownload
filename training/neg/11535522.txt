It is thought that human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) preferentially
infects CD4(+) T cells in vivo. However, observations of high HTLV-I proviral
load in patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis
suggest that HTLV-I may infect other cell types in addition to CD4(+) T cells. To
identify in vivo T-cell tropisms of HTLV-I, real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) and intracellular protein staining were used. A high amount 
of HTLV-I proviral DNA was detected from purified CD8(+) T cells by quantitative 
PCR (between 1.64 and 62.83 copies of HTLV-I provirus per 100 isolated CD8(+) T
cells). CD8(+) T cells expressed HTLV-I-related antigens (HTLV-I Tax and p19
protein) after a short time in cultivation. These results demonstrate that CD8(+)
T cells are also infected with HTLV-I and express HTLV-I antigens at levels that 
are comparable to HTLV-I-infected CD4(+) cells. Therefore, CD8(+) cells are an
additional viral reservoir in vivo for HTLV-I and may contribute to the
pathogenesis of HTLV-I-mediated disorders.
