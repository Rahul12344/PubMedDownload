The genomic, biological, and serological characterization of tomato necrotic spot
virus (ToNSV), a virus first described infecting tomato in California, was
completed. The complete genomic sequence identified ToNSV as a new subgroup 1
ilarvirus distinct from the previously described tomato-infecting ilarviruses. We
identified ToNSV in Indiana in 2017 and 2018 and in Ohio in 2018. The coat
protein coding region of the isolates from California, Indiana, and Ohio have 94 
to 98% identity, while the same isolates had 99% amino acid identity. ToNSV is
serologically related to TSV, a subgroup 1 ilarvirus, and shows no serological
relationship to ilarviruses in the other subgroups. In tomato, ToNSV caused
symptoms of necrotic spots and flecks on leaves, necrotic streaking on stems, and
necrotic spots and circular patterns on fruit resulting in a yield loss of 1 to
13%. These results indicate that ToNSV is a proposed new subgroup 1 ilarvirus
causing a necrotic spotting disease of tomato observed in California, Indiana,
and Ohio.
