An indirect sandwich ELISA that can detect as little as 8 ng of African
horsesickness virus (AHSV) was developed. Viral antigen was captured from
suspension using an immobilized monoclonal antibody specific for an epitope on
VP7, a protein that is a major constituent of the virus core. Egg-yolk derived
chicken IgY directed against AHSV (serotype 3) was used as the secondary
antibody. Since IgY and mouse IgG do not cross-react serologically, the secondary
antibody was not labelled, but was instead detected with enzyme-coupled sheep
antibodies directed against avian immunoglobulins. The assay recognized all nine 
AHSV serotypes, but not the Cascara isolate of equine encephalosis virus, a
related orbivirus that also infects horses. In addition to being able to detect
and quantify whole AHSV, the ELISA could show the presence of VP7 produced by
recombinant baculoviruses.
