Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core is a viral structural protein; it also participates 
in some cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation. However, the
mechanisms of core-mediated transcriptional regulation remain poorly understood. 
Oncogenic virus proteins often target p300/CBP, a known co-activator of a wide
variety of transcription factors, to regulate the expression of cellular and
viral genes. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that HCV core protein
interacts with p300/CBP and enhances both its acetyl-transferase and
transcriptional activities. In addition, we demonstrate that nuclear core protein
activates the NH2-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) of NF-AT1 in a
p300/CBP-dependent manner. We propose a model in which core protein regulates the
co-activation function of p300/CBP and activates NF-AT1, and probably other
p300/CBP-regulated transcription factors, by a novel mechanism involving the
regulation of the acetylation state of histones and/or components of the
transcriptional machinery.
