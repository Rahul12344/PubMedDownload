Lassa fever afflicts tens of thousands of people in West Africa annually. The
rapid progression of patients from febrile illness to fulminant syndrome and
death provides incentive for development of clinical prognostic markers that can 
guide case management. The small molecule profile of serum from febrile patients 
triaged to the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Ward at Kenema Government Hospital in
Sierra Leone was assessed using untargeted Ultra High Performance Liquid
Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Physiological dysregulation resulting from
Lassa virus (LASV) infection occurs at the small molecule level. Effects of LASV 
infection on pathways mediating blood coagulation, and lipid, amino acid, nucleic
acid metabolism are manifest in changes in the levels of numerous metabolites in 
the circulation. Several compounds, including platelet activating factor (PAF),
PAF-like molecules and products of heme breakdown emerged as candidates that may 
prove useful in diagnostic assays to inform better care of Lassa fever patients.
