Size estimation of Pichinde virus RNA by gel electrophoresis under denaturing
conditions.

Ramsingh AI, Dimock K, Rawls WE, Leung WC.

RNA extracted from purified Pichinde virion preparations yields four major
species, two of which appear to represent the viral genome while the other two
appear to be cellular ribosomal 28S and 18S RNA. The molecular weights of these
RNA species have been estimated by gel electrophoresis following denaturation by 
either methylmercury or glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide. The values determined by the 
two methods are in close agreement. The average molecular weights of L and S
Pichinde viral RNA are 2.63 x 10(6) to 2.83 x 10(6) to 1.31 x 10(6),
respectively.
