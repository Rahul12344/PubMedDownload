Techniques for analyzing DNA distributions on agarose gels are examined by both
two-dimensional and one-dimensional methods. It is demonstrated that very large
errors in DNA concentration occur in such analyses unless (i) the electrophoresis
is performed in a careful, reproducible manner, (ii) the films are calibrated
with an internal standard, (iii) high resolution densitometry is used for
analyzing the films, and (iv) appropriate background controls are used to
determine the baselines for integration. Two-dimensional scanning produces more
accurate results than one-dimensional scanning, but in cases where the bands are 
relatively uniform, the one-dimensional analysis gives good results. A technique 
for determining accurate distributions is described.
