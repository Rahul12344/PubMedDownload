PURPOSE: Universal screening for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) before
chemotherapy has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control. We sought
to determine the practice of Australian oncologists with regard to HBV screening 
in patients with solid tumors (STs) and their clinical experience of HBV
reactivation (HBVR).
METHODS: A survey was sent to all consultant members of the Medical Oncology
Group of Australia. One hundred eighty-eight responses (63% response rate) were
received. We also reviewed the incidence of HBV in patients with STs screened at 
the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia).
RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of medical oncologists screen for HBV, but only 19% 
screen all patients. The most common reasons given for performing screening were 
anecdotal experience of HBVR (46%) and perceived sufficient evidence for
screening of some patient subgroups (42%). Sixty-five percent of those who
screened did so only in subgroups, usually selecting patients on the basis of
ethnicity (82%). Oncologists who did not screen most commonly cited inadequate
evidence for a benefit of screening (72%). Twenty-two percent of oncologists had 
witnessed one or more HBVR events, representing one event per 45 years of
respondents' practice. HBVR events reported (n = 54) consisted of asymptomatic
liver test abnormalities only (44%), symptomatic hepatitis (28%), decompensated
liver failure (19%), and death (7%). In 206 patients with STs screened for HBV,
1.0% (n = 2) were HBV surface antigen positive, and 14.9% hepatitis B core
antibody positive.
CONCLUSION: The majority of Australian medical oncologists have not adopted
universal HBV screening before chemotherapy. Further evidence of the benefit and 
cost effectiveness of universal screening in patients with STs will be required
to alter practice.
