CD8+ T cells play an important role in immunity to viruses. Just how important
these cells are is demonstrated by the evolution of viral strategies for blocking
the generation or display of peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I
complexes on the surfaces of virus-infected cells. Here, we focus on viral
interference with antigen presentation; in particular we consider the importance 
(and difficulty) of establishing the evolutionary significance (that is, the
ability to enhance viral transmission) of viral gene products that interfere with
antigen presentation in vitro.
