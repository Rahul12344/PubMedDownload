Effects of environmental variables and soil characteristics on virus survival in 
soil.

Hurst CJ, Gerba CP, Cech I.

Because of the increasing emphasis placed upon land application as a means of
wastewater disposal, it is important to evaluate the influences of different
factors upon virus survival in soil. The objective of this study was to measure
the effects of various environmental variables on virus persistence. Test samples
of soil were placed in vials, and the soil was wetted with suspensions of virus
in either distilled water, unchlorinated secondary sewage effluent, or mixtures
of effluent and water. The viruses used were coxsackieviruses A9 and B3,
echovirus 1, poliovirus 2, rotavirus SA11, and bacteriophages T2 and MS2. The
rate of virus inactivation was evaluated statistically with regard to conditions 
under which the vials were incubated and to the soil characteristics. The factors
that were found to influence virus survival were temperature, soil moisture
content, presence of aerobic microorganisms, degree of virus adsorption to the
soil, soil levels of resin-extractable phosphorus, exchangeable aluminium, and
soil pH. Overall, temperature and virus adsorption to soil appeared to be the
most important factors affecting virus survival.
