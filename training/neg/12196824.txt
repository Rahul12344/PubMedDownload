BACKGROUND: To investigate expression of IL-6 in non?replicating vaccinia virus
and its immune effects on recombinant virus.
METHODS: The recombinant non replicating vaccinia virus RVJ123 delta CK11 beta
75IL6 was constructed with non?replicating vaccinia virus vector
pNEOCK11beta75IL6 and replicating vaccinia virus RVJ123. In animal model,
immunization with the recombinant virus was carried out and its immune response
was studied.
RESULTS: The recombinant virus could express IL-nd HBsAg simultaneously. Southern
blot analysis demonstrated that the genes between vaccinia virus Hind? C and K
fragments were deleted and IL-6 gene was integrated stably. Given intranasal
inocula of the virus to immunize BALB/c mouse and New Zealand Rabbit, the
elevated anti-HBsAg IgA and IgG antibody secreting cells in mouse lung lymphoid
to vectors expressing IL-6 was at about two?fold higher level than those elicited
by control virus at day 14 after immunization. Authors also could detect elevated
anti-HBsAg IgA and IgG antibody conversion in mouse serum and lung fluid, rabbits
serum, lung fluid, saliva, vagina and nasal washing samples.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 expressed by non-replicating recombinant vaccinia virus could
enhance the induced?immune effects, it could serve as the effective adjuvant for 
recombinant vector vaccine.
