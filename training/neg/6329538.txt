RNA electropherotypes of human rotaviruses from North and South America.

Dimitrov DH, Graham DY, Lopez J, Muchinik G, Velasco G, Stenback WA, Estes MK.

Between April 1979 and December 1982, viral agents were found in 231 of 695
children admitted to the Texas Children's Hospital with gastroenteritis. Electron
microscopic analysis showed that rotaviruses were the most common viral agents,
and a seasonal pattern of rotavirus disease was observed. The migration patterns 
of the RNA segments of these rotaviruses on electrophoresis in polyacrylamide
gels were compared with those of rotaviruses collected from other areas of the
United States of America and from Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. A number of
different RNA electropherotypes were found, including some patterns not
previously reported.
