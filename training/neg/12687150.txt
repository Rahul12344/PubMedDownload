Immunological interrelations are one of the most important factors, forming all
the periods of ontogenetic body development. At early ontogenesis in the organism
of mammals, including humans, the immunological tolerance is induced to own
(self) antigens that prevents the development of autoimmune reactions in adult
life. The system of immune recognition reaches its fine discriminative capacity
in mammals and humans on the background of recognition of self HLA class I (CTL
of CD8(+) phenotype) or class II (T helpers of CD4(+) phenotype). The phenomenon 
of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction reactivity of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) makes difficult the recognition in changes or mutations in HLA 
system. Natural killers (NK) control constantly the structure of self MHC class I
molecules, and in contrast to CTL may recognize small antigenic changes of MHC
molecules, induced by viruses, mutations and transformation. Immune system aging 
is displayed by both quantitative, and functional changes in lymphocyte
subpopulations with prevalence of T helpers type 2 over type 1 cells, responsible
for the development of DTH. According to immunological theory of aging, the role 
of immune system cells should be taken into consideration in relation to the
synthesis of activated oxygen forms with bactericidal properties by monocytes and
neutrophils. Overproduction of activated oxygen radicals may result in
destruction of proteins, lipids, DNA, and in the body aging. Activated oxygen
radicals are one of events of lymphocyte apoptosis in aerobic conditions.
