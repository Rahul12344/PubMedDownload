The replication enzyme of RNA viruses must preferentially recognize their RNAs in
an environment that contains an abundance of cellular RNAs. The factors
responsible for specific RNA recognition are not well understood, in part because
viral RNA synthesis takes place within enzyme complexes associated with modified 
cellular membrane compartments. Recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps)
from the human norovirus and the murine norovirus (MNV) were found to
preferentially recognize RNA segments that contain the promoter and a short
template sequence for subgenomic RNA synthesis. Both the promoter and template
sequence contribute to stable RdRp binding, accurate initiation of the subgenomic
RNAs and efficient RNA synthesis. Using a method that combines RNA crosslinking
and mass spectrometry, residues near the template channel of the MNV RdRp were
found to contact the hairpin RNA motif. Mutations in the hairpin contact site in 
the MNV RdRp reduced MNV replication and virus production in cells. This work
demonstrates that the specific recognition of the norovirus subgenomic promoter
is through binding by the viral RdRp.
