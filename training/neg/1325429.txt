The core sequence of the enhancer of murine leukemia virus (MuLV) long terminal
repeat is highly conserved in a large number of MuLV strains and appears to play 
an essential role when SL3-3 or Moloney strains induce T cell lymphoma in mice.
We found by using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay that a polyomavirus
enhancer core-binding protein, PEBP2, bound to this core motif of MuLV. We also
noted that PEBP2 in several hematopoietic cell lines derived from B lymphocyte,
macrophage and myelocyte lineages migrated significantly faster than the
authentic PEBP2 detected in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Interestingly, PEBP2 detected in 
the cell lines of T lymphocyte lineage appeared to contain both types, which were
indistinguishable in electrophoretic mobility from those of NIH3T3 and of B
lymphocyte, macrophage and myelocyte lineages. The treatment of the nuclear
extract containing PEBP2 with phosphatase generated PEBP3, which is a
subcomponent of PEBP2 and retained the same DNA-binding specificity as PEBP2. The
altered mobility of hematopoietic cell-derived or T lymphocyte-derived PEBP2 was 
found to be due to the alteration of the mobility of PEBP3. Based on the distinct
mobility of PEBP2/3 of T lymphocytes from those of other hematopoietic cells, we 
discuss the implication of PEBP2 in MuLV-induced T cell leukemia and T
cell-specific gene expression.
