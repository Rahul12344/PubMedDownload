Coherent diffractive imaging using x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) may provide
a unique opportunity for high-resolution structural analysis of single particles 
sprayed from an aqueous solution into the laser beam. As a result, diffraction
images are measured from randomly oriented objects covered by a water layer. We
analyze theoretically how the thickness of the covering water layer influences
the structural and orientational information contained in the recorded
diffraction images. This study has implications for planned experiments on
single-particle imaging with XFELs.
