In this paper mechanically permeabilized cells have been used to dissect the
transport of Semliki Forest virus glycoproteins from the trans-Golgi network to
the plasma membrane. Transport from the Golgi complex was monitored by measuring 
the proteolytic cleavage of the Semliki Forest virus p62 glycoprotein into the E2
and E3 polypeptide chains. Cell surface appearance was measured by the exposure
of the exoplasmic domain to antibodies directed against the viral glycoprotein.
Both the cleavage of the p62 protein and the transport of the glycoprotein to the
cell surface were reconstituted in permeabilized BHK cells when calcium and
glucose were present in the medium. Detailed analysis showed that the cleavage of
the p62 protein occurred before arrival to the plasma membrane.
