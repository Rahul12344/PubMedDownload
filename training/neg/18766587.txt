Sera from chickens, turkeys and ducks were examined for antibody to avian
nephritis virus, by indirect immunofluorescence. Antibody was found to be
widespread in commercial fowls and turkeys and was also detected in sera from
specific pathogen-free chickens. No antibody was detected in a limited number of 
duck sera tested. The possibility of contamination of avian vaccines with avian
nephritis virus is discussed.
