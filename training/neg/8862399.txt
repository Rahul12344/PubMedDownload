Human MxA protein is a type I Interferon-inducible intracytoplasmic protein,
which mediates antiviral actions against a variety of negative-strand RNA viruses
including influenza A, measles, and vesicular stomatitis viruses. Recently, it
has also been shown that several members of the Bunyaviridae family are inhibited
by MxA protein. The hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family includes
important human pathogenic viruses, e.g., Puumala (PUUV), Hantaan, and Sin Nombre
viruses. Tula virus (TULV) is a new member of the genus, but its pathogenicity in
man remains to be determined. As assumed by the similarities in replication
strategy. MxA would be a good candidate molecule for antiviral action against
these viruses, also. To gain more insight into the MxA action on PUUV, we studied
PUUV and TULV replication in stably MxA genetransfected Vero cells. We show that 
MxA protein has the capacity to inhibit both viral protein and RNA accumulation
in virus-infected cells. We also studied PUUV and TULV infection in
MxA-transfected U-937 cell clones. In these cell lines both hantaviruses grew
poorly, independent of whether the cells were expressing MxA or not Whether cell 
line-specific differences in the antiviral activity of MxA protein against
hantaviruses exist cannot be conclusively determined due to the lack of
productive infection of PUUV and TULV in U-937 cells.
