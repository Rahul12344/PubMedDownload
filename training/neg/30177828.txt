Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently emerged as a global health concern owing to its
widespread diffusion and its association with severe neurological symptoms and
microcephaly in newborns1. However, the molecular mechanisms that are responsible
for the pathogenicity of ZIKV remain largely unknown. Here we use human neural
progenitor cells and the neuronal cell line SK-N-BE2 in an integrated proteomics 
approach to characterize the cellular responses to viral infection at the
proteome and phosphoproteome level, and use affinity proteomics to identify
cellular targets of ZIKV proteins. Using this approach, we identify 386
ZIKV-interacting proteins, ZIKV-specific and pan-flaviviral activities as well as
host factors with known functions in neuronal development, retinal defects and
infertility. Moreover, our analysis identified 1,216 phosphorylation sites that
are specifically up- or downregulated after ZIKV infection, indicating profound
modulation of fundamental signalling pathways such as AKT, MAPK-ERK and ATM-ATR
and thereby providing mechanistic insights into the proliferation arrest elicited
by ZIKV infection. Functionally, our integrative study identifies ZIKV
host-dependency factors and provides a comprehensive framework for a system-level
understanding of ZIKV-induced perturbations at the levels of proteins and
cellular pathways.
