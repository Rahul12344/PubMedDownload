Nuclear receptors represent key regulators in cell proliferation,
differentiation, and development. Here we demonstrate that the nuclear orphan
receptor TR4 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and tissues and have
analyzed the impact of TR4 in this cell compartment. We show that TR4, when
ectopically expressed in bone marrow cells via retrovirus vector, promotes
proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. Cells represent promyelocytes as
judged by morphological features, expression of cell surface molecules, and
specific markers like Mim-1 and CAAT/enhancer binding protein beta. We also
demonstrate that the growth promoting activity of TR4 is not exclusively
dependent on its association with DNA, because expression of a mutated TR4
version devoid of its DNA binding domain exhibits a similar proliferative
potential as wild-type TR4. In conclusion, these data position the orphan
receptor TR4 as an important regulator of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation
and development.
