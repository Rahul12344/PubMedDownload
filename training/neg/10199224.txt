OBJECTIVES: To use follow-up on untreated HIV-positive men to assess the
prognostic information provided by baseline data on plasma HIV RNA, CD4 cell
count, age, and HIV-related symptom status, separately for three specific
AIDS-defining illnesses: Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), cytomegalovirus
(CMV), and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).
METHODS: The study population were 734 HIV-positive homosexual men enrolled in
the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, with follow-up (1984-1985 through mid-1988)
restricted to the antiretroviral treatment-free and prophylaxis-free era.
Baseline marker values were categorized and assessed as predictor variables in
separate time-to-event analyses for each of the three specific outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 138 cases of PCP, 25 cases of CMV, and 25 cases of MAC were
observed. For PCP and CMV, higher categories of HIV RNA and lower categories of
CD4 cell count were associated with increased risk relative to the respective
reference groups. For MAC, oral candidiasis or fever and elevated HIV RNA at
baseline were the primary risk factors. Further analysis highlighted the
importance of monitoring HIV RNA levels in addition to CD4 cell counts when
evaluating patients' risk of developing PCP.
CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of treatment, plasma HIV RNA levels provide
prognostic information about the risk of these three specific AIDS-defining
illnesses, independently of the CD4 cell count. These data provide a useful
reference as researchers investigate changing patterns in the incidence and
predictors of opportunistic infections in the era of increasingly active
antiretroviral therapies.
