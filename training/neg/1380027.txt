We determined serum hepatitis C status using a RIBA2 kit and a sensitive PCR
procedure in 62 chronic alcoholics, 36 of whom had anti-HCV antibodies (Ab)
detectable in an ELISA1 assay. Anti-HCV antibodies were detected in 22 patients
using RIBA2. HCV RNA was detected by means of PCR in 18 patients who were RIBA2
positive and in none who were RIBA2 negative. Liver biopsies, available for 12
HCV RNA-positive patients, revealed histological features of purely
alcohol-related lesions in seven and mixed alcohol-viral lesions in five. These
results indicate that HCV replication is maintained in most alcoholics who score 
positive for anti-HCV Ab in the RIBA2 test, and that HCV viremia can be
associated with histological features typical of alcoholic liver disease.
