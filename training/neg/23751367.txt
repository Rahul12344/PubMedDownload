Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a severe hemorrhagic fever with case fatality rates of 
up to 90%, for which no antiviral therapies are available. Antiviral screening is
hampered by the fact that development of cytopathic effect, the easiest means to 
detect infection with wild-type EBOV, is relatively slow. To overcome this
problem we generated a recombinant EBOV carrying a luciferase reporter. Using
this virus we show that EBOV entry is rapid, with viral protein expression
detectable within 2 h after infection. Further, luminescence-based assays were
developed to allow highly sensitive titer determination within 48 h. As a
proof-of-concept for its utility in antiviral screening we used this virus to
assess neutralizing antibodies and siRNAs, with significantly faster screening
times than currently available wild-type or recombinant viruses. The availability
of this recombinant virus will allow for more rapid and quantitative evaluation
of antivirals against EBOV, as well as the study of details of the EBOV life
cycle.
