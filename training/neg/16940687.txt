The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has resulted in an increase in
the prevalence of many opportunistic infections and has caused re-emergence of
certain diseases in the developing world. In tropical countries, immunosupression
due to HIV infection has resulted in changes in the clinical presentation of
endemic infections. Although the immune deficiency caused by HIV infection should
presumably lead to an increased frequency of clinical malaria in areas with
endemic malarial infection, like India, evidence of the association between HIV
and malaria in India is scanty, with only a few studies showing a positive
correlation. We hereby report a case of concurrent infection with Plasmodium
falciparum malaria and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in a young
male patient.
