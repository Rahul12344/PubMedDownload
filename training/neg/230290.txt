The isolation of Mengo virus stable non-capsid polypeptides from infected L cells
and preliminary characterization of an RNA polymerase activity associated with
polypeptide E.

Lund GA, Scraba DG.

Isolation of the Mengo virus stable non-capsid virus polypeptides E, F, G and I
from infected L cells has been achieved. Unstable precursors were eliminated by
incubation in the presence of pactamycin and capsid polypeptides were removed by 
ultracentrifugation and affinity chromatography. Subsequent sodium dodecyl
sulphate (SDS)-hydroxylapatite chromatography resolved the non-capsid proteins
into two major peaks which comprised F plus G and E plus I, respectively. The
individual polypeptide species were separated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100
in the presence of SDS. Polypeptide E was isolated in an undenatured form by gel 
filtration of infected cell extracts (from which precursor and capsid
polypeptides had been removed) on Bio-Gel A-5m agarose beads. Purified
polypeptide E was found to co-sediment with Mengo virion RNA during
centrifugation in a sucrose density gradient and it was also capable of binding
to poly(A)-Sepharose. Assay mixtures containing polypeptide E exhibited an RNA
polymerase activity which was dependent upon exogenous virus RNA template and
oligo(U) primer and which was not affected by the addition of virus capsid
polypeptides or extracts from uninfected cells.
