Avian influenza viruses represent a growing threat for an influenza pandemic. The
currently licensed influenza vaccines have inherent drawbacks which has led many 
research groups to explore different approaches of vaccine development among
which Virus Like particles (VLPs) seem like a promising alternative in the near
future. Although it is known that the Matrix 1 protein (M1) of influenza plays an
essential role in VLP formation and it is documented that M1 is able to form
dimers, it is not clear if M1 is capable of forming higher order structures
without the interference of other influenza proteins or cell derived envelope.
Here, for the first time we have demonstrated that expression of M1 alone is
enough to form a Capsid Like Particle (CLP) without the requirement of any other 
external factor.
