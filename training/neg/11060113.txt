Nasal turbinates or swabs were collected from wild ducks, geese, owls, sparrows, 
swallows, and starlings and from sentinel ducks placed next to turkey farms
experiencing avian pneumovirus (APV) infections and were analyzed for APV genome 
and infectious particles. APV RNA was detected in samples examined from geese,
sparrows, and starlings. APV RNA and antibodies were also detected in two
different groups of sentinel ducks. Infectious APV was recovered from sentinel
duck samples. The APV M gene isolated from the wild birds had over 96% predicted 
amino acid identity with APV/Minnesota 2A, which was isolated earlier from
domestic turkeys showing respiratory illness, suggesting that wild birds may be
involved in spreading APV infection.
