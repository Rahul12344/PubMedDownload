The CD300a inhibitory receptor belongs to the CD300 family of cell surface
molecules that regulate a diverse array of immune cell processes. The inhibitory 
signal of CD300a depends on the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues embedded in 
ITIMs of the cytoplasmic tail. CD300a is broadly expressed on myeloid and
lymphoid cells, and its expression is differentially regulated depending on the
cell type. The finding that CD300a recognizes phosphatidylserine and
phosphatidylethanolamine, two aminophospholipids exposed on the outer leaflet of 
dead and activated cells, has shed new light on its role in the modulation of
immune functions and in its participation in the host response to several
diseases states, such as infectious diseases, cancer, allergy, and chronic
inflammatory diseases. This review summarizes the literature on CD300a
expression, regulation, signaling pathways, and ligand interaction, as well as
its role in fine tuning immune cell functions and its clinical relevance.
