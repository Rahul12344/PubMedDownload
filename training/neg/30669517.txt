Although Hepatitis E is increasingly described as a major cause of liver disease 
in industrialized countries, the epidemiology is far from being fully elucidated.
We provide here a comprehensive review of documented clusters of cases, and of
serological studies conducted in populations with distinct types of exposure.
Seroprevalence rates range from <5% to >50% depending on the countries and the
groups of population. Such discrepancies can be attributed to the type of
serological assay used, but this solves only a part of the problem. We performed 
a meta-analysis of studies performed with the broadly used Wantai HEV-IgG ELISA
and found striking differences that remain difficult to understand with the
current knowledge of transmission pathways.
