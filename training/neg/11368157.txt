We prepared an extensive set of DNA restriction fragments, irradiated them with
UV light, and detected crosslinked complementary strands by electrophoresis in
denaturing agarose gels. These experimental data were quantified by densitometry 
to determine tetranucleotide contributions to crosslinking. The tetranucleotide
contributions were used to predict genomic maps of the crosslinking probability
that permitted us to identify two strongly crosslinking genomic regions having
295 and 389 base pairs in length. The two sequences shared the
(ATTTTATA).(TATAAAAT) octamer, which is a candidate for the hotspot of UV
light-induced crosslinking between the complementary strands of DNA.
