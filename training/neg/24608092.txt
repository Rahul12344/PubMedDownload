AIM: To study long-term mortality and causes of death in a cohort of drug users
in relation to main type of drug use and HIV-status.
METHODS: A total of 1640 hospitalized drug users in Stockholm was followed up
from 1985 to the end of 2007. The mortality was compared with the general Swedish
population and hazard ratios (HR) for the main risk indicators were calculated.
The causes of death were studied, using information from death certificates.
RESULTS: 630 persons died during the observation period. The Standard Mortality
Ratio (SMR) was 16.1 (males 13.8, females 18.5). The crude mortality rate was 2.0
% (males 2.2% and females 1.5%). The mortality rate was higher in heroin users
than among amphetamine users, HR 1.96, controlled for age and other risk factors.
The mortality rate among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) was high (4.9 %), HR 2.64, compared with HIV-negative individuals.
Most of the deaths were from other causes than acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. One-third of deaths (227) were caused by heroin intoxication. The
number of deaths from HIV-related causes decreased after 1996, when highly active
anti-retroviral therapy was introduced. In all, there were 92 HIV-related deaths.
Deaths from natural causes increased during the observation period. The SMR was
highest for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases. The results indicate a 
correlation between amphetamine use and death from cerebral haemorrhage. A high
proportion of natural deaths were alcohol-related.
CONCLUSIONS: The death rate among illicit drug users was persistently high.
Alcohol consumption was a contributing factor to premature death.
