Invasive aspergillus sinusitis invasive is a rare, life threatening infection
observed in immunocompromised patients. We report three cases of patients with
AIDS. Diagnosis was based on surgical biopsy specimen performed on patients with 
unilateral sinusitis with facial pain and osteolysis on CT scanning, associated
in one patient with neurological disorders. One patient with frontal sinusitis
and meningeal involvement died despite therapy. One patient with limited
maxillary sinusitis who underwent surgical satisfactory resection and antifungal 
therapy was successfully treated without relapse 12 months later. One patient
with orbital and cavernous sinus extension of ethmoiditis was successfully cured 
with antifungal therapy by itraconazole. Our results confirm the necessity of
early diagnosis when clinical and CTscanning are suggestive and the curability of
aspergillus sinusitis.
