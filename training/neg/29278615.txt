BACKGROUND: Perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) children have elevated
risk of late language emergence at 1 year of age, with possible links to in utero
antiretroviral (ARV) exposure. We investigated possible risks for speech
impairments (SIs) and language impairments (LI) in preschool monolingual HEU
children in the United States.
METHODS: Speech and language assessments were conducted as part of the Pediatric 
HIV/AIDS Cohort Study Surveillance Monitoring of ART Toxicities study at ages 3
(N = 208) and 5 (N = 429) years. Domains of speech, overall language, vocabulary 
and grammar were assessed. SI and LI were defined by standardized scores <15th
percentile and categorized as primary (normal nonverbal IQ â‰¥ 85 without hearing
loss) and concomitant (low nonverbal IQ and/or presence of hearing loss).
Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds of SI and LI for different 
ARV exposures, adjusted for confounding variables.
RESULTS: The risk for language impairments in HEU children was higher than
population norms; risk for SIs was not elevated. Risk factors for impairments
included male sex, black race and other socioeconomic measures, although these
varied by age, primary (P) versus concomitant (C) impairment and by speech or
language measure. Adjusted logistic regression models revealed lower and
increased risk for specific ARVs. Tenofovir exposure was associated with
increased risk for SI at 3 years of age but was associated with decreased risk
for concomitant language impairment at 5 years of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation of combination ARV exposure and
speech/language impairment among preschool children is needed to confirm
associations.
