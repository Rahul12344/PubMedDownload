Miniature electromechanical systems form a class of bioMEMS that can provide
appropriate sensitivity. In this research, a thermo-electro-mechanical model is
presented to detect biological particles in the microscale. Identification in the
model is based on analyzing pull-in instability parameters and frequency shifts. 
Here, governing equations are derived via the extended Hamilton's principle. The 
coupled effects of system parameters such as surface layer energy, electric field
correction, and material properties are incorporated in this thermosensitive
model. Afterward, the accuracy of the present model and obtained results are
validated with experimental, analytical, and numerical data for several cases.
Performing a parametric study reveals that mechanical properties of biosensors
can significantly affect the detection sensitivity of actuated ultra-small
detectors and should be taken into account. Furthermore, it is shown that the
number or dimension of deposited particles on the sensing zone can be estimated
by investigating the changes in the threshold voltage, electrode deflection, and 
frequency shifts. The present analysis is likely to provide pertinent guidelines 
to design thermal switches and miniature detectors with the desired performance. 
The developed biosensor is more appropriate to detect and characterize viruses in
samples with different temperatures.
