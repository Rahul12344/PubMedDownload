A subset of viral genes is required for the long-term latent infection of
hematopoietic cells by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we show that a
latency-associated gene product (LUNA) promotes the disruption of cellular PML
bodies during latency. Mutation and inhibitor studies reveal that LUNA encodes a 
deSUMOylase activity responsible for this disruption. Specifically, LUNA encodes 
a conserved Asp-Cys-Gly motif common to all deSUMOylases. Importantly, mutation
of the putative catalytic cysteine is sufficient to reverse LUNA-mediated PML
dispersal and markedly reduces the efficiency of viral reactivation. The
depletion of PML from cells is sufficient to rescue the reactivation of the
LUNA-deficient viruses, arguing that targeting PML is an important biological
role of LUNA. Finally, we demonstrate that reactivation of naturally latent HCMV 
is blocked by deSUMOylase inhibitors. Thus, latent HCMV primes the cellular
environment for efficient reactivation via the activity of a virally encoded
deSUMOylase.
