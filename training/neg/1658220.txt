Parainfluenza virus type 3 (Para 3) is an important childhood pathogen causing a 
significant amount of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants. Virus data were
analysed over a twelve-year period (1978-1989), and a peak incidence of infection
was observed in spring as in Houston, USA, unlike in the United Kingdom where
summer epidemics appear to be the norm. The temperature ranges were analysed in
the different study areas during Para 3 epidemics and similar ranges in
temperature were noted which might provide an explanation for the apparently
discordant findings in seasonality reported from different parts of the world.
