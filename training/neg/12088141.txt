Progress toward poliomyelitis eradication--Pakistan and Afghanistan, January
2000-April 2002.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Since 1988, when the World Health Assembly resolved to eradicate poliomyelitis
worldwide, the estimated global incidence of polio has decreased 99%. Pakistan
began polio eradication activities in 1994 and Afghanistan in 1997. Although
polio remains endemic in the two countries, both the incidence and the geographic
distribution of poliovirus have been reduced substantially. This report
summarizes progress toward eradicating polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan during
January 2000-April 2002. Both countries aim to stop transmission of poliovirus by
the end of 2002; however, the unstable security situation in the region might
threaten this success.
