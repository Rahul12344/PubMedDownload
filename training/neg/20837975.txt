Toxicity studies of intranasally administered, live attenuated influenza virus
vaccine candidates conducted in male and female ferrets led to the microscopic
observation of individual differences in the size of nasal turbinates, especially
in the dorsal aspect of the nasal cavity. The association of these enlarged
turbinates with acute to subacute inflammation, which is sometimes common in
ferrets given live attenuated influenza virus vaccine candidates, led to this
detailed microscopic evaluation of turbinate enlargement (cartilaginous and
osseous thickening, or COT) in control animals dosed intranasally with saline.
Results of this evaluation led to the conclusion that COT is a normal
developmental feature of growing ferrets, irrespective of inflammation in nasal
tissues or inflammatory exudate in the nasal cavity.
