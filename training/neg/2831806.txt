3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) has been administered to 7 patients with
human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological disease: 3 with dementia, 2 
with peripheral neuropathy, 1 with dementia and peripheral neuropathy, and 1 with
T-10 paraplegia. Six of the patients showed improvement in their neurological
dysfunction on being administered AZT, as assessed by clinical evaluation,
neuropsychological testing, nerve conduction studies, and/or positron emission
tomographic scans. Three of these 6 patients showed sustained improvement 5 to 18
months after the initiation of AZT therapy. These results suggest that certain
human immunodeficiency virus-associated neurological abnormalities are at least
partially reversible following the administration of antiretroviral therapy and
provide a rationale for further studies using antiretroviral chemotherapy.
