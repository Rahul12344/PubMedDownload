Monoclonal antibodies IPO-1--IPO-8 against surface antigens of B-lymphoblastoid
cell line RPMI-1788 were prepared. Murine hybridomas were obtained by fusion of
immune spleen cells and myeloma cells. Screening of specific antibody production 
was carried out by indirect immunofluorescence. Expression of these antibodies
against a panel of 11 human cell lines was carried out by indirect
immunofluorescence. Expression of antigens detected with IPO-1--IPO-8 were
investigated on peripheral blood cells of healthy individuals and patients with
CLL, ALL, myeloma and on lymph node cells of patients with Hodgkin's disease.
Specificity of these MoAbs is discussed. IPO-5 is shown to react with the
HLA-related determinant. The antibody IPO-3 appears to recognize a
differentiation antigen of human B cells.
