To determine the influence of HIV-1 replication on immunologic decline and
clinical outcome, we quantified the HIV-1 plasma viral load in 20 patients at
different times over a mean period of 10.8 months. Quantitation was performed by 
branched DNA signal amplification (bDNA) and p24 antigenemia. Immunologic status 
was assessed through beta 2-microglobulin and CD4+ cell count determinations.
CD4+ cell decline was expressed as a slope of the regression line constructed by 
the logarithms of CD4+ cell count observations. Mean values of plasma viral load 
were correlated with CD4+ cell decline and mean beta 2-microglobulin levels.
Significant correlation was observed between plasma viral load quantified by the 
bDNA technique and CD4+ cell decline. No significant correlation was observed
between plasma viral load quantified by p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell decline. A 
significant correlation was observed between plasma viral load and beta
2-microglobulin levels. Immunologic decline was better predicted from HIV-1 RNA
levels than from the CD4+ cell count. Significantly higher plasma viral load was 
observed in patients who had clinical progression of HIV-1 infection. Thus, HIV-1
plasma viral load quantified by a highly reliable technique such as bDNA showed
that the immunologic decline is closely related to HIV-1 RNA replication.
