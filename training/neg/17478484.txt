Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for the development of
cervical cancer and its premalignant lesions in women. The virus-encoded oncogene
E6 is a promising target for an anti-HPV drug therapy. The authors describe the
development of a homogenous screening assay for inhibitors of the E6 interaction 
with its cellular target, the E6-associated protein (E6AP), based on AlphaScreen 
technology. The E6 protein was expressed and purified as glutathione
S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, and the binding to a biotinylated E6AP
peptide was monitored using GST-detecting Acceptor beads coated either with
anti-GST antibody or glutathione. After optimization of the assay conditions, a
commercial library of 3000 compounds was screened for inhibitors. Active
compounds were retested and counterscreened for E6/E6AP specificity using
biotinylated GST as a control protein. The results obtained with both types of
GST-detecting reagents correlated very well and demonstrated the great potential 
of the newly developed glutathione-coated Acceptor beads as a detection reagent
for GST fusion proteins.
