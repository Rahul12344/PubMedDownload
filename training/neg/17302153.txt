Newcastle disease virus (NDV) field strain SQZ04 was isolated from a broiler
flock with typical symptoms and lesions, and cloned by plaque-purification three 
times. NDV SQZ04 was determined as a virulent strain with MDT of 50.5h and 51.2h,
ICPI of 2.0 and 1.92, IVPI of 2.8 and 2.68 respectively before and after
plaque-purification. Analysis of F gene indicated that SQZO4 was determined as a 
virulent gene type II , and its protein amino acid sequence has homologies of
99.3% , 98.7% and 96.9% with published gene type II vaccine strains LaSota, B1,
virulent strain Taxas48,much higher than homologies of 88.3% - 88.6% or 91.3% -
92.1% with published gene types VI and IX. This is the first virulent field
strain of gene type UI reported in China. Further more, the amino acid sequence
111 GGRQGRL117 in the F protein cleavage site in SQZ04 strain is identical to
lentogenic strains of NDV, such as vaccine strains LaSota, B1. This is the first 
report that virulent NDV could have lentogenic amino acid sequence in the
cleavage site of F protein, where HN genes was compared SQZ04 has a higher
homologies of 95.3%- 97.3% with known velogenic strains, but lower homologies of 
87.8% - 89.5% with published lentogenic strains.
