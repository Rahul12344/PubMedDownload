BACKGROUND: Rodents are natural reservoirs of hantaviruses, which cause two
disease types: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia and hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome in North America. Hantaviruses related human cases have been
observed throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, and North America. To date, 23 distinct
species of hantaviruses, hosted by reservoir, have been identified. However, the 
diversity and number of hantaviruses are likely underestimated in China, and
hantavirus species that cause disease in many regions, including Yunnan province,
are unknown.
RESULTS: In August 2012, we collected tissue samples from 189 captured animals,
including 15 species belonging to 10 genera, 5 families, and 4 orders in Fugong
county, Yunnan province, China. Seven species were positive for hantavirus:
Eothenomys eleusis (42/94), Apodemus peninsulae (3/25), Niviventer eha (3/27),
Cryptotis montivaga (2/8), Anourosorex squamipes (1/1), Sorex araneus (1/1), and 
Mustela sibirica (1/2). We characterized one full-length genomic sequence of the 
virus (named fugong virus, FUGV) from a small oriental vole (Eothenomys eleusis).
The full-length sequences of the small, medium, and large segments of FUGV were
1813, 3630, and 6531 nt, respectively. FUGV was most closely related to
hantavirus LX309, a previously reported species detected in the red-backed vole
in Luxi county, Yunnan province, China. However, the amino acid sequences of
nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (G), and large protein (L) were highly divergent
from those of Hantavirus LX309, with amino acid differences of 11.2, 15.3, and
12.7 %, respectively. In phylogenetic trees, FUGV clustered in the lineage
corresponding to hantaviruses carried by rodents in the subfamily Arvicolinae.
CONCLUSIONS: High prevalence of hantavirus infection in small mammals was found
in Fugong county, Yunnan province, China. A novel hantavirus species FUGV was
identified from the small oriental vole. This virus is phylogenetic clustering
with another hantavirus LX309, but shows highly genomic divergence.
