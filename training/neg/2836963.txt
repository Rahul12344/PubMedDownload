Cases of typical dermatitis were observed on nineteen broiler farms in the
province of Gelderland, the Netherlands, ever since 1984. These bloody
inflammations occasionally caused a large number of rejects, particularly during 
the second and third weeks of life. A relationship with Gumboro disease was
identified in a number of cases. The causative agent probably is a virus
originating from birds of the broiler-breeding poultry flocks. This may possibly 
be the Chicken Anaemia Agent virus.
