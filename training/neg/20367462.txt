Viral diseases are an important limiting factor in many crop production systems. 
Because antiviral products are not available, control strategies rely on genetic 
resistance or hygienic measures to prevent viral diseases, or on eradication of
diseased crops to control such diseases. Increasing international travel and
trade of plant materials enhances the risk of introducing new viruses and their
vectors into production systems. In addition, changing climate conditions can
contribute to a successful spread of newly introduced viruses or their vectors
and establishment of these organisms in areas that were previously unfavorable.
Tomato is economically the most important vegetable crop worldwide and many
viruses infecting tomato have been described, while new viral diseases keep
emerging. Pepino mosaic virus is a rapidly emerging virus which has established
itself as one of the most important viral diseases in tomato production worldwide
over recent years. Begomovirus species and other whitefly-transmitted viruses are
invading into new areas, and several recently described new viruses such as
Tomato torrado virus and new Tospovirus species are rapidly spreading over large 
geographic areas. In this article, emerging viruses of tomato crops are
discussed.
