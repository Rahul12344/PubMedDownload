The endogenous retroviral envelope protein syncytin is involved in cell fusions
and has also been associated with immunomodulatory functions. Syncytin is
currently known to be expressed in the placenta, testis and brain as well as in
breast and endometrial carcinomas. Using a newly developed monoclonal syncytin
antibody we have assessed syncytin expression in a retrospective series of 140
colorectal cancer patients. Variable degrees of syncytin expression were detected
in both colonic and rectal tumors and the prognostic impact of such expression
was analysed with the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazard model. 
Interestingly, increased syncytin expression was associated with decreased
overall survival in rectal but not in colonic cancer patients. Thus, the
prognostic impact of syncytin expression appears to vary with the tumor type.
