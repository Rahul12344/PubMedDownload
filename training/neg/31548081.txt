BACKGROUND: Vaccinating infants with a first dose of measles-containing vaccine
(MCV1) before 9 months of age in high-risk settings has the potential to reduce
measles-related morbidity and mortality. However, there is concern that early
vaccination might blunt the immune response to subsequent measles vaccine doses. 
We systematically reviewed the available evidence on the effect of MCV1
administration to infants younger than 9 months on their immune responses to
subsequent MCV doses.
METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched for randomised
and quasi-randomised controlled trials, outbreak investigations, and cohort and
case-control studies without restriction on publication dates, in which MCV1 was 
administered to infants younger than 9 months. We did the literature search on
June 2, 2015, and updated it on Jan 14, 2019. We included studies reporting data 
on strength or duration of humoral and cellular immune responses, and on vaccine 
efficacy or vaccine effectiveness after two-dose or three-dose MCV schedules. Our
outcome measures were proportion of seropositive infants, geometric mean titre,
vaccine efficacy, vaccine effectiveness, antibody avidity index, and T-cell
stimulation index. We used random-effects meta-analysis to derive pooled
estimates of the outcomes, where appropriate. We assessed the methodological
quality of included studies using Grading of Recommendation Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines.
FINDINGS: Our search retrieved 1156 records and 85 were excluded due to
duplication. 1071 records were screened for eligibility, of which 351 were
eligible for full-text screening and 21 were eligible for inclusion in the
review. From 13 studies, the pooled proportion of infants seropositive after two 
MCV doses, with MCV1 administered before 9 months of age, was 98% (95% CI 96-99; 
I2=79·8%, p<0·0001), which was not significantly different from seropositivity
after a two-dose MCV schedule starting later (p=0·087). Only one of four studies 
found geometric mean titres after MCV2 administration to be significantly lower
when MCV1 was administered before 9 months of age than at 9 months of age or
later. There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect of age at MCV1
administration on antibody avidity. The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate
derived from two studies of a two-dose MCV schedule with MCV1 vaccination before 
9 months of age was 95% (95% CI 89-100; I2=12·6%, p=0·29). Seven studies
reporting on measles virus-specific cellular immune responses found that T-cell
responses and T-cell memory were sustained, irrespective of the age of MCV1
administration. Overall, the quality of evidence was moderate to very low.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that administering MCV1 to infants younger
than 9 months followed by additional MCV doses results in high seropositivity,
vaccine effectiveness, and T-cell responses, which are independent of the age at 
MCV1, supporting the vaccination of very young infants in high-risk settings.
However, we also found some evidence that MCV1 administered to infants younger
than 9 months resulted in lower antibody titres after one or two subsequent doses
of MCV than when measles vaccination is started at age 9 months or older. The
clinical and public-health relevance of this immunity blunting effect are
uncertain.
