INTRODUCTION: Optimal pharmacotherapy includes utilization of the right drug, at 
the right time, right duration of therapy and adequate dosage. This study
analyzed utilization of antimicrobial drugs at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases 
of the Clinical Center Novi Sad and in outpatients of the Outpatient General
Service of the Health Center Novi Sad-Liman.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Utilization of anti-infective agents was examined according
to Anatomic-Therapeutic-Chemical Classification (group J). Drug utilization data 
were presented in Defined Daily Doses at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases of the
Clinical Center Novi Sad in Defined Daily Doses per 100 bed-days, and in the
Outpatient General Service of the Health Center Novi Sad-Liman in Defined Daily
Doses/1000 inhabitants per day.
RESULTS: At the Clinic of Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Center Novi Sad
penicillins susceptible to beta-lactamase were established as most frequently
used (39.33%) namely: benzylpenicillin (32.18%), quinolone antibacterial agents, 
ciprofloxacin (12.44%) and cephalosporins, cephalexin (8.25%). In the Outpatient 
General Service of the Health Center Novi Sad-Liman most frequently used were
extended-spectrum penicillins (24.20%) namely: tetracyclines, doxycycline
(18.98%), amoxicillin (18.27%), macrolides, roxithromycin (17.56%). At the Clinic
of Infectious Diseases of the Clinical Center Novi Sad the decision on using
antibiotics and establishing whether it was bacterial or virus infection in
92.13% cases was made on the basis of following analyses: throat and nasal swabs,
urine culture, virus complement-binding reaction. In Outpatient General Service
of the Health Center Novi Sad-Liman it was done only in 18.46%.
CONCLUSION: Although treatment performed based on clinical picture and experience
usually proves to be correct, antibiotic prescription policy should include
antibiograms to provide optimal treatment and decrease the degree of resistance. 
Thus, medicine would be considered an exact science and it should be one of its
goals of the 21st century.
