Leishmaniasis is rarely encountered in southern Africa. Two cases were diagnosed 
by histopathology in northern Malawi in one year. One was an 18 months old child 
with negative human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) serology and widespread skin
lesions; the other an HIV-1 positive adult with 2 skin lesions. The Leishmania
species responsible could not be identified, but the infection may be more
prevalent in this region than previously thought.
