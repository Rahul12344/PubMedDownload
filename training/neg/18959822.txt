Turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) is a positive strand RNA virus that infects
mainly Cruciferae plants. In this study, the TYMV genome was modified by
inserting an extra subgenomic RNA promoter and a multiple cloning site. This
modified TYMV was introduced into Nicotiana benthamiana using a
Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA transfer system (agroinfiltration). When a gene
encoding beta-glucuronidase or green fluorescent protein was expressed using this
modified TYMV as a vector, replication of the recombinant viruses, especially the
virus containing beta-glucuronidase gene, was severely inhibited. The suppression
of replication was reduced by co-expression of viral silencing suppressor genes, 
such as tombusviral p19, closteroviral p21 or potyviral HC-Pro. As expected, two 
subgenomic RNAs were produced from the recombinant TYMV, where the larger one
contained the foreign gene. An RNase protection assay revealed that the
recombinant subgenomic RNA was encapsidated as efficiently as the genuine
subgenomic RNA.
