Tick-borne encephalitis virus is localized in nerve cells and intracellular
spaces. According to the nature of ultrastructural changes, the pathological
process in nerve cells may be divided into three stages connected with the stages
of virus reproduction. In the first stage, the protein-synthesizing systems of
the cell are degraded. In the second stage specific virus inclusions form in the 
cell cytoplasm as aggregates of mature and immature virions alongside with
destruction of ultrastructures and growth of smooth membranes. In the third stage
degradation of neurons is accompanied by necrobiosis and discomplexation of the
surrounding glial elements, processes, cells of the inflammatory infiltrate and
capillary walls. A certain combination of nonspecific changes in organelles of
various cells with viral inclusions makes the ultrastructural picture of the
focus of lesions in tick-borne encephalitis sufficiently characteristic for
differential pathological diagnosis.
