We review mathematical modeling and related statistical issues of HIV dynamics
primarily in response to antiretroviral drug therapy in this article. We start
from a basic model of virus infection and then review a number of more advanced
models with consideration of pharmacokinetic factors, adherence and drug
resistance. Specifically, we illustrate how mathematical models can be developed 
and parameterized to understand the effects of long-term treatment and different 
treatment strategies on disease progression. In addition, we discuss a variety of
parameter estimation methods for differential equation models that are applicable
to either within- or between-host viral dynamics.
