The chromosomal location of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA sequences
integrated in a cell line derived from argyrophil small cell carcinoma of the
uterine cervix was determined by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH). The HPV 16 DNA sequences were integrated near a fragile site and the
location of the c-myc oncogene at 8q24.1. Amplification of the integrated viral
sequences resulted in an abnormally banded region. The amplified HPV 16 DNA
sequences were also detected in every interphase nucleus by FISH.
