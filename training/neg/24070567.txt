INTRODUCTION: Adenovirus causing severe fatal pneumonia has been well described
in infants, children, and patients with immunocompromised function, but reports
in previously healthy adults are rare. We report 3 cases of severe adenovirus
pneumonia in whom conventional mechanical ventilation failed and required
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
METHODS: Retrospective case records review of 3 patients admitted to the medical 
intensive care unit, Singapore General Hospital, a tertiary care
university-affiliated hospital, with severe adenovirus pneumonia requiring
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support from February to March 2013.
RESULTS: All 3 patients were previously healthy immunocompetent adults from the
community with negative HIV serology. Duration prior to development of
respiratory failure requiring intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation was 
2, 8 and 3 days. Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support
as rescue ventilation was instituted in all 3 patients after 2, 16, and 5 days of
conventional mechanical ventilator support. Duration on ECMO support was 16, 22, 
and 9 days and mechanical ventilation was 18, 62, and 19 days respectively.
Length of stay in intensive care unit was 18, 68, and 21 days, and length of stay
in hospital was 20, 70, and 31 days respectively. Two of the 3 patients died.
CONCLUSION: The mainstay of treatment for patients with severe adenovirus
pneumonia is still supportive, with the use of antivirals not apparently
effective. Whilst ECMO support for rescue ventilation may be considered, the
outcomes do not appear as promising as other viral pneumonias, mirroring that
previously described in the paediatric population.
