Human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines HSC4 and SAS were infected
with wild type p53 (wt-p53)-encoding adenovirus (AxCAip53) and subsequently
irradiated to investigate the effectiveness of p53 gene therapy in combination
with radiation therapy for treating oral SCC. Western blot analysis using
anti-p53 monoclonal antibody showed that a large amount of mutant p53 protein was
accumulated in HSC4 cells, while no detectable p53 protein was observed in SAS
cells. The induction of p53 expression by AxCAip53 infection was clearly observed
in both HSC4 and SAS cells. A clonogenic cell survival assay demonstrated that
AxCAip53 infection alone, or X-irradiation alone, significantly inhibited the
growth of cancer cells, but that combined treatment was most effective, even in
mutant p53-accumulated HSC4 cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the
apoptotic pathway was induced in virus treated and radiation treated cells. Taken
together, these findings suggest that the combination of p53 gene therapy and
radiation therapy has a possibility to effectively treat oral SCC defective in
p53 function.
