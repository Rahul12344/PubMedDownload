Patients with the X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (XLPD) are unable to
control Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced infections and lymphoproliferation. This
disease is caused by a deficit of SAP, an adapter protein involved in the signal 
transduction of several cell surface receptors of the CD2 superfamily. One of
these receptors, called 2B4, is expressed on NK cells, cytotoxic T cells and
myeloid cells and activates NK cell cytotoxicity. Here we show that XLPD patients
have a defect of 2B4 receptor-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity. This defect may
contribute to the pathogenesis of XLPD by reducing NK cell lysis of EBV-infected 
B cells.
