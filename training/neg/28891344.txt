BACKGROUND: Substance use, particularly injection drug use, continues to fuel the
HIV/HCV (hepatitis C virus) epidemics in San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR).
AIM: This article examines individual and sociostructural factors that affect
HIV/HCV risk among people who use drugs (PWUD) living with or at risk for HIV/HCV
in San Juan, PR. Findings were used to inform a community-level intervention to
enhance HIV care access and retention for this population.
METHOD: A rapid ethnographic assessment in collaboration with a community-based
organization was conducted. Data collection took place between June and December 
2013 and included field observations, 49 unstructured interviews with PWUD, and
19 key informant interviews with community stakeholders. Fieldnotes, photographs,
and interview transcripts were analyzed for recurrent themes and to address the
intervention-planning needs. Study results are presented as fieldnote excerpts,
direct quotes from interviews, and photographs.
RESULTS: Findings suggest that PWUD in PR face myriad challenges that affect
HIV/HCV risk and hinder linkage to and retention in care. Results describe a
layered risk environment where PWUD encounter many barriers to prevention, care, 
and treatment such as transience, social isolation, stigma, limited housing
options, and inadequate medical and substance use disorder treatment services.
DISCUSSION: These observed circumstances provide an empirical basis for the
development and evaluation of comprehensive interventions that may serve to
reduce barriers to care and link individuals to other supportive services.
CONCLUSION: New approaches and comprehensive interventions are needed to break
the structures that perpetuate risk and lack of engagement and retention in HIV
care and substance use disorder treatment in San Juan.
