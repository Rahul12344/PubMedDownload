Bat rabies in british columbia 1971-1985.

Prins B, Loewen K.

Rabies virus was demonstrated in 99 of 1154 bats submitted from British Columbia 
between 1971 and 1985. Rabies was diagnosed in seven species including big brown 
bats (Eptesicus fuscus), the latter accounting for 51% of all positive cases.
Colonial species represented 92.9% of all identified bats and 87.7% of all rabid 
cases. Most bats were submitted from the more densely populated areas of the
province, and submissions and positive cases both peaked in the month of August. 
Daytime activity and inability to fly were the most common behaviors reported in 
rabid bats.
