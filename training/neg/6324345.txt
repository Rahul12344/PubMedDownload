Antibodies reactive with human T-lymphotropic retroviruses (HTLV-III) in the
serum of patients with AIDS.

In cats, infection with T-lymphotropic retroviruses can cause T-cell
proliferation and leukemia or T-cell depletion and immunosuppression. In humans, 
some highly T4 tropic retroviruses called HTLV-I can cause T-cell proliferation
and leukemia. The subgroup HTLV-II also induces T-cell proliferation in vitro,
but its role in disease is unclear. Viruses of a third subgroup of human
T-lymphotropic retroviruses, collectively designated HTLV-III, have been isolated
from cultured cells of 48 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS). The biological properties of HTLV-III and immunological analyses of its
proteins show that this virus is a member of the HTLV family, and that it is more
closely related to HTLV-II than to HTLV-I. Serum samples from 88 percent of
patients with AIDS and from 79 percent of homosexual men with signs and symptoms 
that frequently precede AIDS, but from less than 1 percent of heterosexual
subjects, have antibodies reactive against antigens of HTLV-III. The major immune
reactivity appears to be directed against p41, the presumed envelope antigen of
the virus.
