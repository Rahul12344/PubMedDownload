The effects of specific antibodies in chronic echovirus type 5 (echo 5)
encephalitis were investigated in a patient with x-linked hypogammaglobulinemia. 
Virus was detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood despite treatment with 
commercial human gammaglobulin that contained low titers of antibodies to echo 5 
(0.6 x 10(4) units per injection). Virus disappeared from blood and CSF when
plasma containing high concentrations of antibodies (total dose, 1--4 x 10(4)
units/kg) was administered intravenously. Maximal inhibition of virus was
achieved in culture and in the patient's CSF when the titer of antibody to echo 5
in CSF was greater than or equal to 16 units/ml. Although the patient died,
hyperimmune plasma improved the neurologic status and eliminated detectable virus
from the blood and CSF.
