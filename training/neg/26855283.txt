Complex regulation of viral transcription patterns and DNA replication levels is 
a feature of many DNA viruses. This is especially true for those viruses which
establish latent or persistent infections (e.g., herpesviruses, papillomaviruses,
polyomaviruses, or adenovirus), as long-term persistence often requires
adaptation of gene expression programs and/or replication levels to the cellular 
milieu. A key factor in the control of such processes is the establishment of a
specific chromatin state on promoters or replication origins, which in turn will 
determine whether or not the underlying DNA is accessible for other factors that 
mediate downstream processes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful 
technique to investigate viral chromatin, in particular to study binding patterns
of modified histones, transcription factors or other DNA-/chromatin-binding
proteins that regulate the viral lifecycle. Here, we provide protocols that are
suitable for performing ChIP-PCR and ChIP-Seq studies on chromatin of large and
small viral genomes.
