The conventional microtubule-dependent motor protein kinesin consists of heavy
and light chains both of which have been documented to bind a variety of
potential linker or cargo proteins. In this study we employed a yeast two-hybrid 
assay to identify additional binding partners of the kinesin heavy chain isoform 
KIF5B. A human brain cDNA library was screened with a bait corresponding to amino
acid residues 814-963 of human KIF5B. This screen identified the ribosome
receptor, p180, as a KIF5B-binding protein. The sites of interaction are residues
1294-1413 of p180 and the C-terminal half of the cargo binding-domain of KIF5B
(residues 867-907). The KIF5B-binding site in p180 is homologous to the
previously determined KIF5B-binding site in kinectin. The interacting regions of 
p180 and KIF5B consist almost entirely of heptad repeats, suggesting the
interaction is a coiled-coil. A role for the kinesin/p180 interaction may include
mRNA localization and/or transport of endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles.
