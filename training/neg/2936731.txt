Cloning and characterization of the polC region of Bacillus subtilis.

Ott RW, Barnes MH, Brown NC, Ganesan AT.

The polC gene of Bacillus subtilis is defined by five temperature-sensitive
mutations and the 6-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)-uracil (HPUra) resistance mutation
azp-12. Biochemical evidence suggests that polC codes for the 160-kilodalton DNA 
polymerase III. A recombinant plasmid, p154t, was isolated and found to contain
the azp-12 marker and one end of the polC gene (N. C. Brown and M. H. Barnes, J. 
Cell. Biochem. 78 [Suppl.]: 116, 1983). The azp-12 marker was localized to a
1-kilobase DNA segment which was used as a probe to isolate recombinant lambda
phages containing polC region sequences. A complete polC gene was constructed by 
in vitro ligation of DNA segments derived from two of the recombinant phages. The
resulting plasmid, pRO10, directed the synthesis of four proteins of 160, 76, 39,
and 32 kilodaltons in Escherichia coli maxicells. Recombination-deficient (recE) 
B. subtilis PSL1 containing pRO10 produced an HPUra-resistant polymerase III
activity which was lost when the strain was cured of pRO10. In vivo, the HPUra
resistance of the plasmid-encoded polymerase III appeared to be recessive to the 
resident HPUra-sensitive polymerase III enzyme.
