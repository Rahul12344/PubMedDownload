The aphid Amphorophora agathonica Hottes (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is an important
virus vector in red (Rubus idaeus L.) and black (Rubus occidentalis L.)
raspberries in North America. Raspberry resistance to A. agathonica in the form
of a single dominant gene named Ag1 has been relied upon to help control
aphid-transmitted plant viruses; however, the mechanism of resistance to the
insect is poorly understood. Aphid feeding was monitored using an electrical
penetration graph on the resistant red raspberry 'Tulameen' and compared with a
susceptible control, 'Vintage'. There were no differences in pathway feeding
behaviors of aphids as they moved toward the phloem. Once in the phloem, however,
aphids feeding on resistant plants spent significantly more time salivating than 
on susceptible plants, and ingested significantly less phloem sap. This suggests 
that a mechanism for resistance to A. agathonica is located in the phloem.
Reduced ingestion of phloem may result in inefficient acquisition of viruses and 
is a likely explanation for the lack of aphid-transmitted viruses in plantings of
resistant cultivars.
