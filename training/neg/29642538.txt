Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD)-box polypeptide 5 (DDX5), also called p68, is a
prototypical member of the large ATP-dependent RNA helicases family and is known 
to participate in all aspects of RNA metabolism ranging from transcription to
translation, RNA decay, and miRNA processing. The roles of DDX5 in cell cycle
regulation, tumorigenesis, apoptosis, cancer development, adipogenesis,
Wnt-Î²-catenin signaling, and viral infection have been established. Several RNA
viruses have been reported to hijack DDX5 to facilitate various steps of their
replication cycles. Furthermore, DDX5 can be bounded by the viral proteins of
some viruses with unknown functions. Interestingly, an antiviral function of DDX5
has been reported during hepatitis B virus and myxoma virus infection. Thus, the 
precise roles of this apparently multifaceted protein remain largely obscure.
Here, we provide a rapid and critical overview of the structure and functions of 
DDX5 with a particular emphasis on its role during virus infection.
