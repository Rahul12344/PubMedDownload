To establish experimental Pneumocystis carinii infection in simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques as a model of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-associated P. carinii pneumonia (PCP),
SIV-infected macaques were inoculated intrabronchially with macaque-derived P.
carinii, and P. carinii-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow
cytometric analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were done biweekly for up to 
44 weeks after inoculation. All inoculated animals had a P. carinii-specific PCR 
product after infection. CD8(+) T cells in lung lavage samples from SIV- and P.
carinii-coinfected animals increased to >90% of total CD3(+) cells, a pattern
associated with naturally acquired P. carinii infection. Progression of disease
also was correlated with increased neutrophil infiltration to the lungs. The
animals had a protracted period of asymptomatic colonization with P. carinii
before progression to PCP. The development of a model of PCP in SIV-infected
rhesus macaques provides the means to study AIDS-associated PCP.
