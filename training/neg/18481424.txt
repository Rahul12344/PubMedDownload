OBJECTIVE: To construct a recombinant adenovirus vector bearing dual-survivin
short hairpin RNA (shRNA).
METHODS: Dual-survivin shRNA was designed and synthesized respectively, both
inserted into adenovirus DNA. The recombinant adenovirus vector was confirmed via
both sequencing and restriction digestion analysis, and then linearized and
transfected into the HEK 293 cell line to generate recombinant adenoviruses.
RESULTS: The recombinant adenovirus vector was constructed and the target
sequence was obtained.
CONCLUSION: The construction of the recombinant adenovirus vector provides a
basis for the research of potential gene therapy for prostate cancer.
