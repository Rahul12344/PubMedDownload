A series of symmetrical E-stilbene prolinamides that originated from the
library-synthesized lead 3 was studied with respect to HCV genotype 1a (G-1a) and
genotype 1b (G-1b) replicon inhibition and selectivity against BVDV and
cytotoxicity. SAR emerging from an examination of the prolinamide cap region
revealed 11 to be a selective HCV NS5A inhibitor exhibiting submicromolar potency
against both G-1a and G-1b replicons. Additional structural refinements resulted 
in the identification of 30 as a potent, dual G-1a/1b HCV NS5A inhibitor.
