Lassa virus (LASV) is the most prominent human pathogen of the Arenaviridae. The 
virus is transmitted to humans by a rodent reservoir, Mastomys natalensis, and is
capable of causing lethal Lassa Fever (LF). LASV has the highest human impact of 
any of the viral hemorrhagic fevers (with the exception of Dengue Fever) with an 
estimated several hundred thousand infections annually, resulting in thousands of
deaths in Western Africa. The sizeable disease burden, numerous imported cases of
LF in non-endemic countries, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an
agent of biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. Presently
there is no licensed vaccine against LF or approved treatment. Recently, several 
promising vaccine candidates have been developed which can potentially target
different groups at risk. The purpose of this manuscript is to review the LASV
pathogenesis and immune mechanisms involved in protection. The current status of 
pre-clinical development of the advanced vaccine candidates that have been tested
in non-human primates will be discussed. Major scientific, manufacturing, and
regulatory challenges will also be considered.
