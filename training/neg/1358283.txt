We used two-color flow cytometric analysis to investigate CD26+ (Ta1+) cells in
peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with human T-lymphotropic virus
type-I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy (HAM). The percentage of CD26+ cells among 
CD3+ cells was markedly increased in patients with HAM, compared with anti-HTLV-I
seropositive carriers (p < 0.001) and seronegative controls (p < 0.01). Within
the subpopulation of T cells, a significantly high percentage of CD26+ cells was 
detected in both CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations. Furthermore, analysis of HLA-DR+
T cells revealed similar results. In contrast CD4+CD45RA+ cells were
significantly decreased in comparison with controls. These results suggest that
immunologically activated or memory T cells found in peripheral blood may be
etiologically relevant to HAM.
