The acquisition of drug resistance in vivo was investigated by 7 serial passages 
(from P0 to P7) of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) in rabbit cornea treated with
either IUdR (idoxuridine), IDC (idoxycytidine), ACV (acyclovir), TFT
(trifluridine), or Ara A (adenine arabinoside). Therapeutic failure was acquired 
gradually: at P3 for IUdR, at P4 for ACV and at P5 for TFT. At P7, viral
thymidine kinase (TK) activity was reduced to 5.6% of the parental strain for
IUdR, to 7.5% for ACV and to 4.6% for TFT treatment. No signs of clinical
unresponsiveness occurred with IDC or Ara A. The in vitro determination of
antiviral drug sensitivity performed by the dye-uptake assay on HSV isolates at
each passage showed a correlation between the increase in the 50% effective dose 
(ED50) and the increase of ulcer area grade at each passage under antiviral drug 
(p less than 0.1). Both IUdR- and TFT-resistant HSV1 developed cross-resistances 
to TK dependent drugs. However ACV-resistant HSV1 did not show cross-resistance
to other antiviral TK dependent drugs. The acquisition of the cross-resistances
is discussed, and the practical implications in case of therapeutic failures are 
suggested.
