Virus-induced modifications in the immunogenicity of red blood cells.

Ghyka GR, Cernescu C.

Studies of the immunogenicity of red blood cells (RBC) modified by interaction
with viral agents show that measles hemagglutinin or adsorption-elution of
influenza virus are able to induce modifications in the RBC immunogenicity,
consisting in a depression of antibody synthesis and in a stimulation of the
cell-mediated immune response. The modifications depend on the extent to which
RBC-surface-bound viral antigens would mask the erythrocyte antigenic
determinants.
