The corneal migration and topographic distribution of Langerhans cells (LC) in
relation to herpes simplex virus antigens was studied during the course of
dendritic keratitis in inbred mice. Corneal epithelial sheets from infected mice 
at selected time points were "double stained" for Ia-positive Langerhans cells
and HSV antigens, using a sequential avidin biotin immunoperoxidase and glucose
oxidase technique. The amount of HSV antigen was maximum at day 2 paralleling the
clinical time course, with most corneal epithelium HSV antigen negative by day 8.
LC were seen in peripheral corneas by day 2 and in paracentral and central cornea
by day 8, with peak numbers detected between days 8 and 11 post-infection.
Although HSV antigens and LC were simultaneously detected within corneal
epithelium, LC were not observed in anatomic juxtaposition to HSV antigens, even 
after reinoculation of infected corneas with HSV on day 14 following the primary 
infection. These data suggest that local factors in the corneal epithelium other 
than HSV antigens per se may be chemotactic for LC during the course of dendritic
keratitis.
