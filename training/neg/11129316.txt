OBJECTIVE: To speculate on the role of universal (population-based) interventions
designed to prevent schizophrenia.
METHOD: A nonsystematic review of candidate risk factors for schizophrenia, with 
particular emphasis on the quality of the evidence, effect size of the risk
factor, population attributable risk and potential for population-based
intervention.
RESULTS: In order to design population-based interventions for the prevention of 
schizophrenia, we need to identify weak but prevalent risk factors. Based on
current knowledge, the leading risk factors for schizophrenia include genes,
season and place of birth, obstetric complications, prenatal exposure to viruses 
and prenatal nutrition. For the nongenetic exposures, we need to consider if
potential interventions are effective, safe, cheap and acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinations and interventions related to improving prenatal
nutrition and antenatal care appear to be the most plausible options for
universal prevention.
