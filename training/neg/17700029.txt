OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) F protein is a newly identified protein
encoded by an alternative open reading frame that +1 overlaps core-encoding gene.
It has been found that regulation of c-myc and p53 genes by HCV core protein is
involved in liver cancer genesis. We wondered whether HCV F protein exerts
similar or adverse regulatory effects on the transcription of c-myc and p53
genes.
METHODS: HCV F gene-containing, plasmid pcDNA3.1-F and HCV core gene-containing
pcDNA3.1-C were constructed and transiently transfected into HepG(2) cells.
Real-time quantitative PCR or Western blotting was used to determine the changes 
at transcription or translation levels of c-myc and p53 genes.
RESULTS: The transcription level of c-myc was much higher in pcDNA3.1-F
transfected cells than those without plasmid transfected. Whereas the level of
p53 transcription in pcDNA3.1-F transfected cells was lower than those in the
parental cells. Moreover, levels of c-myc expression were up-regulated and those 
of p53 expression were down-regulated by HCV F protein.
CONCLUSIONS: HCV F protein is of regulatory properties in cellular oncogene c-myc
and anti-oncogene p53, which may be implicated in the formation of hepatocellular
carcinoma.
