An avian influenza virus (AIV), A/turkey/Israel/09 subtype H6N1, was isolated
from turkey poults exhibiting typical pathology associated with AIV infection.
The virus was characterized by RT-PCR using AIV subtype-specific primers and by
the haemagglutination inhibition test using AIV subtype-specific antisera. The
virus has an intravenous pathogenicity index of 0 and possessed a nucleotide
sequence at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin gene, PQIETR*GLF, associated
with avian influenza viruses of low pathogenicity. Unlike the two previous H6N2
isolates originating from domestic ducks and mallard, the A/turkey/Israel/09
(H6N1) was isolated from turkeys. The gene sequences of the A/turkey/Israel/09
(H6N1) virus show divergence from the former Israeli H6 isolates.
