The levels of soluble CD4 (sCD4) and sCD8 in serum correlate with the T cell
subset activation and may be important in monitoring and characterizing disease
processes during immunological diseases. We compared acute Kawasaki disease (KD) 
with anaphylactoid purpura (AP) and acute febrile viral infections, such as
measles and infectious mononucleosis (IM), in terms of serum sCD4 and sCD8
levels. The levels of serum sCD4 and sCD8 were measured by a sandwich enzyme
immunoassay. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cell subsets were analysed
by single and two-colour flow-cytometric analyses in KD and IM patients. The
levels of serum sCD4 and sCD8 were significantly elevated in patients during
acute stages of KD, measles and IM, but not AP. Peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ and
also HLA-DR+ T cells count did not increase during the acute stage of KD;
however, peripheral blood CD8+ and HLA-DR+ T cell counts were increased during
the acute stage of IM. Our results suggest that there is a low level of
activation of peripheral blood T cells during acute KD, or that infiltrated T
cells in some local tissues of KD patients contribute to the elevated levels of
serum sCD4 and sCD8.
