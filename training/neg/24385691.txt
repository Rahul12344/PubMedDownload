OBJECTIVE: Intratumoral administration of adenoviral vector encoding herpes
simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) gene (Ad-TK) followed by systemic
ganciclovir (GCV) is an effective approach in treating experimental
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, hepatotoxicity due to unwanted vector
spread and suicide gene expression limited the application of this therapy.
miR-122 is an abundant, liver-specific microRNA whose expression is decreased in 
human primary HCC and HCC-derived cell lines. These different expression profiles
provide an opportunity to induce tumor-specific gene expression by miR-122
regulation.
METHODS: By inserting miR-122 target sequences (miR-122T) in the 3' untranslated 
region (UTR) of TK gene, we constructed adenovirus (Ad) vectors expressing
miR-122-regulated TK (Ad-TK-122T) and report genes. After intratumoral
administration of Ad vectors into an orthotopic miR-122-deficient HCC mouse
model, we observed the miR-122-regulated transgene expression and assessed the
antitumor activity and safety of Ad-TK-122T.
RESULTS: Insertion of miR-122T specifically down-regulated transgene expression
in vitro and selectively protected the miR-122-positive cells from killing by
TK/GCV treatment. Insertion of miR-122T led to significant reduction of tansgene 
expression in the liver without inhibition of its expression in tumors in vivo,
resulting in an 11-fold improvement of tumor-specific transgene expression.
Intratumoral injection of Ad vectors mediated TK/GCV system led to a vector
dosage-dependent regression of tumor. The insertion of miR-122T does not
influence the antitumor effects of suicide gene therapy. Whereas mice
administrated with Ad-TK showed severe lethal hepatotoxicity at the effective
therapeutic dose, no liver damage was found in Ad-TK-122T group.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-122-regulated TK expression achieved effective anti-tumor
effects and increased the safety of intratumoral delivery of adenovirus-mediated 
TK/GCV gene therapy for miR-122-deficient HCC.
