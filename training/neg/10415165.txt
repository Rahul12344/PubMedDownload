Prion diseases are associated with the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of
host-encoded prion protein (PrP(Sc)). A number of prion strains can be
distinguished by "glycotyping" analysis of the respective deposited PrP(Sc)
compound. In this study, the long-term proteinase K resistance, the molecular
mass, and the localization of PrP(Sc) deposits derived from conventional and
transgenic mice inoculated with 11 different BSE and scrapie strains or isolates 
were examined. Differences were found in the long-term proteinase K resistance
(50 microg/ml at 37 degrees C) of PrP(Sc). For example, scrapie strain Chandler
or PrP(Sc) derived from field BSE isolates were destroyed after 6 hr of exposure,
whereas PrP(Sc) of strains 87V and ME7 and of the Hessen1 isolate were extremely 
resistant to proteolytic cleavage. Nonglycosylated, proteinase K-treated PrP(Sc) 
of BSE isolates and of scrapie strain 87V exhibited a 1-2 kD lower molecular mass
than PrP(Sc) derived from all other scrapie strains and isolates. With the
exception of strain 87V, PrP(Sc) was generally deposited in the cerebrum,
cerebellum, and brain stem of different mouse lines at comparable levels.
Long-term proteinase resistance, molecular mass, and the analysis of PrP(Sc)
deposition therefore provide useful criteria in discriminating prion strains and 
isolates (e.g., BSE and 87V) that are otherwise indistinguishable by the PrP(Sc) 
"glycotyping" technique.
