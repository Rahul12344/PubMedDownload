The efficacy of three insecticides, fipronil 3G, lambda-cyhalothrin 10%CS, and
sumithion 50EC were evaluated against the dengue vector Aedes albopictus in
discarded tires in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The dosage given for each insecticide 
was 0.01 g of active ingredient/m2. Fipronil 3G was the most effective larvicide 
with a residual activity of up to two weeks, causing 88% mortality in Aedes
albopictus. Lambda-cyhalothrin 10%CS was effective for one week causing 92%
larval mortality and two weeks with 63% larval mortality. Sumithion 50EC had a
residual efficacy of one week with 79% larval mortality.
