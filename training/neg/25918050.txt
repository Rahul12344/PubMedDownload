We evaluated whether phospholemman (PLM) regulates L-type Ca(2+) current (ICa) in
mouse ventricular myocytes. Expression of α1-subunit of L-type Ca(2+) channels
between wild-type (WT) and PLM knockout (KO) hearts was similar. Compared to WT
myocytes, peak ICa (at -10 mV) from KO myocytes was ~41% larger, the inactivation
time constant (τ(inact)) of ICa was ~39% longer, but deactivation time constant
(τ(deact)) was similar. In the presence of isoproterenol (1 μM), peak ICa was
~48% larger and τ(inact) was ~144% higher in KO myocytes. With Ba(2+) as the
permeant ion, PLM enhanced voltage-dependent inactivation but had no effect on
τ(deact). To dissect the molecular determinants by which PLM regulated ICa, we
expressed PLM mutants by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer in cultured KO
myocytes. After 24h in culture, KO myocytes expressing green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) had significantly larger peak ICa and longer τ(inact) than KO myocytes
expressing WT PLM; thereby independently confirming the observations in freshly
isolated myocytes. Compared to KO myocytes expressing GFP, KO myocytes expressing
the cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant (TM43), the non-phosphorylatable S68A
mutant, the phosphomimetic S68E mutant, and the signature PFXYD to alanine (ALL5)
mutant all resulted in lower peak ICa. Expressing PLM mutants did not alter
expression of α1-subunit of L-type Ca(2+) channels in cultured KO myocytes. Our
results suggested that both the extracellular PFXYD motif and the transmembrane
domain of PLM but not the cytoplasmic tail were necessary for regulation of peak 
ICa amplitude. We conclude that PLM limits Ca(2+) influx in cardiac myocytes by
reducing maximal ICa and accelerating voltage-dependent inactivation.
