Although the influence of the chicken classical MHC in resistance to many
diseases is well established, the role of the recently identified, genetically
independent, MHC-like region known as Rfp-Y is unclear. The objectives of this
study were to analyze the frequencies of DNA polymorphisms of the Rfp-Y region in
White Leghorn lines, which were divergently selected in replicate for multitrait 
immunocompetence, and to determine the association of these polymorphisms with
Marek's disease (MD) resistance. Chicks, either with or without herpes virus of
turkey (HVT) vaccination, were challenged with 500 ffu of a very virulent Marek's
disease virus (Md5) at 2 d of age. The MD-related data were collected for 10 wk. 
PvuII-digested genomic DNA was hybridized with an Rfp-Y region-specific probe,
18.1. Three Rfp-Y polymorphisms were observed. The frequency of one Rfp-Y
polymorphism was significantly different between divergently selected multitrait 
immunocompetence lines in one replicate only; therefore, the impact of multitrait
immunocompetence selection on Rfp-Y polymorphisms is inconclusive. The PvuII
defined Rfp-Y region polymorphisms had no association with either innate or
vaccine-induced MD resistance to Md5 virus challenge.
