HIV type I (HIV-1) can cause G(2) cell cycle arrest and death of CD4(+) T
lymphocytes in vitro and inexorable depletion of these cells in vivo. However,
the molecular mechanism of viral cytopathicity has not been satisfactorily
elucidated. Previously, we showed that HIV-1 kills T cells by a necrotic form of 
cell death that requires high level expression of an integrated provirus but not 
the env or nef genes. To determine which viral protein(s) are required for cell
death, we systematically mutated, alone and in combination, the ORFs of the NL4-3
strain of HIV-1. We found that the elimination of the viral functions encoded by 
gag-pol and vpu, tat, and rev did not mitigate cytopathicity. However,
elimination of the vif and vpr accessory genes together, but not individually,
renders the virus incapable of causing cell death and G(2) cell cycle blockade.
We thus identify vif and vpr as necessary for T cell cytopathic effects induced
by HIV-1. These findings may provide an important insight into the molecular
mechanism of viral pathogenesis in AIDS.
