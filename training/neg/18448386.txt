BACKGROUND: Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines require confirmation of 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening-test-positive sera with a low signal/cut-off
(S/CO) ratio by recombinant immunoblot or PCR. The UK Health Protection Agency
has suggested that a second enzyme immunoassay (EIA) could be used as an
alternative for confirmation in non-immunocompromised patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the UK HPA approach in 17,936 consecutive in-house sera
submitted for HCV testing.
STUDY DESIGN: AxSYM-positive sera (S/CO> or =1.0) were tested with Monolisa Plus.
AxSYM-positive sera of patients that were confirmed PCR-positive were considered 
HCV+. All other AxSYM-positive sera were confirmed with immunoblot according to
CDC guidelines.
RESULTS: 17,299 sera were negative with AxSYM. Of the 637 AxSYM-positive sera,
384 were from patients confirmed as PCR-positive. Of other 250 sera, 120 were
negative with immunoblot, 103 were positive and 30 were indeterminate. All 30
immunoblot-indeterminate sera were PCR-negative. Two patients were Monolisa Plus+
and immunoblot- and PCR-. One patient was known as immunoblot-, while the other
patient was diagnosed with non-A non-B hepatitis in 1980s. Nine sera from
HCV-positive patients were Monolisa Plus-. Two PCR- sera were from
immunocompetent patients who were PCR- for > or =8 years and six PCR- sera and
one PCR+ serum were from immunocompromised patients. Sensitivity and specificity 
of confirmation with Monolisa Plus were 98.15% and 98.33% and the positive and
negative predictive values were 99.58% and 92.91% in AxSYM-positive sera
(excluding immunoblot-indeterminate/PCR-negative sera). If immunocompromised
patients that were false-negative were excluded, sensitivity was 99.58%.
CONCLUSION: Monolisa Plus can be used as an alternative to immunoblot for the
confirmation of AxSYM-positive sera.
