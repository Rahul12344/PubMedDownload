The 11th influenza A virus protein PB1-F2 was previously shown to enhance
apoptosis in response to cytotoxic stimuli. The 87 amino acid protein that is
encoded by an alternative reading frame of the PB1 polymerase gene was described 
to localize to mitochondria consistent with its proapoptotic function. However,
PB1-F2 is also found diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus
suggesting additional functions of the protein. Here we show that PB1-F2
colocalizes and directly interacts with the viral PB1 polymerase protein. Lack of
PB1-F2 during infection resulted in an altered localization of PB1 and decreased 
viral polymerase activity. Consequently, mutant viruses devoid of a functional
PB1-F2 reading frame exhibited a small plaque phenotype. Thus, we have identified
a novel function of PB1-F2 as an indirect regulator of the influenza virus
polymerase activity via its interaction with PB1.
