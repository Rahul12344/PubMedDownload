Arboviral diseases are a major threat to human and animal health today. Analysis 
of whole-genome sequences of decades-old arboviral strains may bring new insights
into the viral evolution that might have facilitated outbreaks. Here, we report
the whole-genome sequences of two Middelburg viruses isolated several decades ago
in the Central African Republic.
