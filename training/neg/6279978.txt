The influence of polyamines on various enzymes involved in the excision repair
pathway of DNA, such as UV endonuclease, DNA polymerase I, DNA ligase and
polynucleotide kinase, and two AP-endonucleases, were studied. The polymerizing
activities of DNA polymerase I and polynucleotide kinase were found to be
markedly affected by polyamines. In the former enzyme the effect can be
attributed to the stabilization of the correct bihelical structure at the 3' end 
and in the latter case polyamines stabilize the polynucleotide kinase protein
itself in the correct oligomeric structure. The effect of polyamines on the
hydrolysis of apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in DNA and nucleosome particles
were also investigated. Spermine and spermidine were found to be the most
efficient polyamines in causing such hydrolysis both in the free DNA and in the
nucleosome particles.
