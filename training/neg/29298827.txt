BACKGROUND: Although neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a potentially
devastating infection requiring prompt evaluation and treatment, large-scale
assessments of the frequency in potentially infected infants have not been
performed.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of infants ≤60 days
old who had cerebrospinal fluid culture testing performed in 1 of 23
participating North American emergency departments. HSV infection was defined by 
a positive HSV polymerase chain reaction or viral culture. The primary outcome
was the proportion of encounters in which HSV infection was identified. Secondary
outcomes included frequency of central nervous system (CNS) and disseminated HSV,
and HSV testing and treatment patterns.
RESULTS: Of 26 533 eligible encounters, 112 infants had HSV identified (0.42%,
95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.35%-0.51%). Of these, 90 (80.4%) occurred in
weeks 1 to 4, 10 (8.9%) in weeks 5 to 6, and 12 (10.7%) in weeks 7 to 9. The
median age of HSV-infected infants was 14 days (interquartile range: 9-24 days). 
HSV infection was more common in 0 to 28-day-old infants compared with 29- to
60-day-old infants (odds ratio 3.9; 95% CI: 2.4-6.2). Sixty-eight (0.26%, 95% CI:
0.21%-0.33%) had CNS or disseminated HSV. The proportion of infants tested for
HSV (35%; range 14%-72%) and to whom acyclovir was administered (23%; range
4%-53%) varied widely across sites.
CONCLUSIONS: An HSV infection was uncommon in young infants evaluated for CNS
infection, particularly in the second month of life. Evidence-based approaches to
the evaluation for HSV in young infants are needed.
