[Clinicomorphological correlations in idiopathic and immunosuppressive forms of
Kaposi's sarcoma].

[Article in Russian]

Kazantseva IA, Molochkov AV.

Clinicomorphological correlations are presented for 136 patients with idiopathic 
and immunosuppressive types of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) with spot, plaque and tumour
manifestations. Early symptoms of KS (spot stage) as well as regressed and
angiomatous elements are difficult for pathomorphological diagnosis which should 
be performed regarding clinico-anamnestic data. The help in the diagnosis may be 
observation of DNA HHV-8 sequenses in PCR from tissue biopsies and positive
immunohistochemical reaction of endotheliocytes and fusiform tumour cell to CD34.
