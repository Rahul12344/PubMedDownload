A novel double-antigen sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was
developed to measure rabies antibodies in dogs. In contrast to the 4 days
required for detecting rabies antibody with conventional rabies antibody virus
neutralization assays, this ELISA can be completed in hours, without using live
virus, in routine laboratories.
