Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigen has been detected by antigen capture
enzyme linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA) in dry specimens of the mosquito Culex
tritaeniorhynchus Giles, 1901, collected from Karnal district of Haryana state in
northern India. These mosquitoes were stored in dry condition for 20 months, at
room temperature, before processing. The procedure of detecting JEV infection in 
long time stored, dry vector mosquitoes, has important application in the
surveillance of Japanese encephalitis.
