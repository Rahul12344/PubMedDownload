In most underdeveloped countries, the initial contact with Epstein Barr virus
(EBV) usually happens in the first decade of life and results in an asymptomatic 
infection, whereas in developed areas, primary infection in adolescence or
adulthood is accompanied by infectious mononucleosis in 50% cases. Although it is
generally a harmless passenger, in some individuals, it is associated with B-cell
lymphoma. In Argentina, EBV primary infection shows the classical pattern
observed in developing populations, given that nearly 70% of patients are
seropositive by the age of 2 years. However, EBV association with pediatric
Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma resembles that observed in developed regions.
Concerning diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, our series demonstrated higher EBV
association than other adult ones from either developed or underdeveloped
countries. Interestingly, the early EBV primary infection observed,
characteristic of an underdeveloped population, together with the statistically
significant EBV association with patients ≤ 10 years old demonstrated in all
types of lymphoma studied, suggest a relationship between low age of EBV
seroconversion and B-cell lymphoma development risk.
