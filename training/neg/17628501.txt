Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), members of the TGF-beta superfamily, have
been implicated in nervous system development and in response to injury. Previous
studies have shown that recombinant BMP7 can enhance dendritic growth and protect
cultured neurons from oxidative stress. Because of the presence of extracellular 
BMP antagonists, BMP7 seems to act locally. Therefore, the present study uses
BMP7 overexpression using adenovirus (Ad)-mediated gene transfer to examine its
effect in mixed neuronal cultures. Enhanced BMP7 expression selectively induces
neuronal CGRP expression in a time-dependent manner. BMP7 overexpression not only
significantly protects cultures from H2O2 toxicity but reduces lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) stimulation. Concurrently, it profoundly reduces microglial numbers, but
increases oligodendroglial and endothelial cells. Together, low-dose and
continuously expressed BMP7 is both neuroprotective and
differentiation-inductive.
