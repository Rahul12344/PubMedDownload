The morphological changes in platelets in acute and subacute African swine fever 
(ASF) and their relationship to pathogenesis were studied. Eight pigs were
inoculated with a highly virulent strain of African swine fever (Malawi '83) and 
14 with a moderately virulent strain (Dominican Republic '78) for ultrastructural
study of platelets, monocyte/macrophages and vascular structures in the liver,
spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, lung and kidney. Both viruses produced
activation and degranulation of platelets from day 3 after inoculation onwards,
coinciding with activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system and virus
replication in monocyte/macrophages. Platelet aggregation and viscous
metamorphosis of platelets were observed at 5 and 7 days after inoculation with
the highly virulent strain, coinciding with endothelial alterations, but platelet
aggregation was less prevalent and there was no sign of viscous metamorphosis in 
animals inoculated with the moderately virulent strain. Virions within platelets 
were observed at the final stage of acute ASF and at 5-7 days after inoculation
in subacute ASF. This suggests that platelets assist in disseminating ASF virus
within the body, especially in subacute infections.
