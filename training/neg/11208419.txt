Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) has been proposed as a candidate receptor
for hepatitis C virus (HCV). According to previous reports, free
beta-lipoproteins in a human serum may regulate the rate of hepatocyte infection 
by competing with the virus. Therefore, serum HCV levels should be regulated by
the rise and fall of serum beta-lipoproteins since the infection rate of virions 
influences HCV replication in hepatocytes and release of virions by hepatocytes. 
In this study, we examined the relationship between serum beta-lipoproteins and
HCV-antigen (Ag) levels in patients with chronic type C hepatitis. Patients were 
selected based on strict criteria to eliminate other factors that might influence
serum HCV levels. Serum concentrations of beta-lipoproteins and HCV-Ag were
measured two or more times within 3 months for each patient. The result showed
that HCV-Ag levels were negatively correlated with the increased
beta-lipoproteins. The results support the concept that LDLR is a HCV receptor
and that beta-lipoproteins competitively inhibit the infection of hepatocytes
with HCV through the LDLR.
