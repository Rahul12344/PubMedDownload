Passive hyperimmune therapy: a viable treatment option for the patient with
acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

Raven NC.

New drugs and therapies are continually emerging in an effort to delay the
progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive status to acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). One such treatment is passive hyperimmune
therapy (PHT), which was first researched and subsequently published in 1988.
Passive hyperimmune therapy involves plasmapheresis of an asymptomatic
HIV-positive donor with high p24 antibodies, no detectable p24 antigen, and a
helper-inducer T-cell count greater than 400. The plasma is then pooled,
sterilized, and administered to symptomatic HIV-positive patients as a monthly
intravenous infusion in an effort to provide passive immunotherapy. In this
article, an overview of PHT is provided, including benefits, adverse reactions,
and other similar therapies available, so that the nurse who cares for
HIV-positive patients can continue to be a significant source of information to
them.
