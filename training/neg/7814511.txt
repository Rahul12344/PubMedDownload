Two group A rotavirus strains isolated from diarrheic foals in Venezuela were
classified as belonging to G14 serotype by cross-neutralization tests and on the 
basis of the homology of the sequenced VP7 gene. This report confirms that
rotavirus strains of G14 serotype specificity circulate among equine populations.
