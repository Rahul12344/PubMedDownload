Herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1), type 2(HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus
(VZV) belong to alphaherpesvirus family. These herpesviruses have large DNA
genomes which contain at least 69 genes. These viral genes are divided into two
groups based on whether they are essential or dispensable for virus growth in
cell culture. The essential gene products include transcriptional factor, viral
DNA replication, DNA cleavage/packaging and virion components, while the
dispensable gene products include deoxyribonucleotides metabolism, protein
kinases, tegument proteins. This article briefly reviews the functions of
alphaherpesvirus gene products, particularly roles of viral encoded protein
kinases, tegument proteins and host immune evasion.
