BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) are a group of regulatory RNAs that regulate gene 
expression by binding to specific sequences on target mRNAs. However, functional 
identification of mRNA targets is usually difficult and time consuming. Here we
report hybrid-PCR as a new and rapid approach to screen putative mRNA targets in 
vitro.
RESULTS: Fifteen putative target mRNAs for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
miR-UL112-1, including previously confirmed HCMV IE72, were identified from
mRNA-derived cDNAs using hybrid-PCR. Moreover, we randomly validated six
different target candidates by luciferase reporter assays, and confirmed that
their luciferase activities were down-regulated with co-transfection of HCMV
miR-UL112-1.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that hybrid-PCR is an effective and rapid
approach for screening putative miRNA targets, with much more advantage of
simplicity, low cost, and ease of implementation.
