The expanding epidemic of HIV infection in reproductive-age women, the
availability of antiretroviral therapy for children, and recommendations for
increased case identification activities augur a time when more and more
pediatricians are going to be called on to care for HIV-exposed infants. This
article outlines a comprehensive medical framework for the care of these children
from the labor and delivery setting to the nursery, outpatient clinic, and the
emergency room. It includes issues of infection control; medical, developmental, 
and psychosocial care; and laboratory evaluations. Finally, it address the need
for long-term follow-up of all children born exposed to HIV.
