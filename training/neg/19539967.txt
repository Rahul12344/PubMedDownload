The membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of gp41 is considered as a prime
target for the induction of neutralizing antibodies, since it contains the
epitopes for three broadly neutralizing antibodies (2F5, 4E10 and Z13). Here we
present a novel gp41 construct (HA-gp41) comprising gp41 HR2 and MPER fused to
two triple-stranded coiled-coil domains at both ends. HA-gp41 is trimeric, has a 
high helical content in solution and forms rod-like structures as revealed by
negative staining electron microscopy. Immunization of rabbits with HA-gp41
induced antibodies directed against MPER, which failed to exert significant
neutralization capacity against envelopes from primary isolates. Thus
trimerisation of MPER regions does not suffice to induce a potent neutralizing
antibody response specific for conserved regions within gp41.
