Lipoid pneumonia usually presents after chronic recurrent ingestion of oily
substances or accidental aspiration during "fire-eating" demonstrations. Massive 
exposure by near drowning extremely rare and potentially fatal. We present here a
case of survival after total immersion in oil in her workplace. A 66-year-old
woman who nearly drowned in a vat of vegetable oil was admitted as an emergency
case with severe hypoxia after rescue. Chest computed tomography (CT) findings
showed bilateral ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and the case fulfilled the 
criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bronchoscopy and
bronchoalveolar lavage performed on admission indicated oil droplets and marked
neutrophilia (67%), which made us diagnose ARDS induced by lipoid pneumonia. We
commenced treatment with pulsed steroids and strictly managed fluid balance under
mechanical ventilation. Despite immediate improvement in oxygenation, the value
of extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) measured by the PiCCO system
consistently remained over 30 ml/Kg through her clinical course. We concluded
that lipoid pneumonia is characterized by prolonged elevatation of pulmonary
vascular permeability.
