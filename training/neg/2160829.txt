A method for screening recombinant lambda libraries was devised to select phage
containing genomic regions containing provirus insertions of retroviruses that
carry the kanamycin and G418 resistance factor neo and the origin of replication 
derived from pBR322 (oripBR). Such recombinants are phagemids, able to replicate 
as bacteriophages or as plasmids under lambda repressor control. lambda repressor
was cloned into a plasmid derived from pSC101 that is compatible with
pBR322-derived phagemids. A strain carrying this plasmid may be used to select
phagemids derived from a single proviral insertion with 100% efficiency from
complex recombinant libraries. Homologous recombination between proviral long
terminal repeats was observed at a rate of 10(-4)/plaque-forming unit in recABC+ 
strains. Despite this frequency, intact phagemids are easily recovered as phage
after temperature shift to 42 degrees C. Since oripBR itself is a selectable
marker in this system, the method could be applied to recover any sequence
carrying the ori sequence from pBR322.
