A series of shuttle vectors has been constructed, which consist of a plasmid
carrying a polylinker sequence and an M13 origin integrated into a lambda vector.
A short direct repeat flanking the plasmid allows plasmid excision by homologous 
recombination. Sequences are cloned into unique restriction sites within the
plasmid, and can be recovered either in phage or plasmid form, or can be packaged
further as single-stranded DNA phage. These vectors therefore combine the
efficiency of phage lambda cloning and screening with the ease of handling or
analysing plasmid or M13 clones.
