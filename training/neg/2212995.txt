This communication reports the physical map of mycoplasma virus L3 (MV-L3) DNA
derived from restriction patterns obtained by digestion with seven different
restriction endonucleases. The length of the restriction map is 36,200 bp in
contrast to the contour length of native MV-L3 DNA molecules which is 39,400 bp
as determined by electron microscopy. The difference in length of 3,200 bp
(corresponding to 8.1% of the native viral DNA contour length) is explained by
terminal redundancy. It was possible to clone all fragments from particular
restriction patterns into Escherichia coli vector pAT153, an indication of
circular permutation within a population of MV-L3 DNA. However clear evidence has
been obtained from the molar ratios of fragments and from hybridization
experiments. We suppose that viral DNA is packaged from a concatemeric precursor 
molecule starting at a specific site called pac.
