We report the adaptation of dendrimer-based nonviral expression system for
ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) overproduction in human mesenchymal stem cells
(hMSCs) embedded into fibrin-based three-dimensional (3D) matrix. Time-restricted
neurotrophin expression enables autologous adult stem cells for additional
trophic support and increases their therapeutic potential in neuroregeneration
applications. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM)-NH(2) dendrimers of fourth generation
effectively provided virus-free delivery and expression of CNTF-internal ribosome
entry site-green fluorescent protein cassette with a transfection efficiency in
hMSCs over 11%. CNTF levels in transfected cultures were 10-fold higher as
compared with the control cells. Dendrimer-driven CNTF expression also persisted 
in hMSCs embedded into fibrin-based 3D matrix, an emerging vehicle for cell
delivery or bioartificial organ formation. Nonviral modification of autologous
adult stem cells with use of dendrimers is a novel tool perspective in terms of
biosafety and technological availability.
