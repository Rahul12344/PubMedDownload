Two human immunodeficiency virus seropositive patients with progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) exhibited a dramatic though incomplete
recovery of neurologic function and have survived for more than 30 months since
the onset of symptoms. PML was the initial manifestation of the acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in both patients, though other opportunistic
infections have subsequently supervened in one. Brain tissue from both patients
obtained by stereotactic biopsy showed the typical features of PML, but was also 
characterized by an unusually prominent inflammatory response. Neurologic
improvement did not appear to correlate with clinical or laboratory measurements 
of immunologic improvement. One patient continued to display neurologic recovery 
despite the development of other opportunistic infections. Though atypical, PML
in AIDS may be associated with prolonged survival.
