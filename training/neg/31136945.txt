Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-activation has been implicated as a significant
mechanism of neuroinflammation triggered by ssRNA viruses. Infiltration of
monocytes into the brain and astrocyte activation occurs during in vivo
TLR7-mediated neuroinflammation. The objective here was to determine whether the 
TLR7 agonist, imiquimod, and interferon-alpha (IFN-α), promote monocyte-mediated 
astrocyte secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Using a human primary co-culture
system, we demonstrate that monocytes, together with imiquimod and IFN-α, promote
astrocyte secretion of MCP-1, IL-6 and IP-10. Furthermore, TLR7-induced
monocyte-derived IL-1β is critical for promoting the astrocyte response. Overall,
this study provides a potential mechanism for TLR7-mediated neuroinflammation.
