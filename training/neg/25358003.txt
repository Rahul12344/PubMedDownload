Part of the G protein (3094-4170 bp) of spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) was
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by dialysis in our study. Two clones
of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs 1H11 and 4B8) against G protein were generated by 
fusion of mouse myeloma cell line SP2/0 and spleen lymphocytes from part of G
protein (3094-4170 bp) immunized mice. The results of ELISA (enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay), IFA (indirect immunofluorescent assay), and Western blot
assay further demonstrated the characterizations of the two MAbs. Both 1H11 and
4B8 were specific to SVCV G protein. Ten pairs of synthesized overlapping
peptides were used to identify the epitope of the MAbs. The MAbs are useful in
the development of SVCV diagnostic methods.
