BA is a rare disease of unclear etiology; nevertheless, its impact in the field
of pediatric hepatology is significant. It is the most common surgically
correctable cause of neonatal cholestasis and is the most common pediatric
disease referred for liver transplantation. Little progress has been made with
regard to improving outcome or understanding its pathogenesis in the past decade.
Fortunately, however, a national, government-sponsored collaborative endeavor has
begun that will hopefully make a significant impact upon the progress of
designing new treatments for BA and develop a better understanding of its
pathogenesis.
