Many treatment complications that occur late in childhood cancer survivors
resemble age-related comorbidities observed in the elderly. An immune phenotype
characterized by increased immune activation, systemic inflammation, and
accumulation of late-differentiated memory CD57(+) CD28(-) T cells has been
associated with comorbidities in the elderly. Here, we explored if this phenotype
was present in young adult leukemia survivors following an average of 19 years
from chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy completion, and compared this with that in 
age-matched controls. We found that markers of systemic inflammation-IL-6 and
human C-reactive protein and immune activation-CD38 and HLA-DR on T cells,
soluble CD (sCD)163 from monocytes and macrophages-were increased in survivors
compared to controls. T-cell responses specific to cytomegalovirus (CMV) were
also increased in survivors compared to controls while CMV IgG levels in
survivors were comparable to levels measured in the elderly (>50years) and
correlated with IL-6, human C-reactive protein, sCD163, and CD57(+) CD28(-)
memory T cells. Immune activation and inflammation markers correlated poorly with
prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy exposure. These data suggest that CMV
infection/reactivation is strongly correlated with the immunological phenotype
seen in young childhood leukemia survivors and these changes may be associated
with the early onset of age-related comorbidities in this group.
