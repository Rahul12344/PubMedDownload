MrfA, a transcription factor that regulates Dictyostelium prestalk cell
differentiation, is an orthologue of the metazoan myelin gene regulatory factor
(MRF) proteins. We show that the MRFs contain a predicted transmembrane domain,
suggesting that they are synthesised as membrane-tethered proteins that are then 
proteolytically released. We confirm this for MrfA but report a radically
different mode of processing from that of paradigmatic tethered transcriptional
regulators, which are cleaved within the transmembrane domain by a dedicated
protease. Instead, an auto-proteolytic cleavage mechanism, previously only
described for the intramolecular chaperone domains of bacteriophage tail-spike
proteins, processes MrfA and, by implication, the metazoan MRF proteins. We also 
present evidence that the auto-proteolysis of MrfA occurs rapidly and
constitutively in the ER and that its specific role in prestalk cell
differentiation is conferred by the regulated nuclear translocation of the
liberated fragment.
