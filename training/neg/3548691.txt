Two types of Newcastle disease viruses isolated from feral birds in western
Australia detected by monoclonal antibodies.

Alexander DJ, Mackenzie JS, Russell PH.

Thirteen viruses isolated from feral birds and one isolated from a domestic duck,
obtained in 1979-1980 during a survey of birds in Western Australia, were shown
to be Newcastle disease viruses of low virulence for chickens. The binding of
mouse monoclonal antibodies, raised against NDV-Ulster 2C to MDBK cells infected 
with the isolates was assessed using an indirect immunoperoxidase test. Five
viruses caused binding of all 9 monoclonal antibodies tested, whereas the other 9
isolates induced binding of only 4 monoclonal antibodies.
