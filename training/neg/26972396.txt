OBJECTIVE: To identify the circulating serotypes of human echovirus in Malaysia
from 2002 to 2013.
METHODS: A total of 31 retrospective samples from non-polio acute flacid
paralysis, hand-food-and-mouth disease, viral meningitis and enterovirus cases
were subjected to amplification of partial VP1 gene by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the partial sequences identified
presence of human echovirus and human coxsackie viruses. It was found that
echovirus 11 was the commonly circulating serotype followed by echovirus 6,
echovirus 7, echovirus 3, echovirus 9, echovirus 30 and echovirus 1 in decreasing
order. Additionally two types of human coxsackie virus isolates were detected
which were coxsackie A24 and B3.
CONCLUSIONS: From the findings, there is a possibility that echovirus 11 is the
predominant serotype among Malaysian patients with echovirus infection. However, 
a larger sample size will yield a more confident result to support this evidence.
