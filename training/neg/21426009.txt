Several glycoprocessing enzymes and glycoreceptors have been recognized as
important targets for therapeutic intervention. This concept has inspired the
development of important classes of therapeutics, such as anti-influenza drugs
inhibiting influenza virus neuraminidase, anti-inflammatory drugs targeting
lectin-sialyl-Lewis X interaction and glycosidase inhibitors against HIV,
Gaucher's disease, hepatitis and cancer. These therapeutics are mainly
carbohydrate mimics in which proper modifications permit stronger interactions
with the target protein, higher stability, better pharmacokinetic properties and 
easier synthesis. Furthermore, the conformational rigidity and polyfunctionality 
of carbohydrates stimulate their use as scaffolds for the generation of libraries
by combinatorial decoration with different pharmacophores. This mini-review will 
present examples of how to exploit carbohydrates mimics and scaffolds in drug
research.
