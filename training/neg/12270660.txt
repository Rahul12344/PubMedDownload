A competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
developed to detect and to quantitate the RNA of group A rotaviruses. In the
assay, a 433 bp fragment is amplified by a one-tube RT-PCR protocol using primers
with binding sites located in a highly conserved region of segment 6 of the
rotavirus genome. An in vitro synthesized RNA with a 43-base deletion with
respect to the wild-type sequence of this fragment was used as an internal
control. Using these transcripts as templates, 10 RNA molecules were amplified
reproducibly and detected in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels or by
fluorimetry using the SYBR Green I dye in a real-time RT-PCR assay. The
efficiency of the protocol was confirmed by the detection of small amounts of
viral RNA of group A rotaviruses in clinical samples obtained from various animal
species and man.
