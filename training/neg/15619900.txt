We set up a competitive PCR assay to obtain simultaneously a quantitative
estimation of HBV wild type (M0) and precore mutant (M1 M2) genomes in sera of
patients with HBeAg negative chronic hepatitis B and their evolution during
antiviral therapy. The results showed that the amount of HBV DNA declined to
undetectable levels very rapidly after the beginning of therapy in responders,
while in non responders, the amount of viral genomes decreased but without
becoming negative. Wild type viral strains (M0) seemed to be more sensitive to
interferon as compared to precore mutant strains (M2). This method may be useful 
to study the course of viral infection and to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral 
therapy.
