An outbreak of gastroenteritis followed a meal in a large hotel during which one 
of the diners vomited. The clinical features of the illness suggested
Norwalk-like virus (NLV, small round structured virus) infection, and this was
confirmed by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) of stool samples. Further characterization of the virus by
nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons revealed identical strains in
all the affected individuals. The foods served at the meal could not be
demonstrated to be the cause of the outbreak. Analysis of attack rates by dining 
table showed an inverse relationship with the distance from the person who
vomited. No one eating in a separate restaurant reported illness. Transmission
from person-to-person or direct contamination of food seems unlikely in this
outbreak. However, the findings are consistent with airborne spread of NLV with
infection by inhalation with subsequent ingestion of virus particles.
