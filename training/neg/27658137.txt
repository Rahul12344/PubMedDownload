Seroprotection status of hepatitis B and measles vaccines in children with type 1
diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is speculated to have an impaired
immunological response to vaccines. This paper aimed to investigate the presence 
of specific antibodies against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and measles in diabetic
children who had been immunized according to the standard national calendar of
immunization.
METHODS: Two hundred and one diabetic children and 140 healthy controls were
prospectively evaluated. Antibodies against hepatitis B (anti-HBs) and measles
were detected in all individuals who completed the vaccination schedule. We noted
onset of T1DM, duration of the disease, diabetes-related autoantibodies and mean 
HbA1c levels.
RESULTS: Some 72.6% of diabetics and 82.1% of controls had anti-HBs (+) (p=0.04).
We found a reduced efficacy of measles vaccination in anti-HBs (-) diabetic
children (p=0.009), even though there was no significant difference between the
study and control groups. Onset of the disease was earlier in anti-HBs (-)
diabetics than in controls (p=0.038). No difference with respect to other
parameters was found.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed a reduced seroprotection rate for HBV vaccination in
diabetic children and for measles with anti-HBs (-) diabetics. Larger studies
should be encouraged to confirm the vaccine efficacy in diabetic children and to 
elucidate possible pathogenic mechanisms.
