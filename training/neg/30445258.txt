CD40 is a crucial signal mediating factor in T-dependent B cell responses and
involved in many aspects of cellular and humoral immunity. In this paper,
recombinant protein of CD40 in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) and its
antibodies (Abs) were produced, native CD40 molecules in flounder tissues were
identified, then the CD40+ leukocytes in T/B lymphocytes were characterized, and 
the variations of CD40+ leukocytes in flounder after Hirame novirhabdovirus
(HIRRV) infection and immunization were investigated, respectively. The results
showed that the Abs could specifically recognize native flounder CD40 molecule at
32 kDa. The proportions of CD40+ leukocytes were varied by flounder tissues.
CD40+/IgM+ B lymphocytes, CD40+/CD4-1+ T lymphocytes, CD40+/CD4-2+ T lymphocytes 
and CD40+/CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were
1.18 ± 0.27%, 0.69 ± 0.17%, 0.75 ± 0.14% and 0.25 ± 0.14%; were 2.80 ± 0.32%,
0.71 ± 0.19%, 0.88 ± 0.23% and 0.33 ± 0.17% in spleen; 4.11 ± 0.47%,
0.92 ± 0.18%, 1.09 ± 0.17% and 0.9 ± 0.17% in head kidney; 1.92 ± 0.39%,
1.02 ± 0.23%, 1.33 ± 0.38% and 0.67 ± 0.24% in intestine; 1.24 ± 0.36%,
1.21 ± 0.24%, 1.70 ± 0.3% and 0.97 ± 0.21% in gill, respectively. The percentages
of CD40+ leukocytes in PBLs were significantly increased in both HIRRV infection 
and immunization groups, and reached their peak levels at 3rd day with
5.70 ± 0.16% and 6.40 ± 0.13%, respectively. Concluded with our previous study,
these data first reported that CD40 molecules were expressed on both B and T
lymphocytes in teleost, and had a coordination with T and B lymphocytes in immune
responses.
