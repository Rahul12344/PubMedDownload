All herpes simplex virus (HSV) infected cell-specific polypeptides (ICSPs) were
synthesized in the presence of lithium at a concentration (60 mM) inhibitory to
the production of infectious virus. Yields of certain ICSPs were increased and
others, in particular glycoprotein C, decreased. HSV DNA synthesis was completely
inhibited; synthesis and in vitro activities of HSV DNA polymerase and thymidine 
kinase were decreased but to a degree insufficient to account for the complete
inhibition of HSV DNA synthesis. HSV DNA synthesis was inhibited to an equivalent
degree by either incubation with 60 mM-lithium or by potassium starvation; both
procedures decreased intracellular potassium by an equivalent amount as adjudged 
by X-ray microanalysis. We conclude that lithium inhibits HSV DNA synthesis by
displacement of potassium from a potassium-dependent biochemical reaction or by
other physiological changes brought about by the loss of cellular potassium. The 
possibility that lithium also directly inhibits a virus replicative event cannot 
be excluded.
