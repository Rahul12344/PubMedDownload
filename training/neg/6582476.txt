A molecular approach to leukemogenesis: mouse lymphomas contain an activated
c-ras oncogene.

Guerrero I, Calzada P, Mayer A, Pellicer A.

By inducing mouse thymomas with carcinogens and gamma-radiation, we have studied 
the potential of tumor DNA to induce foci in rodent fibroblasts. A high
percentage of the tumors used transformed the cultured cells, and the oncogenic
phenotype segregated with extra copies of the c-ras gene family. There appears to
be selectivity in the activated gene because so far all analyzed tumors induced
by carcinogen have activated the N-ras gene, and those induced by radiation have 
activated the K-ras gene. The K-ras gene is the cellular counterpart of the viral
ras oncogene in Kirsten murine sarcoma virus, but the N-ras has not yet been
found in a retrovirus. The transformed cells have a marked increase in expression
of the oncogene at the RNA and protein level. This model system might be a
powerful tool in the study of leukemogenesis.
