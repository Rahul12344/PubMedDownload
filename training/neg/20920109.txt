OBJECTIVE: Estimating the prevalence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
in generally low-prevalence populations containing communities with a higher
disease burden is difficult. This study was conducted to estimate the prevalence 
of serological markers of infection with, and immunity to, HBV in the Victorian
population and to analyse trends in these estimates over time.
METHODS: A serological survey of 3,212 samples of convenience collected in the
years 1995, 2000 and 2005 was conducted using a selection procedure designed to
reduce selection bias. All samples were tested for hepatitis B surface and core
antibodies; all core antibody positive samples (indicating previous infection)
were then tested for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
RESULTS: HBsAg prevalence was 1.1% (95%CI 0.8-1.6%) with significant differences 
observed by area of residence, age, gender and test year. Serological evidence of
immunisation in infants and adolescents were lower than established estimates
following the introduction of universal vaccination for these groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasises the significant and growing problem of chronic
HBV infection in Victoria and suggests lower than expected population immunity
deriving from universal vaccination programs.
IMPLICATIONS: Greater efforts are needed to formulate a comprehensive public
health response to address this relatively neglected blood borne viral infection,
the burden of which is very significant in some marginalised sections of our
community. Increased attention to improving the universality of our immunisation 
programs is also needed.
