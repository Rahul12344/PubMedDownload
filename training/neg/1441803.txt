[The biological properties of Serratia marcescens bacteriophages].

[Article in Russian]

Gabrilovich IM, GaÄ­rabekov RKh.

Sixteen phages active against bacteria of the genus Serratia have been divided
into 4 groups on the basis of the study of their biological properties. As a
result, 5 typing phages have been selected, which permitted the typing of 77.3%
of S. marcescens cultures under study, divided into 13 phage types.
