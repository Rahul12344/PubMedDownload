Liposomes, artificial membrane vesicles, are being intensively studied for their 
usefulness as delivery vehicles in vitro and in vivo. Substantial progress has
been made in the development of procedures for liposome preparation, targeting
and delivery of contents. The broad flexibility now available in the design of
the structure and composition of liposomes, coupled to recent reports of liposome
mediated gene transfer in animals, suggest that liposome technology is now poised
to be utilized in the creation of custom-designed cell-type-specific gene
transfer vehicles.
