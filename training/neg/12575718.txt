Nucleic acids (combined with protein molecules) are essential constituents of the
living systems playing an important role in the early evolution of life as well. 
A specific feature of these molecules has been found and directly confirmed
recently: under the influence of short-wavelength UV radiation bipyrimidine
photoproducts (cyclobutane dimers and 6-4 bipyrimidines) are induced and the
reversion of them can be provoked by the same photons. However, reversion is
preferred by the shorter wavelengths. With increasing ratio of the longer
wavelength components of the radiation (using artificial UV sources and solar
light on the Earth's surface) the impact of the reversible photoproducts in the
harmful biological effect decreases and other photoproducts are dominant.
Assuming the photoinduced reactions (dimerisation and reversion) are statistical 
events, during the irradiation the chance for a number of nucleoprotein molecules
to survive the radiation damage can be reality. The theoretical and experimental 
basis of these assumptions will be discussed in the case of bacteriophage T7
nucleoprotein.
