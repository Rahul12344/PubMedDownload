An automated RNA isolation procedure on the Qiagen BioRobot is described for
performing viral load tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with the
Amplicor HIV type 1 test. The new procedure improves the precision of the assay
and requires significantly less labor than the presently used manual RNA
isolation procedure.
