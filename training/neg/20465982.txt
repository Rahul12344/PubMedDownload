BACKGROUND: Dental dams have been distributed to women prisoners for protection
against HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STIs) in some Canadian
and Australian prisons for over a decade. However, we do not know whether they
serve any useful public health purpose.
OBJECTIVE: To determine how dental dams are used in women's prisons in New South 
Wales (NSW), Australia.
METHOD: Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we investigated women's
sexual practices with a focus on how dental dams are used in NSW prisons.
RESULTS: Although 71 of the 199 (36%) women reported having had sex with another 
inmate, with oral sex involved in most encounters, only eight (4%) had ever used 
a dental dam. The main sources of STI transmission risk among women prisoners
were oral sex, manual sex and sharing dildos. Furthermore, sharing razors could
also allow the transmission of blood-borne viruses, which could occur during sex 
in the presence of cuts or menstrual fluid. The high rates of hepatitis B and C
among incarcerated women compound this risk.
CONCLUSION: Dental dams are not widely used by women prisoners and we question
their utility in women's prisons. Oral sex is an important risk factor for
acquisition of herpes simplex virus type 1, but most women in NSW prisons (89%)
are already infected. Condoms and latex gloves may have more use. Condoms could
be used as a barrier on shared dildos and sex toys, while latex gloves could be
used to protect cut and grazed hands from vaginal and menstrual fluids.
