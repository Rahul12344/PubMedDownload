A crucial step in the arenavirus life cycle is the proteolytic processing of the 
viral envelope glycoprotein precursor (GPC) by the cellular proprotein convertase
(PC) subtilisin kexin isozyme-1 (SKI-1)/site-1 protease (S1P). Here we conducted 
a systematic and quantitative analysis of SKI-1/S1P processing of peptides
derived from the recognition sites of GPCs of different Old World and New World
arenaviruses. We found that SKI-1/S1P showed a strong preference for arenaviral
sequences resembling its autoprocessing sites, which are recurrent motifs in
arenaviral GPCs. The African arenaviruses Lassa, Mobala, and Mopeia resemble the 
SKI-1/S1P autoprocessing C-site, whereas sequences derived from Clade B New World
viruses Junin and Tacaribe have similarities to the autoprocessing B-site. In
contrast, analogous peptides derived from cellular SKI-1/S1P substrates were
remarkably poor substrates. The data suggest that arenavirus GPCs evolved to
mimic SKI-1/S1P autoprocessing sites, likely ensuring efficient cleavage and
perhaps avoiding competition with SKI-1/S1P's cellular substrates.
