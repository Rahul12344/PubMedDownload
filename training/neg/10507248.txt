Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In 1988, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to eradicate
poliomyelitis globally by 2000. During the same year, the Regional Committee,
Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) of the World Health Organization (WHO)
resolved to eradicate polio from the region by 2000. Substantial progress in
reaching this goal has been made globally and in countries of EMR. This report
describes the current status of polio eradication in Afghanistan, a country in
EMR with ongoing civil conflict where eradication efforts began in late 1994.
