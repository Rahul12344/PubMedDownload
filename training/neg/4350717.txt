Avian oncornavirus group-specific antigen: detection and quantification by
radioimmunoassay.

Fritz RB, Qualtiere LF.

A double-antibody competitive-inhibition radioimmunoassay for avian
group-specific antigen is described. A viral protein preparation, consisting
primarily of gs-1, was labeled with radioiodine. Hamster and rabbit antisera were
reacted with the labeled antigen, and the resultant antibody-antigen complexes
were precipitated with the appropriate antiglobulin. Standard curves based on the
inhibition of binding of labeled antigen to antibody after preincubation with
unlabeled antigen were prepared. These showed the lower limit of sensitivity to
be 2 to 10 ng of unlabeled protein when labeled antigen of 2,000 to 5,000 counts 
per min per ng of specific activity was used in the assay. Extracts of avian
oncornavirus-infected cells, likewise, were able to inhibit binding of labeled
antigen. This technique will be very useful for the quantification of small
amounts of oncornavirus group-specific protein.
