A survey of isosteric replacements of the phosphonoalanine side chain coupled
with a process of conformational constraint of a bisbenzimidazole-based,
Zn(2+)-dependent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 serine protease
resulted in the identification of novel series of active compounds with extended 
side chains. However, Zn(2+)-dependent HCV NS3 inhibition was relatively
insensitive to the structural variations examined but dependent on the presence
of negatively charged functionality. This result was interpreted in the context
of an initial electrostatic interaction between protease and inhibitor that is
subsequently consolidated by Zn(2+), with binding facilitated by the featureless 
active site and proximal regions of the HCV NS3 protein.
