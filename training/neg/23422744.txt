Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) generated during the
course of HIV-1 infection is essential for effective HIV-1 vaccine design. The
magnitude and breadth of neutralizing activity in the sera from 46 antiretroviral
treatment-naive HIV-1 clade C-infected individuals was measured in a single round
infection assay using TZM-bl cells and multisubtype panel of env-pseudotyped
viruses. Higher levels of NAb response (NAb titer 500 to >40 000) were measured
in these patients against tier 1 and tier 2 viruses. The average magnitude of the
NAb responses of chronically infected individuals against heterologous viruses
was consistently higher than the response observed from individuals with
long-term nonprogressor ( P = .086). To conclude, high titers of HIV-1
cross-neutralizing activity were observed in the sera from a subset of
HIV-1-infected individuals in Chennai, India. Additional studies of the epitopes 
recognized by these antibodies may facilitate the discovery of an effective
vaccine immunogen.
