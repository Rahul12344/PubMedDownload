Primary structure of v-raf: relatedness to the src family of oncogenes.

Mark GE, Rapp UR.

A replication-defective, acute transforming retrovirus (murine sarcoma virus
3611) was isolated from mouse and molecularly cloned. The nucleotide sequence of 
1.5 kilobases encompassing the transforming gene (v-raf) was determined. This
sequence, which predicts the amino acid sequence of a gag-raf fusion protein,
terminates 180 nucleotides from the 3' end of the acquired cellular sequence.
Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of v-raf with the predicted amino
acid sequences of other oncogenes reveals significant homologies to the src
family of oncogenes. There is a lack of homology within the sequence of the
tyrosine acceptor domain described for the phosphotyrosine kinase members of the 
src family of transforming proteins. Phylogenetic arrangement of this family of
oncogenes suggests that tyrosine-specific phosphorylation may be a recently
acquired activity.
