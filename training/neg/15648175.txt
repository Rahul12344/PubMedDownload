Structural studies of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) have largely focused on
the mature viral particle, providing atomic resolution images of the spherical
protein capsid for a number of sero- and sub-types, structures of the highly
immunogenic surface loop, Fab and GAG receptor complexes. Additionally,
structures are available for a few non-structural proteins. The chapter reviews
our current structural knowledge and its impact on our understanding of the virus
life cycle proceeding from the mature virus through immune evasion/inactivation, 
cell-receptor binding and replication and alludes to future structural targets.
