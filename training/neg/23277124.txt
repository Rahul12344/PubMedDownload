A seven-year-old horse was euthanised after exhibiting a severe and rapidly
progressive neurological disorder. Tissue samples were despatched to the Italian 
Reference Centre for Animal Foreign Diseases (Istituto 'G. Caporale' in Teramo)
for diagnosis. All laboratory tests for equine neurotropic viruses gave negative 
results. Scattered perivascular inflammatory infiltrates and several parasites
that were morphologically classified as Halicephalobus gingivalis, were seen
within the brain upon microscopic examination. Pathological findings led to the
diagnosis of parasitic meningo-encephalitis caused by H. gingivalis. This case
report confirms that halicephalobosis should be taken into account in the
differential diagnosis of equine encephalopathy and it also highlights the value 
of a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving in veterinary medicine.
