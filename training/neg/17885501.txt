Long considered as ectopic breast tissue, anogenital mammary-like glands (MLGs)
have recently been suggested to represent distinctive structures located in the
anogenital area. We studied 16 neoplasms of anogenital MLG for human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using INNO-line probe assay (LiPA) HPV Genotyping kit,
GP5+/6+, CP(SGB), and FAP 6085-6319 primer sets. The lesions included 3
fibroadenomas, 2 adenosis tumors, 1 invasive ductal carcinoma, 1 tubulolobular
carcinoma, 2 hidradenoma papilliferum with prominent cystic change rendering a
cystadenoma appearance and oxyphilic metaplasia, and 7 cases of extramammary
Paget disease. All 3 fibroadenomas, both adenosis tumors, both hidradenoma
papilliferum, and the tubulolobular carcinoma proved negative for HPV DNA. HPV-31
was detected by LiPA in the case of invasive ductal carcinoma. In 2 of the 7
patients with extramammary Paget disease, there was HPV DNA present in the
lesional tissue, typed as HPV-6 (LiPA) and a type which was closely related to
HPV-21 and HPV-24 (FAP 6085-6319), whereas the remaining 5 cases tested negative.
These results coupled with those obtained from literature review suggest that HPV
plays no causative role in lesions of anogenital MLG.
