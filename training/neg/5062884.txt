Solid-phase radioimmunoassay of total and influenza-specific immunoglobulin G.

Daugharty H, Warfield DT, Davis ML.

An antigen-antibody system of polystyrene tubes coated with immunoglobulin
antibody was used for quantitating immunoglobulins. A similar radioimmunoassay
method was adapted for a viral antigen-antibody system. The viral system can be
used for quantitating viruses and for measuring virus-specific antibodies by
reacting with (125)iodine-labeled anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG). Optimal conditions
for coating the solid phase, specificity of the immune reaction, and other
kinetics and sensitivities of the assay method were investigated. Comparison of
direct and indirect methods of assaying for immunoglobulins or viral antibody
indicates that the indirect method is more sensitive and can quantitate a minimum
of 0.037 mug of IgG per ml. Results of solid-phase radioimmunoassay for influenza
antibody correlate well with hemagglutinin antibody titers but not with
complement-fixing antibody titers. Radioimmunoassay results for influenza
antibody by solid phase are likewise in agreement with results by the carrier
precipitate radioimmunoassay method. The simplicity, reproducibility, and
versatility of the solid-phase procedure make it diagnostically useful.
