Various assay methods have been developed to evaluate the effectiveness of
substances against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). One of them is the
Syncytia formation inhibition assay, which is based on the inhibition of the
interaction between the HIV-1 envelope protein gp 120 and the cellular membrane
protein CD4. A variation of this assay using recombinant virus vPE 16 and CD4(+) 
HeLa cell was developed to find anti-HIV compounds in natural products that
inhibit gp 120-CD4 binding. VPE 16 expresses glycoprotein gp 160, which is
glycosylated then processed into gp 120 and gp 41 on its envelope. A total of 50 
plant extracts were screened with this system. Extracts from Calicarpa japonica
and Sedum sarmentosum were among those that showed strong inhibition of the gp
120-CD4 interaction.
