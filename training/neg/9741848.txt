The crystal structures of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules complexed with antigenic peptides revealed a network of hydrogen bonds 
between the charged amino- and carboxyl-termini of the peptides and conserved MHC
residues at both ends of the peptide binding site. These interactions were shown 
to contribute substantially to the stability of class I MHC/peptide complexes by 
thermal denaturation studies using synthetic peptides in which either the amino- 
or carboxyl-terminal group is substituted by a methyl group. Here we report
crystal structures of HLA-A*0201 complexed with these terminally modified
synthetic peptides showing that they adopt the same bound conformation as
antigenic peptides. A number of variations in peptide conformation were observed 
for the terminally modified peptides, including in one case, a large
conformational difference in four central peptide residues that is apparently
caused by the lattice contact. This is reminiscent of the way binding a T-cell
receptor changed the conformation of central residues of an MHC-bound peptide.
The structures determined identify which conserved hydrogen bonds are eliminated 
in terminally substituted peptides and suggest an increased energetic importance 
of the interactions at the peptide termini for MHC-peptide stability.
