This case report describes a 32-year-old woman treated with indinavir who
developed mild to moderate flank pain, malaise, and low-grade fever. Sterile
pyuria preceded increased serum creatinine levels. Workup revealed persistent
pyuria, normal-sized kidneys, a normal intravenous pyelography, and negative
urinary cultures. Renal biopsy showed interstitial nephritis and chronic
inflammation. Collecting ducts contained crystals. Two months after treatment
with indinavir was discontinued, serum creatinine levels returned to normal and
pyuria disappeared. Sterile pyuria in patients taking indinavir may help to
identify patients at risk for renal dysfunction and interstitial nephritis.
Markedly increasing the fluid intake above the recommended dosage may ameliorate 
or even reverse the process of tubulointerstitial disease.
