BACKGROUND: The novel influenza A pandemic virus (H1N1pdm) caused considerable
morbidity and mortality worldwide in 2009. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the clinical course, duration of viral shedding, H1N1pdm evolution and
emergence of antiviral resistance in hospitalized cancer patients with severe
H1N1pdm infections during the winter of 2009 in Brazil.
METHODS: We performed a prospective single-center cohort study in a cancer center
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Hospitalized patients with cancer and a confirmed
diagnosis of influenza A H1N1pdm were evaluated. The main outcome measures in
this study were in-hospital mortality, duration of viral shedding, viral
persistence and both functional and molecular analyses of H1N1pdm susceptibility 
to oseltamivir.
RESULTS: A total of 44 hospitalized patients with suspected influenza-like
illness were screened. A total of 24 had diagnosed H1N1pdm infections. The
overall hospital mortality in our cohort was 21%. Thirteen (54%) patients
required intensive care. The median age of the studied cohort was 14.5 years
(3-69 years). Eighteen (75%) patients had received chemotherapy in the previous
month, and 14 were neutropenic at the onset of influenza. A total of 10 patients 
were evaluated for their duration of viral shedding, and 5 (50%) displayed
prolonged viral shedding (median 23, range=11-63 days); however, this was not
associated with the emergence of a resistant H1N1pdm virus. Viral evolution was
observed in sequentially collected samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged influenza A H1N1pdm shedding was observed in cancer
patients. However, oseltamivir resistance was not detected. Taken together, our
data suggest that severely ill cancer patients may constitute a pandemic virus
reservoir with major implications for viral propagation.
