Measles virus is a highly pathogenic virus that infects roughly 20 million people
per year. We report here the crystal structure of the measles virus
hemagglutinin, the surface glycoprotein responsible for the binding of measles
virus to its host cell receptors. Although the protein lacks neuraminidase
activity, its structure resembles a 'dead' neuraminidase fold, presenting
spatially distinct receptor-binding sites for its receptors CD46 and SLAM.
