Among the several threats to which free-ranging cetaceans are exposed, a number
of biological noxae are believed to represent a serious hazard to their health
and conservation on a global scale, with special emphasis on the Mediterranean
Sea. These pathogens include viral agents such as Morbillivirus, which during the
last 25 years have caused dramatic epidemics and die-offs among several aquatic
mammal species and populations worldwide, as well as Herpesvirus, protozoan
agents such as Toxoplasma gondii and bacterial pathogens such as Brucella spp.
