The influence of multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) types on detection of
concordant incident HPV infections of the cervix or anus following infection at
the other anatomic site was examined in a cohort of 897 women. Multiple HPV
infections at the anus were not significantly associated with subsequent
acquisition of a concordant cervical infection, whereas prior coinfections in the
cervix increased risk of a new cervical HPV infection. Incident anal HPV
infections following concordant cervical HPV infections increased significantly
among women with preexisting cervical or anal coinfections. Potential synergy in 
acquisition of cervical and anal HPV infections has implications for prophylactic
vaccine effectiveness.
