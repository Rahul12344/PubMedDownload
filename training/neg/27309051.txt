The largest epidemic of avian influenza (AI) in history attacked poultry and wild
birds throughout Taiwan starting January 6, 2015. This study analyzed
surveillance results, epidemiologic characteristics, and viral sequences by using
government-released information, with the intention to provide recommendations to
minimize future pandemic influenza. The H5 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic AI
viruses (HPAIVs) had not been detected in Taiwan before 2015. During this
epidemic, four types of etiologic agents were identified: the three novel
subtypes H5N2, H5N8, and H5N3 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs and one endemic chicken H5N2
subtype (Mexican-like lineage) of low pathogenic AI viruses. Cocirculation of
mixed subtypes also occurred, with H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs accompanied by the
H5N8 and H5N3 subtypes or old H5N2 viruses in the same farm. More than 90% of
domestic geese died from this AI epidemic; geese were affected the most at the
early outbreaks. The epidemic peaked in mid-January for all three novel H5
subtypes. Spatial epidemiology found that most affected areas were located in
southwestern coastal areas. In terrestrial poultry (mostly chickens), different
geographic distributions of AI virus subtypes were detected, with hot spots of
H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 vs. past-endemic old H5N2 viruses in Changhwa (P = 0.03) and
Yunlin (P = 0.007) counties, respectively, of central Taiwan. Phylogenetic and
sequence analyses of all the early 10 Taiwan H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolates covering
the three subtypes showed that they were very different from the HA of the past
local H5 viruses from domestic ducks (75%-80%) and chickens (70%-75%). However,
they had the highest sequence identity percentages (99.53%-100%), with the HA of 
A/crane/Kagoshima/KU13/2014(H5N8) isolated on December 7, 2014, in Japan being
higher than those of recent American and Korean H5 HPAIVs [A/Northern
pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014
(H5N8): 99.02%-99.54% and A/Baikal teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8):
98.61%-99.08%], implying a likely common ancestor of these H5 clade 2.3.4.4
viruses. The multiple subtypes of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 HPAIVs imply high viral
reassortment. We recommend establishing an integrated surveillance system,
involving clinical, virologic, and serologic surveillance in poultry and wild
birds, swine and other mammals prevalent on multiple-animal mixed-type
traditional farms, and high-risk human populations, as a crucially important step
to minimize future pandemic influenza.
