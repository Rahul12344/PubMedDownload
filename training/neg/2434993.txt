RNA complementary to a herpesvirus alpha gene mRNA is prominent in latently
infected neurons.

Stevens JG, Wagner EK, Devi-Rao GB, Cook ML, Feldman LT.

In initial attempts to define the molecular events responsible for the latent
state of herpes simplex virus, in situ hybridization was utilized to search for
virally encoded RNA transcripts in latently infected sensory neurons. The use of 
cloned probes representing the entire viral genome indicated that transcripts
encoded within terminal repeats were present. When the alpha genes encoding
ICP-0, ICP-4, and ICP-27 and the gamma 1 gene encoding VP-5 were employed, only
RNA transcripts hybridizing to the ICP-0 probe were detected. In latently
infected cells, the ICP-0--related transcripts were localized principally in the 
nucleus; this was not the case in acutely (productively) infected neurons or in
neurons probed for RNA transcripts coding for actin. In Northern blotting
experiments, an RNA of 2.6 kilobases was detected with the ICP-0 probe. When
single-stranded DNAs from the ICP-0 region were used as probes, RNA from the
strand complementary to that encoding ICP-0 messenger RNA (mRNA) was the major
species detected. This RNA species may play a significant role in maintaining the
latent infection.
