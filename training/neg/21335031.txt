Uncertainties and shortcomings associated with the current influenza vaccine
production processes demand attention and exploration of new vaccine manufacture 
technologies. Based on a newly developed mammalian cell culture-based production 
process we investigated selected process parameters and describe three factors
that are shown to impact productivity, process robustness and development time.
They are time of infection, harvest time and virus input, or multiplicity of
infection (MOI). By defining the time of infection as 4-5 days post cell seeding 
and harvest time as 2-3 days post-infection and comparing their effect on virus
production, MOI is subsequently identified as the most impactful process
parameter for live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) manufacture. Infection at 
very low MOI (between 10(-4) and 10(-6) FFU/cell) resulted in high titer virus
production (up to 30-fold productivity improvement) compared to higher MOI
infections (10(-3) to 10(-2) FFU/cell). Application of these findings has allowed
us to develop a platform process that can reduce the development time to
approximately three weeks for an influenza vaccine manufacture process for new
strains.
