Antiherpesviral activity and inhibitory action on cell growth of 5-alkenyl
derivatives of 1-beta D-arabinofuranosyluracil.

Machida H, Kuninaka A, Yoshino H, Ikeda K, Mizuno Y.

Antiherpesviral activity of 5-vinyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil was as high
as that of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylthymine, whereas the former was less
inhibitory to cell growth than the latter. 5-Propenyl- and
5-butenyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil were less active than
5-vinyl-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosyluracil.
