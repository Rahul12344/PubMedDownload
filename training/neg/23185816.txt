Because of the lack of screening methods, ovarian cancer remains one of the major
causes of mortality in gynecological oncology. Prevention by salpingectomy, based
on a concept about the origin of serous carcinoma, may be proven effective in the
future. Regarding cervical cancer, screening methods are improving and the
benefit of HPV-HR testing has been recently demonstrated. Metabolic requirements 
and exercise are modified during pregnancy. Present recommendations are for
pregnant women to practice regular moderate exercise, as in a non-pregnant
population. This guideline, despite being reasonable, is not based on strong
evidence. A randomised trial is ongoing in our Department to evaluate the effects
of exercise in women with gestational diabetes.
