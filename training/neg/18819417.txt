Epizootologic characteristics of rabies incidence in the Republic of
Bashkortostan for the period 1998 - 2006 are presented. Districts of
Bashkortostan are divided on 3 zones according to severity of epizootic
situation. Three years-cyclicity of rabies incidence with peak during winter was 
determined. Foxes, raccoons, wolves, lynxes, badgers, minks and, during recent
years, corsacs are involved into the epizootic chain. Main source of rabies in
the Republic is foxes with share of 91.9% among sick wild animals. During
1999-2006 8 cases of hydrophobia were registered. Results of analysis of
effectiveness of oral immunization and regulation of wild fauna population are
presented.
