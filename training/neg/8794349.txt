Alterations in plasma membrane function are induced by many cytopathic viruses,
including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). These alterations can
result in changes in the intracellular content of ions and other small molecules 
and can contribute to cytolysis and death of the infected cell. The pH-sensitive 
fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl 
ester was used to quantitate intracellular pH (pHi) in HIV-1-infected T cells.
Infection of cells from the CD4+ T-lymphoblastoid line HUT-78 (RH9 subclone) with
HIV-1 strain LAI resulted in a significant decrease of pHi, from approximately
7.2 in mock-infected cells to below 6.7 by day 4 after infection, when cells were
undergoing acute cytopathic effects. The pHi in persistently infected cells that 
survived the acute cytopathic effects of HIV-1 was approximately 6.8 to 7.0.
Studies with amiloride, an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchange system, suggest that 
HIV-1-induced intracellular acidification in lymphocytes is due, in part, to
dysfunction of this plasma membrane ion transport system. The alterations in pHi 
may mediate certain cytopathic effects of HIV-1, thereby contributing to
depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with AIDS.
