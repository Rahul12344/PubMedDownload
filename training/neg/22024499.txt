OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptors, a major component of the innate immune system,
play an important role in the initial response against pathogens. Genetic
abnormalities in some receptors like TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 have been associated
with susceptibility to fungal and viral infections while other aberrations in TLR
genes such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 may predispose to autoimmunity. Recently we
have shown an association of a TLR3 receptor variant, L412F, to susceptibility to
chronic candidiasis, recurrent viral and bacterial infections and autoimmunity.
We investigated here the biological implications of this TLR3 mutant.
METHODS: To study the functional impact of the L412F variant of TLR3 we tested
patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as well as fibroblasts for
secretion of cytokines in response to TLR3 ligand, candida or cytomegalovirus
(CMV). In addition, the P2.1 cell line was used as a model for the TLR3 WT and
L412F variant receptors function.
RESULTS: Patient's cells carrying the L412F variant showed reduced IFNγ as well
as TNFα secretion in response to stimulation with the TLR3 ligand, CMV or Candida
albicans. Fibroblasts with the L412F variant showed decreased secretion of IFNλ
in response to stimulation with both polyinosine ploycytidylic acid (Poly I:C)
and CMV and P2.1 cells transfected with the L412F variant showed reduced
secretion of IFN-β in comparison to cells transfected with the wild type
receptor.
CONCLUSION: We have shown here aberrant biological responses mediated by the TLR3
variant receptor, L412F, which may explain in part susceptibility of patients to 
chronic candidiasis, viral infections and autoimmunity.
