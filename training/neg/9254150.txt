OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the attitudes, knowledge and training needs for primary
care health professionals (PCP) dealing with HIV/AIDS infection.
DESIGN: An observational, crossover study.
SETTING: primary care: health districts in the Ciutat Vella health area of the
city of Barcelona.
PARTICIPANTS: 34 nursing professionals and 32 general practitioners.
INTERVENTIONS: A validated questionnaire, which was self-administered, anonymous 
and filled in under supervision during October 1994.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Everyone answered a 20-question multiple choice
test of knowledge and a 5-point Likert-type attitudes scale with 10 items. The
PCP overall displayed: insufficient scores on the test of knowledge, on positive 
attitudes, on the difficulty of asking about risk practices if the reason for
consultation is unrelated, on safety in handling, and need for training.
CONCLUSIONS: Half the PCP displayed a level of theoretical preparation in need of
improvement. Their positive attitudes and the clear need for more training on the
question make it very likely that our PCPs would take advantage of training
programmes. The situation in areas with less prevalence of the infection might
well be different.
