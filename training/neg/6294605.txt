Isolation and characterization of phi X174 mutants carrying lethal missense
mutations in gene G.

Chambers RW, Kućan I, Kućan Z.

A previously constructed Escherichia coli transformant carrying a functional copy
of bacteriophage phi X174 gene G on a plasmid, p phi XG, was used to isolate gene
G mutants carrying temperature sensitive and lethal missense mutations. Two of
the mutations have been characterized by sequencing: one carries a G --> A
transition at residue 2821 producing a Gly --> Ser change in codon 143 of the G
spike protein; the other carries an A --> G transition at residue 2678 producing 
Glu --> Gly change in codon 95. Sequencing DNA from 2 other mutants carrying
lethal mutations that are rescued with p phi XG did not reveal any changes in the
coding sequence. The lesion is believed to be in the intercistronic region
between genes F and G. The adsorption kinetics for these mutants appear to be
normal. Their burst size is about 25% that of wild type phi X174 on the host
carrying p phi XG. These results along with previous results from the senior
author's laboratory demonstrate that p phi XG can be used to rescue any gene G
mutant of phi X174 regardless of the nature of the mutation involved.
