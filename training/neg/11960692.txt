Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the eighth and most
recently identified human herpesvirus (HHV-8). KSHV was discovered in 1994 by
Chang et al. who used representational difference analysis to search for DNA
sequences present in AIDS-associated KS but not in adjacent normal skin [1]. The 
virus has since been shown to be specifically associated with all forms of this
disease and has fulfilled all of Hill's criteria for causation (reviewed in ).
KSHV is also found in all cases of primary effusion lymphoma and in a
plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castleman's disease. Over the last few
years a wealth of data has been gained on the role of KSHV genes during
infection. This review is an attempt to assemble this information into a more
complete picture of how KSHV may cause disease.
