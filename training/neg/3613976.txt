A serological survey for research on antibodies to arbovirus was carried out on
288 residents of the rural zone of the village of Corte de Pedra, Valença, Bahia.
It was observed that 3.8% of the sample population presented HI and N antibodies 
against Flaviviruses (Ilhéus 6, St. Louis 2, Yellow fever 3 and Rocio 1). One
person, who had previously lived in the Amazon region, had antibodies to Mayaro. 
The authors were unable to detect either N antibodies for Piry virus in a random 
sample of 75 persons or CF antibodies against viruses of the Changuinola and
Phlebotomus groups and ungrouped BE AR 408005 and BE AR 421710 in another random 
sample of 28 individuals. Complementary studies should be conducted in order to
define the transmission of the different viruses in the area.
