Class II transcription initiation is a highly regulated process and requires the 
assembly of a pre-initiation complex (PIC) containing DNA template, RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII), general transcription factors (GTFs) TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID,
TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH and Mediator. RNAPII, TFIID, TFIIH and Mediator are large
multiprotein complexes, each containing 10 and more subunits. Altogether, the PIC
is made up of about 60 polypeptides with a combined molecular weight of close to 
4MDa. Recent structural studies of key PIC components have significantly advanced
our understanding of transcription initiation. TFIID was shown to bind promoter
DNA in a reorganized state. The architecture of a core-TFIID complex was
elucidated. Crystal structures of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) bound to
TBP-associated factor 1 (TAF1), RNAPII-TFIIB complexes and the Mediator head
module were solved. The overall architectures of large PIC assemblies from human 
and yeast have been determined by electron microscopy (EM). Here we review these 
latest structural insights into the architecture and assembly of the PIC, which
reveal exciting new mechanistic details of transcription initiation.
