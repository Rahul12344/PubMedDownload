The RNA genome of human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) is encapsidated by
nucleoprotein (NP) to act as a template for RNA synthesis. We examined the
importance of individual amino acids in the RNA-binding domain of hPIV2 NP for
polymerase activity using a mini-replicon assay. We showed that substitution of
tyrosine at amino acid position 260, located in the RNA-binding pocket of NP,
severely reduced polymerase activity. The aromatic side-chain of Y260 may be
required for the formation of stable contacts between nucleotides and basic amino
acids, thereby affecting promoter recognition by the viral polymerase.
