Identification of DNA sequences required for activity of the cauliflower mosaic
virus 35S promoter.

Odell JT, Nagy F, Chua NH.

Although promoter regions for many plant nuclear genes have been sequenced,
identification of the active promoter sequence has been carried out only for the 
octopine synthase promoter. That analysis was of callus tissue and made use of an
enzyme assay. We have analysed the effects of 5' deletions in a plant viral
promoter in tobacco callus as well as in regenerated plants, including different 
plant tissues. We assayed the RNA transcription product which allows a more
direct assessment of deletion effects. The cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S
promoter provides a model plant nuclear promoter system, as its double-strand DNA
genome is transcribed by host nuclear RNA polymerase II from a CaMV
minichromosome. Sequences extending to -46 were sufficient for accurate
transcription initiation whereas the region between -46 and -105 increased
greatly the level of transcription. The 35S promoter showed no tissue-specificity
of expression.
