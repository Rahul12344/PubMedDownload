Ebola causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, and there 
are currently no approved therapeutic countermeasures. The virulence of Ebola
virus (EBOV) may be partially attributed to the secreted glycoprotein (sGP),
which is the main product transcribed from its GP gene. sGP is secreted from
infected cells and can be readily detected in the serum of EBOV-infected hosts.
This review summarizes the multiple roles that sGP may play during infection and 
highlights the implications for the future design of vaccines and treatments.
