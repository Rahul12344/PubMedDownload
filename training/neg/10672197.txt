Recombinant adenovirus, expressing the CS protein of Plasmodium yoelii, AdPyCS,
was shown to induce a comparable degree of T cell-mediated protection against
malaria as a single dose of irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites, causing inhibition 
of liver stage development. We now report that differently from
sporozoite-induced immunity, interferon (IFN)-gamma does not mediate the
protective immunity induced by AdPyCS, since a similar degree of protection was
observed in AdPyCS immunized mice lacking IFN-gamma-/- and the IFN-gamma receptor
(IFN-gammaR-/-) compared to that in wild-type mice. Depletion of CD8+ T cells
from these immunized mice almost completely abolished the AdPyCS-induced
immunity, indicating that the immunization with AdPyCS induces CD8+ T
cell-mediated protective anti-malaria immunity, which is independent of
IFN-gamma.
