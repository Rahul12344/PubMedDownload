BACKGROUND: Tetraspanins are transmembrane proteins that serve as scaffolds for
multiprotein complexes containing, for example, integrins, growth factor
receptors and matrix metalloproteases, and modify their functions in cell
adhesion, migration and transmembrane signaling. CD151 is part of the tetraspanin
family and it forms tight complexes with β1 and β4 integrins, both of which have 
been shown to be required for tumorigenesis and/or metastasis in transgenic mouse
models of breast cancer. High levels of the tetraspanin CD151 have been linked to
poor patient outcome in several human cancers including breast cancer. In
addition, CD151 has been implicated as a promoter of tumor angiogenesis and
metastasis in various model systems.
METHODS: Here we investigated the effect of Cd151 deletion on mammary
tumorigenesis by crossing Cd151-deficient mice with a spontaneously metastasising
transgenic model of breast cancer induced by the polyoma middle T antigen (PyMT) 
driven by the murine mammary tumor virus promoter (MMTV).
RESULTS: Cd151 deletion did not affect the normal development and differentiation
of the mammary gland. While there was a trend towards delayed tumor onset in
Cd151-/- PyMT mice compared to Cd151+/+ PyMT littermate controls, this result was
only approaching significance (Log-rank test P-value =0.0536). Interestingly,
Cd151 deletion resulted in significantly reduced numbers and size of primary
tumors but did not appear to affect the number or size of metastases in the
MMTV/PyMT mice. Intriguingly, no differences in the expression of markers of cell
proliferation, apoptosis and blood vessel density was observed in the primary
tumors.
CONCLUSION: The findings from this study provide additional evidence that CD151
acts to enhance tumor formation initiated by a range of oncogenes and strongly
support its relevance as a potential therapeutic target to delay breast cancer
progression.
