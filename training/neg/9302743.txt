Gene gun-based DNA immunization using vectors encoding HIV-1 gp120 or influenza
virus nucleoprotein result in Th2-like immune responses following successive
immunizations. The codelivery of vectors encoding IL-2, IL-7, or IL-12 blocked
this effect by markedly enhancing gp120-specific interferon gamma production, and
suppressing IL-4 and IgG1 responses. An unbiased augmentation of all immune
responses was observed by increasing the resting period between immunizations. In
this case, IFN-gamma production following in vitro stimulation increased by over 
1000-fold, while IL-4, IgG1, and IgG2a responses were elevated as well.
Interestingly, cytokine gene codelivery, in the context of the longer resting
period, provided no additional stimulation of Th1-like responses such as
IFN-gamma and IgG2a production, although there was still some suppression of IL-4
production. These data demonstrate that the quality and magnitude of responses
elicited following epidermal administration of DNA vaccines can be manipulated by
multiple means.
