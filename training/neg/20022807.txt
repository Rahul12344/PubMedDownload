Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis revealed that the genomes of
some pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains, including EDL933, were
resistant to NotI digestion. An amino acid sequence comparison suggested that the
z2389 gene carried on prophage CP-933R in strain EDL933 is likely to encode a
C(5)-cytosine methyltransferase. The z2389-equivalent gene was found in the
NotI-resistant strains tested, but it was not detected in the NotI-susceptible
strains. PFGE analysis of the wild-type EDL933 strain and of a z2389 null mutant 
revealed that z2389 was associated with full genome protection against NotI
digestion and partial protection against EagI digestion. In vitro methylation
experiments with purified recombinant protein demonstrated that Z2389 is capable 
of methylating NotI and EagI sites. Sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA indicated
that the methylation occurred at the first cytosine residue of the NotI
recognition sequence, whereas EagI sites remained unmethylated or were methylated
at the first cytosine residue. Thus, z2389 encodes a DNA cytosine
methyltransferase that confers full protection to NotI sites.
