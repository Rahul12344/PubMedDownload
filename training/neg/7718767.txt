The pleural effusion of a 79-year-old man who was a carrier of human T-cell
leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) showed monoclonal growth of HTLV-1 infected
T-cells. While the integration pattern of HTLV-1 was polyclonal in the peripheral
blood mononuclear cells, it was monoclonal in the infiltrated cells of the
pleural effusion. Morphologically atypical lymphoid cells were also found in the 
peripheral blood and in the pleural effusion. The pleural effusion disappeared
after treatment with antituberculous drugs. The nature of the monoclonal
proliferation of HTLV-1 infected T-lymphocytes is discussed.
