Cytokine-like antivirus factor, obtained from the culture fluid of chick embryo
fibroblasts, was found to possess inhibitory activity with respect to HIV-1
(strains 1/Zmb and RF). The treatment of HIV-infected cell culture with
cytokine-like factor was accompanied by a decrease in the cytopathic effect of
the agent without manifestations of cytotoxicity. The combined use of the
cytokine-like factor and azidothymidine at near-threshold concentrations was not 
accompanied by an increase in the antivirus effect, observed after the use of
each preparation separately.
