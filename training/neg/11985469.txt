Utilizing the tools of parallel synthesis and structure-based design, a new class
of Michael acceptor-containing, irreversible inhibitors of human rhinovirus 3C
protease (HRV 3CP) was discovered. These inhibitors are shown to inhibit HRV-14
3CP with rates of inactivation ranging from 886 to 31 400 M(-1) sec(-1). These
inhibitors exhibit antiviral activity when tested against HRV-14 infected H1-HeLa
cells, with EC(50) values ranging from 1.94 to 0.15 microM. No cytotoxicity was
observed at the limits of the assay concentration. A crystal structure of one of 
the more potent inhibitors covalently bound to HRV-2 3CP is detailed. These
compounds were also tested against HRV serotypes other than type 14 and were
found to have highly variable activities.
