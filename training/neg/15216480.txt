A uracil-to-cytosine point mutation at nucleotide (nt) 472 of Sabin oral
poliovirus vaccine (OPV) type 3 is found in conjunction with vaccine-associated
paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP). Direct RNA extraction and mutant analysis by
polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme cleavage were used to identify
this point mutation in clinical samples. A total of 238 stool samples were
obtained from 28 healthy infants for 6 weeks after OPV vaccination. More than 25%
of infants shed OPV3 in the week after vaccination, with a decrease on day 6. A
second wave of OPV3 shedding occurred beginning the second week after vaccination
and was maintained through the end of the study period. During the first week
after vaccination, the proportion of nt 472 mutants in the shed OPV3 increased
from undetectable to almost 100%. During the second shedding period, the
proportion of nt 472 mutants remained close to 100%. These results suggest that
selective mutation drives the VAPP-associated nt 472 point mutation for OPV3 in
the human gastrointestinal tract.
