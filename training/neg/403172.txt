Selective inhibition of Bacillus subtilis sporulation by acridine orange and
promethazine.

Burke WF Jr, Spizizen J.

Two structurally similar compounds were found to inhibit sporulation in Bacillus 
subtilis 168. A dye, acridine orange, and an antischizophrenic drug,
promethazine, blocked spore formation at concentrations subinhibitory to
vegetative growth, while allowing synthesis of serine protease, antibiotic, and
certain catabolite-repressed enzymes. The sporulation process was sensitive to
promethazine through T2, whereas acridine orange was inhibitory until T4. The
drug-treated cells were able to support the replication of phages phie and phi29,
although the lytic cycles were altered slightly. The selective inhibition of
sporulation by these compounds may be related to the affinity of some
sporulation-specific genes to intercalating compounds.
