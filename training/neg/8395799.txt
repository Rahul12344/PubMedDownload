Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against a variant subtype of
infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) from Delaware variant isolate A (Var-A).
Splenocytes from immunized mice were fused to myeloma cells, and
antibody-producing hybridomas were screened by dot-blot enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence (IF) against the
homologous isolate. Specificity of the MAbs was tested against viral isolates
representing all six serologic subtypes of IBDV and three untyped IBDVs--GLS,
Ark, and Miss--found in serotype 1 by dot-blot ELISA and IF. The MAb G11
recognized all isolates, whereas H7 did not recognize two viruses in subtype 1,
the Lukert strain and APHIS. MAbs G11 and H7 were not neutralizing and identified
both the precursor proteins (VP2a) and protein product (VP2b of VP2) in Western
immunoblots. Results showed an antigenic determinant in IBDV isolates and
antigenic variation between subtype 1 viruses and other subtypes. This confirms
and extends previous work that showed that IBDVs evolved from subtype 1 by
alteration or substitution of antigenic sites.
