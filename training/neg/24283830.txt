There is evidence that the life expectancy (LE) of individuals infected with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has increased since the introduction of
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, mortality rates in recent
years in HIV-positive individuals appear to have remained higher than would be
expected based on rates seen in the general population. A low CD4 count, whether 
due to late HIV diagnosis, late initiation of cART, or incomplete adherence to
cART, remains the dominant predictor of LE, and thus the individual's disease
stage at initiation of cART (or thereafter) certainly contributes to these higher
mortality rates. However, individuals with HIV also tend to exhibit lifestyles
and behaviors that place them at increased risk of mortality, particularly from
non-AIDS causes. Thus, although mortality rates among the HIV population may
indeed remain slightly higher than those seen in the general population, they may
be no higher than those seen in a more appropriately matched control group. Thus,
further improvements in LE may now only be possible if some of the other
underlying issues (for example, modification of lifestyle or behavioral factors) 
are tackled.
