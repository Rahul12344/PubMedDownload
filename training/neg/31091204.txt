Anal squamous cell carcinomas (ASCCs) frequently harbor human papillomavirus
(HPV), most commonly high-risk (HR-) HPV type 16. While p16 immunohistochemistry 
(IHC) is typically used as a surrogate for HR-HPV status in the oropharynx and
cervix, its overexpression can also occur as a result of oncogenic stress and
sometimes prove nonspecific. There have been recent investigations into the use
of HPV RNA in situ hybridization (RISH) assays as an alternative method, which
have shown robust results for squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx and
cervix. Our study evaluated HPV RISH and p16 IHC in 50 ASCCs, as well as the
clinicopathologic features of ASCC relative to HPV status. We found that HPV RISH
and p16 IHC were closely in agreement with 96% concordance. Using the 2
methodologies, 78% of ASCCs were HR-HPV positive, 10% were low-risk HPV positive,
and 12% were HPV-negative. None of our cases showed co-infection across HR-HPV
and low-risk HPV. ASCCs that were not related to HR-HPV were more likely to have 
a typical keratinizing morphology (P=0.05) and more likely to involve the
perianal area (P=0.006). HPV-negative cases were particularly aggressive with
high rates of metastases and patient death within 2 years of diagnosis. Overall, 
HPV RISH appears to be a reliable methodology for testing, and HPV status may
have implications for prognostication of ASCCs.
