We investigated the effects of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTC;
Procysteine), a cysteine prodrug, on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 
expression in both adult peripheral and cord blood mononuclear phagocytes and
lymphocytes. OTC suppressed HIV-1 expression in monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDM) and lymphocytes in a dose-dependent fashion as determined by HIV-1 reverse 
transcriptase (RT) activity. This inhibitory effect of OTC occurred with three
HIV-1 strains (two laboratory-adapted strains and one primary isolate). Addition 
of OTC to chronically HIV-1-infected MDM cultures also suppressed RT activity by 
40 to 50% in comparison to untreated controls. The inhibitory effects of OTC on
HIV-1 were not caused by toxicity to MDM or lymphocytes because there was no
change in cell viability or cellular DNA synthesis, as evaluated by trypan blue
dye exclusion and [3H]thymidine incorporation, at doses of OTC that inhibit virus
replication. These observations indicate that OTC has the potential to limit
HIV-1 replication in mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes and may be useful in 
the treatment of HIV-1 infection and AIDS.
