The capsid assembly is an essential step for Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) life cycle
and is an important target for anti-HBV drug development. In this report, we
identified a hit compound with aminothiazole structure by the high throughput
screening (HTS) which inhibited the interaction of HBV capsid protein within the 
cells. The structure hopping and SAR studies of the hit compound afforded
compound 79 with potent anti-HBV replication activity and good basic drug-like
properties. The working mechanism studies showed that compound 79 could bind to
the similar binding site of known HBV capsid inhibitor with
heteroaryldihydropyrimidine (HAP) scaffold, through similar hydrophobic
interactions but with a different hydrogen bond. This compound exerted potent
inhibitory effect upon HBV production, either in cell culture or in mice with no 
obvious acute toxicity. We propose that further development of this compound
could lead to novel potent anti-HBV inhibitors that target HBV capsid assembly.
