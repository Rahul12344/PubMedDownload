Wild type PC12 pheochromocytoma cells that had been infected with a
Wnt-1-carrying virus and thus express Wnt-1 (PC12/Wnt-1) are known to acquire the
same flat cell phenotype as that of spontaneously occurring PC12 flat cell
variants except that the latter do not presently express Wnt-1. Flat cell
variants of PC12 cells exhibit markedly altered morphology and gene expression.
In order to assess the possibility that the spontaneously occurring flat cell
variants could have been induced in wild type PC12 cells by previous transient
expression of the cell's endogenous Wnt-1, we have isolated PC12/Wnt-1 cells
expressing little or no Wnt-1. In spite of absent Wnt-1 expression, they retained
their flat cell morphology, glutamate/aspartate transporter activity, increased
neu mRNA levels and lack of both norepinephrine transporter activity and nerve
growth factor-induced differentiation. Thus, Wnt-1 expression is not required to 
maintain the flat cell phenotype. However, we identified one gene, ret, whose
mRNA level in PC12 was not only increased by Wnt-1 expression, but whose
increased mRNA level was also dependent on continual Wnt-1 expression. This
finding suggests that the induction of ret by Wnt-1 can be used to elucidate the 
Wnt-induced signalling pathway in mammalian cells.
