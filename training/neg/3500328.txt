Peripheral blood lymphocytes from chimpanzees infected for 3 months to more than 
3 years with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had normal T-cell proliferative
responses after stimulation with a variety of recall antigens and mitogens,
indicating that HIV infection does not cause detectable immunological impairment 
in chimpanzees. This finding contrasts with that obtained in HIV-infected humans,
who often have impaired T-cell reactivity. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from most
HIV-infected chimpanzees that were studied also had strong proliferative
responses to purified HIV as well as to HIV envelope glycoproteins isolated from 
the virus, to recombinant HIV envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, and to HIV
gag protein p24. The HIV-specific T-cell responses in HIV-infected chimpanzees
may contribute to prevention of the development of acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome in this species.
