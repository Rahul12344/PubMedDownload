The present study provides direct experimental proof that the combination of
influenza virus infection A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N3) with different models of oxidative 
stress, such as immobilization, cold and cold-restraint, is associated with
graduated oxidative disturbances in the stomach of mice, despite the absence of
virus replication and inflammation in this tissue. It was found that experimental
influenza virus infection is accompanied with significant changes in gastric
mucosal integrity, as well as an increase in the products of lipid peroxidation
in the stomachs of mice. Preliminary exposure of mice to immobilization stress
and subsequent inoculation of influenza virus did not significantly influence
gastric ulceration or lipid peroxidation compared with infected mice. Cold stress
resulted in a significant decrease in the index of stomach ulceration and did not
influence the fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation and MDA compared with
infected animals. The simultaneous application of cold-restraint stress and
influenza virus infection provoked synergism in the activity of all factors on
the parameters under investigation. Ulceration increased approximately two-fold, 
as did the amount of fluorescent products of lipid peroxidation and MDA, compared
with influenza virus-infected and non-stressed animals.
