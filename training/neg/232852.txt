Dolphin pox: a skin disease of cetaceans.

Geraci JR, Hicks BD, St Aubin DJ.

Poxvirus has been identified morphologically from skin lesions in captive and
free-ranging bottlenosed dolphins, Tursiops truncatus and a stranded Atlantic
white-sided dolphin, Lagenorhynchus acutus. The lesions, commonly referred to as 
ring or pinhole lesions, appear as solitary or coalesced circular grey blemishes.
Advanced ring lesions may take the form of black punctiform stippled patterns
known as "tattoo". Histologically, the stratum externum is thickened, and there
is ballooning degeneration and eosinophilic intractyoplasmic inclusions in the
stratum intermedium. These includions contain virus particles which exhibit
typical poxvirus morphology. Stress, environmental conditions and general health 
appear to play a major role in the clinical manifestation of dolphin pox.
