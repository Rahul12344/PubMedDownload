Bicistronic retroviral vectors were constructed containing the foot-and-mouth
disease virus (FMDV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) followed by the coding
region of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) or therapeutic genes, with the selectable
neomycin phosphotransferase gene under the control of the viral long terminal
repeat (LTR) promoter. LNFX, a vector with a multiple cloning site 3' to
foot-and-mouth disease virus IRES, was used to construct vectors encoding rat
erythropoietin (EP), rat granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), human
adenosine deaminase (ADA) and beta-gal. In transduced primary rat vascular smooth
muscle cells the cytokines were expressed at high levels, similar to those
obtained from vectors employing the viral LTR promoter. LNFZ, a vector encoding
beta-gal, had a 10-fold increase in titer over that of LNPoZ, a comparable vector
containing the poliovirus (Po) internal ribosome entry site. Primary canine
vascular smooth muscle cells infected with LNFZ and LNPoZ expressed similar
activities of beta-gal and neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT). Overall, these
vectors had titers between 10(6) and 2 x 10(7) c.f.u./ml, indicating that
foot-and-mouth disease virus IRES provides high-titer bicistronic vectors with
high-level two gene expression.
