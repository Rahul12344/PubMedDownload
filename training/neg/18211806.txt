Transient expression of engineered reporter RNAs encoding an intron-containing
green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a Potato virus X-based expression vector
previously demonstrated the nuclear targeting capability of the 359 nucleotide
Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) RNA genome. To further delimit the putative
nuclear-targeting signal, PSTVd subgenomic fragments were embedded within the
intron, and recombinant reporter RNAs were inoculated onto Nicotiana benthamiana 
plants. Appearance of green fluorescence in leaf tissue inoculated with
PSTVd-fragment-containing constructs indicated shuttling of the RNA into the
nucleus by fragments as short as 80 nucleotides in length. Plant-to-plant
variation in the timing of intron removal and subsequent GFP fluorescence was
observed; however, earliest and most abundant GFP expression was obtained with
constructs containing the conserved hairpin I palindrome structure and embedded
upper central conserved region. Our results suggest that this conserved sequence 
and/or the stem-loop structure it forms is sufficient for import of PSTVd into
the nucleus.
