Emerging diseases. Malaysian researchers trace Nipah virus outbreak to bats.

Enserink M.

Scientists are a step closer to unraveling a medical mystery that killed 105
people in Malaysia last year and destroyed the country's pig industry. The Nipah 
virus, which caused the disease, most likely originated in a native fruit bat
species, Malaysian researchers reported here at a meeting last week. They say the
findings will help Malaysian health authorities prevent future outbreaks of the
Nipah virus. Others see the case as an argument for expanding research into
infections that can leap the boundary between animals and humans.
