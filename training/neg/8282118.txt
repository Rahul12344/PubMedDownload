Brefeldin A is a macrolide antibiotic that interferes with membrane traffic and
blocks the growth of several animal viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus 
(VSV). The inhibition of VSV by brefeldin A takes place at least at two different
steps during the growth cycle: the glycosylation of VSV G protein and the
replication of viral genomes. Our results indicate that interference with
membrane traffic leads not only to inhibition of viral protein glycosylation, but
also to the blockade of virus genome replication in several cytoplasmic
RNA-containing viruses.
