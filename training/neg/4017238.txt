Can potentially infectious specimens containing hepatitis B virus be identified
on the basis of their biochemical profile?

Burnett L, Lowe SB, Chan B, Whitfield JB, Nightingale BN, Hensley WJ.

The potential infectivity of 1129 randomly selected plasma specimens was directly
assayed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA dot-hybridization. Presence or absence of 
HBV was then correlated with a biochemical profile of 20 common analytes obtained
on these same specimens. We found that potentially infectious specimens could not
be identified on the basis of any combination of simple biochemical tests;
indeed, the infectious specimens were more "normal" in some tests of liver
function than were the non-infectious specimens.
