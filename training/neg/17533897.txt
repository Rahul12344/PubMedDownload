Protein-losing gastropathy is an uncommon disease of uncertain etiology, known
also as Menetrier's disease. In medical literature only 50 pediatric cases have
been described. These childhood forms, in contrast to classic adult Menetrier's
disease, have a typical benign and transient course, and require only supportive 
therapy. The role of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in the pathogenesis has been
demonstrated by gastric biopsy in one third of the cases. Also other infectious, 
allergic and immunological factors have been hypothesized. We describe a case of 
hypertrophic gastropathy with important protein-loss, admitted to our Pediatric
Department for evaluation because of vomit, weight loss, abdominal pain and
hypoalbuminemia. Gastric mucosal biopsy revealed a morphological evidence of CMV 
infection.
