Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is an enterovirus in the family Picornaviridae that is
significant to human health, being associated with myocarditis, aseptic
meningitis, and pancreatitis, among other conditions. In addition to humans,
Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys can be infected and killed by CVB3. Here, we report
the first complete genome sequence of a novel coxsackievirus B3 strain, SSM-CVB3,
which was isolated from a deceased Sichuan snub-nosed monkey with severe
myocarditis. Our findings may aid in understanding the evolutionary
characteristics and molecular pathogenesis of this virus.
