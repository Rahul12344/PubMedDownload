The identification of immune pathways that protect against pathogens may lead to 
novel molecular therapies for both livestock and human health. Interferon (IFN)
is a major response pathway that stimulates multiple genes targeted towards
reducing virus. Viperin is one such interferon stimulated gene (ISG) that helps
protect mammals from virus and may be critical to protecting chickens in the same
way. In chickens, ISGs are not generally well characterised and viperin, in
concert with other ISGs, may be important in protecting against virus. Here we
identify chicken viperin (ch-viperin) and show that ch-viperin is upregulated in 
response to viral signature molecules. We further show that viperin is
upregulated in response to virus infection in vivo. This data will benefit
investigators targeting the antiviral pathways in the chicken.
