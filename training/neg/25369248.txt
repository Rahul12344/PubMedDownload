OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical pathology of recurrent hepatitis B after
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).
METHODS: The clinical manifestation and hepatic pathological characteristics of
12 patients with recurrent hepatitis B after OLT were examined in this study by
using hematoxylin and eosin staining,immunochemical staining of hepatitis B
surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen,tissue in situ hybridization of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and Mallory's trichrome staining.The survival rate
of these OLT patients was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: The early stage of recurrent HBV infection in patients with OLT was
characterized by active HBV replication and mild-to-moderate inflammation in the 
liver. Three of the 12 patients who were treated with combination therapy group
were carriers of YMDD mutants and all three showed improvement in liver function 
and hepatic histology after receiving adefovir dipivoxil,instead of lamivudine,in
the early stage of recurrent hepatitis B after OLT. Among the patients treated
with lamivudine monotherapy, four did not achieve improvement at the early stage 
of recurrent hepatitis B and developed fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis (FCH).
CONCLUSION: Recurrent hepatitis B in patients who underwent OLT was characterized
by mild-to-moderate viral hepatitis at the early stage and FCH at the later
stage. Effective antiviral intervention at the early stage may reverse recurrent 
hepatitis B and prevent the disease progression to fatal FCH.
