This study used a previously described multiplex PCR-based reverse line blot
(mPCR/RLB) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital
pathogens or putative pathogens, namely Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia
trachomatis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma hominis, Trichomonas vaginalis,
Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Neisseria
meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex
virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. First-voided urine specimens and
endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending
three sexual health clinics in Sydney, Australia, were tested and the results
were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. One hundred and 
sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one
target organism, most commonly G. vaginalis and Ureaplasma spp. The prevalence of
each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. Of the 216
women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or
urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. Only G. vaginalis
was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (P = 0.05). The specificity
of the mPCR/RLB assay compared with that of the reference methods for each
organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. The mean sensitivities of the
mPCR/RLB assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected
vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms 
were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not
significant. There were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types
for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis and H. influenzae, although all 
were found infrequently. Overall, the mPCR/RLB platform was found to be an
accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.
