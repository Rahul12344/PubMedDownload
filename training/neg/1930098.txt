The pathogenetic mechanism leading to liver tissue injury in hepatitis caused by 
hepatitis A virus is unclear. We have randomly established T cell clones from
liver biopsies from 4 patients with hepatitis A. A total of 578 clones was
phenotypically analyzed. Whereas during the acute phase of disease CD8+ clones
dominated over CD4+ clones, from a biopsy taken late after onset of clinical
syndromes more CD4+ than CD8+ clones were obtained. Interestingly, in a patient
with a second exacerbation of the disease, more than 20% of all clones had the
CD3+ WT31- CD4- CD8- gamma delta TCR+ phenotype. Variable IFN-gamma production
was observed with all types of T cell clones. All CD8+ clones had cytotoxic
activity, and approximately 60% of all CD8+ clones showed specific cytotoxicity
against autologous fibroblasts infected with hepatitis A virus but not with
herpes simplex, adeno- or enteroviruses. These results show that the liver injury
in hepatitis A is not caused by a viral cytopathogenic effect but is due to an
immunopathological reaction of sensitized cytotoxic T lymphocytes against
infected hepatocytes. In addition, these studies show an enrichment of CD4-8-
alpha beta T cell receptor negative T lymphocytes at the site of an inflammation 
and suggest a role of these cells in an antiviral reaction.
