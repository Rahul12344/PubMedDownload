BACKGROUND: Internet-based surveillance systems to monitor influenza-like illness
(ILI) have advantages over traditional (physician-based) reporting systems, as
they can potentially monitor a wider range of cases (i.e. including those that do
not seek care). However, the requirement for participants to have internet access
and to actively participate calls into question the representativeness of the
data. Such systems have been in place in a number of European countries over the 
last few years, and in July 2009 this was extended to the UK. Here we present
results of this survey with the aim of assessing the reliability of the data, and
to evaluate methods to correct for possible biases.
METHODS: Internet-based monitoring of ILI was launched near the peak of the first
wave of the UK H1N1v influenza pandemic. We compared the recorded ILI incidence
with physician-recorded incidence and an estimate of the true number of cases
over the course of the epidemic. We also compared overall attack rates. The
effect of using different ILI definitions and alternative denominator assumptions
on incidence estimates was explored.
RESULTS: The crude incidence measured by the internet-based system appears to be 
influenced by individuals who participated only once in the survey and who
appeared more likely to be ill. This distorted the overall incidence trend.
Concentrating on individuals who reported more than once results in a time series
of ILI incidence that matches the trend of case estimates reasonably closely,
with a correlation of 0.713 (P-value: 0.0001, 95% CI: 0.435, 0.867). Indeed, the 
internet-based system appears to give a better estimate of the relative height of
the two waves of the UK pandemic than the physician-recorded incidence. The
overall attack rate is, however, higher than other estimates, at about 16% when
compared with a model-based estimate of 6%.
CONCLUSION: Internet-based monitoring of ILI can capture the trends in case
numbers if appropriate weighting is used to correct for differential response.
The overall level of incidence is, however, difficult to measure. Internet-based 
systems may be a useful adjunct to existing ILI surveillance systems as they
capture cases that do not necessarily contact health care. However, further
research is required before they can be used to accurately assess the absolute
level of incidence in the community.
