BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) has been suggested as
a clinically relevant highly specific biomarker of acute kidney tubular damage.
However, community-based data on the association between urinary levels of KIM-1 
and the risk for cardiovascular mortality are lacking. This study aimed to
investigate the association between urinary KIM-1 and cardiovascular mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: This was a prospective study,
using the community-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (N=590; mean
age 77 years; baseline period, 1997-2001; median follow-up 8.1 years; end of
follow-up, 2008).
RESULTS: During follow-up, 89 participants died of cardiovascular causes
(incidence rate, 2.07 per 100 person-years at risk). Models were adjusted for
cardiovascular risk factors (age, systolic BP, diabetes, smoking, body mass
index, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, antihypertensive treatment,
lipid-lowering treatment, aspirin treatment, and history of cardiovascular
disease) and for markers of kidney dysfunction and damage (cystatin C-based eGFR 
and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio). Higher urinary KIM-1/creatinine (from
24-hour urine collections) was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular
mortality (hazard ratio per SD increase, 1.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 
1.05 to 1.54; P=0.01). Participants with a combination of high KIM-1/creatinine
(upper quintile, ≥175 ng/mmol), low eGFR (≤60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), and
microalbuminuria/macroalbuminuria (albumin/creatinine ratio≥3 g/mol) had a
>8-fold increased risk compared with participants with low KIM-1/creatinine (<175
ng/mmol), normal eGFR (>60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), and normoalbuminuria
(albumin/creatinine ratio<3 g/mol) (hazard ratio, 8.56; 95% CI, 4.17 to 17.56;
P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that higher urinary KIM-1 may predispose to a
higher risk of cardiovascular mortality independently of established
cardiovascular risk factors, eGFR, and albuminuria. Additional studies are needed
to further assess the utility of measuring KIM-1 in the clinical setting.
