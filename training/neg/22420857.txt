Pseudolysogeny can be defined as the stage of stalled development of a
bacteriophage in a host cell without either multiplication of the phage genome
(as in lytic development) or its replication synchronized with the cell cycle and
stable maintenance in the cell line (as in lysogenization), which proceeds with
no viral genome degradation, thus allowing the subsequent restart of virus
development. This phenomenon is usually caused by unfavorable growth conditions
for the host cell (such as starvation) and is terminated with initiation of
either true lysogenization or lytic growth when growth conditions improve.
Pseudolysogeny has been known for tens of years; however, its role has often been
underestimated. Currently, it is being considered more often as an important
aspect of phage-host interactions. The reason for this is mostly an increased
interest in phage-host interactions in the natural environment. Pseudolysogeny
seems to play an important role in phage survival, as bacteria in a natural
environment are starved or their growth is very slow. This phenomenon can be an
important aspect of phage-dependent bacterial mortality and may influence the
virulence of some bacterial strains.
