Volume-sensitive Cl- channels [ICl(vol)] were studied using taurine efflux and
patch-clamp experiments in 9HTEo- human tracheal cells. Cells were stimulated
with the Ca(2+)- elevating agents ATP and ionomycin in isotonic medium or in
hypotonic solutions. ATP (100 microM) or ionomycin (1 microM) and hypotonic shock
produced a synergic effect. Indeed, the resulting taurine efflux was much higher 
than the sum of the single effects elicited by ATP, ionomycin, or hypotonic
medium. The taurine release elicited by hypotonic shock and the potentiation by
ATP and ionomycin were markedly inhibited by using a Ca(2+)-free extracellular
medium and by incubating the cells with the membrane-permeable 1,2-bis(2-amino-
phenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester chelating agent.
Patch-clamp experiments confirmed the role of Ca2+ on ICl(vol) channels.
Swelling-induced taurine efflux was inhibited by reactive blue 2, suramin, and
pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid. Patch-clamp experiments
demonstrated that these compounds shift the voltage-dependent inactivation of
ICl(vol) channels toward more negative values. This study indicates that the
sensitivity of ICl(vol) to cell volume changes is modulated by intracellular Ca2+
and that purinergic receptor antagonists represent a new class of CI- channel
blockers.
