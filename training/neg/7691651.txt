We examined the relationship between the presence of antibody to HCV and sexually
transmitted diseases in 151 female, intravenous drug users aged 17-43 years.
Anti-HCV was present in 49 of 66 HIV-1-negative women (74.2%), and 63 of 85
HIV-1-positive women (74.1%). Anti-HCV seropositivity was significantly related
to sexually transmitted infections (Ureaplasma urealyticum infections excluded)
in HIV-1-seronegative women, but not in HIV-1-positive women. Also, in
HIV-1-negative subjects. Trichomonas vaginalis infections (and infections with M.
hominis) were significantly related to anti-HCV seropositivity, and a positive
relation between the number of sexual partners and the presence of anti-HCV was
demonstrated. In HIV-1-positive subjects a shared use of needles and syringes was
more likely, and an increased parenteral exposure to HCV may decrease the
relative contribution by sexual transmission. However, in HIV-1-negative
subjects, sexual transmission of HCV appears to be both a possible and important 
means of transmission.
