A number of positively charged polypeptides and proteins bundle DNA, F-actin,
microtubules, and viruses such as filamentous phage fd and tobacco mosaic virus
(TMV), as well as intermediate filaments formed by vimentin. The general behavior
is dictated by the common polyelectrolyte nature of these biopolymers, which
gives rise to nonspecific binding by ligands carrying several net opposite
charges. An attractive interaction accounts for the subsequent lateral
aggregation, distinguishing this transition from the liquid crystalline formation
of filamentous particles at high concentrations. Morphologically similar filament
bundles can also be induced by inert solutes such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)
and proteins that do not bind the macromolecular filaments, but the
physicochemistry underlying this class of bundle transitions is distinct. In
particular, bundling transitions induced by electrostatic and steric mechanisms
have an opposite dependence on the solution ionic strength and the concentration 
of the filamentous biopolymers. The distinct mechanisms illustrated in this
report may each contribute to the formation of specific polymer bundles under
physiological conditions.
