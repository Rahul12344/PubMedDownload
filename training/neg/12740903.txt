Our study attempts to establish the relationship between telomerase activity and 
allelic imbalance (AI) on chromosomes 3p and 6 in high-risk HPV-containing
cervical lesions. These chromosomes were implicated previously in telomerase
regulation in HPV containing immortalized cells and cervical cancer cells.
Allelotyping and telomerase analysis were carried out on 28 high-grade cervical
lesions (CIN III: n = 20; cervical carcinomas: n = 8), using 23 microsatellite
markers on 3p, 6p and 6q. Clear telomerase activity was found in 17 of 28 lesions
(61%). Allelic imbalance frequency at 6q14-22 was significantly higher in lesions
with detectable telomerase activity, compared to lesions without telomerase
activity (p = 0.02). No association was found between telomerase activity and AI 
at any of the remaining regions studied on 3p and chromosome 6. In addition, in
telomerase positive passages of the HPV 16 immortalized cell line FK16A, shown
recently to be responsive to chromosome 6 mediated telomerase repression, AI was 
found in the overlapping region of 6q14-27. These data suggest that 6q14-22 may
contain 1 or more genes involved in telomerase deregulation and immortalization
during cervical carcinogenesis.
