In an attempt to define the virological profile of HBV in HCV co-infection, we
analysed the viral load, the infecting genotype, and the mutational pattern of
the HBV pre-core region (pre-C), which is involved in viral encapsidation and DNA
replication. Eighty-six patients were studied: 32 with serological HBV/HCV-1b
co-infection (group BC), 32 infected by HBV alone (group B), and 22 by HCV-1b
alone (group C). Sequence analysis of the HBV pre-S and pre-C regions identified 
genotypes and mutational patterns. The HBV viral load was significantly lower in 
group BC than in group B (p < 0.001), and the distribution of HBV pre-C mutations
showed a higher prevalence of wild type in concomitant infection than in the
control group (p < 0.006). The predominant HBV infecting strain was genotype D in
both the BC (96%) and B (87%) groups. No difference was observed in HCV viremia
levels between the two groups, whereas in HBV/HCV infection, the low levels of
circulating HBV were closely associated with the low degree of variability of
pre-C domain (p = 0.005). In conclusion, in HBV/HCV infection, the virological
pattern was characterised by the dominance of HCV associated with lower HBV
replication capacity and decreased emergence of HBV pre-C variants.
