Recombinant adeno-associated virus derived vectors (rAAV) a thought to be a most 
promising candidates for gene therapy applications. Their nonpathogenic nature as
well as the encouraging capability to infect both proliferating and non
proliferating cells are advantages for gene therapy applications. Here, we
summarize the potential mechanisms responsible for AAV maintenance and
site-specific integration to human genome. The role of Rep proteins, inverted
terminal repeats and p5 promotor sequences for chromosomal incorporation of AAV
are discussed. Making the site-specific integrative recombinant AAV vectors for
gene therapy seems to be closely dependent on the development of viral
vectorology.
