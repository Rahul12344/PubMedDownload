A key function of the Vpu protein of HIV-1 is the targeting of newly-synthesized 
CD4 for proteasomal degradation. This function has been proposed to occur by a
mechanism that is fundamentally distinct from the cellular ER-associated
degradation (ERAD) pathway. However, using a combination of genetic, biochemical 
and morphological methodologies, we find that CD4 degradation induced by Vpu is
dependent on a key component of the ERAD machinery, the VCP-UFD1L-NPL4 complex,
as well as on SCF(beta-TrCP)-dependent ubiquitination of the CD4 cytosolic tail
on lysine and serine/threonine residues. When degradation of CD4 is blocked by
either inactivation of the VCP-UFD1L-NPL4 complex or prevention of CD4
ubiquitination, Vpu still retains the bulk of CD4 in the ER mainly through
transmembrane domain interactions. Addition of a strong ER export signal from the
VSV-G protein overrides this retention. Thus, Vpu exerts two distinct activities 
in the process of downregulating CD4: ER retention followed by targeting to late 
stages of ERAD. The multiple levels at which Vpu engages these cellular quality
control mechanisms underscore the importance of ensuring profound suppression of 
CD4 to the life cycle of HIV-1.
