Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are a frequent cause of gastroenteritis in young
children and immunocompromised patients. The current report describes a new
approach to recover genetically defined HAstVs through the use of a reverse
genetics system based on a single DNA plasmid. This plasmid, carrying the
full-length virus genome under a T7 promoter, is directly transfected into cells 
expressing T7 RNA polymerase, resulting in the rapid and robust recovery of
infectious HAstV. The efficiency of the system was tested with the generation of 
a chimeric astrovirus having the HAstV serotype 1 replication machinery and the
capsid derived from a HAstV serotype 8 virus. This new system provides an
efficient and reproducible method to deepen our knowledge of astrovirus biology.
