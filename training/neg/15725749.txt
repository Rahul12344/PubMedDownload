The combination of unique single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CCR5 regulatory 
and in the CCR2 and CCR5 coding regions, defined nine CCR5 human haplogroups
(HH): HHA-HHE, HHF*1, HHF*2, HHG*1, and HHG*2. Here we examined the distribution 
of CCR5 HH and their association with HIV infection and disease progression in 36
HIV-seronegative and 76 HIV-seropositive whites from North America and Spain [28 
rapid progressors (RP) and 48 slow progressors (SP)]. Although analyses revealed 
that HHE frequencies were similar between HIV-seronegative and HIV-seropositive
groups (25.0% vs. 32.2%, p > 0.05), HHE frequency in RP was significantly higher 
than that in SP (48.2% vs. 22.9%, p = 0.002). Survival analysis also showed that 
HHE heterozygous and homozygous were associated with an accelerated CD4 cell
count decline to less than 200 cells/microL (adjusted RH 2.44, p = 0.045;
adjusted RH = 3.12, p = 0.037, respectively). These data provide further evidence
that CCR5 human haplogroups influence HIV-1 disease progression in HIV-infected
persons.
