Rabies virus glycoprotein and snake venom curaremimetic neurotoxins share a
region of high homology (30-45 for neurotoxins and 190-203 for the glycoprotein) 
in the regions that are believed to be responsible for binding the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor. Monoclonal antibodies raised to the 190-203 synthetic
fragment of rabies virus glycoprotein were immobilized on a high performance
affinity chromatography column and were able to bind neurotoxins. Toxins were
displaced from the affinity column by elution at acidic pH and by affinity
competition with acetylcholine at neutral pH. Furthermore, the affinity column
proved to be useful for the purification of cholinergic ligands. Overall, these
results indicate that the paratope of our monoclonal antibodies could behave as
an 'internal image' of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor acetylcholine binding
site.
