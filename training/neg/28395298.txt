Purpose: To investigate which cytokines and chemokines are involved in the
immunopathogenesis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), and whether cytokine profiles
are associated with clinical manifestations, such as visual outcome.
Methods: Serum and aqueous humor (AH) samples of 19 patients with ARN were
analyzed by multiplex immunoassay. Infectious controls consisted of 18 patients
with rubella virus-associated Fuchs' uveitis and 20 patients with ocular
toxoplasmosis all confirmed by intraocular fluid analyses. The control group
consisted of seven paired AH and serum samples from seven noninflammatory control
patients with age-related cataract. In each sample, 4 anti-inflammatory, 12
proinflammatory, 2 vascular, and 4 other immune mediators were measured. In
addition, various clinical characteristics were assessed.
Results: In ARN, 10 of the 22 mediators, including most proinflammatory and
vascular mediators such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, MIF, MCP-1, Eotaxin, IP-10, IL-15, 
sICAM-1, and sVCAM-1, were significantly elevated when compared to all controls. 
In addition, one anti-inflammatory mediator (IL-10) was significantly elevated in
ARN as compared to the controls. No association was found between the time of
sampling and the extent and levels of immune mediator expression.
Conclusions: The pathogenesis of ARN is characterized by the presence of
predominantly proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines with high expression
levels as compared to other infectious causes of uveitis. There are no
indications for an obvious Th-1 or Th-17 pathway. The combined data suggest that 
immune mediator expression is related to severity of disease, which is more
fulminant in ARN, rather than to a specific uveitis entity.
