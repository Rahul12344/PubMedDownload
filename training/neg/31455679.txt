PURPOSE: Intratumoral injection of oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGDOX induces
efficacious antiglioma immunity in syngeneic glioma mouse models. We hypothesized
that localized treatment with the virus is effective against disseminated
melanomas.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We tested the therapeutic effect of injecting Delta-24-RGDOX
into primary subcutaneous (s.c.) B16-Red-FLuc tumors in s.c./s.c. and
s.c./intracranial (i.c.) melanoma models in C57BL/6 mice. Tumor growth and in
vivo luciferase-expressing ovalbumin-specific (OT-I/Luc) T cells were monitored
with bioluminescence imaging. Cells were profiled for surface markers with flow
cytometry.
RESULTS: In both s.c./s.c. and s.c./i.c. models, 3 injections of Delta-24-RGDOX
significantly inhibited the growth of both the virus-injected s.c. tumor and
untreated distant s.c. and i.c. tumors, thereby prolonging survival. The
surviving mice were protected from rechallenging with the same tumor cells. The
virus treatment increased the presence of T cells and the frequency of effector T
cells in the virus-injected tumor and mediated the same changes in T cells from
peripheral blood, spleen, and brain hemispheres with untreated tumor. Moreover,
Delta-24-RGDOX decreased the numbers of exhausted T cells and regulatory T cells 
in the virus-injected and untreated tumors. Consequently, the virus promoted the 
in situ expansion of tumor-specific T cells and their migration to tumors
expressing the target antigen.
CONCLUSIONS: Localized intratumoral injection of Delta-24-RGDOX induces an in
situ antovaccination of the treated melanoma, the effect of which changes the
immune landscape of the treated mice, resulting in systemic immunity against
disseminated s.c. and i.c. tumors.
