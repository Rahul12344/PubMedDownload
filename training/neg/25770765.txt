OBJECTIVES: Describe the completeness and quality of Jamaica's 2008 vital
registration mortality database.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Multiple sources (hospitals, police, forensic
pathologists, Coroners courts) were used to validate deaths registered as
occurring in 2008. A 10% random sample was examined to evaluate the quality of
certification and coding. Jamaica, a middle-income country of 2.7 million, began 
vital registration in 1877; however, the mortality database was considered of
limited use, and the study was commissioned to understand the problem.
RESULTS: Of 19,286 deaths identified, 76% were registered by 31.12.2009 for
inclusion among 2008 demographic returns. Registration was highest among deaths
not requiring autopsy (94%) and lowest among Coroners cases (22%) with only 41%
of deaths among 15-44 year-olds registered. The leading causes of death were
cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and homicide. Fifteen percent were
coded to ill-defined causes of death. Recoding the sample increased mortality
from prematurity, pregnancy complications, homicide, selected cardiovascular
disorders, and human immunodeficiency virus/AIDS.
CONCLUSION: Delays registering Coroners cases, certification and coding errors,
introduced biases into the disease profile limiting the data's value in informing
clinical care. Issuance of medical certificates by pathologists who investigate
Coroners cases and training physicians and coders would eliminate most
underreporting and improve data quality.
