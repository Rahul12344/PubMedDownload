The 2013-present Western African Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is the
largest ever recorded with >28,000 reported cases. Ebola virus (EBOV) genome
sequencing has played an important role throughout this outbreak; however,
relatively few sequences have been determined from patients in Liberia, the
second worst-affected country. Here, we report 140 EBOV genome sequences from the
second wave of the Liberian outbreak and analyze them in combination with 782
previously published sequences from throughout the Western African outbreak.
While multiple early introductions of EBOV to Liberia are evident, the majority
of Liberian EVD cases are consistent with a single introduction, followed by
spread and diversification within the country. Movement of the virus within
Liberia was widespread, and reintroductions from Liberia served as an important
source for the continuation of the already ongoing EVD outbreak in Guinea.
Overall, little evidence was found for incremental adaptation of EBOV to the
human host.
