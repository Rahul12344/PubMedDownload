The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance and specificity of IgA
directed against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific early antigens (EA) for the
unequivocal diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Therefore, sera from
patients with diseases other than NPC, selected on the basis of elevated antibody
titres against EBV antigens, were compared to sera from NPC patients with regard 
to the presence of IgA directed against EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA-IgA) and
IgA directed against EA (EA-IgA). Four hundred forty-seven out of 7,508 non-NPC
sera tested showed high titres (> 512) of IgG directed against Epstein Barr viral
capsid antigen (VCA-IgG) and positive VCA-IgA (> or = 32). Two hundred
twenty-seven of these sera were compared to 51 VCA-IgA-positive sera from NPC
patients regarding the titre of EA-IgA. 60.7% of VCA-IgA-positive NPC sera showed
positive EA-IgA, however 33% of VCA-IgA-positive non-NPC patients also exhibited 
EA-IgA. This result demonstrates that EA-IgA is not specific for NPC and does not
allow an unequivocal serological diagnosis of NPC in individual cases. It seems
therefore to be of questionable use for screening programs in NPC low-risk areas.
The data do not contradict the usefulness of this marker for monitoring of
patients treated for NPC and for screening programmes in high-risk areas.
