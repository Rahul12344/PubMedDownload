Simian virus 40 (SV40) recombinants carrying the adenovirus type 12 E1A gene were
constructed. The SV40 expression vector was constructed by removing most of the
VP1 gene and an internal part of the intervening sequence for late 16S RNA and by
joining the 5' and 3' splice sites into a small segment. The adenovirus type 12
E1A gene with or without its own promoter was inserted downstream from the SV40
late promoter and the splicing junctions. The recombinant DNA was propagated and 
packaged in monkey cells by cotransfection with an early temperature-sensitive
mutant (tsA58) DNA as helper. Immunofluorescent staining of the monkey cells
infected with the resulting virus stocks showed that up to 20% of the cells
overproduced the E1A gene products in the nuclei. Two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis of the products indicated that the products were very similar or 
identical to the authentic polypeptides synthesized in adenovirus type
12-infected human embryo kidney cells. The E1A mRNA was initiated at the SV40
late promoter irrespective of the presence of the E1A promoter and terminated at 
either the E1A or the SV40 polyadenylation signal. These hybrid mRNAs were
correctly spliced in the E1A coding region.
