BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in children is becoming 
a common occurrence. Worldwide, limited studies have been done on the
mucocutaneous manifestations in HIV-positive children. The aim of our study was
to analyze the spectrum of mucocutaneous manifestations of pediatric HIV
infection and correlate to degree of immunosuppression.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: One hundred and sixty-five children under 18 years with
HIV, who presented to the departments of dermatology and pediatrics, were
examined for mucocutaneous manifestations. Patients were classified into four
groups of immunodeficiency such as normal, mild, advanced, and severe, based on
NACO guidelines of immunosuppression. The most recent CD4 count (within 6 months 
of study period) was considered.
RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-five patients were examined, and skin
manifestations were seen in 100 (61%) of them.The highest incidence of
mucocutaneous manifestations was in 6-10 age group. Papular pruritic eruptions
(PPE) (16%) was the most common condition, with highest prevalence in severe CD4 
category (38%). Molluscum contagiosum (MC) (10%) was the most common infectious
condition, with highest prevalence in advanced CD4 category (14%). Severe
cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR) caused by nevirapine were seen in three
children. The percentage of skin manifestations was highest in the advanced
(107%) and severe (100%) CD4 category. There was no significant difference in
manifestations between those who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those
not.
CONCLUSION: The percentage of skin manifestations increased with degree of CD4
depletion. PPE was found to be the hallmark of severe immunosuppression. However,
opportunistic infections did not correlate with severity of immunodeficiency.
