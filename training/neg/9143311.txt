We have assayed a variety of 7tm chemokine receptors (CCR-2b, CCR-3, CCR-4,
CCR-5, CXCR-1, CXCR-4) and two orphan 7tm receptors (V28 and EBI.1) for their
ability to allow infection of CD4-negative feline kidney CCC cells by the HIV-2
strains ROD/A and ROD/B. We found that ROD/B was able to use CXCR-4 transiently
expressed in CCC cells, and infection by ROD/A was enhanced 15-fold in the
presence of sCD4. Feline CCC cells also became permissive to ROD/B and ROD/A
entry when transiently transfected with the chemokine receptor CCR-3 or the
orphan 7tm receptor V2B, when cultured in the presence of sCD4. Entry of ROD/A
into CCC cells expressing CCR-3 could be blocked by 800 ng/ml eotaxin, the
natural ligand for CCR-3.
