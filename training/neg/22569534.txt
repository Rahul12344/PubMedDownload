VP22, encoded by the U(L)49 gene, is one of the most abundant proteins of the
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) tegument and has been shown to be important
for virus replication and spread. However, the exact role(s) played by VP22 in
the HSV-1 replication cycle have yet to be delineated. The lack of a procedure to
purify full-length VP22 has limited molecular studies on VP22 function. A
procedure was developed for the purification of soluble, full-length VP22 from
cells infected with HSV-1. A recombinant virus encoding His-tagged VP22 was
generated and found to express VP22 at levels comparable to the wild type virus
upon infection of Vero cells. By experimenting with a wide variety of cell lysis 
buffer conditions, several buffers that promote the solubility of full-length
VP22 were identified. Buffers that gave the highest levels of solubility were
then used in immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography experiments to
identify conditions that provided the greatest level of VP22 binding and recovery
from cobalt and nickel affinity resins. Using this strategy soluble, full-length 
VP22 was purified from cells infected with HSV-1.
