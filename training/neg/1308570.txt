The present report describes an alternative method for in vitro detection of
HIV-1-specific antibody secretion in 24h of culture employing as stimulant of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells the disrupted inactivated whole virus adsorbed
onto microwells in a commercial ELISA kit plates. The results obtained from this 
technique have showed high sensitivity and specificity since it was capable of
detecting HIV-1 infection early after birth. There were neither false-positivity 
nor false-negativity when blood samples obtained from HIV-1 seronegative
asymptomatic individuals, and HIV-1 seropositive adult patients were analyzed.
This rapid, low cost, simple, highly sensitive and specific assay can be
extremely useful for early diagnosis of pediatric HIV infection.
