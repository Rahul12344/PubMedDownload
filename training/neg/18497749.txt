The ring-shaped T7 helicase uses the energy of dTTP hydrolysis to perform the
mechanical work of translocation and base pair (bp) separation. We have shown
that the unwinding rate of T7 helicase decreases with increasing DNA stability.
Here, we show that the dTTPase rate also decreases with increasing DNA stability,
which indicates close linkage between chemical transition steps and translocation
steps of unwinding. We find that the force-producing step during unwinding is not
associated with dTTP binding, but dTTP hydrolysis or P(i) release. We determine
that T7 helicase extracts approximately 3.7 kcal/mol energy from dTTPase to carry
out the work of strand separation. Using this energy, T7 helicase unwinds
approximately 4 bp of AT-rich DNA or 1-2 bp of GC-rich DNA. T7 helicase therefore
adjusts both its speed and coupling ratio (bp/dTTP) to match the work of DNA
unwinding. We discuss the mechanistic implications of the variable bp/dTTP that
indicates T7 helicase either undergoes backward movements/futile hydrolysis or
unwinds DNA with a variable bp-step size; 'long and fast' steps on AT-rich and
'short and slow' steps on GC-rich DNA.
