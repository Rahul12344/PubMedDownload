OBJECTIVE: To prepare oligo microarrays for hepatitis virus detection and
genotyping.
METHODS: By analyzing the DNA or cDNA of HBV, HDV and 4 different genotypes of
HCV with the BLAST program, a group of specific sequences for the candidate
probes was specified. Array Designer 3.0 software was applied to analyze the
candidates to select probes with high specificity, identical length and similar
melting temperature (Tm). Altogether 16, 8 and 68 oligonucleotide probes were
designed for diagnosis of HBV, HDV, and genotyping HCV. Following the
synthesizing and purification, oligo probes were deposited on oligonucleotide
chips as microarrays for hepatitis virus detection and genotyping. The samples
were labeled by RD-PCR method. Hybridization results were analyzed to cross out
those probes with low specificity and sensitivity, and those with signal to noise
ratios (SNR) less than 4.0.
RESULTS: Two types of gene chips were successfully developed: microarrays for HBV
and HDV simultaneous detection and for HCV genotyping.
CONCLUSION: Using oligo probes to construct gene chips for clinical diagnosis of 
hepatitis virus is a simple and effective method. It may be widely used in
detecting hepatitis viruses and their genotyping in clinical settings.
