Murine noroviruses (MNV) are currently the most prevalent viruses infecting mouse
research colonies. Concurrent infection of research mice with these viruses can
dramatically alter the experimental outcome in some research models, but not
others. In this report, we investigated the effect of MNV1 and MNV4 on a murine
model of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis induced by Salmonella typhimurium
infection in C57BL/6 mice. Subsequent co-infection of these mice with MNV1 or
MNV4 did not lead to major changes in histopathology, the inflammatory response, 
or the fibrotic response. Thus, MNV does not substantially alter all
gastrointestinal research models, highlighting the importance of investigating
potential alterations in the research outcome by MNV on an individual basis. We
hypothesize that this is particularly important in cases of research models that 
use immunocompromised mice, which could be more sensitive to MNV
infection-induced changes.
