Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a debilitating disease
resulting from infection of oligodendrocytes by the JC polyomavirus (JCPyV).
Currently, there is no anti-viral therapeutic available against JCPyV infection. 
The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat
(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system (CRISPR/Cas9) is a genome
editing tool capable of introducing sequence specific breaks in double stranded
DNA. Here we show that the CRISPR/Cas9 system can restrict the JCPyV life cycle
in cultured cells. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to target the noncoding control region
and the late gene open reading frame of the JCPyV genome. We found significant
inhibition of virus replication and viral protein expression in cells recipient
of Cas9 together with JCPyV-specific single-guide RNA delivered prior to or after
JCPyV infection.
