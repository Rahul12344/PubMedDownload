Apple latent spherical virus (ALSV) expressing green fluorescent protein
(GFP-ALSV) was used for analysis of virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in
tobacco plants expressing GFP (GFP-tobacco). In GFP-tobacco inoculated with
GFP-ALSV, small dark spots appeared on inoculated leaves at 5 days
post-inoculation (dpi), then expanded, and finally covered the whole area of the 
leaves after 12 dpi. Most of the fluorescence of upper leaves above the 12th true
leaf disappeared at 21 dpi. Thus, GFP-ALSV infection efficiently triggered VIGS
of a transgene (GFP gene) in tobacco plants. Analysis of GFP-silenced leaves
showed that viral RNAs and proteins accumulated in all leaves where most GFP mRNA
had been degraded. The siRNAs derived from ALSV-RNAs were not detected in samples
from which siRNA of GFP mRNA could be easily detected. Direct tissue blot
analysis showed that the spread of GFP-ALSV always preceded the induction of VIGS
in infected leaves of GFP-tobacco. GFP leaf patch tests using Nicotiana
benthamiana line 16c showed that Vp20, one of the three capsid proteins, is a
silencing suppressor which interferes with systemic silencing.
