Central nervous system (CNS) - related symptoms occur in haemorrhagic fever with 
renal syndrome (HFRS). To study the CNS and ophthalmic involvement in
nephropathia epidemica (NE), the European type of HFRS, we included 26 patients
in a prospective study. Most common CNS-related symptoms were headache (96%),
insomnia (83%), vertigo (79%), nausea (79%), and vomiting (71%). Ophthalmic
symptoms were reported by 82% of patients; 41% had photophobia and 50% had
impaired vision. A transient loss of vision was recorded in one patient, who also
had a generalized seizure. Minor white matter lesions were found in about half of
the patients investigated with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Electroencephalography (EEG) showed severe alterations in only one patient, and
slight and reversible patterns in another two patients. Neopterin, interleukin-6 
and interferon-gamma levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were elevated, which
may indicate immune activation. However, we found no evidence of intrathecal NE
virus replication. We conclude that CNS-related symptoms are common in NE, and
transient ophthalmic involvement can be demonstrated in about half of the
patients.
