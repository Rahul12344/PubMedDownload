Pseudovirion-based neutralization assay is considered the gold standard method
for evaluating the immune response to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. In
this study, we developed a multicolor neutralization assay to simultaneously
detect the neutralizing antibodies against different HPV types. FluoroSpot was
used to interpret the fluorescent protein expression instead of flow cytometry.
The results of FluoroSpot and flow cytometry showed good consistency, with RÂ² >
0.98 for the log-transformed IC50 values. Regardless of the reporter color, the
single-, dual-, and triple-color neutralization assays reported identical results
for the same samples. In low-titer samples from naturally HPV-infected
individuals, there was strong agreement between the single- and triple-color
assays, with kappa scores of 0.92, 0.89, and 0.96 for HPV16, HPV18, and HPV58,
respectively. Good reproducibility was observed for the triple-color assay, with 
coefficients of variation of 2.0%-41.5% within the assays and 8.3%-36.2% between 
the assays. Three triple-color systems, HPV16-18-58, HPV6-33-45, and HPV11-31-52,
were developed that could evaluate the immunogenicity of a nonavalent vaccine in 
three rounds of the assay. With the advantages of an easy-to-use procedure and
less sample consumption, the multiple-color assay is more suitable than classical
assays for large sero-epidemiological studies and clinical trials and is more
amenable to automation.
