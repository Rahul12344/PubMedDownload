The mystique of the herpesviruses.

St Geme JW Jr.

Probing the biologic mystique of the herpesvirus family, we find elements of
antigenic similarity, the capacity of virions to persist within our cells in
complete form, and the potential at some later time for these virions to undergo 
renewed replication. A venereal mode of transmission from one host to another may
be characteristic of some of these viruses. Similar patterns of illness may be
produced by several of the herpesviruses. Within the cellular framework of
inflammation and necrosis which infective virus may evoke in the host, there may 
also reside the capability of neoplastic transformation.
