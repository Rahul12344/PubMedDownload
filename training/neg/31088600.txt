BackgroundA steady increase in HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) has been demonstrated 
globally in individuals initiating first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). To
support effective use of ART and prevent spread of HIVDR, monitoring is
essential.AimWe piloted a surveillance system for transmitted HIVDR to assess the
feasibility of implementation at the European level.MethodAll 31 countries in the
European Union and European Economic Area were invited to retrospectively submit 
data on individuals newly diagnosed with HIV in 2015 who were tested for
antiviral susceptibility before ART, either as case-based or as aggregate data.
We used the Stanford HIV database algorithm to translate genetic sequences into
levels of drug resistance.ResultsNine countries participated, with six reporting 
case-based data on 1,680 individuals and four reporting aggregated data on 1,402 
cases. Sequence data were available for 1,417 cases: 14.5% of individuals
(n = 244) showed resistance to at least one antiretroviral drug. In case-based
surveillance, the highest levels of transmitted HIVDR were observed for
non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) with resistance detected
in 8.6% (n = 145), followed by resistance to nucleoside reverse-transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTI) (5.1%; n = 85) and protease inhibitors (2.0%;
n = 34).ConclusionWe conclude that standard reporting of HIVDR data was feasible 
in the participating countries. Legal barriers for data sharing, consensus on
definitions and standardisation of interpretation algorithms should be clarified 
in the process of enhancing European-wide HIV surveillance with drug resistance
information.
