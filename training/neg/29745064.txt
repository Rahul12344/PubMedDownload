The molecular basis for the inhibitory action of a benzimidazole inhibitor
compound to hepatitis C virus E1 envelope protein was examined computationally.
Structures for the wild-type E1 protein and seven mutants were modelled using an 
ab initio protein structure prediction algorithm, and these models were docked
with the benzimidazole inhibitor. Top-ranked conformers for each docked structure
were examined in the context of the putative function of the inhibitor that
blocks fusion of the envelope protein to the host cells. The results for the
wild-type protein and that for a series of mutants containing reported single,
double and triple resistance mutations demonstrate that the inhibitor binds in
the vicinity of residue Phe99 (at position 291 in the encoded polyprotein) at the
C-terminal end of a putative fusion domain. In so doing, the compound inhibits
the virus from fusing to host cells and blocks viral replication in accord with
the results from cell-based infection studies.
