BACKGROUND AND AIM: Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has particular
advantages for Turkey where hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the most common 
cause of cirrhosis, both because LDLT circumvents the difficulties encountered in
the emerging world in providing deceased donor organs, and because it allows
preemptive antiviral therapy. The aim of this study was to review one
institution's experience with LDLT in patients with chronic HBV infection.
METHODS: A total of 109 patients with chronic HBV infection underwent LDLT
between September 1999 and June 2005, of whom 40 were coinfected with hepatitis D
virus and 23 had hepatocellular carcinoma. Antiviral prophylaxis was attempted in
all, beginning prior to transplantation with lamivudine or adefovir, and
continuing after transplantation with low dose intramuscular hyperimmune B
immunoglobulin (HBIg) plus lamivudine or adefovir.
RESULTS: In a median follow up of 20 months (range 1-66 months), there was no
donor mortality. One-year recipient survival was 90%, and in total 16 recipients 
died. None of the deaths was related to HBV. Recurrence of HBV infection was
detected by reappearance of serum hepatitis B surface antigen in six patients
(5.5%) at 5, 8, 12, 17, 34 and 46 months after transplantation, respectively.
There was no influence of donor hepatitis B core antibody status on the
likelihood of recurrence of HBV in the allograft.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that LDLT with antiviral treatment and low dose 
HBIg provides excellent results for donors and recipients.
