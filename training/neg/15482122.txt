Transfusion-transmission of viral infections, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus, 
were once the scourge of blood transfusion. However, due to remarkable progress
over the last 30 years, tests for viral proteins, antibody responses and more
recently, viral nucleic acids, have virtually eliminated these risks. This review
summarizes these advances in an historical context, describes new methodologies
on the horizon, and discusses residual infectious risks associated with blood
transfusion.
