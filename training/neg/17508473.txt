A case of a false-positive result of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
confirmatory immunoblot-based assay is described. Repeatedly borderline reactive 
anti-HIV screening enzyme immunoassay result obtained in a local hospital
resulted in directing the sample to the Slovenian HIV/AIDS Reference Laboratory. 
In the Reference Laboratory, both anti-HIV screening assays and confirmatory
Western blot were negative, while a confirmatory test INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score
(Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium) was anti-HIV-1 positive due to sgp120 and gp41
reactivity. The results of serological testing of the second sample obtained
three weeks later were completely identical, while in the third sample obtained 5
months later, seroreversion was observed. Due to a negative dynamics in anti-HIV 
serological profile and repeatedly negative results of the molecular tests for
HIV-1 and HIV-2, HIV infection was excluded and the results of test INNO-LIA HIV 
I/II Score were finally interpreted as false positive.
