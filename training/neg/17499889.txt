A series of 1-isopropylsulfonyl-2-amine benzimidazole derivatives were
synthesized and evaluated for their anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) activity and
cytotoxicity in the HepG2.2.15 cell line. In general, these derivatives are
potent HBV inhibitors (IC(50)<4 microM) with high selectivity indices (SIs>40).
Compounds 5b-e, g, j, and 9a were among the most prominent compounds, with
IC(50)s of 0.70-2.0 microM and SIs of 41-274. The potent anti-HBV activity and
safety profiles of the most promising compounds 5d and j (IC(50)s=0.70 microM,
SIs>120) demonstrate the potential of this series of benzimidazoles for the
development of new anti-HBV drugs.
