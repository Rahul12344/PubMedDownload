Despite the unprecedented Ebola virus outbreak response in West Africa, no Ebola 
medical countermeasures have been approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration. However, multiple valuable lessons have been learned about the
conduct of clinical research in a resource-poor, high risk-pathogen setting.
Numerous therapeutics were explored or developed during the outbreak, including
repurposed drugs, nucleoside and nucleotide analogues (BCX4430, brincidofovir,
favipiravir, and GS-5734), nucleic acid-based drugs (TKM-Ebola and AVI-7537), and
immunotherapeutics (convalescent plasma and ZMapp). We review Ebola therapeutics 
progress in the aftermath of the West Africa Ebola virus outbreak and attempt to 
offer a glimpse of a path forward.
