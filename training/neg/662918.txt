Photoreactive probes for high resolution mapping of membrane proteins.

Iwata KK, Manweiler CA, Bramhall J, Wisnieski BJ.

The preparation and characterization of a novel series of radioactively labeled
membrane probes is described. These probes are carbohydrate derivatives of fatty 
acids which contain a photosensitive azide moiety at a specified distance along
the alkyl chain. The function of the carbohydrate group is to restrict the azide 
function to the outer surface monolayer of sealed membrane systems. The azide
probes have been used in several well-characterized membrane systems including
erythrocyte ghosts, membrane-enveloped viruses, and artificial vesicles. Upon
activation, the probes attach to integral proteins to form a stable, covalent
complex which may be extracted and identified. The activation protocol is
outlined and some of the preliminary results are discussed.
