Bacteriophages may be useful as surrogates for animal viruses when the virucidal 
properties of different photosensitizing compounds are initially investigated. We
studied photoinactivation of four bacteriophages, phi X174, T7, PRD1, and phi 6, 
by the dye merocyanine 540 (MC540) (15 micrograms/mL). Merocyanine 540 (MC540)
should be most effective with lipid-containing viruses, since it is primarily
lipophilic (but also binds to proteins). Two of the phages, PRD1 and phi 6
contain lipid, with only phi 6 having an external lipoprotein envelope. Filtered 
radiation (450-600 nm) from a 750 W projector was used at 16-100 W/m2. The
survival curves of the different viruses clearly demonstrated different levels of
sensitivity to photoinactivation by MC540, with phi 6 (Do = 1.5 kJ/m2) being the 
most sensitive, followed by T7 (21-fold less sensitive). While both PRD1 and phi 
6 have lipid components, only phi 6 was photoinactivated by MC540. Thus the
internal lipid components of PRD1 were not sufficient to allow photoinactivation 
by this dye, at fluences up to 300 kJ/m2. For comparison, we also
photoinactivated Herpes simplex virus (Do = 0.053 kJ/m2) and found it to be
28-fold more sensitive than phi 6 to photoinactivation by the same concentration 
of MC540. Thus phi 6 may be used as a surrogate for enveloped human viruses for
photoinactivation by lipophilic dyes, but the results may only be useful
qualitatively.
