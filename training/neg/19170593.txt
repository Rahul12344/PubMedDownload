Transactivator protein C of bacteriophage mu is essential for the transition from
middle to late gene expression during the phage life cycle. The unusual,
multistep activation of mom promoter (P(mom)) by C protein involves
activator-mediated promoter unwinding to recruit RNA polymerase and subsequent
enhanced promoter clearance of the enzyme. To achieve this, C binds its site
overlapping the -35 region of the mom promoter with a very high affinity, in
Mg(2+)-dependent fashion. Mg(2+)-mediated conformational transition in C is
necessary for its DNA binding and transactivation. We have determined the
residues in C which coordinate Mg(2+), to induce allosteric transition in the
protein, required for the specific interaction with DNA. Residues E26 and D40 in 
the putative metal binding motif (E(26)X(10)D(37)X(2)D(40)) present toward the
N-terminus of the protein are found to be important for Mg(2+) ion binding.
Mutations in these residues lead to altered Mg(2+)-induced conformation,
compromised DNA binding, and reduced levels of transcription activation. Although
Mg(2+) is widely used in various DNA transaction reactions, this report provides 
the first insights on the importance of the metal ion-induced allosteric
transitions in regulating transcription factor function.
