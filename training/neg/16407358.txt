Dengue virus-2 (DENV-2) RNA was quantified from the midgut and legs of individual
Aedes aegypti at each of 14 days postinfectious blood meal (dpi) in a DENV-2
susceptible strain from Chetumal, Mexico. A SYBR Green I based strand-specific,
quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
assay was developed. The lower detection and quantitation limits were 20 and 200 
copies per reaction, respectively. Amounts of positive and negative strand viral 
RNA strands were correlated. Numbers of plaque-forming units (PFU) were
correlated with DENV-2 RNA copy number in both C6/36 cell cultures and
mosquitoes. PFU were consistently lower than RNA copy number by 2-3 log(10).
Midgut levels of DENV-2 RNA peaked 8 dpi and fluctuated erratically between 6 and
9 dpi. Copies of DENV-2 RNA varied significantly among infected mosquitoes at
each time point. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR is a convenient and reliable
method that provides new insights into virus-vector interactions.
