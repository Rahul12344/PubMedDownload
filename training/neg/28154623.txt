INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among females
in Angola and human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main risk factor for the
development of pre-cancerous squamous intraepithelial lesions. The diversity and 
frequency of HPV types in Angola has yet to be reported.
AIM: To determine the frequency of HPV among women with squamous intraepithelial 
lesions from women in Luanda, Angola.
METHODS: Study participants included women diagnosed with cytological
abnormalities that voluntarily provided Pap smears (n = 64). Genomic DNA was
extracted from the samples for use as templates in the PCR amplification of HPV
sequences. PCR products were sequenced to determine HPV type.
RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 71.9% (46/64) in the samples. A higher diversity
of HPV types was found in the cytological lesions, such as ASCUS and LSIL (HPV16,
6, 18, 31, 58, 66, 70 and 82, in order of frequency) than that detected for HSIL 
and SSC (HPV16, 18, 6 and 33). The most prevalent HPV type were: HPV16, HPV6 and 
HPV18.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report on HPV type diversity and frequency in woman
of Angola. The results suggest that large-scale studies across Africa would
improve our understanding of interrelationship between HPV infections and
cervical cancer. More directly, the identification of the HPV types most
prevalent suggests that women in Angola would benefit from currently available
HPV vaccines.
