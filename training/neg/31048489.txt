Mutationally constrained epitopes of variable pathogens represent promising
targets for vaccine design but are not reliably identified by sequence
conservation. In this study, we employed structure-based network analysis, which 
applies network theory to HIV protein structure data to quantitate the
topological importance of individual amino acid residues. Mutation of residues at
important network positions disproportionately impaired viral replication and
occurred with high frequency in epitopes presented by protective human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) class I alleles. Moreover, CD8+ T cell targeting of highly
networked epitopes distinguished individuals who naturally control HIV, even in
the absence of protective HLA alleles. This approach thereby provides a
mechanistic basis for immune control and a means to identify CD8+ T cell epitopes
of topological importance for rational immunogen design, including a T cell-based
HIV vaccine.
