An increased cellular Ca2+ content has been associated with Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD). However, estimates of the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]i) in cells of DMD patients were not available. We compared the [Ca2+]i
levels of normal and DMD peripheral blood lymphocytes and Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed lymphoblasts using the novel probe, quin 2, an internally
trapped fluorescent indicator. The [Ca2+]i levels of normal and DMD cells were
not significantly different.
