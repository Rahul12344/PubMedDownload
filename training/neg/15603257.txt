Cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions of the genital tract are a major threat
to the health of women worldwide. Introduction of screening tests to detect
cervical cancer precursor lesions has reduced cervical cancer rates in the
developed world, but not in developing countries. Approximately 80% of the
470,000 cervical cancer cases diagnosed worldwide each year occur in developing
countries. Despite advances in treatment of cervical cancer, about half of the
women with the disease will die. Over the last 20 years, several lines of
scientific investigation have identified oncogenic human papillomaviruses as
etiological agents for cervical cancer, and have led to the development of
prophylactic vaccines against this disease.
