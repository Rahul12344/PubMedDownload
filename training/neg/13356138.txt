Effect on immunity to challenge and antibody response of variation in dosage
schedule of rabies vaccine in mice.

HABEL K.

Groups of mice were immunized with the same total quantity of an ultraviolet
irradiated killed virus vaccine given in varying numbers of divided doses spaced 
at varying time intervals. All mice were bled just before being challenged by
intracerebral inoculation of fixed virus and the sera tested for level of
neutralizing antibodies. All dosage schedules produced immunity and good antibody
levels. Twelve daily doses of vaccine gave no better results than the same amount
of vaccine divided into 3 or 4 doses. A dose of vaccine at or after the 10th day 
from the start of immunization seemed to act as a "booster" to the primary
response to the earlier doses.
