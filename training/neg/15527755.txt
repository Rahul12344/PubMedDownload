Excisionase (Xis) is an accessory protein that is required for the site-specific 
excision reaction of the coliphages HK022 and lambda. Xis binds in a strong
cooperative manner to two tandem binding sites (X1 and X2) located on the P arm
of the attachment (att) sites on the phage genome. As a result of crosslinking
experiments in vivo and in vitro of Xis-overexpressing cells, by gel filtration
of purified Xis and by FRET analyses we show that Xis monomers of HK022 interact 
and form dimers that are not dependent on the single Cys residue of the protein
and on the presence of DNA. The formation of the dimers may explain the strong
binding cooperativity of Xis to its sites on DNA.
