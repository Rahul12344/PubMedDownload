Experiments are in progress to engineer herpes simplex virus type 1 as a gene
transfer vector for the nervous system. This virus is well suited for this
purpose due to its ability to persist for long periods in a latent state in
neurons wherein lytic genes are inactive and a unique viral promoter is capable
of inducing transcription from the latent viral genome. The virus can be highly
cytotoxic for neurons, however, and thus genes which initiate the lytic cycle
must be deleted from the genome in order to force the virus into latency.
Candidate genes include the immediately early functions ICP0, ICP27, ICP4 and the
virus host shut-off function. The design of a suitable promoter regulator capable
of expressing foreign genes during latency must also be developed. Many promoters
including strong viral promoters and neuronal-specific cellular promoters have
proved to be inadequate due to the transient nature of their activity from the
viral vector genome and the viral latency promoter region appears to be weakly
active in brain. Current efforts concern the development of auto-regulatable
promoters which can remain active even if the viral genome is bound by chromatin.
