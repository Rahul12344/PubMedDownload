Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) has several clinical presentations and has
been reported in various states of immune deregulation. We report the unique
presentation of this disease as a pigmented periungual macule in a patient with a
previous history of immune deregulation related to cutaneous lymphoma. A
literature review did not reveal any previous reports of EV in patients with
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
