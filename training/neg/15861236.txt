Most reports from the United States suggest Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes
feed minimally on humans. Given the abundance of C. quinquefasciatus in
residential Tucson and parts of metropolitan Phoenix, and the arrival of West
Nile virus to this area, discovering the blood meal hosts of the local population
is important. Using a sandwich ELISA technique, the local C. quinquefasciatus
were found to feed on both humans and birds. This suggests they should be
considered potential West Nile virus vectors.
