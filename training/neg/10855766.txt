Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is frequently shed after infection of the genital or
perianal area. HSV shedding, as determined by culture, occurs on about 3% of days
for immunocompetent women and men, and more for persons with HIV infection or if 
measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most horizontal and vertical
transmission of HSV occurs during unrecognized or asymptomatic shedding, and the 
majority of HSV-2-infected persons are unaware of their infection. Many persons
with 'asymptomatic' HSV-2 infection can learn to recognize genital signs and
symptoms as recurrences of HSV-2 infection. However, some shedding episodes
remain truly asymptomatic even after patient education. Antiviral therapy
dramatically reduces asymptomatic shedding, and trials to evaluate its effect on 
HSV transmission are underway.
