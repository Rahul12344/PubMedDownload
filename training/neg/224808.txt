Preliminary studies of the mode of action of arildone, a novel antiviral agent.

Kuhrt MF, Fancher MJ, Jasty V, Pancic F, Came PE.

Arildone (also known as Win 38020), a novel aryl diketone, inhibited replication 
of herpes simplex virus type 2 in tissue culture by interfering with an event
that occurs prior to 6 h postinfection. The inhibition could be partially
reversed by washing. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, neither
viral deoxyribonucleic acid nor viral proteins were synthesized in the presence
of arildone.
