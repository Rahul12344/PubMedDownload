Measles virus genome in infections of the central nervous system.

Haase AT, Swoveland P, Stowring L, Ventura P, Johnson KP, Norrby E, Gibbs CJ Jr.

The measles virus genome was traced in acute and chronic infections of the
central nervous system in hamsters and humans. The extent of viral replication
and gene expression was assessed by the techniques of in situ hybridization and
immunofluorescence. Both replication and gene expression were restricted in
chronically infected hamsters and in humans with subacute sclerosing
panencephalitis. It is proposed that restriction plays an important role in
persistence of measles virus and the slow evolution of disease in these and other
slow infections.
