Genetically distinct hantaviruses have been identified in five species of
fossorial moles (order Eulipotyphla, family Talpidae) from Eurasia and North
America. Here, we report the isolation and partial characterization of a highly
divergent hantavirus, named Nova virus (NVAV), from lung tissue of a European
mole (Talpa europaea), captured in central Poland in August 2013. Typical
hantavirus-like particles, measuring 80-120 nm in diameter, were found in
NVAV-infected Vero E6 cells by transmission electron microscopy. Whole-genome
sequences of the isolate, designated NVAV strain Te34, were identical to that
amplified from the original lung tissue, and phylogenetic analysis of the
full-length L, M and S segments, using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods,
showed that NVAV was most closely related to hantaviruses harbored by
insectivorous bats, consistent with an ancient evolutionary origin. Infant Swiss 
Webster mice, inoculated with NVAV by the intraperitoneal route, developed weight
loss and hyperactivity, beginning at 16 days, followed by hind-limb paralysis and
death. High NVAV RNA copies were detected in lung, liver, kidney, spleen and
brain by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Neuropathological examination showed
astrocytic and microglial activation and neuronal loss. The first mole-borne
hantavirus isolate will facilitate long-overdue studies on its infectivity and
pathogenic potential in humans.
