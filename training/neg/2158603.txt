We report five patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in
stages IV-C1, IV-C2 and IV-D who developed peripheral polyneuropathy (PNP). Two
patients had invalidating PNP with a demyelinating predominance, while in the
remaining three axonal component predominated. However, both components were
present in different degrees in all patients. We have observed two cases with
transition from one type of PNP to the other during the course of the disease.
Inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy usually develops in the initial stages of the
infection, while the distal axonal type is more commonly seen in patients with
advanced infection. The possibility that PNP could have, in these patients, a
common etiology and pathogenesis with variable clinical and electrophysiological 
expression is discussed.
