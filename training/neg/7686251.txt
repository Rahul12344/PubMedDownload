Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-I) reverse transcriptase was expressed in E.
coli and purified to homogeneity (E. coli strain RRI (pRC-RT, pRK 248cIts)). We
have investigated the substrate properties toward to DNA synthesis, catalyzed by 
this enzyme, of some nucleoside-5'-triphosphate analogues, previously studied in 
the same reactions, catalyzed by AMV and M-MLV reverse transcriptases. We have
investigated substrate properties of new analogues of
2',3'-dideoxy-2',3'-didehydro- and 2',3'-dideoxytubercidin-5'-triphosphates. We
have compared the relative efficiency of incorporation of different analogues
tested in the DNA chain. It has been shown that expressed and purified HIV
reverse transcriptase had the same specificity to analogues of
2'-deoxyribonucleoside-5'-triphosphates as was described for reverse
transcriptases and natural HIV reverse transcriptase as well. These properties
allow to apply the expressed HIV reverse transcriptase in different model
systems.
