After the recent description of biphasic disease with herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
encephalitis followed by anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis
(anti-NMDARE), anti-NMDARE preceded by non-HSV central nervous system (CNS)
infection has been more rarely reported. We report the first case of TBE followed
by anti-NMDARE and carry out a systematic literature review on anti-NMDARE
preceded by non-HSV CNS infection.
