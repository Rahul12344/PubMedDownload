We evaluated the use of COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 for highly pure system (COBAS TaqMan) 
recently developed as a second-generation quantification of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA. The linearity, sensitivity,
reproducibility, and effects of possibly interfering materials were examined and 
results compared to those of AMPLICOR HIV-1 MONITOR Test version 1.5 (AMPLICOR)
using 6 virus isolates that were all different subtypes. Excellent linearity was 
obtained at 1.67 x 10(2)-1.73 x 10(6) copies/mL (r2 = 0.991). Sensitivity was 40 
copies/mL at a 100% hit rate. Intraexperimental CVs were 27.4-50.8%, and
interexperimental CVs were 29.3-81.5%. Although COBAS TaqMan showed an excellent 
titer correlation with AMPLICOR (r2 = 0.960), mean titer obtained with COBAS
TaqMan was 3.1 times higher than that with AMPLICOR (p = 0.002), and 7.1 times
higher in a sample of subtype C, suggesting discrepancies in HIV-1 RNA
quantification between the two kits. This point should be noted when AMPLICOR is 
replaced by COBAS TaqMan.
