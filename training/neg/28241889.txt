BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to explore novel biomarkers that
can predict the clinical outcome of patients before treatment or during
vaccination. These would be useful for the selection of appropriate patients who 
would be expected to exhibit better treatment outcomes from vaccination, and for 
facilitating the development of cancer vaccine treatments.
METHODS: From a single-arm, non-randomized, human leukocyte antigen
(HLA)-A-status-blind phase II trial of a vaccine treatment using three
HLA-A*2402-restricted peptides for advanced pancreatic cancer (PC), we obtained
peripheral blood samples from 36 patients of an HLA-A*2402-matched group and 27
patients of an HLA-A*2402-unmatched group.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis (HR = 2.546; 95% CI = 1.138 to 5.765; p = 0.0231) 
and log-rank test (p = 0.0036) showed that a high expression level of programmed 
death-1 (PD-1) on CD4+ T cells was a negative predictive biomarker of overall
survival in the HLA-A*2402-matched group . Moreover, a high expression level of
PD-1 on CD4+ T cells was a negative predictor for the induction of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (p = 0.0007). After treatment, we found that the upregulation of PD-1
and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3) expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was
significantly associated with a poor clinical outcome in the HLA-A*2402-matched
group (p = 0.0330, 0.0282, 0.0046, and 0.0068, respectively). In contrast, there 
was no significant difference for these factors in the HLA-A*2402-unmatched
group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the upregulation of PD-1 and Tim-3
expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may restrict T cell responses in advanced PC 
patients; therefore, combination immunotherapy with blockade of PD-1 and Tim-3 to
restore T cell responses may be a potential therapeutic approach for advanced PC 
patients.
