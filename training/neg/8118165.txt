Far and away the most common fungal infection associated with HIV infection is
candidiasis. This tends to produce mucosal topical infections and local treatment
may be enough to control them. Generally we prefer courses of 1-2 weeks rather
than chronic suppression, for fear of eliciting overgrowth of resistant isolates.
Fluconazole resistant Candida species may be an increasing problem over the next 
decade. For cryptococcoses the problem is both simpler and more complicated.
Fluconazole is highly effective for chronic suppression, but not very effective
for initial therapy. Here a short course of amphotericin B, just 2 weeks in
length, is followed by chronic azole suppression. Fluconazole appears excellent, 
but itraconazole may also be effective. For histoplasmosis itraconazole appears
to be the most advantageous drug, with excellent clinical response within 2
weeks. A role for fluconazole is unclear. Coccidioidomycosis is uncommon, but
difficult. I cannot offer any suggestions on "ideal" therapy here. Other
diseases, such as aspergillosis, are extremely uncommon but still are AIDS
associated mycoses. It is my personal fear that as we go along identifying the
AIDS virus and its complications, aspergillosis and zygomycosis may establish
themselves as the future "black hats" for which we will need to pull something
out of the "box". What to pull is not very clear.
