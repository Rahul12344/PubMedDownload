1965.-Thin sections of filterable hemolytic anemia agent of rat, now identified
as Haemobartonella muris, revealed (i) that the agent is spherical or ellipsoidal
and 350 to 700 mmu in size, (ii) that it has a single limiting membrane enclosing
granules and some filaments (neither cell wall nor nucleoid was found), and (iii)
that it is found preferentially at the surface and sometimes within the
cytoplasmic vacuoles of erythrocytes in the circulating blood and bone marrow,
and multiplies there through binary fission. No specific structure suggestive of 
motility was found. From the morphological point of view, Eperythrozoon coccoides
was found to be very similar to H. muris, whereas Mycoplasma pulmonis, also
covered with a single limiting membrane, differs in its pleomorphism and
multiplication. These and some other microorganisms taxonomically between
bacteria and viruses were compared morphologically, and their possible
classification is discussed.
