Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a tumorigenic human Î³-herpesvirus, which produces
several known structured RNAs with functional importance: two are implicated in
latency maintenance and tumorigenic phenotypes, EBER1 and EBER2; a viral small
nucleolar RNA (v-snoRNA1) that may generate a small regulatory RNA; and an
internal ribosomal entry site in the EBNA1 mRNA. A recent bioinformatics and
RNA-Seq study of EBV identified two novel EBV non-coding (nc)RNAs with
evolutionary conservation in lymphocryptoviruses and likely functional
importance. Both RNAs are transcribed from a repetitive region of the EBV genome 
(the W repeats) during a highly oncogenic type of viral latency. One novel ncRNA 
can form a massive (586 nt) hairpin, while the other RNA is generated from a
short (81 nt) intron and is found in high abundance in EBV-infected cells.
