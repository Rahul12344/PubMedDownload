Specific, high affinity binding macromolecules are of great importance for
biomedical and biotechnological applications. The most popular classical
antibody-based molecules have recently been challenged by alternative scaffolds
with desirable biophysical properties. Phage display technology applied to such
scaffolds allows generation of potent affinity reagents by in vitro selection.
Here, we report identification and characterization of a novel helical
polypeptide with advantageous biophysical properties as a template for
construction of phage display libraries. A three-helix bundle structure, based on
Measles virus phosphoprotein P shows a very favourable stability and solubility
profile. We designed, constructed and characterized six different types of phage 
display libraries based on the proposed template. Their functional size of over
10(9) independent clones, balanced codon bias and decent display level are key
parameters attesting to the quality and utility of the libraries. The new
libraries are a promising tool for isolation of high affinity binders based on a 
small helical scaffold which could become a convenient alternative to antibodies.
