Biliary atresia (BA) is a progressive fibro-inflammatory pediatric liver disease 
in which osteopontin (OPN), a glycoprotein with inflammatory and fibrogenic
activity, may play a pathogenic role. The current studies were conducted in a
mouse model of rotavirus-induced BA to test the hypotheses that live but not
inactivated rotavirus causes antigenemia, upregulation of hepatic OPN expression,
and induction of BA and fibrosis; and that OPN is necessary for development of
BA. Prolonged or transient antigenemia developed in mice inoculated with live or 
inactivated virus, respectively, but only live virus upregulated hepatic OPN and 
caused BA and fibrosis. OPN was expressed in intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts
in healthy mice and in mice with BA. OPN-deficient mice, similar to WT mice,
developed BA. Together, these data show that live but not inactivated rotavirus
causes upregulation of hepatic OPN expression and BA but that OPN is not
necessary for development of BA.
