Interleukin (IL)-22+CD4+T (Th22) cells play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of 
autoimmune diseases and infectious diseases, although the role of Th22 cells
remains largely unclear in children with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD)
caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71). This study aims to explore the role of
circulating IL-22+IL-17A-CD4+T (cTh22) cells in children with EV71-associated
HFMD. We found that during the acute stage of illness, the frequencies of cTh22
and circulating IL-22+IL-17A+CD4+T (IL-22+cTh17) cells in CD4+T cells infrom
affected patients, and especially in severely affected patients, were
significantly higher than in healthy controls (HC). The major source of IL-22
production was cTh22 cells, partially from cTh17 cells. Moreover, the protein and
mRNA levels of IL-22, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF-α were significantly different
among the mild patients, severe patients and HC, as well as AHR and RORγt mRNA
levels. A positive correlation was found between plasma IL-22 levels and cTh22
cell frequencies, and cTh17 cell and IL-22+ cTh17 cell frequencies. Furthermore, 
the frequencies of cTh22 were significantly decreased in the convalescent
patients. Our findings indicated that cTh22 cells could play critical roles in
the pathogenesis of EV71 infection, and are potential therapeutic targets for
patients with EV71-associated HFMD.
