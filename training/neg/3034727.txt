synthesized ends of bacteriophage Mu.

We describe below the chemical synthesis of the right and left ends of
bacteriophage Mu and characterize the activity of these synthetic ends in mini-Mu
transposition. Mini-Mu plasmids were constructed which carry the synthetic Mu
ends together with the Mu A and B genes under control of the bacteriophage lambda
pL promoter. Derepression of pL leads to a high frequency of mini-Mu
transposition (5.6 X 10(-2) which is dependent on the presence of the Mu ends and
the Mu A and B proteins. Five deletion mutants in the Mu ends were tested in the 
mini-Mu transposition system and their effects on transposition are described.
