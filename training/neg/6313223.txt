RNP template of vesicular stomatitis virus regulates transcription and
replication functions.

Perrault J, Clinton GM, McClure MA.

Small leader RNAs, copied from the extreme 3' ends of the minus and plus strands 
of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) genome, are thought to play a central
role in the regulation of viral transcription and replication. We describe here a
novel class of VSV mutants, denoted pol R, in which termination at leader sites
in vitro is specifically suppressed. We have assayed for the presence of leader
RNAs and readthrough transcripts in reaction products from standard virion
templates (plus leader) and defective interfering particle templates (minus
leader). In both cases, mutant virions gave rise to a much higher proportion of
readthrough transcripts than wild type (greater than 80% vs approximately 10%).
Reconstitution experiments with separated ribonucleoprotein (RNP) templates and
polymerase protein fractions revealed, surprisingly, that the N protein moiety of
the RNP template was responsible for readthrough. This conclusion was further
supported by protein analyses that showed a similar charge change in the N
protein of two independently isolated pol R VSV mutants. These results lead us to
propose that modification of the N protein may regulate termination at leader RNA
sites.
