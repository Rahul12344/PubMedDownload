Recently, we identified a putative prophage on a genomic island (GI) within the
genome sequence of Francisella hispaniensis isolate AS0-814 (Francisella
tularensis subsp. novicida-like 3523) by the analysis of the CRISPR-Cas systems
of Francisella. Various spacer DNAs within the CRISPR region of different F.
tularensis subsp. novicida strains were found to be homologous to the putative
prophage (Schunder et al., 2013, Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 303:51-60). Now we
identified the GI (FhaGI-1) as a mobile element which is able to form a circular 
episomal structure. The circular episomal form of FhaGI-1 is generated by F.
hispaniensis, and the excision of the island is an integrase-dependent and
site-specific process. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that the excision of the
island is also possible in other bacterial species (Escherichia coli). In
addition, we could show that a genetically generated small variant of the island 
is also functional and, after its electroporation into strain F. tularensis
subsp. holarctica LVS, the GI was stable and site-specifically integrated into
the genome of the transformants. The integrase is sufficient for the integration 
and excision of the small variant into and from the DNA backbone, respectively.
Thus, the element may be suitable to be used as a genetic tool in F. tularensis
research. Furthermore, we identified the tRNA(Val) gene of Francisella as an
integration site for GIs. Genomic island FphGI-1 was identified in Francisella
philomiragia ATCC 25016. We were not able to detect the episomal form of this GI,
probably due to a mutated attR site. However, we could demonstrate that
integrative GIs are present in Francisella and that they may allow horizontal
gene transfer between different Francisella species.
