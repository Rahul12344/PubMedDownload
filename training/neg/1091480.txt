Entomopathogens as insecticides.

Ignoffo CM.

Entomopathogens, diseases of insects, are suggested as a possible new generation 
of safe, selective insecticides. Over a thousand pathogens have been isolated
from insects. Many of these, associated with major insect pests, are potential
candidates for development into microbial insecticides. Phases in the development
of a microbial insecticide are discussed as well as factors (production, safety, 
efficacy, registration, non-technical) which may influence this development.
