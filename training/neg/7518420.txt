To study the mechanism(s) responsible for the appearance of Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-induced anti-histone autoantibodies, peripheral blood B lymphocytes from
healthy donors were infected with EBV and the resulting lymphoblastoid cell lines
were tested for secretion of antibodies reacting with histones. It was found that
EBV-transformed cells produce IgM antibody reactive with histones and that the
frequency of EBV-inducible circulating B lymphocytes that produce antibodies to
histones is at least 10(-5). Moreover, in cultures of tonsillar lymphoid cells,
the enrichment in CD5+ B lymphocytes increases the percentage of EBV-transformed 
cultures making anti-histone IgM antibodies. EBV may therefore, also in vivo,
induce natural anti-histone antibody by polyclonal B-cell activation without any 
requirement of antigen to trigger antibody response.
