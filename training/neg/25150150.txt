Hepatitis B virus (HBV) continues to be a serious worldwide health problem
despite the use of protective HBV vaccines and therapeutic regimens against
chronic HBV infection. Chronic HBV patients cannot induce sufficient immune
responses against the virus. HBV and its antigens are believed to suppress immune
responses during chronic infection. Hence, studying the role of HBV in immune
suppression is very important for the development of alternative therapeutic
strategies for HBV infections. In the present study, we investigated the effect
of Hepatitis B virus e antigen (HBeAg) on the generation of bone marrow derived
dendritic cells (BMDCs) and the stimulation of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). In the
presence of HBeAg, the ratio of BMDCs was decreased, but the ratio of
CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) immature myeloid cells was increased. The expression of 47
proteins was also changed during HBeAg treatment; however, CpG-induced MHC-II
expression on pDCs was not affected. Our results indicate that HBeAg may have a
negative effect on the generation of DCs from bone morrow precursors.
