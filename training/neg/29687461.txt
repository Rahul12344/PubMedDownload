Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare but more lethal cutaneous cancer than
melanoma. However, spontaneous regression of a number of MCC has been reported,
although the cause of this regression remains unclear. In most cases, MCC
regresses after a surgical procedure, for example, biopsy. Herein, we report a
case of Merkel cell polyomavirus-negative MCC coincident with squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) that underwent true spontaneous regression without biopsy. One
month after the patient's first visit, clinical examination revealed that the
tumor had not grown, but its surface showed changes in texture and color.
Histopathologically, the excised specimen was indicative of MCC coincident with
SCC and showed extensive necrosis in the upper portion of the tumor, numerous
caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells, an accumulation of CD68-positive foam cells
and vascular invasion. These findings suggested that the tumor had regressed. We 
hypothesize that extensive coagulative necrosis resulting from an insufficient
local blood supply triggered the shedding of some products or components of MCC
and SCC, which in turn induced antitumor immunity against both lesions.
