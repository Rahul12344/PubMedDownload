Here we present the genome sequence of a novel dsRNA virus we designed as
Rhizoctonia solani RNA virus HN008 (RsRV-HN008) from a filamentous fungus R.
solani. Its genome (7596 nucleotides) contains two non-overlapping open reading
frames (ORF1 and ORF2). ORF1 encoded a 128 kDa protein that showed no significant
identity to any other virus sequence in the NCBI database. ORF2 encoded a protein
with a molecular weight of 140 kDa and shared a low percentage of sequence
identity to the RdRps of unclassified dsRNA viruses. Sequence analysis revealed
that RsRV-HN008 may be a member of a novel unclassified family of mycoviruses.
