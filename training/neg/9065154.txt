Two women with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infection are described who 
were seen with painful aphthous vaginal ulceration and CD4+ lymphocyte counts <
50 cells/mm3. A chronic rectovaginal fistula developed in one patient. In spite
of extensive investigation no underlying cause of the ulceration was discovered. 
Clinical therapeutic response suggests that corticosteroid therapy may be of
value in healing or stabilizing the destructive process. Clinicians should be
aware of this complication in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with
severe vaginal pain and unexplained discharge.
