BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus infection has been reported in association 
with several extrahepatic manifestations. Included in this list is interstitial
lung involvement.
AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate pulmonary alterations in
patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.
PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection were
enrolled into a prospective study. One patient has been excluded because of
underlying tuberculosis.
METHODS: All patients underwent pulmonary function tests, diffusion capacity for 
carbon monoxide and high-resolution computed tomography of the chest.
RESULTS: Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in first second/forced
vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in first second values were reduced
to less than 80% of predicted values in 3, 11 and 5 patients, respectively.
Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide was low in 12 patients (60%), 8 of whom
had simultaneous decrease in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide/VA values.
Thorax high-resolution computed tomography revealed abnormal findings in eight
patients (40%). Fifteen patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (75%)
had at least one pulmonary alteration as evidenced by abnormal pulmonary function
tests, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and/or high-resolution computed
tomography results.
CONCLUSION: In spite of a limited study population, these findings may implicate 
that pulmonary manifestations of chronic hepatitis C virus infection are
frequently underdiagnosed.
