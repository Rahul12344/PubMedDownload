An improved plaque reduction assay for antiviral activity was developed and used 
to examine extracts from sixty-one higher plants. Substantial antiviral activity 
was observed in ca. 20%, which is higher than might be expected given the limited
metabolic differences between viruses and their hosts. The frequent antiviral
activity may represent phytoalexins elaborated to protect against plant viruses.
