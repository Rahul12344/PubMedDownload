[High poly A content of the native genome of murine oncornaviruses : presence of 
65-70 S RNA lacking polyadenylic sequences].

[Article in French]

d'Auriol L, Emanoil-Ravicovitch R, Robert J.

High molecular weight Poly (A) minus RNA was isolated from native genome of
murine oncornaviruses. The Poly (A) content of viral genomes seems to depend more
on cellular multiplication than viral maturation.
