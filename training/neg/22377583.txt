Herpesviruses consistently transmit from immunocompetent carriers, implying that 
their neutralization is hard to achieve. Murid herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) exploits
host IgG Fc receptors to bypass blocks to cell binding, and pH-dependent protein 
conformation changes to unveil its fusion machinery only after endocytosis.
Nevertheless, neutralization remains possible by targeting the virion
glycoprotein H (gH)-gL heterodimer, and the neutralizing antibody responses of
MuHV-4 carriers are improved by boosting with recombinant gH-gL. We analysed here
how gH-gL-directed neutralization works. The MuHV-4 gH-gL binds to heparan
sulfate. However, most gH-gL-specific neutralizing antibodies did not block this 
interaction; neither did they act directly on fusion. Instead, they blocked
virion endocytosis and transport to the late endosomes, where membrane fusion
normally occurs. The poor endocytosis of gH-gL-neutralized virions was
recapitulated precisely by virions genetically lacking gL. Therefore, driving
virion uptake appears to be an important function of gH-gL that provides a major 
target for antibody-mediated neutralization.
