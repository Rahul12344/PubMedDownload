A 19-year-old man with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant with unrelated bone
marrow. On day 20, the patient developed impaired consciousness and
disorientation. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed 2Ã—10(4) copies/mL
of HHV6B. HHV6 encephalitis was diagnosed, as had HHV6 myelitis based on symptoms
that included lancinating pain/pruritus in the lower limbs and dysuria/dyschezia.
Concurrently, he showed sinus tachycardia. Even after clearance of the HHV6
genome from the plasma and CSF was achieved by treatment with foscarnet, sinus
tachycardia persisted for another 100 days. We suspected prolonged sinus
tachycardia due to dysautonomia caused by HHV6 encephalomyelitis.
