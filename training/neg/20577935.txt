Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) involves the intravenous infusion of
hematopoietic progenitor cells from an HLA-matched donor (allogeneic) or from the
patient (autologous). Prior to HCT, the recipient is prepared (conditioning) with
high-dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy (or both) to destroy defective bone marrow
or residual cancer cells. After allogeneic HCT, there is the need for chronic
immunosuppression to prevent graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD). The frequency and type of neurologic complications depends on the type of
HCT, the underlying disease, and the case ascertainment. In this review, the
neurologic complications are presented according to the stage of HCT that they
are most likely to occur: (1) conditioning-drug-related encephalopathies and
seizures or complications secondary to medical procedures; (2) bone marrow
depletion-metabolic and drug-related encephalopathies and seizures, septic
cerebral infarctions, and hemorrhages; (3) chronic immunosuppression-infections
by viruses and opportunistic organisms; and (4) late events-central nervous
system (CNS) relapses of the original disease, neurologic complications of GVHD, 
and second neoplasms.
