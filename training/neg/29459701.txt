Current neural interfaces are hampered by lack of specificity and selectivity for
neural interrogation. A method that might improve these interfaces is an optical 
peripheral nerve interface which communicates with individual axons via
optogenetic reporters. To determine the feasibility of such an interface, we
delivered the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f to the mouse
peripheral nerve by intramuscular injection of adenoassociated viral vector
(AAV1) under the control of the CAG (chicken beta actin- cytomegalovirus hybrid
promoter). Small diameter axons in the common peroneal nerve were transduced and 
demonstrated electrically inducible calcium transients ex vivo. Responses to
single electrical stimuli were resolvable, and increasing the number of stimuli
resulted in a monotonic increase in maximum fluorescence and a prolongation of
calcium transient kinetics. This work demonstrates the viability of using a
virally-delivered, genetically-encoded calcium indicator to read-out from
peripheral nerve axons.
