We describe a new global multiple-alignment program capable of aligning a large
number of genomic regions. Our progressive-alignment approach incorporates the
following ideas: maximum-likelihood inference of ancestral sequences, automatic
guide-tree construction, protein-based anchoring of ab-initio gene predictions,
and constraints derived from a global homology map of the sequences. We have
implemented these ideas in the MAVID program, which is able to accurately align
multiple genomic regions up to megabases long. MAVID is able to effectively align
divergent sequences, as well as incomplete unfinished sequences. We demonstrate
the capabilities of the program on the benchmark CFTR region, which consists of
1.8 Mb of human sequence and 20 orthologous regions in marsupials, birds, fish,
and mammals. Finally, we describe two large MAVID alignments, an alignment of all
the available HIV genomes and a multiple alignment of the entire human, mouse,
and rat genomes.
