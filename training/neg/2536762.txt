Gianotti-Crosti syndrome, a distinctive eruption occurring after hepatitis B
infection, is characterized by symmetric, nonpruritic lichenoid papules usually
localized to the face, limbs, and buttocks. In North America, hepatitis B
antigenemia is rarely associated with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome in infants. Recent
reports indicate there are a variety of infectious agents associated with
Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. We report a case of an 11-month-old white female infant
with Gianotti-Crosti syndrome and concurrent primary Epstein-Barr virus infection
without evidence of hepatitis B infection.
