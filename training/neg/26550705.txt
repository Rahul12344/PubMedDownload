Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)Â is a highly contagious tick-borne disease
that impacts many countries in parts of Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle
East. Outbreaks are episodic, but deadly. Due to the highly contagious nature of 
this disease, suspected cases are taken extremely serious, with very strong
control measures implemented almost immediately. It is primarily those living on 
farms, livestock workers, and medical workers who are at risk. The virus
responsible for CCHF is transmitted asymptomatically and transiently to
livestock, and symptomatically to humans. The fatality rate in human cases can be
very high. The number of methods and directions of viral transmission is large,
including tick-to-tick, tick-to-livestock, tick-to-human, livestock-to-tick,
livestock-to-human, and human-to-human. We model CCHF using a deterministic
system of nonlinear differential equations. This compartment model allows us to
analyse threshold parameters and equilibria describing the magnitude and
progression of cases of the disease in a hypothetical outbreak.
