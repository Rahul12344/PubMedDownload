In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism whereby dexamethasone could reactivate
bovine herpesvirus type-1 the effect of dexamethasone on virus replication and
leukocyte functions was assessed. No effect was detectable on either virus yield 
or in vitro replication kinetics. In contrast, dexamethasone influenced several
leukocyte functions thought to be of importance in antiviral defense and
maintenance of latency. In vitro exposure of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear
neutrophilic granulocytes of normal animals to dexamethasone depressed their
migratory and cytotoxic activities, but had no effect on Fc- and complement
receptor expression. Dexamethasone also depressed lectin-induced lymphocyte
proliferation and interleukin-2 generation in a dose-dependent manner. When cows 
were treated repeatedly with dexamethasone and their leukocytes assayed,
suppression of phytohemagglutinin-induced lymphocyte proliferation, interleukin-2
generation, natural cytotoxicity of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear
neutrophilic granulocyte functions were observed. In contrast, concanavalin A
induced lymphocyte proliferation was increased following treatment.
