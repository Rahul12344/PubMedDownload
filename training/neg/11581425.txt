The C-type lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR capture and transfer human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to susceptible cells, although the underlying
mechanism is unclear. Here we show that DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR-mediated HIV
transmission involves dissociable binding and transfer steps, indicating that
efficient virus transmission is not simply due to tethering of virus to the cell 
surface.
