We report three children with clinical features of pityriasis lichenoides (scaly 
red to brown papules and macules) in whom there were histopathological findings
of mycosis fungoides (disproportionate epidermotropism, Pautrier's
microabscesses, and wiry and coarse collagen bundles). Immunohistochemical
staining revealed a prevalence of T lymphocytes in the infiltrate. T-cell
receptor gene rearrangement analysis in lesional skin demonstrated rearrangement 
of the gamma chain in all cases. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 serology 
was negative in the two patients in whom this test was performed. Thus, lesions
resembling pityriasis lichenoides can be an unusual and potentially misleading
presentation of mycosis fungoides.
