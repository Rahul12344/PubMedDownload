In 2009, a cross-sectional survey of 360 poultry workers in Hong Kong, China,
showed that workers had inadequate levels of avian influenza (H5N1) risk
knowledge, preventive behavior, and outbreak preparedness. The main barriers to
preventive practices were low perceived benefits and interference with work.
Poultry workers require occupation-specific health promotion.
