The bacteriophage P4 alpha gene is the structural gene for bacteriophage
P4-induced RNA polymerase.

Barrett KJ, Blinkova A, Arnold G.

Two temperature-sensitive mutants of satellite phage P4 which do not synthesize
P4 DNA at the nonpermissive temperature have been isolated. One of these phage is
mutated in the P4 alpha gene. It complements a P4 delta mutant, but not a P4
alpha amber mutant; both mutants are phenotypically identical to alpha amber
mutants in all properties studied. They synthesize P4 early proteins 1 and 2 as
well as two additional P4-induced early proteins, 5 and 6, which are described
here. P4 late proteins are not synthesized by these mutants and cannot be
transactivated by helper phage P2. The mutants are unable to transactivate P2
late proteins from a P2 AB mutant. The P4 RNA polymerase activity which has been 
suggested to be involved in P4 DNA synthesis is not detected at the nonpermissive
temperature. The P4 polymerase activity in partially purified extracts prepared
from cells infected with the mutant at the permissive temperature is temperature 
sensitive. Reduced activity is found in vitro when these extracts are
preincubated at 41 degrees C or assayed at temperatures higher than 37 degrees C.
Thus, the P4 RNA polymerase is the product of the alpha gene. Temperature shift
experiments show that the alpha gene product is required until late in the P4
cycle.
