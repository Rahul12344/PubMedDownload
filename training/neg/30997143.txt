Visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) has shown disappointing
performance when used alone as part of screen and treat strategies for cervical
cancer prevention in Papua New Guinea. Point-of-care testing with the XpertÂ® HPV 
assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) offers a new approach, enabling 'test and
treat' services using self-collected specimens with same-day curative cervical
ablation (cryotherapy or thermocoagulation).
