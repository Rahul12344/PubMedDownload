PURPOSE: The development of a genetically modified live rabies vaccine applicable
to wild raccoon dogs is necessary for the eradication of rabies in Korea. Thus,
we constructed a recombinant rabies virus (RABV) called the ERAGS strain, using a
reverse genetic system and evaluated its safety and efficacy in mice and its
safety and immunogenicity in raccoon dogs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ERAGS, which has Asn194Ser and Arg333Glu substitutions in 
the glycoprotein, was constructed using site-directed mutagenesis. Mice were
inoculated with the ERAGS strain (either 10(5.0) or 10(7.0) FAID50/mL) via
intramuscular (IM) or intracranial injections and then challenged with a virulent
RABV. Raccoon dogs were administered the ERAGS strain (10(8.0) FAID50/mL) either 
orally or via the IM route and the immunogenicity of the strain was evaluated
using fluorescent antibody virus neutralization tests.
RESULTS: The ERAGS strain inoculated into murine neuroblastoma cells reached
10(7.8) FAID50/mL at 96-hour post-inoculation. The virus was not pathogenic and
induced complete protection from virulent RABV in immunized 4- and 6-week-old
mice. Korean raccoon dogs immunized with the ERAGS strain via IM or oral route
were also safe from the virus and developed high titer levels (26.4-32.8 IU/mL)
of virus-neutralizing antibody (VNA) at 4 weeks post-inoculation.
CONCLUSION: The ERAGS RABV strain was effectively protective against rabies in
mice and produced a high VNA titer in raccoon dogs.
