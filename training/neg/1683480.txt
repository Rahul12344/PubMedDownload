Mice can be immunized to Plasmodium vinckei by repeated infections followed by
cure. Such immunity is dependent on CD4 T cells and an architecturally modified
spleen, but has little requirement for antibody. Thus, athymic mice can be
exposed to P. vinckei and cured, but do not develop immunity. They are resistant 
to challenge with parasites, however, if they are then given spleen cells from
euthymic immunized animals. Such immune spleen cells, however, cannot transfer
resistance to normal mice which have been exposed to BCG, Salmonella typhimurium,
or vaccinia virus, and are only partially effective in transferring resistance to
mice which have been previously immunized with heterologous plasmodia, P. yoelii,
P. chabaudi and P. berghei. Mice exposed to varying numbers of irradiated P.
vinckei-pRBC do not develop immunity and nor are such animals protected following
adoptive transfer of immune spleen cells. Cellular immunity to malaria may not
only be dependent on a population of immune CD4 T cells, but may require a
specifically architecturally modified spleen which may not occur following either
exposure to candidate vaccine vectors, heterologous plasmodia or non-viable
homologous plasmodia.
