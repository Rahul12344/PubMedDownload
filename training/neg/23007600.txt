A general mathematical model of viral infections inside a spherical organ is
presented. Transported quantities are used to represent external cells or viral
particles that penetrate the organ surface to either promote or combat the
infection. A diffusion mechanism is considered for the migration of transported
quantities to the organ inner tissue. Cases that include the effect of
penetration, diffusion and proliferation of immune system cells, the generation
of latently infected cells and the delivery of antiviral treatment are analyzed. 
Different antiviral mechanisms are modeled in the context of spatial variation.
Equilibrium conditions are also calculated to determine the radial profile after 
the infection progresses and antiviral therapy is delivered for a long period of 
time. The dynamic and equilibrium solutions obtained in this paper provide
insight into the temporal and spatial evolution of viral infections.
