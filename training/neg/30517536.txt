INTRODUCTION: The incidence of syphilis has increased since the 1970s.
METHODS: This was a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study with a
non-probabilistic sample.
RESULTS: Of 973 patients with human immunodeficiency virus, 179 (18.4%) tested
positive for both human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis, 84.8% were men,
50.9% were aged between 36 and 50 years, 47.8% with syphilis were diagnosed with 
human immunodeficiency virus for 10-20 years, and 40.3% received antiretroviral
therapy for 10-20 years.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of syphilis in patients with human immunodeficiency
virus is higher than expected, making it urgent to adopt efficient public health 
measures.
