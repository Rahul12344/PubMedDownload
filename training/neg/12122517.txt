A 43-year-old man with common variable immune deficiency underwent liver
transplantation for cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV had been
acquired from a contaminated batch of immunoglobulin. He developed cirrhosis
within 3 years of infection with the virus, then liver failure requiring liver
transplantation. The immediate post-transplant course was uncomplicated. Five
months after transplantation he developed liver failure, and the histological
appearances were those of severe cholestatic hepatitis. Withdrawal of
immunosuppression resulted in recovery from liver failure. Clearance of the HCV
from serum was also observed and has been sustained during follow-up (despite the
subsequent reintroduction of low-dose immunosuppression). The patient is alive
and well more than 5 years after transplantation. His post-transplant course has 
been remarkable for the aggressive recurrence then clearance of the HCV.
