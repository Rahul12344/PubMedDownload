Dengue virus (DENV) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that produces
significant morbidity worldwide resulting in an estimated 50-100 million
infections annually. DENV causes a spectrum of illness ranging from inapparent
infection to life-threatening hemorrhagic fever and shock. The varied DENV
disease outcome is determined by complex interactions between immunopathologic,
viral, and human genetic factors. This review summarizes these interactions with 
a focus on human genetic determinants of DENV susceptibility, including human
leukocyte antigens, blood type, and single nucleotide polymorphisms in immune
response genes that have been associated with DENV disease. We also discuss other
factors related to DENV outcome including viral genetic determinants, age,
ethnicity, and nutritional status as they relate to DENV susceptibility. We
emphasize the need for functional genetics studies to complement
association-based data and we call for controlled study designs and standard
clinical DENV disease definitions that will strengthen conclusions based on human
genetic DENV studies.
