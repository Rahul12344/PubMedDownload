Effect of site-specific endonuclease digestion on the thyP3 gene of bacteriophage
phi 3T and the thyP11 gene of bacteriophage rho11.

Graham RS, Young FE, Wilson GA.

phi 3T and rho11 are closely related bacteriophages of Bacillus subtilis which
can "convent" thymine auxotrophs to thymine prototrophs upon infection or
transfection. The effect of endonuclease digestion on the ability of both
bacteriophage and prophage DNA from phi eT and rho11 to transform for thymine
prototrophy was determined. All of the endonucleases tested: BamHI, Bg/II, BsuRI,
EcoRI, HindII+ III, and HpaII reduced the efficiency of thyP transformation to an
equal extent in prophage and bacteriophage DNA. Only HpaII completely abolished
thyP transformation. The reduction in transformation with BamHI, Bg/II, BsuRI,
EcoRI, and HpaII fragments is size related. The thyP transforming fragments
generated by these endonucleases are potentially clonable.
