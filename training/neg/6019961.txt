laboratory studies.

Pokoski MO, Boudreault A, Pavilanis V.

Laboratory studies of an influenza B epidemic in the Province of Quebec carried
out during the spring of 1966 are described. During that period six influenza B
strains were isolated. The isolated strains did not differ markedly from previous
influenza B strains. The serological studies showed that this epidemic had spread
over different parts of the Province of Quebec.The serological studies also
showed that an isolated community, such as an armed forces camp, can exhibit an
epidemiological pattern different from that obtaining in the whole population.
