Infections with the influenza C virus causing respiratory symptoms are common,
particularly among children. Since isolation and detection of the virus are
rarely performed, compared with influenza A and B viruses, the small number of
available sequences of the virus makes it difficult to analyze its evolutionary
dynamics. Recently, we reported the full genome sequence of 102 strains of the
virus. Here, we exploited the data to elucidate the evolutionary characteristics 
and phylodynamics of the virus compared with influenza A and B viruses. Along
with our data, we obtained public sequence data of the hemagglutinin-esterase
gene of the virus; the dataset consists of 218 unique sequences of the virus
collected from 14 countries between 1947 and 2014. Informatics analyses revealed 
that (1) multiple lineages have been circulating globally; (2) there have been
weak and infrequent selective bottlenecks; (3) the evolutionary rate is low
because of weak positive selection and a low capability to induce mutations; and 
(4) there is no significant positive selection although a few mutations affecting
its antigenicity have been induced. The unique evolutionary dynamics of the
influenza C virus must be shaped by multiple factors, including virological,
immunological, and epidemiological characteristics.
