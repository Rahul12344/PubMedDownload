The paramyxovirus F protein is a class I viral membrane fusion protein which
undergoes a significant refolding transition during virus entry. Previous studies
of the Newcastle disease virus, human parainfluenza virus 3 and parainfluenza
virus 5 F proteins revealed differences in the pre- and post-fusion structures.
The NDV Queensland (Q) F structure lacked structural elements observed in the
other two structures, which are key to the refolding and fusogenic activity of F.
Here we present the NDV Australia-Victoria (AV) F protein post-fusion structure
and provide EM evidence for its folding to a pre-fusion form. The NDV AV F
structure contains heptad repeat elements missing in the previous NDV Q F
structure, forming a post-fusion six-helix bundle (6HB) similar to the
post-fusion hPIV3 F structure. Electrostatic and temperature factor analysis of
the F structures points to regions of these proteins that may be functionally
important in their membrane fusion activity.
