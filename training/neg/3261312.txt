A fluorometric assay avoiding the use of radioactivity has been developed for
detecting cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc cells). The method involves labelling
targets with Hoechst dye no. 33342 (H33342) which becomes brightly fluorescent on
binding to DNA. Lysis of target cells by Tc cells is quantified by measuring the 
release of fluorescent H33342 into the supernatant of culture wells. The
fluorescence is measured using an automated Microfluor reader which allows
results to be obtained rapidly. The assay has been used to detect alloreactive Tc
cells and H-2 restricted Tc cells against influenza virus in a short-term 6 h
assay using P815 and L929 as targets with comparable results to those obtained
with 51Cr labelling. In contrast, lymphocyte blasts were found to be less
sensitive in 6 h fluorometric assays when compared with the 51Cr assay. In
long-term overnight assays (possible because of the low spontaneous release of
H33342 from targets) lymphocyte blasts gave high specific lysis and some
anti-self reactivity. The cause of the anti-self reactivity may reflect
fundamental differences between the H33342 and 51Cr release assays.
