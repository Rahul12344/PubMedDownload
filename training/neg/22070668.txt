AIM: To investigate the possible association of gene polymorphisms of tumour
necrosis factor (TNF)-α (-238 and -308), interleukin (IL)-10 (-592 and -819) and 
3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the IL12B (-1188) and hepatitis B in Chinese
Han haemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS: The genotyping of TNF-α -238 and -308, IL-10 -592 and -819 and 3'UTR of 
the IL12B were performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment 
length polymorphism (RFLP) method.
RESULTS: The TNF-α-238 A allele, the IL12B 3'UTR C/C, C/A genotypes were
associated with decreased susceptibility to hepatitis B viral infection (P =
0.047, P = 0.003 and P = 0.001 respectively). The frequencies of IL-10-592 A/A
genotype, IL-10-819 T/T genotype were lower in the HBV persistence group (P =
0.029 and P = 0.019) than those in the virus clearance group.
CONCLUSIONS: TNF-α and IL12B 3'UTR gene polymorphisms may be associated with HBV 
susceptibility and IL-10 gene polymorphisms may be related to the HBV persistence
infection in Chinese Han HD patients.
