The βC1 protein encoded by the Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus-associated
betasatellite functions as a pathogenicity determinant. To better understand the 
molecular basis whereby βC1 functions in pathogenicity, a yeast two-hybrid screen
of a tobacco cDNA library was carried out using βC1 as the bait. The screen
revealed that βC1 interacts with a tobacco RING-finger protein designated NtRFP1,
which was further confirmed by the bimolecular fluorescence complementation and
co-immunoprecipitation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Expression of
NtRFP1 was induced by βC1, and in vitro ubiquitination assays showed that NtRFP1 
is a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates βC1 ubiquitination. In
addition, βC1 was shown to be ubiquitinated in vivo and degraded by the plant 26S
proteasome. After viral infection, plants overexpressing NtRFP1 developed
attenuated symptoms, whereas plants with silenced expression of NtRFP1 showed
severe symptoms. Other lines of evidence showed that NtRFP1 attenuates
βC1-induced symptoms through promoting its degradation by the 26S proteasome.
Taken together, our results suggest that tobacco RING E3 ligase NtRFP1 attenuates
disease symptoms by interacting with βC1 to mediate its ubiquitination and
degradation via the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system.
