profile.

Immunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity, and understanding T cell
memory will be central to the development of effective cell-mediated vaccines.
The characteristics and functions of CD4 memory cells have not been well defined.
Here we demonstrate that the increased size of the secondary response is solely a
consequence of the increased antigen-specific precursor frequency within the
memory pool. Memory cells proliferated less than primary responding cells, even
within the same host. By analyzing the entry of primary and memory cells into the
cell cycle, we found that the two populations proliferated similarly until day 5;
after this time, fewer of the reactivated memory cells proliferated. At this
time, fewer of the reactivated memory cells made IL-2 than primary responding
cells, but more made IFNgamma. Both these factors affected the low proliferation 
of the memory cells, because either exogenous IL-2 or inhibition of IFNgamma
increased the proliferation of the memory cells.
