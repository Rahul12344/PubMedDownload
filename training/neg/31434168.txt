Canine parvoviral enteritis (PVE) is an important intestinal disease of the
puppies; however, the potential impact of the canine parvovirus (CPV) on the gut 
microbiota has not been investigated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
evaluate the gut microbial shifts in puppies naturally infected with CPV. Fecal
samples were collected from healthy dogs and those diagnosed with PVE at 4, 6, 8,
and 12 weeks of age. The distal gut microbiota of dogs was characterized using
Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The sequence data were
analyzed using QIIME with an Operational Taxonomic Unit definition at a
similarity cutoff of 97%. Our results showed that the CPV was associated with
significant microbial dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. Alpha diversity and
species richness and evenness in dogs with PVE decreased compared to those of
healthy dogs. At the phylum level, the proportion of Proteobacteria was
significantly enriched in dogs with PVE while Bacteroidetes was significantly
more abundant in healthy dogs (p < 0.05). In dogs with PVE, Enterobacteriaceae
was the most abundant bacterial family accounting for 36.44% of the total
bacterial population compared to only 0.21% in healthy puppies. The two most
abundant genera in healthy dogs were Prevotella and Lactobacillus and their
abundance was significantly higher compared to that of dogs with PVE (p < 0.05). 
These observations suggest that disturbances of gut microbial communities were
associated with PVE in young dogs. Evaluation of the roles of these bacterial
groups in the pathophysiology of PVE warrants further studies.
