OBJECTIVE: The frequency of viral, bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens among 
270 paediatric patients (< 5 years of age) in various hospitals of Makkah and
Jeddah cities of Saudi Arabia were investigated.
METHODS: A total of 270 stool samples were collected from paediatric patients
with signs and symptoms of gastroenteritis from different hospitals of Makkah and
Jeddah cities of Saudi Arabia. Samples were investigated for bacterial, viral and
parasitic enteropathogens using microscopic examination, immunological tests and 
bacterial culture techniques.
RESULTS: Out of 270 stool samples tested in this study for various causative
agents of gastroenteritis, total number of positive samples were 106 (39%). Of
these, 90 (33%) had viral etiology, of which Rotavirus type A (serotype G) was
found in the majority of cases 60 (22%), Adenovirus in 20 (7%) patients, and
Astrovirus in the remaining 10 (4%) patients. Thirteen (5%) were of bacterial
origins of which 9 (3%) were Salmonella species, 4 (2%) were Shigella species and
only 3 (1%) of the samples were positive for Giardia lamblia.
CONCLUSION: This study indicated that most of the diarrhoeal diseases in young
children in Saudi Arabia are due to viral etiology, where Rotavirus was
predominant followed by Adenovirus and Astrovirus. While Salmonella and Shigella 
represent the bacterial etiology of paediatric acute diarrhoea and only Giardia
lamblia was found as a parasitic cause of diarrhoea in young children in our
study.
