Guanidine inhibits tobacco mosaic virus RNA synthesis at two stages.

Dawson WO.

Guanidine (GD) inhibited tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA synthesis at two
different steps, depending on the concentration of GD used. The time-course of
inhibition by 40 mM GD coincided with the time-course of RNA synthesis. However, 
10 mM GD inhibited an earlier step that occurred prior to viral RNA synthesis.
