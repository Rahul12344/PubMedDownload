Suicide gene delivery is significant in cancer therapy but has not been fully
investigated on a cellular scale. Here, Peak Force Quantitative Nanomechanical
atomic force microscopy (PFQNM-AFM) was applied to visualize the effect of herpes
simplex virus thymidine kinase dendriplexes (G4AcFaHSTK) on the morphological and
nanomechanical properties of individual live and dividing HeLa cells. Cells were 
then exposed to G4AcFaHSTK, followed by ganciclovir, and directly imaged by
real-time PFQNM-AFM. Cell membrane liquefaction, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and
cytoskeleton structure loss were observed during cell division. The average
Young's modulus of the nuclear region increased with time as the cell continued
from metaphase (6.29 kPa) to telophase (13.6 kPa) and then decreased (2.25 kPa)
upon apoptosis. In contrast, cells exposed to either ganciclovir or G4AcFaHSTK
alone have no changes. Thus, understanding the real-time effects of suicide
dendriplexes on the cytoskeletal and nanomechanical behaviors of cancer cells may
provide new methods for cancer treatment.
