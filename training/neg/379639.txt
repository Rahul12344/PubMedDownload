In vitro mutagenicity and cell transformation screening of phenylglycidyl ether.

Greene EJ, Friedman MA, Sherrod JA, Salerno AJ.

Phenylglycidyl ether (1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxy propane) (PGE) was tested for genetic
activity in bacterial and mammalian tests. It was active in the
Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity test. Concentration-dependent mutagenicity was 
demonstrated in S. typhimurium strains TA1535 and TA100 with and without rat S9, 
but not in strains TA98, TA1537, or TA1538. These results suggest PGE, is a
direct-acting mutagen causing base substitutions. Phenylglycidyl ether did not
induce 6-thioguanine-resistant mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or
without rat S9, and with or without serum in the medium. Dose-dependent
enhancement of SA7 virus transformation of primary hamster embryo cells was
observed at concentrations of 1.6 microgram/ml and higher. In addition, this
compound was able to chemically transform secondary hamster embryo cells at
concentrations of 6.2 micrograms/ml and higher. At a dose of 2500 mg/kg p.o., PGE
was active in the host-mediated assay using C57B1/6 X C3H mice and S. typhimurium
strain TA1535. This activity represented a positive response in 2 of 5 animals
tested. Murine testicular DNA synthesis was not inhibited by oral administration 
of PGE at 500 mg/kg.
