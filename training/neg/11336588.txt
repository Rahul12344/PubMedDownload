Saquinavir is a peptidomimetic inhibitor of HIV protease. Initially marketed as
Invirasetrade mark, the effectiveness of saquinavir was greatly hindered by its
nearly complete first pass metabolism by cytochrome P450 3A4. A new formulation, 
Fortovasetrade mark, appears to yield some six times the drug exposure and has
been demonstrated to yield virological and immunological results similar to those
of other protease inhibitors (PIs) when used in conjunction with two nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (nRTIs). Emerging data suggest it is safe to use
twice daily. Co-administration of either formulation of saquinavir with
nelfinavir and especially ritonavir yields greatly increased blood levels, with
corresponding superior magnitude and durability of viral suppression in first
line therapy, albeit with increased adverse effects. The combination of ritonavir
and saquinavir has also yielded the most promising results published for second
line therapy, after virological breakthrough on previous PI-containing therapy.
In addition, preliminary data suggests the possibility of once daily dosing of
ritonavir and saquinavir, which would be expected to increase compliance and
allow for direct observed therapy.
