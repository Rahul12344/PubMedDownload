Assay in the mouse for delayed-type hypersensitivity to murine leukemia virus.

Peters RL, Donahoe RM, Kelloff GJ.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), assayed by footpad swelling, was induced in 
6- to 8-week-old BALB/cCr mice immunized with formalin-inactivated,
sucrose-banded murine type-C viruses. The DTH response was inducible with as
little as 11.25 mug sensitizing antigen, was greatest after sc sensitization as
compared to im and ip sensitization, and was optimally elicited with a 7-day
challenge. A statistical evaluation of the DTH assay revealed that the test was
consistently reproducible and limited only by biologic variability of the mouse
and the standardization of the antigen preparation. The DTH response was specific
for type-C virus subtypes because it could distinguish the Rauscher strain of
murine leukemia virus from AKR leukemia virus when the challenge antigen was
extracted with Tween 80-ether. Immunized mice that gave DTH responses were
resistant to challenge with exogenous, live murine leukemia viruses.
