Four species of nonhuman primates were inoculated intranasally with 10(3.1) to
10(3.7) plaque forming units (pfu) of respiratory syncytial (RS) virus. Adults
squirrel monkeys and newborn rhesus monkeys became infected and shed small
quantities (peak titer 10(2.0) pfu/ml of nasopharyngeal swab specimen) of virus, 
but illness did not develop. Infant cebus monkeys aged 2 months became infected, 
shed 10(2.3) to 10(3.8) pfu/ml of nasopharyngeal swab specimen, but did not
become ill. Chimpanzees aged 15 to 18 months shed a large quantity of virus, up
to 10(6.0) pfu/ml of nasopharyngeal swab specimen and developed an upper
respiratory illness. Chimpanzees are proposed as a possible animal model for
future study of the immunopathology of RS virus disease and for in vivo
evaluation of attenuated live virus vaccine candidates.
