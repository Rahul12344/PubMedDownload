We present the case of a 48-year-old HIV-positive man, who developed acute onset 
of pain in both upper limbs associated with proximal weakness and distal
paraesthesia. Eight weeks prior to this presentation he had had varicella zoster 
affecting his right S1 dermatome. CD4 count was 355 cells/mm(3) and he was
antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive. Power was 0/5 proximally and 4/5 distally in 
the upper limbs. Reflexes were absent and there was sensory loss in the C5, C6
and T1 dermatomes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed a lymphocytosis
with low glucose; however, CSF Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and herpes
simplex virus polymerase chain reaction (HSV PCR) were negative as was syphilis
serology. Electromyography showed marked motor axonal loss. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) did not show any cervical spinal lesion. Varicella zoster virus
(VZV) PCR was positive in the CSF. He was treated with high-dose intravenous
aciclovir with good resolution of his syndrome over time and was commenced on
ART. We believe this to be the first case report of varicella reactivation
causing bilateral neuralgic amyotrophy in an HIV-positive patient.
