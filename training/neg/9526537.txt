We have sequenced the NIb coding region of sugarcane mosaic potyvirus strain SC
(SCMV-SC) and eight field isolates of SCMV from Australia. This region comprised 
1563 nucleotides and encoded a putative protein of 521 amino acids containing the
consensus motif GDD. The protease cleavage sites between the NIa/NIb and the
NIb/coat protein were found to be Q/C and Q/A, respectively. The SCMV sequences
were most similar to sorghum mosaic potyvirus with identities of 70% and 78% at
the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. When the sequences were
compared to each other, there was a maximum of 3.3% variation between isolates at
the nucleotide level and a maximum of 0.8% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic 
analysis of the sequences indicated the field isolates were grouped according to 
their geographical location. The SCMV sequence with most homology to all other
isolates has been selected to generate constructs for replicase-mediated
resistance.
