17 cases of severe dysplasia and urinary bladder intraepithelial carcinoma, 15
cases of invasive well differentiated urothelial carcinoma, 14 cases of
moderately differentiated and 10 cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma were
studied immunohistochemically. The role of metalloproteinases in urinary bladder 
carcinoma is established. Correlation between proliferative activity, protease
expression and the degree of tumor differentiation is found. Viral DNA of human
papilloma of 16/18 types in severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ was revealed
by hybridization in situ method.
