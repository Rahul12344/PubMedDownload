Consisting of nearly 60 functional genes, porcine interferon (IFN)-complex
represents an evolutionary surge of IFN evolution in domestic ungulate species.
To compare with humans and mice, each of these species contains about 20 IFN
functional genes, which are better characterized using the conventional IFN-α/β
subtypes as examples. Porcine IFN-complex thus represents an optimal model for
studying IFN evolution that resulted from increasing viral pressure during
domestication and industrialization. We hypothesize and justify that porcine
IFN-complex may extend its functionality in antiviral and immunomodulatory
activity due to its superior molecular diversity. Furthermore, these
unconventional IFNs could even confer some functional and signaling novelty
beyond that of the well-studied IFN-α/β subtypes. Investigations into porcine
IFN-complex will further our understanding of IFN biology and promote IFN-based
therapeutic designs to confront swine viral diseases.
