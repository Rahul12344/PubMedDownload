Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas ( n=23) and adenocarcinomas ( n=14) from
German patients were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and
Epstein-Barr-Virus (EBV) DNA. No DNA for either genital HPV or epidermodysplasia 
verruciformis-associated HPV was detected in any tumor. In contrast, 35% of
squamous cell carcinomas and 36% of adenocarcinomas were shown to contain EBV DNA
by nested polymerase chain reaction.
