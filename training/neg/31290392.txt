The newly identified tick-borne Alongshan virus (ALSV), a segmented Jingmen virus
group flavivirus, was recently associated with human disease in China. We report 
the detection of ALSV RNA in Ixodes ricinus ticks in south-eastern Finland.
Screening of sera from patients suspected for tick-borne encephalitis for Jingmen
tick virus-like virus RNA and antibodies revealed no human cases. The presence of
ALSV in common European ticks warrants further investigations on its role as a
human pathogen.
