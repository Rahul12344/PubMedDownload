Liver disease, although usually asymptomatic, is a frequent accompaniment of
AIDS. Hepatomegaly and macrosteatosis are prevalent but non-specific findings.
Evidence of remote hepatitis B virus infection is extremely common; however, the 
HBsAg carrier state, chronic active hepatitis, or cirrhosis occur no more
frequently in AIDS patients than in the general population. Opportunistic
intrahepatic infections (such as MAI, fungi, and CMV) or neoplasms (such as
lymphoma or KS) usually reflect a disseminated process; liver involvement
generally does not directly cause morbidity or result in death. Although
biochemical liver tests are commonly elevated in the AIDS population, alkaline
phosphatase has proved to be the most specific enzyme for infiltrative processes.
Percutaneous liver biopsy has a high diagnostic yield, although the treatment
options are currently limited. Acalculous cholecystitis and biliary tract
obstruction have been recently described and probably result from CMV and/or
cryptosporidial infection. Radiologic features of papillary stenosis and/or
sclerosing cholangitis have been demonstrated. In contrast to hepatic parenchymal
disease, these entities may be amenable to surgical or endoscopic therapeutic
maneuvers.
