Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) persists as a subclinical, lifelong infection in the
normal human host, but reactivation from latency in immunocompromised subjects
results in serious disease. Latency and reactivation are defining characteristics
of the herpesviruses and are key to understanding their biology; however, the
precise cellular sites in which HCMV is carried and the mechanisms regulating its
latency and reactivation during natural infection remain poorly understood. Here 
we present evidence, based entirely on direct analysis of material isolated from 
healthy virus carriers, to show that myeloid dendritic cell (DC) progenitors are 
sites of HCMV latency and that their ex vivo differentiation to a mature DC
phenotype is linked with reactivation of infectious virus resulting from
differentiation-dependent chromatin remodeling of the viral major immediate-early
promoter. Thus, myeloid DC progenitors are a site of HCMV latency during natural 
persistence, and there is a critical linkage between their differentiation to DC 
and transcriptional reactivation of latent virus, which is likely to play an
important role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection.
