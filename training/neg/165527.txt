Glucose tolerance and pancreatic ultrastructure in mice with long-term diabetes
induced by EMC virus (M variant) (38518).

Wellmann KF, Amsterdam D, Broods SE, Bolk BW.

Of 27 young male CD-1 mice infected with the M variant of the encephalomycarditis
(EMC) virus and surviving for 11 or 12 mo, all but three had normal glucose
tolerance curves, and all displayed normal islet cell morphology, at the time of 
sacrifice, in spite of an initital hyperglycemic response. Three animals
maintained diabetic glucose tolerance curves one year after infection but they,
too, failed to show significant morphological alterations in their pancreatic
beta cells.
