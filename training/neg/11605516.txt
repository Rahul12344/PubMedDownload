As one of the most popular model enzymes, the structure and evolution of
ribonucleases (RNases) have been studied thoroughly. But until recently,
scientists found out that RNases demonstrated a series of important biological
functions, such as controlling blood vessel formation, killing tumor cells and
inhibiting virus. Now immunotoxin, the antibody-toxin conjugate, becomes a
research hot spot. RNases with cytotoxicity are the candidates for the toxin
moiety of the immunotoxins. In this paper, the newly found cytotoxic functions of
RNases are discussed in detail.
