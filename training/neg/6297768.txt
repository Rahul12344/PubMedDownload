Specific binding of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex to the mouse mammary
tumor proviral promoter region.

Pfahl M.

To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which steroid hormones exert their
regulatory function, we investigated the interaction of a glucocorticoid-receptor
complex with purified DNA fragments from cloned mouse mammary tumor (MMTV)
proviral DNA. With a DNA-cellulose binding assay, rat and mouse glucocorticoid
receptors were found to interact with a high affinity site or sites in or near
the promoter region of the MMTV proviral DNA. The assay allowed the use of
unpurified as well as purified receptor, and therefore made it possible to
investigate the binding properties of mutant receptors. Two
nuclear-transfer-deficient receptors have a decreased affinity for specific as
well as unspecific DNA, but are still capable of distinguishing between the two
types of DNA. The existence of specific DNA binding sites for steroid-receptor
complexes is discussed in the context of a general model of steroid hormone
action.
