Recently, the vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) was introduced in the
national vaccination programmes of several countries worldwide. The established
association between HPV and the progression of cervical neoplasia provides
evidence of the expected protection of the vaccine against cervical cancer.
During the last two decades several studies have also examined the possible
involvement of HPV in non-genital cancers and have proposed the presence of HPV
in oesophageal, laryngeal, oropharyngeal, lung, urothelial, breast and colon
cancers. The possible involvement of HPV in these types of cancer would
necessitate the introduction of the vaccine in both boys and girls. However, the 
role of HPV in the pathogenesis of these types of cancer has yet to be proven.
Moreover, the controversial evidence of the possible impact of the vaccination
against HPV in the prevention of non-genital cancers needs to be further
evaluated. In this review, we present an overview of the existing epidemiological
evidence regarding the detection of HPV in non-genital cancers.
