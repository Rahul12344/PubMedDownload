The TAt protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) activates the 
expression of viral mRNA through a cis-acting element in the LTR termed TAR. TAR 
RNA forms a stable stem-loop structure. Mutagenesis studies indicate that the
stem structure, the primary sequence of the loop, and three unpaired bases in the
stem (bulge) are important for Tat activation. Using the in vitro-transcribed TAR
RNA as a probe, we have cloned a gene (TARBP-b) that encodes a TAR-binding
protein from a cDNA expression library derived from Hut-78 cells. Expression of
the 1.4-kb TARBP-b mRNA was observed in all mammalian cell lines tested. TARBP-b 
binds specifically to the bulge region of TAR RNA and trans-activates the HIV-1
long terminal repeat in the presence of ptat and prev expression plasmids. These 
results suggest that TARBP-b contributes to tat-mediated trans-activation.
