The objective of this study was to determine the abundance and distribution of γδ
T lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue during acute infection with high (HV) or low
virulence (LV) non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in beef calves. 
This study was performed using tissue samples from a previous experiment in which
thirty beef calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: LV [n=10; animals
inoculated intranasally (IN) with LV BVDV-1a (strain SD-1)], HV [n=10; animals
inoculated IN with HV BVDV-2 (strain 1373)], and control (n=10; animals
inoculated with cell culture medium). On day 5 post inoculation, animals were
euthanized, and samples from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) were
collected to assess the abundance of WC1(+) γδ T cells. A higher proportion of
calves challenged with BVDV showed signs of apoptosis and cytophagy in MLN and
spleen samples compared to the control group. A significantly lower number of γδ 
T cells was observed in spleen and MLN from calves in HV and LV groups than in
the control calves (P<0.05). In conclusion, acute infection with HV or LV BVDV
resulted in depletion of WC1(+) γδ T cells in mucosal and systemic lymphoid
tissues at five days after challenge in beef calves. This reduction in γδ T cells
in the studied lymphoid tissues could be also due to lymphocyte trafficking to
other tissues.
