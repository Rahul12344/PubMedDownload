Valproic acid (VPA) is a small fatty acid used for treatment of different
neurologic diseases such as epilepsy, migraines or bipolar disorders. VPA
modulates different processes of cell metabolism that can lead to alterations in 
susceptibility of several cell types to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as to exert an inhibitory effect
on the replication of different enveloped viruses in cultured cells. Taken these 
data into account and the fact that HSV-1 has been involved in some neuropathies,
we have characterized the effect of VPA on this herpesvirus infection of the
differentiation/maturation-inducible human oligodendrocyte cell line HOG, which
resulted more susceptible to VPA inhibition of virus growth after cell
differentiation. In these cells, the role of VPA in virus entry was tackled.
Incubation with VPA induced a slight but reproducible inhibition in the virus
particles uptake mainly observed when the drug was added in the adsorption or
early upon infection. In addition, transcription and expression of viral proteins
were significantly downregulated in the presence of VPA. Remarkably, when the
infective viral production was assessed, VPA dramatically blocked the detection
of infectious HSV-1 particles. Herein, our results indicate that VPA treatment of
HOG cells significantly reduces the effect of HSV-1 infection, virus entry and
productivity without affecting cellular viability.
