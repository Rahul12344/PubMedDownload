Experimental carcinoma of liver in macaque monkeys exposed to diethylnitrosamine 
and hepatitis B virus.

The effects of treatments with diethylnitrosamine (DENA) and hepatitis B virus
(HBV) on macaque monkeys were investigated by virus serology and by light and
electron microscopy. The experimental groups comprised 43 newborn or juvenile
cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys of both sexes. HBV neither had a carcinogenic
effect nor increased the oncogenic effect of DENA. However, HBV given to juvenile
primates before treatment with DENA resulted in subsequent gross and microscopic 
alterations consistent with mild hepatitis and postnecrotic cirrhosis; multifocal
liver carcinoma apparently developed within these cirrhotic nodules. The
pathologic findings in the experimental animals were strikingly similar to those 
observed in liver cancer patients.
