Nosocomial infections with respiratory tract viruses, particularly influenza and 
respiratory syncytial viruses, account for the majority of serious nosocomial
viral disease. Chronically ill, immunocompromised, elderly, and very young hosts 
are especially vulnerable to potentially life-threatening involvement of the
lower respiratory tract. Effective preventive strategies are based upon early
accurate viral diagnosis and an appreciation of the epidemiology and mechanisms
of transmission for each viral agent. Influenza viruses spread via airborne
dispersion of small particle aerosols, resulting in explosive outbreaks; control 
measures emphasize immunization and chemoprophylaxis of susceptible patients and 
personnel, and isolation of those already infected. Transmission of respiratory
syncytial virus, in contrast, seems to require closer contact, with virus passed 
on hands, fomites, or in large droplets inoculated into the eyes and nose at
close range. Strategies for control of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus are
designed to interrupt hand carriage and inoculation of virus onto mucous
membranes.
