The appearance of single cell microorganisms on earth dates back to more than 3.5
billion years ago, ultimately leading to the development of multicellular
organisms approximately 3 billion years later. The evolutionary burst of species 
diversity and the "struggle for existence", as proposed by Darwin, generated a
complex host defense system. Host survival during infection in vital organs, such
as the lung, requires a delicate balance between host defense, which is essential
for the detection and elimination of pathogens and host tolerance, which is
critical for minimizing collateral tissue damage. Whereas the cellular and
molecular mechanisms of host defense against many invading pathogens have been
extensively studied, our understanding of host tolerance as a key mechanism in
maintaining host fitness is extremely limited. This may also explain why current 
therapeutic and preventive approaches targeting only host defense mechanisms have
failed to provide full protection against severe infectious diseases, including
pulmonary influenza virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. In this
review, we aim to outline various host strategies of resistance and tolerance for
effective protection against acute or chronic pulmonary infections.
