OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to understand the spread of HIV among
and between age and racial/ethnic groups of men who engage in male-to-male sexual
contact (MSM) in the United States.
DESIGN: An analysis of HIV-1 pol sequences for MSM collected through the US
National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS) during 2001-2012.
METHODS: Pairwise genetic distance was calculated to determine potential
transmission partners (those with very closely related nucleotide sequences, i.e.
distance â‰¤1.5%). We described race/ethnicity and age of potential transmission
partners of MSM.
RESULTS: Of 23 048 MSM with HIV sequences submitted to NHSS during 2000-2012, we 
identified potential transmission partners for 8880 (39%). Most potential
transmission partners were of the same race/ethnicity (78% for
blacks/African-Americans, 64% for whites and 49% for Hispanics/Latinos). This
assortative mixing was even more pronounced in the youngest age groups.
Significantly fewer young black/African-American and Hispanic/Latino MSM had
older potential transmission partners than young white MSM.
CONCLUSION: Black/African-American MSM, who are more profoundly affected by HIV, 
were more likely to have potential HIV transmission partners who were of the same
race/ethnicity and similar in age, suggesting that disparities in HIV infections 
are in large part not due to age-disassortative relationships. Concerted efforts 
to increase access to preexposure prophylaxis, quality HIV care and effective
treatment are needed to interrupt transmission chains among young,
black/African-American MSM.
