A multiscale approach, molecular dynamics/order parameter extrapolation (MD/OPX),
to the all-atom simulation of large bionanosystems is presented. The approach
starts with the introduction of a set of order parameters (OPs) automatically
generated with orthogonal polynomials to characterize the nanoscale features of
bionanosystems. The OPs are shown to evolve slowly via Newton's equations, and
the all-atom multiscale analysis (AMA) developed earlier (Miao and Ortoleva, J
Chem Phys 2006, 125, 44901) demonstrates the existence of their stochastic
dynamics, which serve as the justification for our MD/OPX approach. In MD/OPX, a 
short MD run estimates the rate of change of the OPs, which is then used to
extrapolate the state of the system over time that is much longer than the
10(-14) second timescale of fast atomic vibrations and collisions. The approach
is implemented in NAMD and demonstrated on cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV)
capsid structural transitions (STs). It greatly accelerates the MD code and its
underlying all-atom description of the nanosystems enables the use of a universal
interatomic force field, avoiding recalibration with each new application as
needed for coarse-grained models. The source code of MD/OPX is distributed free
of charge at https://simtk.org/home/mdopx and a web portal will be available via
