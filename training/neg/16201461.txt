OBJECTIVE: To construct infectious Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) based on the
in vitro-ligated cDNA template of the vaccine strain SA14-14-2, and identify the 
virus.
METHODS: Full-length genomic cDNA of JEV SA14-14-2 strain was ligated and then
RNA was transcribed in vitro, the infective virus was obtained by transfecting
the RNA into Vero cells and identified.
RESULTS: The infective clone of JEV was constructed, the virulence was weaker
than the wild virus.
CONCLUSION: It was possible to construct infectious clone from the production
strain of live attenuated Japanese B encephalitis vaccine.
