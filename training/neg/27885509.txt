OBJECTIVES: To determine the inhibitory activities of flavonoids against NS2B-NS3
protease of ZIKA virus (ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) and their structure activity relationship.
RESULTS: ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as a 35 kDa protein.
It had a K m of 26 µM with the fluorogenic peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edan.
The purified ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro was used for inhibition and kinetic assays to
determine the activities of 22 polyphenol compounds. These polyphenol compounds
at 100 µM inhibited the activity of ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro by 6.2-88%. Seven polyphenol
compounds had IC50 ranging from 22 ± 0.2 to 112 ± 5.5 µM. Myricetin showed a
mixed type inhibitory pattern against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro protease. Its IC50 value
was 22 ± 0.2 µM with a K i value of 8.9 ± 1.9 µM.
CONCLUSION: The chemical structure of a polyphenol compound and its inhibitory
activity against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro can be explored to develop highly selective
inhibitors against ZIKV NS2B-NS3pro.
