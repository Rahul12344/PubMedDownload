Antrodia cinnamomea is a highly valued folk medicine used for liver cancer, a
disease often caused by the long term infection of hepatitis C virus (HCV). In
the present study, the maleic and succinic acid constituents (antrodins A-E) of
this medicinal fungus, the in vivo metabolites of antrodin C and the analogue of 
one of the metabolites were tested for their inhibitory activity on HCV protease.
Most of the compounds showed potent inhibitory activity, with antrodin A being
the most potent (IC(50) = 0.9 microg/mL). Antrodin A was isolated as one of the
constituents of A. cinnamomea and was also detected as an in vivo metabolite of
the major constituent antrodin C. The mode of inhibition for antrodin A on HCV
protease was revealed by a Lineweaver-Burk plot as competitive inhibition. These 
results strongly support the use of this folk medicine for liver cancer and HCV
infection which is a global problem.
