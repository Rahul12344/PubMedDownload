BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate epigenetic status of cyclin A1 
in human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer. Y. Tokumaru et al., Cancer
Res 64, 5982-7 (Sep 1, 2004)demonstrated in head and neck squamous-cell cancer an
inverse correlation between cyclin A1 promoter hypermethylation and TP53
mutation. Human papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer, however, is deprived
of TP53 function by a different mechanism. Therefore, it was of interest to
investigate the epigenetic alterations during multistep cervical cancer
development.
METHODS: In this study, we performed duplex methylation-specific PCR and reverse 
transcriptase PCR on several cervical cancer cell lines and microdissected
cervical cancers. Furthermore, the incidence of cyclin A1 methylation was studied
in 43 samples of white blood cells, 25 normal cervices, and 24, 5 and 30 human
papillomavirus-associated premalignant, microinvasive and invasive cervical
lesions, respectively.
RESULTS: We demonstrated cyclin A1 methylation to be commonly found in cervical
cancer, both in vitro and in vivo, with its physiological role being to decrease 
gene expression. More important, this study demonstrated that not only is cyclin 
A1 promoter hypermethylation strikingly common in cervical cancer, but is also
specific to the invasive phenotype in comparison with other histopathological
stages during multistep carcinogenesis. None of the normal cells and low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesions exhibited methylation. In contrast, 36.6%, 60%
and 93.3% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, microinvasive and
invasive cancers, respectively, showed methylation.
CONCLUSION: This methylation study indicated that cyclin A1 is a potential tumor 
marker for early diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer.
