Nucleotide sequences were determined for the RNA segments coding for proteins
other than the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of the A/Leningrad/134/57 (H2N2)
wild-type (A/Len/wt) virus and its two cold-adapted (ca) and attenuated variants,
A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (A/Len/17/ca) and A/Leningrad/134/47/57 (A/Len/47/ca) that 
are used in the U.S.S.R. in the preparation of reassortant live attenuated
vaccines. Ten nucleotide differences were detected between the sequences of the
A/Len/wt and A/Len/17/ca viruses; of these, eight were deduced to encode amino
acid (aa) substitutions. One aa substitution each was predicted for the PB2, M1, 
M2, and NS2 proteins, whereas two aa substitutions each were predicted for the
PB1, and PA proteins of the A/Len/17/ca virus. Four additional nucleotide changes
were found in the genome of the A/Len/47/ca virus; three of these were detected
to code for one additional aa substitution each for the PB2, PB1, and NP
proteins.
