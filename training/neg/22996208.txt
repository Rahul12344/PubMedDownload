In this study, we have described the clinical characteristics of vaccine-modified
measles to assess the performance of an expanded case definition in a school
outbreak that occurred in 2010. The sensitivity, specificity, and the positive
and negative predictive values were evaluated. Among 74 cases of vaccine-modified
measles, 47 (64%) met the original case definition. Fever and rash were observed 
in 73% (54/74); fever was the most common (96%, 71/74) presenting symptom, and
rash was noted in 77% (57/74) of the cases. The original case definition showed
an overall sensitivity of 63.5% and a specificity of 100.0%. The expanded case
definition combining fever and rash showed a higher sensitivity (72.9%) but a
lower specificity (88.2%) than the original. The presence of fever and one or
more of cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis scored the highest sensitivity among the
combinations of signs and symptoms (77.0%), but scored the lowest specificity
(52.9%). The expanded case definition was sensitive in identifying suspected
cases of vaccine-modified measles. We suggest using this expanded definition for 
outbreak investigation in a closed community, and consider further discussions on
expanding the case definition of measles for routine surveillance in South Korea.
