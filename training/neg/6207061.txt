Differential expression of the cellular src gene during vertebrate development.

Schartl M, Barnekow A.

Cellular genes that are homologous to the transforming genes of certain RNA tumor
viruses are suspected to play a functional role during normal developmental
processes. To investigate this further, we are studying the expression of the
cellular homolog of the Rous sarcoma virus transforming gene (c-src) during
embryogenesis of fish, frog, and chicken by quantitative determination of the
activity of the c-src encoded protein kinase (pp60c-src). The kinase activity
from embryos of fish, frog, and chicken displays the same enzymatic
characteristics as the kinase from adult animals: It phosphorylates only tyrosine
residues in protein substrates, and its activity is relatively insensitive to
inhibition by the diadenosine nucleotide Ap4A. During the course of development, 
the varying kinase activity level reflects differential expression of the c-src
gene product. The kinase activity is low during early development, increases
dramatically during organogenesis, and decreases thereafter to the level found in
adult animals. The kinase activity displays an organ specificity, with brain
showing the highest activity in embryos as well as in adults. Muscle, however,
shows high activities during organogenesis, but no or barely detectable activity 
in adult animals. Our data suggest, therefore, that the c-src gene product plays 
more of a role in differentiation than in proliferation processes during
embryogenesis, and that it may act as a pleiotropic effector.
