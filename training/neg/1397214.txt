The immunogenicity of inactivated whole trivalent influenza vaccines
(A/Taiwan/1/86 (H1N1), A/Sichuan/2/87 (H3N2), and B ijing/1/87) recommended for
the 1988-89 winter season was evaluated in 236 elderly (mean age 71 years) high
risk volunteers. An overall significant increase in the number of subjects with
protective haemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies (titer > 1:40) against
vaccine components was observed after vaccination. Nevertheless, a percentage of 
individuals (ranging from 56% to 62%) remained without protective antibodies and 
the number of people showing a positive response was limited (from 32% to 41%).
By the comparative analysis of the results obtained examining the presence of
protective levels of antibody in the sera from 91 volunteers using HI versus the 
single radial haemolysis (SRH) test, we obtained evidence for a higher
sensitivity of SRH technique especially against B antigen.
