C.B-17 mice with the Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (SCID) mutation were
infected with the naturally occurring murine polyomavirus. Using the Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, persistence of polyomavirus was followed in
different tissues of the mice between 24 hours and 2 months post infection
(p.i.). Viral DNA appeared by 3-5 days and was detected in all studied organs by 
3 weeks p.i. From 4 weeks to 2 months p.i. viral DNA was present at high levels
in all studied organs in all of the animals. As controls normal C.B-17 and A/Sn
mice were used. Viral DNA appeared by 2-4 days. The infection reached a peak
around 1 week p.i. This was followed by a clearing stage and viral DNA was no
longer detectable by 4-5 weeks p.i. Most organs studied with PCR were also
examined histologically, but no lesions were observed. Consequently persistence
and organ distribution of polyomavirus in adult SCID mice differs greatly from
that in normal adult mice.
