Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a progressive immune mediated liver disease of
unknown origin. Key diagnostic features include hypergammaglobulinemia/elevated
serum-IgG, characteristic circulating autoantibodies, periportal hepatitis with
interface activity on liver biopsy and the exclusion of hepatotropic viruses.
However, the diagnosis is challenging in cholestatic and severe presentations. It
can be difficult to differentiate AIH from drug-induced liver injury. Although
many patients initially respond to standard immunosuppressive therapy, a
significant proportion experiences intolerable side effects or insufficient
treatment response. This underlines the need for effective alternative treatment 
options, which are still very limited and based on rather poor evidence. This
review summarises core aspects of the clinical management of AIH with focus on
recent achievements and unmet needs.
