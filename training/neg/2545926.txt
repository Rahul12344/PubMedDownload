NPC-KT cl.S61, a subclone derived from an epithelial-nasopharyngeal carcinoma
hybrid cell line (NPC-KT), showed cytopathic changes characteristic of
herpesvirus replication, including formation of multinucleated giant cells and
inclusion bodies, when Epstein-Barr virus replicative cycle was induced by
5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. Acyclovir (an inhibitor of herpesvirus DNA polymerase),
Epstein-Barr virus-immune human serum, or 2-deoxyglucose (an inhibitor of the
glycosylation) interfered with syncytium formation, indicating that a
virus-specified glycoprotein belonging to the late group is responsible for cell 
fusion induced by Epstein-Barr virus replication in cl.S61 cells.
