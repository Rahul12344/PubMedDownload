A bacterial mutation blocking P2 phage late gene expression.

Sunshine MG, Sauer B.

A mutant of Escherichia coli strain C has been isolated, called gro109, that
blocks bacteriophage P2 propagation by interfering with late gene expression. DNA
replication proceeds normally in P2+-infected gro109 cells, but late phage
proteins are not made. Early P2 mRNA is made in normal amounts, but very little
late mRNA can be detected. P2 mutants (P2 ogr) able to overcome the gro109 block 
have been isolated in which synthesis of late P2 mRNA and phage proteins Is
restored. The gro109 mutation is closely linked to the cluster of ribosomal genes
at 64 min and is recessive to the wild-type (gro+) allele. A P2 ogr mutation has 
been mapped on the left arm of the P2 genome, between the right-most known late
gene (D) and the phage attachment site. P2 ogr can complement P2+ in gro109
cells, indicating that ogr codes for a diffusible product.
