Hepatitis C and human fascioliasis are two of the most important public health
problems locally and internationally. Each one has its own complications
regarding spreading to man, clinical picture, laboratory and serologic diagnosis,
treatment and prevention. Concomitant human infection with both magnified the
complications. Clinically, both diseases (HCV and fascioliasis) have their own
broad signs and symptoms. In concomitant infection, the clinical pictures of both
showed some variations. The most common feature in fascioliasis and HCV patients 
was easy fatigability in 78.6% and the lowest was 7.18% for each of tympanic
abdomen, tender colon, tender right upper quadrant, itching, arthritis,
epi-gastric pain, and right quadrant pain. The eosinophilia % ranged from 5-24
and the haemoglobin ranged from 7-11.1 gm/dl. In patients with fascioliasis
alone, the most come feature was pallor in 96.15% and the lowest was 3.85% for
each of splenomegaly, ascites and itching. Eosinophilia % ranged from 1 to 22 and
haemoglobin ranged from 6-12 gm/dl. In general, the double infection with both
HCV and fascioliasis magnified the laboratory and clinical pictures of such
patients.
