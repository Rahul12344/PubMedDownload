Papillomavirus transforming functions.

Howley PM, Yang YC, Spalholz BA, Rabson MS.

The bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) has served as a model for unravelling
the molecular genetics of the papillomaviruses. BPV-1 transformation of rodent
cells in tissue culture has provided a means to study the viral functions
involved in latent infection of cells and in the induction of cellular
proliferation functions. BPV-1 has been shown to encode two independent
transforming genes, each of which can induce cellular transformation in
susceptible rodent cells. These two genes apparently act synergistically in
transforming mouse C127 cells. Deletion mutagenesis studies have shown that the
expression of one of these genes (E6) is required for efficient tumorigenesis and
anchorage independence. BPV-1 also encodes functions which may act indirectly to 
affect transformation. BPV-1 contains transcriptional enhancers which can act in 
a position-independent and orientation-independent manner to increase the
transcriptional activity of a heterologous gene. One of these elements, which is 
located in a non-coding region of the genome, can be trans-activated by a
specific viral gene product encoded by the E2 open reading frame. Mutations which
eliminate this trans-activation function also have a dramatic effect on
transformation and on stable plasmid maintenance.
