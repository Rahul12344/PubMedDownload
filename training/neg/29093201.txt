Preparation of Double-Stranded (Replicative Form) Bacteriophage M13 DNA.

Green MR, Sambrook J.

The double-stranded, closed-circular, replicative form (RF) of M13 DNA is present
in high copy numbers in infected cells, and its physical characteristics are
essentially identical to those of closed-circular plasmid DNAs. Any of the
methods commonly used to purify plasmid DNA can therefore be used to isolate M13 
RF DNA. This protocol describes the isolation of M13 RF DNA by alkaline lysis
from small volumes (1-2 mL) of infected bacterial cultures. The yield of DNA (1-4
mg, depending on the size of the M13 clone) is more than enough for most purposes
in molecular cloning. However, should more DNA be needed, the procedure can
easily be scaled up.
