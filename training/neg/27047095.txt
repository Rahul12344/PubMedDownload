AIM: This study was carried out to assess the presence of anti-bluetongue (BT)
antibodies in sheep, goat and cattle of different agro-climatic zones of
Jharkhand.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from apparently healthy as
well as suspected sheep, goat and cattle from different districts of Jharkhand
covering different agro-climatic zones. Serum samples were screened by indirect
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) for detecting anti-BT antibodies.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 480 animal serum samples (sheep-190, goats-210 and
cattle-80) screened, 83 (43.68%) of sheep, 91 (43.33%) of goat and 46 (57.50%) of
cattle sera were found positive. The % positivity ranged between 41% and 51% in
different agro-climatic zones. The results showed slight higher seroprevalence,
although not significantly, in cattle than sheep and goats in different
agro-climatic zones of Jharkhand.
CONCLUSIONS: The above data indicate widespread prevalence of BT virus antibodies
in studied areas. The incidence of BT is not detected officially, so far. The
present seroprevalence status of BT in Jharkhand indicates presence of BT
infection in the state for the first time.
