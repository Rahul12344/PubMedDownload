OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of incisional negative pressure wound therapy
in the prevention of postoperative wound morbidity in women with class III
obesity undergoing cesarean delivery.
METHODS: In an open label randomized controlled trial, women admitted for
delivery with class III obesity (body mass index 40 or higher) measured within 2 
weeks of admission for delivery were offered participation in the study. They
were consented either in the outpatient maternal-fetal medicine specialty clinic,
during admission to labor and delivery and before a decision to perform cesarean 
delivery, or in the preoperative area of the hospital before scheduled cesarean
delivery. Exclusion criteria included anticoagulation therapy, human
immunodeficiency virus infection, and silver or acrylic allergy. Those who
ultimately underwent cesarean delivery were randomized to standard surgical
dressing or incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressing. The primary
outcome was wound morbidity. Preplanned secondary outcomes included
characteristics of composite wound morbidity, and hospital, emergency room, and
clinic utilization. The sample size estimate required randomization of 440 women 
to detect a 50% decrease in composite outcome.
RESULTS: Between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2016, 850 women were screened and 
677 women with class III obesity were enrolled. Of these, 441 underwent cesarean 
delivery and were subsequently randomized (219 to standard dressing and 222 to
incisional negative pressure wound therapy). The primary outcome, overall
composite wound morbidity rate, was 18%. This was not different between the two
cohorts (incisional negative pressure wound therapy 17% vs standard dressing 19%,
relative risk 0.9 [95% CI 0.5-1.4]).
CONCLUSION: Prophylactic incisional negative pressure wound therapy use did not
reduce postoperative wound morbidity when compared with a standard surgical
dressing in women with class III obesity.
