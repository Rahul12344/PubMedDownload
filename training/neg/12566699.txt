OBJECTIVE: The liver has been increasingly recognized as a significant target
organ in the pathogenesis of dengue virus infection. However, only two
contradictory studies have examined the binding of the dengue virus to liver
cells. This study therefore sought to investigate the binding of the dengue virus
to HepG2 cells.
METHODS: Radiolabeled dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 were prepared through viral 
propagation in Vero cells. Increasing amounts of virus were then incubated with
HepG2 cells to determine the ability of the virus to achieve saturation of
binding on HepG2 cells.
RESULTS: Results indicated that it was not possible to reach saturation of
binding under experimentally achievable conditions. We then sought to determine
whether it was possible to reach a state of saturation of infection, by using
increasingly high titers of virus on a constant number of cells. Dengue serotype 
1 showed no evidence of saturation of infection, even at titers of 5,000 viruses 
per cell. In contrast, dengue serotype 2 became saturated at levels of
approximately 3,000 viruses per cell.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with proposals that dengue virus
binding to cells is mediated initially through a low-affinity interaction with an
abundant molecule on the surface of the cell and secondly through interaction
with a less commonly expressed molecule, which is required for viral
internalization.
