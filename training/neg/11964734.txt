In the past few years important advances have been made in the understanding of
the molecular mechanisms leading to X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP).
It has been possible to identify the gene defective in XLP and to demonstrate
that, in normal individuals, it encodes the Src homology 2 domain-containing
protein 1 A (SH2D1A) that plays a crucial role in signaling via a number of
surface molecules expressed by cells of the immune system. At present a variety
of mutations have been identified that result in lack of defective SH2D1A
molecules. Importantly, it has recently been demonstrated that lack of SH2D1A
affects the function of surface molecules that are involved in the mechanism of
natural killer-mediated recognition and killing of Epstein-Barr virus-infected B 
cells.
