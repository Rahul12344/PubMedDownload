An algorithm for the optimization of programmes aimed at the prevention and
control of virus diseases.

Cristea A.

A new algorithm is developed for the optimization of long-term programmes for the
prevention and control of virus diseases. Relatively simple formulae are written 
for the optimum numbers of antiepidemic services, the minimum cost of the
programmes and for the sensitivity of the optimization criterion to errors in the
estimation of the optimum numbers of services. The efficiency of the algorithm is
illustrated by an example referring to antimeasles vaccination campaigns.
