HIV-1 is an infectious virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and it is one of the major causes of deaths worldwide. The production of
HIV-1 protease (PR) on a large scale has been a problem for scientists due to its
cytotoxicity, low yield, insolubility, and low activity. HIV-1 C-SA protease has 
been cloned, expressed, and purified previously, however, with low recovery
(0.25 mg/L). Herein we report an optimal expression and solubilisation procedure 
to recover active HIV-1 C-SA protease enzyme from inclusion bodies. The HIV
protease was expressed in seven different vectors (pET11b, pET15b, pET28a pET32a,
pET39b, pET41b and pGEX 6P-1). The highest expression was achieved when the
vector pET32a (Trx tag) was employed. A total of 19.5 mg of fusion protein was
refolded of which 5.5 mg of active protease was obtained after cleavage. The free
protease had a high specific activity of 2.81 µmoles/min/mg. Interestingly the
Trx-fusion protein also showed activity closer (1.24 µmoles/min/mg) to that of
the free protease suggesting that the pET32a vector (Trx tag) expressed in
BL21(DE3) pLysS provides a more efficient way to obtain HIV-1 protease.
