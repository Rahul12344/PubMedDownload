A rotavirus strain HMG89 from Nigeria with short electrophoretic pattern was
typed G3 by PCR. A cDNA clone from the PCR product which hybridised in Northern
blots to RNA segment 9 of the homologous Nigerian rotavirus strain HMG89 and
laboratory reference strain 69M but not to other mammalian group A rotaviruses
was sequenced. The VP7 gene 9 sequence is 1060 nucleotides long with two base
deletions at positions 1034-1035. Sequence analysis of the primer (aAT8) used in 
the previous PCR serotyping assay revealed a mutation in one of the three
nucleotide bases at the 3' end of the primer binding site accounting for our
inability to serotype G8 strains in our samples. These findings demonstrate that 
PCR analysis can, albeit infrequently, lead to error in typing of rotaviruses due
to small numbers of mutations in the primer binding region.
