Noroviruses (NVs) are responsible for most cases of human nonbacterial
gastroenteritis worldwide. Some parameters for the purification of NV virus-like 
particles (VLPs) such as ease of production and yield were studied for future
development of vaccines and diagnostic tools. In this study, VLPs were produced
by the expression of the VP1 and VP2 gene cassette of the Brazilian NV isolate,
and two purification methods were compared: cesium chloride (CsCl) gradient
centrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography (IEC). IEC produced more and purer
VLPs of NV compared to CsCl gradient centrifugation.
