1. Antiviral activity of Heliothis virescens larval hemolymph was determined
using a cytotoxicity/virus inhibition test (TClD50) done in Vero cell tissue
cultures. Excellent antiviral activity was found especially against herpes
simplex viruses-1 and -2 and also against vesicular stomatitis, parainfluenza-3, 
coxsackie B3 and sindbis viruses. 2. Prolonged incubation of herpes simplex
virus-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus with hemolymph was virucidal and greatly
reduced infectivity of the two viruses in tissue culture. 3. Antiviral activity
was produced by both normal and immune (vaccinated larvae) cell-free hemolymphs. 
4. Antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus-1 could be generated in vitro 
with hemolymph phenoloxidase or mushroom tyrosinase using four different
substrates including tyrosine. 5. Activation of the insect melanization reaction 
by phenoloxidase was necessary for antiviral activity to occur.
