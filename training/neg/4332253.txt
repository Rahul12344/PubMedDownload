Protein synthesis directed by encephalomyocarditis virus RNA: properties of a
transfer RNA-dependent system.

Aviv H, Boime I, Leder P.

Small amounts of encephalomyocarditis virus RNA direct a 50-fold increase in
amino acid incorporation, in appropriately supplemented ascites tumor cell
extracts, under conditions that give rise to authentic viral polypeptides.
Incorporation in these crude extracts has a novel characteristic, namely, that it
is almost entirely dependent upon the addition of exogenous tRNA. Further, this
incorporation is restricted in that tRNA derived from ascites tumor cells or from
rat liver permits translation of viral RNA, whereas tRNA from yeast or
Escherichia coli does not. These translational barriers are due, at least in
part, to an incompatibility between the tRNA of yeast and E. coli and the
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases of the ascites tumor cell. A more extensive basis for 
this incompatibility is suggested, however, by the failure of the E. coli
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases to restore viral RNA-directed protein synthesis in the
presence of tRNA from E. coli, although the coli synthetases fully restore the
poly(U)-directed synthesis of polyphenyl-alanine. The possible role that unique
or favored codon classes might play in this restriction is considered, together
with the implications of the observed requirement for tRNA.
