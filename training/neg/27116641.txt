We develop a Flory mean-field theory for viral RNA (vRNA) molecules that extends 
the current RNA folding algorithms to include interactions between different
sections of the secondary structure. The theory is applied to sequence-selective 
vRNA encapsidation. The dependence on sequence enters through a single parameter:
the largest eigenvalue of the Kramers matrix of the branched polymer obtained by 
coarse graining the secondary structure. Differences between the work of
encapsidation of vRNA molecules and of randomized isomers are found to be in the 
range of 20 kBT, more than sufficient to provide a strong bias in favor of vRNA
encapsidation. The method is applied to a packaging competition experiment where 
large vRNA molecules compete for encapsidation with two smaller RNA species that 
together have the same nucleotide sequence as the large molecule. We encounter a 
substantial, generic free energy bias, that also is of the order of 20 kBT, in
favor of encapsidating the single large RNA molecule. The bias is mainly the
consequence of the fact that dividing up a large vRNA molecule involves the
release of stored elastic energy. This provides an important, nonspecific
mechanism for preferential encapsidation of single larger vRNA molecules over
multiple smaller mRNA molecules with the same total number of nucleotides. The
result is also consistent with recent RNA packaging competition experiments by
Comas-Garcia et al.1 Finally, the Flory method leads to the result that when two 
RNA molecules are copackaged, they are expected to remain segregated inside the
capsid.
