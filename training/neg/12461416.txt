OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the cervical shedding of herpes
simplex virus (HSV) and HIV-1.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study on 200 women seropositive for both HSV-2 and
HIV-1 was conducted in a family planning clinic at the Coast Provincial General
Hospital, Mombasa, Kenya.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantities of HSV DNA (types 1 and 2) and HIV-1 RNA as
well as the presence or absence of HIV-1 proviral DNA in cervical secretions were
determined and compared.
RESULTS: There was a significant correlation between the quantities of HSV DNA
and HIV-1 RNA in the cervical secretions of HSV-shedding women (Pearson's r =
0.24, P = 0.05). A 10-fold increase in the quantity of cervical HSV DNA was
associated with 1.35-fold higher cervical HIV-1-RNA levels (95% CI 1.00-1.81; P =
0.05), and with 1.36-fold greater odds of detection of HIV-1 proviral DNA (95% CI
1.05-1.75; P = 0.02).
CONCLUSION: Higher levels of cervical HSV were associated with higher levels of
expressed HIV-1 and with the more frequent detection of HIV-1-infected cells in
cervical secretions. Prospective studies are needed to explore further the
association between non-ulcerative cervical HSV reactivation and HIV-1 shedding. 
Such a relationship may have important implications for interventions designed to
slow the spread of HIV-1.
