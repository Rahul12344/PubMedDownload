This report demonstrates high efficiency transduction of enteric bacteria using
single strand plasmids packaged in M13 phage capsids. Transformation by plasmid
DNA is usually a very inefficient process in many enteric bacteria other than
Escherichia coli K12. Plasmids carrying an M13 origin of replication can be
replicated and packaged when cells carrying such plasmids are infected with M13
or a derivative helper phage. By introducing an F' plasmid into E. coli, Serratia
marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes, these species can
now be infected at high efficiency with M13 phage and with packaged single strand
plasmids, yielding an efficient method to introduce cloned DNA fragments into
these bacteria. The titer of colony forming units in a lysate was essentially
equivalent in all the bacteria, demonstrating an equal efficiency of transduction
of these other enteric bacteria compared to E. coli.
