BACKGROUND: Cell-culture-derived (CC) influenza vaccine production methods could 
provide benefits over classical embryonated-egg technology, including a higher
production capacity and the faster creation of a supply that meets demand.
METHODS: A CC-inactivated split-virus influenza A/Indonesia/5/2005(H5N1) vaccine 
derived from the EB66 cell line (hereafter, "CC-H5N1") was investigated in a
phase 1 randomized, blinded study. Healthy adults (n = 521) received 2 vaccine
doses (days 0 and 21) of either investigational CC-H5N1 vaccine (1.9 µg or 3.75
µg of hemagglutinin antigen [HA] with the AS03 adjuvant system or 15 µg of plain 
HA), embryonated-egg-derived vaccines (3.75 µg of HA with AS03 or 15 µg of plain 
HA), or placebo. Assessment of the adjuvant effect and immunogenicity was
performed using Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research acceptability
criteria 21 days after dose 2. Safety was assessed until month 12.
RESULTS: AS03-adjuvanted CC-H5N1 elicited a homologous hemagglutination
inhibition antibody response that satisfied immunogenicity criteria 21 days after
dose 2 and persisted at month 12. Adjuvant effect and immune response against a
drift-variant strain were demonstrated. No vaccine-related serious adverse events
were reported. The immunogenicity and safety of the CC-H5N1 formulation
containing 3.75 µg of HA and AS03 appeared to be similar to those for the
licensed egg-derived AS03-adjuvanted control vaccine.
CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of the EB66 cell line to produce an immunogenic
influenza vaccine with acceptable safety profile was demonstrated. Antigen
sparing was achieved through combination with AS03 adjuvant. This CC-H5N1 might
contribute to the rapid access of vaccine in the event of an influenza A(H5N1)
pandemic.
