Gene therapy (GT) of cancer represents one of the most promising and exciting
innovations in contemporary medicine. Several different strategies of GT of
cancer have been developed. In spite of the rapid methodological progress their
exploitation encounters a variety of problems. The most pertinent are associated 
with the use of vectors for gene transfer. Nowadays, virus-based vectors are
preferred to the physical-chemical approaches. A special position in the
methodology of cancer GT belongs to the so-called suicide genes. The expression
of these genes in tumour cells results in their death provided they have been
exposed to certain, originally innocuous substances. Combination of suicide genes
with those coding for cytokines may eventually yield a very efficient means both 
for prevention and treatment of cancer. GT is connected with a number of
considerable scientific, organizational and ethical problems. Coping with them
requires extraordinary effort and well-organized and deliberate international
cooperation.
