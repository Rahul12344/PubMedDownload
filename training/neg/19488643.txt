OBJECTIVE: To investigate seroprevalence of rubella antibodies in a 15 to 39 year
old population in the municipal district of Guaratinguetá.
METHODS: The 996 samples studied were collected in urban and rural zones, after
informed and elucidated consent from men and women stratified by age (15 -39
years). Rubella IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA using the commercial kit
Rubenostika IgGII (Organon Teknika THE, Holland). Age groups were stratified in 3
categories: 15-19; 20-29 and 30-39 years of age. Statistical analyses were
accomplished with the software MINITAB version 14.0 (Minitab Inc, USA).
RESULTS: The proportion of seropositives for antibodies of the IgG class were:
92.7.% positive for 15-19 years; 82.4% for 20 to 29 years and 90.7% for 30-39
years, with a significant difference in the seropositive proportions by age group
(p <0.001). Variation of intensity of antibody response was calculated and
results show a significant difference (p = 0.002) between means of the 3 age
groups studied. In relation to rural and urban zone average of the ratio DO/CO
for each age group, a significant tendency towards a lower average was observed
in the rural zone. The same was true when the seropositive proportions were
calculated.
CONCLUSION: Results showed that the percentage and individuals with antibodies of
the IgG class against rubella in the 20-29 year age group was lower than that in 
the younger and older age groups. Furthermore, the difference between
seropositivity in the urban and rural zones discloses susceptibility with a
potential for continued circulation of the virus in this zone.
