The Epstein-Barr virus thwarts immune surveillance through a Gly-Ala repeat (GAr)
within the viral Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1 protein. The GAr
inhibits proteasome processing, an early step in antigen peptide presentation,
but the mechanism of proteasome inhibition has been unclear. By embedding a GAr
within ornithine decarboxylase, a natural proteasome substrate that does not
require ubiquitin conjugation, we now demonstrate inhibition in a purified
system, excluding involvement of ubiquitin conjugation or of proteins extraneous 
to substrate and proteasome. We show further that the GAr acts as a stop-transfer
signal in proteasome substrate processing, resulting in vivo in partial
proteolysis that halts just short of the GAr. Similarly, introducing a GAr into
green fluorescent protein destabilized by the ornithine decarboxylase degradation
domain also stops the progress of proteolysis, leading to the accumulation of
partial degradation products. We postulate that the ATP motor of the proteasome
slips when it encounters the GAr, impeding further insertion and, in this way,
halting degradation.
