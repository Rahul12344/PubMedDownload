The replication of type A influenza viruses in the infant rat: a marker for virus
attenuation.

Jennings R, Potter CW, Teh CZ, Mahmud MI.

Twenty recombinant influenza virus strains bearing HSw1N1, H1N1 or H3N2 surface
antigens, together with their respective wild-type or laboratory-propagated
parent viruses, were inoculated into 2 day-old infant rats and their replication 
in the turbinates and lungs of these animals observed over a period of 5 days. In
addition, the ability of each of the recombinant and parent viruses to enhance a 
subsequent infection of these infant rats by Haemophilus influenzae type b was
determined. The results showed that both parent and recombinant viruses
replicated less well in the lungs than in the turbinates of infant rats, but the 
titres in both tissues were generally lower for the recombinant strains. The
capacity of the majority of the recombinant influenza viruses to promote
bacterial infection of the infant rats, as determined by the incidence of H.
influenzae bacteraemia and meningitis, was also markedly less than that of their 
parent viruses. A correlation between virulence for man and both the replication 
in infant rat turbinates and the ability to enhance H. influenzae infection, was 
established for the virus strains studied. The data are discussed in relationship
to the value of the infant r-H influenzae system as a laboratory marker for the
determination of the virulence of influenza virus strains.
