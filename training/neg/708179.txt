Aplastic anemia associated with type B viral hepatitis.

Casciato DA, Klein CA, Kaplowitz N, Scott JL.

Aplastic anemia is a recognized complication of viral hepatitis, but, to our
knowledge, no cases associated with type B hepatitis have been described. We
report the case of a patient who developed severe aplastic anemia very early in
the course of infection with hepatitis B virus.
