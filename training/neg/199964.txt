alpha-L-Iduronidase activity in established lymphoblastoid cells from patients
with Hurler and Scheie syndromes transformed by Epstein-Barr virus.

alpha-L-Iduronidase activity was determined in established lymphoblastoid cells, 
which were transformed in vitro by Epstein-Barr virus, of lymphocytes-rich cell
populations isolated from peripheral blood of patients with Hurler and Scheie
syndromes. alpha-L-Iduronidase activities in established lymphoblastoid cells
from patients were undetectable, while activities of control subjects were
clearly detected. These results suggest that established lymphoblastoid cells are
useful for the enzymatic study of genetic mucopolysaccharidoses.
