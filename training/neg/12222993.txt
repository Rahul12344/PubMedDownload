Within the past decade, gene therapy strategies have come to the forefront of
novel therapeutics. Tremendous advances in vector technology along with deeper
understandings of vector biology and the molecular mechanisms of disease have
significantly advanced the field of human gene therapy. This manuscript will
discuss the viral-based subset of current gene transfer vectors. In particular,
the most established viral vectors to date, including parvovirus, adenovirus,
retrovirus, lentivirus, and herpesvirus-based vectors, are described, as well as 
the current innovative improvements being made to each. From past experience, it 
has become evident that in addition to optimising the vectors in terms of
transgene expression, minimising vector-related immunology, and vector
production, methods of vector delivery resulting in optimum vector transduction
of target cells need to be established. This review will also illustrate several 
current improved physical delivery systems for optimal vector administration.
