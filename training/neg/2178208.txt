The response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, both cellular and humoral, is
dependent on the host's immunocompetence. Understanding of this response is
particularly helpful in supporting a clinical diagnosis of CMV infection. This
article briefly reviews the immune response to CMV infection in different
clinical settings. Numerous test systems have been adapted for measurement of
antibody to CMV. The commonly available assays are reviewed and their advantages 
and limitations highlighted. Based on this information it is possible to select
the most appropriate test kit for particular situations.
