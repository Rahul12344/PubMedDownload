Viral communities of two different salt pans located in the Namib Desert, Hosabes
and Eisfeld, were investigated using a combination of multiple displacement
amplification of metaviromic DNA and deep sequencing, and provided comprehensive 
sequence data on both ssDNA and dsDNA viral community structures. Read and contig
annotations through online pipelines showed that the salt pans harbored largely
unknown viral communities. Through network analysis, we were able to assign a
large portion of the unknown reads to a diverse group of ssDNA viruses. Contigs
belonging to the subfamily Gokushovirinae were common in both environmental
datasets. Analysis of haloarchaeal virus contigs revealed the presence of three
contigs distantly related with His1, indicating a possible new lineage of
salterproviruses in the Hosabes playa. Based on viral richness and read mapping
analyses, the salt pan metaviromes were novel and most closely related to each
other while showing a low degree of overlap with other environmental viromes.
