Cloning and expression of the phage Mu A gene.

Roulet R, Allet B, Chandler M.

We have cloned the phage Mu A gene, with and without the gene ner, under the
control of the pL promoter of phage lambda in a multicopy plasmid vector. We
demonstrate that plasmid-carrying cells are able to support growth of
superinfecting Mu A am phages in a temperature-dependent fashion in a host strain
carrying a defective lambda prophage which specifies the cI857-coded lambda
repressor. In addition, we show that the presence of the ner gene reduces the
efficiency of plating of the superinfecting phage. Analysis of proteins specified
by the cloned Mu fragments indicates that two proteins, 70 and 33 kDal, are
synthesized. The level of synthesis, compared to that of the vector-encoded
beta-lactamase, was found to increase with temperature. This indicates that their
transcription is driven by the pL promoter. The Mr of the 70-kDal protein is
identical to that previously observed for pA.
