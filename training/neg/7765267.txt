We have established two simple, reliable, economical and time-saving methods, one
for plasmid and phagemid DNAs another for bacteriophage DNAs, that can be applied
for any desired scale of vector and its recombinant DNAs preparation. The methods
require neither toxic chemicals nor expensive enzymes or chemical reagents. In
case of the small-scale preparation, the entire procedure can be done in one
microfuge tube. The A260/A280 values for isolated DNAs were constantly between
1.60 and 1.85. The isolated plasmid or phagemid DNA can be used for restriction
digestion, religation, transformation, construction of deletion mutants,
sequencing, PCR and in vitro transcription. The double-stranded and
single-stranded phage DNAs prepared from the present method have the quality to
serve as good templates for PCR and site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
