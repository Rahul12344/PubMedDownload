Swine influenza is an acute respiratory disease of pigs caused by influenza A
virus (IAV) and characterized by fever followed by lethargy, anorexia, and serous
nasal discharge. The disease progresses rapidly and may be complicated when
associated with other respiratory pathogens. IAV is one of the most prevalent
respiratory pathogens of swine, resulting in substantial economic burden to pork 
producers. In the past 10-15 years, a dramatic evolution of the IAV in U.S. swine
has occurred, resulting in the co-circulation of many antigenically distinct IAV 
strains, derived from 13 phylogenetically distinct hemagglutinin clusters of H1
and H3 viruses. Vaccination is the most common strategy to prevent influenza in
pigs, however, the current diverse IAV epidemiology poses a challenge for the
production of efficacious and protective vaccines. A concern regarding the use of
traditional inactivated vaccines is the possibility of inducing
vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) when vaccine virus
strains are mismatched with the infecting strain. In this review, we discuss the 
current epidemiology and pathogenesis of swine influenza in the United States,
different vaccines platforms with potential to control influenza in pigs, and the
factors associated with vaccine-associated disease enhancement.
