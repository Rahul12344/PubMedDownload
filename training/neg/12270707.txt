We applied phage display technology to DNA-protein interaction studies. A cDNA
expression library displayed on the surface of bacteriophage lambda was generated
from the highly differentiated MMH E14 murine hepatic cell line. Selection of
this library using the promoter sequence of the liver-enriched transcription
factor HNF1alpha gene as ligate identified DNA-binding domains specifically
interacting with different regions of this regulatory sequence. One of the
selected phage showed 100% identity to a DNA-binding domain shared by
differentiation specific element-binding protein, vasoactive intestinal peptide
receptor-repressor protein and replication factor C and was further investigated.
Specific binding of the selected protein domain was confirmed in a
phage-independent context. By combining ELISA and South-Western assays using the 
selected phage and a bacterially expressed glutathione-S-transferase protein
fused to the encoded DNA-binding domain, an array of multiple adjacent
DNA-binding sites sharing a common consensus motif was identified. The strategy
described represents a powerful tool to identify proteins that bind to DNA
regulatory elements.
