OBJECTIVES: HIV-related enhancement of gut microbial translocation is associated 
with progression of hepatic fibrosis. Although hepatic macrophages (Kupffer
cells) clear most microbial translocation products and can be infected by HIV,
their fate in HIV progression has not been carefully investigated.
METHODS: We studied Kupffer cell density (KCD) in 76 HIV-hepatitis C virus
coinfected patients investigated at various stages of liver disease and CD4(+)
lymphocyte depletion (and restoration).
RESULTS: KCD averaged 23 cells per high-powered field (range 4.4-52.2) and was
highest in portal and periportal regions as compared with centrilobular regions
(P < 0.001). No differences were detected in KCD by age, liver fibrosis stage, or
hepatic inflammatory score. Compared with individuals without apparent
HIV-related immunosuppression, however, KCD was substantially lower in persons
with lower peripheral blood CD4(+) lymphocyte counts (P = 0.027) and lowest among
those with deepest CD4(+) lymphocyte nadir (P = 0.006). After the initial liver
biopsy, eight patients began antiretroviral therapy and had immune restoration (>
or = 2-fold increase in peripheral CD4(+) lymphocyte count) and a second
histologic evaluation with a median of 36.8 months later (range 28.1-58.4
months); KCD increased in all (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Given the central role of Kupffer cells in controlling microbial
translocation, these data suggest Kupffer cell loss needs to be considered in the
pathogenesis of liver fibrosis in HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfected persons. The
abundance of portal and periportal Kupffer cells is suggestive of their
contribution to fibrosis in periportal regions in chronic viral hepatitis.
