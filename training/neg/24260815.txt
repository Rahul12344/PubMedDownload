In spite of the great technological progress achieved worldwide, still arthropod 
borne infectious diseases is a puzzle disturbing the health authorities. Among
these arthropods, mosquitoes from medical, veterinary and economic point of view 
top all groups. They are estimated to transmit disease to more than 700 million
people annually worldwide mainly in Africa, South America, Central America,
Mexico and much of Asia with millions of deaths. In Europe, Russia, Greenland,
Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other temperate and 
developed countries, mosquito bites are now mostly an irritating nuisance; but
still cause some deaths each year. Mosquito-borne diseases include Malaria, West 
Nile Virus, Elephantiasis, Rift Valley Fever, Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever and Dog 
Heartworm....etc. Apart from diseases transmission, mosquitoes can make human
life miserable. The successful long term mosquito control requires the ecological
and biological knowledge of where and how they develop. The importance of
mosquitoes is given herein to clarify the problem and to think together what one 
must do?
