Treatment options for recurrent or refractory head and neck cancer are limited.
The goal of gene therapy is to introduce new genetic material into cancer cells
without affecting toxicity to surrounding malignant cells. The most common
vehicles for delivery of genes are adenoviruses. Adenoviruses gain access to
malignant and normal cell cytoplasm via viral ligand binding to a unique cell
surface receptor (the coxsackie adenovirus receptor [CAR]). However, this
receptor is not cancer specific. Genetic modification of adenoviral DNA can
create cancer specific targeting. Adenoviruses can be modified to express cancer 
specific ligands thereby focusing binding to malignant tissue. Furthermore,
adenoviral delivered genes can be put under cancer specific promoter control to
further limit gene expression in malignant tissue. Increased antitumour activity 
from such modifications has been demonstrated preclinically and several clinical 
trials have been completed demonstrating safety and clinical activity of
non-replicating and conditional replicating adenoviral vector thereby opening the
door for gene delivery and cancer specific targeting.
