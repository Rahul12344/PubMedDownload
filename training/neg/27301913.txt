Chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis are major sources of morbidity and
mortality in the United States. Little is known about the epidemiology of these
two diseases in ethnic minority populations in the United States. We examined the
prevalence of CLD and cirrhosis by underlying etiologies among African Americans,
Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latinos, and whites in the Multiethnic
Cohort. CLD and cirrhosis cases were identified using Medicare claims between
1999 and 2012 among the fee-for-service participants (n = 106,458). We used
International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision codes, body mass index,
history of diabetes mellitus, and alcohol consumption from questionnaires to
identify underlying etiologies. A total of 5,783 CLD (3,575 CLD without cirrhosis
and 2,208 cirrhosis) cases were identified. The prevalence of CLD ranged from
3.9% in African Americans and Native Hawaiians to 4.1% in whites, 6.7% in
Latinos, and 6.9% in Japanese. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) was the
most common cause of CLD in all ethnic groups combined (52%), followed by
alcoholic liver disease (21%). NAFLD was the most common cause of cirrhosis in
the entire cohort. By ethnicity, NAFLD was the most common cause of cirrhosis in 
Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Latinos, accounting for 32% of cases.
Alcoholic liver disease was the most common cause of cirrhosis in whites (38.2%),
while hepatitis C virus was the most common cause in African Americans
(29.8%).CONCLUSIONS: We showed racial/ethnic variations in the prevalence of CLD 
and cirrhosis by underlying etiology; NAFLD was the most common cause of CLD and 
cirrhosis in the entire cohort, and the high prevalence of NAFLD among Japanese
Americans and Native Hawaiians is a novel finding, warranting further studies to 
elucidate the causes. (Hepatology 2016;64:1969-1977).
