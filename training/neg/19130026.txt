MS is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS)
characterized by demyelination, axonal damage and neurologic disability. The
primary cause of this CNS disease remains elusive. Here we will address our
current understanding of the role of viruses as potential environmental triggers 
for MS. Virus infections can act peripherally (outside the CNS) or within the
CNS. The association of viral infections with demyelinating disease, in both
animals and humans, will be discussed, as will the potential contributions of
peripheral infection with Torque Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within
the CNS with Epstein-Barr virus and infection within the CNS with Human
Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal model, Theiler's murine
encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of mice is an example of
viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for demyelination. Finally, the
proposition that multiple virus infections are required, which first prime the
immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where infections outside
of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, for the development of a 
MS-like disease is explored.
