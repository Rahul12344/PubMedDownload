In general, the biological and structural properties of the hepatitis delta virus
resemble those of the viroids and related satellite RNA viruses of plants. This
resemblance has been strengthened by the discovery that, in analogy to the
self-cleaving of some plant RNA viruses, hepatitis delta virus RNA possesses
autocleaving and autoligating sites located in sequences that are homologous with
highly conserved domains in the viroids. The catalytic properties identify the
hepatitis delta virus as the first mammalian ribozyme. The current interpretation
of the pathobiology of delta hepatitis rests on the postulates that the hepatitis
delta virus invariably requires hepatitis B virus for infection and is highly
pathogenic. Accordingly, delta hepatitis is thought to occur when hepatitis delta
virus coinfects with hepatitis B virus or when it superinfects hepatitis B virus 
carriers. However, new evidence from the liver transplantation model suggests
that hepatitis delta virus is capable of establishing latent, asymptomatic
infections without the apparent assistance of hepatitis B virus: in this model,
disease was only reactivated when hepatitis B virus also returned to the graft.
Thus, hepatitis B virus superinfection on a latent hepatitis delta virus state
may be a third pathobiological mechanism conducive to delta hepatitis.
