The diagnostic laboratories in India are progressively promoting higher standards
and are moving towards accreditation and international acceptance. Hence, the
concept of "Quality" will need to be understood and implemented. Total quality
management (TQM) in a laboratory is an integrated program involving all
laboratory staff and management. TQM is a framework to operate and it is aiming
for integration, consistency, increase in efficiency and a continuous drive for
improvement. A well structured clinical virology service will include serology
setup, cell culture facility and capacity for molecular diagnosis. The quality of
results from the laboratory is significantly influenced by many pre-analytical
and post-analytical factors which needed attention. The end goal of the TQM
should be to provide the best care possible for the patient.
