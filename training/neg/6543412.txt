Evidence for a change in capsid morphology during Sindbis virus envelopment.

Coombs K, Brown B, Brown DT.

Sindbis virus nucleocapsids were isolated from intact virus particles and from
the cytoplasms of infected cells. These two isolates of purified nucleocapsids
differed from one another in ribonuclease sensitivity and in sedimentation
velocity. These findings suggest that a conformational change takes place in the 
Sindbis virus nucleocapsid during envelopment.
