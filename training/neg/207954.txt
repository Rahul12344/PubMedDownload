A survey of rotavirus associated with gastroenteritis in Aboriginal children in
Western Australia.

Schnagl RD, Holmes IH, Mackay-Scollay EM.

In a year-long survey which was carried out between April, 1975, and March, 1976,
faecal specimens from Aboriginal and some non-Aboriginal children who suffered
from gastroenteritis were examined by electron microscopy for rotavirus, and also
tested for bacteria and parasites. The children were under six years of age and
came from all parts of Western Australia, except Perth. Rotaviruses,
"astroviruses" and adenoviruses were detected as well as the usual potentially
pathogenic bacteria and parasites. Two peaks of rotavirus incidence were found
during the year in specimens from Kalgoorlie, but only one peak occurred in
Derby. Rotavirus was somewhat more frequently seen in non-Aboriginal than
Aboriginal children.
