Innate immune responses are known to influence the subsequent development of
adaptive immunity. We have previously shown that RSV infection of human airway
epithelial cells results in production of the B cell growth factor, BAFF. To
better understand how the airway responds to RSV infection by production of this 
and other factors to support or enhance local B cell responses to infection, we
analysed the lung expression of BAFF and B cell homeostatic chemokines CXCL12,
CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21 in a murine model of RSV infection. Following infection
with A2 strain RSV, the highest RSV N gene expression was observed at day 4 after
challenge with virus. In contrast, two peaks of elevated BAFF expression at days 
2 and 7 were observed. CXCL13 was significantly elevated at days 1, 2 and 7.
CXCL12, CCL19 and CCL21 were expressed within lung tissue from control and RSV
challenged animals but no significant difference in expression was found.
Immunofluorescence showed BAFF to be present throughout the tissue however CXCL13
expression was localized to cell rich areas probably constituting lymphoid
aggregates. Our results define the kinetics of B cell chemoattractant and growth 
factor expression during RSV infection and indicate an important role for these
cytokines in the airway response to RSV infection.
