Choristoneura fumiferana granulovirus (ChfuGV) infection results two types of
enveloped virions: Occlusion-derived virus (ODV) and budded virus (BV).
Structural proteins ODVP-6E/ODV-E56 and p74 are two major conserved
ODV-associated proteins that may be involved in the initiation of viral infection
cycle in susceptible host insect larvae. This study presents the characterization
of ChfuGV odvp-6e/odv-e56 and p74 transcription and translation as well as
immunolocalization of these proteins in the occluded ChfuGV virion. Our results
revealed that the transcription of odvp-6e/odv-e56 and p74 genes, both, start at 
24 hours post infection (h p.i.). Using monospecific polyclonal antibodies made
against ODVP-6E/ODV-E56 and p74 we demonstrated that these proteins are both
expressed late in infection (24 h p.i.). Immunogold labeling using antisera
against ODVP-6E/ODV-E56 and p74 proteins demonstrated that ODVP-6E/ODV-E56 and
p74 proteins are both associated with the ODV envelop of ChfuGV.
