OBJECTIVES: Establishment of an in vitro model to evaluate rectal safety and the 
efficacy of microbicide candidates.
DESIGN: An investigation and characterization of human colorectal explant culture
for screening candidate microbicides to prevent rectal transmission of HIV-1
infection.
METHODS: Human colorectal explants were cultured at the liquid-air interface on
gelfoam rafts. Phenotypic characterization of HIV-1 target cells was performed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. HIV-1 infection was determined by
the measurement of p24 antigen release, viral RNA, and proviral DNA accumulation.
RESULTS: Colorectal explant CD4 T cells expressed higher CCR5 and CXCR4 levels
compared with blood. Minor differences between the rectal and sigmoid colon were 
observed with a trend for slightly higher CCR5 and HLA-DR expression in cells
from the sigmoid colon. Favourable culture conditions were established for
colorectal tissue. Although tissue structure degenerated with time, CD4: CD8 cell
ratios remained constant, and tissue supported productive HIV-1 infection. The
ability of candidate microbicides to inhibit R5 HIV-1 infection was evaluated.
Polyanion candidates, PRO2000 and dextrin sulphate, provided 99% protection at 1 
microg/ml and 1 mg/ml, respectively, equivalent to 1/5000 and 1/40 of the vaginal
formulations. The nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
9-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (PMPA) provided protection at
concentrations 1000-fold lower (10 microg/ml) than the proposed vaginal
formulation (1%). Furthermore, non-NRTI UC-781 and TMC-120 provided greater than 
99% inhibition at 3.3 or 0.33 microg/ml, respectively. No products demonstrated
toxicity to rectal mucosa at inhibitory concentrations.
CONCLUSION: Colorectal explant culture was shown to be a useful tool for the
preclinical evaluation of potential microbicides. The data suggest that rectally 
applied microbicides might provide protection from HIV-1 transmission.
