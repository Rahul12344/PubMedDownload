The monomorphic clinical aspect of destructive mid-face lesions is characterised 
by inflammation, induration and granulomatous transformation. This feature can be
caused by various infections, toxical noxa, Wegener's Granulomatosis and
different neoplasms. The case of a 19 year old patient with EBV associated nasal 
type T-cell lymphoma located at the hard palate is presented. The diagnostic
approach and difficulties in diagnosing this entity assessing by using multiple
biopsies, serological and molecularbiological detection of EBV association and
immunohistochemistry for atypic T-cells are elucidated. In the presented case the
treatment with chemotherapy and irradiation following a well-defined therapy
concept leaded to a three year recurrence-free survival so far. The comparison of
the key-histological findings and the major differential diagnoses is mandatory
to establish the final diagnosis of lymphoma. This is the basement for treating
this disease with combined chemotherapy and irradiation for optimizing survival.
