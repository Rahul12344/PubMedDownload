In 1995, an outbreak of tuberculosis (TB) occurred among residents of a
correctional-facility housing unit for inmates infected with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We isolated and treated patients who were suspected
to have TB. To determine risk factors for in-prison transmission of TB, we
conducted a case-control study to compare inmate case patients infected with a
distinct outbreak strain of TB with control subjects who resided in the HIV unit.
We identified 15 case patients during a 4-month period. Among inmates with a CD4 
count of <100 cells/mm(3), case patients were more likely than control subjects
to spend >/=20 hours per week in a communal day room (odds ratio, 42; P=.002) and
were less likely to have a television in their single-person room (odds ratio,
0.10; P=.003). The communal day room was a likely site of transmission.
Successful collaboration between the correctional system and public health
departments halted the outbreak.
