OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic interactions of
ezetimibe in HIV-infected patients with poorly controlled
antiretroviral-associated dyslipidaemia while taking pravastatin alone.
DESIGN: A prospective, open-label, one-arm study of 24 weeks duration.
PATIENTS AND SETTING: Nineteen patients (18 on stable HAART), with low density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol values of > or = 130 mg/dl despite the use of
pravastatin.
METHODS: Ezetimibe, 10 mg/day, was added to pravastatin 20 mg/day, while patients
maintained the same antiretroviral regimen. Determinations of total, LDL-, and
high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, apoproteins, and
inflammatory factors (homocystein and C-reactive protein) were performed at
baseline, and at weeks 6, 12, and 24. Liver enzymes and creatinine phosphokinase 
were also assessed. Protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) Cmin was determined just before and 12 weeks
after ezetimibe introduction.
RESULTS: At week 24, 61.5% of patients achieved the endpoint of the study
(LDL-cholesterol < 130 mg/dl). Significant declines in mean total and
LDL-cholesterol levels were observed between baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 24,
irrespective of antiretroviral type (PI or NNRTI). Mean HDL-cholesterol and
apoprotein A increased significantly. No patients discontinued therapy due to
intolerance or presented toxicity of grade 2 or more. No differences were
observed in lopinavir or nevirapine Cmin measured just before and 12 weeks after 
ezetimibe introduction.
CONCLUSION: The addition of ezetimibe to ongoing pravastatin seems to be an
effective and safe option for HIV-infected patients not achieving the NCEP ATPIII
LDL-cholesterol goals while receiving a statin alone. Its high tolerability and
the lack of interactions with the cytochrome CYP3A4 indicate that ezetimibe will 
not increase the risk of toxicity or pharmacokinetic interactions with
antiretrovirals.
