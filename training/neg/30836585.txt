Viruses have been detected in a limited number of foods. Although methods used to
examine these foods were usually restricted to detection of human enteroviruses, 
animal viruses were found in some meats, milk, and eggs; limitations in
methodology may have caused other viruses present to go undetected. As the
sensitivity of methods increases, studies are being undertaken to detect a
greater variety of human intestinal viruses. Data from these investigations
should provide the information needed to determine the incidence and public
health significance of food contamination by viruses. In areas where
virus-contaminated foods may be expected, washing and heating foods to 70 C
should provide reasonable protection against the inadvertent consumption of
viruses.
