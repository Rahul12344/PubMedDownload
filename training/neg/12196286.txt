Several gamma-herpesviruses encode homologs of host regulators of complement
activation (RCA) proteins, suggesting that they have evolved immune evasion
strategies targeting complement. We evaluated the role of complement factor C3
(C3) and the murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) RCA protein in viral
pathogenesis. Deletion of the gammaHV68 RCA protein decreased virulence during
acute CNS infection, and this attenuation was specifically reversed by deletion
of host C3. The gammaHV68 RCA protein was also important for persistent viral
replication and virulence in IFNgammaR(-/-) mice. In addition, C3 played a role
in regulating latency, but this was not counteracted by the gammaHV68 RCA
protein. We conclude that complement is a key host defense against
gamma-herpesvirus infection and that gamma-herpesviruses have evolved an immune
evasion strategy that is effective against complement-mediated antiviral
responses during acute but not latent infection.
