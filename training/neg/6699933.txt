Sequence homology between the structural proteins of Kilham rat virus.

Brown DD, Salzman LA.

The capsid proteins of the autonomous parvovirus Kilham rat virus were purified
and analyzed for peptide composition. Partial proteolysis mapping and
two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography of tryptic peptide digests revealed
extensive amino acid sequence homology between the two major Kilham rat virus
capsid proteins.
