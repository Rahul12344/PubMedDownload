BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of gastrointestinal infections caused by small round
structured viruses (SRSV) has relied upon electron microscopy and
antigen/antibody assays based on Norwalk virus. We investigated cases of
gastroenteritis associated with SRSVs employing a new sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using hyperimmune animal anti-sera against
recombinant Mexico virus capsid protein (rMXV).
STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and thirty-five specimens from 86 episodes of
gastroenteritis associated with SRSVs, collected in the UK between October 1993
and September 1994, were tested in the rMXV assay.
RESULTS: Forty-seven (35%) specimens from 35 of 86 (41%) episodes were positive
in the rMXV ELISA and these could further be divided into high and low reactors. 
Sequencing of a 266-base region of the RNA polymerase gene revealed that strains 
highly reactive in the rMXV assay demonstrated a high degree of similarity to MXV
(97-99% at the nucleotide level), whereas low-reactive strains consist of
Mexico-like strains and a heterogeneous group of viruses exhibiting 70-75%
similarity to MXV.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the rMXV ELISA is predominantly a type
specific assay, although some cross reactivity with other genogroup 2 SRSVs was
observed. MXV was responsible for 26% of SRSV-associated gastrointestinal
infections investigated in the UK during one year's surveillance.
