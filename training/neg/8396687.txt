Herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) was used to infect and transform human CD8+ cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL), and the phenotypic and functional consequences of HVS
infection of CD8+ T lymphocytes were investigated. HVS-transformed CTL no longer 
require antigen restimulation yet maintain their phenotype and HLA-restricted
cytolytic function and specificity. The ability of HVS to transform CTL may have 
an important role in the functional analysis of human antigen-specific CTL.
