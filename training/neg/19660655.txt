Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are currently the preeminent gene therapy
vehicles for neurological application. However, issues regarding the trafficking 
of AAV vectors within the primate brain, and consequently control over the
targeting of transgene expression, remain a matter of investigation. Studies in
nonhuman primates have shown that distribution of AAV vectors is largely mediated
by the flow of cerebrospinal fluid within perivascular space, trafficking of
vector along axonal projections, and AAV receptor binding. Together these
processes can result in transduction of cells in areas distant from the
parenchymal site of infusion. Additionally, we have addressed the unique surgical
issues concerning delivery of AAV vectors by convection-enhanced delivery and are
working toward tailored delivery by means of real-time MRI.
