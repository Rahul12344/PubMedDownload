The alterations of avian influenza A virus haemagglutinin (HA) H2 as a result of 
adaptation to mice were first investigated in this study. HA of mouse-adapted
(MA) variant was somewhat different from that of the original strain in
electrophoretical mobility, antigenic structure and in haemagglutination activity
with mouse red blood cells.
