Obesity has become a universal and major public health problem with increasing
prevalence in both adults and children in the 21st century, even in developing
countries. Extensive epidemiological studies reveal a strong link between obesity
and development and progression of various types of cancers. The connection
between obesity and liver cancer is particularly strong and obesity often results
in liver diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more 
severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is characterized by fatty liver
inflammation and is believed to cause fibrosis and cirrhosis. The latter is a
known liver cancer risk factor. In fact due to its much higher prevalence obesity
may be a more substantial contributor to overall hepatocellular carcinoma burden 
than infection with hepatitis viruses. Here we review and discuss recent advances
in elucidation of cellular and molecular alterations and signaling pathways
associated with obesity and liver inflammation and their contribution to
hepatocarcinogenesis.
