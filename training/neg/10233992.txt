Measles virus (MV) has a tropism restricted to humans and primates and uses the
human CD46 molecule as a cellular receptor. MV has been adapted to grow in
chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF) and gave rise to an attenuated live vaccine. 
Hallé and Schwarz MV strains were compared in their ability to infect both simian
Vero cells and CEF. Whereas both strains infected Vero cells, only the
CEF-adapted Schwarz strain was able to efficiently infect CEF. Since the
expression of the human MV receptor CD46 rendered the chicken embryonic cell line
TCF more permissive to the infection by the Hallé MV strain, the MV entry into
CEF appeared to be a limiting step in the absence of prior MV adaptation. CEF
lacked reactivity with anti-CD46 antibodies but were found to express another
protein allowing MV binding as an alternative receptor to CD46.
