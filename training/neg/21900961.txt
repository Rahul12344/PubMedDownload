The safety and toxicokinetics of SCH 721015, an adenovirus encoding the human
interferon alpha-2b gene, and Syn3 (SCH 209702), a novel excipient, were assessed
in cynomolgus monkeys administered intravesical doses of 2.5 × 10E11 or 1.25 ×
10E13 particles SCH 721015 in 25 mg Syn3 or 25 mg Syn3 alone on study days 1 and 
91. There was no systemic toxicity. Monkeys dosed with SCH 721015 in Syn3 were
positive for SCH 721015-specific DNA in the urine for 2 to 3 days following each 
dose and had interferon alpha-2b protein in the urine for 1-3 days after a single
dose and in fewer animals after a second dose. Intracystic administration was
associated with inflammation and focal/multifocal ulceration in the urinary
bladder and irritation in the ureters and urethra at necropsy. The physical
trauma from catheterization and filling/emptying of the bladder was likely a
contributing factor and Syn3 exacerbated the trauma. There was nearly complete
resolution of these findings 2 months after the last dose. The trauma to the
bladder likely contributed to low, transient systemic exposure to Syn3, SCH
721015 and human interferon protein. The results of this study support the
clinical investigation of SCH 721015 in Syn3.
