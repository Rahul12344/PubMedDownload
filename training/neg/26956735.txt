Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk for
infections. Vaccination is a powerful tool to prevent infections, even in
immunocompromised patients. Most non-live vaccines are immunogenic and safe in
patients with SLE, even if antibody titres are frequently lower than those of
healthy controls. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are more prevalent in SLE
patients when compared to the healthy population. Low-risk types of this virus
cause anogenital warts, while high risk types are strongly related to
pre-malignant cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer. HPV vaccines have been 
developed to prevent these conditions. Although little is known about HPV
vaccination in SLE, few studies in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases
(AIRDs) have shown that HPV vaccines are safe, and capable to induce an
immunogenic response in this group of patients. To date, available data suggest
that HPV vaccines can be given safely to SLE patients. Given the increased
incidence of cervical abnormalities due to HPV in SLE patients, this vaccination 
should be encouraged.
