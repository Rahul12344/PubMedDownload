PURPOSE: To report diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction of intraocular
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder in a pediatric renal transplant
patient.
DESIGN: Observational case report.
METHODS: Retrospective review.
RESULTS: An 11-year-old girl developed infectious mononucleosis 15 months after
renal transplantation for focal segmental sclerosis. Papillitis and hypopyon
uveitis developed 8 months later, followed by iris nodules. Diagnosis of
intraocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder was made by polymerase
chain reaction of aqueous humor for Epstein-Barr virus and confirmed by
histopathology of an iris biopsy specimen. Infiltrating iris lymphocytes in the
biopsy specimen were positive for Epstein-Barr DNA. Polymerase chain reaction
also revealed gene rearrangement of the variable region of the heavy
immunoglobulin chain, consistent with a monoclonal B-lymphocyte population. Iris 
nodules resolved with reduction in immunosuppressive medication.
CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction for Epstein-Barr virus may be helpful in
diagnosis of intraocular posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
