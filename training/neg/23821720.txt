The study of the human virome is still in its infancy, especially with regard to 
the viral content of the blood of people who are apparently disease free. In this
study, the genome of a new giant virus that is related to the amoeba-infecting
pathogen Marseillevirus was recovered from donated blood, using high-throughput
sequencing. Viral antigens were identified by an immunoconversion assay. The
virus was visualized with transmission electron microscopy and fluorescence in
situ hybridization and was grown in human T lymphocytes. Specific antibody
reactions were used to identify viral proteins in blood specimens from polymerase
chain reactive-positive donors. Finally, we tested 20 blood specimens from
additional donors. Three had antibodies directed against this virus, and 2 had
circulating viral DNA. This study shows that giant viruses, which are missed by
the use of ultrafilters, are part of the human blood virome. The putative
pathogenic role of giant viruses in humans remains undefined.
