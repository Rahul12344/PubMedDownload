Widespread use of varicella vaccine in the United States has drastically changed 
the epidemiology of the disease. Although chickenpox is no longer a ubiquitous
childhood infection, varicella-zoster virus continues to circulate in the
community and nonimmune pregnant women remain at risk. Varicella can cause severe
infection in pregnant women, often complicated by viral pneumonia. Maternal
varicella occurring in the first half of pregnancy can cause the rare but
devastating congenital varicella syndrome, whereas infection in the late stages
of pregnancy may cause neonatal varicella. The best approach to avoiding the
morbidity and mortality associated with chickenpox in pregnancy is to screen and 
vaccinate susceptible reproductive-age women.
