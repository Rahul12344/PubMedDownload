OBJECTIVE: A liver biopsy is necessary to grade and stage chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection. In a previous study of patients with nonalcoholic liver
disease, an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
ratio >1 suggested cirrhosis. We sought to examine the value of the AST/ALT ratio
in distinguishing cirrhotic patients with chronic HCV infection from noncirrhotic
patients and to correlate the ratio with the grade and stage of hepatitis and
other biochemical indices.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied 139 patients with chronic HCV infection.
Routine biochemical indices were determined, and the histological grade of
necroinflammatory activity and the stage of fibrosis of the liver biopsy
specimens were scored.
RESULTS: The mean AST/ALT ratio in the cirrhotic patients (n = 47) was higher
than in the noncirrhotic patients (n = 92) (1.06 +/- 0.06 vs 0.60 +/- 0.09; p <
0.001). A ratio > or =1 had 100% specificity and positive predictive value in
distinguishing cirrhotic from noncirrhotic patients, with a 53.2% sensitivity and
80.7% negative predictive value. The ratio correlated positively with the stage
of fibrosis but not with the grade of activity or other biochemical indices. Of
the cirrhotic patients, 17% had no clinical or biochemical features suggestive of
chronic liver disease except for an AST/ALT ratio > or =1.
CONCLUSION: The AST/ALT ratio is a dependable marker of fibrosis stage and
cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV infection.
