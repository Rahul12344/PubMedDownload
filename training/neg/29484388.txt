Among all brain tumors diagnosed in children, medulloblastomas (MBs) are
associated with a poor prognosis. The etiology of MB is not fully understood, yet
the impact of epigenetic alterations of oncogenes has previously been
established. During the past decade, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been
detected in several types of cancer, including MB. Since DNA methylation occurs
in the cell nucleus and this is considered a host defence response, we studied
the impact of HCMV infection on DNA methyltransferase (DNMT‑1) in MB (D324)
cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as well as in MB tissue
sections. We hypothesized that infection and DNMT‑1 intracellular localization
are linked. Uninfected and HCMV‑infected D324 cells and HUVECs were analyzed for 
HCMV immediate early (HCMV‑IE) protein, HCMV‑glycoprotein B (HCMV‑gB) and DNMT‑1 
using immunofluorescence staining and quantitative ELISA. DNMT‑1 localized to the
nucleus of uninfected and HCMV‑IE- expressing D324 cells and HUVECs, but
accumulated in the extra nuclear space in all HCMV‑gB-positive cells. Inhibition 
of HCMV late protein expression by Cymevene® (ganciclovir) prevented the
cytoplasmic localization of DNMT‑1. Treatment of HCMV‑ infected D324 cells and
HUVECs with the methylation inhibitor 5-Azacytidine (5AZA), significantly
increased HCMV‑IE and HCMV‑gB gene transcription and protein expression.
Immunohistochemical staining of DNMT‑1 and HCMV proteins in MB cancer tissue
sections revealed both nuclear and cytoplasmic DNMT‑1 localization. In
conclusion, DNMT‑1 resides in the cytoplasm of HCMV‑gB-expressing HUVECs and D324
cells. Increased viral protein synthesis in 5AZA-treated cells suggests that HCMV
replication may benefit from a DNA methyltransferase-free cellular environment.
Our findings emphasize the importance of assessing potential viral activation in 
the treatment of MB patients with epigenetic drugs.
