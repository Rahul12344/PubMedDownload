Analysis of the catalytic domain of phosphotransferase activity of two avian
sarcoma virus-transforming proteins.

Brugge JS, Darrow D.

Proteolytic digestion of the transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (pp60src)
with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or thermolysin generated a 29,000-dalton fragment
representing the carboxyl half of this molecule. This proteolytic fragment was
able to phosphorylate pp60src-specific immunoglobulin as well as exogenous
substrates such as angiotensin, casein, and tubulin. When quantitated on a molar 
basis, the protease-resistant fragment of pp60src had a greater specific activity
than the intact enzyme. Digestion of pp90yes, the transforming protein of Y73
sarcoma virus with these proteases yielded a peptide of similar molecular weight 
which was capable of autophosphorylation as well as the phosphorylation of
exogenous substrates. The proteolytic fragments of both pp60src and pp90yes
displayed the same strict specificity for phosphorylation of tyrosine as the
intact enzymes. These results indicate that the 29,000-dalton carboxyl end of
pp60src and pp90yes can function independently as phosphotransferases and
indicate that the catalytic domains of these molecules have a conformation which 
confers protection against limited conditions of proteolysis.
