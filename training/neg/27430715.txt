IL-15 has been implicated as a key regulator of T and NK cell homeostasis in
multiple systems; however, its specific role in maintaining peripheral T and NK
cell populations relative to other γ-chain (γc) cytokines has not been fully
defined in primates. In this article, we address this question by determining the
effect of IL-15 inhibition with a rhesusized anti-IL-15 mAb on T and NK cell
dynamics in rhesus macaques. Strikingly, anti-IL-15 treatment resulted in rapid
depletion of NK cells and both CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector memory T cells (TEM) in
blood and tissues, with little to no effect on naive or central memory T cells.
Importantly, whereas depletion of NK cells was nearly complete and maintained as 
long as anti-IL-15 treatment was given, TEM depletion was countered by the onset 
of massive TEM proliferation, which almost completely restored circulating TEM
numbers. Tissue TEM, however, remained significantly reduced, and most TEM
maintained very high turnover throughout anti-IL-15 treatment. In the presence of
IL-15 inhibition, TEM became increasingly more sensitive to IL-7 stimulation in
vivo, and transcriptional analysis of TEM in IL-15-inhibited monkeys revealed
engagement of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, suggesting alternative γc cytokine 
signaling may support TEM homeostasis in the absence of IL-15. Thus, IL-15 plays 
a major role in peripheral maintenance of NK cells and TEM However, whereas most 
NK cell populations collapse in the absence of IL-15, TEM can be maintained in
the face of IL-15 inhibition by the activity of other homeostatic regulators,
most likely IL-7.
