The Toll-like receptor (TLR) family plays an instructive role in innate immune
responses against microbial pathogens, as well as the subsequent induction of
adaptive immune responses. TLRs recognize specific molecular patterns found in a 
broad range of microbial pathogens such as bacteria and viruses, triggering
inflammatory and antiviral responses and dendritic cell maturation, which result 
in the eradication of invading pathogens. Individual TLRs interact with different
combinations of adapter proteins and activate various transcription factors such 
as nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, activating protein-1 and interferon regulatory
factors, driving a specific immune response. This review outlines the recent
advances in our understanding of TLR-signaling pathways and their roles in immune
responses. Further, we also discuss a new concept of TLR-independent mechanisms
for recognition of microbial pathogens.
