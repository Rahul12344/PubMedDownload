Hepatitis flare is rarely observed during treatment with pegylated interferon
alpha for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A 49-year-old man receiving
pegylated interferon α-2a for HCV infection had icterus and hyperbiliru-binemia
in the 14th week of therapy, with HCV RNA undetectable after the 12th dose. Liver
biopsy was suggestive of chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis without interface
pattern. Pegylated interferon was discontinued; a few weeks later, his
aminotransferases and immunoglobulin levels increased significantly. Antibody to 
cytosolic liver antigen-1 was positive, and liver biopsy revealed
lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate with intense interface hepatitis, consistent with
autoimmune hepatitis.
