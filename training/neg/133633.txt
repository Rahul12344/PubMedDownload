Transduction of extrachromosomal markers of resistance to penicillin and
erythromycin in staphylococcal strains isolated from patients was studied. Two
transduction methods were compared, i. e. transduction with a phage filtrate of
the donor culture resistant to erythromycin and transduction on mixed cultivation
of the donor and recipient. A higher transduction rate was observed with the
latter method. Mixed cultivation of the donor cultures resistant to penicillin or
erythromycin and the recipient strains of the wild type sensitive to these
antibiotic resulted in transduction of the respective markers. Transductants
which acquired prophage 6 simultaneously with marker Egg became donors of
erythromycin resistance.
