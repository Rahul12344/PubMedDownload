STUDY OBJECTIVE: Canada has licensed a human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine for
adolescent females, with the goal of decreasing the incidence of HPV infection
and associated cervical cancer. This study identifies the juvenile detainee
population as a high-risk group for HPV infection and therefore an important
target for primary prevention.
DESIGN: A retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Sundance Juvenile Detention Center, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: Female detainees admitted between 2003 and 2006.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Papanicolaou (Pap) test results, sexually transmitted
infection (STI) rates, and associated risk factors were collected from 119
charts.
RESULTS: Of 57 recorded Pap smears, 46 (80.7%) were normal, 5 (8.8%) were
reported as atypical squamous cells of unknown significance, and 6 (10.5%) were
reported as low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion. Of the women tested, 4%
were positive for gonorrhea, 10% for chlamydia, 32% for bacterial vaginosis, and 
5% for trichomonas; none were positive for syphilis. Of the girls, (91) (77%) had
negative HIV and hepatitis B tests, two girls were hepatitis-C-positive, three
had clinical evidence of genital herpes, and one showed evidence of pelvic
inflammatory disease. There were 75 (63%) girls who reported sexual activity; 87%
of them used contraception or protection of some kind, albeit inconsistently. Of 
these young females, 12 (10%) had engaged in prostitution and 13 (11%) had
allegedly been raped or sexually assaulted.
CONCLUSIONS: Female juvenile detainees in Kingston, Ontario, have higher rates of
STIs, associated risk factors, and abnormal Pap tests than the general female
adolescent population. This new information confirms that this population is at
risk for HPV infection and subsequent cervical cancer.
