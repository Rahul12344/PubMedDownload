We developed a model to assess the therapeutic effects of the 45-2D9-ricin
A-chain immunotoxin (RTA) on pulmonary metastases. The 45-2D9 mouse monoclonal
antibody recognizes a Mr 74,000 glycoprotein highly expressed by rat fibroblasts 
transformed with the Kirsten sarcoma virus (transformed rat fibroblasts). These
cells metastasize spontaneously and form lung colonies in nu/nu and irradiated
BALB/c mice. Injection i.v. of 45-2D9-RTA specifically reduced formation of
spontaneous pulmonary metastases and lung colonies originating from freshly
disaggregated tumor cells or cultured cells. Antibody alone or mixed with
unconjugated ricin A chain and an immunotoxin that recognizes a
melanoma-associated antigen were ineffective. Unconjugated 45-2D9 antibody
specifically blocked the 45-2D9-RTA activity in vivo. Administration of the
lysosomotrophic agents ammonium chloride and chloroquine in vivo did not
potentiate immunotoxin-mediated reduction in lung colonies although they were
effective in vitro. Monensin potentiated 45-2D9-RTA activity in vitro and in
vivo.
