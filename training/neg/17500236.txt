The biopolymers extracted from sea hydrocoles were screened and a group of
sulfated polysaccharides--fucoidans having a pronounced inhibitory effect on the 
adsorption of Hantaan virus in the cultured Vero E6 cells was identified. The
mechanism of action of sulfated polysaccharides was realized through competitive 
carbohydrate-specific binding to cell membrane receptors and through
ligand-receptor interaction and blocking of Hantaan virus glycoproteins (G1 and
G2).
