Most BRAF (V600E) mutant melanomas are sensitive to selective BRAF inhibitors,
but BRAF mutant colon cancers are intrinsically resistant to these drugs because 
of feedback activation of EGFR. We performed an RNA-interference-based genetic
screen in BRAF mutant colon cancer cells to search for phosphatases whose
knockdown induces sensitivity to BRAF inhibition. We found that suppression of
protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11) confers sensitivity to
BRAF inhibitors in colon cancer. Mechanistically, we found that inhibition of
PTPN11 blocks signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) to the RAS-MEK-ERK 
pathway. PTPN11 suppression is lethal to cells that are driven by activated RTKs 
and prevents acquired resistance to targeted cancer drugs that results from RTK
activation. Our findings identify PTPN11 as a drug target to combat both
intrinsic and acquired resistance to several targeted cancer drugs. Moreover,
activated PTPN11 can serve as a biomarker of drug resistance resulting from RTK
activation.
