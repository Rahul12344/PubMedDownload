We studied 48 human papillomavirus (HPV)-16-positive squamous intraepithelial
lesions (SILs) from HIV-negative patients (16 low-grade SILs [LSILs]; 32
high-grade SILs [HSILs]) and 13 HPV-16-positive SILs from HIV-positive patients
with AIDS (1 LSIL; 12 HSILs). After HPV typing, the entire HPV-16 E6 coding
region was amplified and sequenced in all samples. We detected 12 HPV-16 E6
prototypes and 4 variants among the LSILs in HIV-negative patients, and 15 HPV-16
E6 prototypes and 17 HPV-16 variants in the HSIL group. The most prevalent
variant of SIL types was European 350G, present in 3 and 13 cases, respectively. 
In 3 HSILs and no LSILs we found mixed infection by an HPV-16 E6 prototype and a 
variant. Two variants (1 each in LSIL and HSIL) were of non-European lineage. The
only LSIL in HIV-positive patients had an HPV-16 E6 prototype; in the HSILs, we
found 8 HPV-16 E6-prototypes, 4 with mixed infection with HPV-31 and 4 variants, 
all European 350G. The higher proportion of HPV-16 E6 variants in HSIL than in
LSIL in HIV-negative patients suggests a greater risk of progression. However,
further studies are needed.
