A sensitive method for the detection and isolation of recombinants of
foot-and-mouth disease virus.

McCahon D, Slade WR.

Recombination between temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD) virus was examined, using an infectious centre technique that was
more sensitive (approx. 30-fold) than the conventional virus yield test. The test
involved a brief incubation of the mixedly infected cells at the permissive
temperature to allow recombination to occur followed by assay at the restrictive 
temperature to select for those cells in which recombination had occurred. With
crosses involving widely separated mutations, as many as 28% of the infected
cells produced presumptive recombinant plaques. Since each plaque was the result 
of an independent event, large numbers of different presumptive recombinants
could be isolated for further study. Analysis of presumptive recombinant plaques 
from a variety of crosses showed that, in general, the virus produced had the
properties expected of recombinants. An approximate correlation was found between
genetic distance, as determined in the yield recombination test, and the
percentage of recombinant infectious centres observed. The phenomenon was very
sensitive to the balance between the input multiplicities of the two parent
viruses and occurred very early in virus replication. The test has considerable
potential for the study of genetic interactions in FMD virus, but it would be
surprising if this potential was limited to picornaviruses.
