OBJECTIVE: To study the particle of hepatitis E virus (HEV) and its significance 
in specific diagnosis for hepatitis E (HE).
METHODS: Four strains of monoclonal antibodies (McAb) against HEV, 5B12, 5F1, 5B9
and 4G10, were prepared with HEV antigen (used as immunogen) expressed by genetic
engineering and detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
with purified synthetic polypeptide antigen.
RESULTS: The monoclonal anti-HEV prefared could produce inhibitory reaction with 
anti-HEV positive serum and combined specifically with HEV particle forming
virus-antibody complex seen clearly under electron microscope.
CONCLUSION: McAb against HEV so prepared with high specificity can be used to
detect and identify HEV.
