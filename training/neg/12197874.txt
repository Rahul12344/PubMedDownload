Biological weapons and biological terrorism have recently come into focus due to 
the deliberate release of Bacillus anthracis via mail delivered in the USA. Since
the 1930s, biological weapons have been developed in a number of countries. In
1975, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention entered into force; this
prohibits the use of these weapons and has been signed by a large majority of
countries (144). Unfortunately, several countries failed to respect this treaty. 
The Soviet Union continued and expanded its biological weapons program, and after
the Gulf War it was revealed that Iraq also had an extensive biological weapons
program. Large-scale deliberate release of, Bacillus anthracis, for example, or
an epidemic following a release of smallpox virus, would have a devastating
effect. This has motivated the world community to strengthen the Biological and
Toxin Weapons Convention with a control mechanism which has, as yet, not been
successful. Sweden, like other countries, is enhancing its preparedness with
regard to stocks of antibiotics and vaccines, related to these improving the
diagnostics these and similar agents, and is setting up an epidemiologic task
force that can be used in infectious disease emergencies such as the deliberate
release of biological warfare agents. International cooperation in this area has 
to be enhanced, not least in the European Union.
