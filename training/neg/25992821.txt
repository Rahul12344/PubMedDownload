OBJECTIVE: To identify vulnerabilities of elderly people with HIV/AIDS and the
trajectory that they follow until reaching the diagnosis of the disease.
METHOD: Qualitative research conducted in specialized clinics in the state of São
Paulo, from January to June 2011. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 
11 elderly people who were found to be infected with the virus at the age of 60
years or older. The interviews were analyzed using content analysis.
RESULTS: In this process four categories emerged, then analyzed with reference to
the theoretical framework of vulnerability.
CONCLUSION: Late diagnosis of HIV infection or AIDS among the elderly happens in 
the secondary or tertiary service. Issues related to sexual life of the elderly
are only questioned by health professionals after the diagnosis, also the time
that condom use becomes absolute. It is believed that the investigation of the
vulnerability of the elderly to HIV/AIDS allows for carrying out appropriate
interventions for this population.
