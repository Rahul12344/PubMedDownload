Susceptibility of human diploid fibroblast strains to transformation by SV40
virus.

Todaro GJ, Green H, Swift MR.

A quantitative system has been developed for the study of transformation of human
diploid fibroblasts in culture by two oncogenic viruses, SV40 and the E46 strain 
of adeno 7-SV40 "hybrid" virus. Seven of the eleven cell strains derived from
human skin biopsies when infected with SV40 (10(9) tissue culture infective doses
per milliliter) gave rise to transformed colonies with approximately the same
frequency (0.03 percent). Two strains derived from patients with Fanconi's
anemia, an autosomal recessive disease associated with a high incidence of
chromosome abnormalities and spontaneous neoplasms, gave values more than ten
times higher. Two strains from persons heterozygous for this gene were also
considerably more susceptible to viral transformation.
