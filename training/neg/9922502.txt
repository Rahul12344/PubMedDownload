The increase of rheumatic disorders in HIV infected has been known for the last
decade with special emphasis on Reiter's Syndrome. In spite of common sources of 
HIV and other microorganisms being important in the pathogenesis of Reiter's
Syndrome, severe immunodeficiency may be important in the development of
rheumatic diseases, mainly because of the presence of arthritogenic
microorganisms. The decrease of TCD4 lymphocytes, the increase of TCD8
lymphocytes and the modification of immune regulation may be important in the
pathogenesis of Reiter's Syndrome in patients infected by HIV. There is no
clinical response to nonhormonal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of this
entity.
