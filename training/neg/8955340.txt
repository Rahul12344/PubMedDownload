A peptide reproducing the G-H loop amino acid sequence of foot-and-mouth disease 
virus VP1 protein was fused to the solvent-exposed C-terminus of the
bacteriophage P22 tailspike protein [Carbonell and Villaverde (1996) Gene, in
press], a homotrimeric polypeptide with a strong beta-helical structure. This
fusion does not interfere with the biological activities of the phage tail. The
antigenic profile of the complex antigenic site A within the G-H loop has been
determined by competitive ELISA with a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed
against different overlapping B-cell epitopes. The antigenic data have been
compared with those obtained with a set of 12 chimeric beta-galactosidases
displaying the G-H loop on different exposed regions. A high coincidence has been
evidenced between the antigenicity of the viral peptide fused to the phage
protein and that of some peptides inserted in an exposed loop of the activating
interface of beta-galactosidase. This indicates that completely different
structural frameworks of carrier proteins can provide similar constraints that
allow the recombinant peptide to successfully mimic the antigenicity, and
probably conformational features, of the natural peptide on the virion surface.
