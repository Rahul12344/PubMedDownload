Memory deficits are characteristic of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND) and co-occur with hippocampal pathology. The HIV-1 transactivator of
transcription (Tat), a regulatory protein, plays a significant role in these
events, but the cellular mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Within the
hippocampus, diverse populations of interneurons form complex networks; even
subtle disruptions can drastically alter synaptic output, resulting in behavioral
dysfunction. We hypothesized that HIV-1 Tat would impair cognitive behavior and
injure specific hippocampal interneuron subtypes. Male transgenic mice that
inducibly expressed HIV-1 Tat (or non-expressing controls) were assessed for
cognitive behavior or had hippocampal CA1 subregions evaluated via interneuron
subpopulation markers. Tat exposure decreased spatial memory in a Barnes maze and
mnemonic performance in a novel object recognition test. Tat reduced the
percentage of neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) without
neuropeptide Y immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale and the stratum
radiatum, parvalbumin in the stratum pyramidale, and somatostatin in the stratum 
oriens, which are consistent with reductions in interneuron-specific interneuron 
type 3 (IS3), bistratified, and oriens-lacunosum-moleculare interneurons,
respectively. The findings reveal that an interconnected ensemble of CA1
nNOS-expressing interneurons, the IS3 cells, as well as subpopulations of
parvalbumin- and somatostatin-expressing interneurons are preferentially
vulnerable to HIV-1 Tat. Importantly, the susceptible interneurons form a
microcircuit thought to be involved in feedback inhibition of CA1 pyramidal cells
and gating of CA1 pyramidal cell inputs. The identification of vulnerable CA1
hippocampal interneurons may provide novel insight into the basic mechanisms
underlying key functional and neurobehavioral deficits associated with HAND.
