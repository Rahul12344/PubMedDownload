To estimate the relationship between genomic change in the E2/NS1 region and
clinical feature, we made a pairwise comparison in the nucleotide and deduced
amino acid sequences for multiple recombinant clones of the E2/NS1 region, which 
derived from blood samples taken from four patients (three treated by IFN) at
different stages. Sequence heterogeneities among the clones were generally high
but they appeared to be significantly lowered after cessation of therapy. Our
results showed, through IFN therapy, a few clones were selected and survived,
although many clones disappeared. After discontinuation of the drug, three
patients became carrier state, normal ALT levels with viremia. Evolution of
defective viruses was seen in most of the cases. These features of HCV genome
suggest that the virus could circulate as an extremely heterogeneous population
including defective virus, and that this heterogeneity lend itself to selection
pressures including interferon therapy and host immune response.
