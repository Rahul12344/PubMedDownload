Natural products are described which have shown activity against human
immunodeficiency virus in vitro. These compounds have a variety of chemical
structures and modes of action. The discovery of these compounds and features of 
their development are used to illustrate aspects of the wider use of natural
products as novel pharmaceutical agents. Several compounds detailed are being
tested clinically and may provide new leads for viral chemotherapy. The use of
extracts with isolated constituents is also discussed.
