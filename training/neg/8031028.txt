We compared the in vitro efficacies of two-, three-, and four-drug combinations
given continuously or in alternating regimens against a clinical isolate of human
immunodeficiency virus type 1. In H9 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, at the drug concentrations used in this study, there was greater
suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection as the number of
drugs in the regimen was increased from one to four simultaneously administered
agents. Although alternating drug regimens were effective, they were not better
than continuous administration of either single drugs or combinations of agents
and were less effective than giving all drugs of an alternating regimen
simultaneously.
