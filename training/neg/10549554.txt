Reducing phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in transgenic tobacco compromises systemic 
acquired resistance (SAR) to tobacco mosaic virus, while increasing
phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enhances SAR. Surprisingly, transgenic tobacco
plants compromised in SAR exhibit more effective grazing-induced systemic
resistance to larvae of Heliothis virescens, whereas induced insect resistance is
compromised in transgenic plants with elevated phenylpropanoid levels. Levels of 
the phenylpropanoid-derived signal salicylic acid are directly correlated with
overall phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in this series of transgenic plants.
Moreover, while pathogen-induced SAR is almost completely compromised in
salicylic acid-deficient plants expressing the bacterial nahG salicylate
hydroxylase gene, these plants show enhanced grazing-induced insect resistance
compared to wild-type. Hence, suppression of grazing-induced insect resistance is
mediated at least in part by salicylic acid and likely reflects salicylic acid
inhibition of the synthesis and action of the wound signal jasmonic acid. We
propose that the dual functions of salicylic acid contribute to a signal poise
which constrains constitutive expression of disease and insect resistance
mechanisms, and reciprocally switches their selective activation.
