A 79-year-old woman with a history of pyothorax was admitted with a 4-day history
of abdominal distension. Physical examination revealed marked abdominal
distention, absent bowel sounds, and a vesicular rash over the left Th8-10
dermatome. Abdominal radiography showed gaseous distension of the colon and
ileum. Colonoscopy excluded any obstructive process of the colon. Laboratory
findings yielded positive results for serum IgM and IgG against the varicella
zoster virus (VZV) . Paralytic ileus associated with the VZV was therefore
diagnosed. The ileus improved after conservative treatment with intravenous
acyclovir. Although shingles is frequently encountered, it is a rare cause of
paralytic ileus. In the future, the VZV should be considered as one of the causes
of paralytic ileus, and complete resolution can be achieved with conservative
management.
