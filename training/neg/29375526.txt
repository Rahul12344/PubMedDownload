Ebola virus (EBOV) causes severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans, and no approved
therapeutics or vaccine is currently available. Glycoprotein (GP) is the major
protective antigen of EBOV, and can generate virus-like particles (VLPs) by
co-expression with matrix protein (VP40). In this study, we constructed a
recombinant Alphavirus Semliki Forest virus (SFV) replicon vector DREP to express
EBOV GP and matrix viral protein (VP40). EBOV VLPs were successfully generated
and achieved budding from 293 cells after co-transfection with DREP-based GP and 
VP40 vectors (DREP-GP+DREP-VP40). Vaccination of BALB/c mice with DREP-GP,
DREP-VP40, or DREP-GP+DREP-VP40 vectors, followed by immediate electroporation
resulted in a mixed IgG subclass production, which recognized EBOV GP and/or VP40
proteins. This vaccination regimen also led to the generation of both Th1 and Th2
cellular immune responses in mice. Notably, vaccination with DREP-GP and
DREP-VP40, which produces both GP and VP40 antigens, induced a significantly
higher level of anti-GP IgG2a antibody and increased IFN-Î³ secreting CD8+ T-cell 
responses relative to vaccination with DREP-GP or DREP-VP40 vector alone. Our
study indicates that co-expression of GP and VP40 antigens based on the SFV
replicon vector generates EBOV VLPs in vitro, and vaccination with recombinant
DREP vectors containing GP and VP40 antigens induces Ebola antigen-specific
humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. This novel approach provides a
simple and efficient vaccine platform for Ebola disease prevention.
