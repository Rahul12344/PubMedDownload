Western blot analysis of 16 serum specimens from Seminole Indians demonstrated
that 14 reacted with the type-specific recombinant epitope (rgp46II+) of human T 
lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II), whereas the remaining 2 specimens did not
(rgp46II-). Both rgp46II- specimens demonstrated presence of HTLV-II genome by
polymerase chain reaction analysis. Culture of 1 of these specimens demonstrated 
presence of type C retrovirus particles by electron microscopy, and p24gag
antigens were detectable in culture supernatant. Nucleotide sequence analysis of 
557 bp in the env gene (position 5405-5961) from 2 each of the rgp46II- and
rgp46II+ specimens demonstrated sequence conservation in the rgp46II epitope
(K-55(162-205)). Thus, lack of immune reactivity to rgp46 is not due to sequence 
variation within this epitope. This observation suggests that immunodominant env 
epitopes may not be universally recognized. Therefore, specimens with p24gag and 
r21eenv reactivity in modified Western blot assays should be further tested by
more sensitive techniques.
