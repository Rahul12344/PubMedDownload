A biotin labelled human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA probe of EcoRI D fragment
(17kb) from HCMV AD 169 strain was prepared. In situ hybridization of HCMV was
performed in paraffin section of tissues collected from an autopsy case of
congenital and combined immunodeficiency syndrome associated with systemic HCMV
and pneumocystis carinii infections. The pathological lesions of HCMV infection
showed three different patterns: 1, necrotic granuloma type, 2, diffuse type, and
3, scattered type. HCMV DNA was identified in all the inclusion bodies and piled 
or granular positive material was found in the nuclei or cytoplasms of some giant
cells. In addition, some morphologically intact cells might be observed positive 
for CMV DNA either in nuclei or in cytoplasms.
