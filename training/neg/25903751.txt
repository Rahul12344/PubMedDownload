OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of cloth masks to
medical masks in hospital healthcare workers (HCWs). The null hypothesis is that 
there is no difference between medical masks and cloth masks.
SETTING: 14 secondary-level/tertiary-level hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam.
PARTICIPANTS: 1607 hospital HCWs aged ≥18 years working full-time in selected
high-risk wards.
INTERVENTION: Hospital wards were randomised to: medical masks, cloth masks or a 
control group (usual practice, which included mask wearing). Participants used
the mask on every shift for 4 consecutive weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical respiratory illness (CRI), influenza-like illness 
(ILI) and laboratory-confirmed respiratory virus infection.
RESULTS: The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, 
with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm
(relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask 
arm. Cloth masks also had significantly higher rates of ILI compared with the
control arm. An analysis by mask use showed ILI (RR=6.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 28.65)
and laboratory-confirmed virus (RR=1.72, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.94) were significantly 
higher in the cloth masks group compared with the medical masks group.
Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution 
against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform
occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor
filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed 
to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary
measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in
high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.
