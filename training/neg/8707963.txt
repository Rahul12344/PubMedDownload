HIV-1 DNA extracted from frozen and formalin fixed brain tissue can be detected
using PCR. This work has been extended by amplifying, using semiquantitative PCR,
HIV DNA extracted from frontal lobe tissue of 16 patients with AIDS (eight
positive and eight negative for p24 antigen). DNA was amplified using HIV-1 pol
gene digoxigenin labelled primers and detected by chemiluminescence and
densitometry. Cloned standards were amplified in parallel for quantification. HIV
DNA levels detected in frozen tissue showed a correlation with p24 positivity and
the severity of the histological diagnosis. This correlation was less clear in
the formalin fixed material.
