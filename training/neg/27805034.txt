RNA recombination in non-segmented RNA viruses is important for viral evolution
and documented for several virus species through in vitro studies. Here we
confirm viral RNA recombination in vivo using an alphavirus, the SAV3 subtype of 
Salmon pancreas disease virus. The virus causes pancreas disease in Atlantic
salmon and heavy losses in European salmonid aquaculture. Atlantic salmon were
injected with a SAV3 6K-gene deleted cDNA plasmid, encoding a non-viable variant 
of SAV3, together with a helper cDNA plasmid encoding structural proteins and 6K 
only. Later, SAV3-specific RNA was detected and recombination of viral RNA was
confirmed. Virus was grown from plasmid-injected fish and shown to infect and
cause pathology in salmon. Subsequent cloning of PCR products confirming
recombination, documented imprecise homologous recombination creating RNA
deletion variants in fish injected with cDNA plasmid, corresponding with deletion
variants previously found in SAV3 from the field. This is the first experimental 
documentation of alphavirus RNA recombination in an animal model and provides new
insight into the production of defective virus RNA.
