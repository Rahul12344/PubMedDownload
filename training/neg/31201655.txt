Mutations of the CPT2 gene cause CPT2 deficiency and affect the β-oxidation of
fatty acids. This study examined the consequence of a polymorphism of rs1799822
in the CPT2 gene with respect to EV71 encephalitis in Chinese children. The study
included 406 cases of both mild and severe EV71 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR,
together with controls (n = 348). We used an improved multiplex ligation
detection reaction technique to detect the polymorphism of rs1799822 in the CPT2 
gene. The frequency of the (AG+GG) genotype and G allele in the EV71 infection
group and in the severe EV71 encephalitis group was significantly lower than in
the control group (p = 0.012 vs. p = 0.005, and p = 0.022 vs. p = 0.006,
respectively). The frequency of the (AG+GG) genotype and G allele in the severe
EV71 encephalitis group was markedly lower than in the mild EV71 encephalitis
group (p = 0.045, p = 0.033). The ATP levels in the blood of the (AG+GG) genotype
were distinctly higher than in the AA genotype in mild and severe EV71
encephalitis patients (P = 0.037, P = 0.040). A polymorphism of rs1799822 in the 
CPT2 gene is associated with the severity of EV71 encephalitis and may be one of 
the protection factors of severe EV71 encephalitis.
