The Rev protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) facilitates the nuclear
export of intron containing viral mRNAs allowing formation of infectious virions.
Rev traffics through the nucleolus and shuttles between the nucleus and
cytoplasm. Rev multimerization and interaction with the export protein CRM1 takes
place in the nucleolus. To test the importance of Rev nucleolar trafficking in
the HIV-1 replication cycle, we created a nucleolar localizing Rev Response
Element (RRE) decoy and tested this for its anti-HIV activity. The RRE decoy
provided marked inhibition of HIV-1 replication in both the CEM T-cell line and
in primary CD34+ derived monocytes. These results demonstrate that titration of
Rev in the nucleolus impairs HIV-1 replication and supports a functional role for
Rev trafficking in this sub-cellular compartment.
