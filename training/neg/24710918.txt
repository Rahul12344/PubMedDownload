BACKGROUND: Pill burden, dosing frequency, and concerns about safety and
tolerability are important obstacles to maintaining adequate medication
adherence. Raltegravir (RAL) is indicated for twice-daily dosing and when taken
with emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), it becomes a
twice-daily multiple-tablet regimen. Elvitegravir (EVG)/cobicistat
(COBI)/FTC/TDF, STB, is the first approved once-a-day integrase strand transfer
inhibitor (INSTI) containing single-tablet regimen that combines EVG, an INSTI,
and COBI, a novel pharmacoenhancer, with the preferred nucleos(t)ide backbone of 
FTC/TDF.
METHODS: This was a 48-week prospective, single-arm open-label study of the
switch to STB in virologically sup-pressed HIV-1-infected adult patients on
FTC/TDF and twice-daily RAL for at least 6 months. Objectives were to evaluate
the tolerability and safety of a regimen simplification to once-a-day STB, while 
maintaining viral suppression through 48 weeks.
RESULTS: Forty-eight individuals in the United States were enrolled. The median
age was 44 years, 96% were male, and 83% were White. The median time on RAL +
FTC/TDF treatment prior to enrollment was 34 months. Ninety-six percent of
participants cited regimen simplification as the reason to enroll in the switch
study. At base-line, the median CD4 count was 714 cell/ÂµL and estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 105 mL/min. At week 48, all assessed study 
participants remained viro-logically suppressed to the lower limit of
quantification (HIV-1 RNA<50 copies/mL) and maintained high CD4 cell count
(median, 751 cells/mL) and stable eGFR (median, 100.5 mL/min). STB was well
tolerated with no discontinuations, no study drug-related serious adverse events,
and no study drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: All participants switching to 1 tablet once-a-day STB from a
twice-daily RAL + FTC/TDF regimen remained virologically suppressed. STB was well
tolerated. Switching to STB may be a viable option for virologically suppressed
patients wanting to simplify from a twice-daily RAL-containing regimen.
