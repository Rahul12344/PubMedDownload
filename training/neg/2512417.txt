The production of interferon-alpha/beta (INF-alpha/beta) and interferon gamma
(IFN-gamma) in NOD and ICR mice was studied in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro
IFN-alpha/beta production in the spleen cells of NOD mice, which were stimulated 
with either Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus, poly(I:C) or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was very similar to the IFN-alpha/beta production in
the spleen cells of ICR mice. Contrastingly, the in vitro IFN-gamma production in
the spleen cells of NOD mice, which were stimulated with either concanavalin A
(Con A), phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or pokeweed mitogen (PWM), was greater than the
IFN-gamma production in spleen cells of ICR mice. The in vivo IFN-alpha/beta
production in NOD mice induced by NDV was also very similar to that in ICR mice, 
whereas the in vivo IFN-gamma production in the BCG-sensitized NOD mice, which
was induced by purified protein derivative (PPD), was greater than that in the
ICR mice. These results may indicate that NOD mice have abnormalities on the
IFN-gamma production.
