The replication protein (Rep) gene of Tobacco curly shoot virus (TbCSV) Y35
isolate was obtained from the infected tobacco plants by PCR and cloned into
expression vector pGEX-4T-1 to generate the recombinant plasmid pGEX-Y35Rep. The 
recombinant plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) pLys S,
and TbCSV Rep fusion protein was expressed with induction by IPTG and some
products were soluble. The Rep fusion protein was purified with GST-Sepharose 4B 
affinity chromatography and its polyclonal antibody was produced in a rabbit.
Studies on subcellular distribution of TbCSV Rep protein in infected tobacco
leaves revealed that Rep protein mainly exists in the fractions containing the
nucleus. Immuno-gold labeling with the antibody against Rep fusion protein also
indicated that Rep protein localized in the nuclei of infected tobacco cells.
