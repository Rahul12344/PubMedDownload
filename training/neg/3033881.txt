Anti-BK-virus hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies were revealed in 81.8% of
the patients with parotid gland tumors. Results of the investigations conducted
on oromaxillofacial tumors including the parotid gland ones are discussed from
the point of view of the presence of viral antigens (herpes-, SV40 and
BK-viruses) and of specific antibodies. Possible implication of the papova
viruses in the etiopathogenesis of the parotid gland tumors in humans are also
discussed.
