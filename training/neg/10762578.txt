The epidemiology of herpesvirus papio, a lymphocryptovirus similar to
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was studied in a captive colony of >1900 baboons.
Herpesvirus papio IgG antibody titers were measured by IFA. In total, 438
specimens from 296 baboons were assessed, including 116 serial specimens from 52 
juveniles and 6 infants studied monthly for 1 year following birth and at age 18 
months. Maternally derived antibody reached a nadir at 4 months of age. About 75%
of animals at 12 months of age and >95% of animals after age 24 months
demonstrated serologic evidence of herpesvirus papio infection. After age 3
years, the geometric mean titer was 1:60-75. The epidemiology of herpesvirus
papio infection in baboons closely parallels that of EBV infection in humans. An 
animal model of lymphocryptovirus infection will facilitate investigations of
human lymphocryptovirus biology.
