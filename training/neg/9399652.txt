The present investigation was carried out to estimate the prevalence of
EBV-associated cases among gastric carcinoma (GC) patients of Russia and the
Republics of the former Soviet Union (FSU). With this aim, formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded blocks from 206 gastric carcinomas obtained from patients of
the Cancer Research Center, Moscow, were investigated by EBV-encoded RNA-1
(EBER-1) in situ hybridization applied to paraffin sections. As a result, 18 GC
cases (8.7%) revealed uniform EBER-1 expression restricted to the carcinoma
cells. Hybridized signals not detected in non-neoplastic gastric epithelium. EBV 
involvement was significantly more frequent among males, especially in tumors of 
less differentiated types (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinomas and 
poorly differentiated solid adenocarcinomas) and located in the upper stomach
(cardia and middle). Most EBV-positive GCs were characterized by strong
lymphoid-compartment involvement. Our findings concerning the distribution of
EBV-positive GCs by sex, site and hystological type are similar to those in
Japan, however, EBV-positive rate of GC cases in Russia is higher than in Japan
and lower than in USA.
