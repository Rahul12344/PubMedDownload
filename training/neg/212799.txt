The experimental infection of piglets with a porcine reovirus.

Elazhary MA, Morin M, Derbyshire JB, Lagac√© A, Berthiaume L, Corbeil M.

A strain (Quebec) of reovirus isolated from the faeces of a pig with dysentery
was neutralised by reovirus type 1 antiserum. Four of eight
hysterectomy-produced, colostrum-deprived (HPCD) piglets dosed orally with the
third cell culture passage of the virus developed diarrhoea and showed focal
areas of villous atrophy in the small intestine. The virus was isolated from the 
intestinal tract of all eight specific pathogen free piglets, but not from three 
control animals. Nine germ-free piglets dosed orally with the eight cell culture 
passage of the virus showed neither clinical signs nor lesions, but virus was
recovered from their intestinal tracts for 14 days after infection. No virus was 
isolated from four control germ-free piglets.
