Immunosuppressive therapy and virus-cores in HBAg-positive chronic hepatitis.

Kendrey G, Szalka A, László B, Binder L, Hollós I.

Three liver biopsies were carried out in a case of chronic active hepatitis with 
persistent HB-antigenemia. Virus-cores could not be detected in the liver cell
nuclei by electron microscopy before immunosuppressive therapy. Intranuclear,
ring-shaped virus-cores of 20-25 nm diameter appeared in almost every hepatocyte 
examined during immunosuppression.
