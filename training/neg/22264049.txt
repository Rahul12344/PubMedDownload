There have been encouraging recent successes in the development of safe and
effective topical microbicides to prevent vaginal or rectal HIV-1 transmission,
based on the use of anti-retroviral drugs. However, much work remains to be
accomplished before a microbicide becomes a standard element of prevention
science strategies. Animal models should continue to play an important role in
pre-clinical testing, with emphasis on safety, pharmacokinetic and efficacy
testing.
