A case of severe drug-induced liver injury caused by over the counter (OTC) herb 
medicine, is reported here. A 40-year-old male took herb drugs "Za ga-doKowa速,"
"Ohta-Isan速." These two drugs contained the same two herb medicines (cinnamon,
fennel). About 4 months later after taking medicine, jaundice appeared.
Prothrombin time activation (PT) was 45%, aspartate transaminase (AST) was 1104
IU/l, and total bilirubin (T-bil) 14.7 mg/dL. Serum tests for hepatitis viruses
(A, B, C, E) were negative. Lymphocyte stimulating test was positive for Za ga-do
Kowa 速 and Ohta-I Isan速. Liver 3D constructed by construct-CT revealed findings
of the potato-like liver. The liver biopsy specimen revealed multilobular hepatic
necrosis accompanied by scar formation, severe zonal degeneration and necrosis of
hepatocytes mainly in the central area of the lobule. In the reported 13 cases of
cinnamon-induced liver diseases, there has been a severe abnormality of PT and
T-bil. Biopsy findings of these cases showed wide ranges of necrosis. Liver
injury due to cinnamon shows very severe damages, and the possibility of liver
failure due to cinnamon may be imminent. How to cite this article: Higaki H, Onji
