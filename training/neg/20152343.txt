AIM: The aim of the study was to assess the impact of human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) exposure on survival and extent of disease in necrotizing
enterocolitis (NEC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with NEC requiring surgery between June 1998
and June 2008 were analyzed. Three groups were identified: those born to
HIV-positive (HIV+) mothers, those born to HIV-negative (HIV-) mothers, and those
with an unknown HIV status. Primary outcome measure was survival to discharge.
Secondary outcome measure was extent of disease.
RESULTS: One hundred nine infants (mean gestational age, 31 weeks; birth weight, 
1413 g) underwent surgery for NEC. Gestational age, birth weight, and day of
presentation were similar in all 3 groups, showing no statistical difference. The
HIV+ group consisted of 22 infants, of which 13 (59%) died and 2 (9%) had
panintestinal necrosis. The HIV- group consisted of 48 infants, of which 11 (23%)
died, with 3(6%) having panintestinal necrosis. The remaining group of HIV
(unknown) consisted of 38 infants, of which 14 (37%) died, with 2 (5%) having
panintestinal necrosis. The latter group was not included in the analysis; but
comparing the HIV+ and HIV- groups, there was a statistically higher chance of
death (odds ratio = 4.8, P = .05). There was no difference statistically in the
extent of disease.
CONCLUSION: Neonates with NEC born to HIV+ mothers have a higher mortality.
