Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission has decreased with the adoption of universal
blood donor screening and social policies to reduce the risk of infection in
intravenous drug users, but remains a worldwide health problem. The objective of 
this study was to evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among sequences from
different HCV genomic regions from sexual partners of infected patients. Nine
couples with a stable relationship and without other risk factors for HCV
infection and 42 control patients were selected, and the NS3 and NS5B regions
were analysed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that viruses from five of the couples
had a common origin, clustering in the same monophyletic group, with bootstrap
values greater than 70. For the other couples, monophyletic groups were observed,
but without bootstrap support. Thus, using two different viral genome regions, a 
common source of infection was observed in both members of five couples. These
data strongly support HCV transmission within couples.
