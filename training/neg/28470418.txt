Feline morbillivirus (FeMV), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, is an
emerging virus that was discovered in 2012. Despite the importance of FeMV
infection in cats because of its postulated involvement in kidney diseases, no
simple serological assay has been reported in its detection. Here, FeMV
phosphoprotein (P protein) was expressed and purified as a
glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fusion protein and used for an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect FeMV-specific antibodies. With a cutoff
value determined by immunoblotting, anti-FeMV P protein was detected with this
assay in 22 (22%) of the 100 cat plasma samples collected from various regions of
Japan. This ELISA is useful for epidemiological and immunological studies, as
well as for diagnosis of FeMV infection.
