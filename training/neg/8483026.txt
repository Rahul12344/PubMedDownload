We reviewed the course of 545 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected
patients seen between 1983 and March 30, 1991. A majority were Caucasian
homosexual or bisexual men, while parenteral drug abusers represented a smaller
proportion than seen nationwide. In the 274 patients with the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the distribution of AIDS-defining conditions
was generally consistent with those reported in studies from elsewhere in the
United States. However, toxoplasmosis remained relatively uncommon. There was a
slightly higher incidence of disseminated histoplasmosis compared to other
studies. HIV encephalopathy (AIDS dementia) was likely underdiagnosed. Although
data suggested prolongation of the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection, median
survival after AIDS diagnosis remained approximately 12 months.
