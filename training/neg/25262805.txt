HIV infection/AIDS, is a fatal disease multiplying rapidly in virtually every
country. Extensive creations are in progress to arrest the replication of the
HIV, following the destruction of either particular step involved in the
progression of HIV infection. In such endeavors, mechanistically more diverse
antiviral therapies were showcased using naturally occurring triterpene acid and 
their derivatives acting at various stages of HIV life cycle like entry or
fusion, function of HIV protease enzyme and finally at maturation. The present
article holds an extensive step-by-step summary of anti-HIV breakthroughs of
triterpene acid analogues and their derivatives with synthetic and activity
aspects, featuring fertile clues for novel anti-HIV drug design, which helps to
develop unprecedented opportunities to discover the next-generation anti- HIV
armamentarium.
