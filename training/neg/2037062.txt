A recombinant baculovirus, vAc alpha hCG, having a replacement of the viral
polyhedrin gene with the cDNA encoding the alpha subunit of hCG was used to
express alpha hCG, an extensively glycosylated hormone, in insect cells.
Virus-infected cells, 72 h pi, secreted approximately 11.3 micrograms alpha hCG/2
x 10(6) cells/ml which was identical to the native hormonal peptide in terms of
electrophoretic mobility, immunoreactivity and bioactivity on association with
beta subunit, as evident by its binding to rat testicular cells and induction of 
steroidogenesis in a mouse Leydig cell bioassay system. The alpha hCG secreted
into the medium represented approximately 20-30% of the total hCG synthesized by 
vAc alpha CG infected insect cells. The implications of using a very late
promoter, in a baculovirus expression system, for directing the transcription of 
a gene whose gene product requires extensive post-translational modifications are
discussed.
