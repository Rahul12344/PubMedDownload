A 2-month-old, former 28-week premature infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia
infected with respiratory syncytial virus was treated with nitric oxide and high 
frequency oscillatory ventilation after conventional therapy failed. Nitric oxide
and high frequency oscillatory ventilation rapidly improved oxygenation allowing 
recovery without the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. This treatment
regimen should be considered as an option in high-risk infants with respiratory
syncytial virus infection who meet extracorporeal membrane oxygenation criteria.
