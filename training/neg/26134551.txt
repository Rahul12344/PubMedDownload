Our study describes the discovery of a series of highly potent hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) NS5A inhibitors based on symmetrical prolinamide derivatives of benzidine
and diaminofluorene. Through modification of benzidine, l-proline, and
diaminofluorene derivatives, we developed novel inhibitor structures, which
allowed us to establish a library of potent HCV NS5A inhibitors. After optimizing
the benzidine prolinamide backbone, we identified inhibitors embedding
meta-substituted benzidine core structures that exhibited the most potent
anti-HCV activities. Furthermore, through a battery of studies including hERG
ligand binding assay, CYP450 binding assay, rat plasma stability test, human
liver microsomal stability test, and pharmacokinetic studies, the identified
compounds 24, 26, 27, 42, and 43 are found to be nontoxic, and are expected to be
effective therapeutic anti-HCV agents.
