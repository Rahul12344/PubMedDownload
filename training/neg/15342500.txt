CarD is the only reported prokaryotic protein showing structural and functional
features typical of eukaryotic high-mobility group A transcription factors. In
prokaryotes, proteins similar to CarD appear to be confined primarily to
myxobacteria. In Myxococcus xanthus, CarD has been previously shown to act as a
positive element in two different regulatory networks: one for light-induced
synthesis of carotenoids and the other for starvation-induced fruiting body
formation. We have now tested the effect of a loss-of-function mutation in the
carD gene (carD1) on the expression of a random collection of lacZ-tagged genes, 
which are normally expressed in the dark during vegetative growth in rich medium.
Our results indicate that CarD plays a significant role in the transcriptional
regulation of various indicated genes. The carD1 mutation downregulates some
genes and upregulates others. Also reported here is the isolation of several
mutations that suppress the strong effect of carD1 on the expression of a
particular vegetative gene. One of them (sud-2) also suppresses the effect of
carD1 on other vegetative genes and on fruiting-body formation. Thus, CarD and
the sud-2 gene product appear to participate in a single mechanism, which
underlies various apparently diverse regulatory phenomena ascribed to CarD.
