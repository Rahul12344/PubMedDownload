INTRODUCTION: Acute Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection is associated with a
range of neurological conditions. Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare presentation;
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is the commonest form of
Guillain-Barré syndrome. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy has
occasionally been reported in acute Immunodeficiency Virus infection but little
data exists on frequency, management and outcome.
CASE PRESENTATION: We describe an episode of Guillain-Barré syndrome presenting
as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in a 30-year-old man testing
positive for Immunodeficiency Virus, probably during acute seroconversion.
Clinical suspicion was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid analysis and nerve
conduction studies. Rapid clinical deterioration prompted intravenous
immunoglobulin therapy and early commencement of highly active anti-retroviral
therapy. All symptoms resolved within nine weeks.
CONCLUSION: Unusual neurological presentations in previously fit patients are an 
appropriate indication for Immunodeficiency-Virus testing. Highly active
anti-retroviral therapy with adequate penetration of the central nervous system
should be considered as an early intervention, alongside conventional therapies
such as intravenous immunoglobulin.
