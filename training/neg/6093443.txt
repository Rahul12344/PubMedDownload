Simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen was partially purified from small amounts 
of SV40-infected and SV40-transformed cells by immunoaffinity chromatography with
high recovery. T antigen, in both crude and partially purified states, was
detected rapidly by a sensitive and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA). Stability of the partially purified T antigen was found to
increase by addition of 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA).
