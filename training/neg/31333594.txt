The human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B has probably been
circulating on the island of Hispaniola since the 1960s, but information about
the early viral history on this Caribbean island is scarce. In this study, we
reconstruct the dissemination dynamics of early divergent non-pandemic subtype B 
lineages (designated BCAR) on Hispaniola by analyzing a country-balanced dataset 
of HIV-1 BCAR pol sequences from Haiti (n = 103) and the Dominican Republic (n = 
123). Phylogenetic analyses supported that BCAR strains from Haiti and the
Dominican Republic were highly intermixed between each other, although the null
hypothesis of completely random mixing was rejected. Bayesian phylogeographic
analyses placed the ancestral BCAR virus in Haiti and the Dominican Republic with
the same posterior probability support. These analyses estimate frequent viral
transmissions between Haiti and the Dominican Republic since the early 1970s
onwards, and the presence of local BCAR transmission networks in both countries
before first AIDS cases was officially recognized. Demographic reconstructions
point that the BCAR epidemic in Hispaniola grew exponentially until the 1990s.
These findings support that the HIV-1 epidemics in Haiti and the Dominican
Republic have been connected by a recurrent bidirectional viral flux since the
initial phase, which poses a great challenge in tracing the geographic origin of 
the BCAR epidemic within Hispaniola using only genetic data. These data also
reinforce the notion that prevention programs have successfully reduced the rate 
of new HIV-1 transmissions in Hispaniola since the end of the 1990s.
