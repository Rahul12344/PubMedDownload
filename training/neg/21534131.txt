Indonesia has one of the fastest growing, injecting drugs user-driven, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemics in Asia. Coverage of needle and syringe
programs (NSPs), opioid substitution therapy (OST), and antiretroviral treatment 
(ART) is increasing, but is still low, whereas professional training in addiction
medicine is not yet established. Urgent development and scaling-up of
professional capacity in comprehensive, evidence-based addiction medicine is
needed. In this article the results of the first step is presented, being the
training needs assessment (TNA) and the process of further developing a national 
evidence- and competence-based addiction medicine curriculum in Indonesia.
