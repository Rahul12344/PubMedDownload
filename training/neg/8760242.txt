The adult mammalian kidney tubule epithelium exists in a relatively dormant,
slowly replicative state but has a large potential for regenerative morphogenesis
following severe ischemic or toxic injury. Under selective serum-free growth
conditions, which included epidermal growth factor and retinoic acid, a
subpopulation of renal proximal tubule cells isolated from adult rabbit kidney
were grown in cell culture. These cells possessed two important characteristics: 
1) an ability to differentiate morphogenically into tubule structures when grown 
in three-dimensional collagen gels and 2) a high capacity for self-renewal, since
cell lineage analysis with a recombinant retrovirus demonstrated that in vitro
tubulogenesis arose from clonal expansion of a single cell. Thus individual cells
in the adult kidney have retained the ability for kidney tubulogenesis in vitro.
