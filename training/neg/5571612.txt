Requirement of protein synthesis for bacteriophage phi X174 superinfection
exclusion.

Hutchison CA 3rd, Sinsheimer RL.

Within 5 to 10 min at 37 C, bacteria infected by bacteriophage phiX174 acquire
the ability to exclude superinfecting phiX particles from reproducing themselves.
The superinfecting phage are blocked at a stage prior to synthesis of the
parental replicative form molecule; the superinfecting deoxyribonucleic acid
remains as intact (infective) single strands. Establishment of superinfection
exclusion and its maintenance require protein synthesis.
