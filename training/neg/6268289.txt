Chromosomes and cell surface markers of marmoset lymphocytes and Epstein-Barr
virus-transformed marmoset cell lines.

Johnson DR, Levan G, Klein G, Nigida SM Jr, Wolfe LG.

The G-banded karyotypes of both normal lymphocytes and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-transformed lymphocytes of cotton-topped marmosets (Saguinus oedipus) were 
examined. The marmoset lymphocytes and EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cells had
normal diploid chromosomes (2n = 46) with no specific cytogenic change associated
with transformation in vitro. EBV-transformed marmoset lymphocytes expressed the 
cell surface markers of B lymphocytes and EB viral antigens.
