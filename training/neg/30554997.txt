Comment in
    Lancet Infect Dis. 2019 Mar;19(3):e63.

As the leading infectious cause of death worldwide and the primary proximal cause
of death in individuals living with HIV, tuberculosis remains a global concern.
Existing tuberculosis control strategies that rely on passive case-finding appear
insufficient to achieve targets for reductions in tuberculosis incidence and
mortality. Active case-finding strategies aim to detect infectious individuals
earlier in their infectious period to reduce onward transmission and improve
treatment outcomes. Empirical studies of active case-finding have produced mixed 
results and determining how to direct active screening to those most at risk
remains a topic of intense research. Our systematic review of literature
evaluating the effects of geographically targeted tuberculosis screening
interventions found three studies in low tuberculosis incidence settings, but
none conducted in high tuberculosis incidence countries. We discuss open
questions related to the use of spatially targeted approaches for active
screening in countries where tuberculosis incidence is highest.
