BACKGROUND: Dose-response parameters based on clinical challenges are frequently 
used to assess the health impact of protozoa in drinking water. We compare the
risk estimates associated with Giardia in drinking water derived from the
dose-response parameter published in the literature and the incidence of acute
digestive conditions (ADC) measured in the framework of an epidemiological study 
in a general population.
METHODS: The study combined a daily follow-up of digestive morbidity among a
panel of 544 volunteers and a microbiological surveillance of tap water. The
relationship between incidence of ADC and concentrations of Giardia cysts was
modeled with Generalized Estimating Equations, adjusting on community, age, tap
water intake, presence of bacterial indicators, and genetic markers of viruses.
The quantitative estimate of Giardia dose was the product of the declared amount 
of drinking water intake (in L) by the logarithm of cysts concentrations.
RESULTS: The Odds Ratio for one unit of dose [OR = 1.76 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.55)]
showed a very good consistency with the risk assessment estimate computed after
the literature dose-response, provided application of a 20 % abatement factor to 
the cysts counts that were measured in the epidemiological study. Doing so, a
daily water intake of 2 L and a Giardia concentration of 10 cysts/100 L, would
yield an estimated relative excess risk of 12 % according to the Rendtorff model,
against 11 % when multiplying the baseline rate of ADC by the corresponding OR.
This abatement parameter encompasses uncertainties associated with germ
viability, infectivity and virulence in natural settings.
CONCLUSION: The dose-response function for waterborne Giardia risk derived from
clinical experiments is consistent with epidemiological data. However, much
remains to be learned about key characteristics that may heavily influence
quantitative risk assessment results.
