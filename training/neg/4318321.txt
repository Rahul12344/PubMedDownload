Surveillance of acute respiratory virus infections in general practice.

Martin KW, Blair W, Brown WK, Clarke A, McAlister AM.

The ordinary postal system provides a simple method for the transportation of
specimens for virus isolation to the laboratory. This was used to carry out an
epidemiological survey, in general practice, of respiratory viruses in patients
with acute respiratory disease. Three distinct outbreaks of myxovirus infections 
were recognized and most other types of respiratory viruses were isolated
sporadically. After the initial "pilot" phase of the study an isolation rate of
24% was obtained over the months from October 1968 to June 1969 (20% isolations
from adults' specimens and 29% from those of children).
