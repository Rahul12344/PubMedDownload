Rotaviral associated disease of infants in the UK is seasonal and infection in
adults not uncommon but the relationship between these has been little explored. 
Adult sera collected monthly for one year from routine hospital samples were
screened for the presence of anti-group A rotavirus immunoglobulin M class
antibodies as a marker of recent infection. Anti-rotavirus IgM was seen in all
age groups throughout the year with little obvious seasonal variation in the
distribution of antibody levels. IgM concentrations and the proportion
seropositive above a threshold both increased with age with high concentrations
consistently observed in the elderly. Results suggest either high infection rates
of rotavirus in adults, irrespective of seasonal disease incidence in infants,
IgM persistence or IgM cross-reactivity. These results support recent evidence of
differences between infant and adult rotavirus epidemiology and highlight the
need for more extensive surveys to investigate age and time related infection and
transmission of rotavirus.
