The prevalence of serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus infection in various
populations in Greece was examined to provide data for formulating cost-effective
strategies for prevaccination screening. Markers were detected in 17.5% of 320
healthy persons, 73.3% of 273 multiply transfused patients and 61.0% of 146
haemodialysis patients. In multiply transfused patients, antibody to hepatitis B 
surface antigen (anti-HBs) was significantly more common than antibody to core
antigen (anti-HBc) (67.0%, 44.3%), while the opposite was true for haemodialysis 
patients (43.8%, 57.5%). These data suggest that it may be most cost-effective to
screen only for anti-HBs in multiply transfused patients and only anti-HBc in
haemodialysis patients. Vaccination without screening may be more cost-effective 
for healthy persons. Anti-HBs and anti-HBc were detected with similar frequencies
(14.7%, 15.9%), thus neither offers an advantage in screening healthy persons,
although use of anti-HBc may facilitate detection of chronic carriers. These data
indicate that the choice of marker for pre-vaccination screening should depend on
the population under consideration.
