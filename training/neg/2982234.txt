Base mutations in the terminal noncoding regions of the genome of vesicular
stomatitis virus isolated from persistent infections of L cells.

Wilusz J, Youngner JS, Keene JD.

The 3'-terminal regions of the genomes of vesicular stomatitis virus obtained
from two long-term, independently initiated persistent infections of L cells were
found to contain several sequence mutations. In contrast to the hypermutability
displayed in the 5'-terminal regions of the genomes of viruses obtained from
persistent infections of baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (P. J. O'Hara, F. M.
Horodyski, S. T. Nichol, and J. J. Holland, J. Virol. 49, 793-798, 1984), no 5'
mutations were detected in viruses from L-cell carrier lines. The absence of
detectable defective interfering (DI) particles in the L-cell carrier cultures
may account for this difference. Plus-strand leader RNA made by the viruses from 
persistently infected L cells failed to accumulate from 5 to 8 hr postinfection
unlike the accumulation noted for the leader RNA generated by wild-type VSV.
Minus-strand leader RNA, on the other hand, accumulated at a similar or increased
rate compared to wild type. The relationship of these observations to the
processes of host shutoff, viral transcription, and replication are discussed.
