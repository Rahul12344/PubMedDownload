OBJECTIVE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an established risk
factor for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, antiviral treatment resistance, and 
progression of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection to fibrosis.
Apolipoprotein-B 100 (ApoB-100) is a dyslipidemia marker and steatosis predictor.
We assess the correlation between ApoB-100 and hepatosteatosis.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 1,218 HCV-seropositive participants 
from a 2012-2013 health checkup in Taiwan. NAFLD was detected using ultrasound.
All anthropometric and laboratory studies that included ApoB-100 were evaluated
whether or not ApoB-100 predicts NAFLD. Logistic regression was also used to
examine the association between ApoB-100 and NAFLD.
RESULTS: Participants were 47.16 ± 16.08 years old (mean age). The overall
prevalence of NAFLD was 35.8% (n = 436; 32.8% men, 38.1% women). Participants
with ApoB-100 ≥ 8 had a significantly higher incidence of NAFLD (39.4 vs. 29.4%; 
95% CI 0.044-0.156; p < 0.001). After confounding factors had been adjusted for, 
ApoB-100 was significantly associated with NAFLD (OR 5.45; 95% CI 1.64-18.06; p =
0.006) and high-grade hepatosteatosis (OR 7.73; 95% CI 1.74-34.35; p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: ApoB-100 is strongly associated with NAFLD in people with
non-genotype 3 HCV; greater ApoB-100 content is significantly correlated with
higher-grade hepatosteatosis.
