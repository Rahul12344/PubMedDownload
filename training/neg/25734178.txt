Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
promises tremendous benefits, but high cost may impede implementation of this
regimen. Subgroups with excellent response to 8 weeks of treatment might respond 
to a shorter course. In ION-3, 423 previously untreated HCV genotype 1-infected
patients without cirrhosis had outcome data after receiving ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
for 8 weeks. After reanalyzing published ION-3 data, we found that sustained
virologic response (SVR) rates varied significantly by gender (P = .002) and
rs12979860 genotype (P trend = .03), exceeding 98% in women and rs12979860-CC
individuals. The very high SVR rates in these subgroups suggest that these
factors might be considered in selecting patients to receive 8 weeks of
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and support shorter trials of this regimen in selected
patients.
