tumor immunity].

[Article in German]

Hunsmann G.

Five main structural polypeptides of Friend murine leukemia virus, a typical
C-type RNA tumor virus, have been isolated. Their localization within the
particle was attempted. They range from 10,000-71,000 in molecular weight and
display three kinds of immunological determinants. The major envelope
glycoprotein binds to cellular receptors and elicits the formation of antibodies 
which neutralize the virus and kill virus producing tumor cells in vitro. Natural
as well as artificial immunity to this component protects mice against virus
induced leukemia.
