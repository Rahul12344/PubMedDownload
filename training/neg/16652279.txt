To differentiate between the effects that antiretroviral drugs have on the
endothelium and the secondary effects that they have on immune function, viral
load, and dyslipidemia, 6 non-human immunodeficiency virus-infected human
subjects were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir for 1 month and, on the basis of
forearm blood flow, the treatment's effects on endothelial cell function were
measured. Surprisingly, after exposure to lopinavir-ritonavir, absolute forearm
blood-flow responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, acetylcholine,
increased significantly (P=.03), and forearm blood flow decreased to a greater
extent during specific inhibition of NO synthase by N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine.
Thus, in this small cohort of subjects, short-term treatment with
lopinavir-ritonavir does not appear to directly promote endothelial cell
dysfunction.
