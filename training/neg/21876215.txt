HIV clinicians today need to move from focusing on viral suppression to a chronic
disease model in which comorbid conditions and risk factors are comprehensively
identified and addressed to reduce rates of serious non-AIDS-related morbidity
and mortality. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of comorbid
conditions in an Australian HIV-positive population. Of 180 patients included,
there was a median CD4 count of 0.520 cells/mm(3). The majority (88%) of patients
were currently receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). There were
high rates of failure to attend clinical appointments (30%), current smoking
(42%), hypertension (16%), and dyslipidemia (17%). Significant rates of
dipstick-positive proteinuria (16%) and elevated blood glucose (15%) were
recorded. Risk factors were commonly not addressed by the treating clinician.
There is an urgent need to systematize detection and management of
high-prevalence comorbid conditions to prevent premature mortality associated
with serious non-AIDS events.
