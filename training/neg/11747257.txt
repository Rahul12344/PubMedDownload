The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of indicators of
aspiration in previously healthy infants with respiratory syncytial viral (RSV)
bronchiolitis who experienced rapid deterioration in their respiratory status.
Lipid-laden macrophage index (LLMI) was assessed in 6 previously healthy infants 
with RSV bronchiolitis and no prior history of aspiration, who had a rapid
deterioration of their respiratory status requiring mechanical ventilation. Five 
of 6 infants had a LLMI of more than 100, a level that is very suggestive of
aspiration. We conclude that aspiration is likely to play a role when rapid
deterioration occurs in infants with RSV bronchiolitis.
