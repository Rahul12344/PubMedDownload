BACKGROUND/AIMS: Genotype C is the principal type of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in
Koreans and is associated with poor prognosis for peginterferon α-2a therapy. The
efficacy of and compliance to peginterferon α-2a therapy were investigated in
Koreans with hepatitis B in a real clinical setting.
METHODS: Hepatitis B patients treated with peginterferon α-2a from 2008 to 2011
at four university hospitals were consecutively enrolled.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were enrolled; 67 were hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg)-positive. The mean treatment period was 36.1±15.2 weeks. In 26.1% of
patients, treatment was discontinued due to insufficient antiviral effects and
adverse events. At 24 weeks after treatment, 10/42 (23.8%) HBeAg-positive
patients achieved both HBV DNA suppression to <2,000 IU/mL and HBeAg
loss/seroconversion. For HBeAg-negative patients, 10/13 (76.9%) achieved HBV DNA 
suppression to <2,000 IU/mL at 24 weeks after treatment. During the follow-up
period, 15 (30.6%) of the 49 patients who achieved HBV DNA suppression to 2,000
IU/mL developed a breakthrough HBV DNA level of >2×10(6) IU/mL.
CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon α-2a therapy in Koreans with hepatitis B in a real
clinical setting resulted in a lower virologic response, as compared to Western
individuals, but a favorable durability. There is a need to reduce the high rate 
of premature discontinuation compared to the controlled studies.
