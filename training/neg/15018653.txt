BACKGROUND: "Protein-trap" is a method that allows epitope-tagging of endogenous 
proteins. This method allows for the identification of endogenously expressed
proteins that exhibit specific localization of interest. This method has been
recently reported for its application in the study of Drosophila development by
using a relatively large epitope, green-fluorescent-protein (GFP).
RESULT: Herein, we report a new "protein-trap" vector for mammalian cells. This
new method utilizes a much smaller epitope-tag and also allows for drug-selection
prior to the epitope-tagging. Pre-selection by drug resulted in the highly
efficient protein-trapping frequency.
CONCLUSION: The "protein-trap" method based on this new vector is expected to
serve as a complimentary approach to the previously reported GFP-based method.
