The literature on hepatitis B virus (HBV) in immunocompromised patients is
heterogeneous and refers mainly to the pre-antivirals era. Currently, a rational 
approach to the problem of hepatitis B in these patients provides for: a) the
evaluation of HBV markers and of liver condition in all subjects starting
immunosuppressive therapies (baseline), b) the treatment with antivirals
(therapy) of active carriers, c) the pre-emptive use of antivirals (prophylaxis) 
in inactive carriers, especially if they are undergoing immunosuppressive
therapies judged to be at high risk, d) the biochemical and HBsAg monitoring (or 
universal prophylaxis in case of high risk immunosuppression, as in
onco-haematologic patients and bone marrow transplantation) in subjects with
markers of previous contact with HBV (HBsAg-negative and antiHBc-positive), in
order to prevent reverse seroconversion. Moreover in solid organ transplants it
is suggested a strict adherence to the criteria of allocation based on the
virological characteristics of both recipients and donors and the universal
prophylaxis or therapy with nucleos(t)ides analogs.
