Packaging of the eight genomic RNA segments of influenza A viruses (IAV) into
viral particles is coordinated by segment-specific packaging sequences. How the
packaging signals regulate the specific incorporation of each RNA segment into
virions and whether other viral or host factors are involved in this process is
unknown. Here, we show that distinct amino acids of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) 
are required for packaging of specific RNA segments. This was determined by
studying the NP of a bat influenza A-like virus, HL17NL10, in the context of a
conventional IAV (SC35M). Replacement of conserved SC35M NP residues by those of 
HL17NL10 NP resulted in RNA packaging defective IAV. Surprisingly, substitution
of these conserved SC35M amino acids with HL17NL10 NP residues led to IAV with
altered packaging efficiencies for specific subsets of RNA segments. This
suggests that NP harbours an amino acid code that dictates genome packaging into 
infectious virions.
