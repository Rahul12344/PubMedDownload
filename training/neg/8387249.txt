Intranasal vaccination of newborn pigs with pseudorabies virus (PRV) strain Iowa 
S62/26 tk- gX- Bgal+ was evaluated to determine whether protective immunity could
be stimulated in pigs given colostrum from immune sows. Three litters were
vaccinated (2 litters from PRV-immune sows and 1 born to a PRV-free sow), and 2
were left as nonvaccinated controls (1 passively immune and 1 PRV-nonimmune).
Pigs were then challenge-exposed at 15 weeks of age with virulent PRV strain
4892. Vaccinated pigs that suckled nonimmune sows developed serum
PRV-neutralizing antibody by 15 weeks of age and did not die or have reduction in
weight gain or febrile response after challenge exposure. Vaccinated pigs that
suckled PRV-immune sows were seronegative for PRV at the time of challenge
exposure and had less weight loss and fever than did challenge-exposed control
pigs. Intranasal vaccination at birth did not stimulate adequate immunity to
reduce virus shedding after challenge exposure in any of the vaccinated pigs.
