Despite rapidly increasing measles immunization coverage, epidemics of measles
occurred from January to March 2000 in some parts of Accra, the capital of Ghana.
44 cases of acute measles were diagnosed at three health facilities during the
outbreaks, which we examined clinically and serologically. The peak incidence
occurred among 6-12-year-olds, clinical symptoms were milder than the typical
symptoms of measles, and fever was significantly less common. None of the cases
developed complications and all recovered completely. Thirty-eight (86.4%) were
tested serologically; IgM antibodies were detected in 73.7% and IgG antibodies in
84.2% during the acute phase. Milder symptoms in a significant number of cases
with measles IgG antibodies suggest that these are vaccine-modified measles,
attributable to waning antibodies and low circulation of wild type virus in an
area of high vaccine coverage. Serological confirmation will be required for
accurate diagnosis, if measles is to be eradicated or kept under control. It also
seems likely that multiple dose immunization schedules will be needed in the
future to maintain protective antibody levels and to protect children against
measles in Ghana. This will eliminate the frequent outbreaks of measles involving
immunized children.
