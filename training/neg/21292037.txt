The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system produces most of the 
ATP required by the cell. The structural proteins of the OxPhos holoenzymes are
well known, but important aspects of their biogenesis and regulation remain to be
uncovered and a significant fraction of mitochondrial proteins have yet to be
identified. We have used a high throughput, genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi)
approach to identify new OxPhos-related genes. We transduced a mouse fibroblast
cell line with a lentiviral-based shRNA-library, and screened the cell population
for growth impairment in galactose-based medium, which requires an intact OxPhos 
system. Candidate genes were ranked according to their co-expression with known
genes encoding OxPhos mitochondria-located proteins. For the top ranking
candidates the cellular process in which they are involved was evaluated. Our
results show that the use of genome-wide RNAi together with screening for
deficient growth in galactose medium is a suitable approach to identifying
OxPhos-related and cellular energy metabolism-related genes. Interestingly also
ubiquitin-proteasome related genes were selected.
