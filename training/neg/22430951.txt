Indirect immunofluorescence techniques targeting the rotavirus (RV) protein VP6
are used to differentiate RV species. The ICTV recognizes RV species A to E and
two tentative species, F and G. A potential new RV species, ADRV-N, has been
described. Phylogenetic trees and pairwise identity frequency graphs were
constructed with more than 400 available VP6 sequences and seven newly determined
VP6 sequences of RVD strains. All RV species were separated into distinct
phylogenetic clusters. An amino acid sequence cutoff value of 53% firmly
permitted differentiation of RV species, and ADRV-N was tentatively assigned to a
novel RV species H (RVH).
