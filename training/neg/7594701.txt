The safety, infectivity, immunogenicity, and phenotypic stability of the
cold-passaged (cp) candidate vaccine cp-45, a cold-adapted (ca),
temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of the JS strain of human parainfluenza virus
type 3 (HPIV-3), was evaluated in 114 children 6 months to 10 years old in a
randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The cp-45 vaccine was well
tolerated when given intranasally to parainfluenza virus type 3
(PIV-3)-seropositive and -seronegative children. With 10(4) or 10(5) TCID50 of
cp-45 vaccine, 86% of seronegative vaccines were infected, 83% of whom shed virus
at a mean peak titer of 10(22) pfu/mL. Virus present in respiratory specimens
retained the ts phenotype, and each of 86 PIV-3 isolates tested retained both the
ca and ts phenotypes. One dose of 10(5) TCID50 of vaccine induced a serum
hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody response in 81% of vaccinees; the geometric 
mean titer was 1:32. These studies indicate that the cp-45 HPIV-3 vaccine is
satisfactorily attenuated, infectious, immunogenic, and phenotypically stable and
merits further evaluation in infants and young children.
