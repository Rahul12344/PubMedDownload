The endogenous production of enzymes as zymogens provides a means to control
catalytic activities. Here, we describe the heterologous production of
ribonuclease 1 (RNase 1), which is the most prevalent secretory ribonuclease in
humans, as a zymogen. In folded RNase 1, the N and C termini flank the enzymic
active site. By using intein-mediated cis-splicing, we created circular proteins 
in which access to the active site of RNase 1 is obstructed by an amino-acid
sequence that is recognized by the HIV-1 protease. Installing a sequence that
does not perturb the RNase 1 fold led to only modest inactivation. In contrast,
the ancillary truncation of residues from each terminus led to a substantial
decrease in the catalytic activity of the zymogen with the maintenance of
thermostability. For optimized zymogens, activation by HIV-1 protease led to
a > 104 -fold increase in ribonucleolytic activity at a rate comparable to that
for the cleavage of endogenous viral substrates. Molecular modeling indicated
that these zymogens are inactivated by conformational distortion in addition to
substrate occlusion. Because protease levels are elevated in many disease states 
and ribonucleolytic activity can be cytotoxic, RNase 1 zymogens have potential as
generalizable prodrugs.
