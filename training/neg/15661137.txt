Zaire ebolavirus causes large outbreaks of severe and usually fatal hemorrhagic
disease in humans for which there is no effective treatment or cure. To
facilitate examination of early critical events in viral pathogenesis and to
identify antiviral compounds, a recombinant Zaire ebolavirus was engineered to
express a foreign protein, eGFP, to provide a rapid and sensitive means to
monitor virus replication in infected cells. This genetically engineered virus
represents the first insertion of a foreign gene into ebolavirus. We show that
Ebola-eGFP virus (EboZ-eGFP) infects known early targets of human infections and 
serves as an ideal model to screen antiviral compounds in less time than any
previously published assay.
