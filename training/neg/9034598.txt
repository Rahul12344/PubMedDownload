Many viral and non-viral vector systems have now been developed for gene therapy 
applications. In this article, the pros and cons of these vector systems are
discussed in relation to the different cancer gene therapy strategies. The
protocols used in cancer gene therapy can be broadly divided into six categories 
including gene transfer to explanted cells for use as cell-based cancer vaccines;
gene transfer to a small number of tumour cells in situ to achieve a vaccine
effect; gene transfer to vascular endothelial cells (VECs) lining the blood
vessels of the tumour to interfere with tumour angiogenesis; gene transfer to T
lymphocytes to enhance their antitumour effector capability; gene transfer to
haemopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to enhance their resistance to cytotoxic drugs and
gene transfer to a large number of tumour cells in situ to achieve nonimmune
tumour reduction with or without bystander effect. Each of the six strategies
makes unique demands on the vector system and these are discussed with reference 
to currently available vectors. Aspects of vector biology that are in need of
further development are discussed in some detail. The final section points to the
potential use of replicating viruses as delivery vehicles for efficient in vivo
gene transfer to disseminated cancers.
