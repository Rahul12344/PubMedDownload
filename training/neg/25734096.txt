BACKGROUND: We previously suggested that infection with the human T-lymphotropic 
virus type 1 (HTLV-1) subtype C is associated with bronchiectasis among
Indigenous Australians. Bronchiectasis might therefore result from an
HTLV-1-mediated inflammatory process that is typically associated with a high
HTLV-1 proviral load (PVL). Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 PVL have not been
reported for Indigenous Australians.
METHODS: Thirty-six Indigenous adults admitted with bronchiectasis from June 1,
2008, to December 31, 2009 were prospectively recruited and matched by age, sex, 
and ethno-geographic origin to 36 controls. Case notes and chest high-resolution 
computed tomographs were reviewed, and pulmonary injury scores were calculated. A
PVL assay for the HTLV-1c subtype that infects Indigenous Australians was
developed and applied to this study. Clinical, radiological, and virological
parameters were compared between groups and according to HTLV-1 serostatus.
RESULTS: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection was the main predictor of
bronchiectasis in a multivariable model (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 1.84; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.19-2.84; P = .006). Moreover, the median HTLV-1c PVL 
(interquartile range) for cases was >100-fold that of controls (cases, 0.319
[0.007, 0.749]; controls, 0.003 [0.000, 0.051] per 100 peripheral blood
lymphocytes; P = .007), and HTLV-1c PVL were closely correlated with
radiologically determined pulmonary injury scores (Spearman's rho = 0.7457; P =
.0000). Other predictors of bronchiectasis were positive Strongyloides serology
(aRR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.13-2.53) and childhood skin infections (aRR, 1.62; 95% CI, 
1.07-2.44). Bronchiectasis was the major predictor of death (aRR, 2.71; 95% CI,
1.36-5.39; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: These data strongly support an etiological association between
HTLV-1 infection and bronchiectasis in a socially disadvantaged population at
risk of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections.
