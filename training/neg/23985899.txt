Two new 9,11-secosteroids, 22α-acetoxy-24-methylene-3β,6α,11-trihydroxy-9,
11-seco-cholest-7-en-9-one (1) and 11-acetoxy-24-methylene-1β,3β,6α-trihydroxy-9,
11-seco-cholest-7-en-9-one (2), as well as two known norcembranoids,
5-epi-sinuleptolide (3) and sinuleptolide (4), were isolated from the soft coral 
Sinularia nanolobata. The structures of these metabolites were elucidated on the 
basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis. The anti-HCMV (human cytomegalovirus) 
activity of 1-4 and its cytotoxicity against selected cell lines were evaluated.
