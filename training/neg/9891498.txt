BACKGROUND: Malignancies of the oral cavity and oropharynx account for 31% of all
diagnosed cancers in India. In most cases, patients present with tumours that are
clinically stage III/IV where surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have not
been very effective. Hence, there is an urgent need for alternate treatment
modalities. Gene therapy is a recent development shown to be effective in various
malignancies. In this study we have attempted to cause bulk reduction in tumour
volume using the HSVtk/ganciclovir strategy, solely on the basis of the
'bystander' effect.
METHODS: Nude mouse xenograft tumours of human head/neck cancer were engrafted
with cells expressing viral thymidine kinase. After treatment with 8 mM
ganciclovir for 14 days, the treatment efficacy was monitored. A novel method has
been devised to evaluate cell kill microscopically in the whole tumour.
RESULTS: Of the 11 mice included in the study, 9 showed a significant reduction
in total tumour volume of treated versus control tumours (p = 0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Bulk reduction in tumour load can be brought about without use of
viral vectors for gene transfer solely by the bystander effect.
