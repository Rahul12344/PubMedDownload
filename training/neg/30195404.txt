Human noroviruses cause acute foodborne gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. In
this study, a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical biosensor was
fabricated for the detection of human norovirus using novel peptides as
recognition elements. The electrochemical biosensor was fabricated by assembling 
of eight novel peptides separately on the gold electrode and investigated their
efficiencies for sensing human noroviruses. Among eight peptides, NoroBP peptide 
coated onto the gold electrode exhibited a high binding affinity towards human
noroviruses, resulting a progressive decrease in current signals with increasing 
concentration of human norovirus (0-105 copies/mL). As a result,
NoroBP-nonFoul(FlexL)2-coated gold electrode acts an efficient electrochemical
biosensor for highly selective detection of human norovirus with a detection
limit of 1.7 copies/mL, which is 3-fold lower than the reported methods. The
developed electrochemical biosensor was successfully applied to detect human
norovirus prepared by standard procedure from oyster, which suggests that the
developed biosensor can be used as a very sensitive and selective point-of-care
bioanalytical platform for the detection of human norovirus in various food
samples.
