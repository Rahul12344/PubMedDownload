Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of human mortality particularly in association
with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Nocardia spp. has emerged as an
opportunistic infection especially in HIV patients. The high prevalence of TB and
HIV coupled with the lack of a definitive laboratory diagnosis for Nocardia spp. 
could lead to misdiagnosed pulmonary TB. This study determined the prevalence of 
pulmonary infections due to Nocardia spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in
sputum of HIV and non-HIV patients with suspected pulmonary tuberculosis at KATH.
A total of sixty sputum samples were obtained from HIV and non-HIV patients with 
suspected pulmonary tuberculosis. Samples were examined by fluorescence based
Ziehl-Neelsen staining, culture, and PCR methods. The prevalence of Nocardia spp.
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was 18.3% and 20%, respectively, with the latter
having the highest rate among patients aged 21-40 years (P=0.075). The prevalence
of Nocardia spp. among HIV patients was 90.9% whilst 16.7% of the patients had
HIV/Nocardia spp. coinfection. Detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by
fluorescence-based Ziehl-Neelsen staining, culture, and PCR yielded 9 (15%), 11
(18.3%), and 12 (20%), respectively. There is a high prevalence of nocardiosis
especially in HIV patients. PCR is a better diagnostic method that detects both
Nocardia spp. and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and should be incorporated into
routine diagnosis for pulmonary infections.
