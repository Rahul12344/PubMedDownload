Gene-based hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines have been proposed as a novel
approach to improve the immunogenicity toward non-responders and to allow for
protection against potential viral escape mutants. Furthermore, there is
significant interest in using DNA or viral vector vaccines to serve as
therapeutic agents to treat chronic HBV infections that are resistant to existing
drug therapies. However, the key protective antigen of HBV, the surface protein
(HBsAg), can be expressed in three different sizes due to its multiple
translational initiation sites: small, middle, and large forms of HBsAg. It is
not clear whether the immunogenicity of these HBsAg is same, especially their
ability to elicit HBsAg-specific B cell and T cell immune responses in addition
to the traditional serum HBsAg-specific antibody responses. In the current study,
the immunogenicity of three forms of HBsAg DNA vaccines was analyzed individually
in a mouse model. Our results indicated that different forms of the HBsAg have
unique immunogenicity profiles and this information is useful for the selection
of optimal gene-based HBV vaccines for further improved prophylactic and
therapeutic applications.
