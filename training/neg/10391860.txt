Several studies have suggested an association between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)
and multiple sclerosis (MS). We have previously studied intrathecal production of
antibody to lymphotropic herpesviruses in MS patients and the presence of human
herpesvirus 1 to 7 DNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the present study
anti-HHV-6 immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum and anti-HHV-6 IgG subclasses in serum
and CSF were examined and the lymphoproliferative response to HHV-6 was analyzed.
The PCR examination was refined by purifying DNA from CSF and retesting the
samples for HHV-6 DNA. There were no statistically significant differences
between the groups concerning IgM positivity, distribution of IgG subclasses, or 
lymphoproliferative response to HHV-6. The purification of DNA increased the
number of PCR-positive samples from 0 of 71 to 4 of 68. The study does not give
additional support to the possibility that HHV-6 is a common cause of MS, but a
role for the virus in a subset of patients cannot be excluded.
