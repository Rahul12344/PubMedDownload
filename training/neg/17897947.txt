Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a beta-herpesvirus that establishes latent and
persistent infections in mice, is a valuable model for studying complex
virus-host interactions. MCMV encodes the m145 family of putative immunoevasins
with predicted major histocompatibility complex, class I (MHC-I) structure.
Functions attributed to some family members include down-regulation of host MHC-I
(m152) and NKG2D ligands (m145, m152, and m155) and interaction with inhibitory
or activating NK receptors (m157). We present the cellular, biochemical, and
structural characterization of m153, which is a heavily glycosylated homodimer,
that does not require beta2m or peptide and is expressed at the surface of
MCMV-infected cells. Its 2.4-A crystal structure confirms that this compact
molecule preserves an MHC-I-like fold and reveals a novel mode of dimerization,
confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, and a distinctive disulfide-stabilized
extended N terminus. The structure provides a useful framework for comparative
analysis of the divergent members of the m145 family.
