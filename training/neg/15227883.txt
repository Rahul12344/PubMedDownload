SETTING: Prospective cohort study, Ethiopia.
OBJECTIVE: To study changes in biological markers of HIV infection progression
before and after development of TB disease.
DESIGN: A longitudinal study of 804 adult factory workers (95 HIV-positive, 709
HIV-negative), who were followed every 6 months for a median of 3.8 years.
RESULTS: Overall, the incidence rate of TB was 10/222 = 45.1 (95%CI 24.3-83.9)
per 1000 person-years of observation (PYO) among HIV-1-positive participants,
compared to 14/2054 = 6.8 (95%CI 4.0-11.5) per 1000 PYO among HIV-1-negative
participants (incidence rate ratio 6.62, 95%CI 2.94-14.9). Among the 10
HIV-positive participants who subsequently developed TB disease, the CD4 count
was low (median 201/microliter, range 45-419), and viral load high (median 4.97
log copies/ml, range 3.70-5.58), at the routine follow-up visit prior to TB
diagnosis. Following TB treatment, plasma viral load remained persistently
elevated despite clinical resolution of TB disease, and seven of the 10 patients 
died within a median time of 8 months.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, HIV-infected Ethiopians who developed TB disease
already had low CD4 counts and high viral load prior to the diagnosis of TB.
Viral load did not decrease following TB treatment, leading to a poor overall
prognosis in these patients.
