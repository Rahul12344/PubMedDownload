Three monoclonal antibodies were generated that are specific for the E2
glycoprotein of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus and have useful
reactivities in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Antibody 1A1B-9
distinguished between the IC (epizootic) and ID (enzootic) varieties of VEE virus
by ELISA. Clone 7A1A-1 antibody distinguished the Panamanian prototype virus
(3880) from Colombian ID isolates by a 500-fold difference in titer by endpoint
ELISA, and it detected antigenic variation in ID isolates from southern Colombia 
and Ecuador. Antibody 7A3A-4 defined a cryptic antigenic site on the latter two
isolates. These monoclonal antibodies complement others in identifying VEE
isolates by a simple ELISA.
