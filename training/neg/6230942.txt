Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, phage type 29/52/80, in Michigan.

Martin R, Adcock MP, Wentworth BB.

Staphylococcus aureus, phage type 29/52/80, caused an outbreak of infections in
Michigan over a period of two years and continues to be the most prevalent type
seen. Of 3,752 isolates typed in 1980-81, 25 per cent were this phage type, which
was strongly associated with methicillin resistance. Using this phage type as an 
indicator, we could demonstrate the spread of methicillin resistant staphylococci
from Detroit metropolitan hospitals to suburban and, to a lesser extent, to
hospitals outside the Detroit area.
