UV light inactivation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth and whole and semiskim milk was investigated using a
laboratory-scale UV machine that incorporated static mixers within UV-penetrable 
pipes. UV treatment proved to be less effective in killing M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis suspended in milk (0.5- to 1.0-log(10) reduction per 1,000
mJ/ml) than that suspended in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (2.5- to 3.3-log(10)
reduction per 1,000 mJ/ml). The FASTPlaqueTB phage assay provided more rapid
enumeration of surviving M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (within 24 h) than
culture on Herrold's egg yolk medium (6 to 8 weeks). Despite the fact that plaque
counts were consistently 1 to 2 log(10) lower than colony counts throughout the
study, UV inactivation rates for M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis derived using
the phage assay and culture results were not significantly different (P = 0.077).
