OBJECTIVE: To construct and identify the recombinant adenovirus of
muramidase-released protein (MRP) gene fragment from Streptococcus suis type 2
(SS2).
METHODS: The specific primers were designed based on the sequence of MRP gene
fragment. The MRP gene fragment (467-1351 bp) was amplified by PCR method with
genomic DNA of SS2 as a template. PCR products were cloned in pMD18-T vector.
Then MRP gene fragment was linked into the adenovirus shuttle plasmid
(pShuttle-CMV) to construct recombinant shuttle plasmid (pShuttle-CMV-MRP). After
PmeI digestion, it was transformed into BJ5183-AD-1 competent cells containing
adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1 to construct homogeneous recombinant
adenovirus plasmid (pAdeno-CMV-MRP). Then the recombinant adenovirus plasmid was 
linearized by PmeI and then transfected into AD-293 cells for viral packaging.
Finally, the virus liquid was tested by PCR and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed at 8 d after transfection of linear
pAdeno-CMV-MRP in AD-293 cells. MRP gene fragment and protein expression were
also detected in the virus liquid.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant adenovirus of MRP gene fragment (rAdeno-MRP) from SS2
was constructed successfully.
