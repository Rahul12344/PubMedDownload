Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease
worldwide. The diagnosis and monitoring of HCV infection is a crucial need in the
clinical management. The conventional diagnostic technologies are challenged when
trying to address molecular diagnostics, especially because they require a
complex and time-consuming sample preparation phase. Here, a new concept based on
surface functionalization was applied to viral RNA purification: first of all
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flat surfaces were modified to hold RNA adsorption.
After a careful chemical and morphological analysis of the modified surfaces, the
functionalization protocols giving the best RNA adsorbing surfaces were applied
to PDMS microdevices. The functionalized microdevices were then used for RNA
purification from HCV infected human plasma samples. RNA purification and RT were
successfully performed in the same microdevice chamber, saving time of analysis, 
reagents, and labor. The PCR protocol for HCV cDNA amplification was also
implemented in the microdevice, demonstrating that the entire process of HCV
analysis, from plasma to molecular readout, could be performed on-chip. Not only 
HCV but also other microdevice-based viral RNA detection could therefore result
in a successful Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics for resource-limited settings.
