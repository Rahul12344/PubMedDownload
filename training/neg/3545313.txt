A unified theory for the development of cancer.

Spandidos DA.

It is postulated that cancer is the result of genetic and epigenetic changes that
occur mainly in stem (precursor) cells of various cell types. I propose that
there are three classes of genes which are involved in the development of cancer.
These are: Class I, II and III oncogenes. The classification is based on the way 
the oncogene acts at the cellular level to further the development of cancer.
Genetic changes, that is point mutations, deletions, inversions, amplifications
and chromosome translocations, gains or losses in the genes themselves or
epigenetic changes in the genes (e.g. DNA hypomethylation) or in the gene
products (RNA or protein) are responsible for the development of cancer. Changes 
of oncogene activity have a genetic or epigenetic origin or both and result in
quantitative or qualitative differences in the oncogene products. These are
involved in changing normal cells into the cells demonstrating a cancer phenotype
(usually a form of dedifferentiated cell) in a multistep process. There are
several pathways to cancer and the intermediate steps are not necessarily defined
in an orderly fashion. Activation of a particular Class I or II oncogene and
inactivation of a Class III oncogene could occur at any step during the
development of cancer. Most benign or malignant tumors consist of a heterogeneous
mixture of dedifferentiated cells arising from a single cell.
