The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a prevalent human pathogen that causes persistent 
liver infections in most infected individuals; thus, efforts to develop a safe
vaccine, preventive and therapeutic, are urgently needed. Current approaches for 
the vaccine include the use of recombinant E1 and E2 proteins, synthetic
peptides, viral particles, viral vectors, DNA vaccines, dendritic cells, and
prime-boost strategies. However, several problems have been encountered:
restricted humoral and cell mediated responses, the low delivery of potentially
protective viral epitopes, and the low effectiveness of the adjuvants used in the
different protocols. Strong neutralizing antibodies and powerful cellular immune 
responses are required for an effective vaccine against HCV. New patents are
being developed to enhance both immune responses. The high prevalence of global
HCV infection obliges the development of new efforts in primary prevention;
therefore, a safe and efficient vaccine to confer protection against HCV is
urgently needed.
