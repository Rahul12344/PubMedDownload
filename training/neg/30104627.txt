Viruses are present in the intestinal microflora and are currently discussed as a
potential causative mechanism for the development of inflammatory bowel disease. 
A number of viruses, such as Human Herpesvirus-8, express homologs to cellular
FLIPs, which are major contributors for the regulation of epithelial cell death. 
In this study we analyzed the consequences of constitutive expression of
HHV8-viral FLIP in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in mice. Surprisingly,
expression of vFlip disrupts tissue homeostasis and induces severe intestinal
inflammation. Moreover vFlipIEC-tg mice showed reduced Paneth cell numbers,
associated with excessive necrotic cell death. On a molecular level vFlip
expression altered classical and alternative NFκB activation. Blocking of
alternative NFκB signaling by deletion of Ikka in vivo largely protected mice
from inflammation and Paneth cell loss induced by vFLIP. Collectively, our data
provide functional evidence that expression of a single viral protein in IECs can
be sufficient to disrupt epithelial homeostasis and to initiate chronic
intestinal inflammation.
