Antibodies specific for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) can be detected by diverse
methods, including ezyme-linked immunosortbent assay (ELISA) and virus
neutralization test (VNT). The VNT is superior in sensitivity and specificity and
is therefore considered the gold standard serological assay. Classical VNTs make 
use of virulent RVFV and therefore have to be performed in biosafety level 3
laboratories. Here, we report the development of a novel VNT that is based on an 
avirulent RVFV expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), which
can be performed safely outside level 3 biocontainment facilities. Evaluation
with a broad panel of experimental sera and field sera demonstrated that this
novel VNT is faster and more sensitive than the classical VNT.
