Viruses with genomes greater than 300 kb and up to 1200 kb are being discovered
with increasing frequency. These large viruses (often called giruses) can encode 
up to 900 proteins and also many tRNAs. Consequently, these viruses have more
protein-encoding genes than many bacteria, and the concept of small
particle/small genome that once defined viruses is no longer valid. Giruses
infect bacteria and animals although most of the recently discovered ones infect 
protists. Thus, genome gigantism is not restricted to a specific host or
phylogenetic clade. To date, most of the giruses are associated with aqueous
environments. Many of these large viruses (phycodnaviruses and Mimiviruses)
probably have a common evolutionary ancestor with the poxviruses, iridoviruses,
asfarviruses, ascoviruses, and a recently discovered Marseillevirus. One issue
that is perhaps not appreciated by the microbiology community is that large
viruses, even ones classified in the same family, can differ significantly in
morphology, lifestyle, and genome structure. This review focuses on some of these
differences than on extensive details about individual viruses.
