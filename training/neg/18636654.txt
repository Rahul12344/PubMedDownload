Hepatic steatosis: a benign disease or a silent killer.

El-Zayadi AR.

Steatosis is a common feature of many liver diseases, namely non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but the pathogenic 
mechanisms differ. Insulin resistance (IR), a key feature of metabolic syndrome, 
is crucial for NASH development, associated with many underlying genetically
determined or acquired mitochondrial and metabolic defects and culminates to
inflammation and progression to fibrosis. This may have potential implications
for new drug therapy. In HCV-related disease, steatosis impacts both fibrosis
progression and response to treatment. Steatosis in HCV-related disease relates
to both viral factors (HCV genotype 3), and host factors (alcohol consumption,
overweight, hyperlipidemia, diabetes). Among others, IR is a recognized factor.
Hepatic steatosis is reported to be associated with disturbance in the signaling 
cascade of interferon and downregulation of its receptors. Thus, hepatic
steatosis should not be considered a benign feature, but rather a silent killer.
