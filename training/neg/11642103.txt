Failure of drug therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) stimulated intense
search for adequate methods of gene therapy (GT) which would ensure effective
delivery of the dystrophin (D) gene, its long-term persistence in transfected
cells, and its expression in muscle fibers. The main results of the experimental 
GT of DMD with the use of viral and nonviral delivery of the D gene into muscles 
of biological models are discussed. Delivery of a mini-gene of D with a specific 
muscle promoter using a modified adenoassociated virus is currently the most
promising method, which will soon be available for clinical trials. The main
results of the studies on the DMD GT in Russia are summarized. The results of
experiments on genetic transfection of mdx mice with marker genes and various
constructions with the D gene are outlined. The genes are delivered into muscles 
by means of gene gun, electroporation, viral oligopeptides, liposomes,
microspheres, lactoferine, and other nonviral vehicles. It is emphasized that
consolidation of funds and efforts of all Russian laboratories dealing with gene 
and cell therapy of DMD are necessary to complete the experiments and start
clinical trials.
