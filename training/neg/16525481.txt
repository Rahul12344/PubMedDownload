Modification of dendritic cells (DCs) is a promising avenue for gene therapy
purposes, given the versatility and the multiplicity of functions of these cells.
In this study, we show that preincubation of monocyte-derived DCs with low
amounts of non-infectious virion-like particles derived from the simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV(MAC) VLPs) increases up to 10-fold the efficiency of 
transduction by HIV-1 lentiviral vectors at low multiplicity of infections
yielding up to 90% of transduced cells, in the absence of alterations of DCs
behavior. This effect is restricted to DCs and specified by the viral accessory
protein Vpx. Thus, preincubation with empty VLPs of SIV(MAC) can be used in
transduction protocols to increase the efficacy of HIV-1-mediated modification of
DCs.
