Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are a common cause of acute respiratory
illness throughout life. Infants, children, and the immunocompromised are the
most likely to develop severe disease. HPIV1 and HPIV2 are best known to cause
croup while HPIV3 is a common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. HPIVs
replicate productively in respiratory epithelial cells and do not spread
systemically unless the host is severely immunocompromised. Molecular studies
have delineated how HPIVs evade and block cellular innate immune responses to
permit efficient replication, local spread, and host-to-host transmission.
Studies using ex vivo human airway epithelium have focused on virus tropism,
cellular pathology and the epithelial inflammatory response, elucidating how
events early in infection shape the adaptive immune response and disease outcome.
