Rhabdomyolysis and compartment syndrome are rare but a limb-threatening
complication of viral myositis. Because of the potential for severe consequences 
of compartment syndrome, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion
when examining children with rhabdomyolysis due to viral myositis. We report a
case of recurrent bilateral thigh compartment syndrome in a patient with
influenza A, subtype pandemic H1N1-2009.CASE: An 8-year-old girl with a history
of rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure, and compartment syndrome secondary to
parainfluenza infection that resulted in release of her lower limb compartments
presented with a 3-day history of flu symptoms and increasing bilateral thigh
pain. Compartment syndrome was confirmed by intracompartmental pressure
measurements and comparison of intracompartmental pressure measurements to
diastolic blood pressure. The compartments were released. She also experienced
acute renal failure, which was treated by continuous renal replacement therapy
and hemodialysis. At her most recent orthopedic follow-up, she was doing well.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of recurrent rhabdomyolysis and
compartment syndrome as a complication of viral myositis. This case highlights
the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for compartment syndrome 
in the child with viral myositis.
