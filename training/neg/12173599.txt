OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is
hepatotropic.
METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from various tissues of 5 experimentally
infected Rhesus monkeys during the viremic period. A dot hybridization was done
with viral double stranded DNA probes or single antisense probes.
RESULTS: The double-stranded probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, bone
marrow, spleen,stomach, small intestine and colon. The single-stranded antisense 
probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, small intestine and bone marrow of 
all 5 monkeys, but not with that from other tissues.
CONCLUSIONS: As the viral genome was of negative polarity, the plus-stranded
fragment identified in our study might be a replicative intermediate, and was
only demonstrated in the liver, small intestine, and bone marrow by dot blot
hybridization with single-stranded antisense probes. It is suggested that the TTV
replicates in the liver, bone marrow and small intestine, and TTV might be
hepatotropic.
