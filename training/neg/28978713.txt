HIV-1-infected macrophages participate in virus dissemination and establishment
of virus reservoirs in host tissues, but the mechanisms for virus cell-to-cell
transfer to macrophages remain unknown. Here, we reveal the mechanisms for
cell-to-cell transfer from infected T cells to macrophages and virus spreading
between macrophages. We show that contacts between infected T lymphocytes and
macrophages lead to cell fusion for the fast and massive transfer of CCR5-tropic 
viruses to macrophages. Through the merge of viral material between T cells and
macrophages, these newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells acquire the
ability to fuse with neighboring noninfected macrophages. Together, these
two-step envelope-dependent cell fusion processes lead to the formation of highly
virus-productive multinucleated giant cells reminiscent of the infected
multinucleated giant macrophages detected in HIV-1-infected patients and simian
immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques. These mechanisms represent an original 
mode of virus transmission for viral spreading and a new model for the formation 
of macrophage virus reservoirs during infection.IMPORTANCE We reveal a very
efficient mechanism involved in cell-to-cell transfer from infected T cells to
macrophages and subsequent virus spreading between macrophages by a two-step cell
fusion process. Infected T cells first establish contacts and fuse with
macrophage targets. The newly formed lymphocyte-macrophage fused cells then
acquire the ability to fuse with surrounding uninfected macrophages, leading to
the formation of infected multinucleated giant cells that can survive for a long 
time, as evidenced in vivo in lymphoid organs and the central nervous system.
This route of infection may be a major determinant for virus dissemination and
the formation of macrophage virus reservoirs in host tissues during HIV-1
infection.
