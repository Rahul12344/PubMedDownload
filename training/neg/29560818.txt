The purposes of this study were to develop gain-framed (benefits of performing
behaviors) and loss-framed (costs of not performing behaviors) messages and to
identify the effects of these messages on human papillomavirus (HPV)-related
cervical cancer awareness and vaccination intention. Self-administered
questionnaires and effect-size measurements were used to evaluate the effects of 
the framed HPV vaccination messages delivered through multimedia. The results
showed that gain-framed and loss-framed messages equally improved HPV knowledge (
d = 2.147-2.112) and attitude toward HPV vaccination ( d = 0.375-0.422). The
intent to receive HPV vaccinations for cervical cancer prevention was higher in
the two intervention groups ( d = 0.369-0.378) in which the participants were
informed that public funding for the vaccination was available. Participants who 
received loss-framed HPV education messages paid statistically significantly more
attention to health education and expressed more concern for sexual health than
participants who received gain-framed HPV education messages.
