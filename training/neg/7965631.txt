Recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase was shown to
bind ATP and other nucleoside triphosphates and nucleotide analogs in vitro.
Cross-linking of ATP and the photoaffinity analog 8-azido-ATP to integrase
occurred in a UV dose-dependent manner. Covalent binding of ATP to integrase was 
also achieved without UV irradiation when the nucleotide was oxidized to the
2',3'-dialdehyde derivative (oxidized ATP) prior to incubation with the protein, 
indicating the presence of a reactive lysine residue in the nucleotide binding
region of the protein. A number of experimental observations indicate that
nucleotides and DNA substrates bind at the same or overlapping site(s) on the
integrase protein. For example, the binding of nucleotides or nucleotide analogs 
to integrase was blocked by prior incubation with DNA substrates, and the
covalent cross-linking of 8-azido-ATP to integrase inhibited the DNA binding and 
oligonucleotide cleavage activities of the protein. Oxidized ATP inhibited the
oligonucleotide cleavage activity of integrase at concentrations that had no
effect on DNA binding, suggesting that oxidized nucleotides may specifically
target the catalytic center of the enzyme. These studies indicate that nucleotide
analogs may serve as probes for the DNA binding and catalytic sites of the enzyme
and may serve as models for the design of active site inhibitors of retroviral
integrase.
