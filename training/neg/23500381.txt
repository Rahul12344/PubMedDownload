Six new lignans, schisphenlignans F-K (1-6), together with ten known ones, were
isolated from the leaves and stems of Schisandra sphenanthera. Their structures
were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods, including extensive NMR,
MS and CD spectra. In addition, some compounds were tested for their acute
activity on insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes and
anti-HIV-1 activity.
