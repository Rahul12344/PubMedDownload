On the 9th of November 2015, preceding the World Veterinary Vaccine Congress, a
workshop was held to discuss how veterinary vaccines can be deployed more rapidly
to appropriately respond to future epizootics in Europe. Considering their
potential and unprecedented suitability for surge production, the workshop
focussed on vaccines based on genetically engineered viruses and replicon
particles. The workshop was attended by academics and representatives from
leading pharmaceutical companies, regulatory experts, the European Medicines
Agency and the European Commission. We here outline the present regulatory
pathways for genetically engineered vaccines in Europe and describe the incentive
for the organization of the pre-congress workshop. The participants agreed that
existing European regulations on the deliberate release of genetically engineered
vaccines into the environment should be updated to facilitate quick deployment of
these vaccines in emergency situations.
