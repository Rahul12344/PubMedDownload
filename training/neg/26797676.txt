Cells contain powerful RNA decay machinery to eliminate unneeded RNA from the
cell, and this process is an important and regulated part of controlling gene
expression. However, certain structured RNAs have been found that can robustly
resist degradation and extend the lifetime of an RNA. In this review, we present 
three RNA structures that use a specific three-dimensional fold to provide
protection from RNA degradation, and discuss how the recently-solved structures
of these RNAs explain their function. Specifically, we describe the
Xrn1-resistant RNAs from arthropod-borne flaviviruses, exosome-resistant long
non-coding RNAs associated with lung cancer metastasis and found in Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and tRNA-like sequences occurring in certain
plant viruses. These three structures reveal three different mechanisms to
protect RNAs from decay and suggest RNA structure-based nuclease resistance may
be a widespread mechanism of regulation.
