Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections can cause considerable morbidity.
Currently, nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir are widely used for treatment. 
However, HSV infections resistant to these drugs are a clinical problem among
immunocompromised patients. To provide more efficient therapy and to counteract
resistance, a different class of antiviral compounds has been developed.
Pritelivir, a helicase primase inhibitor, represents a promising candidate for
improved therapy. Here, we established an HSV-1 infection model on
microneedle-pretreated human skin ex vivo. We identified HSV-1-specific
histological changes (e.g., cytopathic effects, multinucleated giant cells),
down-regulation of nectin-1, nuclear translocation of NF-κB (p65), interferon
regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and signaling of the IFN-inducible protein MxA.
Accordingly, this model was used to test the potency of pritelivir compared with 
the standard drug acyclovir. We discovered that both drugs had a comparable
efficacy for inhibiting HSV-1 replication, suggesting that pritelivir could be an
alternative therapeutic agent for patients infected with acyclovir-resistant
strains. To our knowledge, we present a previously unreported ex vivo HSV-1
infection model with abdominal human skin to test antiviral drugs, thus bridging 
the gap between in vitro and in vivo drug screening and providing a valuable
preclinical platform for HSV research.
