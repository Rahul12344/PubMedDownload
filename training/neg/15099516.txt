An ultrafast UV laser crosslinking assay has provided novel insights into the
progression of the SWI/SNF-mediated chromatin-remodeling reaction and
transcription factor binding in real time. We demonstrate site-specific
crosslinking between the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the hSWI/SNF
chromatin-remodeling complex, and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter
assembled in an array of correctly positioned nucleosomes. GR first demonstrates 
rapid binding to the promoter and then is actively displaced from the template
during the remodeling reaction. This displacement reaction requires the hSWI/SNF 
complex and ATP, is specific to the nucleoprotein template, and is accompanied by
a core histone rearrangement. The hSWI/SNF complex associates with random
positions on the chromatin template in the absence of GR but is recruited
specifically to the B/C region when GR is included. These results indicate that
enhancement of hSWI/SNF-mediated factor accessibility, a hallmark of chromatin
remodeling, is in some cases transient, reversible, and periodic.
