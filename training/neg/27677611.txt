Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses of the H5N1 subtype have been
diversified into multiple phylogenetic clades over the past decade and are highly
genetically variable. In June 2015, one outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in backyard
chickens was reported in the Nogardan village of the Mazandaran Province.
Tracheal tissues were taken from the dead domestic chickens (n = 10) and
processed for RT-PCR. The positive samples (n = 10) were characterized as HPAI
H5N1 by sequencing analysis for the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes.
Phylogenetic analysis of the samples revealed that the viruses belonged to clade 
2.3.2.1c, and cluster with the HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from different avian
species in Bulgaria, Romania, and Nigeria in 2015. They were not closely related 
to other H5N1 isolates detected in previous years in Iran. Our study provides new
insights into the evolution and genesis of H5N1 influenza in Iran and has
important implications for targeting surveillance efforts to rapidly identify the
spread of the virus into and within Iran.
