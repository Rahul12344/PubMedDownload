Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are proposed to be critical for protection from
intracellular pathogens such as Ebola virus. However, there have been no
demonstrations that protection against Ebola virus is mediated by Ebola
virus-specific CTLs. Here, we report that C57BL/6 mice vaccinated with Venezuelan
equine encephalitis virus replicons encoding the Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP)
survived lethal challenge with Ebola virus. Vaccination induced both antibodies
to the NP and a major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CTL response 
to an 11-amino-acid sequence in the amino-terminal portion of the Ebola virus NP.
Passive transfer of polyclonal NP-specific antiserum did not protect recipient
mice. In contrast, adoptive transfer of CTLs specific for the Ebola virus NP
protected unvaccinated mice from lethal Ebola virus challenge. The protective
CTLs were CD8(+), restricted to the D(b) class I molecule, and recognized an
epitope within amino acids 43 to 53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) in the Ebola virus NP. The
demonstration that CTLs can prevent lethal Ebola virus infection affects vaccine 
development in that protective cellular immune responses may be required for
optimal protection from Ebola virus.
