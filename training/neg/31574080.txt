Antagonistic interactions drive host-virus evolutionary arms races, which often
manifest as recurrent amino acid changes (i.e., positive selection) at their
protein-protein interaction interfaces. Here, we investigated whether
combinatorial mutagenesis of positions under positive selection in a host
antiviral protein could enhance its restrictive properties. We tested
approximately 700 variants of human MxA, generated by combinatorial mutagenesis, 
for their ability to restrict Thogotovirus (THOV). We identified MxA
super-restrictors with increased binding to the THOV nucleoprotein (NP) target
protein and 10-fold higher anti-THOV restriction relative to wild-type human MxA,
the most potent naturally occurring anti-THOV restrictor identified. Our findings
reveal a means to elicit super-restrictor antiviral proteins by leveraging
signatures of positive selection. Although some MxA super-restrictors of THOV
were impaired in their restriction of H5N1 influenza A virus (IAV), other
super-restrictor variants increased THOV restriction without impairment of IAV
restriction. Thus, broadly acting antiviral proteins such as MxA mitigate
breadth-versus-specificity trade-offs that could otherwise constrain their
adaptive landscape.
