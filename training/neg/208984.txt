Genetic transmission of mammary tumour virus in the DBAf mouse strain.

Verstraeten AA, van Nie R.

MTV antigens were demonstrable by radioimmunoassay in milk samples from
individual DBAf mice, and in samples from (male BALB/c X female DBAf) F1 mice.
Although some samples collected during the first lactation periods of these mice 
were virus-negative, all samples of later lactation periods were virus-positive. 
From 75 mice of the [ male BALB/c X female (male BALB/c X female DBAf)]Bc I
population, milk samples were collected during one or more lactation periods and 
tested for the presence of viral antigens; the samples of 42 mice were
virus-positive. In the ([BALB/c X (BALB/c X DBAf)] X BALB/c)Bc II population two 
groups were distinguished. In the first group, the progeny of virus-positive Bc I
mothers, 37 out of 62 mice had detectable levels of viral antigen in the milk.
None of the 43 samples from mice of the second group, derived from MTV-negative
Bc I females, were virus-positive. These data suggest that the presence of viral 
antigens in the milk of DBAf mice is controlled by a single dominant gene;
evidence for linkage of this gene and the albino locus was obtained
(recombination percentage: 20).
