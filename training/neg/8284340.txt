The authors conducted a study to examine the association between
neuropsychological markers of central nervous system impairment and systemic
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression in a sample of 64
HIV-positive asymptomatic patients who were followed for a median of 45.6 months.
Patients with poorer baseline scores on the Halstead-Reitan Trail-Making A
neuropsychological test developed HIV-related systemic symptoms earlier over the 
study period than patients with the higher scores on the same test (P < 0.05).
Subclinical neuropsychological dysfunction in otherwise asymptomatic HIV-infected
individuals may be a harbinger of progressive HIV-related immunologic
dysfunction.
