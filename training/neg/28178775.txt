Viral bronchiolitis is a common and costly condition among young children
worldwide, contributing to high medical expenditures in industrialized countries 
and significant mortality in low-income countries. Much research has focused on
therapy for this disease entity, though the standard of care remains merely
supportive. Current areas of active research include the nuances of defining
bronchiolitis, a deeper exploration of causative viruses, the role and
development of preventive strategies, and associated long-term outcomes. This
review aims to explore relevant recent literature, and particularly to focus on
active areas of uncertainty and controversy.
