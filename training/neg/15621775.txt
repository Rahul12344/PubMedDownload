Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with a diverse group of
malignancies including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC), and lymphoproliferative disease (LPD). EBV proteins expressed in
these malignancies provide targets for the adoptive immunotherapy with
antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and EBV-specific CTL have been used
successfully for the prophylaxis and treatment of EBV-LPD post hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT). The clinical experience with EBV-specific CTL for
other EBV-associated malignancies such as Hodgkin's disease and NPC is limited
and the results obtained so far indicate that EBV-specific CTL are less effective
than for EBV-LPD post HSCT. Decreased CTL efficacy most likely reflect immune
evasion strategies by tumor cells such as down regulation of immunodominant EBV
proteins and secretion of inhibitory cytokines. To overcome these immune evasion 
strategies a number of approaches have been developed including targeting CTL to 
subdominant EBV antigens and genetically modifying CTL to increase their potency.
