In this study, we developed composite chitosan beads combining various metal
ions, including Ni(2+), Cu(2+), Zn(2+), and Fe(2+), for direct adsorption of
enterovirus 71 (EV71). The metal-ion species had significant effects on the
adsorption capacity of beads. Among these metal ion-composite chitosan beads,
Ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibited the best adsorption capacity of EV71. Using a
concentration of 0.01-M Ni(2+) was found to best provide for bead formation and
EV71 adsorption. The adsorption of EV71 for Ni(2+)-chitosan beads at neutral or
alkaline pH was favored. Under a competitive condition with albumin proteins,
Ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibited significant capacity of EV71 adsorption in
culture media. The adsorption of EV71 on the Ni(2+)-chitosan beads was attributed
to the strong binding between Ni(2+) ions chelated to the surface amino acid of
EV71 capsids and Ni(2+) ions chelated on the chitosan materials. Moreover, the
adsorbed EV71 retained its antigenicity and infectivity after desorption. The
Ni(2+)-chitosan beads exhibit a promising application to EV71 adsorption and
removal.
