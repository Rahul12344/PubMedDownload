BACKGROUND: Although tobacco, alcohol abuse are well-recognized risk factors for 
oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), there is evidence to indicate that herpes
simplex virus (HSV) may also play some inducing role. The purpose of this study
was to investigate the presence of HSV in Iranian patients with OSCC using the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies of OSCC were obtained from 60 patients, 54 males 
and 6 females, aged between 36 and 80 years old. Paraffin-embedded,
histologically confirmed specimens were analyzed for the presence of HSV DNA
using PCR.
RESULTS: Only three samples (5%) was positive, suggesting that HSV may not play
an important role in this group of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HSV-1 positive sample in this study was 5%. It
shows that HSV-1 has no important role in OSCC.
