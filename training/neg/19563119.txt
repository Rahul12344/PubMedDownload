Recent advances in optical imaging and molecular manipulation techniques have
made it possible to observe the activity of individual enzymes and study the
dynamic properties of processes that are challenging to elucidate using
ensemble-averaging techniques. The use of single-molecule approaches has proven
to be particularly successful in the study of the dynamic interactions between
the components at the replication fork. In this section, we describe the methods 
necessary for in vitro single-molecule studies ofprokaryotic replication systems.
Through these experiments, accurate information can be obtained on the rates and 
processivities of DNA unwinding and polymerization. The ability to monitor in
real time the progress of a single replication fork allows for the detection of
short-lived, intermediate states that would be difficult to visualize in
bulk-phase assays.
