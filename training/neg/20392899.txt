Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is prevalent throughout the world and
interferon (IFN)-based treatments are currently the only therapeutic option.
However, depending upon variations in their human leukocyte antigen (HLA), some
patients do not respond well to IFN therapy. The current study evaluated the HLA 
allele and haplotype distribution of 204 HCV-seropositive individuals from
Islamabad, Pakistan, who were receiving standard IFN therapy. In this cohort, 150
patients (74%) showed a sustained virological response to IFN therapy, whereas 54
(26%) did not. In addition to the HCV patients, 102 unrelated healthy volunteers 
were used as controls. DNA was isolated from the blood of the patients and
controls for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 allele typing, whilst plasma was used for HCV 
detection and genotyping. HLA-DRB1*04 was found to impart a significant
protective advantage [Bonferroni-corrected P value (pc)=0.047] against HCV
infection. In patients on IFN therapy, HLA-DRB1*11 and -DQB1*0301 (pc=0.044) were
found to be associated with viral clearance. In contrast, HLA-DRB1*07 (pc=0.008) 
individually or in combination with HLA-DQB1*02 was found to be associated with
viral persistence. These associations of HLA with HCV persistence or clearance
will be beneficial in deciding the therapeutic regimen for Pakistani patients
infected with HCV genotype 3a.
