In eukaryotes, genomic processes like transcription, replication, repair, and
recombination typically require alterations in nucleosome structure on specific
DNA regions to operate. ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes provide a
major mechanism for carrying out such alterations in vivo. To learn more about
the action of these important complexes, we have utilized an atomic force
microscopy in situ technique that permits comparison of the same individual
molecules before and after activation of a particular process, in this case
nucleosome remodeling. This direct approach was used to look for changes induced 
by the action of the human Swi-Snf remodeling complex on individual, single-copy 
mouse mammary tumor virus promoter nucleosomal arrays. Using this technique, we
detect a variety of changes on remodeling. Many of these changes are larger in
scale than suggested from previous studies and involve a number of DNA-mediated
events, including a preference for the removal of a complete turn (80 basepairs) 
of nucleosomal DNA. The latter result raises the possibility of an unanticipated 
mode of human Swi-Snf interaction with the nucleosome, namely via the 11-nm
histone surface.
