Antiviral assays carried out on the potent benzothiadiazine dioxide (BTD) human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) inhibitors have led us to find marginal but selective
anti-HIV-1 activity. Specific pharmacological studies, such as time of addition
experiments and assays on specific viral strains with mutations on its reverse
transcriptase, have indicated that BTD compounds act as non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors. Theoretical calculations showed a butterfly
conformation for the active derivatives that are compatible with their mechanism 
of action. Therefore, BTD derivatives can be considered as potential lead
compounds for the treatment of opportunistic HCMV infections in immunocompromised
individuals such as AIDS patients.
