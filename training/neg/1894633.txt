We have examined the levels of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) mRNAs
encoding the erythroid-specific (ALAS-E) and the nonspecific (ALAS-N) ALAS
isozymes in murine Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Both
ALAS-E and ALAS-N mRNAs were detected in a clone of dimethyl sulfoxide
(Me2SO)-sensitive MEL cells, termed DS-19, without cross-hybridization. Untreated
DS-19 cells contained approximately 10-fold more ALAS-E mRNA than ALAS-N mRNA.
When DS-19 cells were treated with Me2SO or hemin, ALAS-N mRNA declined rapidly, 
which was followed by a marked increase in ALAS-E mRNA. Similarly, the
immunoquantifiable ALAS-N protein decreased, while the ALAS-E protein increased
upon Me2SO treatment. A clone of Me2SO-resistant cells, termed DR-1, which fails 
to undergo erythroid differentiation, was found to lack ALAS-E mRNA, whereas it
showed significant induction responses of mRNAs for other heme pathway enzymes by
Me2SO treatment. DR-1 cells contained a similar level of an erythroid-specific
transcription factor, GATA-1, as did DS-19 cells, and had neither major deletion 
nor rearrangement of the ALAS-E gene. These findings indicate that the genes
encoding the two ALAS isozymes are under separate controls and suggest that
ALAS-E mRNA accumulation is responsible for increased heme synthesis in MEL cells
undergoing erythroid differentiation.
