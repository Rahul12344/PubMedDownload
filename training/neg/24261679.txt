The role of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in the pathogenesis of
low-grade B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) has not been studied. We therefore 
investigated the incidence of latent EBV infection in a group of patients with
leukemic low-grade B-NHL, as well as the incidence of viral latent membrane
protein 1 (LMP1) oncoprotein expression in the same patient group. Furthermore,
in an attempt to elucidate the role of this viral oncoprotein in non-EBV-related 
lymphomas, we correlated the expression of LMP1 with the level of oxidative
stress, a parameter related to apoptosis. In the present study we detected lower 
levels of oxidative stress in the sera of LMP1-positive patients. This possibly
implies an anti-apoptotic role of this viral oncoprotein in low-grade B cell
lymphomas. However, LMP1 expression status did not affect expression of the major
anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2.
