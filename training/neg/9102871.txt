Frequency of HCV infection was examined in patients on chronical program of
hemodialysis considering the high risk to which they had been exposed because of 
frequent blood transfusion. We determined anti-HCV antibodies in 57 patients (29 
male and 28 female) average age 52.6 years with terminal chronic renal failure.
Frequency of anti-HCV antibodies (determined by ELISA Ortho test of first
generation) was in correlation with the number of received transfusions and with 
duration of dialysis treatment and it was compared with anti-HCV antibody
findings in hemodialysis staff (the control group of healthy persons). Results of
the examination showed that anti HCV antibodies were positive in 38.95% examined 
patients (n = 57), and it showed that the patients on hemodialysis were a
critical group for HCV infection. There was no correlation with the blood groups.
Level of transaminases, HBsAg and immunity test in anti-HCV positive patients
were in the physiological range. In order to prevent HCV infection in the
dialysis centres, it is necessary to conduct routine test in patients and staff, 
and undertake all measures of protection.
