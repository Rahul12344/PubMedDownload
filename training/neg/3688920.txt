Twenty five patients with encephalitis were studied prospectively, and their
clinical and virological features compared with outcome. Among 22 patients with
laboratory confirmation of virus infection, evidence of direct effect on the
central nervous system by the virus occurred significantly more often both in
those with a monophasic illness compared with those with a biphasic illness, and 
in those with focal neurological signs localising in the cerebral hemispheres
compared with those without such signs. Young age at presentation, low score on
the Glasgow coma scale, disruption of oculocephalic responses, and laboratory
evidence of virus infection within the central nervous system were significantly 
associated with poor outcome. Computed tomography results, concentrations of
creatine phosphokinase BB isoenzyme in cerebrospinal fluid, and procoagulant
activity in cerebrospinal fluid were not predictive of outcome.
