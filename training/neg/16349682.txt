Five adenoviruses were effectively concentrated and partially purified by
methanol precipitation. The soluble antigens from one adenovirus concentrate were
obtained by adsorption to and elution from calcium phosphate.
Formaldehyde-inactivated vaccines prepared from the virus concentrates were more 
antigenic in guinea pigs than a National Institutes of Health reference vaccine
or one prepared from unconcentrated adenovirus. The soluble antigens also proved 
to be antigenic. The data indicate that adenovirus vaccines of superior potency
can be prepared from concentrated virus preparations and that the extracted
soluble antigens are immunogenic.
