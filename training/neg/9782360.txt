The 3'-portion of the genome from a Taiwan isolate of porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus, strain MD-001, was cloned and sequenced. The
resultant 549 nucleotides contained an open reading frame with a coding capacity 
of 123 amino acids (predicted Mr 13,600). The predicted protein corresponds to
the nucleocapsid protein, the gene product of ORF7. Comparative sequence analysis
of several known PRRSV strains indicated that this protein showed the highest
degree of amino acid similarity to the US VR2332 and the Canadian IAF-Exp91
strains (92.7%) and the least to the Dutch Lelystad strain (56.5%). The
phylogenic trees constructed on the basis of the known PRRSV nucleotide sequences
indicated that MD-001 strain belongs to the North American strain cluster and
that it is distinct from the European virus.
