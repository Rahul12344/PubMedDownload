Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III beta (PI4KIIIβ) is an essential enzyme in
mediating membrane transport, and plays key roles in facilitating viral
infection. Many pathogenic positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses activate
PI4KIIIβ to generate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-enriched organelles 
for viral replication. The molecular basis for PI4KIIIβ activation during viral
infection has remained largely unclear. We describe the biochemical
reconstitution and characterization of the complex of PI4KIIIβ with the Golgi
protein Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing protein 3 (ACBD3) and Aichi
virus 3A protein on membranes. We find that 3A directly activates PI4KIIIβ, and
this activation is sensitized by ACBD3. The interfaces between PI4KIIIβ-ACBD3 and
ACBD3-3A were mapped with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).
Determination of the crystal structure of the ACBD3 GOLD domain revealed a unique
N terminus that mediates the interaction with 3A. Rationally designed
complex-disrupting mutations in both ACBD3 and PI4KIIIβ completely abrogated the 
sensitization of 3A activation by ACBD3.
