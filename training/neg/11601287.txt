OBJECTIVE: To obtain full-length sequence of a Chinese hepatitis G virus (HGV)
strain (HGVch) and investigate the genetic characteristic of HGVch and its
identity to other isolates.
METHODS: Reverse transcription (RT) and nested-PCR were used to screen HGV RNA
positive serum and amplify cDNA fragments. A positive serum without known
hepatitis virus markers was selected for isolating HGV RNA template. The HGV
genome was divided into 12 overlapping fragments and directly cloned into pGEM-T 
vector. Sequences were determined by dideoxy terminus-end method of DNA
sequencing and then analyzed by computer.
RESULTS: The twelve fragments of HGVch cover 9213 nucleotides in length,
containing a large open reading frame (ORF) encoding 2873 animo acids polyprotein
that began with a methonine residue and ended at termination codon. HGVch is
about 86.5%-89.5% identical to other known HGV isolates at the nucleotide level
and about 93.9%-96.2% at the deduced animo acid level.
CONCLUSION: HGV is a non-A-E hepatitis causal agent, proved to be related with
posttransfusion hepatitis in all over the world. Chinese HGV isolate has very
close relationship to other isolates from Africa, Europe, Japan, without
significant difference across the entire genome. It is suggested that the
sequences of HGV isolates are very conservative and the evolution is very slow.
