Incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma has remained high in endemic regions.
Diagnosing the disease in the early stages requires a high index of clinical
acumen and, although most cross-sectional imaging investigations show the tumour 
with precision, confirmation is dependent on histology. Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-encoded RNA signal is present in all nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, and
early diagnosis of the disease is possible through the detection of raised
antibodies against EBV. The quantity of EBV DNA detected in blood indicates the
stage and prognosis of the disease. Radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy
has increased survival, and improved techniques (such as intensity-modulated
radiotherapy), early detection of recurrence, and application of appropriate
surgical salvage procedures have contributed to improved therapeutic results.
Screening of high-risk individuals in endemic regions together with developments 
in gene therapy and immunotherapy might further improve outcome.
