OBJECTIVE: Viral infections and sensitization to aeroallergens are major factors 
in the exacerbation of asthma and its development during early childhood.
However, the cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation status linked to the
association between viral infections and sensitization to aeroallergens are
incompletely understood. Here we investigated respiratory viruses, serum
eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and various cytokines/chemokines in acute
exacerbation of childhood asthma.
METHODS: We analyzed peripheral eosinophil counts, serum ECP, and 27
cytokines/chemokines in 76 virus-induced acute asthma cases with or without
aeroallergen sensitization. Asthma due to sensitization was defined by a positive
reaction to at least one aeroallergen in serum specific IgE antibody tests. Virus
detection was performed using antigen detection kits and/or RT-PCR, followed by
direct DNA sequencing analysis. Serum cytokines/chemokines were measured using a 
multi-cytokine detection system.
RESULTS: Peripheral eosinophil counts and serum ECP and IL-5 levels were
significantly elevated in sensitized cases compared with nonsensitized cases.
Conversely, IP-10 values were significantly higher in nonsensitized cases. An
inverse correlation between IP-10 and IL-5 production was identified in
virus-induced acute exacerbations of asthma but not in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine profiles and eosinophil activation status might be
different between sensitized and nonsensitized cases of virus-induced acute
exacerbations of asthma.
