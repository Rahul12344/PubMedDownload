Peripartum cytokine flares in a multiethnic cohort of chronic hepatitis B
carriers does not correlate with hepatitis B virus suppression or increased risk 
of liver disease.

PROBLEM: In chronic hepatitis B (CHB) carriers, alanine transaminase (ALT) flares
are common in the peripartum period. There are limited data on immunological
changes of pregnancy in CHB. We hypothesize that in pregnant CHB carriers, the
Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio is altered resulting in changes in biochemical/virological
and liver fibrosis markers.
STUDY METHODS: Serum from 38 pregnant/post-partum CHB carriers (median age
32 years, 53% Asian, 8 HBeAg+ ) was tested for HBV DNA, quantitative HBV surface 
antigen, ALT and liver fibrosis by transient elastography (TE). Serum cytokines
were analyzed using a Luminex assay.
RESULTS: Untreated CHB cases had mild ALT flares post-partum, but showed normal
TE, and no change in viral markers despite increased Th1 cytokines compared to
healthy controls (P<.05).
CONCLUSION: CHB carriers show increased Th1 cytokines in the peripartum period
albeit with no effect on viral load or liver disease suggesting an aborted
antiviral immune response.
