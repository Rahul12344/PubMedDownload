Seven temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants of Abelson murine leukaemia virus
(A-MuLV) were isolated on the basis of the temperature dependence of their soft
agar colony-forming ability. These seven ts mutants exhibited similar
characteristics and were not ts for morphological transformation and
autophosphorylation of P120gag-abl protein. The dissociation of the properties of
morphology, soft agar colony formation and tyrosine kinase activity might suggest
that the v-abl product has more than one primary intracellular target.
