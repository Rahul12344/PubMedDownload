Background: Understanding differences in HIV incidence among people living with
hepatitis C virus (HCV) can help inform strategies to prevent HIV infection. We
estimated the time to HIV diagnosis among HCV-positive individuals and evaluated 
factors that could affect HIV-infection risk in this population.
Patients and methods: The British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort includes all 
BC residents (~1.5 million: about a third of all residents) tested for HCV and
HIV from 1990 to 2013 and is linked to administrative health care and mortality
data. All HCV-positive and HIV-negative individuals were followed to measure time
to HIV acquisition (positive test) and identify factors associated with HIV
acquisition. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) were estimated using Cox proportional-hazard
regression.
Results: Of 36,077 HCV-positive individuals, 2,169 (6%) acquired HIV over 266,883
years of follow-up (overall incidence of 8.1 per 1,000 person years). Overall
median (IQR) time to HIV infection was 3.87 (6.06) years. In Cox regression,
injection-drug use (aHR 1.47, 95% CI 1.33-1.63), HBV infection (aHR 1.34, 95% CI 
1.16-1.55), and being a man who has sex with men (aHR 2.78, 95% CI 2.14-3.61)
were associated with higher risk of HIV infection. Opioid-substitution therapy
(OST) (aHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.52-0.67) and mental health counseling (aHR 0.48, 95% CI
0.43-0.53) were associated with lower risk of HIV infection.
Conclusion: Injection-drug use, HBV coinfection, and being a man who has sex with
men were associated with increased HIV risk and engagement in OST and mental
health counseling were associated with reduced HIV risk among HCV-positive
individuals. Improving access to OST and mental health services could prevent
transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections, especially in settings
where access is limited.
