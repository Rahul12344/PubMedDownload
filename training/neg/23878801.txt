Many biomedical applications absolutely require, or are substantially enhanced
by, coexpression of multiple proteins from a single vector. Foot-and-mouth
disease virus 2A (F2A) and "2A-like" sequences (e.g., Thosea asigna virus 2A;
T2A) are used widely for this purpose since multiple proteins can be coexpressed 
by linking open reading frames (ORFs) to form a single cistron. The activity of
F2A "cleavage" may, however, be compromised by both the use of shorter versions
of F2A and the sequences (derived from multiple-purpose cloning sites) used to
link F2A to the upstream protein. To characterise these effects, different
lengths of F2A and T2A were inserted between green and cherry fluorescent
proteins. Mutations were introduced in the linker region immediately upstream of 
both F2A- and T2A-based constructs and activities determined using both cell-free
translation systems and transfected cells. In shorter versions of F2A, activity
may be affected by both the C-terminal sequence of the protein upstream and,
equally strikingly, the residues immediately upstream introduced during cloning. 
Mutations significantly improved activity for shorter versions of F2A but could
decrease activity in the case of T2A. These data will aid the design of cloning
strategies for the co-expression of multiple proteins in
biomedical/biotechnological applications.
