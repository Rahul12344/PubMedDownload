BACKGROUND: Although Chikungunya virus has rapidly expanded to several countries 
in sub-Saharan Africa, little attention has been paid to its control and
management. Until recently, Chikungunya has been regarded as a benign and
self-limiting disease. In this report we describe the first case of severe
Chikungunya disease in an adult patient in Pemba, Mozambique.
CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 40 year old male of Makonde ethnicity
with no known past medical history and resident in Pemba for the past 11 years
presented with a severe febrile illness. Despite administration of broad spectrum
intravenous antibiotics the patient rapidly deteriorated and became comatose
while developing anaemia, thrombocytopenia and later, melaena. Laboratory testing
revealed IgM antibodies against Chikungunya virus. Malaria tests were
consistently negative.
CONCLUSIONS: This report suggests that Chikungunya might cause unsuspected severe
disease in febrile patients in Mozambique and provides insights for the
improvement of national protocols for management of febrile patients in
Mozambique. We recommend that clinicians should consider Chikungunya in the
differential diagnosis of febrile illness in locations where Aedes aegypti
mosquitos are abundant.
