We studied the impact of a first post-transplant cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection 
greater than one year after primary kidney transplantation. Risk factors for
developing late CMV were acute rejection and donor-recipient CMV status. Of those
developing late CMV, 35% were donor (D) positive, recipient (R) negative;
however, 23% were D+R+, 22% D-R+, and 15% D-R-. Late CMV was associated with
significantly decreased patient and graft survival.
