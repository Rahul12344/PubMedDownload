Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a member of the family Retroviridae, genus
Deltaretrovirus that has three important gene including gag, pol and env. This
virus causes B-cell lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma in cows. In the first step
PCR product of gag gene of BLV isolated in different regions of Iran and BLV-FLK 
strain were cloned in to a pTZ57R/T vector, then insert were digested by BglII
and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned in to pET-28(a) as an expression vector. 
For the expression of p24 protein, the pET-28(a) recombinant vector was
transformed in BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli competent cell and after induction of 
the protein having been expressed by IPTG, the presence of gag expressed protein 
was shown in immunoblotting and SDS-PAGE system. With respect to the remarkable
frequency of infection to BLV in Iran and the necessity of controlling it through
vaccination with recombinant vaccines of gp51, manufacturing and applying the
recombinant p24 protein are vital goals in recognition and distinction between
infection and responses caused by vaccine.
