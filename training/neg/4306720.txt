Substiuted sialic acid prosthetic groups as determinants of viral
hemagglutination.

Levinson B, Pepper D, Belyavin G.

Inhibitors of hemagglutination by type A2 influenza virus and a recently isolated
strain of type B influenza virus were separated by sucrose density gradient
centrifugation and agarose gel filtration from horse serum. Using selected
reagents, it was demonstrated that the active substituent on the horse serum
inhibitor of A2 influenza virus was 4-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid; however, 
the active substituent on the inhibitor of the influenza B virus was shown to be 
N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA). Sodium metaperiodate treatment of a component of 
horse serum resulted in a 10 to 15-fold enhancement of inhibitory activity
against the type B virus, whereas the A2 inhibitor was completely destroyed.
Since this enhancement did not occur with influenza B viruses isolated prior to
1965, it was considered that this sensitivity to an oxidized NANA glycoside may
have been a reflection of an antigenic change which occurred at that time. The
use of different virus strains and selected chemical reagents to define the
important sialic acid prosthetic groups active in inhibition was described.
