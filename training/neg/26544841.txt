BACKGROUND: The WHO estimated the annual rotavirus-related mortality among
children below 5 years old in Egypt in 2004 to be 30 deaths per 100 000, or out
of an estimated 2616 deaths, 3.9% were because of rotavirus infection. The aim of
this article was to study the epidemiology and circulating genotypes of
rotaviruses in Cairo from 2011 to 2012.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 197 stool samples were collected from 130
inpatient children at the Cairo University Children Hospital and 67 outpatient
children at the Al-Saff Children Clinic. The collected stool samples were then
screened for rotavirus using enzyme immunoassay, followed by a screening for
G-type and P-type using RT-PCR, and confirmation by sequence analysis.
RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 39.1% (77/197) of the children, with a higher 
rate in inpatients (43.9%, 57/130) than in outpatients (29.9%, 20/67). There was 
an increase of rotavirus infection in the winter season. The majority of
rotavirus cases (85.7%) occurred during the first year of life. The predominant
genotypes identified during this study were G3P[8] (37.7%) and G1P[8] (19.5%),
but uncommon genotypes G1P[6] (3.9%), G9P[6] (1.3%), G8P[14] (1.3%), and G12P[6] 
(2.6%) were also detected.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The change in genotype distribution, compared
with previous studies, along with the high burden of rotavirus-associated
diarrhea among Egyptian children below 2 years old, emphasizes the importance of 
continuing strain surveillance and the need of developing and introducing
rotavirus vaccine in Egypt.
