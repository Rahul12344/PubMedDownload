The influence of the incubation period and the amount of antigen on the
haemagglutination inhibition titres to Newcastle disease virus.

de Jong WA.

An investigation was made into the significance of incubation period and amount
of antigen used in the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for Newcastle
disease virus in chicken serum. Also the results of a manually performed
macrotest were compared with those of an automated microtest. Both incubation
period and amount of antigen greatly influenced the HI titres. In incubating sera
the titres increased up to 75 or 120 minutes when respectively 2 or 4
haemagglutinating units per volume were used. By contrast they became stable
after 45 minutes' incubation with 8 units per volume. It was concluded that the
latter combination gave optimum results. There were no significant differences
between the results obtained with the macro and the micro technique.
