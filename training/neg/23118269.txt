Persistent nontreponemal titers after treatment are common among patients with
early syphilis. We retreated 82 human immunodeficiency virus-negative early
syphilis participants who were serofast at 6 months using benzathine penicillin. 
Only 27% exhibited serological response after retreatment and after an additional
6 months of follow-up.
