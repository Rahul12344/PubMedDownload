To perform structure/function analyses of a protein in vivo, ideally one should
be able to simultaneously abolish expression of the endogenous wild-type protein,
substitute it with a form of the protein containing a targeted mutation, and
analyze the functional consequences. Until recently, this was a highly
challenging and/or laborious approach in mammalian systems, requiring a targeted 
gene knockin in a human cell line or mouse. Herein is described a RNA
interference (RNAi)-based approach to achieve this much more simply in mammalian 
cells. A single retrovirus has been constructed, which directs expression of a
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knockdown expression of the endogenous protein of
interest; a cDNA coding for a wild-type or mutant version of the same protein
that also contains "silent mutations" that do not affect the protein sequence,
but do make the mRNA resistant to the shRNA; and a puromycin-resistance gene to
allow rapid drug selection of the virus-infected cells. Using this virus,
expression of the endogenous Anti-Silencing Function 1a (ASF1a) histone chaperone
has been efficiently replaced in primary human cells, by an ectopically expressed
epitope-tagged version. Moreover, the virus is designed so that other shRNA and
shRNA-resistant cDNA cassettes can easily be substituted, making the approach
readily applicable to other protein targets.
