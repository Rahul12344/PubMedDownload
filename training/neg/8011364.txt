Derivatives of the lac promoter (tac, pac, rac) belong to the strongest bacterial
promoters which are frequently used for the induced overexpression of foreign
genes in Escherichia coli. However, their use in fermentation processes is
strongly restricted because of the high cost of the inducer
iso-propyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The aim of this work was to
investigate the possibility of using lac-derived promoters in high cell density
processes resulting in a high yield of the induced recombinant protein if glucose
is the main carbon and energy source. Lactose is tested as inducer of the main
antigenic coat protein (VP1) of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus in a
T7-RNA polymerase expression system. It was shown that lactose is able to induce 
the expression of the recombinant gene to an amount of the VP1 protein
corresponding to 20% of the total cell protein.
