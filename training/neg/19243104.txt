The nanoindentation response of empty viral capsids is modeled using
three-dimensional finite element analysis. Simulation with two different
geometries, spherical and icosahedral, is performed using the finite element code
Abaqus. The capsids are modeled as nonlinear Hookean elastic, and both small and 
large deformation analysis is performed. The Young's modulus is determined by
calibrating the force-indentation curve to data from atomic force microscopy
(AFM) experiments. Force-indentation curves for three different viral capsids are
directly compared to experimental data. Predictions are made for two additional
viral capsids. The results from the simulation showed a good agreement with AFM
data. The paper demonstrates that over the entire range of virus sizes (or
Foppl-von Karman numbers) spherical and icosahedral models yield different force 
responses. In particular, it is shown that capsids with dominantly spherical
shape (for low Foppl-von Karman numbers) exhibit nearly linear relationship
between force and indentation, which has been experimentally observed on the
viral shell studies so far. However, we predict that capsids with significant
faceting (for large Foppl-von Karman numbers) and thus more pronounced
icosahedral shape will exhibit rather nonlinear deformation behavior.
