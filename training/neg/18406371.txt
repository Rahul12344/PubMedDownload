Mast cells are not only potent effector cells in allergy, but are also important 
players in protective immune responses against pathogens. Most of our knowledge
about mast cells in innate immunity is derived from models of sepsis, whereas
their role in innate immune responses of the skin has largely been neglected in
the past. Their particular pattern of distribution in the skin and their ability 
to sense and react to pathogens and other danger signals indicate that mast cells
can be important sentinels and effector cells in skin immune responses. The
recent findings reviewed here have confirmed this hypothesis and have established
a prominent role for skin mast cells in innate immunity.
