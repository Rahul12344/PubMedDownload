Organ shortage remains a major problem in liver transplantation for which the
number of patients on the waiting list is superior to the number of liver grafts 
harvested each year. In 2007, 1061 liver transplantations have covered 78.7% of
the needs for 1348 new candidates. Improvement of the results (5 year-survival
74.9% and 63% at 10 years) do not influence the number of major indications
(hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis C virus, alcohol), despite a slight decrease
in the rate of activity of 1 to 2% per year. Introduction of the national score
for each patient to be registered on the waiting list, the use of split grafts or
grafts from marginal criteria donors may enlarge the donor pool. Liver grafts
from cardiac deceased donors or from living donors are less frequent and are
controversial from a technical and psychological point of view. The most
efficient solution in order to overcome organ shortage is the increase in the
pool of brain dead donors by accompanying people acceptance of organ donation and
the use of parts of human body after death. Such education of the population
could be made by the valorisation of organ donation, through public campaigns
suggesting reflexion rather than coercition.
