The incidence of acute gastrointestinal and acute respiratory infections was
measured in 2 groups of approximately 750 Gambian children aged 3-59 months
during a 3-year period. One group of children was partially protected against
malaria by fortnightly chemoprophylaxis with Maloprim whilst children in the
other group were infected much more frequently. Mortality from acute
gastroenteritis and from acute respiratory infections was similar in the 2
groups. The proportions of children in each group who complained of
gastrointestinal or severe respiratory symptoms on morbidity surveillance were
also similar. Thus, no evidence was found to suggest that malaria plays either a 
direct or indirect role in causing acute gastrointestinal or respiratory
infections in young children in The Gambia.
