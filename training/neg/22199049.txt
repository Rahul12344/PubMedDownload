Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is increasing world-wide and highly 
active antiretroviral treatment (HAAT) is allowing afflicted individuals to live 
near normal life span and acquire surgical diseases of the aged as in the
unaffected population. This pose occupational hazards to operating surgeons
especially in tropical Africa where the seroprevalence is so high that
seroconversion in the medical staff contaminated with the virus is estimated to
be as much as 15 times (per annum) more than what obtains in developed. A 63-year
old man was admitted to our Hospital with urethral catheter in situ and having
failed medical therapy, he opted for transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) which was
done without any post-operative complication. He was known to be afflicted with
human immunodeficiency virus and on treatment for 3 years. He also had a large
but reducible inguinoscrotal hernia for 4 years attributed to lower urinary tract
obstruction. He had a Lichtenstein repair of right inguinoscrotal hernia which
was complicated by small hematoma that was evacuated. The risk of transmission
and surgical morbidity during transurethral prostatectomy could be minimized by
adequate universal precaution, pre-testing of all consented patients and wise
selection of patients that would benefit from such surgical therapy.
