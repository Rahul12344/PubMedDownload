OBJECTIVE: To clone the DNA of a TT virus (TTV) variant isolated from a patient
with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) of unknown etiology, and conduct
sequence analysis.
METHODS: The long fragment of TTV DNA was amplified by nested PCR and then cloned
into pGEM-T vector. A clone named 56-B containing 3.2 kb TTV DNA was selected for
sequence analysis besides homology analysis with other 5 TTV variants retrieved
from GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out by maximum likelihood
method.
RESULTS: The nucleotide identities of 56-B with the other 5 TTV strains TA278,
JA10, US35, SANBAN and TUS01 were 42.4%, 48.2%, 47.9%, 49.8 % and 61.7 %
respectively, and the corresponding amino acid identities were even lower.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that 56-B was far from other TTV strains in genetic 
distance that ranged from 0.344 to 0.458. However, the sequences in the 5'- and
3'-end were still much conservative.
CONCLUSION: The isolated 56-B showed high heterogeneity in genetic background and
was therefore quite distinct from other TTV strains as a novel TTV variant that
represents a new TTV genotype.
