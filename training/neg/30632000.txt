During the 40 years since the Yale conference on Behavioral Medicine and the
founding of the Journal of Behavioral Medicine considerable progress has been
made in understanding the role of psychosocial risk and management of physical
diseases. We here describe the development of these fundamental concepts from
early research on stress through studies of the Type A behavior pattern to more
contemporary approaches to the relationship between psychosocial risks and
benefits in relation to disease processes. This includes the relationship of
psychosocial risk to cancers, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cardiometabolic
disorders, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Human Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. During the past 40 years the effects of prolonged distress responses in
the pathogenesis of some cancers and CVD have been well-established and
modifiable behavioral, cognitive and social factors have been shown to produce
favorable outcome components in the management of such diseases as breast cancer,
coronary heart disease and HIV.
