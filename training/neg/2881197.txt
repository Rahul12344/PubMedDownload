Different functional domains of the adenovirus E1A gene are involved in
regulation of host cell cycle products.

We have analyzed the cell cycle effects that different domains of the adenovirus 
E1A proteins have on quiescent primary BRK cells. Studies with deletion mutants
that in combination removed all but the N-terminal 85 amino acids common to both 
the 12S and 13S proteins suggest that this region may be sufficient for the
induction of synthesis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and the stimulation 
of DNA synthesis. A second domain also common to the N-terminal exon of the 12S
and 13S proteins was required for the induction of mitosis and stimulation of
proliferation of primary BRK cells. A virus containing a mutation in this region 
was still able to stimulate DNA synthesis efficiently. A third domain, unique to 
the 13S protein, was required for the accelerated activation of the cellular
thymidylate synthase gene in a manner similar to the 13S-dependent stimulation of
adenovirus early region genes.
