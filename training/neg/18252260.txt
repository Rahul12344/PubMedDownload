Three full-length genomic clones (pB19-M20, pB19-FL and pB19-HG1) of parvovirus
B19 were produced in different laboratories. pB19-M20 was shown to produce
infectious virus. To determine the differences in infectivity, all three plasmids
were tested by transfection and infection assays. All three clones were similar
in viral DNA replication, RNA transcription, and viral capsid protein production.
However, only pB19-M20 and pB19-HG1 produced infectious virus. Comparison of
viral sequences showed no significant differences in ITR or NS regions. In the
capsid region, there was a nucleotide sequence difference conferring an amino
acid substitution (E176K) in the phospholipase A2-like motif of the VP1-unique
(VP1u) region. The recombinant VP1u with the E176K mutation had no catalytic
activity as compared with the wild-type. When this mutation was introduced into
pB19-M20, infectivity was significantly attenuated, confirming the critical role 
of this motif. Investigation of the original serum from which pB19-FL was cloned 
confirmed that the phospholipase mutation was present in the native B19 virus.
