Lentiviral based constructs represent a recent development in the generation of
transgenic animals. The ease of use, and the fact that the same backbone vectors 
can be used to down-modulate endogenous gene expression and to produce transgenic
animals overexpressing a gene of interest, have fuelled growing interest in this 
technology. In this study, we have used a lentiviral delivery system to generate 
transgenic mice expressing altered levels (up or downregulated) of a gene of
interest. Although this lentiviral-based approach led to high levels of
transgenesis and germ line transmission, a wide variation in transgene expression
was observed in most first and second generation mouse lines. In particular,
despite the segregation of integrants into single-copy expressing mouse lines,
transgene expression appeared to be the target of epigenetic regulatory
mechanism, often causing the coexistence of high and low transgene expressing
cells within a given tissue such as blood peripheral lymphocytes. The
establishment and analysis of large number of mouse lines may therefore be
required to select a stable transgenic line with pancellular expression of a gene
of interest using this lentiviral-based approach.
