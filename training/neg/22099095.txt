Astroviruses cause diarrhea, but it is not known whether they circulate in human 
plasma. Astrovirus MLB2 was recently discovered in diarrhea samples from
children. We detected MLB2 in the plasma of a febrile child, which suggests that 
MLB2 has broader tropism than expected and disease potential beyond the
gastrointestinal tract.
