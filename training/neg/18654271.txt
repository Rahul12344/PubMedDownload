Interaction of spherical particles with cells and within animals has been studied
extensively, but the effects of shape have received little attention. Here we use
highly stable, polymer micelle assemblies known as filomicelles to compare the
transport and trafficking of flexible filaments with spheres of similar
chemistry. In rodents, filomicelles persisted in the circulation up to one week
after intravenous injection. This is about ten times longer than their spherical 
counterparts and is more persistent than any known synthetic nanoparticle. Under 
fluid flow conditions, spheres and short filomicelles are taken up by cells more 
readily than longer filaments because the latter are extended by the flow.
Preliminary results further demonstrate that filomicelles can effectively deliver
the anticancer drug paclitaxel and shrink human-derived tumours in mice. Although
these findings show that long-circulating vehicles need not be nanospheres, they 
also lend insight into possible shape effects of natural filamentous viruses.
