Cytopathic effects of oat sterile dwarf virus in enation cells of oat leaves.

Brcák J, Králík O.

A Czechoslovak isolate of oat sterile dwarf virus caused thickening or distortion
of cell walls and induced the formation of viroplasms containing incomplete virus
particles in gall phloem. These effects were similar to those caused by other
plant reoviruses but no tubular structures containing rows of virions were found.
Dense bodies of a similar diameter to virions were occasionally seen inside
mitochondria. Complete virions were distributed at random in the cytoplasm but
clusters of virions were sometimes enclosed within a membrane. No crystalline
arrays of virions were seen. Late in infection parenchyma cells contained
membranous structures formed by membranes about 11 nm thick, close to viroplasms.
As the cells degenerated further, there occurred scrolls of membranes, about 150 
nm in diameter. Unbound masses of fine fibrous and tubular structures, strongly
resembling P-protein, occurred in the cytoplasm. The fibrils were about 5 nm in
diameter and the unbranched tubes 21 nm wide. Only complete virions were seen in 
these structures.
