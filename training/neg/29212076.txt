OBJECTIVES: Resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) in the integrase of different 
HIV-1 subtypes were investigated in a cohort of patients never exposed to
integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs).
METHODS: The viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples of 53 INSTI-naïve
patients, and the integrase genetic region was sequenced and analyzed for subtype
assignment and drug resistance.
RESULTS: The median viral load at sampling was 5.28 × 104 RNA copies/mL. Bayesian
phylogenetic analysis showed 85% of the HIV-1 isolates were non-B subtypes, with 
a predominance of subtypes C (22.6%) and CRF01_AE (26.4%). A total of 52 and 110 
mutations were found in the integrase region of HIV-1 B and non-B subtypes,
respectively. Nonpolymorphic INSTI-RAMs were not detected in this study. However,
the accessory mutation E157Q was found in 1 patient with CRF02_AG, and the
polymorphic mutations L74M/I that may contribute to a reduced susceptibility to
INSTIs in the presence of major mutations were observed in 6 (13.3%) patients
with non-B subtypes and 1 (12.5%) patient with the B subtype. Polymorphic
mutations at positions known to harbor primary and accessory RAMs were also
detected in this study.
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the importance of monitoring the emergence of
INSTI-RAMS before and after the initiation of INSTI-based therapy.
