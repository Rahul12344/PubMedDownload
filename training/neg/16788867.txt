INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis is the most important disabling neurological
disease in young adulthood in our environment. However, its etiology remains
unknown. It has been proposed that multiple sclerosis is caused by an interaction
of genetic and environmental factors. In particular, Epstein-Barr virus infection
could play a fundamental role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis.
METHODS: We have reviewed the most recent and important bibliography, both from
epidemiologic and basic research studies, dealing with the possible association
between Epstein-Barr virus infection and multiple sclerosis.
RESULTS: Retrospective and prospective epidemiologic studies suggest a direct
association between Epstein-Barr virus infection and the risk of multiple
sclerosis. Several physiopathologic mechanisms, including molecular mimicry and
bystander activation, could be responsible for this association.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the published evidence, Epstein-Barr virus infection can be
considered to have a causal role in the etiology of multiple sclerosis. Further
research should be conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying this
association and to assess its potential for multiple sclerosis prevention and
treatment.
