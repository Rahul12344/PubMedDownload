Most pathogens require a relatively long period of development in their mosquito 
vector before they can be transmitted to a new human host; hence, only older
insects are of epidemiological importance. The successful transfer of a
life-shortening strain of the inherited bacterial symbiont, Wolbachia, into the
major mosquito vector of dengue, Aedes aegypti, halved adult life span under
laboratory conditions. The association is stable, and the Wolbachia strain is
maternally inherited at high frequency. It is capable of inducing complete
cytoplasmic incompatibility, which should facilitate its invasion into natural
field populations and its persistence over time. Our data suggest that targeting 
mosquito age with inherited Wolbachia infections may be a viable strategy to
reduce the transmission of pathogens such as dengue viruses.
