The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is abundantly
expressed in HIV-1-infected astrocytes and shares amino acid sequence homology to
alpha-scorpion toxins which bind to potassium channels. Here we report effects of
recombinant Nef and alpha-scorpion toxins on membrane potassium transport in
human U251 astroglioma cells. 86Rb+ was utilized as a tracer for potassium
movements and potassium channel activity was studied by single-channel
patch-clamp techniques. Results showed inactivation of a large-conductance
potassium channel when Nef was added to the inner leaflet of the cell membrane of
inside-out patches of U251 cells. Extracellular addition of Nef or alpha-scorpion
toxins to intact glial cells did not alter potassium transport.
