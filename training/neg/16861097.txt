BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen overdose is a frequent cause of acute liver failure.
Controversy exists over the rare association of severe hepatotoxicity or acute
liver failure with therapeutic doses of acetaminophen.
CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old white man weighing 85 kg with asymptomatic HIV,
hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection presented with signs of 
severe hepatotoxicity: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 8,581 IU/L; alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), 5,433 IU/L; L-lactate dehydrogenase, 13,641 IU/L; and
prothrombin international normalized ratio, 2.15. He reported taking
acetaminophen 1,000 mg QID for the previous 4 days and 1,000 mg that morning
because of a febrile illness. Immediate administration of continuous IV
N-acetylcysteine 150 mg/kg for the first 90 minutes and then 50 mg/kg q4h for the
next 3 days was followed by clinical improvement and a rapid decrease in AST and 
ALT. AST levels decreased from 8,581 to 42 IU/L within 11 days. Several potential
risk factors for acetaminophen hepatotoxicity (ie, chronic alcohol, tobacco, and 
opiate consumption, malnutrition, illness-induced starvation, HIV infection, and 
HCV infection) were present in this patient.
CONCLUSIONS: This patient with multiple risk factors and severe hepatotoxicity
after therapeutic dosage of acetaminophen was successfully treated with
N-acetylcysteine.
