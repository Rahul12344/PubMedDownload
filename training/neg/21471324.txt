Since their emergence in 1996 in southern China, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza viruses have spread widely and continue to circulate in some countries.
Genetic reassortment has created multiple H5N1 virus lineages, some of which are 
dominant in nature. However, the mechanism by which certain H5N1 influenza virus 
lineages (or genotypes) become dominant in avian species remains unknown. Here,
we used competitive inoculation and genetic analysis of the resultant viruses to 
show that the nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M) segments of Fujian-like
viruses (clade 2.3.4), which became predominant in southern China in mid-2006,
are responsible for viral dominance in embryonated eggs. We further found that
specific residues in the NP and M proteins play key roles in conferring this
viral dominance; specifically, a glutamic acid at position 66 in M2 was conserved
among the Fujian-like viruses. These results suggest roles for these viral
proteins in influenza virus dominance.
