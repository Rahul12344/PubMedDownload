This study aimed to evaluate the use of routinely collected reproductive and milk
production data for the early detection of emerging vector-borne diseases in
cattle in the Netherlands and the Flanders region of Belgium (i.e., the northern 
part of Belgium). Prospective space-time cluster analyses on residuals from a
model on milk production were carried out to detect clusters of reduced milk
yield. A CUSUM algorithm was used to detect temporal aberrations in model
residuals of reproductive performance models on two indicators of gestation
length. The Bluetongue serotype-8 (BTV-8) epidemics of 2006 and 2007 and the
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) epidemic of 2011 were used as case studies to evaluate 
the sensitivity and timeliness of these methods. The methods investigated in this
study did not result in a more timely detection of BTV-8 and SBV in the
Netherlands and BTV-8 in Belgium given the surveillance systems in place when
these viruses emerged. This could be due to (i) the large geographical units used
in the analyses (country, region and province level), and (ii) the high level of 
sensitivity of the surveillance systems in place when these viruses emerged.
Nevertheless, it might be worthwhile to use a syndromic surveillance system based
on non-specific animal health data in real-time alongside regular surveillance,
to increase the sense of urgency and to provide valuable quantitative information
for decision makers in the initial phase of an emerging disease outbreak.
