Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the leading causes of cancer death
worldwide, and its incidence has been increasing in the last decade largely in
parallel to the incidence and duration of exposure to hepatitis B and C. The
widespread implementation of hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B antivirals, and the
introduction of direct antiviral therapies for hepatitis C virus may have a
substantial impact in reducing the incidence of HCC. This report reviews the risk
factors and underlying mechanisms associated with the development of HCC in
hepatitis B, along with advances in the diagnosis, imaging, and management of
HCC.
