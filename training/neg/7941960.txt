This study is a report of 34 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) observed in
Bangalore (South India), an endemic area for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
infection. Virological and immunological findings suggested an antecedent and
recent JEV infection in 21/34 patients. Nineteen patients among them showed high 
levels of JEV-specific IgM antibodies in serum and/or CSF, while the viral
antigen could be demonstrated in one case and virus isolation from the CSF was
successful in one patient. EMG studies revealed features of predominantly
demyelinating neuropathy in 18/25 cases. Comparison of clinical findings,
duration of illness and outcome in GBS patients with evidence of JEV infection
and those without did not reveal any differences. Pathological findings in one
patient corroborated the association of JEV with GBS. We conclude that, JEV
infection may predispose to Guillain-Barré syndrome in endemic areas.
