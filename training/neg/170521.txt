Failure of neutral-red photodynamic inactivation in recurrent herpes simplex
virus infections.

Myers MG, Oxman MN, Clark JE, Arndt KA.

Because photodynamic inactivation of herpes simplex virus infections may not be
free of hazard, the efficacy of photodynamic inactivation with neutral red and
light was evaluated in a placebo-controlled study of 170 episodes of recurrent
herpes simplex virus infection in 96 patients. The preparation of neutral red
that was used was shown to photoinactivate herpes simplex virus in vitro, but had
no significant effect on the rate of resolution of herpetic lesions (P greater
than 0.10) or on the frequency of subsequent recurrences (P greater than 0.10),
except for orolabial lesions, in which an adverse effect on the rate of
subsequent recurrences was observed (P less than 0.05). In the absence of
demonstrated efficacy, the routine use of neutral red and light in patients with 
recurrent herpes simplex virus infections should be discontinued. Furthermore,
other photoactive dyes should not be used until their efficacy has been
demonstrated by suitably controlled clinical trials.
