A 3-year study was conducted to determine if testing mosquitoes collected in
modified sentinel chicken boxes for West Nile virus (WNV) or testing sentinel
chickens for WNV antibody would detect WNV activity before onset of human cases
in East Baton Rouge Parish, LA. In each year mosquitoes tested positive for WNV
before the onset of human cases were detected, but seroconversions of sentinel
chickens were detected after the human cases occurred. In 1 year we also compared
the effectiveness of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light
traps, gravid traps, and sentinel chicken box traps for collecting WNV-positive
mosquitoes. Gravid traps collected more WNV-positive mosquitoes than CDC light
traps or sentinel chicken box traps. However, WNV was detected earlier in
mosquitoes collected from sentinel chicken box traps than in mosquitoes collected
with gravid traps or CDC light traps. In total, 1,222 pools containing 19,353
mosquito specimens representing 18 species were tested for WNV. West Nile virus
was detected in 59 mosquito pools from 4 species; 87% of the positive pools were 
detected from Culex quinquefasciatus, which was the most abundant species
collected in all 3 years.
