Breda and Breda-like viruses: diagnosis, pathology and epidemiology.

Woode GN.

Breda virus serotype 1 (Iowa) was isolated from a severe outbreak of neonatal
calf diarrhoea in which 15% of the diarrhoeic animals died. Two further isolates,
one from Iowa and one from Ohio, are antigenically related to the first isolate
but belong to the Breda virus serotype 2 group by haemagglutination inhibition
and by immuno-electron microscopy (IEM). The majority (88.5%) of cattle are
serologically positive for Breda virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA). The diagnostic methods of choice should include a combination of
electron microscopy, IEM, haemagglutination inhibition or ELISA, in order to
identify all serotypes of Breda virus. Serotypes 1 and 2 infect and replicate in 
crypt and epithelial cells of the small intestine, from the mid jejunum region
posteriorly through to the descending colon. Virus replicates in and is released 
from cells before the appearance of microscopic lesions and clinical signs.
Diarrhoea starts within 24-72 hours of infection and death can occur within 36-48
hours after the onset of diarrhoea. The morphology of Breda virus, determined by 
negative staining and from ultrastructural studies of infected cells, is unique
and probably diagnostic. Little is known about the epidemiology, other than that 
transmission is faecal-orally and may require close contact. Large quantities of 
virus are released in the faeces.
