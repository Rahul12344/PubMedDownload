Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic cytoplasmic aggregates of translationally
silenced mRNAs that assemble in response to environmental stress. SGs appear to
play an important role in antiviral innate immunity and many viruses have evolved
to block or subvert SGs components for their own benefit. Here, we demonstrate
that intracellular Ebola virus (EBOV) replication and transcription-competent
virus like particles (trVLP) infection does not lead to SG assembly but leads to 
a blockade to Arsenite-induced SG assembly. Moreover we show that EBOV VP35
represses the assembly of canonical and non-canonical SGs induced by a variety of
pharmacological stresses. This SG blockade requires, at least in part, the
C-terminal domain of VP35. Furthermore, results from our co-immunoprecipitation
studies indicate that VP35 interacts with multiple SG components, including
G3BP1, eIF3 and eEF2 through a stress- and RNA-independent mechanism. These data 
suggest a novel function for EBOV VP35 in the repression of SG assembly.
