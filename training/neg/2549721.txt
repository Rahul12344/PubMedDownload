Alterations in intracellular monovalent cation concentrations in Sindbis
virus-infected avian cells result, in part, from a reduction in Na+/K+ ATPase
(Na+ pump) activity. Inhibition of Na+ pump activity was shown previously to
temporally correlate with the appearance of viral envelope proteins on the cell
surface and the release of virus particles. Cells infected with
envelope-defective temperature-sensitive mutants exhibited reduced Na+ pump
activity at the nonpermissive temperature, where viral particles are not
released. By contrast, Na+ pump activity was not inhibited in Sindbis
virus-infected cells treated with tunicamycin or with antiviral serum, which
block virus maturation and release. Diuretic-sensitive transport of 86Rb+, aK+
tracer, was stimulated in cells which express virus envelope proteins, but fail
to release virus particles. In these cells, the furosemide-sensitive 86Rb+ influx
exhibited an increase in Vmax and was responsive to changes in the extracellular 
concentration of NaCl. Furosemide inhibited the rapid release of virus from low
salt-inhibited cells after shift to isotonic conditions. Alterations in ion
transport during alphavirus infection may, therefore, facilitate the efficient
release of progeny virus particles.
