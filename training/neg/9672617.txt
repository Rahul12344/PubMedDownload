Human calicivirus Sapporo (SV) has typical calicivirus morphology and causes
acute gastroenteritis in children. The nucleotide sequence of 3.2 kb of the 3'
end of SV was determined from a cloned cDNA. The 3' end of the SV genome is
predicted to encode the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region, the capsid protein
and two small open reading frames. The nonstructural and capsid protein coding
sequences in the SV genome are fused in a single open reading frame. The
organization of these proteins in the SV sequence is similar to that of rabbit
hemorrhagic disease virus and the recently described Manchester virus, and
distinct from the genome organization of the prototype human calicivirus, Norwalk
virus, that lacks typical calicivirus morphology and has been described as a
small round structured virus (SRSV). Sequence analysis of the predicted capsid
region showed that the SV capsid is longer by approximately 30 amino acids than
the capsid of any of the SRSVs, and multiple sequence alignments showed that
these additional amino acids are located in the variable region of the capsid
protein. Expression of the capsid protein of SV in insect cells resulted in the
self-assembly of virus-like particles that have a morphology similar to that of
the native virus. This result shows that calicivirus morphology is determined by 
the primary sequence of the capsid protein.
