Phenobarbital is an old antiepileptic drug used in severe epilepsy. Despite this,
little is written about the need for dose adjustments in renal replacement
therapy. Most sources recommend a moderately increased dose guided by therapeutic
drug monitoring.A 14 year old boy with nonketotic hyperglycinemia, a rare inborn 
error of metabolism, characterized by high levels of glycine, epilepsy,
spasticity, and cognitive impairment, was admitted to the emergency department
with respiratory failure after a few days of fever and cough. The boy was
unconscious at admittance and had acute renal and hepatic failure.Due to the
acute respiratory infection, hypoxic hepatic and renal failure occurred and the
patient had a status epilepticus.The patient was intubated and mechanically
ventilated. Continuous renal replacement therapy was initiated. Despite increased
phenobarbital doses, therapeutic levels were not reached until the dose was
increased to 500 mg twice daily. Therapeutic drug monitoring was performed in
plasma and dialysate. Calculations revealed that phenobarbital was almost freely 
dialyzed.Correct dosing of drugs in patients on renal replacement therapy may
need a multidisciplinary approach and guidance by therapeutic drug monitoring.
