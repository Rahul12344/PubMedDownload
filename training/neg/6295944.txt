Interferon production by leukocytes infiltrating the lungs of mice during primary
influenza virus infection.

Wyde PR, Wilson MR, Cate TR.

Lung fluids and leukocytes were obtained from unprimed C3H mice by transpleural
lavage at intervals after infection with influenza A/Hong Kong/68 virus and were 
tested for interferon activity. Lavage fluid interferon titers correlated
directly with lung virus titers and with initial increases in leukocyte yields
from infected lungs. In contrast to cultured lymph node cells from infected
animals or leukocytes from lungs of uninfected mice, washed leukocytes obtained
from the lungs of mice infected 2 to 6 days earlier produced interferon
spontaneously in culture. The physiochemical, biological, and antigenic
properties of both the interferon in lavage fluids and that produced by lung
lavage leukocytes were similar and characteristics of alpha interferon.
Fractionation studies indicated that macrophages and T lymphocytes were primarily
responsible for the interferon produced in culture. The early presence and
significant numbers of interferon-producing leukocytes in infected lungs suggests
that these cells have an early role in defense against influenza virus infection.
