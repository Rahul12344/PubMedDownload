Individuals who are deficient in humoral immunity are particularly at risk from
infection with enteroviruses, and poliovirus in particular, where antibodies are 
the main source of protection from disease. Long-term excretion of vaccine
strains of poliovirus has been documented for many years and instances of
paralytic poliomyelitis in hypogammaglobulinaemic patients who were subsequently 
found to have been excreting virus for prolonged periods have been reported in
the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. The identification of a healthy immunodeficient
patient in the U.K. who has probably been excreting type 2 poliovirus for 15
years will be described, with the characteristics of the virus and the results of
attempts at treatment so far. Such individuals pose a significant risk to the
eradication programme unless they can be identified and treated.
