BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heart and lung transplantation is a high-risk
procedure requiring intensive immunosuppressive therapy for preventing organ
rejection. Alemtuzumab, a CD52-specific monoclonal antibody, is increasingly used
for induction therapy compared with conventional agents. However, there has been 
no systematic review comparing its efficacy with traditional therapeutic drugs.
METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched to October 1, 2017, for articles on
alemtuzumab in cardiothoracic transplant surgery. Of the 433 studies retrieved, 8
were included in the final meta-analysis.
RESULTS: In lung transplantation, alemtuzumab use was associated with lower odds 
of acute cellular rejection compared with antithymocyte globulin (odds ratio
[OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.40; P < .001), lower acute rejection rates (OR, 0.12; 
95% CI, 0.03-0.55; P < .01), and infection rates (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.35-1.36;
P = .33) when compared with basiliximab. Multivariate meta-regression analysis
found that mean age, male sex, single lung transplant, double lung transplant,
cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus status, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
cystic fibrosis, and mean ischemic time did not significantly influence acute
rejection outcomes. For heart transplantation, alemtuzumab use was associated
with lower acute rejection rates when compared with tacrolimus (OR, 0.44; 95% CI,
0.30-0.66; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab use was associated with lower rejection rates when
compared with conventional induction therapy agents (antithymocyte globulin,
basiliximab, and tacrolimus) in heart and lung transplantation. However, this was
based on observational studies. Randomized controlled trials are needed to verify
its clinical use.
