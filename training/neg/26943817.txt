Fatal Ebola virus infection is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response 
similar to septic shock. Ebola glycoprotein (GP) is involved in this process
through activating dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. However, the mechanism 
is unclear. Here, we showed that LSECtin (also known as CLEC4G) plays an
important role in GP-mediated inflammatory responses in human DCs. Anti-LSECtin
mAb engagement induced TNF-α and IL-6 production in DCs, whereas silencing of
LSECtin abrogated this effect. Intriguingly, as a pathogen-derived ligand, Ebola 
GP could trigger TNF-α and IL-6 release by DCs through LSECtin. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that LSECtin initiated signaling via association with a
12-kDa DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and induced Syk activation. Mutation of
key tyrosines in the DAP12 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif
abrogated LSECtin-mediated signaling. Furthermore, Syk inhibitors significantly
reduced the GP-triggered cytokine production in DCs. Therefore, our results
demonstrate that LSECtin is required for the GP-induced inflammatory response,
providing new insights into the EBOV-mediated inflammatory response.
