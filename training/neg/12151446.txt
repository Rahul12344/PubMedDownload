BACKGROUND: Couples in whom the man is infected by human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) increasingly request assisted reproductive technology (ART) to allow safe
procreation. Semen quality is critical in such situations.
METHODS: Semen characteristics were evaluated in 189 HIV-infected men requesting 
ART. At the time of semen analysis all men were healthy and 177 were receiving
anti-retroviral therapy. Comparisons were made with HIV-seronegative men,
partners of women requiring IVF because of tubal infertility, after matching for 
age and sexual abstinence delay.
RESULTS: The most significant semen alterations found in the HIV-infected men
were reduced percentages of rapidly progressive sperm [median (range), 10%
(0-30%) compared with 15% (5-30%) in the controls, P < 0.001], and increased
concentrations of non-spermatic cells [3 x 10(6)/ml (0.2-16 x 10(6)/ml) compared 
with 1.1 x 10(6)/ml (0.1-14 x 10(6)/ml) in the controls, P < 0.001]. HIV-infected
men also showed lower ejaculate volumes [2.8 ml (0.6-9.3 ml) compared with 3.6 ml
(1.1-11 ml), P < 0.05] and total sperm counts [262.5 x 10(6) (0-1003 x 10(6))
compared with 310.5 x 10(6) (48.3-1679 x 10(6)), P < 0.05].
CONCLUSIONS: Semen evaluation in a large population of HIV-infected men
requesting ART evidenced several alterations. Some of these anomalies might be
related to anti-retroviral treatments.
