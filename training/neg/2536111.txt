The complete DNA sequence of the human polyomavirus AS virus (ASV) is presented. 
Although ASV can be differentiated antigenically from the other human
polyomaviruses (BK and JC viruses), it shares 94.9% homology at the nucleotide
level with the Dunlop strain of BK virus. Differences found in ASV relative to BK
virus include the absence of tandem repeats in its regulatory region, the
deletion of 32 nucleotides in the late mRNA leader region (altering the
initiation codon for the agnoprotein), the presence of a cluster of base pair
substitutions within the coding region of the major capsid protein, VP1, and the 
absence of 4 amino acids in the carboxy-terminal region of the early protein, T
antigen. The 43 nucleotides deleted in the Dunlop strain of BK virus relative to 
the Gardner prototype strain of BK virus are present in ASV. Possible reasons for
the distinct antigenicity of the ASV capsid, given the high degree of nucleotide 
homology with BK virus, are discussed. To reflect the high degree of sequence
homology between ASV and BK virus, we suggest ASV be renamed BKV(AS).
