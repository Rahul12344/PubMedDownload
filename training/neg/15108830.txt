Nearly three million persons in the United States are viremic with hepatitis C
(HCV). Despite a decreasing incidence of HCV in this country, the prevalence of
HCV-related chronic liver disease is increasing. Most infections in the United
States are acquired by intravenous drug use. The chronicity rate of HCV is high, 
reaching 85% in some populations, and the risk of progression to advanced liver
disease is as high as 20% within twenty years of infection. Host factors like
alcohol use accelerate the rate of progression. The enzyme immunoassay is the
preferred initial test for diagnosis; the third generation assay has greater than
a 99% specificity in immunocompetent patients. Barring contraindications, the
standard of care for treatment of chronic HCV has become pegylated interferon and
ribavirin. With this therapy, the cure rate for treatment-na√Øve patients is about
55%, but rates are higher in certain groups. Common side effects of therapy
include neuropsychiatric symptoms, influenza-like symptoms and hematological
abnormalities.
