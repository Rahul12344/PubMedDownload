A screening for inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) among
various types of isopolyoxomolybdates and heteropolyoxomolybdates was carried out
by using an in vitro assay system measuring the cytopathogenicity of HIV-1 in
CD4+ human MT-4 cells. A novel heteropolyoxomolybdate named PM-104 with the
chemical formula (NH4)12H2(Eu4(MoO4)(H2O)16(Mo7O24)4).13H2O was found to be
associated with potent anti-HIV-1 activity. PM-104 interferes with virus
infection at a very early step such as adsorption and/or penetration into the
cells. In addition to the cytopathic effect of HIV-1 on MT-4 cells, syncytium
formation between mock-infected MOLT-4 cells and MOLT-4 cells chronically
infected with either HIV-1 or HIV-2 is suppressed by PM-104. PM-104 also blocks
the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2). The
antiviral properties of PM-104 could be attributed to the combined effect of
europium atoms and its peculiar three-dimensional anion structure.
