We describe three strains of transgenic mice derived by embryo microinjection of 
DNA consisting of a long terminal repeat (LTR) of Moloney murine sarcoma virus
(Mo-MSV) linked to the murine c-mos coding sequences. Southern analysis of the
genomic DNA of these strains suggested that in each case the transgene had
integrated at a different chromosomal location. The strains were characterized by
dominant changes in secondary lens fiber differentiation. Shortly after birth,
insufficient elongation of differentiating lens fibers and lack of basement
membrane secretion resulted in breakdown of the posterior lens capsule. This, in 
turn led to posterior protrusion and swelling of lens tissue. In the course of
the first 3 weeks after birth, globular lens cells began to fill the entire
anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Concomitantly, there was massive
overexpression of c-mos RNA in the lens. Whereas this construct has high
transforming activity when transfected into NIH-3T3 cells, no hyperplasia or
neoplasia have been observed in the affected lenses. Increased expression of
c-mos RNA was not confined to the lens of the eye but has been detected in any of
several tissues tested.
