Interventions to enhance the quality-of-life and health of persons with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease are becoming increasingly important as the
number of people with HIV increases and as medical treatment regimens extend
their life expectancy. Behavioral medicine approaches carry considerable promise 
for the treatment of disorders associated with HIV disease, including HIV-related
nutritional disorders, pain management, sleep disorders, and treatment adherence.
This article summarizes the literature on the prevalence of these disorders in
HIV disease, reviews established behavioral medicine interventions for the
disorders, and discusses how behavioral medicine interventions might be applied
to the HIV manifestation of the disorders. Efforts to apply behavioral medicine
approaches to improve life quality, alleviate sequelae of illness, and improve
health outcomes in persons with HIV disease are urgently needed.
