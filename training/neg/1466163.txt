The method of mathematical simulation of the processes of HIV infection in
hospitals and clinics is proposed with the aim of predicting the spread of HIV
infection throughout the territory of this country. An original mathematical
model reproducing, on the whole, the essential properties of HIV infection
processes in the course of medical interventions requiring skin punctures has
been worked out. An adequate mathematical and computer model imitating the
process of HIV infection in a hospital is a convenient instrument for making up
prognostic evaluation and for the epidemiological analysis of cases of HIV
infection occurring at medical institutions throughout this country.
