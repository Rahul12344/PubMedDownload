Philip Gregory pioneered aerobiology as a topic for research, drawing together
inputs from many disciplines to contribute to better understanding of fungal
spore dispersal, plant disease epidemiology, and allergy. In childhood, he was
interested in natural history and meteorology and frequently suffered from
asthma. Initially, he worked with dermatophytes in Winnipeg, where he was
influenced by Buller. Returning to Britain, he investigated the epidemiology
first of flower bulb diseases and then of potato virus diseases, noting the
occurrence of disease gradients in crops. He developed theories of spore
dispersal during wartime air-raid duties and published these in his classic paper
of 1945. The remainder of his career was largely spent obtaining data in support 
of his theories of spore dispersal and disease gradients, on understanding splash
dispersal, in identifying the cause of farmer's lung disease, and in his
retirement, in elucidating the epidemiology of black pod disease of cocoa in
Nigeria.
