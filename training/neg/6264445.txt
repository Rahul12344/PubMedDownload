Linkage of the four gamma subclass heavy chain genes.

Roeder W, Maki R, Traunecker A, Tonegawa S.

The genes for the heavy-chain constant regions of the four gamma subclass
immunoglobulins were identified in a set of overlapping mouse DNA fragments
representing about 100 kilobase pairs (kb) of the mouse genome that was cloned
from bacteriophage lambda libraries of BALB/c mouse embryo DNA. R-loop mapping
studies show that the genes are located 5'-C gamma 3-34 kb-C gamma 1-21 kb-C
gamma 2b-15 kb-C gamma 2a-3' and lie in the same transcriptional orientation. Two
DNA segments, one of 19 kb and another of 15 kb, that surround the C gamma 2b and
C gamma 2a genes, respectively, show considerable homology and implicate a tandem
duplication mechanism in the evolution of this gene cluster.
