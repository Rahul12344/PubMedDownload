Long-term care facility environments and the vulnerability of their residents
provide a setting conducive to the rapid spread of influenza virus and other
respiratory pathogens. Infections may be introduced by staff, visitors or new or 
transferred residents, and outbreaks of influenza in such settings can have
devastating consequences for individuals, as well as placing extra strain on
health services. As the population ages over the coming decades, increased
provision of such facilities seems likely. The need for robust infection
prevention and control practices will therefore remain of paramount importance if
the impact of outbreaks is to be minimised. In this review, we discuss the nature
of the problem of influenza in long-term care facilities, and approaches to
preventive and control measures, including vaccination of residents and staff,
and the use of antiviral drugs for treatment and prophylaxis, based on currently 
available evidence.
