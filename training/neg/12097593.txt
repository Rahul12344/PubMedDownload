Dendritic cells (DC) support human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
transmission by capture of the virus particle in the mucosa and subsequent
transport to the draining lymph node, where HIV-1 is presented to CD4(+) Th
cells. Virus transmission involves a high-affinity interaction between the
DC-specific surface molecule DC-SIGN and the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120
and subsequent internalization of the virus, which remains infectious. The
mechanism of viral transmission from DC to T cells is currently unknown. Sentinel
immature DC (iDC) develop into Th1-promoting effector DC1 or Th2-promoting DC2,
depending on the activation signals. We studied the ability of these effector DC 
subsets to support HIV-1 transmission in vitro. Compared with iDC, virus
transmission is greatly upregulated for the DC1 subset, whereas DC2 cells are
inactive. Increased transmission by DC1 correlates with increased expression of
ICAM-1, and blocking studies confirm that ICAM-1 expression on DC is important
for HIV transmission. The ICAM-1-LFA-1 interaction is known to be important for
immunological cross talk between DC and T cells, and our results indicate that
this cell-cell contact is exploited by HIV-1 for efficient transmission.
