Resting CD4+ T-cells harboring inducible HIV proviruses are a critical reservoir 
in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-treated subjects. These cells express little to
no viral protein, and thus neither die by viral cytopathic effects, nor are
efficiently cleared by immune effectors. Elimination of this reservoir is
theoretically possible by combining latency-reversing agents (LRAs) with immune
effectors, such as CD8+ T-cells. However, the relative efficacy of different LRAs
in sensitizing latently-infected cells for recognition by HIV-specific CD8+
T-cells has not been determined. To address this, we developed an assay that
utilizes HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell clones as biosensors for HIV antigen
expression. By testing multiple CD8+ T-cell clones against a primary cell model
of HIV latency, we identified several single agents that primed latently-infected
cells for CD8+ T-cell recognition, including IL-2, IL-15, two IL-15 superagonists
(IL-15SA and ALT-803), prostratin, and the TLR-2 ligand Pam3CSK4. In contrast, we
did not observe CD8+ T-cell recognition of target cells following treatment with 
histone deacetylase inhibitors or with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In
further experiments we demonstrate that a clinically achievable concentration of 
the IL-15 superagonist 'ALT-803', an agent presently in clinical trials for solid
and hematological tumors, primes the natural ex vivo reservoir for CD8+ T-cell
recognition. Thus, our results establish a novel experimental approach for
comparative evaluation of LRAs, and highlight ALT-803 as an LRA with the
potential to synergize with CD8+ T-cells in HIV eradication strategies.
