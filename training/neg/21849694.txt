Human adenovirus C (HAdV-C) species are a common cause of respiratory infections 
and can occasionally produce severe clinical manifestations. A deeper
understanding of the variation and evolution in species HAdV-C is especially
important since these viruses, including HAdV-C6, are used as gene delivery
vectors for human gene therapy and in other biotechnological applications. Here, 
the full-genome analysis of the prototype HAdV-C6 and a recently identified virus
provisionally termed HAdV-C57 are reported. Although the genomes of all species
HAdV-C members are very similar to each other, the E3 region, hexon and fiber
(ten proteins total) present a wide range of identity values at the amino acid
level. Studies of these viruses in comparison to the other three HAdV-C
prototypes (1, 2, and 5) comprise a comprehensive analysis of the diversity and
conservation within HAdV-C species. HAdV-C6 contains a recombination event within
the constant region of the hexon gene. HAdV-C57 is a recombinant virus with a
fiber gene nearly identical to HAdV-C6 and a unique hexon distinguished by its
loop 2 motif.
