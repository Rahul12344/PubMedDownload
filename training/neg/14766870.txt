Bordetella pertussis was diagnosed in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected
patient by a newly developed method in which bacterial DNA is amplified directly 
from sputum Gram-stained slides. The validation of the method is described along 
with an additional new PCR-based assay that can distinguish between B. pertussis 
and Bordetella holmesii.
