Cerebellar disorders associated with HIV infection are typically the result of
discrete cerebellar lesions resulting from opportunistic infections such as
toxoplasmosis and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or primary CNS
lymphoma. Clinical symptoms and pathologic abnormalities related to the
cerebellum may also be observed with HIV dementia. A primary cerebellar
degeneration with HIV has not previously been reported. Ten patients were
identified over an 8-year period at five medical centers. All patients had
clinical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluations, and three had neuropathologic
examinations. Patients presented with progressively unsteady gait, slurred
speech, and limb clumsiness. Examination revealed gait ataxia, impaired limb
coordination, dysarthria, and abnormal eye movements. Cognition, strength, and
sensory function remained normal. CD4 lymphocyte counts varied between 10 and 437
cells/mm3. Neuroimaging studies showed prominent cerebellar atrophy.
Neuropathology showed focal degeneration of the cerebellar granular cell layer
and unusual focal axonal swellings in the brainstem and spinal cord. Cultures,
histopathology, and immunochemical studies showed no conclusive evidence of
infection. We report a syndrome of unexplained degeneration of the cerebellum
occurring in association with HIV infection.
