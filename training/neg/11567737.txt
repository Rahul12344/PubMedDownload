Recent technological advances have revolutionised our capacity to induce
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses with a variety of vaccine formulations and
delivery systems. However, the conditions required for a CTL-inducing vaccine to 
provide protection from infection or disease are poorly understood, and the
results of challenge experiments have not been consistent. Here we use a
mathematical model to examine the requirements necessary for successful
vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through cellular immunity.
We describe the interaction between cytotoxic T cells and infected lymphocytes,
capturing the essence of a persistent infection of immune cells. We conclude that
to protect from infection, the cellular immune response should be boosted to
levels exceeding those in chronic infection. This requires either that effector
CTL exceed this threshold before infection, or that a memory CTL population is
established that can yield this level of effector CTL very quickly upon
infection.
