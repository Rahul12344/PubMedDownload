[Comparative protein chemistry studies on Factor VIII concentrates].

[Article in German]

Kienast K, Trobisch H.

Large amounts of Factor VIII concentrates are required for the treatment of
haemophiliacs. Two batches each of nine commercial preparations were examined for
their in vitro properties. The parameters studied were Factor VIII coagulation
activity (F VIII: C), ristocetin cofactor activity (F VIII R: CoF), the Factor
VIII antigen content (F VIII R: Ag), fibrinogen, fibronectin and immunoglobulins.
The preparations were also tested to determine their hepatitis A and B marker
content. In none of the investigated concentrates compared to the data given by
the manufacturers was a marked F VIII: C deficit. All the preparations showed
higher values for F VIII R: Ag than for F VIII: C. Factor VIII concentrate HS was
the only concentrate in which the fibrinogen concentration was below the
detection limit and only small amounts of fibronectin and immunoglobulins were
detected. In two of the nine preparations tested possible contamination with
hepatitis B viruses was more or less ruled out by means of hepatitis serology.
