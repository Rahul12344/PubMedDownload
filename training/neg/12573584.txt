The effect of thymidine kinase (TK) encoded by herpes simplex virus type 1(HSV-1)
strain KOS in DNA replication fidelity was examined by two different mutagenesis 
assays. Mutagenesis assay of the LacZ reporter gene present in recombinant
tkLTRZ1, which contained the integrated LacZ gene in the tk locus, revealed a
less than 0.05% mutation frequency of the LacZ gene regardless of whether the
viruses were propagated in TK-expressing cells or control cells, conflicting an
earlier report that a HSV-1 TK(+) strain replicated a 0.5% mutation frequency of 
the LacZ gene (R. B. Pyles and R. L. Thompson, 1994, J. Virol. 68, 4514-4524).
Furthermore, TK-proficient and -deficient recombinant viruses replicated with
similar mutation frequencies (0.027 and 0.026%, respectively) of the LacZ gene,
which was integrated in the polymerase locus. Results of SupF mutagenesis assay
demonstrated that neither the spectra of mutation nor the mutation frequencies of
SupF gene, which was integrated in the tk locus of recombinant, were
significantly different (P > 0.05) in progeny viruses grown in TK-expressing
cells and control cells. Therefore, both LacZ and SupF mutagenesis assays
demonstrated that TK of the HSV-1 strain KOS did not have detectable mutator
activity.
