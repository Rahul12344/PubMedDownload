disease. Impairment by infectious virus of effector T cells which mediate the
response to contactant.

The paramyxovirus of Newcastle disease (NDV) impairs the contact sensitivity to
oxazolone in CBA/J mice: in vitro treatment with the infectious virus inhibits
the passive transfer of contact sensitivity. Experiments performed with three
different virus preparations demonstrate that only the infectious virus is able
to inhibit the hypersensitivity reaction while treatment of virus by heat or
ultraviolet irradiation wipes out its inhibitory activity. These results suggest 
that I-NDV depresses the response to oxazolone by its action on T immunoblasts
which mediate the response to contactant.
