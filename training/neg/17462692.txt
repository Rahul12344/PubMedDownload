A myristate linked to the N-terminus of the large hepatitis B virus (HBV)
envelope protein was found to be required for infectivity of the hepatitis delta 
virus (HDV). Myristoylation of the large HBV envelope protein being known as
indispensable for HBV infectivity, this result further demonstrates the
similarities between the HBV and HDV entry pathways. In addition, the transfer of
the N-myristoylation signal from the large to the middle or the small HBV
envelope protein led in both cases to a loss of HDV infectivity. Hence, it is
suggested that viral entry could depend on a physical link, or a spatial
association, between the N-terminal receptor-binding polypeptide of the large
protein and the myristoyl anchor linked to glycine-2.
