The main approaches are defined to the production of sera with the required
concentration of antibodies to HIV by the dilution method and to formation on
their basis of serum panels according to theoretical distribution of optic
density (OD) values. It was shown to be principally possible to prepare panels of
positive sera with low concentration of HIV-specific antibodies in a dry stable
form, and their practical importance in the evaluation of the sensitivity of
enzyme immunoassays was demonstrated. The evaluation of the quality of commercial
test systems is based on the position and shape of the histogram of OD values
distribution for panel sera for the controlled test systems.
