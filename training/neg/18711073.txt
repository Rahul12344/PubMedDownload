OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) in lesional
skin of German patients with large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) or mycosis
fungoides (MF). The pathogenetic relevance of HHV-8 in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
is controversial. Recently, a highly significant association of HHV-8 in LPP was 
found, which suggests a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.
DESIGN: Retrospective study of the presence of HHV-8 in German patients with
lymphoproliferative diseases.
SETTING: Dermatologic clinic at a university hospital of the Ruhr University
Bochum, Bochum, Germany.
PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients treated for lymphoproliferative skin diseases were
included in the study, including 14 patients with LPP, 31 with different stages
of MF, and 8 with lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP). Twenty-three patients with Kaposi
sarcoma (KS) made up the positive control group, and 10 patients with atopic
dermatitis served as negative controls.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of HHV-8 was analyzed from paraffin-embedded 
lesional tissue samples using a nested polymerase chain reaction for the open
reading frame (ORF) 26 and with immunohistochemical staining for the
latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by ORF 73.
RESULTS: A high association of HHV-8 infection in both lymphoproliferative skin
diseases was observed: 87% of LPP and 70% of MF tissue samples tested positive
for HHV-8 DNA from ORF 26. However, HHV-8 was not detectable in LPP and MF by
using the immunohistochemical marker LANA.
CONCLUSIONS: A virus unambiguously associated with KS, HHV-8 was frequently
detected at low amounts in LPP and MF specimens. However, based on the methods of
HHV-8 detection used in this study, no conclusion can be drawn on the etiologic
and pathogenetic role of HHV-8 in these diseases.
