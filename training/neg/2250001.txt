The gene 32 protein of the bacteriophage T4 is required for efficient genetic
recombination in infected Eschericia coli cells and strongly stimulates in vitro 
pairing catalyzed by the phage uvsX protein, a RecA-like strand transferase. This
helix-destabilizing factor is known to bind tightly and cooperatively to
single-stranded DNA and to interact specifically with the uvsX protein as well as
other phage gene products. However, its detailed role in homologous pairing is
not well understood. I show here that when the efficiency of uvsX
protein-mediated pairing is examined at different gene 32 protein and duplex DNA 
concentrations, a correlation between the two is found, suggesting that the two
interact in a functionally important manner during the reaction. These and other 
data are consistent with a model in which the gene 32 protein binds to the strand
displaced from the recipient duplex during pairing, thereby stabilizing the
heteroduplex product. An alternative model in which the gene 32 protein replaces 
UvsX on the invading strand, thereby freeing the strand transferase to bind to
the displaced strand, is also considered.
