Gastric cancer (GC) is a major world-wide health problem. It is the third leading
cause of death from cancer. The treatment of advanced GC by chemotherapy has
limited efficacy. The addition of some targeted therapies like trastuzumab and
ramucirumab have added a modest benefit, but only in human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (ERBB2 or HER2)-positive patients and in the second-line
setting, respectively. The development of new and effective therapeutic
strategies must consider the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of GC;
prognostic and predictive biomarkers should be identified for clinical
implementation. Immune deregulation has been associated with some GC subtypes,
especially those that are associated with virus infection and those with a high
mutational rate. Different mechanisms to prevent immunologic escape have been
characterized during the last years; in particular the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
pembrolizumab, avelumab, durvalumab and atezolizumab have shown early sign of
efficacy. Therefore, immunotherapeutic strategies may provide new opportunities
for GC patients. This review will discuss (1) the main characteristics of GC
treatment, (2) the immune response in GC, and (3) the current status of
immune-related strategies in clinical development in GC patients, focusing on
immune checkpoints therapies.
