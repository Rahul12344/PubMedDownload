The human pathogenic parvovirus B19 cannot be grown in standard tissue culture
but propagates in human bone marrow, where it is cytotoxic to erythroid
progenitor cells. We now show that parvovirus B19 can replicate in cynomolgus
bone marrow. Cynomolgus monkeys may be a suitable animal model for pathogenesis
studies of parvovirus B19.
