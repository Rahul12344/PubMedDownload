Dengue is a growing threat worldwide, and the development of a vaccine is a
public health priority. The completion of the active phase of two pivotal
efficacy studies conducted in Asia and Latin America by Sanofi Pasteur has
constituted an important step. Several other approaches are under development,
and whichever technology is used, vaccine developers face several challenges
linked to the particular nature and etiology of dengue disease. We start our
review by defining questions and potential issues linked to dengue pathology and 
presenting the main types of vaccine approaches that have explored these
questions; some of these candidates are in a late stage of clinical development. 
In the second part of the review, we focus on the Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine
candidate, describing the steps from research to phase III efficacy studies.
Finally, we discuss what could be the next steps, before and after vaccine
introduction, to ensure that the vaccine will provide the best benefit with an
acceptable safety profile to the identified target populations.
