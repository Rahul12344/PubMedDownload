BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
co-infection have worse TB treatment outcomes compared to patients with TB alone.
The distribution of unfavourable treatment outcomes differs by socio-demographic 
and clinical characteristics, allowing for early identification of patients at
risk.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a statistical model that can provide individual
probabilities of unfavourable outcomes based on demographic and clinical
characteristics of TB-HIV co-infected patients.
METHODOLOGY: We used data from all TB patients with known HIV-positive test
results (aged ≥15 years) registered for first-line anti-TB treatment (ATT) in
2015 under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) in Delhi, India. We 
included variables on demographics and pre-treatment clinical characteristics
routinely recorded and reported to RNTCP and the National AIDS Control
Organization. Binomial logistic regression was used to develop a statistical
model to estimate probabilities of unfavourable TB treatment outcomes (i.e.,
death, loss to follow-up, treatment failure, transfer out of program, and a
switch to drug-resistant regimen).
RESULTS: Of 55,260 TB patients registered for ATT in 2015 in Delhi, 928 (2%) had 
known HIV-positive test results. Of these, 816 (88%) had drug-sensitive TB and
were ≥15 years. Among 816 TB-HIV patients included, 157 (19%) had unfavourable TB
treatment outcomes. We developed a model for predicting unfavourable outcomes
using age, sex, disease classification (pulmonary versus extra-pulmonary), TB
treatment category (new or previously treated case), sputum smear grade, known
HIV status at TB diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment at TB diagnosis, and CD4
cell count at ATT initiation. The chi-square p-value for model calibration
assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.15. The model discrimination,
measured as the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, was 
0.78.
CONCLUSION: The model had good internal validity, but should be validated with an
independent cohort of TB-HIV co-infected patients to assess its performance
before clinical or programmatic use.
