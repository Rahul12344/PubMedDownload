Background. Herd immunity describes the collective immunocompetence of a
population and its ability to resist disease. The diseases of mycobacteria,
salmonella, hepatitis A, cryptosporidia, syphilis, measles, influenza, and
numerous others recently have been seen in epidemic proportions in the United
States. An association between these superimposed secondary infections and the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic can be made since the HIV's
imposition on individual immunity has ramifications on a population level through
a decline in herd immunity. Conclusion. Exploring these epidemic phenomena as
consequential to a reduction in herd immunity can provide a unifying hypothesis
to explain existing and predict future infectious disease epidemic dynamics. The 
benefits of acting upon these implications has advantages for both the HIV
infected and the uninfected.
