A viral gene, CpBV-CST1, was identified from a polydnavirus Cotesia plutellae
bracovirus (CpBV). Its protein product was significantly toxic to lepidopteran
insects. This study generated a transgenic tobacco plant expressing CpBV-CST1
Expression of transgene CpBV-CST1 was confirmed in T1 generation (second
generation after transgenesis) in both mRNA and protein levels. Young larvae of
Spodoptera exigua (Hübner) suffered high mortalities after feeding on transgenic 
tobacco. All 10 T1 transgenic tobacco plants had no significant variation in
speed-to-kill. In order to further explore insect resistance of these transgenic 
tobaccos, bioassays were performed by assessing antixenosis and antibiosis. S.
exigua larvae significantly avoided T1 plants in a choice test. Larvae fed with
T1 plant exhibited significant decrease in protease activity in the midgut due to
consuming CpBV-CST1 protein produced by the transgenic plant. Furthermore, the
transgenic tobacco exhibited similar insect resistance to other tobacco-infesting
insects, including a leaf-feeding insect, Helicoverpa assulta, and a sap-feeding 
insect, Myzus persicae These results demonstrate that a viral cystatin gene can
be used to develop insect-resistant transgenic plant, suggesting a prospective
possibility of expanding the current transgenic approach to high-valued crops.
