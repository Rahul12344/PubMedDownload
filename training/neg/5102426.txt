Modification of Sindbis virus glycoprotein by host-specified glycosyl
transferases.

Grimes WJ, Burge BW.

The amino acid sequence of the membrane glycoprotein of Sindbis virus is
specified by the viral genome, but it has not been determined whether the
carbohydrate portion of this molecule is specified by the cell or by the virus.
We have examined two of the enzyme activities which catalyze transfer of
monosaccharides to glycoprotein (sialyl and fucosyl transferases). Comparison of 
particulate enzyme preparations from infected and uninfected cells showed no
difference in either the specific activity or acceptor specificity of these
enzymes. This is impressive in view of the fact that the Sindbis membrane
glycoprotein is the only glycoprotein synthesized in the infected cell. It was
also determined that sialyl transferase from uninfected cells is capable of
transferring ((3)H) sialic acid to acceptor prepared from Sindbis membrane
glycoprotein. These results imply that at least some of the carbohydrate of the
virus glycoprotein can arise by host modification.
