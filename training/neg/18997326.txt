This paper reports the crystallization and preliminary neutron diffraction
measurements of HIV-1 protease, a potential target for anti-HIV therapy,
complexed with an inhibitor (KNI-272). The aim of this neutron diffraction study 
is to obtain structural information about the H atoms and to determine the
protonation states of the residues within the active site. The crystal was grown 
to a size of 1.4 mm(3) by repeated macroseeding and a slow-cooling method using a
two-liquid system. Neutron diffraction data were collected at room temperature
using a BIX-4 diffractometer at the JRR-3 research reactor of the Japan Atomic
Energy Agency (JAEA). The data set was integrated and scaled to 2.3 A resolution 
in space group P2(1)2(1)2, with unit-cell parameters a = 59.5, b = 87.4, c = 46.8
A.
