Moroccan pepper virus (MPV) and Lettuce necrotic stunt virus (LNSV) have been
steadily increasing in prevalence in central Asia and western North America,
respectively, over the past decade. Recent sequence analysis of LNSV demonstrated
a close relationship between the coat proteins of LNSV and MPV. To determine the 
full extent of the relationship between LNSV and MPV, the genomes of three MPV
isolates were sequenced and compared with that of LNSV. Sequence analysis
demonstrated that genomic nucleotide sequences as well as virus-encoded proteins 
of the three MPV isolates and LNSV shared 97% or greater identity. A full-length 
clone of a California LNSV isolate was developed and virus derived from
infectious transcripts was used to evaluate host plant reactions under controlled
conditions. Symptoms of LNSV matched those described previously for MPV on most
of a select series of host plants, although some differences were observed.
Collectively, these molecular and biological results demonstrate that LNSV should
be classified as MPV within the family Tombusviridae, genus Tombusvirus, and
confirm the presence of MPV in North America.
