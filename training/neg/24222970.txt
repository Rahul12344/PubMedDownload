Manuscript of Carrera et al is devoted to immunization in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD) that is very important issue in gastroenterology. However, some
specific definitions used in the article need clarification. Efficacy of vaccine 
is measured in a randomised, placebo-controlled studies, that are expensive and
difficult to plan. Moreover, it is unethical to offer a placebo instead of
vaccine. For all of these reasons, efficacy of vaccine is measured in IBD
patients rarely. Effectiveness of vaccine is measured as an epidemiological
affect from observational studies. These studies are also uncommon in IBD because
it would be difficult to perform a study that assess the prevalence of one rare
disease (vaccine-preventable) in patients with a chronic rare condition, such as 
IBD. Immunogenicity of vaccine refers to the ability of a vaccine to induce an
immune response in a vaccinated individual that is, in fact, the matter of the
article.
