OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of varying dosing schedules and predictor
variables on the seroprotection rates and geometric mean titer levels resulting
from the hepatitis B vaccination series among adolescents.
METHODS: Adolescents received the hepatitis B vaccination series at varying
schedules according to their natural adherence patterns. Data collected included 
participants' medication use; chronic illness; use of cigarettes, alcohol, and
marijuana; age; race/ethnicity; and body mass index. Participants' dates of
vaccinations were recorded and titer levels for hepatitis B surface antibody were
drawn ~12 and 24 months after study enrollment. The data for 498 participants
were analyzed using chi(2) tests, Student t tests, logistic regression models,
and analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Seroprotection rates among adolescents were not affected by late
vaccinations. The only factors affecting the achievement of seroprotection ~12
and 24 months after the first vaccination were body mass index and the number of 
immunizations received. Increased time between doses 1 and 2 and doses 2 and 3
showed a trend toward correlating with increasing titer levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Although adolescents at risk of acquiring hepatitis B should receive
the hepatitis B vaccination series in a timely fashion, late doses are not
detrimental, and may be beneficial, to achieving high antibody levels against the
hepatitis B virus.
