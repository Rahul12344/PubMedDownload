The present study found that the supercritical fluid extract of "Guangchenpi"
possessed in vitro antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). 
Bioassay-guided isolation and identification of this extract led to obtain five
active polymethoxylated flavones (1-5). Cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay
exhibited that tangeretin (2) and nobiletin (3), two major polymethoxylated
flavones in the extract, possessed better anti-RSV effect comparable to the
positive control ribavirin. Plaque reduction assay revealed that tangeretin
dose-dependently inhibited RSV-induced plaque formation on the HEp-2 cells. This 
polymethoxylated flavone mainly affected the intracellular replication of RSV,
and it also could inhibit RSV entry into the HEp-2 cells. Further investigations 
with quantitative real-time PCR and confocal and Western blot assays indicated
that tangeretin downregulated the expression of RSV phosphoprotein (P protein).
Results suggest the potential application of the supercritical fluid extract of
"Guangchenpi" and tangeretin in the treatment and the prevention of RSV
infection.
