Recently, we demonstrated that direct inoculation of a hemagglutinin 7
(H7)-expressing DNA could vaccinate chickens against a lethal H7 influenza virus 
challenge. These experiments used a defective-retroviral-based vector to express 
H7 (p188) (Robinson et al., 1993). Here, we report protective immunizations using
a non-retroviral-based vector for H7 expression (pCMV/H7). Unlike the previously 
used retroviral-based vector, this vector cannot be transmitted as an infectious 
agent (as a consequence of phenotypic mixing with exogenous or endogenous virus
proteins). Vaccination was accomplished by inoculating young, immunocompetent
chickens by each of three routes (intravenous, intraperitoneal, and
intramuscular) with 100 micrograms of cesium chloride-purified pCMV/H7 DNA in
saline. After two immunizations, birds were challenged via the nares with a
lethal dose of a highly virulent chicken influenza virus of the H7 subtype. The
results of five independent vaccine trials demonstrated protective immunizations 
in approximately 60% of the pCMV/H7 DNA-inoculated chickens. By contrast, only 3%
of the chickens inoculated with control DNA survived the lethal challenge.
