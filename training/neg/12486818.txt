Using our experimental model we demonstrate the need for Th1 immune responses for
recovery from influenza virus infection. Inoculation of IL-4 concurrent with
infection significantly delays virus clearance and converts the immune response
to a Th2 response. Immunization using live virus in the presence of IL-4 leads to
generation of Th2 memory cells that fail to facilitate recovery upon subsequent
virus infection. Inactivated virus expands Th2 cells, leading to responses
similar to those observed following IL-4 infusion. Immunization using cultured
dendritic cells incubated with live or inactivated virus mimics the results
observed with direct virus injection. We demonstrate that in contrast to live
virus-infected dendritic cells, inactivated virus fails to elicit Th1 immunity.
This failure correlates with the inactivated viruses' inability to induce
dendritic cell maturation. Thus, our data suggest that the polarity of the immune
response is dictated by the nature of the antigen, and the trigger for influenza 
virus-induced DC maturation leading to Th1 immunity is dependent on virus
replication.
