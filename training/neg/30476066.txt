Background: Poxviruses are large DNA viruses that infect humans and animals.
Vaccinia virus (VACV) has been applied as a live vaccine for immunization against
smallpox, which was eradicated by 1980 as a result of worldwide vaccination. VACV
is the prototype of poxviruses in the investigation of the molecular pathogenesis
of the virus. Short-read sequencing methods have revolutionized transcriptomics; 
however, they are not efficient in distinguishing between the RNA isoforms and
transcript overlaps. Long-read sequencing (LRS) is much better suited to solve
these problems and also allow direct RNA sequencing. Despite the scientific
relevance of VACV, no LRS data have been generated for the viral transcriptome to
date.
Findings: For the deep characterization of the VACV RNA profile, various LRS
platforms and library preparation approaches were applied. The raw reads were
mapped to the VACV reference genome and also to the host (Chlorocebus sabaeus)
genome. In this study, we applied the Pacific Biosciences RSII and Sequel
platforms, which altogether resulted in 937,531 mapped reads of inserts (1.42
Gb), while we obtained 2,160,348 aligned reads (1.75 Gb) from the different
library preparation methods using the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore
Technologies.
Conclusions: By applying cutting-edge technologies, we were able to generate a
large dataset that can serve as a valuable resource for the investigation of the 
dynamic VACV transcriptome, the virus-host interactions, and RNA base
modifications. These data can provide useful information for novel gene
annotations in the VACV genome. Our dataset can also be used to analyze the
currently available LRS platforms, library preparation methods, and
bioinformatics pipelines.
