Some bovine enteric caliciviruses form a new genus in the family Caliciviridae.
In this study, Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 31 full length capsid sequences 
from Europe, North America and Asia revealed that this new genus had four
currently circulating lineages that showed both temporal and geographical
distribution. These groupings were supported by the distribution of the frequency
of pair-wise distances. However, the nucleotide and amino acid heterogeneity was 
low, with a maximum nucleotide and amino acid divergence of 16.7% and 8.4%,
respectively. Most variability was found between amino acid residues 288 and 420 
of the capsid protein and the sequence motifs observed in this region supported
the division of the four lineages. Homology modelling using the structure of the 
San Miguel sea lion capsid indicated that most variation occurred in the
predicted P2 domain and thus, may affect antigenic sites on the surface of the
capsid of this newly described genus.
