INTRODUCTION: The Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by combination of herpes 
infection and lower motor neuron type of facial nerve palsy. The disease is
caused by a reactivation of Varicella Zoster virus and can be unrepresentative
since the herpetic lesions may not be always be present (zoster sine herpete) and
might mimic other severe neurological illnesses.
CASE REPORT: A 63-year-old man known case of carcinoma of gall bladder with liver
metastases, post surgery and chemotherapy with no scope for further disease
modifying treatment, was referred to palliative care unit for best supportive
care. He was on regular analgesics and other supportive treatment. He presented
to Palliative Medicine outpatient with 3 days history of ipsilateral facial pain 
of neuropathic character, otalgia, diffuse vesciculo-papular rash over ophthalmic
and maxillary divisions of left trigeminal nerve distribution of face and ear,
and was associated with secondary bacterial infection and unilateral facial
edema. He was clinically diagnosed to have Herpes Zoster with superadded
bacterial infection. He was treated with tablet Valacyclovir 500 mg four times a 
day, Acyclovir cream for local application, Acyclovir eye ointment for
prophylactic treatment of Herpetic Keratitis, low dose of Prednisolone, oral
Amoxicillin and Clindamycin for 7 days, and Pregabalin 150 mg per day. After 7
days of treatment, the rash and vesicles had completely resolved and good
improvement of pain and other symptoms were noted.
CONCLUSION: Management of acute infections and its associated complications in an
acute palliative care setting improves both quality and length of life.
