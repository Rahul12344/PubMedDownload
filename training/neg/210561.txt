Clinical, virological, morphological, and immunofluorescence investigations were 
carried out on 22 pigs experimentally infected with two strains--a virulent one
(V) of a 10(-3) titer, and a slightly virulent one (K) of a 10(-7) titer--of the 
virus of Aujeszky's disease as well as on contact pigs. Results revealed
variations in the clinical and morphological manifestation of the disease in the 
individual groups. They were shown to be due to the strains of the virus that
varied in virulence and tissue tropism. In the strain B-infected animals there
were clinical symptoms characteristic of the disease, and the morphological
changes in the central nervous system were of the nonsuppurative encephalitis
type. The pigs infected with the K strain of the virus showed no clinical
symptoms, while the contact animals manifested only respiratory troubles as well 
as interstitial pneumonia. It was demonstrated that the strains of slight
virulence had weak nervotropic and pronounced pneumotropic characters. Complex
virologic, morphologic and immunofluorescence investigations can be used for the 
diagnosis of the atypical forms of Aujeszky's disease and for the differentiation
of the virulent from the slightly virulent strains of the virus.
