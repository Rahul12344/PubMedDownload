Exon skipping has been demonstrated to be a successful strategy for the gene
therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD): the rational being to convert
severe Duchenne forms into milder Becker ones. Here, we show the selection of U1 
snRNA-antisense constructs able to confer effective rescue of dystrophin
synthesis in a Δ44 Duchenne genetic background, through skipping of exon 45;
moreover, we demonstrate that the resulting dystrophin is able to recover timing 
of myogenic marker expression, to relocalize neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS) and to rescue expression of miRNAs previously shown to be sensitive to the
Dystrophin-nNOS-HDAC2 pathway. Becker mutations display different phenotypes,
likely depending on whether the shorter protein is able to reconstitute the wide 
range of wild-type functions. Among them, efficient assembly of the
dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and nNOS localization are important.
Comparing different Becker deletions we demonstrate the correlation between the
ability of the mutant dystrophin to relocalize nNOS and the expression levels of 
two miRNAs, miR-1 and miR29c, known to be involved in muscle homeostasis and to
be controlled by the Dys-nNOS-HDAC2 pathway.
