Colorectal cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a high mortality rate;
however, effective therapies are currently lacking. Cancer-targeting
gene-virotherapy (CTGVT) has been proposed to be a promising strategy for cancer 
therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of
the oncolytic adenovirus harboring Lipocalin-2 (ZD55-Lipocalin-2, an example of
CTGVT) in colorectal cancer. ZD55-Lipocalin-2 was generated by deleting E1B55-KD 
and inserting the Lipocalin-2 gene. Its cytopathic effects and cell growth
inhibition were detected in vitro, and antitumor effects were examined in a nude 
mouse model of human colorectal cancer xenografts. Results showed that
ZD55-Lipocalin-2 significantly inhibited the colorectal cancer growth by
selective cytolysis, inducing apoptosis and decreasing the microvessel density in
tumors. The anticancer potential of ZD55-Lipocalin-2 showed stronger than that of
the isolated Lipocalin-2 gene therapy or isolated ZD55 oncolytic adenovirus
therapy. ZD55-Lipocalin-2 may serve as a potential anticancer agent for
colorectal cancer treatment.
