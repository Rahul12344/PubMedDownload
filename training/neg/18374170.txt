Mutations in regulators and effectors of the Rho GTPases underlie various forms
of mental retardation (MR). Among them, oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1), which encodes a
Rho-GTPase activating protein, was one of the first Rho-linked MR genes
identified. Upon characterization of OPHN1 in hippocampal brain slices, we
obtained evidence for the requirement of OPHN1 in dendritic spine morphogenesis
and neuronal function of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Organotypic hippocampal brain
slice cultures are commonly used as a model system to investigate the morphology 
and synaptic function of neurons, mainly because they allow for the long-term
examination of neurons in a preparation where the gross cellular architecture of 
the hippocampus is retained. In addition, maintenance of the trisynaptic
circuitry in hippocampal slices enables the study of synaptic connections. Today,
a multitude of gene transfer methods for postmitotic neurons in brain slices are 
available to easily manipulate and scrutinize the involvement of signaling
molecules, such as Rho GTPases, in specific cellular processes in this system.
This chapter covers techniques detailing the preparation and culturing of
organotypic hippocampal brain slices, as well as the production and injection of 
lentivirus into brain slices.
