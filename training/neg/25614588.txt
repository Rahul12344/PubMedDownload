IFN-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a restriction factor that blocks 
cytosolic entry of numerous viruses that utilize acidic endosomal entry pathways.
In humans and mice, IFITM3 limits influenza-induced morbidity and mortality.
Although many IFITM3-sensitive viruses are zoonotic, whether IFITMs function as
antiviral restriction factors in mammalian species other than humans and mice is 
unknown. Here, IFITM3 orthologues in the microbat (Myotis myotis) and pig (Sus
scrofa domesticus) were identified using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Amino 
acid residues known to be important for IFITM3 function were conserved in the pig
and microbat orthologues. Ectopically expressed pig and microbat IFITM3
co-localized with transferrin (early endosomes) and CD63 (late
endosomes/multivesicular bodies). Pig and microbat IFITM3 restricted cell entry
mediated by multiple influenza haemagglutinin subtypes and lyssavirus
glycoproteins. Expression of pig or microbat IFITM3 in A549 cells reduced
influenza virus yields and nucleoprotein expression. Conversely, small
interfering RNA knockdown of IFITM3 in pig NPTr cells and primary microbat cells 
enhanced virus replication, demonstrating that these genes are functional in
their species of origin at endogenous levels. In summary, we showed that IFITMs
function as potent broad-spectrum antiviral effectors in two mammals - pigs and
bats - identified as major reservoirs for emerging viruses.
