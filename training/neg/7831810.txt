Mice inoculated with replication-competent stocks of the murine acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) virus are severely immunocompromised and proned
to the development of T- and B-cell lymphomas. We have studied the development of
T-cell lymphomas in C57BL/6 and RF/J mice inoculated with helper-free stocks of
the MAIDS defective virus. We observed the expansion of T cell clones (detected
by TCR gene rearrangements and by transplantation) only rarely in diseased
C57BL/6 mice and slightly more frequently in RF/J mice. We succeeded in
establishing four transplantable T cell tumors and malignant cell lines. The
three cell lines from RF/J mice were immature T-cells (Thy-1+, CD3-, CD4+, CD8+, 
Mac-1+), while the line from the C57BL/6 mouse had the phenotype of mature
T-cells (Thy-1+, CD3+, CD4+, CD8-). All lines were virus-producers despite the
fact that helper-free stocks of the virus were inoculated. These helper MuLVs
most likely originated from endogenous MuLV sequences. Also, the defective viral 
genome was clearly detectable in one cell line and was rearranged in two other
lines. These established cell lines may be useful to determine whether they share
some of the characteristics of the anergic T-cells in vivo and to study the role 
of the MAIDS defective virus in T cell transformation.
