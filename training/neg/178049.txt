A reovirus-like agent (rotavirus) in gastroenteritis of children. Virus detection
and serological studies.

A reovirus-like agent (rotavirus) was detected in 26 children (44%) when fecal
specimens from 59 children with acute gastroenteritis were examined by electron
microscopy. No rotavirus was detected in the feces of 49 children with other
diseases. Sera from the acute and the convalescent phase from 40 children with
acute gastroenteritis and from 18 other patients were examined for antibodies
against a bovine rotavirus by an indirect fluorescent antibody test. 26 of the
patients with gastroenteritis (65%) developed antibodies during their disease,
whereas none of the other patients showed a rise in antibody titre. The specimens
were submitted to the laboratory from hospitalized children during the period
January 1973 through March 1975. Most of the cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis
occurred during late autumn and early winter among children between 0.5 and 3
years of age. It is concluded that electron microscopy is a sensitive diagnostic 
technique during the acute phase of the disease, and that the serological test
with bovine rotavirus antigen served as a useful diagnostic tool.
