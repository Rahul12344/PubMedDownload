Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in blood donors in the United States:
implications for surrogate testing programs.

Kline WE, Bowman RJ, McCurdy KK, O'Malley JP, Sandler SG.

In order to evaluate the operational implications of excluding donated blood with
antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), the American Red Cross tested
107,473 voluntary blood donations for anti-HBc in 72 test sites during a 1-week
period. The system-wide prevalence of anti-HBc was 2.60 percent, with a range of 
0.55 to 6.38 percent, depending on geographic region. For the American Red Cross,
which collects approximately one-half of the blood supply in the United States,
excluding donated blood with anti-HBc would result in a loss of approximately
159,500 units during the first year.
