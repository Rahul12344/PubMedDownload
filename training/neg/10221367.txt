Protease inhibitors (PIs) effectively inhibit replication of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and reduce mortality and prolong survival in
patients with HIV infection. Newer PIs saquinavir (soft gelatin capsule) and
amprenavir, as well as other PIs, may be effective when administered twice/day.
Adverse reactions may occur, as well as metabolic complications and interactions 
between PIs and other drugs, including other PIs. The strategy of combining PIs
is based on specific pharmacologic interactions among the agents.
