In this work, a gold complex is used as electroactive label for monitoring
hybridization assays on glassy carbon electrodes. Ionic gold is bound to a 30-mer
sequence of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, responsible for
the atypical pneumonia, using sodium aurothiomalate. In order to label this
single strand, a mixture of sodium aurothiomalate and the strand is prepared.
Then, it is incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C and, finally, free gold is
separated from the labeled strand by a dialysis against a 0.15M NaCl solution (pH
7.5). The DNA hybridization sensor is designed immobilizing the complementary
probe on the pre-treated electrode surface and, then, the hybridization reaction 
takes place with the gold labeled strand. The electrochemical determination is
based on the catalytic effect of electrodeposited gold on the reduction of silver
ions. In non-stringent experimental conditions, a limit of detection of 15 fmol
(30 microL) is obtained, and discrimination between a complementary
oligonucleotide and a three-based mismatch complementary oligonucleotide is
achieved. For the discrimination of a single-base mismatch, is needed to use
stringent conditions (50% of formamide in the hybridization buffer).
