Oncolytic viruses are a relatively new class of anti-cancer immunotherapy agents.
Several viruses have undergone evaluation in clinical trials in the last decades,
and the first agent is about to be approved to be used as a novel cancer therapy 
modality. In the current review, an overview is presented on recent (pre)clinical
developments in the field of oncolytic viruses that have previously been or
currently are being evaluated in clinical trials. Special attention is given to
possible safety issues like toxicity, environmental shedding, mutation and
reversion to wildtype virus.
