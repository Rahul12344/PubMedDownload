[Effect of chemical modifiers on the antigen-binding capacity of antibodies].

[Article in Bulgarian]

Veleva EB.

The effect was followed up of the chemical modifications "carbamylation" and
"benzylation" on the antigen-fixing activity of the foot-and-mouth disease
immunoglobulins G and M. The chemical agents used - potassium cyanate and
2-hydroxi-5-nitrobenzylbromide--modified a considerable number of side lysine
chains and tryptophane radicals, however, had no effect on the precipitation
activity of the foot-and-mouth disease antibodies IgG and IgM manifested with the
respective antigens. The lowered ability of the modified (to a higher degree)
antibodies to form precipitations with the homologous virus was due to secondary 
reactions between the two components of the system, the functional groups of the 
active center remaining intact. The higher affinity of the IgM antibody to the
homologous antigen was due to its polyvalent capacity (as compared to the
bivalent immunoglobulin G).
