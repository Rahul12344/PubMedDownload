Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and group
A Streptoccocus, but no Klebsiella pneumoniae were responsible for bacterial
coinfections during the 2009 and previous influenza pandemics. We hereby report a
case with concurrent bacteremic pneumonia due to an unusual capsular serotype K16
K. pneumoniae and pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in a patient with nasopharyngeal
cancer. Such a coinfection has not previously been described.
