Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is one of the main infectious diseases in Atlantic
salmon farming with major economical implications. Despite the strong regulatory 
interventions, the ISA epidemic is not under control, worldwide. We study the
data covering salmon farming in Norway from 2002 to 2005 and propose a stochastic
space-time model for the transmission of the virus. We model seaway transmission 
between farm sites, transmission through shared management and infrastructure,
biomass effects and other potential pathways within the farming industry. We find
that biomass has an effect on infectiousness, the local contact network and
seaway distance of 5 km represent similar risks, but a large component of risk
originates from other sources, among which are possibly infected salmon smolt and
boat traffic.
