Thirty eight paralysis cases classified as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in
Brazil were analysed. In all these cases Sabin-related poliovirus vaccine strains
were isolated. In most of the cases the last vaccine dose was given months or
years before the onset of GBS, suggesting a persistent infection or the
transmission of the Sabin-related strains to the patients. The isolation of
Sabin-related strains from GBS cases some days or weeks after the onset of the
disease, demonstrated a temporal association between the isolation of the strains
and the disease. Although the isolates from the GBS cases may not be the
etiological agent of the disease, this study strongly indicates that infections
caused by Sabin-related vaccine strains can trigger the GBS in certain cases.
