Host antibody response to toxin molecules is a major obstacle to the use of
immunotoxins as efficacious agents in the treatment of human cancer and other
diseases. In this study, a genetic form of immunotoxin has been designed which
should eliminate toxin immunogenicity by replacing the toxin protein moiety with 
weakly immunogenic or nonimmunogenic plasmid DNA. A recombinant bifunctional
fusion protein, which consists of a human antibody Fab targeting moiety [directed
against gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1]
and a human DNA binding moiety (protamine), is used as a gene carrier. Toxin
plasmid DNAs expressing the catalytic fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PEA)
statically interact with the fusion proteins to form soluble protein-DNA
complexes. The complexes are specifically transferred into HIV-1-infected cells
by receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting in selective killing of the target
cells. These 'genetic immunotoxins' may have significant advantages over protein 
immunotoxins for the treatment of a variety of human diseases.
