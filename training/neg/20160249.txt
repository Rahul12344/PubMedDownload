OBJECTIVE: Standardized case definitions have recently been proposed by the
International Network for the Study of HIV-associated immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome (INSHI; [IRIS]) for use in resource-limited settings. We
evaluated paradoxical tuberculosis (TB)-associated IRIS in a large cohort from a 
TB endemic setting with the use of these case definitions.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
METHOD: We reviewed records from 1250 South African patients who initiated
antiretroviral therapy (ART) over a 5-year period.
RESULTS: A total of 333 (27%) of the patients in the cohort had prevalent TB at
the initiation of ART. Of 54 possible paradoxical TB-associated IRIS cases, 35
fulfilled the INSHI case definitions (11% of TB cases).
CONCLUSIONS: INSHI-standardized case definitions were used successfully in
identifying paradoxical TB-associated IRIS in this cohort and resulted in a
similar proportion of TB IRIS cases (11%) as that reported in previous studies
from resource-limited settings (8%-13%). This case definition should be evaluated
prospectively.
