AIM: To first compare the accuracy of self-, Physician-HPV testing and VIA as
standalone screening tests; and second to compare the accuracy of Self-HPV
positive test triaged with VIA with the different standalone screening tests as
colposcopy and histologically confirmed CIN for cervical cancer screening in
low-resource settings
METHODS: 1,601 women in Sharkya Governerate, Egypt concurrently received HPV DNA 
testing [Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay] for self-collected and physician-obtained 
samples, and VIA. Women who tested positive for HPV DNA or VIA received
colposcopy and biopsy.
RESULTS: Percentage of women testing positive was 84.8 % on Self-HPV, 87.8 % on
Physician-HPV, and 76.8 % on VIA. Test positivity increased in all screening
methods with increasing severity of histopathologic diagnosis. Physician-HPV and 
HPV testing on a self-sample showed a very good agreement for HPV testing results
[Îº = 0.89 (95 % CI = 0.52-0.79)]; no statistically significant variation between 
age groups in the sensitivities of HPV testing on a self-sample, Physician-HPV
testing for detecting CIN2 or CIN3 lesions. Conversely, VIA sensitivity was lower
in detecting CIN2 and CIN3 than HPV testing on a self-sample and decreased
significantly in the older age groups. HPV testing on a self-sample positive
combined with VIA increases specificity to 98.1 % for CIN2 and 99.4 % for CIN3,
and decreased colposcopy referral rate to 2.5 %.
CONCLUSION: HPV testing on a self-sample is more accurate than VIA and as
accurate as clinician-HPV testing for cervical cancer in low-resource settings.
