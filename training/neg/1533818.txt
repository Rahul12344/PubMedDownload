The Neurospora CYT-18 protein, a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which functions in
splicing group I introns in mitochondria, promotes splicing of mutants of the
distantly related bacteriophage T4 td intron. In an in vivo assay, wild-type
CYT-18 protein expressed in E. coli suppressed mutations in the td intron's
catalytic core. CYT-18-suppressible mutations were also suppressed by high Mg2+
or spermidine in vitro, suggesting they affect intron structure. Both the N- and 
C-terminal domains of CYT-18 are required for efficient splicing, but CYT-18 with
a large C-terminal truncation retains some activity. Our results indicate that
CYT-18 interacts with conserved structural features of group I introns, and they 
provide direct evidence that a protein promotes splicing by stabilizing the
catalytically active structure of the intron RNA.
