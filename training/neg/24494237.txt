A cellular gene as a double surveillance agent for plant to combat pathogen.

Li B, Feng H, Zhang Q, Zhang X, Hong Y.

The tomato extreme resistance R-gene encodes Tm2/ Tm22 protein that interacts
with the tobamovirus movement protein (MP) to induce hypersensitive response (HR)
resulting in local resistance. R-gene mediated local resistance requires a
functional RbCS that interacts with MP, restricting virus local infection.
RbCS-MP interaction is also required for tobamovirus systemic infection.
“Loss-of-function” RbCS allows local but not systemic infection. Thus, RbCS, a
cellular gene, acts as a double surveillance agent to protect plant from
pathogenic attack, suggesting a previously un-recognized defense strategy in
plants.
