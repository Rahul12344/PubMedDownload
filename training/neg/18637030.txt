OBJECTIVES: Infections are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). They primarily occur during the first course 
of induction chemotherapy and may increase the risk of leukaemia relapse, due to 
a significant delay in consolidation therapy. The intensification of induction
chemotherapy and the use of non-conventional drugs such as fludarabine are
considered responsible for the increased risk of infections.
METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analysed the infections occurred in
224 newly diagnosed AML patients </=65 yr, consecutively treated between 1997 and
2002 with an induction regimen including fludarabine, arabinosyl cytosine and
idarubicin, with or without etoposide (FLAI/FLAIE), in the context of three
multicentric prospective trials (AML97, AML99, AML02).
RESULTS: During the induction phase, 146 (65%) patients experienced fever of
undetermined origin (FUO), 30 (13%) and 47 (21%) patients had Gram-negative and
positive bacteremias, respectively, and 10 (4%) patients developed a
probable/proven invasive fungal infection (IFI). The fatality rate for
Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 10%, 8% and 
60% respectively. During consolidation, 75 (35%) patients had FUO, 43 (20%) and
40 (19%) patients had Gram-negative and positive bacteremias, respectively, and 5
(2%) patients developed a probable/proven IFI. The fatality rate for
Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 14%, 5% and 
80% respectively. Interestingly, the overall incidence of microbiologically
documented infections during induction was 38% and the incidence of
probable/proven IFIs during the induction/consolidation programme was 7%. No
infections caused by viruses or opportunistic pathogens were observed neither
during induction, nor during consolidation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data, although retrospectively collected, suggest that
fludarabine-based chemotherapy is not associated with an increased incidence of
infections, in particular IFIs, compared to conventional regimens commonly used
for AML induction.
