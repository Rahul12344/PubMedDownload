BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1) has been suggested to 
play a role in the development, growth or progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Genotype and serum titer of HCV also affect the occurrence of HCC in
chronic hepatitis C. In this study, we were to evaluate the effects of genotype
or serum titer of HCV on the expression of TGF beta 1. We also intended to
examine the correlation between the up-regulation of TGF beta 1 and the
association with HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
METHODS: We studied 19 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 18 with HCC
associated with HCV infection. HCV genotype was determined by line probe reverse 
hybridization assay and the amount of HCV-RNA was quantitated by branched DNA
signal amplification assay. Serum TGF beta 1 level was measured by enzyme linked 
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: HCV genotypes of patients with HCC were similar to those without it.
Serum HCV-RNA titer was higher in genotype 1b than in non-1b (p < 0.05). Serum
TGF beta 1 levels were higher in HCC than in chronic hepatitis (p < 0.05).
However, there was no significant difference in the serum TGF beta 1 level
between genotype 1b and non-1b. Also, it was not correlated with the serum
HCV-RNA titer or alanine aminotransferase levels.
CONCLUSION: TGF beta 1 seems to be overexpressed in HCC compared to that of
chronic hepatitis C: it was not affected by serum ALT levels, genotype or serum
HCV titer. It is suggested that TGF beta 1 may be associated with the malignant
transformation of hepatocyte or the progression of HCV-associated HCC.
