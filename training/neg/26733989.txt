A key factor in the effectiveness of the seasonal influenza vaccine is its
immunological compatibility with the circulating viruses during the season. Here 
we propose a new bioinformatics approach for analysis of influenza viruses which 
could be used as an efficient tool for selection of vaccine viruses, assessment
of the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines, and prediction of the
epidemic/pandemic potential of novel influenza viruses.
