We recently reported that the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) Us3 protein kinase
phosphorylates threonine at position 887 (Thr-887) in the cytoplasmic tail of
envelope glycoprotein B (gB) (A. Kato, J. Arii, I. Shiratori, H. Akashi, H.
Arase, and Y. Kawaguchi, J. Virol. 83:250-261, 2009; T. Wisner, C. C. Wright, A. 
Kato, Y. Kawaguchi, F. Mou, J. D. Baines, R. J. Roller and D. C. Johnson, J.
Virol. 83:3115-3126, 2009). In the studies reported here, we examined the
effect(s) of this phosphorylation on viral replication and pathogenesis in vivo
and present data showing that replacement of gB Thr-887 by alanine significantly 
reduced viral replication in the mouse cornea and development of herpes stroma
keratitis and periocular skin disease in mice. The same effects have been
reported for mice infected with a recombinant HSV-1 carrying a kinase-inactive
mutant of Us3. These observations suggested that Us3 phosphorylation of gB
Thr-887 played a critical role in viral replication in vivo and in HSV-1
pathogenesis. In addition, we generated a monoclonal antibody that specifically
reacted with phosphorylated gB Thr-887 and used this antibody to show that Us3
phosphorylation of gB Thr-887 regulated subcellular localization of gB,
particularly on the cell surface of infected cells.
