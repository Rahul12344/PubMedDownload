We have generated transgenic mouse lineages that express the influenza virus
hemagglutinin in different physical forms. One kind expresses the full-length
hemagglutinin molecule as a cell surface glycoprotein and can be recognized by
hemagglutinin-specific B and T cells. The other expresses a truncated polypeptide
corresponding to the N-terminal third of the hemagglutinin molecule. This
polypeptide encodes known hemagglutinin-specific T-cell determinants; however, it
contains no native B-cell epitopes, since these depend on the conformation of the
fully folded protein. In each case, the hemagglutinin transgenic mice display
ubiquitous expression of transgenic messenger RNA and induce T-cell tolerance to 
the transgene-encoded T-cell determinant site 1. Thus, the hemagglutinin is a
neo-self-antigen in both kinds of hemagglutinin transgenic mice and should
provide a useful system for understanding the factors and mechanisms that govern 
tolerance and autoimmunity to self-antigens.
