A transcript containing the long terminal repeat (LTR) and the sequence
homologous to the KIAA1245 mRNA fragment were revealed among the transcribed LTRs
of human endogenous viruses of the K family in normal and tumor tissues. Ten
other sequences with a high level of homology to the KIAA1245 mRNA were found in 
the GenBank. The intron-exon structures were determined for all the sequences,
and their exon sequences were compared. The comparison showed that they differ
both in the extent of the exon homology and in the presence or absence of the
HERV-K LTR in the third intron. The revealed sequences form a new gene family
that comprises at least four subfamilies. Two of these subfamilies have the LTR, 
and the other two do not. We showed by PCR that the LTR was integrated into the
introns after the divergence of the orangutan evolutionary branch from other
hominoids but before the divergence of the gorilla branch, i.e., 8-13 million
years ago. The English version of the paper: Russian Journal of Bioorganic
Chemistry, 2002, vol. 28, no. 4; see also http://www.maik.ru.
