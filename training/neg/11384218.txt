A potential use of virus-based transient expression vectors is the large-scale
production of commercial specialty products, which would require the inoculation 
of many acres of plants with the viral vector. However, there are several
concerns about the widespread use of virus-based vectors. Among these are the
spread of the engineered virus to susceptible plants and the generation and
persistence of recombinant viruses in the environment. Using a Tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV)-based transient gene expression vector, 30B, which expresses the
jellyfish green fluorescent protein (30B-GFP), we describe the predominant types 
of hybrid viruses that developed in plants. In general, the recombinants deleted 
the foreign gene and repeated sequences, retaining only those sequences required 
for optimal replication and movement. In pathogenicity studies and challenge
experiments designed to make a comparative assessment of the competitiveness of
the recombinants with the parent virus, the recombinants had reduced vigor and
were less competitive and pathogenic than TMV, a virus which is already present
in the areas where tobacco is grown.
