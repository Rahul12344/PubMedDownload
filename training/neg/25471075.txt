Little research has been done on changes in serum ferritin (s-ferritin) levels
and clinical implications following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT). We retrospectively evaluated the correlation of s-ferritin levels after
HCT with survival in 203 patients. The s-ferritin level was significantly
elevated, with 75% of the patients showing peak levels 90 days after HCT. The
level was >10,000 ng/ml in a total of 43% of the patients, a finding that was
associated with febrile neutropenia or infection. The s-ferritin level at day 30 
and at 1 year after HCT was significantly associated with prognosis. However,
this statistically significant relationship was lost after adjusting for
acute-phase reactants. We conclude that hyperferritinemia is very common and the 
degree of influence of a red blood cell transfusion will vary depending on the
phase after HCT. A prospective study is needed to determine if iron load in and
of itself contributes to a worse prognosis after HCT.
