Of 145 patients admitted to our hospital because of encephalitis-like illness, 50
patients hospitalized for > or =72 hours underwent standardized microbiological
investigations. A confirmed or probable etiologic agent was identified in 20
cases (40%), including Mycoplasma pneumoniae (9 cases). M. pneumoniae and
enterovirus (2), herpes simplex virus (4), Epstein-Barr virus (1), human
herpes-virus 6 (HHV-6) (1), HHV-6 and influenza virus type A (1), influenza virus
type A (1), and Powassan virus (1). In 13 cases (26%), a possible pathogen was
identified, including M. pneumoniae in nine cases. Presenting features included
fever (80% of patients), seizures (78%), focal neurological findings (78%), and
decreased consciousness (47%). The frequency of findings at the time of admission
vs. later in hospitalization was as follows: pleocytosis, 59% vs. 63%;
electroencephalogram abnormalities, 87% vs. 96%; and neuroimaging abnormalities, 
37% vs. 69%, respectively. The outcomes at the time of discharge were as follows:
normal results of physical examination, 32% (16) of the patients; death, 2% (1); 
motor difficulties, 26% (13); global neurological deficits, 16% (severe, 6; mild,
2); mental status changes, 14% (7); visual defects, 8% (4); and hearing
impairment, 2% (1).
