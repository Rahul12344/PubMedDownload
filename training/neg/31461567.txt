Porcine sapoviruses (SaVs) are genetically diverse and widely distributed in
pig-producing countries. Eight genogroups of porcine SaV have been identified,
and genogroup III is the predominant type. Most of the eight genogroups of
porcine SaV are circulating in the United States. In the present study, we report
detection of porcine SaVs in pigs at different ages with clinical diarrhoea using
next-generation sequencing and genetic characterization. All seven cases have
porcine SaV GIII strains detected and one pooled case was found to have a porcine
SaV GVI strain IA27912-B-2018. Sequence analysis showed that seven GIII isolates 
were genetically divergent and formed four different lineages on the trees of
complete genome, RdRP, VP1 and VP2. In addition, these seven GIII isolates had
three different deletion/insertion patterns in an identified variable region
close to the 3' end of VP2. The GVI strain IA27912-B-2018 was closely related to 
strains previously detected in the United States and Japan. A 3-nt deletion in
VP1 region of GVI IA27912-B-2018 was identified. Our study showed that
genetically divergent SaVs of different genogroups are co-circulating in pigs in 
the United States. Future studies comparing the virulence of these different
genogroups in pigs are needed to better understand this virus and to determine if
surveillance and vaccine development are needed to monitor and control porcine
SaVs.
