A challenge to protein based therapies is the ability to produce biologically
active proteins and their ensured delivery. Various approaches have been utilised
including fusion of protein transduction domains with a protein or biomolecule of
interest. A compounding issue is lack of specificity, efficiency and indeed
whether the protein fusions are actually translocated into the cell and not
merely an artefact of the fixation process. Here we present a novel platform,
allowing the inducible export and uptake of a protein of interest. The system
utilises a combination of the Tetracyline repressor system, combined with a
fusion protein containing the N-terminal signal peptide from human chorionic
gonadotropin beta-subunit, and a C-terminal poly-arginine domain for efficient
uptake by target cells. This novel platform was validated using enhanced green
fluorescent protein as the gene of interest. Doxycycline efficiently induced
expression of the fusion protein. The human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit
facilitated the export of the fusion protein into the cell culture media.
Finally, the fusion protein was able to efficiently enter into neighbouring cells
(target cells), mediated by the poly-arginine cell penetrating peptide.
Importantly we have addressed the issue of whether the observed uptake is an
artefact of the fixation process or indeed genuine translocation. In addition
this platform provides a number of potential applications in diverse areas such
as stem cell biology, immune therapy and cancer targeting therapies.
