Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused
by progressive loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Mutations in superoxide
dismutase 1 (SOD1) are a leading cause of ALS, responsible for up to 20% of
familial cases. Although the exact mechanism by which mutant SOD1 causes disease 
remains unknown, multiple studies have shown that reduction of the mutant species
leads to delayed disease onset and extension of lifespan of animal models. This
makes SOD1 an ideal target for gene therapy coupling adeno associated virus
vector (AAV) gene delivery with RNAi molecules. In this review we summarize the
studies done thus far attempting to decrease SOD1 gene expression, using AAV
vectors as delivery tools, and RNAi as therapeutic molecules. Current hurdles to 
be overcome, such as the need for widespread gene delivery through the entire
central nervous system (CNS), are discussed. Continued efforts to improve current
AAV delivery methods and capsids will accelerate the application of these
therapeutics to the clinic.
