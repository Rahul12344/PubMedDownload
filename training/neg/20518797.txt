Eighty-one patients affected by the novel influenza A (H1N1), hospitalized in
North-western Italy, were studied. The median age was 32 years (range 1-81
years). Fifty-six (69%) had an underlying medical condition, including lung
disorders (asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in 34% and obesity in
25%. Fifty percent of them had pneumonia, 12% were admitted to the intensive care
unit and 3% died. Antiviral treatment was initiated in 75% of patients started
within 48 h. Older age and lung and neurocognitive disorders were associated with
severe disease and death.
