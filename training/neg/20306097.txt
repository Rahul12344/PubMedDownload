Human beta-defensins are 2-5 kDa, cationic, microbicidal peptides, which
represent the first-line host defense against several Gram-negative and
Gram-positive bacteria, fungi and viruses. They contain a conserved
disulfide-bridge pattern of three pairs of intramolecular cystine bonds. The
well-known public health problem related with the growing number of
multiresistant bacteria has driven research to look for novel antibiotics, such
beta-defensins and a feasible way to produce them. Heterologous expression of
beta-defensins could be one way to generate large quantities of beta-defensins
for clinical research; however, heterologous expression of beta-defensins has
some biochemical problems, such toxicity toward the host cell, peptide
degradation by proteolytic cell enzymes, size, folding constrains and low
recombinant peptide yields. In this communication, several heterologous systems
for producing human beta-defensins are reviewed.
