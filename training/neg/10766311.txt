Four proteins of bacteriophage MB78 having apparent molecular weights as 35, 14, 
21 and 16 kDa are expressed from 3.9 kb SalI-HindIII fragment located almost in
the middle of the phage genome. Analysis of the sequence supported by some
experimental evidences suggest that these four proteins are expressed from
polycistronic message without any intercistronic gap. Stop and start codons of
consecutive ORFs overlap and rare initiation codons are used. Computer analysis
of the sequence suggests the presence of two more open reading frames within the 
ORFs of 35 and 16 kDa proteins but in the opposite orientation, i.e. in the
complementary strand.
