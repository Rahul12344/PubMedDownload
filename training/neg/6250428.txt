Semen changes in boars after experimental infection with pseudorabies virus.

Larsen RE, Shope RE Jr, Leman AD, Kurtz HJ.

Two groups of adult boars were inoculated with a field strain of pseudorabies
virus (PRV) by intranasal droplet; one group was given 5 x 10(5) median tissue
culture infective doses (TCID50), and the other, 5 x 10(6) TCID50. (A third group
was maintained as controls.) Ejaculates were examined twice a week for volume,
sperm numbers, sperm morphology, and presence of PRV. Severe clinical disease
with fever followed administration of the larger virus dose. Death (one boar),
testicular degeneration, and transient elevation in spermatozoa with proximal
cytoplasmic droplets were seen in different members of this group. The smaller
dose resulted in seroconversion, but did not produce signs of disease. In this
group, volume, sperm numbers, and sperm morphology did not decline when compared 
with base-line values or data of control animals. The virus was not isolated from
semen. Effects of PRV infection on semen quality in boars seem to be related to
the associated clinical signs of systemic disease.
