High-density cultures of mammalian neurons offer a model system for studies of
brain development, but the morphological features of individual neurons is
difficult to ascertain. We show that a herpes virus vector expressing a
bioluminescent protein allows detailed morphometric analyses of living neurons in
complex culture environments. Expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein
(eGFP) was constitutively driven in neurons using the herpes simplex virus
amplicon system. This system allowed us to make novel observations regarding
development in high-density cultures from rat hippocampus and cerebellum. After
the phase of initial neurite outgrowth, maturing neurons continue to show rapid
remodeling of the neurite branches (0.79 +/- 0.11 mum/h per neurite; mean +/-
SEM, n=8), and displacement of the soma within the neurite arbor (1.35 +/- 0.74
mum/h). These results demonstrate that a substantial capacity for morphological
plasticity persists in maturing mammalian CNS neurons after cessation of net
neurite outgrowth in early development.
