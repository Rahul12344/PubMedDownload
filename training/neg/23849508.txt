BACKGROUND: Mobile technology has great potential to improve adherence and
treatment outcomes in healthcare settings. However, text messaging and phone
calls are unaffordable in many resource-limited areas. This study investigates
the use of a no-cost alternative mobile phone technology using missed calls
('buzzing') to act as a patient reminder. The use of missed calls as a patient
reminder was evaluated for feasibility and effectiveness as an appointment
reminder in the follow-up of newly-diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
positive patients in an HIV testing and counselling department in rural
Swaziland.
METHODS: This pilot study uses a before-and-after operational research study
design, with all patients with mobile phones being offered the intervention. The 
primary outcome was the rate of attendance at the HIV testing and counselling
department for collection of results in those with mobile phones before and after
the introduction of the intervention.
RESULTS: Over two-thirds, 71.8% (459/639), of patients had a mobile phone. All
patients with a mobile phone consented to being buzzed. There was no difference
in attendance for follow-up at the clinic before and after the intervention was
implemented (80.1% versus 83.3%, p = 0.401), or after adjusting for confounding
factors (OR 1.13, p = 0.662).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study illustrates that mobile technology may be feasible
in rural, resource-poor settings as there are high rates of mobile phone
ownership and the intervention had a 100% uptake rate, with positive feedback
from staff and patients. In this particular setting, the intervention did not
improve attendance rates. However, further research is planned to investigate the
impact on adherence to appointments and medications in other settings, such as
HIV chronic care follow-up and as part of an enhanced package to improve
adherence.
