Human hantavirus (serotype Puumala) infections are prevalent throughout Europe.
The bank vole is the main reservoir of the Puumala virus (PUUV). Between 2001 and
2006, the annual incidences in Germany ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 per 100,000
inhabitants. About half of the cases were reported from the state of
Baden-Württemberg (BW) in southwest Germany. In 2007, 1,089 PUUV infections were 
reported from BW. This reflects an incidence of 10.1:100,000, which is more than 
11 times higher than the mean incidence of the previous 6 years. Spatial analysis
highlights incidences up to 90:100,000 in the most affected district. The winter 
season 2006/2007 showed an all time high in reported mean temperature. The
previous summer and autumn led to a beech mast year, resulting in favourable feed
conditions for bank voles in the winter season 2006/2007. The causes of the
observed increase in PUUV infections in 2007 cannot be restricted to known cycles
in the bank vole population. Favourable feed conditions, a mild winter and an
early onset of spring may have influenced bank vole population size as well as
human exposure to infectious rodent excretions. Further epidemiologic studies are
necessary to better understand the interaction between environmental factors,
occurrence of Puumala virus in bank voles and the risk for human disease.
