INTRODUCTION: Lassa virus (LASV), the most prominent human pathogen of the
Arenaviridae, is transmitted to humans from infected rodents and can cause Lassa 
Fever (LF). The sizeable disease burden in West Africa, numerous imported LF
cases worldwide, and the possibility that LASV can be used as an agent of
biological warfare make a strong case for vaccine development. There are no
licensed LASV vaccines and the antiviral treatment is limited to an off-label use
of ribavirin that is only partially effective.
AREAS COVERED: LASV vaccine development is hampered by high cost of
biocontainment requirement, the absence of appropriate small animal models,
genetic diversity of LASV species, and by high HIV-1 prevalence in LASV endemic
areas. Over the past 15 years several vaccine platforms have been developed.
Natural history of LASV and pathogenesis of the disease provide strong
justification for replication-competent (RC) vaccine as one of the most feasible 
approaches to control LF. Development of LASV vaccine candidates based on
reassortant, recombinant, and alphavirus replicon technologies is covered in this
review. Expert commentary: Two lead RC vaccine candidates, reassortant ML29 and
recombinant VSV/LASV, have been successfully tested in non-human primates and
have been recommended by international vaccine experts for rapid clinical
development. Both platforms have powerful molecular tools to further secure
safety, improve immunogenicity, and cross-protection. These platforms are well
positioned to design multivalent vaccines to protect against all LASV strains
citculatrd in West Africa. The regulatory pathway of Candid #1, the first
live-attenuated arenaviral vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic, will be a
reasonable guideline for LASV vaccine efficacy trials.
