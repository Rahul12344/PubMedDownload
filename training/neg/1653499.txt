As part of our efforts to produce native molecules of the host protective antigen
(VP2) of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in microorganisms, we have
restored nucleotide sequences encoding the VP2 N-terminus which were not present 
in the original clone. In addition to this process, we produced constructs that
contained +5, +4, -1, and -2 frameshifts that still allowed expression of the
IBDV polyprotein, VP2 and VP3. The size of translation products and examination
of the nucleotide sequence lead us to speculate that both +1 frameshifting and
internal initiation events lead to the synthesis of IBDV proteins in Escherichia 
coli.
