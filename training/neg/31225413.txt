Backgrounds/Aims: This study intended to evaluate patient safety and efficiency
of facility utilization following simplified ultra-rapid intravenous infusion of 
hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) in recipients of hepatitis B virus-associated
adult liver transplantation (LT), who visited our outpatient clinic.
Methods: Our simplified ultra-rapid infusion protocol was to directly infuse 50
ml volume of 10,000 IU HBIG for 20-25 minutes on an ambulatory basis. The
incidence of adverse side-effects and the efficiency of facility utilization were
assessed retrospectively.
Results: A total of 1,513 patients received 12,472 sessions of HBIG infusion
according to simplified ultra-rapid infusion method. Of these, 1,172 patients
were converted from conventional ultra-rapid infusion method, and received 8,352 
sessions of HBIG infusion for 18 months (mean 7.1 times; 4.8 times per year). The
remaining 341 de novo patients received 4,120 sessions of HBIG infusion for 18
months (mean 12.1 times; 8.1 times per year). None of these patients experienced 
any adverse side-effects following the simplified ultra-rapid infusion. The
maximal capacity of HBIG infusion sessions at the injection facility of our
outpatient clinic was increased from 65-70 sessions to 80 sessions, after
introduction of simplified ultra-rapid infusion method. Mean trough anti-HBs
titer was lower, and mean interval of HBIG infusion was longer in the combination
therapy group compared with HBIG monotherapy group.
Conclusions: Our high-volume study indicates that in nearly all LT recipients,
rapid infusion of highly purified HBIG within 30 minutes was well-tolerated. This
suggests that it would be reasonable to perform simplified ultra-rapid infusion
protocol widely for patient convenience.
