Rising rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among adolescents
and young adults underscore the importance of interventions for this population. 
While the morbidity and mortality of HIV has greatly decreased over the years,
maintaining high rates of adherence is necessary to receive optimal medication
effects. Few studies have developed interventions for adolescents and young
adults and none have specifically been developed for sexual minority (lesbian,
gay, and bisexual; LGB) youth. Guided by an evidence-based adult intervention and
adolescent qualitative interviews, we developed a multicomponent,
technology-enhanced, customizable adherence intervention for adolescents and
young adults for use in a clinical setting. The two cases presented in this paper
illustrate the use of the five-session positive strategies to enhance problem
solving (Positive STEPS) intervention, based on cognitive-behavioral techniques
and motivational interviewing. We present a perinatally infected heterosexual
woman and a behaviorally infected gay man to demonstrate the unique challenges
faced by these youth and showcase how the intervention can be customized. Future 
directions include varying the number of intervention sessions based on mode of
HIV infection and incorporating booster sessions.
