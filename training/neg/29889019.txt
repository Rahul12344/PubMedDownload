Viruses are the most abundant component of the human microbiota. Recent evidence 
has uncovered a rich diversity of viruses within the female bladder, including
both bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. We conducted whole-genome sequencing 
of the bladder microbiome of 30 women: 10 asymptomatic 'healthy' women and 20
women with an overactive bladder. These metagenomes include sequences
representative of human, bacterial and viral DNA. This analysis, however, focused
specifically on viral sequences. Using the bioinformatic tool virMine, we
discovered sequence fragments, as well as complete genomes, of bacteriophages and
the eukaryotic virus JC polyomavirus. The method employed here is a critical
proof of concept: the genomes of viral populations within the low-biomass bladder
microbiota can be reconstructed through whole-genome sequencing of the entire
microbial community.
