Award-winning mass media campaign hits home with Dominican youth.

Black B.

PIP: Four television advertisements produced for an AIDS prevention campaign by
the AIDS Control and Prevention (AIDSCAP) Project in the Dominican Republic
depict young, attractive individuals with multiple partners, and one youth with
AIDS. The spots target adolescents and their parents with the message to remain
monogamous and use condoms. They were made by a leading Dominican advertising
agency, using high-quality production techniques and attractive young actors to
convey well-researched public health messages. Hard-hitting radio announcements, 
posters, and roadside billboards were also developed as part of a comprehensive
national campaign launched in 1993 against HIV/AIDS. The campaign's interactive
advertising, coordinated approach, and parental and media involvement are
described.
