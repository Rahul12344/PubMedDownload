We developed a strategy to create novel genetically encoded switches based on
translational repression. We illustrated its efficacy by incorporating two copies
of an RNA hairpin in the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of a target mRNA and
demonstrating 7-fold translational repression upon expression of a ligand - the
BIV Tat peptide.
