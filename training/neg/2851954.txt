Channel catfish broodfish were examined nondestructively for the presence of
channel catfish virus (CCV), using a nucleic acid-probing technique. A dot blot
assay was tested and shown to be accurate and rapid in the diagnosis of CCV. Two 
CCV-positive fish were successfully mated, and fertilized eggs were collected.
Offspring that hatched were tested and were shown to have CCV. This result
indicated vertical transmission of CCV, a herpesvirus.
