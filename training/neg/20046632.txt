This study re-evaluated the role of fomites and personnel in the mechanical
transport and transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV) between pig populations. Swabs were collected from hands, boots,
coveralls, and other fomites following contact with infected pigs and compared
with identical samples collected in the absence of PRRSV exposure. Na√Øve pigs
were provided contact with contaminated fomites/personnel and blood tested
periodically post-exposure [positive exposure population (PEP)] and compared with
populations that did not gain exposure via these routes [negative exposure
population (NEP)]. The majority of swab samples from hands, coveralls, and boots 
from personnel and fomite samples (cable snare and bleeding equipment) following 
contact with the PRRSV-infected Source Population. Transmission of PRRSV to the
PEP was observed (7/7) cases but not in the NEP. In conclusion, under the proper 
conditions, transport and transmission of PRRSV by fomites and personnel may
occur between swine populations in the absence of intervention.
