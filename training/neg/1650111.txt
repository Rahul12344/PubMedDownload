In addition to muscle changes due to peripheral nervous system involvement,
primary myopathic changes associated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
have also been described. We studied seven cases: two had developed an acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), four had seroconverted to HIV but were
otherwise asymptomatic, one was HIV seronegative when the biopsy was performed
and one was biopsied twice. Besides the HIV no other infectious agent was
detected. Muscle biopsies showed: (a) muscle fiber necrosis and regeneration; (b)
inflammatory changes with moderate perivascular infiltration; and (c) unusual
myofibrillary disorganization. Immunocytochemical techniques using anti-HIV
monoclonal antibodies showed the presence of the virus in one biopsy. HIV-RNA was
detected by in situ hybridization in the same biopsy. With both techniques the
HIV was detected in isolated mononuclear cells in the muscle endomysium and not
within the muscle fibers. Muscle involvement associated with HIV infection may be
related, at least in some cases, to the presence of the virus in interstitial
cells.
