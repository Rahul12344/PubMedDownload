Structural polypeptides of IVRI vaccine strain and two field isoaltes of Fowlpox 
virus (Bareilly isolate and Panchmahal isolate) were analysed on SDS-PAGE and by 
immunoblotting technique. In 5%-20% gradient acrylamide gel 31, 29 and 31
polypeptide bands and in 7.5%-15% gradient gel 45, 37 and 39 polypeptide bands
were detected after Coomassie blue staining respectively for Bareilly isolate,
Panchmahal isolate and IVRI vaccine strain. The molecular weight (MW) of the
polypeptides ranged from 226.10 to 10.30 kDa with total MW of 2650.12, 2259.50,
and 2378.68 kDa respectively for the three viruses. The immunoblot revealed 35,
29 and 30 immunogenic polypeptides indicating most virion polypeptides to be
immunogenic in nature. Although most polypeptides had similar electrophoretic
pattern both in SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, still the three viruses could be
differentiated. The viruses were found to be antigenically different with
Panchmahal isolate lacking the polypeptides 81.15, 76.33, 39.30, 37.50 and 29.35 
kDa and the vaccine strain lacking 76.33, 37.50 and 29.35 kDa polypeptides as
were present in Bareilly isolate.
