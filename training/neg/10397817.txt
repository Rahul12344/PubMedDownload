The Trichoplusia ni BTI-Tn-5B1-4 (Tn-5B1-4) insect cell line has received
considerable attention as a host for the baculovirus expression vector system. In
the present study, suspension cultures were used to compare Tn-5B1-4 cell
aggregates and cells selected to grow predominantly as individual cells. No
significant difference was found between cell aggregates and cells growing
predominantly individually in regard to cell growth rate, glucose consumption and
lactate accumulation, and specific recombinant protein synthesis levels. In
addition, the levels of recombinant protein synthesis were considerably higher
than those produced by the commonly used Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-9 insect cell
line.
