Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a complex disease with aspects of virology (human
herpesvirus-8, HHV-8, and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV), immunology
(immunodeficiency), hyperplasia (multiple widely spaced de novo lesions), and
neoplasia (metastases) that has always been the most common AIDS-defining
malignancy. The lesional spindle cell has been classified as being derived from
either blood vascular or, more recently, lymphatic endothelial cell origin. This 
study revealed a spectrum of endothelial cell ultrastructure from lymphatic to
blood vascular. It demonstrated frequent Weibel-Palade bodies and gap junctions. 
The spindle cells were shown to behave as facultative phagocytes, internalizing
and processing necrotic cells and leaked red blood cells (RBCs). Fragmented RBCs 
were equivalent to the "hyaline droplets" seen by light microscopy. The final
stages of RBC disintegration were hemosiderin and ferritin. Most significantly,
this study disclosed that KS is actually composed of a single type of randomly
oriented spindle cell forming vessels of varying size and integrity.
