Formation of infectious HIV-1 involves assembly of Gag polyproteins into immature
particles and subsequent assembly of mature capsids after proteolytic disassembly
of the Gag shell. We report a 12-mer peptide, capsid assembly inhibitor (CAI),
that binds the capsid (CA) domain of Gag and inhibits assembly of immature- and
mature-like capsid particles in vitro. CAI was identified by phage display
screening among a group of peptides with similar sequences that bind to a single 
reactive site in CA. Its binding site was mapped to CA residues 169-191, with an 
additional contribution from the last helix of CA. This result was confirmed by a
separate X-ray structure analysis showing that CAI inserts into a conserved
hydrophobic groove and alters the CA dimer interface. The CAI binding site is a
new target for antiviral development, and CAI is the first known inhibitor
directed against assembly of immature HIV-1.
