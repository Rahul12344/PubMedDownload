To identify genes that are expressed in MS pathogenesis, we have analyzed a
normalized cDNA library made from mRNA obtained from CNS lesions of a patient
with primary progressive MS. Complementary DNA clones obtained from this library 
were subjected to automated DNA sequencing to generate expressed sequence tags.
Analysis of this MS cDNA library revealed the presence of 54 cDNAs that were
associated with immune activation and indicated the presence of an ongoing
inflammatory response with evidence of both cell-mediated and humoral immune
responses. The surprising finding was that 16 of the cDNAs encoded autoantigens
associated with seven other autoimmune disorders, while only three of these 16
autoantigen cDNAs were present in a similarly constructed adult brain library.
Such aberrant autoantigen expression could provide a source of secondary
autoimmune stimulation that could contribute to the ongoing inflammatory response
in MS. In addition, two cDNAs were found that mapped to a known MS susceptibility
locus (5p14-p12): one encoded an excitatory amino acid transporter and the other 
a human homologue of the Drosophila disabled gene. This approach to the molecular
biology of MS pathogenesis may help to illuminate previously unappreciated
aspects of this disease.
