The efficacy and safety of ZOSTAVAX in subjects 60 years of age and older was
established in the Shingles Prevention Study (SPS) and in subjects 50 to 59 years
of age in the ZOSTAVAX Efficacy and Safety Trial (ZEST). We evaluated the safety 
and immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX in a total of 150 Taiwanese subjects ≥50 years of 
age, who received a single dose of ZOSTAVAX. gpELISA was used to determine
geometric mean titers (GMT) of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody. The
geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of the VZV antibody from the pre-vaccination to
the 4 week post-vaccination time point was calculated. There was an overall
increase in GMT from 128.45 to 391.85 at 4 weeks post-vaccination. The estimated 
GMFR was 3.05 (95% CI: 2.60 to 3.57).There were no serious adverse events for 28 
days following vaccination. This study demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity
of ZOSTAVAX among healthy Taiwanese adults.
