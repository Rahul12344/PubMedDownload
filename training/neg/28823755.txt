The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine prevents HPV-related diseases, including
anogenital cancers and genital warts. In the United States, while it is
recommended to adolescents ages 11 to 12, catch-up vaccination is available for
those previously unvaccinated until age 26. Parental decisions or lack of
provider recommendation during adolescence are barriers to on-time vaccination.
Young adult women, ages 18 to 26, are a key catch-up vaccination population as
this is a period for autonomous decision-making, high healthcare utilization, and
other recommended prevention behaviors. Additional intervention research is
required to promote HPV vaccine uptake among young adult women. Evidence-based
and theory-informed interventions need to be developed and evaluated to reach a
large number of women. In order to improve HPV vaccination among young adult
women, future research should integrate the themes of health literacy,
alternative healthcare settings, and OB/GYN providers to facilitate improved
access and shared decision-making for the vaccine. This last chance for
HPV-related cancer prevention should not be forgotten in public health efforts.
