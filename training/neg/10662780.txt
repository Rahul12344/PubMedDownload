By an expression cloning method using Fas-transgenic Balb3T3 cells, we tried to
obtain inhibitory genes against Fas-mediated apoptosis and identified
proto-oncogene c-K-ras. Transient expression of K-Ras mutants revealed that
oncogenic mutant K-Ras (RasV12) strongly inhibited, whereas dominant-inhibitory
mutant K-Ras (RasN17) enhanced, Fas-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting
Fas-triggered activation of caspases without affecting an expression level of
Fas. Among the target molecules of Ras, including Raf (mitogen-activated protein 
kinase kinase kinase [MAPKKK]), phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI-3) kinase, and Ral
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RalGDS), only the constitutively active form 
of Raf (Raf-CAAX) could inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis. In addition, the
constitutively active form of MAPKK (SDSE-MAPKK) suppressed Fas-mediated
apoptosis, and MKP-1, a phosphatase specific for classical MAPK, canceled the
protective activity of oncogenic K-Ras (K-RasV12), Raf-CAAX, and SDSE-MAPKK.
Furthermore, physiological activation of Ras by basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) protected Fas-transgenic Balb3T3 cells from Fas-mediated apoptosis. bFGF
protection was also dependent on the activation of the MAPK pathway through Ras. 
All the results indicate that the activation of MAPK through Ras inhibits
Fas-mediated apoptosis in Balb3T3 cells, which may play a role in oncogenesis.
