Centrosome aberrations are a frequent finding in human tumors. However, very
little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to disruption of
centrosome duplication control and the functional consequences of aberrant
centrosome numbers. The high-risk human papillomavirus Type 16 (HPV-16) E6 and E7
oncoproteins are overexpressed in HPV-associated malignancies of the anogenital
tract and have been instrumental in delineating different pathways of centrosome 
amplification. Whereas the E6 oncoprotein was found to provoke centrosome
accumulation, the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein triggers a genuine disruption of the
centrosome duplication cycle. Importantly, the E7 oncoprotein can rapidly cause
centrosome overduplication through a pathway that involves the concurrent
formation of multiple daughters at single maternal centrioles (centriole
flowers). Several lines of evidence suggest that cyclin E/CDK2 complexes and
Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) are crucial players in this process. These findings
underscore that the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein is a unique tool to dissect normal and 
abnormal centriole biogenesis and the underlying molecular circuitry.
