Gene transfer vectors based on the replication-defective human parvovirus,
adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV-2), are viable candidates for in vivo and ex
vivo human use. However, widespread testing of AAV vectors has been limited by
difficulties in generating pure, high-titer vector stocks that are fully
characterized. To address these issues, we have developed a single-step
purification scheme using heparin affinity chromatography. Recovery from the
crude lysate starting material exceeds 70%, and the end product rAAV vector is
highly purified and appears to be free of adenovirus and cellular contaminates.
Importantly, purified vectors retain predicted in vivo biologic activity.
Concurrently, we have developed simple and rapid approaches for vector
quantification using real-time PCR. These new methods, combined with the use of
stable producer cell lines for rAAV production, make the commercial production of
rAAV vectors for human use truly viable and pragmatic.
