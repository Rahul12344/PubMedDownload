Herpes simplex virus type 2 encephalitis in two homosexual men with persistent
lymphadenopathy.

Within a 5-month period, 2 homosexual men with persistent lymphadenopathy
developed clinical findings consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV)
encephalitis. These signs included abrupt change in mental status, seizures,
cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and localized electroencephalographic
abnormalities showing temporal lobe involvement. Initial computed tomographic
scans were unremarkable. Treatment with adenine arabinoside was instituted and
temporal lobe biopsies were performed. Although virus-specific antigens were
detectable in only 1 patient, cultures of biopsy tissue from both patients
yielded HSV type 2 organisms. Spiking fevers persisted and the patients failed to
improve, prompting administration of acyclovir. Both patients recovered gradually
after their second course of antiviral therapy and survived with severe
neurological deficits. These patients should raise concerns about an increased
incidence of type 2 encephalitic illness among homosexual men with persistent
lymphadenopathy or acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In addition, the
importance of using HSV type 2 antibody in the immunofluorescence test of brain
biopsy tissue for rapid diagnosis of the disease is emphasized.
