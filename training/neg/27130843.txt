BACKGROUND & AIMS: Universal one-time antibody testing for hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection has been recommended by the centers for disease control (CDC) and
the United States preventative services task force (USPSTF) for Americans born
1945-1965 (birth cohort). Limited data exists addressing national HCV testing
practices. We studied patterns and predictors of HCV testing across the U.S.
within the birth cohort utilizing data from the national corporate data warehouse
of the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) health system.
METHODS: Testing was defined as any HCV test including antibody, RNA or genotype 
performed during 2000-2013.
RESULTS: Of 6,669,388 birth cohort veterans, 4,221,135 (63%) received care within
the VA from 2000-2013 with two or more visits. Of this group, 2,139,935 (51%) had
HCV testing with 8.1% HCV antibody and 5.4% RNA positive. Significant variation
in testing was observed across centers (range: 7-83%). Older, male,
African-Americans, with established risk factors and receiving care from urban
centers of excellence were more likely to be tested. Among veterans free of other
established risk factors (HIV negative, HBV negative, ALT ⩽40U/L, FIB-4 ⩽1.45, or
APRI <0.5), HCV antibody and RNA were positive in 2.8% and 0.9%, respectively,
comparable to established national average. At least 2.4-4.4% of veterans had
scores suggesting advanced fibrosis (APRI ⩾1.5 or FIB-4 >3.25) with >30-43%
having positive HCV RNA but >16-20% yet to undergo testing for HCV.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant disparities are observed in HCV testing within the
United States VA health system. Examination of the predictors of testing and HCV 
positivity may help inform national screening policies.
LAY SUMMARY: Analysis of United States Veterans Administration data show
significant disparities in hepatitis C virus testing of veterans born 1945-1965
(birth cohort). A fifth of those not tested had evidence of advanced liver
fibrosis. Our data suggests some predictors for this disparity and will
potentially help inform future policy measures in the era of universal birth
cohort testing for HCV.
