Dietary supplements are often used to improve the nutritional status of people
living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV). Arthrospira platensis (Asp), also known as
Spirulina, is a cyanobacterium rich in proteins and micronutrients. Cell and
animal trials described immune-modulating, antiretroviral and antioxidant
activities. This pilot study describes the effects of the supplementation of 5
g/day of Asp on a pre-highly-active antiretroviral therapy (pre-HAART),
HIV-infected, adult female population. It was conducted as a three-month
randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compared a cup supplementation of five
grams/day of Asp with a placebo of equal protein content and energy. The study
included 73 HIV-infected women. The immediate outcome variables were CD4 T-cells,
viral load and immune activation by CD8 T-cells expressing CD38. The antioxidant 
status was assessed by way of the total antioxidant capacity of the serum (TAOS).
The renal function was documented by way of creatinine, urea and the calculated
glomerular filtration rate. Statistical analyses were carried out with
non-parametric tests, and the effect size of each interaction was calculated. No 
differences in the immunological and virological markers between the Asp and the 
placebo group could be observed. In the placebo group, 21 of 30 patients (70%)
developed concomitant events, while in the Asp group, only 12 of 28 patients
(43%) did. Both groups registered a significant weight increase; 0.5 kg (p <
0.05) in the Asp group and 0.65 kg (p < 0.05) in the placebo group. The
antioxidant capacity increase of 56 (1-98) µM for Asp was significantly different
from the decrease observed in the placebo group (p < 0.001). A slight increase in
the creatinine level of 0.1 g/dL (p < 0.001) was observed in the Asp group, and
no effect was observed in the urea levels. The improvement of the antioxidant
capacity under Asp, shown for the first time on PLHIV, could become a focus for
future research on the nutritional and health effects of Spirulina. The observed 
slight, but significant increase of serum creatinine needs further evaluation,
especially with varying doses of Asp.
