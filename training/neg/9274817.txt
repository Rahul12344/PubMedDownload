Eleven German laboratories and one Swiss laboratory initiated a quality
assessment study to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of their polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) for detection of HIV-1 DNA. Following its own PCR protocols,
each laboratory tested a panel of ten coded samples consisting of cell pellets
containing 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 10(2), 10(3) and 10(4) ACH-2 cells per 1.5 x 10(5)
uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Of the twelve participating
laboratories, three reported correct results for the dilution series as well as
for uninfected specimens. One or more classification errors were recorded for 12%
of the samples for which the diagnosis was expected to be positive or negative.
Samples containing 10 copies of the target template were correctly reported by
eleven of the twelve participants. The average sensitivity was 97%. The results
of the study revealed no significant differences between the Amplicor kit and
in-house procedures. Most of the classification errors occurred in specimens from
HIV-negative samples. Out of 36 negative samples, 5 were reported false positive,
showing that contamination remains a problem for some laboratories, regardless of
the PCR test performed. Careful laboratory techniques and internal as well as
external quality control procedures will help avoiding carryover contamination.
