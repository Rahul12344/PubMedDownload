Viral replication depends on specific interactions with host factors. For
example, poliovirus RNA replication requires association with intracellular
membranes. Brefeldin A (BFA), which induces a major rearrangement of the cellular
secretory apparatus, is a potent inhibitor of poliovirus RNA replication. Most
aspects governing the relationship between viral replication complex and the host
membranes remain poorly defined. To explore these interactions, we used a genetic
approach and isolated BFA-resistant poliovirus variants. Mutations within viral
proteins 2C and 3A render poliovirus resistant to BFA. In the absence of BFA,
viruses containing either or both of these mutations replicated similarly to wild
type. In the presence of BFA, viruses carrying a single mutation in 2C or 3A
exhibited an intermediate-growth phenotype, while the double mutant was fully
resistant. The viral proteins 2C and 3A have critical roles in both RNA
replication and vesicle formation. The identification of BFA resistant mutants
may facilitate the identification of cellular membrane-associated proteins
necessary for induction of vesicle formation and RNA replication. Importantly,
our data underscore the dramatic plasticity of the host-virus interactions
required for successful viral replication.
