Gelelectrophoretic analysis of phenol-extractable leaf proteins from different
viroid/host combinations.

Camacho Henriquez A, SÃ¤nger HL.

The phenol-soluble proteins from leaves of healthy and viroid-infected plants
were compared after separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After staining with
Coomassie blue, alterations in the protein patterns of infected plants were found
which resulted from an increase or decrease of certain protein bands. After
infection with the same viroid, different hosts show characteristic changes in
the protein pattern which suggest that these alterations are host-specific rather
than pathogenspecific. After infection of tomato plants with different viroid
"species" a protein with the apparent MW of 14,000 (p14 tom) was found to
accumulate dramatically. This protein also accumulates in tomato plants after
viral and fungus infections and the rate of its accumulation is directly related 
to the severity of symptoms developed by the diseased plants. It is assumed,
therefore, that it is a response of tomato plants to infection in general.
