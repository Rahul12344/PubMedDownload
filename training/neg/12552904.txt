Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized for the DNA amplification from
transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) positive serum samples. Five TTV DNA
fragments, overlapped about 90% of the genome, were amplified by long template
PCR for the generation of TTV subgenome. Recombinant plasmids were obtained by
directly inserting PCR products into pT-Adv vector, and DNA sequence analyses
showed they were TTV DNA fragments. By using specific restriction enzymes, five
TTV DNA fragments were ligated into a TTV DNA subgenome clone and named as
TTV021. TTV021 has been deposited in GenBank database with the accession number
AF254410. The results of computer analyses showed that TTV021, 3472 nt long,
contains two open reading frames (ORF1, 785 aa; ORF2, 146 aa). Identity
alignments between TTV021 and other TTV isolates indicated several high conserved
regions existed. Phylogenetic analysis of 356 nt from TTV021 suggested that the
isolate has close evolutionary relationship with CHN1 (type 1a), but has far
relation with other TTV isolates.
