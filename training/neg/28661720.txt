Adaptive B cell response is a key arm of protective immunity against influenza
viruses. Owing to the acutely infectious and cytopathic nature of these viruses, 
efficient containment of viral spread relies on the prompt provision of
protective antibodies to the site of virus infection, the respiratory tract (RT).
To accelerate the protective antibody response, B cell responses can be
ectopically induced, maintained, and reactivated in the lungs after primary and
secondary infection, thereby providing an anatomical advantage in supplying
neutralizing antibodies against reinfecting viruses with faster kinetics.
However, the prompt supply of protective antibodies may be insufficient to
protect against reinfection because influenza viruses can easily change their
antigenic profiles to escape antibody surveillance. B cell responses have
multiple strategies for adjusting antibody repertoires according to viral
fitness, one of which is the formation of local germinal centers capable of
selecting B cell repertoires for antigenically subdominant, but conserved,
epitopes. In this review, we discuss several unique aspects of B cell responses
that take place at local sites to combat acutely infectious and rapidly mutating 
influenza viruses.
