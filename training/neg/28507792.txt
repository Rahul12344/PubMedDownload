Combination of oncolytic virotherapy with immunomodulators is emerging as a
promising therapeutic strategy for numerous tumor entities. In this study, we
developed measles Schwarz vaccine strain vectors encoding immunomodulators to
support different phases in the establishment of antitumor immune responses.
Therapeutic efficacy of the novel vectors was evaluated in the immunocompetent
MC38cea tumor model. We identified vectors encoding an IL-12 fusion protein
(MeVac FmIL-12) and an antibody against PD-L1 (MeVac anti-PD-L1), respectively,
as the most effective. Treatment of established tumors with MeVac FmIL-12
achieved 90% complete remissions. Profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment 
revealed activation of a type 1 T helper cell-directed response, with MeVac
FmIL-12 ensuring potent early natural killer and effector T cell activation as
well as upregulation of the effector cytokines IFN-γ and TNF-α. CD8+ T cells were
found to be essential for the therapeutic efficacy of MeVac FmIL-12. Results of
this study present MeVac FmIL-12 as a novel approach for targeted IL-12 delivery 
and elucidate mechanisms of successful immunovirotherapy.
