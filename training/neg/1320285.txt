Formalin fixed liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, duodenum and appendix tissues 
from nine rabbits, experimentally infected with rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus
(RHDV), were investigated for evidence of RHDV antigen by the direct
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex immunohistochemical method. In all the rabbits
examined, RHDV antigen was detected in degenerative and necrotic hepatocytes of
the liver tissues. The area involved coincided with histopathological lesions on 
serial liver sections. The RHDV antigen was expressed in the cytoplasm of the
hepatocytes, suggesting that RHDV replicated in these cells. RHDV antigen was
also detected in the spleen. The results of immunohistochemistry were supported
by the demonstration of RHDV protein by Western blot analysis and of RHDV
particles by protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy in the liver homogenate
from all the rabbits that were examined.
