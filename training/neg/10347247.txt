At present no antiviral agents are available for treatment of infection by the
pathogenic poxvirus molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV). Here we report the
identification and characterization of an inhibitor active against the
virus-encoded type-1 topoisomerase, an enzyme likely to be required for MCV
replication. We screened a library of marine extracts and natural products from
microorganisms using MCV topoisomerase assays in vitro. The cyclic depsipeptide
sansalvamide A was found to inhibit topoisomerase-catalyzed DNA relaxation.
Sansalvamide A was inactive against two other DNA-modifying enzymes tested as a
counterscreen. Assays of discrete steps in the topoisomerase reaction cycle
revealed that sansalvamide A inhibited DNA binding and thereby covalent complex
formation, but not resealing of a DNA nick in a preformed covalent complex.
Sansalvamide A also inhibits DNA binding by the isolated catalytic domain,
thereby specifying the part of the protein sensitive to sansalvamide A. These
data specify the mechanism by which sansalvamide A inhibits MCV topoisomerase.
Cyclic depsipeptides related to sansalvamide A represent a potentially promising 
chemical family for development of anti-MCV agents.
