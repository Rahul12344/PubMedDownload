The murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) M56 is one of three proteins that combine to
form the MCMV terminase, required for cleavage and packaging of viral DNA into
capsids. Deletion of M56 from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of
the MCMV genome was considered lethal, as the mutant BAC failed to reconstitute
infectious virus. Reintroduction of M56 at an ectopic locus complemented the
deletion, allowing reconstitution of a virus that replicated with wild-type
efficiency. However, neither the reintroduction of M56 sequences encoding an
N-terminal epitope fusion nor a mutation targeting a region in M56 implicated as 
an ATPase active site was capable of restoring virus viability. In contrast, a
frame shift mutation in M56a, a putative open reading frame that overlaps M56,
had no effect on viral replication. We conclude that M56a is dispensable, whereas
M56 residues comprising the proposed ATPase active site are critical for
terminase function and viral replication.
