Receptors for T2, T4 and T6 phages in Sh. dysenteriae 7 and other serotypes of
Sh. dysenteriae.

Goldhar J, Eulan E, Kacewman B.

The sensitivity of four strains of Sh. dysenteriae and of nine strains
representing other serotypes of Sh. dynsenteriae to phages T2, T4 and T6 was
examined. Different extracts, prepared from sensitive strains were tested for
their capacity of phage inactivation. We found that the receptor substance for
phage T2 is localized differently in various strains: In Sh. dysenteriae 7, it
was found in bacterial extracts obtained by water/phenol at 68 degrees C and in
extracts obtained by trichloracetic acid; in Sh. dysenteriae 2 and Sh.
dysenteriae 6, it was found in extracts obtained by heating in water at 65
degrees C. None of the tested extracts of strains Sh. dysenteriae 1, Sh.
dysenteriae 4 and Sh. dysenteriae 9, sensitive to phage T2 and T6 and T6,
revealed receptro activity for these phages. Most of the extracts, which showed
receptor activity for phage T2, appeared to be weak or completely inactive for
phage T6. Several strains appeared to be sensitive to phage T4 and the receptor
active substance was found in the bacterial extracts obtained by water/phenol at 
68 degrees C. The sensitivity of Sh. dysenteriae smooth strains to "rough
specific" T4 phage is discussed.
