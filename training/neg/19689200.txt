HIV-1 from infected subjects has been characterized in order to provide a more
accurate view of the strains that are currently found in a given region. In this 
report, we focused on characterizing the pol gene diversity obtained from newly
diagnosed patients in Santos metropolitan area, Brazil. This region is composed
of nine cities and an international port. Analysis of the 33 samples revealed
that 22 strains belonged to subtype B, 4 to subtype F, and 2 to subtype C; 5
strains were B/F recombinants. Our results demonstrated that 18.2% of samples
were primary antiretroviral resistance genotypic mutations, with high-level
resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors in both subtypes B and F and in
recombinant forms B/F. Our data revealed that the primary antiretroviral
resistance genotypic mutations should be carefully investigated in developing
countries with widespread access to antiretrovirals, such as Brazil.
