In an effort to validate previous research suggesting remarkable resistance of
norovirus to free chlorine disinfection, we characterized the disinfection
response of purified and dispersed Norwalk virus (NV) by bench-scale free
chlorine disinfection using RT-PCR for virus assays. The inactivation of NV by
two doses of free chlorine (1 and 5mg/L) at pH 6 and 5 degrees C based on two
RT-PCR assays was similar to that of coliphage MS2, but much faster than that of 
poliovirus 1. Despite the underestimation of virus inactivation by RT-PCR assays,
the predicted CT values for NV based on RT-PCR assays are lower than the ones for
most other important waterborne viruses and the CT guidelines for chlorine
disinfection of viruses under the Surface Water Treatment Rule by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency. Overall, the results of this study
indicate that NV is not highly resistant to free chlorine disinfection as
suggested by previous research and it is likely that NV contamination of drinking
water can be controlled by adequate free chlorine disinfection practices with
provision of proper pre-treatment processes before chlorination.
