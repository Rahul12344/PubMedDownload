Type I interferon (IFN) such as IFN-alpha have demonstrated relative efficiency
in HIV-infected patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. Nevertheless, their clinical uses
have been restricted by several major side effects. IFN-tau is a non-cytotoxic
type I IFN. In the present manuscript, we described its in vitro effects towards 
HIV replication and its mode of action. IFN-tau is a potent antiviral molecule
that interferes with an early step of HIV biological cycle. Moreover, it induces 
IL-6 synthesis by macrophages, and this cytokine favorises its antiviral
efficacy, probably by amplifying the induction of 2', 5'OAS and RNase L.
Altogether, these results confirm the interest of IFN-tau as adjuvant therapy in 
HIV infection, and more particularly in HIV/HCV-infected patients.
