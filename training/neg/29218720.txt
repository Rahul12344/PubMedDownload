Using nationwide Danish registries we examined the long-term risk of cervical
cancer in women diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) 
(including adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)) on the cone compared to women with a
normal cytology test. Initially, we identified women born 1918-1990, who were
recorded as living in Denmark between January 1, 1978 and December 31, 2012. From
the Pathology Data Bank information on CIN3 on the cone, margins status,
histological type of CIN3 and cervical cytology results was extracted. Cox
proportional hazard model was used to estimate the relative risk of subsequent
cervical cancer. We included 59,464 women with CIN3 on the cone and 1,918,508
women with a normal cytology test. Overall, women diagnosed with CIN3 had a
higher risk of subsequent cervical cancer compared to women with normal cytology 
(HR = 2.06; 95%CI: 1.81-2.35). Analyses according to time since conization showed
elevated risks in all time periods, and 25 years or more after conization the
relative risk was significantly increased (HR = 2.56; 95%CI: 1.37-4.77). Twenty
years or more after conization, also women with negative margins had an increased
relative risk (HR = 2.49; 95%CI: 1.12-5.57). In addition, the long-term relative 
risk of cervical cancer varied with the different histological types of CIN3 and 
was highest for AIS (HR = 7.50; 95%CI: 1.87-30.01, 10-14 years after conization).
In conclusion, women diagnosed with CIN3 on the cone have a long-lasting
increased risk of cervical cancer even when the margins on the cone are negative.
