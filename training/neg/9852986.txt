The incidence of herpes zoster increases markedly with advancing age, and this
appears to be causally related to an age-dependent decline in varicella-zoster
virus (VZV)-specific cellular immunity. Psychologic stress has also been linked
to the occurrence of herpes zoster, but the mechanism involved has not been
investigated. This study examined the relationship between major depression and
VZV-specific cellular immunity by comparing VZV-specific responder cell frequency
(RCF) in adults with major depression (n = 11) to that in age- and sex-matched
nondepressed controls (n = 11) and in a larger group of nondepressed adults who
were > or = 60 years old. VZV-specific RCF in depressed patients was markedly
reduced compared with the RCF in matched controls (t = 2.7, P < .02). In fact,
the levels of VZV-specific RCF in the depressed patients were comparable in
magnitude to the low levels found in adults > or = 60 years of age. These data
indicate that major depression is associated with a marked decline in
VZV-specific cellular immunity.
