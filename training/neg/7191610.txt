[IPN virus persistently infected fish cells: studies on growth rates of the cells
and on the replication of egtvedvirus (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Ahne W.

CHSE-214-cells and IPN-virus persistently infected CHSE-cells showed no
differences in morphology and in growth rates. Egtvedvirus was replicated in
IPN-virus persistently infected cells but virus multiplication was about 90%
suppressed compared with the virus yield of standard CHSE-cells.
