Influenza, caused by the influenza virus, is a respiratory infectious disease
that can severely affect human health. Influenza viruses undergo frequent
antigenic changes, thus could spread quickly. Influenza causes seasonal epidemics
and outbreaks in public gatherings such as schools, kindergartens, and nursing
homes. Certain populations are at risk for severe illness from influenza,
including pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and people in any ages
with certain chronic diseases.
