Comparative study of the milk fat globule membrane and the mouse mammary tumour
virus prepared from the milk of an infected strain of Swiss albino mice.

Milk fat globule membranes and mammary tumour virus particles (d=1.17 g/cm3) have
been obtained from the milk of a Swiss albino mice strain. Comparative
biochemistry shows that these two structures differ significantly in the
phospholipid, polypeptide and glycopolypeptide patterns and enzymatic activities.
However, the lipid profile and the morphology of both structures suggest a
filiation with the plasma membrane. Density fractions obtained from the crude
virus preparation have been thoroughly investigated. The results suggest that
most of these fractions represent degraded virus and/or atypical virus assembly.
