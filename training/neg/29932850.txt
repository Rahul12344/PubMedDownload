In late September 2016, the Americas became the first region in the world to have
eliminated endemic transmission of measles virus. Several other countries have
also verified measles elimination, and countries in all six World Health
Organization regions have adopted measles elimination goals. The public health
strategies used to respond to measles outbreaks in elimination settings are thus 
becoming relevant to more countries. This review highlights the strategies used
to limit measles spread in elimination settings: (1) assembly of an outbreak
control committee; (2) isolation of measles cases while infectious; (3) exclusion
and quarantining of individuals without evidence of immunity; (4) vaccination of 
susceptible individuals; (5) use of immunoglobulin to prevent measles in exposed 
susceptible high-risk persons; (6) and maintaining laboratory proficiency for
confirmation of measles. Deciding on the extent of containment efforts should be 
based on the expected benefit of reactive interventions, balanced against the
logistical challenges in implementing them.
