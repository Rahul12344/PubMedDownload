Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a potentially life-threatening fungal infection
usually seen in immunocompromised patients. Pneumocystis jirovecii can be easily 
detected from oral rinse samples in HIV patients with suspected PCP. In this
study, a quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to establish the frequency of 
detection of P. jirovecii in oral rinses from HIV patients without respiratory
symptoms or suspicion of PCP. Two saline oral rinses were collected from 100
ambulant HIV patients and from 60 COPD patients (comparator group). Four HIV
patients were positive for P. jirovecii. In three patients, the first sample was 
positive and in one the second one was positive. One of these patients was on PCP
prophylaxis and had a CD4+ count of 76 cells/mm3. The mean CD4+ count for all
patients was 527 cells/mm3. All qRT-PCR test results for the COPD patients were
negative. No patient developed PCP at six months follow-up. The qRT-PCR assay can
be used to detect P. jirovecii DNA in oral rinse samples from HIV patients
without evident clinical symptoms, however the oral carriage of this fungus was
rare in our cohort of patients. In conclusion, although rare, a positive oral
rinse P. jirovecii result may reflect colonisation, in particular in patients
with HIV. This needs to be kept in mind when using oral rinses and qRT-PCR in the
diagnosis of P. jirovecii infection.
