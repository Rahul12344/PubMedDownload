MDA-7/IL-24 has noteworthy potential as an anticancer therapeutic because of its 
diversity of antitumor properties, its lack of toxicity toward normal cells and
tissues, and its safety and efficacy as evidenced in a phase I clinical trial. In
a recent study, we document that Ad.mda-7-induced ER stress and ceramide
production leads to early autophagy that subsequently switches to apoptosis in
human prostate cancer cells. During the apoptotic phase, the MDA-7/IL-24 protein 
physically interacts with Beclin 1 and this interaction might inhibit Beclin 1
function culminating in apoptosis. Conversely, Ad.mda-7 infection leads to
calpain-mediated cleavage of the Atg5 protein that might also facilitate a
biochemical switch from autophagy to apoptosis. Our recent paper reveals novel
aspects of the interplay between autophagy and apoptosis that underlie the
cytotoxic action of MDA-7/IL-24 in prostate cancer cells. These new insights into
MDA-7/IL-24 action provide intriguing leads for developing innovative
combinatorial approaches for prostate cancer therapy.
