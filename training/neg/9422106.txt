MATRIX HCV, a newly developed semiautomated assay for the detection of antibodies
against individual antigens of the hepatitis C virus, was evaluated on blood
donor specimens and compared with the results of another recombinant immuno-blot 
assay. 399 samples derived from a low-prevalence population revealed an assay
specificity of 99.2% for MATRIX HCV. Investigation of 133 samples with repeat
reactive screening results showed that the MATRIX HCV assay had a higher ability 
to discriminate between a clear reactive and nonreactive result compared to the
recombinant immuno-blot assay.
