Amplification of the long arm of chromosome 8 is one of the most recurrent
findings in prostate cancer and it is associated with poor prognosis. Several
minimal regions of amplification suggest multiple target genes which are yet to
be identified. We have previously shown that TCEB1, EIF3S3, KIAA0196 and RAD21
are amplified and overexpressed in prostate cancer and they are located in the 8q
area. In this study, we examined the functional effects of these genes to
prostate cancer cell phenotype. We overexpressed and inhibited the genes by
lentivirus mediated overexpression and RNA interference, respectively. shRNA
mediated TCEB1 silencing decreased significantly cellular invasion of PC-3 and
DU145 cells through Matrigel. TCEB1 silencing reduced the anchorage-independent
growth of PC-3 cells. Similar effects were not seen with any other genes. When
overexpressed in NIH 3T3 cells, TCEB1 and EIF3S3 increased the growth rate of the
cells. Transcriptional profiling of TCEB1 silenced PC-3 cells revealed decrease
of genes involved in invasion and metastasis. Finally, we also confirmed here the
overexpression of TCEB1 in hormone-refractory prostate tumors. This study
indicates that TCEB1 promotes invasion of prostate cancer cells, is involved in
development of hormone-refractory prostate cancer and is thereby a strong
candidate to be one of the target genes for the 8q gain.
