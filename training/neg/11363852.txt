Needlestick infects nurse with two viruses.

[No authors listed]

AIDS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) documented a case of
simultaneous transmission of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) from a single
needlestick injury. The now-deceased healthcare worker sustained a deep
needlestick injury in July 1990 from an HIV/HCV patient and declined zidovudine
prophylaxis. Eight months later she presented with acute onset hepatitis. This
case raised questions about HIV follow-up since the health care worker
seroconverted after the six-month window used by many hospitals had elapsed.
