The risks of acquisition of hepatitis C infection, the histological spectrum of
liver disease, and the presence of viraemia were investigated in anti-hepatitis C
virus (HCV) antibody positive blood donors. All 357 (0.64%) blood donors to the
South Australian Red Cross Transfusion Service found to have anti-HCV antibody
during the first seven months of testing in 1990 were assessed, and 70 (19.6%)
were found to have elevated alanine transaminase levels. These subjects were
referred for participation in the study; 31 presented for enrollment. Sixteen
(52%) of the 31 patients had previously used intravenous drugs, four (13%) had
been transfused, two (6%) had a history of occupational exposure to blood, and
three (10%) had tattoos and ear-piercing as possible risk factors for acquisition
of hepatitis C. There was no history of parenteral exposure in six (16%). None of
these donors had clinical evidence of liver disease, but in all 24 of the 31 who 
had a liver biopsy there was histological evidence of significant liver damage.
Twelve had evidence of chronic active hepatitis. All 24 subjects biopsied were
viraemic as judged by the presence of HCV RNA in serum.
