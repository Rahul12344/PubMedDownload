The chemokine CXCL10 is crucial for the control of viral replication through the 
regulation of mobilization of antigen-specific T cells to sites of infection.
CXCL10 is highly expressed both at sites of inflammation as well as
constitutively within lymphoid organs by both bone marrow (BM)-derived and
non-BM-derived cells. However, the relative immunologic importance of CXCL10
expressed by these divergent sources relative to HSV-1 infection is unknown.
Using mouse chimeras reconstituted with either wild type or CXCL10 deficient
mouse BM, we show BM-derived, radiation-sensitive cells from wild type mice were 
solely responsible for resistance to HSV-1 in the trigeminal ganglia and brain
stem. The resistance was not reflected by a deficiency in the recruitment of
effector cells to sites of inflammation or expression of chemokines or IFN-gamma 
and likely results from additional, yet-to-be-determined factors emanating from
wild type, BM-derived cells.
