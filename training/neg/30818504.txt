Polyclonal rabbit antisera were produced to the coat protein of Bean golden
mosaic virus Brazil isolate (BGMV), Cabbage leaf curl virus (CabLCV), Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), and Tomato mottle virus (ToMoV), all expressed in
Escherichia coli by the pETh expression vector. The expressed coat protein of
each virus was purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis for use as an immunogen. The antisera to BGMV, CabLCV, TYLCV, and
ToMoV reacted in indirect (plate-trapping) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) with extracts from begomovirus-infected tissue. The antisera to BGMV,
CabLCV, TYLCV, and ToMoV also reacted specifically with the test begomovirus
antigens in leaf imprint blots and Western blots. The CabLCV and TYLCV antisera
were used to detect Bean golden yellow mosaic virus antigens by immunogold
labeling of thin sections of infected bean tissues. In tissue blot immunoassays, 
the TYLCV antiserum reacted well with TYLCV antigens but not with ToMoV antigens,
while CabLCV antiserum reacted well with ToMoV antigens and weakly with TYLCV
antigens. The results indicate that polyclonal antisera prepared to expressed
begomovirus coat proteins were useful for the detection of begomoviruses in an
array of assays.
