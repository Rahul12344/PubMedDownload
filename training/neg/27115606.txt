Epidemiological studies have validated the association between hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An increasing number of
studies show that protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between HCV proteins and
host proteins play a vital role in infection and mediate HCC progression. In this
work, we collected all published interaction between HCV and human proteins,
which include 455 unique human proteins participating in 524 HCV-human
interactions. Then, we construct the HCV-human and HCV-HCC protein interaction
networks, which display the biological knowledge regarding the mechanism of HCV
pathogenesis, particularly with respect to pathogenesis of HCC. Through in-depth 
analysis of the HCV-HCC interaction network, we found that interactors are
enriched in the JAK/STAT, p53, MAPK, TNF, Wnt, and cell cycle pathways. Using a
random walk with restart algorithm, we predicted the importance of each protein
in the HCV-HCC network and found that AKT1 may play a key role in the HCC
progression. Moreover, we found that NS5A promotes HCC cells proliferation and
metastasis by activating AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. This work provides a basis 
for a detailed map tracking new cellular interactions of HCV and identifying
potential targets for HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
