Records of PCR test results for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) were reviewed in
Thailand from 1998 to 2000 for wild Penaeus monodon broodstock purchased by
hatcheries and for post-larvae (PL) brought by farmers to diagnostic laboratories
for testing. Samples for PCR comprised DNA extracts from the last pleopod
dissected from broodstock females after the first spawning and DNA extracts from 
whole, homogenized PL. There was a consistent pattern of fluctuation in
percentage of WSSV-positive broodstock and PL. In broodstock, the fluctuation
pattern was similar each year, with a low percentage (0 to 6%) from January to
May and a higher percentage (6 to 18%) for the rest of the year, with a peak from
September to November. The fluctuation pattern for PL was similar but offset with
peaks and troughs occurring approximately 2 mo after those for the broodstock.
The peak percentages of broodstock-positive samples were roughly constant from
year to year, but those for PL decreased progressively in magnitude from 1998 to 
2000. Examination of a small number of hatcheries in 2000 revealed that the
percentage of WSSV-positive PL samples was significantly lower for hatcheries
that routinely discarded WSSV-PCR-positive wild broodstock when compared to
hatcheries that did not.
