The lytic gene expression of several members of the human herpesvirus family has 
been profiled by using gene-expression microarrays; however, the lytic cascade of
roseoloviruses has not been studied in similar depth. Based on the complete DNA
genome sequences of human herpesvirus 6 variant A (HHV-6A) and variant B
(HHV-6B), we constructed a cDNA microarray containing DNA probes to their
predicted open reading frames, plus 914 human genes. Gene-expression profiling of
HHV-6B strain Z29 in SupT1 cells over a 60 h time-course post-infection, together
with kinetic classification of the HHV-6B genes in the presence of either
cycloheximide or phosphonoacetic acid, allowed the placement of HHV-6B genes into
defined kinetic classes. Eighty-nine HHV-6B genes were divided into four
different expression kinetic classes: eight immediate-early, 44 early, 33 late
and four biphasic. Clustering of genes with similar expression profiles implied a
shared function, thus revealing possible roles of previously uncharacterized
HHV-6B genes.
