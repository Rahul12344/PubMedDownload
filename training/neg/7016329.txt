Cell cycle kinetics of Chinese hamster (CHO) cells treated with the
iron-chelating agent picolinic acid.

Gurley LR, Jett JH.

Spontaneously transformed (tumorigenic) Chinese hamster cells (line CHO) do not
exhibit picolinic acid-sensitive G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest points observed in
normal and virus-transformed cells. Rather, picolinic acid arrests CHO cells in S
phase only and produces culture growth behaviour similar to that produced by
hydroxyurea. Prolonged treatment with picolinic acid permits a slow but
significant traverse of cells through S phase. Thus, like hydroxyurea, picolinic 
acid is not a useful agent for synchronizing exponential CHO cells, but it can be
used to resynchronize cultures in early S phase if a previous synchronization
procedure (such as isoleucine deprivation) is used. The iron chelating properties
of picolinic acid, and the similarities of its effects on cultured cells to those
of hydroxyurea and the iron-chelating drug desferrioxamine, suggest that
picolinic acid inhibits DNA synthesis by interfering with the iron-dependent
production of a stable free organic radical which is essential for the
ribonucleotide reductase formation of deoxyribonucleotides.
