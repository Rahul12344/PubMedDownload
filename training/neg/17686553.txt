In spite of intense efforts no vaccine is yet available that protects against
lentiviral infections. Sheep were immunised eight times over a period of 2.5
years with the maedi-visna (MVV) gag gene on two different vectors, 2 sheep with 
VR1012-gag-CTE and 2 sheep with pcDNA3.1-gag-CTE. All sheep responded to some of 
the mature MVV Gag proteins in Western blot (WB). Three of them responded to the 
virus in lymphocyte proliferation test. The sheep received a boost with
recombinant Gag protein resulting in elevated antibody response. However, when
they were challenged intratracheally with MVV they all became immediately
infected as judged by a strong rise in antibody titer and virus isolation from
blood. It is therefore clear that the vaccination gave no protection. It is even 
possible that it facilitated infectivity since virus was isolated earlier from
all the vaccinated sheep than from any of the unvaccinated sheep infected in the 
same way with the same dose.
