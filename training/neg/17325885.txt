The use of reduced intensity regimens has decreased early mortality following
stem cell transplantation. However, the increased immunosuppression following
these protocols results in profound and often prolonged lymphopenia, resulting in
an increased incidence of viral reactivation. We and others have observed a high 
incidence of EBV viraemia and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) 
following reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, reflecting the delayed
recovery of EBV-specific immunity after such transplants. The clinical and
histological features at presentation are similar to that seen after conventional
intensity conditioning. Given the increasing use of reduced intensity
conditioning (RIC) transplants, we review the risk factors for EBV related
disease following transplantation with RIC, the potential for pre-emptive therapy
of PTLD based on monitoring EBV viraemia and management options in such patients.
