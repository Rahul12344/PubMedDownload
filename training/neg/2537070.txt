A premature male neonate, born at the 25th gestational week, developed pneumonia 
six days after delivery and died. Postmortem examination of the lungs revealed
giant cell pneumonia with intranuclear inclusion bodies; varicella zoster
infection was confirmed by immunoperoxidase stain using monoclonal antibody to
varicella zoster virus and electron microscopic examination. In previously
reported necropsy cases of numerous giant-cell formation in the lung is not
mentioned. Therefore, the unusual features prompting this report include the
absence of skin lesions in this mother and infant and the presence of giant cell 
pneumonia, not previously reported in varicella zoster infection.
