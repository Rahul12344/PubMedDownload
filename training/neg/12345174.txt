[Mortality and health in African towns].

[Article in French]

Antoine P, Ba A.

PIP: An analysis of current conditions concerning health and mortality in the
towns and cities of Sub-Saharan Africa is presented. The authors first examine
mortality differentials between rural and urban areas and their causes. They next
look at intra-urban mortality differentials and health issues in general by
considering health practices, malaria, and AIDS. They use these three approaches 
to sum up the consequences of the current urban health crisis in Africa and to
assess the health status of urban residents in general.
