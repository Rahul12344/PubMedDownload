Since the advent of highly pathogenic variants of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), 
the main focus of avian influenza research has been the characterization and
detection of HPAIV hemagglutinin (HA) from H5 and H7 subtypes. However, due to
the high mutation and reassortation rate of influenza viruses, in theory any
influenza strain may acquire increased pathogenicity irrespective of its subtype.
A comprehensive antigenic characterization of influenza viruses encompassing all 
16 HA and 9 neuraminidase subtypes will provide information useful for the design
of differential diagnostic tools, and possibly, vaccines. We have expressed
recombinant HA proteins from 3 different influenza virus HA subtypes in the
baculovirus system. These proteins were used to generate polyclonal rabbit
antisera, which were subsequently employed in epitope scanning analysis using
peptide libraries spanning the entire HA. Here, we report the identification and 
characterization of linear, HA subtype-specific as well as inter
subtype-conserved epitopes along the HA proteins. Selected subtype-specific
epitopes were shown to be suitable for the differentiation of anti-HA antibodies 
in an ELISA.
