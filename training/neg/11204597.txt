A clinical variant of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, recurrent
lumbosacral HSV, occurs in bedridden hospitalized patients. We want to call
attention to an uncommon pattern of HSV infection in the hospitalized bedridden
patient seen by the dermatology consultation service in a large university
hospital. HSV is characterized by a mixture of recurrent groups of herpetic
vesicles in all stages of development, with multiple, persistent hyperpigmented
patches bilaterally distributed over the lumbosacral (buttocks) area.
