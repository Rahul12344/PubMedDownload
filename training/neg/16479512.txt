Most congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are asymptomatic, but
some lead to severe disease. We hypothesized that differences in disease
manifestations may be partially explained by differences in viral strains. We
recently reported an association between unique long (UL) 144 gene polymorphisms 
and clinical disease. We now report on the sequence heterogeneity of 2 potential 
HCMV virulence genes that encode alpha -chemokines: UL146 and UL147. These 2
genes were highly divergent in cultured isolates obtained from 23 newborns with
congenital HCMV infection and were difficult to categorize. Unlike our findings
for the contiguous UL144 gene, no specific UL146 or UL147 genotype was associated
with disease outcome.
