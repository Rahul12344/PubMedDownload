We developed a model system to study glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated
chromatin remodeling by the BRG1 complex. Introduction of the BRG1 ATPase into
the SW-13 cell line initiates the formation of a functional remodeling complex.
This complex is able to induce transcriptional activation from a transiently
transfected promoter with wild-type and chromatin-remodeling-deficient BRG1
mutants, suggesting that the complex possesses a coactivator function independent
from remodeling. Transactivation from a chromatin template requires the BRG1
remodeling function, which induces regions of hypersensitivity and transcription 
factor loading onto the integrated MMTV promoter. We report that BRG1 remodeling 
activity is required for GR-mediated transactivation and that this activity
cannot be replaced by other ATP-dependent remodeling proteins. Further
characterization of the BRG1-associated factors (BAFs) present in these cells
(for example, the expression of BAF250 but not BAF180) reveals that the BAF
complex rather than the polybromo-associated BAF complex is the necessary and
sufficient chromatin-remodeling component with which the receptor functions in
vivo. These results in conjunction with previous findings demonstrate that the GR
functions with multiple forms of the SWI/SNF complex in vivo.
