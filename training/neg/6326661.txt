Acyclovir and other chemotherapy for herpes group viral infections.

Balfour HH Jr.

The recent profusion of antiviral research has resulted in significant advances
toward prevention and treatment of herpes group virus infections. The most
promising new agent is acyclovir, which is available in topical, intravenous, and
oral formulations. Results of clinical trials of acyclovir for prevention and
treatment of herpes simplex, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and
Epstein-Barr virus infections are discussed, and the potential problem of
antiviral resistance considered. Vidarabine therapy is reviewed briefly, and
future new drugs with activity against herpesviruses are mentioned.
