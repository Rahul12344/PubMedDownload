The incidence of new human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections is declining
and is half of what it was in the mid 1990s. We present a case of newly diagnosed
HIV with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), Neurosyphilis, Kaposi
Sarcoma, and multiple opportunistic infections. Although this type of patient was
not uncommon in the pre-antiretroviral era, we do not often see such a
constellation of conditions in a single individual. The significance of this case
lies not in the diagnosis, but rather in the number of the diagnoses and the
thought process used to attain them.
