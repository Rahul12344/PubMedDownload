Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients frequently present with
elevated levels of serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and/or
aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). This has often been attributed to the hepatic 
effects of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs, including nonnucleoside
reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). A review of cohort studies
investigating the incidence of hepatotoxicity among patients receiving ARV
therapy suggests that the overall rate of ALT and/or AST elevations is similar
among all ARVs. The rate of severe hepatotoxicity, ALT and/or ASTlevels >5 times 
the upper limit of normal (ULN), during therapy with NNRTIs is relatively low but
may be significantly higher in patients with concurrent chronic viral hepatitis
(hepatitis B or C). A comprehensive analysis of 17 randomized clinical trials of 
nevirapine demonstrated that 10% of all nevirapine-treated patients developed
elevated levels of ALT and/or AST >5 times the ULN; however, almost two-thirds
(6.3% of nevirapine-treated patients) of these elevations were asymptomatic.
Symptomatic hepatic events were seen in 4.9% (3.2%-8.9%) of nevirapine-treated
patients.
