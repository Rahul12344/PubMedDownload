Classification of the papillomaviruses--mapping the genome.

Pfister H, Krubke J, Dietrich W, Iftner T, Fuchs PG.

Papillomaviruses form one genus of the Papovaviridae family. They share common
antigenic determinants and their DNAs cross-hybridize under conditions of low
stringency. The classification of papillomaviruses is at present based on the
host range and the relatedness of the nucleic acids. Isolates are considered
independent types if there is less than 50% cross-hybridization in the liquid
phase according to a standard protocol. At least 31 human and six bovine
papillomavirus types can be differentiated on this basis. The host range does not
reflect the natural relationship between the viruses. Subgenera, which differ in 
biological properties, can be distinguished in outline. Data on overall sequence 
homology are insufficient for a meaningful classification because two types of
virus may be closely related within one genome region and rather heterogeneous in
other areas. Some new isolates appear as intermediates between previously
well-separated types and complicate the system. A reasonable classification of
such types of papillomavirus should be based on homologies between genes that are
relevant for differences in the biology of the viruses. A functional mapping of
the rather uniformly organized, colinear genomes of papillomaviruses has been
started. Genetic studies with bovine papillomavirus type 1 have assigned
functions in replication, transformation, gene expression and capsid synthesis to
individual open reading frames.
