OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe rates of and risk factors for complications by
delivery mode among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with CD4 counts
of < or = 500/microL.
STUDY DESIGN: Complication rates were calculated by delivery mode, as follows:
planned cesarean delivery performed without labor or rupture of membranes, other 
cesarean delivery performed after labor or rupture of membranes, or vaginal
delivery. Risk factors were evaluated.
RESULTS: Major complications in the planned cesarean delivery (n = 37), other
cesarean delivery (n = 95), and vaginal delivery (n = 365) groups were amnionitis
or endometritis (16%, 27%, and 7%, respectively), wound infection (5%, 8%, and
<1%, respectively), and transfusion (8%, 6%, and 3%, respectively). Any
peripartum infection occurred among 16 (18%) of those with a CD4 count of
<200/microL and 43 (13%) with a CD4 count of > or =200/microL (P =.17). On
multivariate analyses, factors associated with amnionitis-endometritis were
cesarean delivery and African American race, and a factor associated with
transfusion was third-trimester anemia.
CONCLUSION: Endometritis and wound infection occurred more frequently among human
immunodeficiency virus-infected women after cesarean than among women undergoing 
vaginal delivery; however, complication rates overall were within the range
reported in human immunodeficiency virus-negative women. Measures to decrease
complications in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, such as greater use
of prophylactic antibiotics, should be assessed.
