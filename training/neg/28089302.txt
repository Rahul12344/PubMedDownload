Current HIV vaccines are poor inducers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). A
recent study in Cell Reports used serial fine-needle aspirates from rhesus
macaque lymph nodes following HIV-1 surface envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer
immunization, generating a substantial production of HIV-1 nAbs. A remarkable
correlation was found between antibody titers and a high frequency and ratio of
germinal center B and T follicular helper (TFH) lymphocytes.
