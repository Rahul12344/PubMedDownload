We present a linkage map of intracisternal A-particle (IAP) proviral loci. The
IAP family consists of 2000 endogenous proviral elements that are widely
dispersed in the mouse genome. The map was constructed by using an interspecific 
backcross and markers defined by oligonucleotide probes specific for subclasses
of expressed IAP elements. In genomic DNA from C57BL/6J mouse, these probes each 
detected from 12 to 44 HindIII restriction fragments that represent junctions
between proviral and 5'-flanking DNA. The fragments have characteristic strain
distribution patterns (SDPs) that are particularly polymorphic in the DNAs of
C57BL/6J and Mus spretus mice used for the backcross. IAP loci were placed on the
map by comparison of their distribution patterns with those of known genetic
markers in the backcross. The map includes 51 IAP loci that have not been
previously mapped and 23 IAP proviruses that had been previously mapped in
recombinant inbred (RI) strains. Comparable map positions were obtained with the 
IAP markers in the interspecific backcross and the RI strains. The mapped IAP
loci were widely dispersed on the X Chromosome (Chr) and all of the autosomes
except Chrs 9 and 19, providing useful genetic markers for linkage studies.
