Since the recognition of the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the USA in
1993, interest in hantavirus diseases has intensified worldwide. It is clear that
hantaviruses have been historically responsible for a variety of human illnesses.
Hantaviruses form a separate genus within the Bunyaviridae family. There are
currently >20 recognised sero/genotypes and many others are under investigation. 
Each hantavirus type appears to be specific to a different rodent host. Virus
phylogeny very closely reflects rodent phylogeny. The different hantavirus types 
are associated with different types of disease both in terms of target organs and
disease severity. Two major diseases are recognised: haemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) and HPS. HFRS is primarily a disease of the old world while
HPS is only recognised in the Americas. Over the past few decades the
understanding and recognition of hantavirus disease throughout the world have
greatly expanded. The number of recognised virus types continues to grow, as does
the spectrum of hantavirus disease. There is evidence of hantavirus causing human
disease in the British Isles, but at present it remains a largely uncharacterised
disease.
