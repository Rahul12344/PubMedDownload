Percutaneous injuries such as accidental needle sticks are associated with the
greatest risk for occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens such as
hepatitis B and C viruses and HIV. This article presents data on the risk of
transmission of these viruses after needle sticks, offers strategies for
prevention of injuries from sharp objects, and discusses postexposure prophylaxis
recommendations.
