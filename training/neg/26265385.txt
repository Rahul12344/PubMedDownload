We can now control hepatitis B virus infection by continuously administering
nucleoside and nucleotide analogues such as entecavir and tenofovir. These drugs 
are generally safe and sufficiently effective, but future drugs are needed that
can show off-treatment efficacy--in other words, eradication of latent hepatitis 
B virus DNA (covalently closed circular DNA) in the hepatocytes. This article is 
an overview of new drugs under development and some novel strategies to inhibit
hepatitis B virus proliferation.
