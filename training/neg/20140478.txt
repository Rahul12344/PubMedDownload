Polydnavirus-encoded IkappaB-like proteins are similar to insect and mammalian
IkappaB, and an immunosuppressive function in the host cells has been inferred to
these proteins. Here we show that the expression of one of these IkappaB-like
viral genes, the TnBVank1, in the Drosophila germline affects the localization of
gurken, bicoid, and oskar mRNAs whose gene products are relevant for proper
embryonic patterning. The altered localization of these mRNAs is suggestive of
general defects in the intracellular, microtubule-based, trafficking routes.
Analysis of microtubule motor proteins components such as the dynein heavy chain 
and the kinesin heavy chain revealed defects in the polarized microtubule
network. Interestingly, the TnBVANK1 viral protein is uniformly distributed over 
the entire oocyte cortex, and appears to be anchored to the microtubule ends. Our
data open up a very interesting issue on novel function(s) played by the ank gene
family by interfering with cytoskeleton organization.
