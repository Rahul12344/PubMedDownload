OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence and consequences of adverse reactions among
African HIV-positive pregnant women treated with fixed-dose combinations of a
nevirapine-containing antiretroviral (ARV) triple therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the clinical files of 703 HIV-1-positive
pregnant women treated with a nevirapine-containing regimen between May 2002 and 
July 2004 was conducted. Selection criteria for inclusion in the analysis were:
(a) taking ARV for more than 14 days; (b) baseline values of transaminases below 
the threshold of 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The women were on a
nevirapine-containing regimen for a median of 127 days [interquartile range (IQR)
86-190 days], starting on average at the 27th week of gestation (standard
deviation+/-9.5) and continuing up to a maximum of 6 months after delivery. All
women were offered formula milk to feed the babies. Highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART) was continued beyond 6 months only if the patient qualified on
the first visit. The main outcome measures were incidence of hepatotoxicity, skin
rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Multivariate analysis to assess the impact
of several factors on the adverse reaction rate was performed.
RESULTS: As of 1 August 2004, 554 pregnancies reached term, 96 women were still
pregnant, and 53 women dropped out of the programme before giving birth. After 2 
months of therapy the percentage of patients with a viral load less than 1000
HIV-1 RNA copies/mL increased to 78.6%; average CD4 cell counts increased from
490 cells/microL before therapy to 630 after therapy. The incidence of grade 3-4 
adverse reactions (hepatotoxicity, skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) was 
6.5, 2.4 and 1.1%, respectively. Five women died during pregnancy (0.88%). Only
one of the deaths could be associated with ARV treatment.
CONCLUSION: Nevirapine-containing regimens in pregnant woman, at all CD4 cell
count levels, appear to be safe in African settings.
