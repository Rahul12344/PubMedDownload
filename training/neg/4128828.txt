Antigenic and biochemical characterization of the C-type particle of the stable
porcine kidney cell line PK-15.

Woods WA, Papas TS, Hirumi H, Chirigos MA.

The C-type particles observed by electron microscopy in PK-15 cells were
demonstrated to have biochemical and biophysical properties associated with the
oncornavirus group: density of 1:16 in a sucrose gradient, 70S RNA, and the
RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The group-specific interspecies antigen, gs-3, was 
not present. Evidence of a latent infection with a porcine parvovirus was also
obtained.
