Effect of ribavirin on Rous sarcoma virus transformation.

Jenkins FJ, Chen YC.

Ribavirin inhibited the expression of cellular transformation in normal rat
kidney cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of rous sarcoma virus 
and chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with either a temperature-sensitive
mutant or wild-type Rous sarcoma virus. Ribavirin also inhibited replication of
the Rous sarcoma viruses in chicken embryo fibroblasts. The effect of ribavirin
on cellular transformation was not permanent, as removal of the drug resulted in 
reversion to the transformed phenotype. The concentration of ribavirin necessary 
to inhibit the expression of cellular transformation was cytostatic for the cell 
lines used in this study.
