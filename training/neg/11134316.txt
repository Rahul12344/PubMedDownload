Adenovirus infection inhibits synthesis and processing of rRNA and redistributes 
nucleolar antigens. Adenovirus protein V associates with nucleoli in infected
cells. This study delineates regions of protein V independently capable of
nucleolar targeting. Also, evidence is presented that protein V has the unique
property of relocating nucleolin and B23 to the cytoplasm when transiently
expressed on its own in uninfected cells. Point mutation analysis indicates a
role for the C terminus of protein V in the redirection of nucleolin and B23 to
the cytoplasm. This is the first time an adenovirus protein has been shown to
have a direct effect on nucleolar antigens in isolation from viral infection.
Moreover, adenovirus protein V is the first protein demonstrated to be capable of
redirecting nucleolin and B23 to the cytoplasm.
