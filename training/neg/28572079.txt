BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as treatment for human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is effective and available, but poor
medication adherence limits benefits, particularly in vulnerable populations. In 
a Kenyan randomized controlled trial, a weekly text-messaging intervention
(WelTel) improved cART adherence and HIV viral load (VL). Despite growing
evidence for short message service (SMS) text-message interventions in HIV care, 
there is a paucity of data utilizing these interventions in marginalized or
female cohorts.
OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess whether the standardized WelTel
SMS text-message intervention applied to a vulnerable, predominantly female,
population improved cART adherence and VL.
METHODS: We conducted a repeated measures study of the WelTel intervention in
high-risk HIV-positive persons by measuring change in VL, CD4 count, and
self-reported adherence 12 months before and 12 months after the WelTel
intervention was introduced. Inclusion criteria included VL ≥200 copies/mL,
indication for treatment, and meeting vulnerability criteria. Participants were
given a mobile phone with unlimited texting (where required), and weekly check-in
text messages were sent for one year from the WelTel computer platform. Clinical 
data were collected for control and intervention years. Participants were
followed by a multidisciplinary team in a clinical setting. Outcomes were
assessed using Wilcoxon signed ranks tests for change in CD4 and VL from control 
year to study end and mixed-effects logistic regressions for change in cART
adherence and appointment attendance. A secondary analysis was conducted to
assess the effect of response rate on the outcome by modeling final log10 VL by
number of responses while controlling for mean log10 VL in the control year.
RESULTS: Eighty-five participants enrolled in the study, but 5 withdrew (final
N=80). Participants were predominantly female (90%, 72/80) with a variety of
vulnerabilities. Mean VL decreased from 1098 copies/mL in the control year to 439
copies/mL at study end (P=.004). Adherence to cART significantly improved (OR
1.14, IQR 1.10-1.18; P<.001), whereas appointment attendance decreased slightly
with the intervention (OR 0.81, IQR 0.67-0.99; P=.03). A response was received
for 46.57% (1753/3764) of messages sent and 9.62% (362/3764) of text messages
sent were replied to with a problem. An outcome analysis examining relationship
between reply rate and VL did not meet statistical significance (P=.07), but may 
be worthy of investigating further in a larger study.
CONCLUSIONS: WelTel may be an effective tool for improving cART adherence and
reducing VLs among high-risk, vulnerable HIV-positive persons.
