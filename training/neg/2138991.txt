We have developed a rapid method to investigate the influence of chromosome
supercoiling on gene expression in Escherichia coli K12. This method exploits the
ability of the gem3 mutant of the bacteriophage Mu, even in the prophagic state
in immune cells, to induce relaxation of the host chromosome. The experiments can
thus be performed under physiological conditions, and without the use of the
drugs. In theory, this method can be applied to any bacterial gene. Here, we
report the results obtained with four DNA replication and three cell division
genes.
