OBJECTIVE: To determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
in several groups of populations in Durango City, Mexico.
METHODS: An observational and comparative study was conducted in 6 groups of
population in a total of 775 persons in Durango City, Mexico. The groups studied 
were 141 registered female sex workers, 100 medical students, 150 blood donors,
104 persons applying for medical certificates, 100 pregnant women, and 180 drug
addicts. Serum samples of participants were analyzed for HBsAg by an immunoassay.
HBsAg confirmation was performed by neutralization assay.
RESULTS: Out of the 775 participants, 13 (1.7%) were positive by the immunoassay,
and only 1 (0.1%) resulted positive by the confirmatory assay. This positive case
was a drug addict and had a history of surgery and national and international
trips.
CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of HBsAg in several groups of population in
Durango City is low; the seroprevalence is comparable to or lower than those
informed in other Mexican cities. It is strongly recommended to perform the HBsAg
confirmation test due to low specificity of the immunoassay.
