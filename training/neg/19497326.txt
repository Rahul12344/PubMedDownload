Neospora caninum is a protozoan parasite that causes abortion in cattle around
the world. Although the clinical signs of disease in both dogs and cattle have
now been recognised for over 20years, treatment and control options are still
limited, despite the availability of a commercial vaccine in some countries of
the world. The case for an efficacious vaccine has not been convincingly waged by
farmers, veterinarians and other members of the agricultural and rural
communities. In recent times, however, economic modelling has been used to
estimate the industry losses due to Neospora-associated abortion, providing, in
turn, the business case for forms of control for this parasite, including the
development of vaccines. In this review, we document progress in all areas of the
vaccine development pipeline, including live, killed and recombinant forms and
the animal models available for vaccine evaluation. In addition, we summarise the
main outcomes on the economics of Neospora control and suggest that the current
boom in the global dairy industry increases the specific need for a vaccine
against N. caninum-associated abortion.
