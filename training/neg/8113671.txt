Bacterial and retroviral superantigens (SAGs) interact with major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and stimulate T cells upon
binding to the V beta portion of the T cell receptor. Whereas both types of
molecules exert similar effects on T cells, they have very different primary
structures. Amino acids critical for the binding of bacterial toxins to class II 
molecules have been identified but little is known of the molecular interactions 
between class II and retroviral SAGs. To determine whether both types of
superantigens interact with the same regions of MHC class II molecules, we have
generated mutant HLA-DR molecules which have lost the capacity to bind three
bacterial toxins (Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin A [SEA], S. aureus
enterotoxin B [SEB], and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 [TSST-1]). Cells expressing
these mutated class II molecules efficiently presented two retroviral SAGs (Mtv-9
and Mtv-7) to T cells while they were unable to present the bacterial SAGs. These
results demonstrate that the binding sites for both types of SAGs can be
dissociated.
