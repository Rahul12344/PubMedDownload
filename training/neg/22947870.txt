Calmodulin (CaM) expression is upregulated upon HIV-1 infection and interacts
with proteins involved in viral processing, including the multifunctional HIV-1
MA protein. We present here the results of studies utilizing small-angle neutron 
scattering with contrast variation that, when considered in the light of earlier 
fluorescence and NMR data, show CaM binds MA in an extended open-clamp
conformation via interactions with two tryptophans that are widely spaced in
sequence and space. The interaction requires a disruption of the MA tertiary fold
such that MA becomes highly extended in a long snakelike conformation. The CaM-MA
interface is extensive, covering ~70% of the length of the MA such that regions
known to be important in MA interactions with critical binding partners would be 
impacted. The CaM conformation is semiextended and as such is distinct from the
classical CaM-collapse about short α-helical targets. NMR data show that upon
dissociation of the CaM-MA complex, either by the removal of Ca(2+) or increasing
ionic strength, MA reforms its native tertiary contacts. Thus, we observe a high 
level of structural plasticity in MA that may facilitate regulation of its
activities via intracellular Ca(2+)-signaling during viral processing.
