An informative, with simple instrument needed, rapid and easily updated strategy 
for the identification of insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) rice has
been described. Such strategy is based on a parallel series of loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP) reactions targeting the rice endogenous gene
sucrose phosphate synthase (Sps), the top two most frequently used genetic
elements (Agrobacterium tumefaciens nopaline synthase terminator (Nos) and
Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S)), and an insect-resistant
specific gene (Cry1Ac) and detected visually by phosphate ion (Pi)-induced
coloration reaction. After a logical judgment of visible readouts has been
obtained, three popular insect-resistant GM rice events in China can be
successfully identified within 35 min, using either microwell strips or paper
bases.
