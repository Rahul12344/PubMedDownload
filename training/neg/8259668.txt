A series of linker scanning and deletion mutations has been constructed in the 5'
leader sequence of HIV-1. One virus with a 13-base-linker substitution upstream
of the 5' major splice site was as impaired in its ability to replicate as a
virus with a large deletion, which included these 13 bases, and was less
efficient in packaging its genomic RNA than viruses carrying mutations between
the 5' major splice site and the gag translation initiation site. These
observations have led to the identification of a conserved pattern of repeated
sequence elements associated with sequences experimentally defined as necessary
for encapsidation of Moloney murine leukemia virus, spleen necrosis virus, avian 
leukosis-sarcoma viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
