Cuba's accomplishments in primary care, while controversial, include several
developments pertinent to family medicine. These accomplishments involve
low-technology and organizational innovations such as neighborhood-based family
medicine as the focus of primary care; regionalized systems of hospital services 
and professional training; innovative public health initiatives and epidemiologic
surveillance; universal access to services without substantial barriers related
to race, social class, gender, and age; and active programs in treatments such as
"green medicine" and "thermalism." High-technology achievements include
innovations in pharmacology and biotechnology, surgical procedures, and care of
patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Limited access to
Cuban publications, impediments to presentations by Cuban health care
professionals at professional meetings, and the prohibition on importing products
of Cuban biotechnology to the United States inhibit a detached, scientific
appraisal of Cuba's accomplishments. Cuba's isolation from the US clinical and
research communities has prevented interchanges that would improve primary care
services in both countries.
