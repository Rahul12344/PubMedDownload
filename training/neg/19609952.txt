We investigated short-term persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
among 2,408 women with low-grade or equivocal cytological abnormalities followed 
for 24 months. Odds ratios (ORs) for persistence to the next 6-month visit were
estimated by a discrete time survival model. Prevalent HPV infections persisted
longer in older women, but no association with age was found for incident HPV
infections. Increased likelihood of persistence was found among current smokers
of >20 cigarettes per day compared with smokers of <or=10 cigarettes per day
(OR=1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.01) and among current injectable
contraceptive users (OR=1.15; 95% CI: 1.01-1.32). Persistence was more likely
among infections with higher viral load (OR=2.05; 95% CI: 1.65-2.53) or with
concurrent cytological abnormalities (OR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.03-1.39 and 1.29; 95%
CI: 0.99-1.70 for ASCUS/LSIL and ASC-H/HSIL, respectively). We conclude that new 
HPV infections in older women are not riskier by the metric of viral persistence 
than those in younger women. Other risk factors such as oral contraceptive use
and multiparity that have been associated with cervical cancer or cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 were not associated with short-term HPV
persistence.
