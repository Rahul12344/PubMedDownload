A phylogenetic tree constructed by the unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic means (UPGMA) for the VP8* gene from 13 human and two feline rotavirus
strains possessing the AU-1 gene 4 allele revealed that these strains could be
classified into two clusters which did not correspond with the year of isolation 
or the host species from which they originated. Nine of 10 human strains and one 
feline strain isolated in Japan formed one cluster, whereas three human strains
from Italy and one feline strain from Australia formed the other. Human strain K8
from Japan was distantly related to the Australo-European clustering.
