In vitro infection studies with infectious laryngotracheitis virus.

Calnek BW, Fahey KJ, Bagust TJ.

Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus strains were studied for their ability
to infect chicken macrophages, lymphocytes, and kidney cells in vitro. Although
macrophages were as susceptible as chicken kidney cells to infection, replication
of most virus strains in macrophages was markedly restricted. Only a few isolates
induced progressive infections in macrophages, and even with these the donor of
the macrophages influenced replication. Thus, it appears that both cell genotype 
and virus genotype may help determine the extent of restriction of virus
replication. Macrophages were more susceptible to an attenuated vaccine strain of
ILT virus than to virulent virus strains. Spleen lymphocytes, peripheral blood
lymphocytes, thymocytes, bursal lymphocytes, buffy coat leukocytes, and activated
T-cells were nearly or totally refractory to infection by ILT virus.
