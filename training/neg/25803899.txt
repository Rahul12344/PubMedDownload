OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of gp96 raised during hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection and the pathological mechanism.
METHODS: The mechanism of NF-KB activating gp96 expression was determined by
bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, real-time PCR and Western
blot. The effect of over-expression and knockdown gp96 expression by transfection
or RNA interference on hepatocyte proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle was
examined by CCK-8 and flow cytometry. The role of gp96 for HCC development was
determined by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and colony formation assay.
RESULTS: NF-kB significantly increased the gp96 expression by binding to the
NF-kappaB binding site. Over-expression and knockdown studies both show that gp96
promoted hepatocyte proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and induced G0/G1 to S
phase cell cycle progression. Moreover, gp96 induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition and increased colony formation ability of hepatocytes.
CONCLUSION: Our results therefore provide insights in chronic HBV
infection-induced gp96 expression, and indicate that elevated gp96 may contribute
to HCC development during chronic inflammation.
