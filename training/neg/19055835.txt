BACKGROUND: The progression of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection is influenced by host and viral factors. Distinct clinical 
outcomes in patients infected with different HCV genotypes have been described in
the literature. However, the association between specific HCV genotype and
clinical outcome remains unclear. We set out to study the natural history of HCV 
genotype 1 and 3 infections in Campinas, São Paulo state, Brazil, focusing on
epidemiological, clinical, biochemical, and histological characteristics.
METHODS: Patients with HCV infection referred for treatment between January 2003 
and December 2006 were included in this study. We collected epidemiological,
clinical, and laboratorial data using standard forms.
RESULTS: A total of 283 patients were included; genotype 1 was identified in 163 
(57.6%) patients, genotype 3 in 112 (39.6%), genotype 2 in 7 (2.5%), and genotype
4 in 1 (0.35%). Patients with genotype 2 and 4 were excluded from analysis.
Multivariate analysis showed that intravenous energetic drug, positive
cryoglobulin, and cirrhosis were independently and significantly associated with 
HCV genotype 3 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Genotype 3 currently seems to be associated with intravenous
energetic drug, high frequency of cryoglobulinemia, and advanced liver disease in
our region. Understanding the distribution of the different HCV genotypes can
elucidate transmission of HCV and support optimal prevention strategies.
