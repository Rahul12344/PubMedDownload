OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors for residual lesion in hysterectomy
specimens after loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical
intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 594
patients who underwent total hysterectomy after LEEP for CIN at the International
Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong
University between July 2006 and June 2015. Among the 594 patients, there were no
residual lesions in uterine specimens of 409 (68.9%) patients; residual CIN1 was 
found in 24 (4%) patients, CIN2 and CIN3 in 142 (23.9%) patients, and cervical
cancer in 19 (3.2%) patients. On univariate analysis age, menopausal status,
margin involvement, lesion grade, abnormal endocervical curettage (ECC) result,
and persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection post operation were
significantly associated with residual lesions after LEEP (P < 0.05).
Multivariate regression analysis using the logistic regression model showed
abnormal ECC result and persistent HPV positivity to be independent risk factors 
for residual lesions after LEEP. LEEP with positive margins and persistent HPV
infection were also associated with high risk of invasive cervical cancer in
CIN2+ patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal ECC result and post-treatment HPV infection are predictors 
of residual lesion after LEEP. In combination, they could be useful for risk
stratification and selection of the management approach. Postmenopausal CIN2+
patients with positive margins and persistent postoperative HPV infection may
have high risk of cervical invasive cancer.
