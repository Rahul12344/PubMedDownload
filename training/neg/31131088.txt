Marburgviruses are closely related to ebolaviruses and cause a devastating
disease in humans. In 2012, we published a comprehensive review of the first 45
years of research on marburgviruses and the disease they cause, ranging from
molecular biology to ecology. Spurred in part by the deadly Ebola virus outbreak 
in West Africa in 2013-2016, research on all filoviruses has intensified. Not
meant as an introduction to marburgviruses, this article instead provides a
synopsis of recent progress in marburgvirus research with a particular focus on
molecular biology, advances in animal modeling, and the use of Egyptian fruit
bats in infection experiments.
