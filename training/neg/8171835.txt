Toxoplasmosis was diagnosed in a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) found
moribund in Lake Loundes Park, Mississippi. There was almost total necrosis of
mesenteric lymph nodes, focal hemorrhage and necrosis in the brain. Lesions in
all of these organs were associated with numerous Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites. 
Tissue cysts were seen in the brain. Organisms reacted with anti-T. gondii serum 
in an avidin-biotin immunohistochemical test. There was no evidence of concurrent
distemper or rabies virus infection. Hammondia heydorni-like schizonts and
gamonts were seen in sections of intestinal epithelium.
