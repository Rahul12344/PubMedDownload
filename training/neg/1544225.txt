The prefemoral efferent lymphatics of sheep persistently infected (PI) with
Border disease virus (BDV) were cannulated in order to study the effects of the
virus on cells of the immune system. Efferent lymphocytes recovered from PI sheep
were phenotyped using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) specific for ovine 
cell-surface markers and compared to lymphocytes recovered from normal, healthy
controls. PI sheep had an increased percentage of cells expressing the T
cell-associated molecules CD5, CD4, CD8 and T19, also an increase in cells
expressing CD1 and a population of cells expressing low levels of the T19
molecule which was not present in control sheep. The lymphocytes were examined
for the presence of BDV using virus-specific MoAb. On average 8.5% of the
efferent lymphocytes from PI sheep carried virus antigen. BDV antigen was also
found in the mononuclear cells and connective tissue of lymph nodes indicating
widespread virus dissemination within the lymphoid system of PI sheep.
