RATIONALE: Regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) is a brain-enriched negative
modulator of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. Decreased availability of RGS4
in the frontal cortex and striatum has been described in animal models of
schizophrenia and drug addiction. However, cellular and behavioral consequences
of dysregulated RGS4-dependent receptor signaling in the brain remain poorly
understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether RGS4, through inhibiting the
function of mGluR5 receptors in the dorsal striatum (dSTR), regulates cellular
and behavioral responses to acute amphetamine.
METHODS: After herpes simplex virus-RGS4 was infused into the dSTR, RGS4
overexpression as well as binding of recombinant RGS4 to mGluR5 was assessed. The
effect of RGS4 overexpression on behavioral activity induced by the intrastriatal
mGluR5 agonist, DHPG, or amphetamine was recorded. Activation of extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt (protein kinase B) was measured in the dSTR
tissue at the end of each behavioral experiment.
RESULTS: RGS4 overexpressed in the dSTR coimmunoprecipitated with mGluR5
receptors and suppressed both behavioral activity and phospho-ERK levels induced 
by DHPG. RGS4 overexpression or the mGluR5 antagonist,
3-((2-methyl-4-thiazolyl)ethynyl)pyridine (MTEP), attenuated amphetamine-induced 
phospho-ERK (but not phospho-Akt) levels. RGS4 suppressed amphetamine-induced
vertical activity and augmented horizontal activity over 90Â min. Similarly, MTEP 
augmented amphetamine-induced horizontal activity, but did not affect vertical
activity.
CONCLUSIONS: The present data demonstrate that RGS4 in the dSTR attenuates
amphetamine-induced ERK signaling and decreases the behavioral efficacy of acute 
amphetamine likely by limiting mGluR5 function.
