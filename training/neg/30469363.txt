Despite recent advances in curative therapy, hepatitis C virus (HCV) still
remains a global threat. In order to achieve global elimination, a prophylactic
vaccine should be considered high priority. Previous immunogens used to induce
broad neutralising antibodies (BnAbs) have been met with limited success. To
improve immunogen design, factors associated with the early development of BnAbs 
in natural infection must first be understood. In this study, 43 subjects
identified with acute HCV were analysed longitudinally using a panel of
heterogeneous HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp), to understand the emergence of BnAbs. 
Compared to those infected with a single genotype, early BnAb development was
associated with subjects co-infected with at least 2 HCV subtypes during acute
infection. In those that were mono-infected, BnAbs were seen to emerge with
increasing viral persistence. If subjects acquired a secondary infection, nAb
breadth was seen to boost upon viral re-exposure. Importantly, this data
highlights the potential for multivalent and prime-boost vaccine strategies to
induce BnAbs against HCV in humans. However, the data also indicate that the
infecting genotype may influence the development of BnAbs. Therefore, the choice 
of antigen will need to be carefully considered in future vaccine trials.
