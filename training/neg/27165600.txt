A hepatitis E outbreak, which occurred on a small isolated island, provided an
opportunity to evaluate the association between the number of hepatitis E cases
in the community and the concentration of virus detected in sewage. Samples were 
collected from the different sewage treatment plants from the island and analyzed
for the presence of hepatitis E (HEV) virus using real-time RT-PCR. We
demonstrated that if 1-4 % of inhabitants connected to a WWTP were infected with 
HEV, raw sewage contained HEV at detectable levels. The finding that such a small
number of infected people can contaminate municipal sewage works raises the
potential of the further distribution of the virus. Indeed, investigating the
routes of transmission of HEV, including the potential for sewage effluent to
contain infectious HEV, may help us to better understand the epidemiology of this
pathogen, which is considered to be an emerging concern in Europe.
