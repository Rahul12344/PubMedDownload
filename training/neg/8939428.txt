Salmonella enterica serovar blegdam has a restriction and modification system
encoded by genes linked to serB. We have cloned these genes, putative alleles of 
the hsd locus of Escherichia coli K-12, and confirmed by the sequence
similarities of flanking DNA that the hsd genes of S. enterica serovar blegdam
have the same chromosomal location as those of E. coli K-12 and Salmonella
enterica serovar typhimurium LT2. There is, however, no obvious similarity in
their nucleotide sequences, and while the gene order in S. enterica serovar
blegdam is serB hsdM, S and R, that in E. coli K-12 and S. enterica serovar
typhimurium LT2 is serB hsdR, M and S. The hsd genes of S. enterica serovar
blegdam identify a third family of serB-linked hsd genes (type ID). The
polypeptide sequence predicted from the three hsd genes show some similarities
(18-50% identity) with the polypeptides of known and putative type I restriction 
and modification systems; the highest levels of identity are with sequences of
Haemophilus influenzae Rd. The HsdM polypeptide has the motifs characteristic of 
adenine methyltransferases. Comparisons of the HsdR sequence with those for three
other families of type I systems and three putative HsdR polypeptides identify
two highly conserved regions in addition to the seven proposed DEAD-box motifs.
