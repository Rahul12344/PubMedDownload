Six strains of bovid herpesvirus 1 isolated from British cases of infectious
bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) were inoculated intranasally into calves. The
clinical, virological and serological responses were measured and comparisons
made between virus strains. Calves infected with viruses of subtype 1 developed
more severe clinical signs and excreted higher titres of virus than calves
infected with subtype 2b strains. The findings could be related to the history of
IBR in Great Britain.
