The role of gene A protein and E. coli rep protein in the replication of phi X
174 replicative form DNA.

Eisenberg S.

The gene A protein of bacteriophage phi X 174 initiates replication of
super-twisted RFI DNA by cleaving the viral (+) strand at the origin of
replication and binding to the 5' end. Upon addition of E. coli rep protein
(single-stranded DNA dependent ATPase), E. coli single-stranded DNA binding
protein and ATP, complete unwinding of the two strands occurs. Electron
microscopic analyses of intermediates in the reaction reveal that the unwinding
occurs by movement of the 5' end into the duplex, displacing the viral strand in 
the form of a single-stranded loop. Since unwinding will not occur in the absence
of either gene A protein or rep protein, it is presumed that the rep protein
interacts to form a complex with the bound gene A protein. Single-stranded DNA
binding protein facilitates the unwinding by binding to the exposed
single-stranded DNA. Further addition of the four deoxyribotriphosphates and DNA 
polymerase III holoenzyme to the reaction results in synthesis of viral (+)
single-stranded circles in amounts exceeding that of the input template. A model 
describing the role of gene A protein and rep protein in duplex DNA replication
is presented and other properties of gene A protein discussed.
