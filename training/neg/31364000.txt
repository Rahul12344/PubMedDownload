PURPOSE: To assess the association between benign ovarian tumors and subsequent
risk of breast cancer, and to examine this association according to type of
benign ovarian tumors.
METHODS: This nationwide cohort study comprised all Danish women diagnosed with a
benign ovarian tumor during 1978-2016 (n = 158,221) identified through the Danish
National Patient Register. The cohort was linked to the Danish Cancer Registry to
identify all cases of breast cancer, and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.
RESULTS: Overall, women with a benign ovarian tumor were at significantly
increased risk of breast cancer. The risk was confined to women with a solid
ovarian tumor (SIR 1.09; 95% CI 1.05-1.13), particularly in women ≥ 50 years at
benign tumor diagnosis (SIR 1.19; 95% CI 1.12-1.26). The risk remained increased 
up to 20 years or more after the diagnosis of a solid ovarian tumor (SIR 1.11;
95% CI 1.04-1.18), and women with a solid tumor were at increased risk of ductal,
lobular, and other types of breast cancer, although most consistent for the
lobular subtype. For cystic tumors, this association was confined to ductal
breast cancer in women with the tumor diagnosed at age ≥ 50 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Women with a benign ovarian tumor were at increased risk of breast
cancer. This association was largely confined to women with a solid ovarian
tumor, and the excess risk was present 20 years or more after the ovarian tumor
diagnosis. The underlying mechanism is unknown and should be investigated
further.
