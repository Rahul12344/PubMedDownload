Inhibition of polyclonally induced immunoglobulin secretion by aurothiomalate.

Petersen J.

The influence of sodium aurothiomalate on the secretion of immunoglobulins by
normal human lymphocytes in vitro was investigated by means of a reverse
hemolytic plaque forming cell (PFC) assay. Aurothiomalate inhibited the PFC
response induced by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in a
dose dependent manner. The inhibition was irreversible, as pre-incubation for 2 h
with the drug followed by extensive washing and further culture in gold salt-free
medium still caused an inhibition of the PFC response to PWM and to EBV. Cell
proliferation was not significantly affected, suggesting that the inhibition of
PFC formation was not due to cytotoxicity. Pre-incubation of
monocytes/macrophages (Mø's), T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes with the gold
compound prior to culture with PWM showed that Mø's and B cells were highly
sensitive, whereas T lymphocytes were resistant to the drug. The findings
indicate that aurothiomalate inhibits the polyclonally induced PFC response by
interfering with accessory Mø function and by affecting the B lymphocyte itself.
