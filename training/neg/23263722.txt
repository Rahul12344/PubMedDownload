The synthesis of designer solid-state materials by living organisms is an
emerging field in bio-nanotechnology. Key examples include the use of engineered 
viruses as templates for cobalt oxide (Co(3)O(4)) particles, superparamagnetic
cobalt-platinum alloy nanowires and gold-cobalt oxide nanowires for photovoltaic 
and battery-related applications. Here, we show that the earthworm's metal
detoxification pathway can be exploited to produce luminescent, water-soluble
semiconductor cadmium telluride (CdTe) quantum dots that emit in the green region
of the visible spectrum when excited in the ultraviolet region. Standard
wild-type Lumbricus rubellus earthworms were exposed to soil spiked with CdCl(2) 
and Na(2)TeO(3) salts for 11 days. Luminescent quantum dots were isolated from
chloragogenous tissues surrounding the gut of the worm, and were successfully
used in live-cell imaging. The addition of polyethylene glycol on the surface of 
the quantum dots allowed for non-targeted, fluid-phase uptake by macrophage
cells.
