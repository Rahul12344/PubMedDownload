BACKGROUND: Limited photoinactivation kinetics, use of low-volume 30 percent Hct 
RBCs, and hemolysis have restricted the practicality of the use of
dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) and light for RBC decontamination. A flow-cell
system was developed to rapidly treat larger volumes of oxygenated 45 percent Hct
RBCs with high-intensity red light.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: CPD-whole blood was WBC reduced, RBCs were diluted in
additive solutions (either Adsol or Erythrosol), and suspensions were
subsequently oxygenated by gas overlay. Intracellular or extracellular VSV and
DMMB were sequentially added. VSV-infected RBC suspensions (45% Hct) were passed 
through 1-mm-thick flow cells and illuminated. Samples were titered for VSV,
stored for up to 42 days, and assayed for Hb, supernatant potassium, ATP, and
MCV.
RESULTS: The use of oxygenated RBCs resulted in rapid and reproducible
photoinactivaton of > or = 6.6 log extracellular and approximately 4.0 log
intracellular VSV independent of additive solution. Phototreated Adsol RBCs
exhibited more than 10 times greater hemolysis and 30 percent greater MCV during 
storage than identically treated Erythrosol RBCs. Phototreatment caused RBC
potassium leakage from RBCs in both additive solutions. ATP levels were better
preserved in Erythrosol than Adsol RBCs.
CONCLUSION: A rapid, reproducible, and robust method for photoinactivating model 
virus in RBC suspensions was developed. Despite improved hemolysis and ATP levels
in Erythrosol-phototreated RBCs, storage properties were not maintained for 42
days.
