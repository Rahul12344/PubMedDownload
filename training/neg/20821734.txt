The transactivator protein Tat of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is 
known to suppress microtubule dynamics and thereby trigger apoptosis in T
lymphocytes. These actions of Tat constitute one of the major mechanisms for the 
massive destruction of T lymphocytes associated with the acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome. Herein, we show that Tat acetylation at lysine-28
(K28) enhances its interaction with microtubules and increases its activity to
promote microtubule assembly, by lowering the critical concentration of tubulin
for polymerization into microtubules. In addition, K28 acetylation enhances the
ability of Tat to stabilize microtubules, leading to increased apoptosis in T
lymphocytes. Our data further reveal that Tat acetylation at K28 stimulates its
activity to induce the translocation of Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2
family, from microtubules to mitochondria. These findings provide the first
evidence that Tat acetylation regulates its actions on microtubule dynamics and
apoptosis, in addition to the regulation of its transactivation activity.
