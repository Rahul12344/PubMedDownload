Adenovirus 36 (Ad36) is known to be associated with human obesity and to trigger 
inflammation in murine models. However, to date no clinical drugs for treating
virus-induced obesity have been developed. Therefore, in this study, the
anti-obesity and anti-inflammation effects of mulberry extract on Ad36 were
evaluated in mice. The mulberry extract-fed group showed a reduction in total
body weight and in epidermal fat pads. A combination of various mulberry
components (1-deoxynojirimycin, kuromanin chloride and resveratrol) and a
mulberry extract prevented viral replication by 50% and 70%, respectively,
compared with an untreated Ad36-infected group. Moreover, the extract decreased
both concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as MCP-1 and TNF-α, and
the numbers of infiltrating immune cells and macrophages in epidermal fat pads.
In conclusion, dietary mulberry extract might offer an avenue for the development
of therapeutic approaches for treating or preventing virus-induced obesity and
inflammation-related metabolic diseases.
