Reverse transcriptase-dependent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to
the detection and differentiation of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)
and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) using primer pairs designed
for the amplification of glycoprotein G-specific gene fragments of the two
viruses. The products of 443 bp (VHS) and 548 bp (IHN), respectively, were
amplified from the total RNA extracts of RTG-2 cells infected with a total of 9
different strains of either VHS virus or IHN virus. Restriction analysis using
FokI, and DNA sequencing of the PCR products demonstrated specificity of the
amplification. The RT-PCR amplification of VHSV or IHNV G-genes was found to be a
simple, highly specific and sensitive method allowing differential diagnosis of
VHS and IHN within 8 h.
