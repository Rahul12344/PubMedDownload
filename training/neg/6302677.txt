Association of pp36, a phosphorylated form of the presumed target protein for the
src protein of Rous sarcoma virus, with the membrane of chicken cells transformed
by Rous sarcoma virus.

Amini S, Kaji A.

A cellular protein with a molecular mass of approximately 36 kilodaltons is the
presumed target protein of the src protein [the transforming protein encoded by
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV)]. The cellular location of the phosphorylated
36-kilo-dalton protein (pp36) in chicken embryo fibroblasts transformed by the
Schmidt-Ruppin strain of RSV has been investigated. In these studies,
two-dimensional electrophoresis was used for detection of the phosphoproteins in 
total cell extracts and also in fractionated subcellular components. We conclude 
that pp36 is localized in the plasma membrane, on the basis of the following
observations. (i) Fractionation of 32P-labeled cell extracts showed that pp36 is 
almost exclusively localized in the crude membrane fraction and no appreciable
amount was found in nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions. (ii) On further
fractionation of the crude membrane fraction, pp36 was localized mostly in the
plasma membrane rather than in other membranous fractions. (iii) Isolated plasma 
membrane by itself phosphorylated the 36-kilodalton protein on incubation with
[gamma-32P]ATP.
