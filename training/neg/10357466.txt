HIV-1 group O has its epicenter in Cameroon and neighboring countries and is
responsible for 3 to 5% of all HIV infections in this region. It is believed that
HIV-1 group O was introduced into the human population by a separate
cross-species transmission, occurring independently of the HIV-1 (group M and
group N) and HIV-2 transmissions. We have studied the coreceptor requirements of 
12 primary HIV-1 O-type isolates from individuals with different clinical
symptoms. Only 2 of these 12 viruses showed a syncytium-inducing phenotype after 
infection of primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and were
infectious for the T cell line C8166. These isolates used CXCR4 as a coreceptor
for entry, whereas the remaining isolates used only CCR5 efficiently. One isolate
was able to use BOB and CCR8 as coreceptors in addition to CXCR4. All group O
isolates tested were efficiently inhibited by SDF-1 or RANTES, the natural
ligands of CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively. These results indicate that CXCR4 and
CCR5 are the principal coreceptors for HIV-1 O-type viruses. Most of the HIV-1
group O isolates studied were derived from patients at later stages of the
disease. Although HIV-1 group O and group M infections do not differ in their
pathogenesis, the studied isolates did not evolve to use a broad range of
coreceptors as described for HIV-1 group M and HIV-2.
