Adult germfree (Gf) mice with undeveloped immune system due to antigen deficient 
environment, conventional (Cv) mice with normal immune system and Cv suckling
mice with undeveloped immune system due to age were treated intraperitoneally
with Mannozym (M, 0.1% zymosan suspension) 4 days or 4 days and 1 day before the 
intracerebral inoculation with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). One
dose of M was equal to 40 mg/kg of zymosan. In suckling mice, both applied doses 
of M contributed the development of fatal lymphocytic choriomeningitis after
infection with 100 LD50 dose of LCMV, thus M pretreatment increased the cellular 
immune response to LCMV infection. M pretreatments had no influence on the course
of LCMV infection either in adult Gf or in Cv mice. Spleen hypertrophy was caused
by applied doses of M both in adult (Gf and Cv) and Cv suckling mice, but
modulating effect on the cellular immune response manifested simultaneously only 
in Cv sucklings.
