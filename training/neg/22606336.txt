The ferret is commonly used as a model for studies of infectious diseases. The
genomic sequence of this animal model is not yet characterized, and only a
limited number of fully annotated cDNAs are currently available in GenBank. The
majority of genes involved in innate or adaptive immune response are still
lacking, restricting molecular genetic analysis of host response in the ferret
model. To enable de novo identification of transcriptionally active ferret genes 
in response to infection, we performed de-novo transcriptome sequencing of
animals infected with H1N1 A/California/07/2009. We also included splenocytes
induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide to allow for identification of
transcripts specifically induced by gram-negative bacteria. We pooled and
normalized the cDNA library in order to delimit the risk of sequencing only
highly expressed genes. While normalization of the cDNA library removes the
possibility of assessing expression changes between individual animals, it has
been shown to increase identification of low abundant transcripts. In this study,
we identified more than 19,000 partial ferret transcripts, including more than
1000 gene orthologs known to be involved in the innate and the adaptive immune
response.
