Four new flavones, tobaflavones E-H (1-4), together with two known flavones (5
and 6), were isolated from the leaves of Dali Tiandeng tobacco (a variety of
Yunnan local air cured tobacco). Their structures were elucidated by
spectroscopic methods, including extensive 1D- and 2D NMR techniques. Compound 2 
is the first naturally occurring flavone bearing a
(4-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-oxo-2H-pyran-3-yl)methyl moiety. These compounds were also 
evaluated for their anti-tobacco mosaic virus (anti-TMV) activity. The results
revealed that compounds 1 and 2 exhibited high anti-TMV activity with inhibition 
rate of 35.3% and 39.6%, respectively. The rates are higher than those of
positive control. The other compounds also showed potential anti-TMV activity
with inhibition rates in the range of 18.7-28.4%, respectively.
