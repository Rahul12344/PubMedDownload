Since hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of posttransfusional
non-A, non-B hepatitis, is a positive stranded RNA virus, it is supposed to
replicate via a negative RNA strand. Although strand specific reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was recently developed to
detect each strand of HCV RNA, the specificity of the strategy has remained to be
determined. In this study, using in vitro transcribed positive and negative
stranded HCV RNAs mixed with hepatic cellular RNA from normal liver, we found
that this strategy did not distinguish between the two RNA strands, but that
chemical modification of RNA samples at the 3' end followed by strand specific
RT-PCR made specific detection possible. Liver tissues, sera and peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ten patients with chronic HCV infection were
analyzed with the novel strategy of RT-PCR combined with RNA modification.
Positive and negative strands of HCV RNA were detected in liver tissues of ten
(100%) and nine (90%) cases, respectively. Negative RNA strand was detected also 
in sera of five cases (50%), positive strand being detected in nine cases (90%). 
In PBMC, positive strand of HCV RNA was detected in eight cases (80%), whereas
negative strand in only one case (10%), suggesting that HCV has much less
cellular tropism to PBMC than to hepatocytes.
