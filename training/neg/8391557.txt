Human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) is the causative agent for exanthem subitum. This
study investigated the relationship between idiopathic facial nerve palsy (Bell's
palsy), sudden deafness and HHV-6 infection. Both Bell's palsy and sudden
deafness are syndromes which causes are unknown. Both of them are suspected viral
infection as causative agents. Paired sera from 22 patients of Bell's palsy and
39 patients of sudden deafness were examined for reactivity to HHV-6 by the
indirect immunofluorescence test. On a case of Bell's palsy and two cases of
sudden deafness each of the HHV-6 antibody titers was increased.
