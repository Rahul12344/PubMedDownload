The incidence of C. dubliniensis in South America has not yet been determined. In
the present study, oral swab samples were taken from 108 HIV-infected/AIDS
individuals attending 6 separate Brazilian HIV-treatment centers to determine the
incidence of C. dubliniensis in this population. Swabs were plated onto CHROMagar
Candida medium and 155 isolates, presumptively identified as C. albicans or C.
dubliniensis were further investigated. In a preliminary screen for C.
dubliniensis, 13 of the 155 isolates showed no or poor growth at 42 degrees C,
and all them were subjected to randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis using C. dubliniensis-specific primers. 
We confirmed that 4 out of 13 isolates were C. dubliniensis, representing an
incidence rate of 2.8% for the Brazilian HIV-infected population infected with
yeasts exhibiting green colonies on CHROMagar Candida. This value is
significantly lower than those reported in Ireland and the United States.
