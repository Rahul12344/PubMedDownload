Following cell entry, viruses can be detected by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. These
cytotoxic T lymphocytes can induce host cell apoptosis and prevent the
propagation of the virus. Viruses with fewer epitopes have a higher survival
probability, and are selected through evolution. However, mutations have a
fitness cost and on evolutionary periods viruses maintain some epitopes. The
number of epitopes in each viral protein is a balance between the selective
advantage of having fewer epitopes and the reduced fitness following the epitope 
removing mutations. We discuss a bioinformatic analysis of the number of epitopes
in various viral proteins and propose an optimization framework to explain these 
numbers. We show, using a genomic analysis and a theoretical optimization
framework, that a critical factor affecting the number of presented epitopes is
the expression stage in the viral life cycle of the gene coding for the protein. 
The early expression of epitopes can lead to the destruction of the host cell
before budding can take place. We show that a lower number of epitopes is
expected in early proteins even if late proteins have a much higher copy number.
