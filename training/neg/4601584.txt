In vitro repair of apurinic sites in DNA.

Verly WG, Gossard F, Crine P.

Apurinic sites disappear from DNA during an incubation of the DNA with the
Escherichia coli endonuclease specific for apurinic sites, DNA polymerase I (EC
2.7.7.7.), and T4 ligase (EC 6.5.1.1). Omission of any one of these three enzymes
and, in particular, omission of the endonuclease specific for apurinic sites
prevents this in vitro repair.
