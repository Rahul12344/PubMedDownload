Butenko ZA, Smirnova IA.

A description is given of the differences in the fractional content of normal
cell nuclear RNA and in Rauscher leukemia, which are manifested in the appearance
of an accessory fraction 35 S RNA in leukemia-changed cells. The results of
examining poly(A)-RNA amounts in normal splenic cells cytoplasm and nuclei, and
in Rauscher leukemia are reported. The differences in the fractional content of
poly(A)-RNA of normal leukemia changed cells are described.
