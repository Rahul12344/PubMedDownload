Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome affects over 10 million persons worldwide. The
disease represents an enormous cost to society in health care resources and in
loss from the workforce. Although initially reported in 1980 as a disease
affecting mainly homosexuals and intravenous drug abusers with a predominance in 
males, the male to female ratio was close to parity by 1992. The disease attacks 
all systems in the body. Preanaesthetic evaluation focuses on assessment of lung 
function and presence of infection, evaluation of endocarditis and treatment of
congestive failure, rehydration and correction of electrolyte imbalances,
transfusion and documentation of central nervous system manifestations. The
Center for Disease Control and Prevention has produced guidelines to protect
health care workers from transmission of the virus. Although the risk of
infection is extremely low, these precautions should be routinely adopted.
