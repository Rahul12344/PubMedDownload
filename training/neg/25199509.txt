Porcine astroviruses (PAstVs) are common and genetically diverse viruses of
domestic pigs. In the present study, the prevalence of PAstV in healthy domestic 
pigs in Croatia was 89%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed genetic heterogeneity
among PAstV sequences; five lineages were detected, with PAstV-2 being
predominant, while PAstV-3 was detected for the first time outside North America.
