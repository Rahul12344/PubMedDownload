Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) is an enveloped RNA-containing virus of Family
Paramyxoviridae. Sequences had been determined previously for a number of PVM
genes, although these represented cloned cDNAs rather than consensus sequences.
Sequences were not available for the 3' -leader and 5' -trailer regions that
constitute the genome termini or for the large polymerase L gene that accounts
for 43% of the genome. Also, the available sequences were from an attenuated
variant of strain 15, whereas the present study analyzed the version of strain 15
that is available from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and is highly 
virulent in mice. Analysis of unclosed RT-PCR products yielded a complete
consensus sequence of 14,886 nt (GenBank accession number AY729016). Of the
regions for which sequences had been previously reported for the non-pathogenic
strain, there were 13 nucleotide differences and 10 amino acid differences
compared to the present consensus sequence for the virulent isolate. The various 
genes of PVM shared 29-62% nucleotide sequence identity and 10-60% amino acid
sequence identity with human or bovine respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV and
BRSV), its closest relatives.
