Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) has a high proclivity to replicate in
the larynx and trachea of chickens causing severe lesions. There is a lack of
knowledge on the ability of ILTV to replicate in other respiratory associated
tissues apart from in the trachea. The objective of this study was to investigate
how tissues that first encounter the virus dictate further sites of viral
replication during the lytic stage of infection. Replication patterns of the
pathogenic strain 63140 and the chicken embryo origin (CEO) vaccine in the
conjunctiva, the Harderian gland, nasal cavity and trachea were evaluated after
ocular, oral, intranasal or intratracheal inoculation of specific pathogen-free
chickens. Viral replication was assessed by detection of microscopic cytolytic
lesions, detection of viral antigen and viral genome load. The route of viral
entry greatly influenced virus replication of both strain 63140 and CEO vaccine
in the conjunctiva and trachea, while replication in the nasal cavity was not
affected. In the Harderian gland, independently of the route of viral entry,
microscopic lesions characteristic of lytic replication were absent, whereas
viral antigen and viral genomes for either virus were detected, suggesting that
the Harderian gland may be a key site of antigen uptake. Findings from this study
suggest that interactions of the virus with the epithelial-lymphoid tissues of
the nasal cavity, conjunctiva and the Harderian gland dictate patterns of ILTV
lytic replication.
