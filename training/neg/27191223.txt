During a dengue epidemic in northern Mexico, enhanced surveillance identified 53 
laboratory-positive cases in southern Texas; 26 (49%) patients acquired the
infection locally, and 29 (55%) were hospitalized. Of 83 patient specimens that
were initially IgM negative according to ELISA performed at a commercial
laboratory, 14 (17%) were dengue virus positive by real-time reverse
transcription PCR performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dengue virus types 1 and 3 were identified, and molecular phylogenetic analysis
demonstrated close identity with viruses that had recently circulated in Mexico
and Central America. Of 51 household members of 22 dengue case-patients who
participated in household investigations, 6 (12%) had been recently infected with
a dengue virus and reported no recent travel, suggesting intrahousehold
transmission. One household member reported having a recent illness consistent
with dengue. This outbreak reinforces emergence of dengue in southern Texas,
particularly when incidence is high in northern Mexico.
