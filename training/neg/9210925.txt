Seventeen monoclonal antibodies raised against bovine viral diarrhoea virus were 
divided into three groups on the basis of radioimmunoprecipitation results. Seven
monoclonal antibodies precipitated a polypeptide of 80kD and defined four
domains, all of which showed considerable conservation amongst the 180 pestivirus
strains and isolates examined. Nine monoclonal antibodies, including six with
virus neutralizing activity, precipitated a 53kD polypeptide and all appeared to 
be directed towards a single domain of clustered epitopes. Several of these
epitopes were present in many ruminant virus strains and isolates, but not in hog
cholera viruses. A single monoclonal antibody precipitated a 48kD polypeptide,
defining an epitope that was also present on many ruminant viruses, but not hog
cholera viruses. Most pestiviruses from cattle and some from sheep shared a
number of epitopes located on three different proteins.
