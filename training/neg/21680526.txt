Recent studies have shown that the ubiquitin (Ub) proteasome pathway (UPP) is
closely related to immune defense. We have identified a ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme, E2, from the Chinese white shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FcUbc).
Injection of recombinant FcUbc protein (rFcUbc) reduced the mortality of shrimp
infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and inhibited replication of WSSV.
rFcUbc, but not a mutant FcUbc (mFcUbc), bound to WSSV RING domains (WRDs) from
four potential E3 ligase proteins of WSSV in vitro. Importantly, rFcUbc could
ubiquitinate the RING domains (named WRD2 and WRD3) of WSSV277 and WSSV304
proteins in vitro and the two proteins in WSSV-infected Drosophila melanogaster
Schneider 2 (S2) cells. Furthermore, overexpression of FcUbc increased
ubiquitination of WSSV277 and WSSV304 during WSSV infection. In summary, our
study demonstrates that FcUbc from Chinese white shrimp inhibited WSSV
replication and could ubiquitinate WSSV RING domain-containing proteins. This is 
the first report about antiviral function of Ubc E2 in shrimp.
