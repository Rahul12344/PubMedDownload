AIDS: The Chicago Museum of Science and Industry recently opened its
4,000-square-foot permanent exhibit on the science of AIDS. The exhibit is
designed to educate visitors about immunology and virology by presenting AIDS as 
an example of an immune system breakdown and showing advances made in research
and prevention of diseases caused by viruses. The exhibit also seeks to engage
preteens with compelling graphics and interactive displays in the hope of
motivating them to pursue careers in science. One exhibit, called Frontline,
allows visitors to question several physicians and researchers specializing in
HIV/AIDS through a touch-screen video program. The exhibit allows these
professionals to reveal their commitment and explain their views on the future of
the pandemic.
