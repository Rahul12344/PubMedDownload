Methylation-dependent translation of viral messenger RNAs in vitro.

Both GW, Banerjee AK, Shatkin AJ.

Methylated reovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus mRNAs, synthesized in vitro in
the presence of S-adenosylmethionine by the virion-associated polymerases (RNA
nucleotidyltransferases, EC 2.7.7.6), stimulate protein synthesis by wehat germ
extracts to a greater extent than unmethylated mRNAs. Addition of
S-adenosylmethionine to a cell-free extract programmed with unmethylated mRNA
stimulates protein synthesis and results in methylation of the mRNA. An inhibitor
of mRNA methylation. S-adenosylhomocysteine, blocks translation of unmethylated, 
but not of methylated, mRNAs. Aurintricarboxylic acid, which inhibits
polypepetide chain initiation, also prevents mRNA methylation by wheat germ
extracts. In contrast, sparsomycin, which inhibits polypeptide chain elongation, 
does not reduce mRNA methylation. The results indicate that methylation of viral 
mRNA is required for translation in vitro and suggest that mRNA methylation
occurs at the initiation step of protein synthesis.
