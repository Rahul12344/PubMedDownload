Glycoproteins gB of Marek's disease virus (MDV) and herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) 
related to virus neutralization were purified from HVT-infected cells by affinity
chromatography. Immunization of chickens with purified glycoproteins gB resulted 
in partial protection against MD. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in
chickens immunized with HVT-gB.
