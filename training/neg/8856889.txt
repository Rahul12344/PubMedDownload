Ten outbreaks of calf respiratory disease in Danish dairy herds were investigated
by lung lavage, and in eight of the herds paired blood samples were tested
serologically. In six of the 10 herds bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV)
antigen was detected in the lung lavage fluids. In only one calf was coronavirus 
and BRSV detected simultaneously. The paired blood samples confirmed that four of
the herds were BRSV-infected, and in one herd the BRSV infection was diagnosed by
the paired blood samples alone. Significant increases in antibody titres against 
coronavirus were observed in two herds, both in combination with other
virological agents. No adenovirus antigen was detected in any of the lavage
samples, but in two herds a significant increase in antibody titres against
adenovirus was observed. Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) virus was not detected in the
lung lavage fluids, and in four of the herds, no antibodies to PI-3 were
detected. In three herds no viral involvement could be found. The findings
suggest that BRSV may be an important causative agent in calf respiratory disease
in Denmark, even in very young calves.
