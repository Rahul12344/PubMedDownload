Heterogeneity of B cell involvement in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.

In order to study the pattern of B cell involvement in acute nonlymphocytic
leukemia (ANLL), multiple B lymphoid cell lines were established by Epstein-Barr 
virus transformation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two patients with
the disease who were heterozygous for the X chromosome-linked glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD). In one patient, the progenitor cells involved by the
leukemia exhibited multipotent differentiative expression, whereas in the other
patient the cells showed differentiative expression restricted to the
granulocytic pathway. In the patient whose abnormal clone showed multipotent
expression, the ratio of B-A G6PD in B lymphoid cell lines was skewed in the
direction of type B (the enzyme characteristic of the leukemia clone) and
significantly different from the 1:1 ratio expected. It is, therefore, likely
that the neoplastic event occurred in a stem cell common to the lymphoid series
as well as to the myeloid series. In contrast, evidence for B cell involvement
was not detected in the patient whose ANLL progenitor cells exhibited restricted 
differentiative expression. These findings underscore the heterogeneity of ANLL. 
Clinically and morphologically similar malignancies in these two patients
originated in progenitors with different patterns of stem cell differentiative
expression. This difference may reflect differences in cause and pathogenesis.
