BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common symptom of liver disease but not well
characterized in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV).
AIMS: We assessed the rate of fatigue using a validated instrument in patients
with HBV and identified demographic, virologic, and clinical features associated 
with fatigue in a cross-sectional cohort study from the Hepatitis B Research
Network.
METHODS: Participants were English- and Spanish-speaking adults with chronic HBV 
who were not pregnant nor on treatment. Fatigue was measured using the PROMIS®
Fatigue 7-item Short Form.
RESULTS: The sample included 948 adults: median age 42; 51 % female; 71 % Asian; 
74 % college educated; 77 % employed; 41 % inactive HBV carriers; 36 % with
active chronic disease; and 2 % with advanced fibrosis, defined as AST-platelet
ratio index (APRI) > 1.50. Patients with chronic HBV had a mean fatigue T-score
of 46.8 ± SD = 7.9, compared to a mean fatigue T-score of 50.0 ± 10 in the US
general population (p < .0001). In univariate analyses, greater fatigue was
associated with demographic and clinical features such as female sex, lower
income, more comorbidities, higher APRI score, and poorer mental health (p <
0.05). In multivariate analysis, female sex (p < .001), poorer mental health (p <
.001), APRI score (p = .005), and history of diabetes (p = .039) were the
strongest independent predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of fatigue in this large cohort of North American
chronic HBV patients may be equal to or lower than that reported in the US
general population. Patients with advanced fibrosis, more comorbidities, and
poorer mental health report worse fatigue.
