Blockage of the induction of type I interferons (IFNs) is essential for the
success of influenza virus proliferation in host cells. Several molecular
mechanisms by which influenza viruses inhibit IFN induction have been
characterized. Here we report a potentially new strategy influenza viruses employ
to inhibit IFN production during viral infection. Through a two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis based proteomic approach, we found that the expression of IκB
kinase-gamma (IKKγ) was suppressed by influenza A virus infection in human lung
epithelial A549 cells. Silencing of cellular IKKγ by small interfering RNA led to
enhanced replication of influenza viruses. Concomitantly, overexpression of IKKγ 
resulted in increased production of IFNα/β, whereas influenza virus infection
completely eliminated the IKKγ-overexpression-induced production of IFNα/β. Our
results suggest that IKKγ and influenza virus are mutually inhibitory, and
influenza viruses may inhibit IFN production through suppressing the expression
of IKKγ during viral infection.
