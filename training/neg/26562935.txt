Invasive ants carry novel viruses in their new range and form reservoirs for a
honeybee pathogen.

When exotic animal species invade new environments they also bring an often
unknown microbial diversity, including pathogens. We describe a novel and widely 
distributed virus in one of the most globally widespread, abundant and damaging
invasive ants (Argentine ants, Linepithema humile). The Linepithema humile virus 
1 is a dicistrovirus, a viral family including species known to cause widespread 
arthropod disease. It was detected in samples from Argentina, Australia and New
Zealand. Argentine ants in New Zealand were also infected with a strain of
Deformed wing virus common to local hymenopteran species, which is a major
pathogen widely associated with honeybee mortality. Evidence for active
replication of viral RNA was apparent for both viruses. Our results suggest
co-introduction and exchange of pathogens within local hymenopteran communities. 
These viral species may contribute to the collapse of Argentine ant populations
and offer new options for the control of a globally widespread invader.
