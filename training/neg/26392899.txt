INTRODUCTION: EEHV-1 is a viral infection of elephants that has been associated
with a fatal haemorrhagic syndrome in Asian elephants. Previous studies have
suggested that pregnant animals may shed more virus than non-pregnant animals.
METHODS: This study examined whether pregnancy affected the frequency or
magnitude of shedding of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus 1 (EEHV1) using
Taq man real-time PCR on trunk washes from four female elephants from a UK
collection over three time periods between 2011 and 2014. These periods included 
pregnancies in two animals (period 1 and period 3). Behavioural observations made
by keepers were also assessed.
RESULTS: During period 1 there was a high degree of social hierarchical
instability which led to a hierarchy change, and was associated with aggressive
behaviour. Also during period 1 EEHV-1 shedding was of a higher magnitude and
frequency than in the latter two time periods.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is no clear relationship between
shedding and pregnancy, and that behavioural stressors may be related to an
increase in EEHV-1 shedding.
