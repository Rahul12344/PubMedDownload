Diverse serologic response to rotavirus infection of infants in a single
epidemic.

Clark HF, Dolan KT, Horton-Slight P, Palmer J, Plotkin SA.

Eight infants with onset of gastroenteritis occurring within a 32-day period were
examined for stool rotavirus antigen and serum antibody response to rotavirus.
Each infant presented evidence of rotavirus infection but no single test for
rotavirus-specific antigen or antibody was positive for every infected
individual. Rotavirus was identified in the stools of five infants; in the others
rotavirus etiology was determined by a specific immune response only. The
neutralizing antibody response to each of four human rotavirus serotypes and to
bovine rotavirus Nebraska calf diarrhea virus ranged from totally negative to a
specific response to up to four serotypes. Three originally seropositive infants 
each showed an increase in neutralizing antibody titer to two or more serotypes. 
However, two of five originally seronegative infants also developed antibody to
two or more serotypes. No consistent pattern of responses to different serotypes 
was detected.
