Noroviruses (NoVs) are considered as the leading cause of diarrheal diseases in
all groups of age. In the last decade the number of NoV outbreaks worldwide is
increasing. Data published by the systems of NoV surveillance show the GII.4
strain as the human predominant genotype circulating worldwide and new genetic
variants of GII.4 were associated with epidemic events. In Albania the economy
transformation has damaged significantly the environment and a large circulation 
of enteric viruses was reported in the past with the presence of NoV among the
genotyped strains. This study aimed to characterize, by molecular analysis, the
NoV GII strains detected in Albania during two time periods: in 2010 from the
outbreak occurred in Ballsh and in 2002-2003 from sporadic cases of diarrhoea. A 
total of 21 Nov GII strains were characterized. The NoV GII.4 was genotyped more 
frequently and it was related closely to the pandemic variants recorded in
GenBank. During 2002-2003, six NoV GII recombinant strains have been
characterized.
