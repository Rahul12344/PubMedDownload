We have combined epitope tagging with an expression cDNA library in order to
isolate cDNAs encoding nuclear proteins. This system allows us to detect proteins
expressed from the cDNA library by using antibodies against the epitope tag. As a
tag, we used the 85-aa N-terminal peptide of the SV40 T antigen which lacks the
nuclear localization signal (NLS). A strong expression vector, pEF204 [Kim et
al., Gene 91 (1990) 217-223], was modified into an epitope-tagging vector, pTkim,
by putting the tag-coding region and a cDNA cloning site immediately after its
promoter. From cDNA libraries constructed using pTkim, we isolated eight cDNA
clones whose tagged proteins were localized within the nuclei. From partial
sequence analysis, two cDNAs were shown to code for the ribosomal (r-) proteins, 
simian L44 and human L21, and the others were shown to be new. Furthermore, six
cDNAs including those encoding the r-proteins could direct a non-karyophilic T
antigen [Fischer-Fantuzzi et al., Virology 153 (1986) 87-95] into nuclei, showing
that they have NLSs. These results indicate that this system is useful for
isolating new cDNAs which code for nuclear proteins.
