A gene was identified within the DNA sequences of the EcoRI DNA fragment N (4.3
kbp) of the genome of equine herpesvirus type 2 (EHV-2) coding for a protein (179
amino acid residues) homologous to the cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor
(CSIF; interleukin 10) of the human and mouse, and to the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) protein BCRF1. This finding is further significant evidence that the
interleukin 10 (IL-10) and/or IL-10-like gene can indeed be present in the
genomes of members of the herpesviral family.
