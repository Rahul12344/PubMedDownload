Sexual transmission of HIV requires that the virus crosses mucosal barriers and
disseminates into lymphoid tissue, the major site of viral replication. To
achieve this, HIV might engage DC-SIGN, a calcium dependent lectin that is
expressed on mucosal dendritic cells (DCs), which binds avidly to HIV. DC-SIGN
and other attachment factors are likely to account for the well-known ability of 
DCs to enhance infection of T cells by HIV. Attachment of HIV to DC-SIGN might
thus enhance viral spread in mucosal tissues and, by taking advantage of the
inherent capacity of DCs to migrate into lymphoid tissue, might promote viral
dissemination within the host. DC-SIGN and a related molecule, termed DC-SIGNR,
also enhance infection by Ebola virus. The expression of these lectins on early
targets of Ebola virus infection, like liver endothelial cells and alveolar
macrophages, suggests an important role for DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR in the
establishment of Ebola infection. This article reviews the interaction of DC-SIGN
and DC-SIGNR with HIV and Ebola, discusses the mechanism of DC-SIGN-mediated
viral transmission and examines how this process could be inhibited by potential 
therapeutics.
