Kerala State in India was gripped by a renewed and widespread outbreak of
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection during 2007. Here, we report the A226V
mutation in the glycoprotein envelope 1 (E1) gene of the virus among isolates
collected from the three worst-affected districts of the state during this
outbreak. This mutation had already been suggested to be directly responsible for
a significant increase in CHIKV infectivity in Aedes albopictus. The badly
affected districts in Kerala State during 2007 have abundant rubber plantations, 
which supported prolific breeding of Ae. albopictus mosquitoes. The abundance of 
Ae. albopictus in the region and molecular evolution of CHIKV may be contributing
factors for the renewed epidemic of chikungunya fever during 2007.
