Liver fibrosis is used to make decisions about the timing of therapy against
hepatitis C virus (HCV) in routine clinical practice, which should be based on
the short-term likelihood of liver decompensations. Thus, we aimed at evaluating 
the risk of decompensations and death among human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)/HCV-coinfected individuals according to their baseline fibrosis classified 
by either liver biopsy or liver stiffness measurement (LSM). Patients coinfected 
with HIV/HCV, naive or without sustained virological response to HCV therapy,
were included in this cohort. Fibrosis was classified by biopsy in 683 patients
and by LSM in 1046 individuals. Reference categories were fibrosis stage 0 and
LSM <6 kPa. For patients with biopsy, the adjusted subhazard ratio for
decompensations and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) by fibrosis stage were as
follows: stage 1, 2.3 (0.27-20.3), P = 0.443; stage 2, 2.8 (0.33-24), P = 0.345; 
stage 3, 4.91 (0.60-41), P = 0.137; stage 4, 9.89 (1.25-79.5), P = 0.030. For
patients with LSM, the adjusted subhazard ratio and 95% CI by LSM category were
as follows: 6-9.4 kPa, 1.89 (0.18-20.3), P = 0.599; 9.5-14.5 kPa, 6.59
(0.73-59.2), P = 0.092; ≥14.6 kPa, 59.5 (8.3-427), P < 0.0001. Regarding the risk
of death, the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI for death by fibrosis stage were
as follows: stage 1, 1.3 (0.4-4.11), P = 0.677; stage 2, 2.68 (0.86-8.36),
P = 0.090; stage 3, 2.58 (0.82-8.15), P = 0.106; stage 4, 4.35 (1.43-13.3),
P = 0.010. For patients with LSM, the adjusted hazard ratio and 95% CI for death 
by LSM were as follows: 6-9.4 kPa, 1.7 (0.63-4.79), P = 0.288; 9.5-14.5 kPa, 3.38
(1.2-9.5), P = 0.021; ≥14.6 kPa, 12.7 (4.9-33.6), P < 0.0001.CONCLUSION: Patients
coinfected with HIV/HCV without advanced fibrosis are at very low risk of
decompensations in the short term; deferral of HCV therapy for a few years and
monitoring fibrosis progression is a safe option until cheaper, more effective,
and more convenient HCV treatment becomes widely available.
