Identifying the role of axonal injury in the development of permanent,
irreversible neurologic disability is important to the study of central nervous
system (CNS) demyelinating diseases. Our understanding of neurologic dysfunction 
in demyelinating diseases and the ability to assess therapeutic interventions
depends on the development of objective functional assays that can non-invasively
measure axonal loss. In this study, we demonstrate in a murine model of
progressive CNS demyelination that assessment of the hindlimb width of stride
provides a powerful indicator of axonal loss and can dissociate between deficits 
induced by demyelination versus axonal loss.
