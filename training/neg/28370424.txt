Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF) are blistering autoimmune
diseases that depend on interaction between genetic and environmental factors.
Viral infections, like herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV1/2), cytomegalovirus
(CMV), Epstein-Barr virus and dengue virus, could trigger or exacerbate
pemphigus. IgM and IgG antibodies against these viruses in serum from PV and PF, 
their relatives and controls were determined. HSV1/2 expression was evaluated by 
direct immunofluorescence (DIF) and qPCR in affected or not oral mucosa from PV
patients compared with uninjured PF mucosa. IgG anti-HSV1 was higher in the PV
group compared with all groups. IgG anti-CMV resulted higher in PV group compared
with PF patients and PV relatives. HSV1 was confirmed by DIF and qPCR on oral
samples from patients with PV. Lack of HSV1 expression in the oral mucosa of
patients with PF corroborate that immunosuppressive therapy cannot be the main
cause for HSV1 replication in PV disease.
