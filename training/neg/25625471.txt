Glycoprotein G (gG) from herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2, important
human neurotropic pathogens) is the first viral chemokine-binding protein found
to potentiate chemokine function. Here we show that gG attaches to cell surface
glycosaminoglycans and induces lipid raft clustering, increasing the
incorporation of CXCR4 receptors into these microdomains. gG induces
conformational rearrangements in CXCR4 homodimers and changes their intracellular
partners, leading to sustained, functional chemokine/receptor complexes at the
surface. This results in increased chemotaxis dependent on the cholesterol
content of the plasma membrane and receptor association to Src-kinases and
phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase signalling pathways, but independent of
clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, using electron microscopy, we show
that such enhanced functionality is associated with the accumulation of low-order
CXCR4 nanoclusters. Our results provide insights into basic mechanisms of
chemokine receptor function and into a viral strategy of immune modulation.
