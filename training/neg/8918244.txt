We have investigated the requirements necessary for high-level production of the 
hepatitis B virus (HBV strain ayw) large surface glycoprotein preS1 with vaccinia
virus (VV) recombinants. In earlier studies, only nanogram amounts of preS1 could
be obtained from cells infected with an appropriate recombinant VV carrying the
preS1 gene under the transcriptional control of a conventional VV promoter
(p7.5). Here, we report that the use of an improved promoter system, i.e., the
bacteriophage T7 polymerase/VV hybrid expression system (T7/EMC system) in
combination with a G-C conversion at position 5 of the preS1 open reading frame, 
deleting the myristylation motif of the polypeptide, results in an at least
12-fold increase in preS1 expression compared to the wild-type preS1 expressed
with the strongest homologous VV promoter system known so far. Although the
T7/EMC promoter system was most effective, improved expression of the modified
preS1 (preS1dMyr) is independent from the promoter system used, from the
insertion locus of the modified preS1 within the VV genome and also from the cell
line used for expression studies.
