HIV-1 develops resistance to CCR5 antagonists such as Maraviroc (MVC) and
Vicriviroc (VVC) both in vitro and in vivo, with most changes arising in the
gp120 V3 region. Both compounds bind to the same hydrophobic cavity in CCR5 in
subtly different ways. Here, we investigated which V3 sequence changes are most
associated with MVC and VVC resistance and how they affect the interaction
between gp120 and the CCR5 NT. We found that VVC- and MVC-selected amino acid
changes map to different V3 locations and involve residues that interact with the
CCR5 NT in different ways. Changes in VVC-selected, but not MVC-selected,
variants often involve charged residues. Although the overall V3 charge tends not
to change, the introduction or removal of charged residues at specific positions 
affects the local electrostatic potential and could have structural and
functional implications. In summary, VVC and MVC trigger the evolution of
distinct HIV-1 resistance patterns in V3.
