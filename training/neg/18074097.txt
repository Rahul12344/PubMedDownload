HIV-1 infection of neonates results in an extended acute period of virus
replication, frequent neurological problems and reduced survival compared to
adults. In adults, R5 viruses mainly infect CCR5(+) CD4(+) memory T-cells. In
neonates, CCR5(+) memory T-cells form a substantially smaller fraction of total
lymphocytes. We therefore tested whether alternative coreceptors confer infection
of lymphocytes by pediatric isolates. Pediatric HIV-1 R5 isolates failed to
replicate in Delta32/Delta32 CCR5 PBMCs or in cord PBMCs treated with a CCR5
inhibitor. These results do not indicate a role for alternative coreceptors and
provide support for CCR5 inhibitors in the therapy of HIV-1(+) neonates.
