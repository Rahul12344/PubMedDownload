Experience of vaccination with inactivated poliomyelitis vaccines in Iceland.

Gudnad√≥ttir M.

Iceland, as a few other European countries, has used inactivated vaccine against 
poliomyelitis from the beginning in 1956. No cases of paralytic polio occurred
since 1960. For 17 years neither isolations of poliovirus nor suspected cases of 
the clinical disease have been recorded. Studies on neutralizing antibodies in
sera of vaccinees were not too encouraging after 4 injections. A 5th vaccination 
of IPV was therefore given to those children who lacked antibodies to any type of
poliovirus. One month after the 5th injection 70% had antibodies against all 3
types of poliovirus and only 2% lacked antibodies against both types 1 and 3. In 
countries where no virus to boost immunity exists any longer during the life of
an individual it may be necessary to secure booster effects at regular intervals 
after primary vaccination and later in life. This will be included in the
vaccination schedule against polio in Iceland.
