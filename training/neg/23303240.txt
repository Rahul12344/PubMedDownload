We examined HIV-1 resistance in children failing first-line and second-line
antiretroviral therapy in South Africa, all with clade C virus. Those exposed to 
full-dose ritonavir had multiple protease resistance mutations. Nineteen percent 
had wild-type virus. Appropriate antiretroviral therapy sequencing in sub-Saharan
African children is essential for prolong treatment options.
