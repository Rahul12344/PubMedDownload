BACKGROUND: Control of transgene expression in mammalian cells is desirable for
gene therapy and the study of gene function in basic research. This study
evaluates the functionality of single adenovirus (Ad) vectors containing a
tetracycline-controllable expression system (tet-off or tet-on system).
METHODS: An Ad-mediated binary transgene expression system was generated
containing a tet-off or a tet-on system, which introduced the gene of interest
with a tetracycline-regulatable promoter and the tetracycline-responsive
transcriptional activator gene into the E1 and E3 deletion regions, respectively.
The functionality of the Ad-mediated tet-off and tet-on systems was compared
under various conditions in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: The Ad vector containing the tet-off system provided negative control of
gene expression ranging from 20- to 500-fold, depending on the cell type and
condition. In contrast, the Ad vector containing the tet-on system increased gene
expression by only 2- to 28-fold and required about two-log orders higher
concentration of an inducer (doxycycline) to switch on the gene expression,
compared with the Ad vector containing the tet-off system.
CONCLUSION: Ad vectors containing the tet-off system are a better choice for
regulated gene expression than Ad vectors containing the tet-on system. Single Ad
vectors containing the tetracycline-controllable expression system will greatly
facilitate in vitro and in vivo analyses of gene function and may be useful for
gene therapy.
