Lipid rafts are sphingolipid- and cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains,
which are involved in entry, assembly and budding of various types of viruses.
Identification of rafts associated proteins modified by virus infection could
therefore provide novel insights into the mechanisms of virus infection as well
as the development of new biomarkers for diagnosis and drug development.
Proteomic approaches, such as LC-ESI-MS/MS, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (2D-PAGE), two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis
(2D-DIGE), isotope-coded affinity tags (ICAT), Proteolytic ¹⁸O Labeling, isotope 
Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ), Stable Isotope Labeling
with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC) and Multidimensional Protein
Identification Technology (MudPIT), provide the large scale and unbiased platform
to determine the dynamic profiles of the lipid rafts proteome. In this review, we
summarized the research advance regarding modern proteomics analysis of host
lipid rafts alterations in response to diverse virus infection.
