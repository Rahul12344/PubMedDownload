Human interferons and their purification.

Zielińska-Jenczylik J, Cembrzyńska-Nowak M, Sypuła A.

The present paper describes briefly the procedure used in our laboratory for the 
preparation of HuIFN-alpha. Induction of interferon was carried out in the
suspension of human leukocytes from peripheral blood, using Newcastle virus as
inducer. The optimal conditions to produce interferon were established in the
media with and without serum. Moreover, the work reports the results of studies
on the purification of HuIFN-alpha and HuIFN-beta interferons.
