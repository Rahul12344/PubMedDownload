Leukaemia virus infection promotes fibroblast transformation by normal BALB/c
mouse DNA.

Krump-Konvalinkova V, van den Berg KJ.

All normal cells are thought to carry genetic information for oncogenic
transformation, which, on activation to continuous expression, might make the
cell cancerous. The presently known transforming retroviruses contain
transforming genes which were probably derived by recombination of a slow
oncogenic retrovirus with cellular sequences closely related to these genes. It
was recently reported that cellular DNA fragments from normal tissue culture
cells could transform mouse fibroblasts in vitro with a low efficiency. High
efficiency of transformation was observed in secondary transfections only when
high molecular weight DNA from transformed recipient cells was used as the
transforming agent. We observed that DNA isolated from different BALB/c mouse
organs can transform both NIH/3T3 and BALB/3T3 cells, although at a low
frequency. In attempts to increase the initial efficiency of transformation, we
have found that preinfection of recipient 3T3 cells with murine leukaemia viruses
markedly enhances focus formation by normal BALB/c DNA fragments.
