Skeletal mineralization is an important step regulating the mechanical properties
of the calcified tissues, but molecular events underlying mineralization still
remain elusive. We examined the role of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(Erk) pathways in matrix mineralization of osteogenic cells both in vitro and in 
vivo. Matrix mineralization by preosteocytic MLO-A5 cells and osteoblastic
MC3T3-E1 cells was increased by either PD98059 Mek inhibitor treatment or
adenovirus vector-mediated dominant negative Ras (Ras(DN)) expression and was
suppressed by Erk activation by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) treatment
or constitutively active Mek1 (Mek(CA)) expression. Administration of adenovirus 
vectors carrying Ras(DN) gene onto the calvaria of 1-day-old mice increased the
mineralization of the tissues, while that of the Mek(CA) adenovirus suppressed
it. These results suggest that the Erk pathway is a negative regulator of the
matrix mineralization both in vitro and in vivo.
