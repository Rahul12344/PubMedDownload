BACKGROUND: On March 23, 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified
of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea. On August 8, the WHO
declared the epidemic to be a "public health emergency of international concern."
METHODS: By September 14, 2014, a total of 4507 probable and confirmed cases,
including 2296 deaths from EVD (Zaire species) had been reported from five
countries in West Africa--Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We
analyzed a detailed subset of data on 3343 confirmed and 667 probable Ebola cases
collected in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone as of September 14.
RESULTS: The majority of patients are 15 to 44 years of age (49.9% male), and we 
estimate that the case fatality rate is 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69
to 73) among persons with known clinical outcome of infection. The course of
infection, including signs and symptoms, incubation period (11.4 days), and
serial interval (15.3 days), is similar to that reported in previous outbreaks of
EVD. On the basis of the initial periods of exponential growth, the estimated
basic reproduction numbers (R0 ) are 1.71 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.01) for Guinea, 1.83
(95% CI, 1.72 to 1.94) for Liberia, and 2.02 (95% CI, 1.79 to 2.26) for Sierra
Leone. The estimated current reproduction numbers (R) are 1.81 (95% CI, 1.60 to
2.03) for Guinea, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.41 to 1.60) for Liberia, and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.27
to 1.51) for Sierra Leone; the corresponding doubling times are 15.7 days (95%
CI, 12.9 to 20.3) for Guinea, 23.6 days (95% CI, 20.2 to 28.2) for Liberia, and
30.2 days (95% CI, 23.6 to 42.3) for Sierra Leone. Assuming no change in the
control measures for this epidemic, by November 2, 2014, the cumulative reported 
numbers of confirmed and probable cases are predicted to be 5740 in Guinea, 9890 
in Liberia, and 5000 in Sierra Leone, exceeding 20,000 in total.
CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that without drastic improvements in control
measures, the numbers of cases of and deaths from EVD are expected to continue
increasing from hundreds to thousands per week in the coming months.
