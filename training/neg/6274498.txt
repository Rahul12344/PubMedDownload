Modification of the poliovirus capsid by ultraviolet light.

De Sena J, Jarvis DL.

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of type I poliovirus resulted in a modified (M)
particle that had lost infectivity, lacked ability to adsorb to HeLa cells,
lacked VP4, and reduced in S value. Additional irradiation resulted in the loss
of VP2, further reduction in S value, and permeability of the capsid to RNAse,
This particle (C) as well as M contain the genome. Acid pH (5.5-65) and
sulfhydryl-reducing substances (dithiothreitol. reduced glutathione, and
L-cysteine) inhibited UV-induced modification of the capsid. UV irradiation at
alkaline pH (7.5-8.5) resulted in more extensive modification of the capsid than 
irradiation at neutral pH. Ionic compounds were found to inhibit the modifying
reaction.
