Transmission electron microscopy (of ultrathin sections) was used to examine the 
biomass of lung tissue in the immunodeficiency minipigs experimentally infected
with Pneumocystis carinii. The material was found to contain pneumocysts,
bacteria, and coronaviruses. There was a clear coronavirus-pneumocyst structural 
relationship. The findings suggest the combined effect of microorganisms of
different systematic groups on the development of a pathological process in the
experimental infection etiologically determined by Pneumocystis carinii.
