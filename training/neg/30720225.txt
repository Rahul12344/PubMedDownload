The overall promise of breast cancer chemoprevention is exemplified by clinical
success of selective estrogen receptor modulators and aromatase inhibitors.
Despite clinical efficacy, these interventions have limitations, including rare
but serious side effects and lack of activity against estrogen receptor-negative 
breast cancers. We have shown previously that dietary administration of benzyl
isothiocyanate (BITC), which occurs naturally as a thioglucoside conjugate in
edible cruciferous vegetables, inhibits development of estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancer in mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) transgenic mice. This
study demonstrates AKT-mediated sugar addiction in breast cancer chemoprevention 
by BITC. BITC-treated MMTV-neu mice exhibited increased 2-deoxy-2-(18
F)-fluoro-D-glucose (18 F-FDG) uptake in mammary tumors in vivo in comparison
with mice fed basal diet. Cellular studies using MDA-MB-231 and SUM159 human
breast cancer cell lines revealed BITC-mediated induction and punctate
localization of glucose transporter GLUT-1, which was accompanied by an increase 
in intracellular pyruvate levels. BITC treatment resulted in increased S473
phosphorylation (activation) of AKT in cells in vitro as well as in mammary
tumors of MMTV-neu mice in vivo. Increased glucose uptake, punctate pattern of
GLUT-1 localization, and intracellular pyruvate levels resulting from BITC
exposure were significantly attenuated in the presence of a pharmacological
inhibitor of AKT (MK-2206). Inhibition of AKT augmented BITC-mediated inhibition 
of cell migration and colony formation. BITC-induced apoptotic cell death was
also increased by pharmacological inhibition of AKT. These results indicate
increased glucose uptake/metabolism by BITC treatment in breast cancer cells
suggesting that breast cancer chemoprevention by BITC may be augmented by
pharmacological inhibition of AKT.
