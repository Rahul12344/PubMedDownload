Epstein-Barr virus-related herpesvirus from a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) with
malignant lymphoma.

A herpesvirus (RhEBV) was isolated from a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) that
became established from a malignant lymphoma in a rhesus monkey. The predominant 
cell marker in the LCL was that of B lymphocytes. RhEBV-induced viral capsid
(VCA) and nuclear antigens (NA) in the LCL were serologically related to similar 
antigens known to be induced by human Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). RhEBV was of
nonhuman primate origin and was clearly differentiated from EBV in the
anti-complement immunofluorescence reaction using human and non-human primate
sera with antibodies to the NA induced by the respective viruses. While human
sera reacted with NA induced by both EBV and RhEBV, monkey sera failed to
recognize the NA induced by EBV. RhEBV-induced NA was present in nearly all the
cells of a suspension prepared from the tumor tissue mass, but not in the
monolayer fibroblasts derived from the tumor tissue or in the blood and
lymph-node lymphocytes of clinically healthy animals. RhEBV induced in vitro
transformation and establishment of LCLs from peripheral blood lymphocytes of
normal rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys but not from those of 6 other non-human
primate species tested. The LCLs, with predominant B-lymphocyte markers,
established after treatment with RhEBV, all had evidence of the virus infection
since nearly all cells in the culture expressed the virus-induced NA.
