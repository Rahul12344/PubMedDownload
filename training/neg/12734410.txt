HIV-1 has at its disposal numerous proteins encoded by its genome which provide
the required arsenal to establish and maintain infection in its host for a
considerable number of years. One of the most important and enigmatic of these
proteins is Nef. The Nef protein of HIV-1 plays a fundamental role in the virus
life cycle. This small protein of approximately 27 kDa is required for maximal
virus replication and disease progression. The mechanisms by which it is able to 
act as a positive factor during virus replication is an area of intense research 
and although some controversy surrounds Nef much has been gauged as to how it
functions. Its ability to modulate the expression of key cellular receptors
important for cell activation and control signal transduction elements and events
by interacting with numerous cellular kinases and signalling molecules, including
members of the Src family kinases, leading to an effect on host cell function is 
likely to explain at least in part its role during infection and represents a
finely tuned mechanism where this protein assists HIV-1 to control its host.
