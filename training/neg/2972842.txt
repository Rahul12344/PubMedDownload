Using a short-term transfection assay, we show that the E4 early adenovirus
promoter is expressed to a certain extent in undifferentiated F9 and PCC4 cells, 
which are known to possess cellular E1A-like activity. We have also observed that
c-myc products trans-activate the E4 promoter in EC stem cells and HeLa cells.
Using 5' deletion mutants of the E4 promoter, we show that the same target
sequence is used by c-myc and E1A. This sequence is located between positions
-179 and -158 upstream of the cap site and is known to contain an activating
transcription factor (ATF)-binding site. Moreover, the basal of level of activity
of the deletion mutants. is related to the number of ATF binding sites. We
therefore suggest that c-myc is a functional cellular homolog of the viral E1A
gene and that it might correspond to one of the cellular E1A-like activities
previously described for EC stem cells. We have also observed that only a c-myc
plasmid coding for both p67 and 64 proteins, in contrast to one coding for p64
only, is able to trans-activate the E4 and E2A adenovirus promoter, suggesting
that the p67 protein plays an essential part in activation.
