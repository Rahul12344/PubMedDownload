Complexes of Rep protein with ATP and DNA as a basis for helicase action.

Arai N, Arai K, Kornberg A.

The rep protein of Escherichia coli, a helicase that unwinds duplex DNA at a
replication fork (Kornberg, A., Scott, J. F., and Bertsch, L. L. (1978) J. Biol. 
Chem. 253, 3298-3304), forms binary complexes with ATP and with DNA, and ternary 
complexes with both. ATP (or dATP) is bound at a single site with a dissociation 
constant (KD) near 10(-7) M. Other ribonucleoside triphosphates and
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates compete for the same site with far lower
affinities. The protein forms a binary complex with single-stranded DNA and with 
duplex DNA, each at distinctive sites. Binding to single-stranded DNA covers a
stretch of approximately 20 nucleotides, destabilizes secondary structure, and
facilitates reannealing of complementary single strands. Ternary complexes of rep
protein with ATP and DNA are manifested by ATP hydrolysis and by binding of
labeled components. Nonhydrolyzed ATP analogs are useful aids for isolation and
studies of such complexes. Unlike rep protein's processive action as a helicase
at a replication fork, its action on single-stranded DNA is distributive, with
ATP hydrolysis accelerating dissociation of the protein from the complex. These
and related studies serve as guides to understanding the multiple interactions of
rep protein with its ATP and DNA ligands that enable it to unwind duplex DNA at a
replication fork.
