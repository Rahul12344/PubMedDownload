Antiretroviral effect of thiolated nucleotide 4-thio-uridylate (S4UMP, designated
as UD29) against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been
quantitatively determined in cell-based viral infectivity assays. In syntitium
inhibition assay on MT-2 human T-cell line UD29 prevented cell fusion and
formation of syntitia induced by HIV-1IIIB with IC50 values of 11.7 μg/ml. In a
single-cycle viral infection assay (MAGI assay) UD29 proved to have a potent
inhibitory effect against HIV-1IIIB on HeLaCD4-LTR/β-gal cells, which was dose
dependent with IC50 values of 4.75 μg/ml and IC90 of 39.7 μg/ml. UD29 showed a
most prominent antiviral effect when administered 30 min prior HIV-1 infection.
As HIV entry requires thiol/disulfide exchange process, results suggest that
reactive -SH group of enol-form of the thiolated nucleotide may interfere with
the function of cell surface proteins. UD29 cannot penetrate into cells and may
have an interactive role in redox processes active in viral entry.
