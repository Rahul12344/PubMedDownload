Model systems of infecting limphoblastic MP-1 and BJAB cells by Epstein-Barr
virus, 5 serotype adenovirus and double infection are developed. A rather high
level of accumulation of DNA of these viruses in the cells in dynamics at
monoinfection and inhibition interference at multi-infection was shown by PCR
method. The influence of virus infection on proliferative activity was studied.
The stimulation of cells growth in the system BJAB + EBV was detected, and double
infecting inhibited the process by 50%. The 25% difference in development of
apoptosis process between cells infected by adenovirus and EBV was established
when defining CD95-mediated apoptosis in infected MP-1 cells. The infecting of
BJAB cells by viruses had a scarce effect on the processes of spontaneous
apoptosis, but the data on CD95-mediated apoptosis at EBV infection testify to
inhibition of this process both at a monoinfection, and at a double infection.
The work was performed in the framework of the fundamental agreement of Ministry 
of Education and Science of Ukraine F7/366-2001, and grant INTAS N011-2382.
