OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in herpetic stromal 
keratitis (HSK).
METHODS: Eighty BALB/c mice were divided into two groups and infected with HSV-1 
Mckrae strain by corneal scarification. Murine rIL-10 (20 ng/ml) was inoculated
intracorneally 6 h before and again on days 0, 2 and 4 after topical HSV-1
corneal infection. rIL-10 (500 ng) was given intraperitoneally in treated mice
simultaneously. The same amount of saline was injected into the control mice. The
effects of IL-10 on HSK were evaluated.
RESULTS: In the IL-10-treated animals, the onset of HSK was delayed, corneal
stromal opacification and neovascularization were reduced, extensive cellular
infiltrates in the cornea were prevented and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) 
was weakened. Examination of pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in the cornea 10
days after the infection revealed that the amounts of IL-2 and IL-6 were lower
than those found in the controls. IL-10 did not suppress the viral replication
nor did it eliminate the virus from IL-10-treated eyes, as compared with the
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: IL-10 treatment can suppress DTH responsiveness and the production
of certain cytokines by corneal cells. It delays the onset and decreases the
severity of HSK.
