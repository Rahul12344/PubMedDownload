n-Chimaerin is a recently described phorbol ester receptor that shares homology
in its N-terminal region with the cysteine-rich zinc finger domain of protein
kinase C. We have expressed n-chimaerin in insect cells using the baculovirus
system and have used the isolated, recombinant n-chimaerin to characterize
phorbol ester binding and structure-activity relations, lipid requirements, and
inhibitor sensitivity. We find that n-chimaerin expressed in the baculovirus
system bound [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate with high affinity (0.17 +/- 0.01 nM). 
Although having only a single cysteine-rich zinc finger region compared to two
for protein kinase C, n-chimaerin thus closely resembled protein kinase C alpha. 
n-Chimaerin was likewise virtually indistinguishable from protein kinase C alpha 
in phorbol ester structure-activity relations, in phospholipid requirements, and 
in inhibition of binding by sphingosine and calphostin C, protein kinase C
inhibitors acting on the regulatory domain. We conclude that a number of typical 
approaches used to implicate protein kinase C in biological function in cells do 
not discriminate between the n-chimaerin and protein kinase C classes of phorbol 
ester receptors.
