Laryngeal carcinomas are aggressive neoplasms with controversial association with
the human papillomavirus (HPV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). So far, the
impairment of p53 protein function and its impact on cellular proliferation has
not been studied adequately in these tumors. In this work, molecular biologic
techniques were used to assess the frequency of HPV and EBV in 110 squamous cell 
carcinomas of the larynx. In addition, accumulation of p53 and Ki-67 cell
proliferation antigen expression in malignant cells was assessed by
immunohistochemical analysis. High-grade HPV was found in 37.3% of cases, and
none had demonstrable EBV infection. Accumulation of p53 was found in 78.2% of
the cases, and it was related to a high Ki-67 labeling index and higher
histologic grade. The results demonstrate association of HPV with more than one
third of laryngeal carcinomas studied, mainly glottic tumors. Tumors with
increased cell proliferation were more frequently high grade, with p53
accumulation and lymph node metastasis.
