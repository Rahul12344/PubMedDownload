OBJECTIVES: The single radial immunodiffusion (SRID) assay, used to quantify
hemagglutinin (HA) in influenza vaccines, requires reference reagents; however,
because centralized production of reference reagents may slow the emergency
deployment of vaccines, alternatives are needed.
RESULTS: We investigated the production of HA proteins using recombinant DNA
technology, rather than a traditional egg-based production process. The HA
proteins were then used in an SRID assay as a reference antigen. We found that HA
can be quantified in both egg-based and cell-based influenza vaccines when
recombinant HAs (rHAs) are used as the reference antigen. Furthermore, we
confirmed that rHAs obtained from strains with pandemic potential, such as H5N1, 
H7N3, H7N9, and H9N2 strains, can be utilized in the SRID assay. The rHA
production process takes just one month, in contrast to the traditional process
that takes three to four months.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of rHAs may reduce the time required to produce reference
reagents and facilitate timely introduction of vaccines during emergencies.
