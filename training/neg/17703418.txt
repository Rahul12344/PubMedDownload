BACKGROUND: A spectrum of cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is detectable
in nonmelanoma skin cancers, as well as in healthy skin, but the significance
that the presence of these types of HPV DNA has for the pathogenesis of skin
cancer remains unclear.
METHODS: We studied 349 nonimmunosuppressed patients with skin lesions (82 with
squamous cell carcinomas, 126 with basal cell carcinomas, 49 with actinic
keratoses, and 92 with benign lesions). After superficial skin had been removed
by tape, paired biopsy samples--from the lesion and from healthy skin from the
same patient--were tested for HPV DNA. Risk factors for HPV DNA were analyzed in 
multivariate models.
RESULTS: Overall, 12% of healthy skin samples were positive for HPV DNA, compared
with 26% of benign lesions, 22% of actinic keratoses, 18% of basal cell
carcinomas, and 26% of squamous cell carcinomas. HPV DNA was associated with
sites extensively exposed to the sun, both for the lesions (odds ratio [OR], 4.45
[95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.44-8.11]) and for the healthy skin samples (OR, 
3.65 [95% CI 1.79-7.44]). HPV types of Beta-papillomavirus species 2 predominate 
in squamous cell carcinomas (OR, 4.40 [95% CI, 1.92-10.06]), whereas HPV types of
Beta-papillomavirus species 1 are primarily found in benign lesions (OR, 3.47
[95% CI, 1.72-6.99]).
CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous HPV types are primarily detected at sites extensively
exposed to the sun. HPV types of Beta-papillomavirus species 2, but not of
species 1, are associated with squamous cell carcinoma.
