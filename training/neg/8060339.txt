Recent studies demonstrated, that the R/U5 region of the Bovine Leukemia Virus
(BLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) up-regulates the virus promoter. It is also
known that this effect is independent from the BLV trans activator protein,
p34tax, encoded by the virus genome. Deletions were constructed in the R/U5
region to localize the sequences responsible for this effect. The activity of the
different constructs was determined in a transient expression system. Our results
show that a 64 bp long sequence (called DAS), present at the 3 end of the R
region, is involved in the activation. The in vivo results indicate that DAS
could be divided into two independent but overlapping elements (DAS1,2). Sequence
comparison allows the identification of three conservative boxes in these
elements. Our results suggest, that these boxes are functional only together. The
gel-shift assay with DAS2, in good agreement with the in vivo data, demonstrates 
that only the full length element forms a low mobility DNA-protein complex.
