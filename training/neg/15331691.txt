The specificity determinants for susceptibility to resistance by the Fv1 n and b 
alleles map to amino acid 110 of the murine leukemia virus CA protein. To study
the interaction between Fv1 and CA, we examined changes in CA resulting in the
loss of susceptibility to Fv1 resistance in naturally occurring NB- and NR-tropic
viruses. A variety of amino acid changes affecting Fv1 tropism were identified,
at CA positions 82, 92 to 95, 105, 114, and 117, and they all were mapped to the 
apparent exterior of virion-associated CA. These amino acids may form a binding
surface for Fv1.
