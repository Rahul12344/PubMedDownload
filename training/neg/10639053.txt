Central to infection by a majority of DNA viruses is the expression of encoded
proteins that modify cell cycle. Viruses such as SV40 and Adenovirus viruses
encode proteins that interact directly, or indirectly, with key cell cycle
proteins such as CBP300 and the retinoblastoma gene product. However, neurons do 
not have a cell cycle as we generally describe it and this is also reflected in
the difficulty in obtaining immortalised neuronal cultures. The replication
strategies of viruses that infect post-mitotic cells such as neurons may be
different from infection of other somatic cells. The life cycle for viral latency
or slow infection of neurons appears to involve silencing or restricting
expression of the viral genome until such times as dictated by the environment.
These signals from the environment usually reflect cell stress, otherwise the
cell appears to tolerate the existence of the virus genome. We will review the
genomic structure of alphaherpesviruses in neurons and transcriptional control
mechanisms that may regulate expression. Where appropriate we will contrast and
compare virus and endogenous neuronal gene expression.
