We compared four commercially available enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits for the
detection of HIV antibodies using immunoblot analysis as a confirmatory test. The
kits gave satisfactory results as far as sensitivity and specificity are
concerned as required for the use in the laboratories of blood banks. For the
sera of patients on haemodialysis, haemophiliacs, patients "under observation"
for AIDS and homosexuals the results obtained by Behring and Organon kits were
less satisfactory, as the number of false positive results was much higher than
with kits produced by Genetic and Wellcome. The frequency of false negative
results was small in the tests using Organon and Genetic kits, while using
Behring and Wellcome kits no false negative results were found.
