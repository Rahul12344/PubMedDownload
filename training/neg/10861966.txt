A multicomponent herbal formula Ledretan-96 was tested on an epithelial tissue
culture cell line (MDCK) for its protective activity against cytopathic effects
caused by influenza A virus. The whole formula and each of its 23 individual
components were tested in the same system. The results indicated that the
formula, when prepared according to established procedure, in the form of
decoction, is active in protecting epithelial cells against damage caused by
influenza A virus used at different dosages. Of the 23 components tested, only
one, Terminalia chebula, showed a significant protective effect when applied to
the epithelial cells individually. Controls for these studies included cell
cultures exposed to individual components and the complete formula without virus;
the cultures were monitored for any toxic effects by morphology and protein
synthesis. The protective effects of Ledretan-96 and Terminalia chebula could be 
distinguished from toxicity against the epithelial cells. In addition, the
results indicated that the complete formula maintained antiviral activity at a
higher therapeutic index than the Terminalia chebula extract alone.
