Since human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) was identified in 1980 as causing 
human disease, it has been etiologically associated with adult T-cell
lymphoma/leukemia (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP). More recently,
several new diseases have been reported in association with this virus, including
infective dermatitis of Jamaican children, which we reported in 1990. Studies on 
infective dermatitis have shown that these children have abnormalities of immune 
function, and some develop other HTLV-I associated disorders, including TSP. This
paper reviews the work done on infective dermatitis to date, and explores the
association with TSP.
