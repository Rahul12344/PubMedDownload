The alphaviruses and flaviviruses include many important human pathogens, such as
the dengue, West Nile, and Chikungunya viruses. These enveloped viruses infect
cells by a membrane fusion reaction triggered by the low pH in endosomes. Fusion 
is mediated by viral membrane proteins through their acid-dependent conversion
from a dimer on the virus surface to a homotrimer inserted into the host cell
membrane. Here we review recent studies on the regulatory mechanisms that silence
these fusion proteins during virus exit and that sense low pH and mediate protein
refolding during virus entry. We discuss results using truncated proteins to
dissect the fusion reaction, and future research directions including the
development of antiviral therapies against these medically important viruses.
