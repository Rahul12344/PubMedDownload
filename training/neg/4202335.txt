Pathology of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever in the rhesus monkey.

Terrell TG, Stookey JL, Eddy GA, Kastello MD.

Gross and microscopic lesions associated with Bolivan hemorrhagic fever virus
infection in the rhesus monkey were studied in 10 animals which died following
inoculation. Gross lesions included skin rash, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
meningeal edema, hydropericardium and enlarged friable livers. Hemorrhagic
manifestations of the infection were not consistently observed, but hemorrhages
were present in the skin, heart, brain and nares in some monkeys. Histopathologic
lesions were fairly consistent. Hepatic necrosis with the presence of acidophilic
hyaline bodies, necrotizing enteritis, epithelial necrosis and adrenal cortical
necrosis were present in all monkeys. Those monkeys which died after the
seventeenth day of infection had nonsupurative meningoencephalitis; lymphoid
necrosis was present in 3 monkeys that died after day 18. Other microscopic
lesions included myocardial degeneration, lymphoid and reticuloendothelial cell
hyperplasia and lymphoid depletion. Most of the histopathologic lesions described
in human autopsy material were reproduced; however, the necrosis in the skin and 
oral mucosa, mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal cortex have not
been described in man. Despite these apparent discrepancies the results of this
investigation indicate that the rhesus monkey is a good experimental model for
the study of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever infection.
