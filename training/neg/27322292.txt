A series of aminoglucoglycerolipids derivatives had been synthesized, including
6'-acylamido-glucoglycerolipids 1a-1f and corresponding
2'-acylamido-glucoglycerolipids 2a-2c bearing different fatty acids, glucosyl
diglycerides 3a-3e bearing different functional groups at C-6' and ether-linked
glucoglycerolipids 4a-4c with double-tailed alkyl alcohol. The anti-influenza A
virus (IAV) activity was evaluated by the cytopathic effects (CPE) inhibition
assay. The results indicated that the integral structure of the
aminoglycoglycerolipid was essential for the inhibition of IAV in MDCK cells.
Furthermore, oral administration of compound 1d was able to significantly improve
survival and decrease pulmonary viral titers in IAV-infected mice, which
suggested that compound 1d merited further investigation as a novel anti-IAV
candidate in the future.
