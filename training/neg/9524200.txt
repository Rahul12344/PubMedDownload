Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues in pathology archives are an important 
resource for molecular epidemiology studies. Use of these tissues requires that
assays be optimized to account for inevitable variations in tissue fixation and
processing that occur in the performance of routine histology. We compared
results of colorimetric in situ hybridization (ISH) to L1 consensus polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) for detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) in
180 blocks of archival tissues (up to 9 years in storage) from cervical cancer
patients. Fifteen samples could not be amplified by PCR, but assays were
concordant in 75.1% (124/165) of samples that could be analyzed by both methods. 
Similar numbers of ISH+/PCR- (23) and ISH-/PCR+ (18) cases were found. Eight of
the 18 ISH-/PCR+ cases were attributable to PCR detection of HPV types not
included in the ISH assay. This degree of concordance required individual
optimization of assay conditions for each block. ISH and PCR assays for HPV yield
complementary results, and both can be successfully applied to archival tissues.
