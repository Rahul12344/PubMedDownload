Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of organotypic nerve cell cultures.
Tubule-like structures in the nuclei of cells infected with type 2 but not with
type 1 virus.

Ecob-Johnston MS, Whetsell WO Jr.

In HSV-2 infected cultures, intranuclear tubule-like structures were found more
commonly in fibroblasts and central nervous system (CNS) neurons than in
oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, satellite and Schwann cells, but were found least
often in peripheral neurons.
