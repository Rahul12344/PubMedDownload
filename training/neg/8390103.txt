During the years 1990 to 1991, smears taken from the anal canal of 45 randomly
selected homosexual males were studied. Several cytological criteria were used to
study infection by human papillomavirus (HPV). The cytological study and an
anoscopy was performed and a swab was taken for HPV-DNA hybridization, using
labelled RNA probes for HPV-DNA: 6,11,16,18,31,33, and 35. In our study we
observed the existence of a high proportion (9.5%) of inadequate smears that did 
not contain glandular cells and/or metaplasia. A sensitivity of 78% and a
specificity of 72% was obtained. Sensitivity and specificity were 68% and 91%,
respectively, when these criteria were restricted to the presence of koilocytes
and/or dyskeratocytes. The high rate of occult infections obtained in our study
lead us to suggest the simultaneous use of cytology, molecular hybridization, and
anoscopy for suitable care of those patients with a high risk of contracting HPV 
infections of the anal canal.
