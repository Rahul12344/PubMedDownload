Study results of passive natural immunity anti-measles, and immune response to
measles vaccine from different strains in Mexican children under one year old,
are described in this paper. Mexican infants in these studies ended their
maternal immunity at 8-10 months of age. Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) vaccine strain had
higher seroconversion rates comparing to Schwarz strain. Dose response effect was
more closely related to Schwarz strain than EZ, since difference in
seroconversion rates with standard, medium and high doses were statistically
significant. However geometric mean post-vaccination titers were higher in
children vaccinated with Schwarz strain, than EZ receptors.
