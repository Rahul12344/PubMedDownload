BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is prominent in
Cantonese Chinese people. It is presumed to result from an interaction of genetic
and environmental factors, including the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In an attempt 
to further clarify the pathogenesis of this disease, an evaluation of NPC
occurring in racial/ethnic groups not considered susceptible to this disease
could be informative.
METHODS: A white family with NPC occurring in three siblings was investigated and
information was gleaned from literature on other reports of familial NPC in
non-Chinese families.
RESULTS: In the family being investigated, another genetically determined
disease, hemophilia, was identified. Radiation early in life was noted to be a
possible risk factor for NPC in the proband. A review of familial NPC in the
white population revealed that in contrast to sporadic NPC, which is usually of
the well-differentiated type, familial NPC usually is poorly differentiated.
CONCLUSIONS: Familial NPC offers an important opportunity to investigate the
etiology of this disease. With newer laboratory techniques to investigate
pathogenetic mechanisms, detailed evaluations of non-Chinese NPC families may
become increasingly important.
