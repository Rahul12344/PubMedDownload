Four lactococcal abortive infection mechanisms were introduced into strains which
were sensitive hosts for P335 type phages and plaque assay experiments performed 
to assess their effect on five lactococcal bacteriophages from this family.
Results indicate that AbiA inhibits all five P335 phages tested, while AbiG
affects phiP335 itself and phiQ30 but not the other P335 species phages. AbiA was
shown to retard phage Q30 DNA replication as previously reported for other
phages. It was also demonstrated that AbiG, previously shown to act at a point
after DNA replication in the cases of c2 type and 936 type phages, acts at the
level of, or prior to phage Q30 DNA replication. AbiE and AbiF had no effect on
the P335 type phages examined.
