The genome of Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage B103 consists of double-stranded
linear DNA 18,630 bp long. The DNA was sequenced, and the sequence was compared
with DNA sequences of closely related phages, namely the members of the phage
phi29 family. Among them, phage Nf was shown to be the most closely related to
B103. Comparisons of several open reading frames (ORFs) among the family members 
helped to identify genes 1 and 5. A cluster of ORFs between genes 16 and 17
contains two ORFs with partial homology with two phi29 ORFs located in the same
region. There are three more ORFs in this region of B103 with good ribosome
binding sites (RBS) and optimal codon usage that are not homologous to any of the
phi29 ORFs. The function of these five ORFs remains unexplained. It was shown
that major promoters characterized in phi29 are retained in B103. Where many
substitutions occur in the vicinity of a promoter, at least the -10 and -35 boxes
are conserved.
