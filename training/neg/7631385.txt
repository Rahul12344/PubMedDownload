BACKGROUND: Canada's publicly funded blood system has recently introduced
high-purity concentrates as the standard treatment for individuals with
hemophilia. The added cost and the need to document patient outcomes have
prompted the consideration of a national blood product monitoring system.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study investigates the suitability of the Canadian
Hemophilia Registry (CHR) as the basis of such a monitoring system by assessing
the degree to which it represents users of factor concentrates.
RESULTS: Currently, there are 1978 individuals registered with the CHR, of whom
1594 (81%) have hemophilia A and 384 (19%) have hemophilia B. The total
prevalence is 7.2 per 10(5) population, with the prevalence of severe cases being
2.3 per 10(5). This overall prevalence is similar to that seen in other countries
with national registries. The CHR national prevalence also compares favorably
with that in the province of Quebec, where registration of users of blood
products is compulsory. The CHR figures indicate that the number of persons
currently infected with human immunodeficiency virus, both alive and dead, is
652, which is similar to the number of applicants (658) to the federal
government's assistance program. The registry is stable, and the number of
persons with severe cases, other than young children, newly registered or lost to
follow-up during the last 2 years is very small.
CONCLUSION: The CHR includes the vast majority of factor concentrate users and is
therefore ideal as the basis for a national monitoring system.
