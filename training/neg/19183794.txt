Here we describe a new DNA capture element (DCE) sensing system, based on the
quenching and dequenching of a double-stranded aptamer. This system shows very
good sensitivity and thermal stability. While quenching, dequenching, and
separating the DCE systems made from different aptamers (all selected by SELEX), 
an alternative method to rapidly select aptamers was developed-the Aptamer
Selection Express (ASExp). This process has been used to select aptamers against 
different types of targets (Bacillus anthracis spores, Bacillus thuringiensis
spores, MS-2 bacteriophage, ovalbumin, and botulinum neurotoxin). The DCE systems
made from botulinum neurotoxin aptamers selected by ASExp have been investigated.
The results of this investigation indicate that ASExp can be used to rapidly
select aptamers for the DCE sensing system.
