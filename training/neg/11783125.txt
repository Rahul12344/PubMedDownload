OBJECTIVE: To clarify the frequency, the routes of transmission from mother to
infant, the correlation factors and distribution of genotypes of transfusion
transmitted virus (TTV) infection.
METHODS: Nested-polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) was performed to detect TTV DNA
and genotypes in serums and breast milks from 160 cases of pregnant women.
RESULTS: TTV DNA in serum and breast milk was detected in 64 (40.0%) and 60
(37.5%) of 160 cases of pregnant women respectively. The positive rates of TTV
DNA from HBV markers (+) and normal groups were 50.0%, 43.1% and 13.6%, 22.7%
respectively in serums and breast milk. There were significant difference between
the two groups (P < 0.05). The TTV genotypes were type I in all 124 samples of
TTV DNA detected.
CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is common in the pregnant women and a high prevalence 
of TTV infection in pregnant women with positive HBV markers has been
demonstrated. TTV infection is correlated with HBV. TTV is probably transmitted
from mother to their children by breast feeding. All of TTV genotypes detected in
pregnant women is genotype I.
