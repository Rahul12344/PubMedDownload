In previous work we transferred a human factor IX-encoding adeno-associated viral
vector (AAV) into skeletal muscle of men with severe hemophilia B. Biopsy of
injected muscle up to 1 year after vector injection showed evidence of gene
transfer by Southern blot and of protein expression by IHC and immunofluorescent 
staining. Although the procedure appeared safe, circulating F.IX levels remained 
subtherapeutic (< 1%). Recently, we obtained muscle tissue from a subject
injected 10 years earlier who died of causes unrelated to gene transfer. Using
Western blot, IHC, and immunofluorescent staining, we show persistent factor IX
expression in injected muscle tissue. F.IX transcripts were detected in injected 
skeletal muscle using RT-PCR, and isolated whole genomic DNA tested positive for 
the presence of the transferred AAV vector sequence. This is the longest reported
transgene expression to date from a parenterally administered AAV vector, with
broad implications for the future of muscle-directed gene transfer.
