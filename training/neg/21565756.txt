Subsequent studies have implicated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein in
the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis. Chronic HCV infection may also cause
steatosis by impairing fatty acid oxidation. There is relationship between
accumulation of fat into the liver and overweight and/or obesity. Another
unexpected virus-host interaction is the HCV infection and diabetes. HCV encoded 
proteins might alter insulin signaling thus explaining impaired insulin
sensitivity and the occurrence of glycaemic dysregulation. Some pieces of the
puzzle are still not well known; e.g. the factors and the spectrum of disorders
associated with insulin resistance, and whether the liver is a trigger or target 
of metabolic syndrome? In this review article clinical consequence of chronic HCV
infection, diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis are discussed, as well as
their possible effects on antiviral therapy.
