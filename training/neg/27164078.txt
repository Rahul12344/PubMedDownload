The majority of carcinomas that were developed due to the infection with human
papillomavirus (HPV) are caused by high-risk HPV types, HPV16 and HPV18. These
HPV types contain the E6 and E7 oncogenes, so the fast detection of these
oncogenes is an important point to avoid the development of cancer. Many
different HPV tests are available to detect the presence of HPV in biological
samples. The aim of this study was to design a fast and low cost method for HPV
identification employing magnetic isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
electrochemical detection. These assays were developed to detect the interactions
between E6-HPV16 oncogene and magnetizable particles (MPs) using commercial
Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin particles and laboratory-synthesized "homemade"
particles called MANs (MAN-37, MAN-127 and MAN-164). The yields of PCR
amplification of E6-HPV16 oncogene bound on the particles and after the elution
from the particles were compared. A highest yield of E6-HPV16 DNA isolation was
obtained with both MPs particles commercial M-280 Streptavidin and MAN-37 due to 
reducing of the interferents compared with the standard PCR method. A biosensor
employing the isolation of E6-HPV16 oncogene with MPs particles followed by its
electrochemical detection can be a very effective technique for HPV
identification, providing simple, sensitive and cost-effective analysis.
