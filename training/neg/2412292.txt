Mutations have been identified in variants of poliovirus, type 1 (Mahoney) on the
basis of their resistance to neutralization by individual monoclonal antibodies. 
The phenotypes of these variants were defined in terms of antibody binding; the
pattern of epitopes expressed or able to be exploited for neutralization were
complex. Single amino acid changes can have distant (in terms of linear sequence)
and generalized effects on the antigenic structure of poliovirus and similarly
constituted virions.
