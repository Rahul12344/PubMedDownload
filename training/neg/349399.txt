Correlation of animal brain tumor models with human neuro-oncology.

Rubinstein LJ.

The paper reviews the histopathology and cytopathology of a number of
experimental animal brain tumor models to determine their relevance to human
neuro-oncology. The models discussed include brain tumors produced by local
implants of carcinogenic hydrocarbons and by the administration of resorptive
N-nitroso compounds, some of the cell lines derived from the latter, tumors
resulting from the intracerebral inoculation of oncogenic viruses, and the
differentiating neuroepithelial component of a transplantable mouse teratoma. The
structural and biochemical criteria that can be applied for the identification of
the various stages of neuronal and glial cell maturation are highly precise. They
reveal a wide diversity of tumor cell types that are now available in
experimental neuro-oncogenesis.
