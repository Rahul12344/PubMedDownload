Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is an infrequent cause of meningitis in adults,
usually affecting elderly patients and those with serious underlying disease. It 
is more commonly recognised as one of the leading aetiological agents of neonatal
sepsis following maternally derived infection during pregnancy. We report a case 
of a previously healthy 26-year-old man who presented with fevers, confusion and 
headache. Lumbar puncture results were consistent with bacterial meningitis, and 
blood cultures grew GBS. To the best of our knowledge, our patient represents one
of the few reported cases of GBS meningitis in a previously healthy young man.
Interestingly, our patient had a significant family history of central nervous
system infection including a son with herpes simplex virus encephalitis, a sister
with meningococcal meningitis and a great-uncle with meningitis of unknown cause.
We discuss genetic factors that may predispose certain people to develop
meningitis with normally harmless microorganisms such as GBS.
