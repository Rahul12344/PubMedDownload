Diarrhea among infants and young children in Canada: a longitudinal study in
three northern communities.

Gurwith M, Wenman W, Gurwith D, Brunton J, Feltham S, Greenberg H.

Diarrhea among neonates and their siblings was studied in 98 families living in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and in 31 native Indian families and in 15 Inuit (Eskimo)
families living in isolated settlements in northern Canada. The rate of infection
due to rotavirus in neonates was significantly higher and infection occurred more
often in the first six months of life in the northern communities (range, 0.36 in
Winnipeg to 1.07 in Eskimo Point). No protective effect of breast-feeding was
discerned, since infection due to rotavirus occurred more frequently and earliest
in neonatal life in Eskimo Point, the community with the highest rate of
breast-feeding. In contrast, infection due to Norwalk virus was most common among
the neonates of Berens River (0.15 infections per child per year), the only
community with relatively unsafe water supplies. Infection due to rotavirus
appears to be more frequent in the far North, whereas infection due to Norwalk
virus appears to be related more to inadequate sanitation.
