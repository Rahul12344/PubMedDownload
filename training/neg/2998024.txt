Effect of tunicamycin on the development of the cytopathic effect in Sindbis
virus-infected avian fibroblasts.

Ulug ET, Bose HR Jr.

In Sindbis virus-infected avian cells the development of the cytopathic effect is
correlated with the disruption of plasma membrane function. Sindbis virus
inhibits the activity of the Na+K+ATPase, a membrane-associated enzyme complex
which regulates intracellular monovalent cation levels. Tunicamycin, which blocks
envelope protein glycosylation, prevents inhibition of Na+K+ATPase activity and
the development of morphological changes in Sindbis virus-infected cells.
Although inhibition of Na+K+ATPase activity is not essential for the termination 
of host protein synthesis, membrane-mediated events may favor the selective
translation of viral proteins. The termination of host protein synthesis does not
contribute to the development of these cytopathic changes in the time frame
examined. In tunicamycin-treated, Sindbis virus-infected cells, unglycosylated E1
is inserted into the plasma membrane but virus release is prevented. In
productively infected cells, therefore, the inhibition of Na+K+ATPase activity
and the development of the cytopathic effect may result from terminal events in
virus assembly and/or virus release.
