A TaqMan-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was devised for
the detection of porcine parvovirus (PPV). Two primers and a TaqMan probe for the
non-structural protein NS1 gene were designed. The detection limit was 1 x 10²
DNA copies/μL, and the assay was linear in the range of 1 x 10² to 1 x 10⁹
copies/μL. There was no cross-reaction with porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), porcine 
reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV),
classical swine fever virus (CSFV), or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The
assay was specific and reproducible. In 41 clinical samples, PPV was detected in 
32 samples with the real-time PCR assay and in only 11 samples with a
conventional PCR assay. The real-time assay using the TaqMan-system can therefore
be practically used for studying the epidemiology and management of PPV.
