Molecular details and temporal organization of the early (preintegration) phase
of HIV life cycle remain among the least investigated and most controversial
problems in the biology of HIV. To accomplish reverse transcription and
intracellular transport of the viral genetic material, HIV forms multi-molecular 
complexes termed reverse transcription complexes (RTCs). Analysis of the kinetics
of reverse transcription and nuclear import of RTCs, as well as assessment of the
changes in their protein content in the course of reverse transcription and
nuclear translocation is a necessary step in understanding the mechanisms of
cytoplasmic maturation and nuclear import of HIV-1 RTCs. Here, we review methods 
that allow quantitative assessment of the dynamics of the maturation of HIV-1
RTCs and transformations of RTC protein composition associated with nuclear
import of the complexes.
