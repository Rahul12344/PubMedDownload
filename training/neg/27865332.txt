Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), and questioning youth represent a
diverse population who are affected by many sexual health inequities, including
increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted
infections (STIs). To provide comprehensive sexual health care for LGBT youth,
providers should set the stage with a nonjudgmental, respectful tone. Providers
should be competent in recognizing symptoms of STIs and HIV and aware of the most
up-to-date screening guidelines for LGBT youth. Sexual health visits should also 
focus on prevention, including safer sex practices, HIV pre-exposure and
post-exposure prophylaxis, family planning, and immunization for hepatitis and
human papillomavirus.
