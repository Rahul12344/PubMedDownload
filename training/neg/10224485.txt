Disseminated herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infections are infrequent in
patients receiving organ transplants, but usually have a poor outcome. We
describe the case of a renal transplant patient who developed a disseminated
HSV-2 infection with repeated urinary extravasations. The diagnosis was carried
out using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction nested assay and it suggested
HSV-2 as a possible cause of repeated urinary fistulas.
