Recombinant protein rNS3 imitating helicase region (1356-1459 amino acid
residues) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was expressed in E. coli cells and used for 
BALB/c mice immunization. Seven hybrydoma clones producing monoclonal antibodies 
(MAbs) to rHS3 were obtained. All MAbs reacted in ELISA with NS3 protein from
Murex anti-HCV Version III and in immunoblotting from RIBA 3. These MAbs detect 5
individual epitopes, 4 of which were conformational and 1 discontinuous. All MAbs
could compete for rNS3 binding with serum antibodies from patients with chronic
hepatitis C, which suggests that these MAbs can recognize the natural HCV NS3
protein.
