BACKGROUND: Ebola virus (EBOV), variant Makona, was the causative agent of the
2013-2016 West African epidemic responsible for almost 30,000 human infections
and over 11,000 fatalities. During the epidemic, the development of several
experimental vaccines was accelerated through human clinical trials. One of them,
the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine VSV-EBOV, showed promising
efficacy in a phase 3 clinical trial in Guinea and is currently used in the
ongoing EBOV outbreak in the northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo (DRC). This vaccine expresses the EBOV-Kikwit glycoprotein from the 1995
outbreak as the immunogen.
METHODS: Here we generated a VSV-based vaccine expressing the contemporary
EBOV-Makona glycoprotein. We characterized the vaccine in tissue culture and
analyzed vaccine efficacy in the cynomolgus macaque model. Subsequently, we
determined the dose-dependent protective efficacy in nonhuman primates against
lethal EBOV challenge.
FINDINGS: We observed complete protection from disease with VSV-EBOV doses
ranging from 1 × 107 to 1 × 101 plaque-forming units. Some protected animals
receiving lower vaccine doses developed temporary low-level EBOV viremia. Control
animals developed classical EBOV disease and reached euthanasia criteria within a
week after challenge. This study demonstrates that very low doses of VSV-EBOV
uniformly protect macaques against lethal EBOV challenge.
INTERPRETATION: Our study provides missing pre-clinical data supporting the use
of reduced VSV-EBOV vaccine doses without decreasing protective efficacy and at
the same time increase vaccine safety and availability - two critical concerns in
public health response.
