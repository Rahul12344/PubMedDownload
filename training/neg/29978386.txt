Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection causing acute and chronic hepatitis is a
serious problem worldwide, whereas the current treatment methods are
unsatisfactory. Traditional Chinese herbs that have long been used for medicinal 
purposes are fascinating sources for novel anti-HBV candidates. This paper
summarizes the progress of anti-HBV constituents from diverse medicinal plants in
China to provide information for searching new anti-HBV drugs from natural
sources.
