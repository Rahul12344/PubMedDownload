Rotavirus entry into a cell is a complex multistep process in which different
domains of the rotavirus surface proteins interact with different cell surface
molecules, which act as attachment and entry receptors. These recently described 
molecules include several integrins and a heat shock protein, which have been
found to be associated with cell membrane lipid microdomains. The requirement
during viral entry for several cell molecules, which might be required to be
present and organized in a precise fashion, could explain the selective cell and 
tissue tropism of these viruses. This review focuses on recent data describing
the virus-receptor interactions, the role of lipid microdomains in rotavirus
infection and the mechanism of rotavirus cell entry.
