This Letter reports on the remarkable selectivity of capsid proteins for
packaging synthetic polyelectrolytes in viruslike particles. By applying the
contrast variation method in small-angle neutron scattering, we accurately
estimated the mean mass of packaged polyelectrolytes ⟨Mp⟩ and that of the
surrounding capsid ⟨Mcap⟩. Remarkably, the mass ratio ⟨Mp⟩/⟨Mcap⟩ was invariant
for polyelectrolyte molecular weights spanning more than 2 orders of magnitude.
To do so, capsids either packaged several chains simultaneously or selectively
retained the shortest chains that could fit the capsid interior. Our data are in 
qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions based on free energy
minimization and emphasize the importance of protein self-energy. These findings 
may give new insights into the nonspecific origin of genome selectivity for a
number of viral systems.
