Two members of the Benyviridae family and genus Benyvirus, Beet soil-borne mosaic
virus (BSBMV) and Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV), possess identical
genome organization, host range and high sequence similarity; they infect Beta
vulgaris with variable symptom expression. In the US, mixed infections are
described with limited information about viral interactions. Vectors suitable for
agroinoculation of all genome components of both viruses were constructed by
isothermal in vitro recombination. All 35S promoter-driven cDNA clones allowed
production of recombinant viruses competent for Nicotiana benthamiana and Beta
macrocarpa systemic infection and Polymyxa betae transmission and were compared
to available BNYVV B-type clone. BNYVV and BSBMV RNA1 + 2 reassortants were
viable and spread long-distance in N. benthamiana with symptoms dependent on the 
BNYVV type. Small genomic RNAs were exchangeable and systemically infected B.
macrocarpa. These infectious clones represent a powerful tool for the
identification of specific molecular host-pathogen determinants.
