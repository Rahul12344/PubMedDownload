Inhibition of cardiolipin synthesis following infection with herpes simplex
virus.

Tucker T, Steiner MR, Steiner S.

The results of this study show that the synthesis of the inner mitochondrial
membrane phospholipid, cardiolipin, is markedly inhibited following infection of 
human embryonic lung or hamster embryo fibroblast cells with herpes simplex virus
type 1 or 2. The synthesis of other phospholipids, i.e., phosphatidylcholine,
phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylinositol, is relatively 
unaffected.
