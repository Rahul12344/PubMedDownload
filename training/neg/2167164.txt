Neoplastic transformation of rat liver cells in vitro by DNA-mediated gene
transfer with an oncogene, hhcM, derived from human (Mahlavu) hepatocellular
carcinoma, is described and compared with that of NIH3T3 cells. hhcM was cloned
in a neomycin-resistant simian virus 40 promoter vector (pNeor/S) and was
designated pNrpM-1. BRL-1 or NIH3T3 cells, transfected with pNrpM-1 DNA, showed
significant morphological changes, loss of contact inhibition, and
anchorage-independent growth. They became highly tumorigenic in nude rats and
nu/nu mice. Control BRL-1 and NIH3T3 cells, whether transfected with pNeor/S DNA 
or not, remained contact inhibited and nontumorigenic. Both the transformants and
the tumor cells contained integrated hhcM DNA as shown by Southern blot
hybridization. The complete nucleotide sequence of the hhcM 3.0-kilobase DNA was 
also determined, and it consisted of a possible open reading frame for a protein 
of 52 kilodaltons (467 amino acids). The high-level production of a slightly
modified form of this 52-kilodalton protein in a bacterial expression system has 
been successfully achieved. The bacteria-produced protein was similar in
electrophoretic behavior to the 52- to 53-kilodalton protein synthesized in a
cell-free translation system using rabbit reticulocyte lysate programmed with
hybrid-selected hhcM-specific mRNA from Mahlavu hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
