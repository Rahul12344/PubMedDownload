Following entry and reverse transcription, the HIV-1 genome is integrated into
the host genome. In contrast to productively infected cells, latently infected
cells frequently harbor HIV-1 genomes integrated in heterochromatic structures,
allowing persistence of transcriptionally silent proviruses. Microglial cells are
the main HIV-1 target cells in the central nervous system and constitute an
important reservoir for viral pathogenesis. In the present work, we show that, in
microglial cells, the co-repressor COUP-TF interacting protein 2 (CTIP2) recruits
a multienzymatic chromatin-modifying complex and establishes a heterochromatic
environment at the HIV-1 promoter. We report that CTIP2 recruits histone
deacetylase (HDAC)1 and HDAC2 to promote local histone H3 deacetylation at the
HIV-1 promoter region. In addition, DNA-bound CTIP2 also associates with the
histone methyltransferase SUV39H1, which increases local histone H3 lysine 9
methylation. This allows concomitant recruitment of HP1 proteins to the viral
promoter and formation of local heterochromatin, leading to HIV-1 silencing.
Altogether, our findings uncover new therapeutic opportunities for purging latent
HIV-1 viruses from their cellular reservoirs.
