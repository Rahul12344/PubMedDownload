Human T-cell leukaemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) infection causes adult T-cell
leukaemia (ATL). The viral protein HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is constitutively
expressed in ATL cells, suggesting that HBZ plays a major role in the
pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated disease. Here, we identified centromere protein
B (CENP-B) as a novel interacting partner of HBZ. HBZ and CENP-B associate with
their central regions in cells. Furthermore, overexpression of HBZ abrogated the 
DNA-binding activity of CENP-B to the α-satellite DNA region containing the
CENP-B box motif, which in turn inhibited the CENP-B-mediated trimethylation of
histone H3K9 in T-cells.
