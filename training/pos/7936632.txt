Tax protein of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) enhances transcription
of several cellular genes through activation of a specific enhancer, the NF-kappa
B binding site. We found previously that Tax binds to NF-kappa B p50, which is a 
member of the Rel/NF-kappa B family proteins, and associates with the DNA
sequence of the NF-kappa B binding site. In the present study, we tested other
NF-kappa B family proteins and found that NF-kappa B p65 and c-Rel proteins also 
bind to Tax and that their complexes with Tax bind to the DNA sequence of the
NF-kappa B binding site. The Tax binding site on NF-kappa B p50 is the Rel
homology domain, which is conserved in the Rel/NF-kappa B family proteins. The
formations of these complexes by Tax mutants were well correlated with their
transactivating capacities. In F9 embryonic carcinoma cells, Tax enhanced
transcription synergistically with NF-kappa B p65 or c-Rel. Thus Tax interacts
with the Rel homology domain of Rel/NF-kappa B family proteins which bind to the 
NF-kappa B binding site and activates transcription.
