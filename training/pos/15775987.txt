Like tumor cells, DNA viruses have had to evolve mechanisms that uncouple
cellular replication from the many intra- and extracellular factors that normally
control it. Here we show that adenovirus encodes two proteins that activate the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) for viral replication, even under
nutrient/growth factor-limiting conditions. E4-ORF1 mimics growth factor
signaling by activating PI3-kinase, resulting in increased Rheb.GTP loading and
mTOR activation. E4-ORF4 is redundant with glucose in stimulating mTOR, does not 
affect Rheb.GTP levels and is the major mechanism whereby adenovirus activates
mTOR in quiescent primary cells. We demonstrate that mTOR is activated through a 
mechanism that is dependent on the E4-ORF4 protein phosphatase 2A-binding domain.
We also show that mTOR activation is required for efficient S-phase entry,
independently of E2F activation, in adenovirus-infected quiescent primary cells. 
These data reveal that adenovirus has evolved proteins that activate the mTOR
pathway, irrespective of the cellular microenvironment, and which play a
requisite role in viral replication.
