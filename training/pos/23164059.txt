BACKGROUND: Unintegrated HIV-1 DNA serves as transcriptionally active templates
in HIV-infected cells. Several host factors including NF-κβ enhance HIV-1
transcription. HIV-1 induced NF-κβ activation can be suppressed by viral protein 
U (Vpu). Interestingly HIV-1 Vpu shares amino acid homology with cellular
Twik-related Acid Sensitive K+ (TASK) channel 1 and the proteins physically
interact in cultured cells and AIDS lymphoid tissue. Furthermore, the first
transmembrane domain of TASK-1 is functionally interchangeable with Vpu and like 
Vpu enhances HIV-1 release.
RESULTS: Here we further characterize the role of TASK channels and Vpu in HIV-1 
replication. We demonstrate that both TASK channels and Vpu can preferentially
inhibit transcription of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. Interestingly, TASK-1 ion
channel function is not required and suppression of HIV-1 transcription by TASK-1
and Vpu was reversed by overexpression of RelA (NF-κβ p65).
CONCLUSION: TASK proteins and Vpu suppress transcription of unintegrated HIV-1
DNA through an NF-κβ-dependent mechanism. Taken together these findings support a
possible physiological role for HIV-1 Vpu and TASK proteins as modulators of
transcription of unintegrated HIV-1 DNA genomes.
