A class of strict late Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) promoters contains a
conserved sequence element (termed the downstream activation sequence, DAS)
located downstream of the transcription start site. These DAS-containing
promoters also require both a TATA box and an initiator element for maximal
levels of transcription. In this communication, we demonstrate that the
downstream promoter element (DPE) found on a class of Drosophila TATA-less
promoters and known to bind the homologue of human TAF(II)70 (a component of
TFIID), can functionally substitute for DAS in the context of the strict late
UL38 promoter in spite of no obvious sequence similarity. Although Drosophila
DPE-containing promoters do not require a TATA box, the element does not remove
the requirement for a TATA box when functioning in the HSV promoter. Next, we
demonstrate that hTAF(II)70, interacts in a sequence specific manner with DAS as 
predicted from the fact that DPE binds Drosophila TBP. These results suggest that
multiple TFIID/promoter interactions are important in the activation of HSV-1
late gene expression upon viral DNA replication. We propose that such
interactions could be favored upon viral DNA replication since TFIID concentrates
to viral transcription foci that form during the later stages of infection.
