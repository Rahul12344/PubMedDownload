BS69 is a transcriptional co-repressor protein and a potential tumor suppressor
that binds to the adenoviral oncoprotein E1A. We show that the C-terminal Mynd
domain of BS69 (amino acids 516-561) or the closely related Mynd domains of the
Caenorhabditis elegans proteins Bra-1 and Bra-2 bind not only to E1A but also to 
the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 oncoprotein and the Myc-related cellular protein
MGA. Interaction depends on intact PXLXP motifs present in all three proteins.
Moreover, viral proteins compete for binding of BS69 to MGA in a PXLXP-dependent 
fashion. Because deletions in E1A or EBNA2 that cover the PXLXP motifs are
non-transforming, our observations suggest a role for BS69 in cell growth control
that is reminiscent of abrogation of the Rb function by various oncoproteins.
