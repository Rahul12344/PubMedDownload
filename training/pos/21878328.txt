Hepatitis B viral X protein (HBx) is a multifunctional transactivator and
implicated in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication and hepatocarcinogenesis. HBx
can be ubiquitinated and degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, 
the E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating HBx ubiquitin-dependent degradation is still
unknown. In this study, we identified Siah-1 as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for
HBx, which interacted with HBx and facilitated HBx poly-ubiquitylation and
proteasomal degradation. Co-expression of Siah-1 attenuated the transcriptional
transactivation of HBx on glucocorticoid response element (GRE), heat shock
response element (HSE) and cAMP response element (CRE) signal pathways. Moreover,
Siah-1 participated in p53-mediated HBx degradation. Therefore, Siah-1 may play
important roles in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of HBx and may be involved in 
suppressing the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
