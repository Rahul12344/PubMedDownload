Oncoproteins from DNA tumor viruses associate with critical cellular proteins to 
regulate cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation. Human papillomavirus 
(HPV) E6 oncoproteins have been previously shown to associate with a cellular
HECT domain ubiquitin ligase termed E6AP (UBE3A). Here we show that the E6-E6AP
complex associates with and targets the degradation of the protein tyrosine
phosphatase PTPN3 (PTPH1) in vitro and in living cells. PTPN3 is a
membrane-associated tyrosine phosphatase with FERM, PDZ, and PTP domains
previously implicated in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of growth factor
receptors and p97 VCP (valosin-containing protein, termed Cdc48 in Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae) and is mutated in a subset of colon cancers. Degradation of PTPN3 by 
E6 requires E6AP, the proteasome, and an interaction between the carboxy terminus
of E6 and the PDZ domain of PTPN3. In transduced keratinocytes, E6 confers
reduced growth factor requirements, a function that requires the PDZ ligand of E6
and that can in part be replicated by inhibiting the expression of PTPN3. This
report demonstrates the potential of E6 to regulate phosphotyrosine metabolism
through the targeted degradation of a tyrosine phosphatase.
