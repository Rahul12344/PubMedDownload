The extracellular region of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) is
predicted to consist of two immunoglobulin (Ig)-related structural domains. We
expressed the isolated CAR amino-terminal domain (D1) and a CAR fragment
containing both extracellular Ig domains (D1/D2) in Escherichia coli. Both D1 and
D1/D2 formed complexes in vitro with the recombinant knob domain of adenovirus
type 12 (Ad12) fiber, and D1 inhibited adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) infection of HeLa 
cells. These results indicate that the adenovirus-binding activity of CAR is
localized in the amino-terminal IgV-related domain and confirm our earlier
observation that Ad2 and Ad12 bind to the same cellular receptor. Preliminary
crystallization studies suggest that complexes of Ad12 knob bound to D1 will be
suitable for structure determination.
