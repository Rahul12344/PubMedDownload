Previously, we identified human liver endonexin II (EII) present on human
hepatocyte plasma membrane as a specific hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)
binding protein. We also showed the spontaneous development of anti-idiotypic
(anti-HBsAg) antibodies in rabbits immunized with EII and in chicken immunized
with the F(ab')2 fragment of rabbit anti-EII IgG. These findings suggest the
existence of a receptor-ligand relationship between EII and HBsAg. In the present
study, we demonstrate that small HBsAg conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold also
binds specifically to human hepatocytes. Invagination of the coated pit region at
the HBsAg binding sites on the human hepatocyte plasma membrane results in the
internalization of the HBsAg-gold particles. The binding and consequently the
internalization of HBsAg is inhibited by anti-EII or anti-idiotypic (anti-HBsAg) 
antibodies. These findings indicate that EII is directly involved in the binding 
and uptake of hepatitis B envelope proteins.
