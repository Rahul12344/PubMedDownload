Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx protein) is a multifunctional regulatory
protein. The transactivation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) by HBx protein has
been shown to be of importance in the pathogenesis of HBV-related diseases.
However, the mechanism involved remains largely unclear. In this study, a
CytoTrap yeast two-hybrid system was employed to screen binding partners of the
HBx protein; 29 cellular proteins, including valosin-containing protein (VCP),
were identified. The interaction between HBx protein and VCP was further
confirmed in vitro and in vivo using a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay 
and co-immunoprecipitation, respectively. It was also shown that this interaction
is mediated by amino acid residues 51-120 of the HBx protein. In Huh-7 hepatoma
cells, HBx protein enhanced the VCP-mediated activation of NF-κB. Our findings
provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that lead to the activation of
NF-κB by HBx protein.
