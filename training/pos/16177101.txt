The Nef protein of HIV-1 is essential for its pathogenicity and is known to
down-regulate MHC expression on infected cell surfaces. We now show that Nef also
redistributes the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 away from the cell
surface in the human monocytic U937 cell line as well as in mouse macrophages and
dendritic cells. Furthermore, HIV-1-infected U937 cells and human blood-derived
macrophages show a similar loss of cell surface CD80 and CD86. Nef colocalizes
with MHC class I (MHCI), CD80, and CD86 in intracellular compartments, and binds 
to both mouse and human CD80 and CD86. Some Nef mutants defective in MHCI
down-modulation, including one from a clinical isolate, remain capable of
down-modulating CD80 and CD86. Nef-mediated loss of surface CD80/CD86 is
functionally significant, because it leads to compromised activation of naive T
cells. This novel immunomodulatory role of Nef may be of potential importance in 
explaining the correlations of macrophage-tropism and Nef with HIV-1
pathogenicity and immune evasion.
