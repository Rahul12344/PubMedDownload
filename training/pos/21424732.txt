In the present study, seven novel host cell factors associated with VP22 were
identified from the human leukocyte cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid
high-throughput screening system. To confirm some of the interactions, VP22 and
its homologues and two candidate targets were tagged with enhanced cyan or yellow
fluorescent protein. While RING finger protein 10 (RNF10), WD repeat-containing
protein 42A (WDR42A) or VP22 alone showed distinct subcellular localization
patterns, RNF10 and WDR42A were relocated when co-expressed with VP22 or its
homologues. Thus, these potential host cell factors of VP22 might expand the list
of the host targets of VP22.
