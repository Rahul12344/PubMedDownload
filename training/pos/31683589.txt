Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV)
is one of the most common viral infections in the world. Reactivation of HBV
infection is a life-threatening condition observed in patients with CHB receiving
chemotherapy or other medications. Although HBV reactivation is commonly
attributed to immune suppression, other factors have long been suspected to play 
a role, including intracellular signaling activated in response to DNA damage. We
investigated the effects of DNA-damaging factors (doxorubicin and hydrogen
peroxide) on HBV reactivation/replication and the consequent DNA-damage response.
Dose-dependent activation of HBV replication was observed in response to
doxorubicin and hydrogen peroxide which was associated with a marked elevation in
the mRNA levels of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and RAD3-related 
(ATR) kinases. Downregulation of ATM or ATR expression by shRNAs substantially
reduced the levels of HBV RNAs and DNA. In contrast, transcriptional activation
of ATM or ATR using CRISPRa significantly increased HBV replication. We conclude 
that ATM and ATR are essential for HBV replication. Furthermore, DNA damage
leading to the activation of ATM and ATR transcription, results in the
reactivation of HBV replication.
