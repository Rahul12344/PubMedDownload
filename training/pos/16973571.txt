The NSs protein of Bunyamwera virus (Bunyaviridae) is an antiapoptotic interferon
antagonist involved in silencing host protein expression by interfering with mRNA
synthesis. Here, we show that the ability to inhibit both host transcription and 
the interferon response is linked to interaction of NSs with the MED8 component
of Mediator, a protein complex necessary for mRNA production. The interacting
domain on NSs was mapped to the C-terminal region, which contains amino acids
conserved among orthobunyavirus NSs proteins. A recombinant virus in which the
interacting domain in NSs was deleted had strongly reduced ability to inhibit
host protein expression and was unable to inhibit the interferon response. This
study provides further information on the mechanisms by which bunyavirus
nonstructural proteins are involved in pathogenesis.
