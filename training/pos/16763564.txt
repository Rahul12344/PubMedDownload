We have determined distinct roles for different proteasome complexes in
adenovirus (Ad) E1A-dependent transcription. We show that the 19S ATPase, S8, as 
a component of 19S ATPase proteins independent of 20S (APIS), binds specifically 
to the E1A transactivation domain, conserved region 3 (CR3). Recruitment of APIS 
to CR3 enhances the ability of E1A to stimulate transcription from viral early
gene promoters during Ad infection of human cells. The ability of CR3 to
stimulate transcription in yeast is similarly dependent on the functional
integrity of yeast APIS components, Sug1 and Sug2. The 20S proteasome is also
recruited to CR3 independently of APIS and the 26S proteasome. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation reveals that E1A, S8 and the 20S proteasome are recruited to 
both Ad early region gene promoters and early region gene sequences during Ad
infection, suggesting their requirement in both transcriptional initiation and
elongation. We also demonstrate that E1A CR3 transactivation and degradation
sequences functionally overlap and that proteasome inhibitors repress E1A
transcription. Taken together, these data demonstrate distinct roles for APIS and
the 20S proteasome in E1A-dependent transactivation.
