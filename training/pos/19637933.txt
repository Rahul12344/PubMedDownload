Vaccinia virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, is the prototype of the
Orthopoxvirus genus, which includes several pathogenic poxviruses of humans, such
as monkeypox virus and variola virus. Here, we report a comprehensive yeast
two-hybrid (Y2H) screening for the protein-protein interactions between vaccinia 
and human proteins. A total of 109 novel vaccinia-human protein interactions were
detected among 33 viral proteins. To validate subsets of those interactions, we
constructed an ORFeome library of vaccinia virus strain WR using the Gateway
plasmid cloning system. By co-expressing selected vaccinia and host proteins in a
variety of expression systems, we found that at least 17 of the Y2H hits
identified between vaccinia and human proteins can be verified by independent
methods using GST pull-down assays, representing a 63% validation rate for the
Y2H hits examined (17/27). Because the cloned ORFs are conveniently transferable 
from the entry vectors to various destination expression vectors, the vaccinia
ORFeome library will be a useful resource for future high-throughput functional
proteomic experiments.
