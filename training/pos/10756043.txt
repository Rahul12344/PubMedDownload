Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a common factor in human myocarditis. Apoptotic
events are present in CVB3-induced disease, but it is unclear how CVB3 is
involved in apoptosis and which viral proteins may induce the apoptotic pathway. 
In this report we demonstrate that the human and murine proapoptotic protein Siva
specifically interact with the CVB3 capsid protein VP2. Furthermore, the
transcription of Siva is strongly induced in tissue of CVB3-infected mice and is 
present in the same area which is positively stained for apoptosis, CD27, and
CD70. It has been proposed that Siva is involved in the CD27/CD70-transduced
apoptosis. Therefore, we suggest a molecular mechanism through which apoptotic
events contributes to CVB3-caused pathogenesis.
