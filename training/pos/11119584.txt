We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a cDNA library prepared from
normal human epidermal keratinocytes and identified protein partners for human
papilloma virus (HPV) E6 proteins. A clone that encoded Gps2 interacted with E6
proteins from HPVs of high and low oncogenic risk. The specificity of these
reactions was verified and the regions of E6 that were required for interaction
were mapped. Steady-state and pulse-chase analyses of cells cotransfected with
DNAs expressing E6 from either HPV6 or HPV18 and Gps2 demonstrated that the E6
proteins induced the degradation of Gps2 in vivo but not in vitro. Gps2 exhibited
transcriptional activation activity, and high-risk E6 suppressed this activity.
