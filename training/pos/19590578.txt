Detection of viral nucleic acids is central to antiviral immunity. Recently,
DAI/ZBP1 (DNA-dependent activator of IRFs/Z-DNA binding protein 1) was identified
as a cytoplasmic DNA sensor and shown to activate the interferon regulatory
factor (IRF) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) transcription factors,
leading to type-I interferon production. DAI-induced IRF activation depends on
TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), whereas signalling pathways and molecular
components involved in NF-kappaB activation remain elusive. Here, we report the
identification of two receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homotypic interaction
motifs (RHIMs) in the DAI protein sequence, and show that these domains relay
DAI-induced NF-kappaB signals through the recruitment of the RHIM-containing
kinases RIP1 and RIP3. We show that knockdown of not only RIP1, but also RIP3
affects DAI-induced NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, RIP recruitment to DAI is 
inhibited by the RHIM-containing murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) protein M45. These
findings delineate the DAI signalling pathway to NF-kappaB and suggest a possible
new immune modulation strategy of the MCMV.
