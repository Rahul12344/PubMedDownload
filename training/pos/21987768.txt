The Ebola virus (EBOV) protein VP24 inhibits type I and II interferon (IFN)
signaling by binding to NPI-1 subfamily karyopherin α (KPNA) nuclear import
proteins, preventing their interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1
(phospho-STAT1). This inhibits phospho-STAT1 nuclear import. A biochemical screen
now identifies heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein complex C1/C2 (hnRNP
C1/C2) nuclear import as an additional target of VP24. Co-immunoprecipitation
studies demonstrate that hnRNP C1/C2 interacts with multiple KPNA family members,
including KPNA1. Interaction with hnRNP C1/C2 occurs through the same KPNA1
C-terminal region (amino acids 424-457) that binds VP24 and phospho-STAT1. The
ability of hnRNP C1/C2 to bind KPNA1 is diminished in the presence of VP24, and
cells transiently expressing VP24 redistribute hnRNP C1/C2 from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm. These data further define the mechanism of hnRNP C1/C2 nuclear
import and demonstrate that the impact of EBOV VP24 on nuclear import extends
beyond STAT1.
