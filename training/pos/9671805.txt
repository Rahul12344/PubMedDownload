A northwestern screen of a CHO-K1 cell line cDNA library with radiolabelled HIV-1
TAR RNA identified a novel TAR RNA interacting protein, TRIP. The human trip cDNA
was also cloned and its expression is induced by phorbol esters. The N-terminus
of TRIP shows high homology to the coiled coil domain of FLAP, a protein which
binds the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) of Flightless I (FLI) and the interaction of 
TRIP with the FLI LRR has been confirmed in vitro . TRIP does not bind single
stranded DNA or RNA significantly and binds double stranded DNA weakly. In
contrast, TRIP binds double stranded RNA with high affinity and two molecules of 
TRIP bind the TAR stem. The RNA binding domain has been identified and
encompasses a lysine-rich motif. A TRIP-GFP fusion is localised in the cytoplasm 
and excluded from the nucleus. FLI has a C-terminal gelsolin-like domain which
binds actin and therefore the association of TRIP with the FLI LRR may provide a 
link between the actin cytoskeleton and RNA in mammalian cells.
