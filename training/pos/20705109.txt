Antimicrobial peptides have activity against a wide variety of biological
membranes and are an important component of innate immunity in vertebrate as well
as invertebrate systems. The mechanisms of action of these peptides are
incompletely understood and a number of competing but not necessarily mutually
exclusive models exist. In this study we examined the virucidal activity of four 
peptides, the human cathelicidin derived LL37, Xenopus alanine-substituted
Magainin-2 amide, uperin-3.1, and a cecropin-LL37 hybrid against vaccinia virus. 
The peptides were shown to be differentially virucidal but all were shown to
attack the viral envelope, with LL37 being the most effective and uperin-3.1 the 
least. Density gradient analysis of the treated virions indicated the virus outer
membrane was efficiently removed by peptide action and suggests a mechanism of
direct virus inactivation that is consistent with the carpet model for
peptide-mediated membrane disruption. Interestingly, the least effective peptide 
uperin-3.1 was equally effective as the others at inducing susceptibility to
neutralizing antibody. This suggests that in addition to direct killing by a
carpet-based mechanism, the peptides may simultaneously operate a different
mechanism that exposes sequestered antigen without membrane removal.
