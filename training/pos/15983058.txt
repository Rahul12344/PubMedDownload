E4orf6 plays an important role in the transportation of cellular and viral mRNAs 
and is known as an oncogene product of adenovirus. Here, we show that E4orf6
interacts with pp32/leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP). E4orf6 exports
pp32/LANP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with its binding partner, HuR, which 
binds to an AU-rich element (ARE) present within many protooncogene and cytokine 
mRNAs. We found that ARE-mRNAs, such as c-fos, c-myc, and cyclooxygenase-2, were 
also exported to and stabilized in the cytoplasm of E4orf6-expressing cells. The 
oncodomain of E4orf6 was necessary for both binding to pp32/LANP and effect for
ARE-mRNA. C-fos mRNA was exported together with E4orf6, E1B-55kD, pp32/LANP, and 
HuR proteins. Moreover, inhibition of the CRM1-dependent export pathway failed to
block the export of ARE-mRNAs mediated by E4orf6. Thus, E4orf6 interacts with
pp32/LANP to modulate the fate of ARE-mRNAs by altering the CRM1-dependent export
pathway.
