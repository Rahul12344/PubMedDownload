Studies published elsewhere have shown that the herpes simplex virus regulatory
protein ICP0 interacts with BMAL1, a partner and regulator of circadian histone
acetyltransferase CLOCK, that both proteins localize at ND10 bodies and are
stabilized by viral proteins, that enzymatically active CLOCK partially
complements Î”ICP0 mutants, and that silencing of CLOCK suppresses the expression 
of viral genes. Here we report that CLOCK is a component of the transcriptional
complex that includes TFIID, ICP4, ICP27, and ICP22. The results suggest that the
CLOCK histone acetyltransferase is a component of the viral transcriptional
machinery throughout the replicative cycle of the virus and that ICP27 and ICP22 
initiate their involvement in viral gene expression as components of viral
transcriptome.
