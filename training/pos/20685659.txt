Serine- and arginine-rich proteins 55 and 75 (SRp55 and SRp75) induce production 
of HIV-1 vpr mRNA by inhibiting the 5'-splice site of exon 3.

HIV-1 non-coding exon 3 can either be spliced to exons 4, 4a, 4b, 4c, and 5 to
generate tat, rev, and nef mRNAs or remain unspliced to produce the 13a7 vpr
mRNA. Here we show that serine- and arginine-rich proteins 55 and 75 (SRp55 and
SRp75) inhibit splicing from the 5'-splice site of exon 3 thereby causing an
accumulation of the partially unspliced 13a7 vpr mRNA. In contrast, serine- and
arginine-rich protein 40 (SRp40) induces splicing from exon 3 to exon 4, thereby 
promoting the production of the 1347 tat mRNA. We demonstrate that SRp55
stimulates vpr mRNA production by interacting with the previously identified
HIV-1 splicing enhancer named GAR and inhibiting its function. This inhibition
requires both serine arginine-rich and RNA-binding domains of SRp55, indicating
that production of HIV-1 vpr mRNA depends on the interaction of SRp55 with an
unknown factor.
