Ebola virus (EBOV) protein L (EBOL) acts as a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
To better understand the mechanisms underlying the transcription and replication 
of the EBOV genome, we sought to identify cellular factors involved in these
processes via their coimmunoprecipitation with EBOL and by mass spectrometry. Of 
65 candidate proteins identified, we focused on DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1), which
localizes to the nucleus and unwinds helical DNA. We found that in the presence
of EBOL, TOP1 colocalizes and interacts with EBOL in the cytoplasm, where
transcription and replication of the EBOV genome occur. Knockdown of TOP1
markedly reduced virus replication and viral polymerase activity. We also found
that the phosphodiester bridge-cleaving and recombination activities of TOP1 are 
required for the polymerase activity of EBOL. These results demonstrate that TOP1
is an important cellular factor for the transcription and replication of the EBOV
genome and, as such, plays a key role in the EBOV life cycle.
