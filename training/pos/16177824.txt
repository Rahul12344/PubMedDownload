The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA-LP protein is important for EBV-mediated B-cell
immortalization and is a potent gene-specific coactivator of the viral
transcriptional activator, EBNA2. The mechanism(s) by which EBNA-LP functions as 
a coactivator remains an important question in the biology of EBV-induced B-cell 
immortalization. In this study, we found that EBNA-LP interacts with the
promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (PML NB)-associated protein Sp100 and
displaces Sp100 and heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) from PML NBs.
Interaction between EBNA-LP and Sp100 was mediated through conserved region 3 in 
EBNA-LP and the PML NB targeting domain in Sp100. Overexpression of Sp100 lacking
the N-terminal PML NB targeting domain, but not a mutant form of Sp100 lacking
the HP1alpha interaction domain, was sufficient to coactivate EBNA2 in a
gene-specific manner independent of EBNA-LP. These findings suggest that Sp100 is
a major mediator of EBNA-LP coactivation. These studies indicate that modulation 
of PML NB-associated proteins may be important for establishment of latent viral 
infections, and also identify a convenient model system to investigate the
functions of Sp100.
