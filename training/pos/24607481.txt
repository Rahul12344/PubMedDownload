In this study, we demonstrate that the 7SK small nuclear ribonucleoprotein
(snRNP) complex is recruited to the HIV-1 promoter via newly-synthesized HIV-1
nascent transcripts (short transcripts) in an hnRNP A1-dependent manner and
negatively regulates viral transcript elongation. Our deep-sequence analysis
showed these short transcripts were mainly arrested at approximately +50 to +70
nucleotides from the transcriptional start site in the U1 cells, an HIV-1 latent 
model. TNF-α treatment promptly disrupted the 7SK snRNP complex on the nascent
transcripts and viral elongated transcripts were increased. This report provides 
insight into how 7SK snRNP complex is recruited to HIV-1 promoter in the absence 
of Tat.
