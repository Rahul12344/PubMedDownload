BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects resting B-lymphocytes and transforms
them into immortal proliferating lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) in vitro. The
transformed immunoblasts may grow up as immunoblastic lymphomas in
immuno-suppressed hosts.
RESULTS: In order to identify cellular protein targets that may be involved in
Epstein-Barr virus mediated B-cell transformation, human LCL cDNA library was
screened with one of the transformation associated nuclear antigens, EBNA-3 (also
called EBNA-3A), using the yeast two-hybrid system. A clone encoding a fragment
of a novel human protein was isolated (clone 538). The interaction was confirmed 
using in vitro binding assays. A full-length cDNA clone (F538) was isolated.
Sequence alignment with known proteins and 3D structure predictions suggest that 
F538 is a novel human uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase. The
GFP-F538 fluorescent fusion protein showed a preferentially cytoplasmic
distribution but translocated to the nucleus upon co-expression of EBNA-3. A
naturally occurring splice variant of F538, that lacks the C-terminal uracil
phosphoribosyltransferase part but maintain uridine kinase domain, did not
translocate to the nucleus in the presence of EBNA3. Antibody that was raised
against the bacterially produced GST-538 protein showed cytoplasmic staining in
EBV negative Burkitt lymphomas but gave a predominantly nuclear staining in EBV
positive LCL-s and stable transfected cells expressing EBNA-3.
CONCLUSION: We suggest that EBNA-3 by direct protein-protein interaction induces 
the nuclear accumulation of a novel enzyme, that is part of the ribonucleotide
salvage pathway. Increased intranuclear levels of UK/UPRT may contribute to the
metabolic build-up that is needed for blast transformation and rapid
proliferation.
