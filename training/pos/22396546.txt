The influenza virus neuraminidase (NA) protein primarily aids in the release of
progeny virions from infected cells. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for NA in 
enhancing host cell survival by activating the Src/Akt signaling axis via an
interaction with carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule
6/cluster of differentiation 66c (C6). NA/C6 interaction leads to increased
tyrosyl phosphorylation of Src, FAK, Akt, GSK3Î², and Bcl-2, which affects cell
survival, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis.
siRNA-mediated suppression of C6 resulted in a down-regulation of activated Src, 
FAK, and Akt, increased apoptosis, and reduced expression of viral proteins and
viral titers in influenza virus-infected human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial and
normal human bronchial epithelial cells. These findings indicate that influenza
NA not only aids in the release of progeny virions, but also cell survival during
viral replication.
