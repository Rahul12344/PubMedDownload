BACKGROUND: The replication and transcription activator (RTA) of Kaposi's
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a molecular switch that initiates a
productive replication of latent KSHV genomes. KSHV RTA (K-RTA) is composed of
691 amino acids with high Ser and Thr content (17.7%), but to what extent these
Ser and Thr are modified in vivo has not been explored.
METHODS: By using tandem mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified FLAG
tagged K-RTA, we sought to identify Ser and Thr residues that are
post-translationally modified in K-RTA.
RESULTS: We found that K-RTA is an O-GlcNAcylated protein and Thr-366/Thr-367 is 
the primary motif with O-GlcNAcylation in vivo. The biological significance of
O-GlcNAc modified Thr-366 and Thr-367 was assessed by site-specific amino acid
substitution. Replacement of Thr with Ala at amino acid 366 or 367 caused a
modest enhancement of K-RTA transactivation activity in a luciferase reporter
assay and a cell model for KSHV reactivation. By using co-immunoprecipitation
coupled with western blot analysis, we showed that the capacity of K-RTA in
associating with endogenous PARP1 was significantly reduced in the
Thr-366/Thr-367 O-GlcNAc mutants. PARP1 is a documented negative regulator of
K-RTA that can be ascribed by the attachment of large negatively charged polymer 
onto K-RTA via PARP1's poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. In agreement,
shRNA-mediated depletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in KSHV infected cells
augmented viral reactivation and virus production that was accompanied by
diminished K-RTA and PARP1 complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: KSHV latent-lytic switch K-RTA is modified by cellular
O-GlcNAcylation, which imposes a negative effect on K-RTA transactivation
activity. This inhibitory effect involves OGT and PARP1, two nutritional sensors 
recently emerging as chromatin modifiers. Thus, we speculate that the activity of
K-RTA on its target genes is continuously checked and modulated by OGT and PARP1 
in response to cellular metabolic state.
