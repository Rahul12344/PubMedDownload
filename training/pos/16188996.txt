Recognition of pathogens by the innate immune system is mediated by pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize specific molecular structures of
the infectious agents and subsequently trigger expression of genes involved in
host defense. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) represent a well-characterized class of 
membrane-bound PRRs, and the RNA helicase retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) 
has recently been described as a novel cytoplasmic PRR recognizing
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Here we show that activation of signal transduction 
and induction of cytokine expression by the paramyxovirus Sendai virus is
dependent on virus replication and involves PRRs in a cell-type-dependent manner.
While nonimmune cells relied entirely on recognition of dsRNA through RIG-I for
activation of an antiviral response, myeloid cells utilized both the
single-stranded RNA sensing TLR7 and TLR8 and dsRNA-dependent mechanisms
independent of RIG-I, TLR3, and dsRNA-activated protein kinase R to trigger this 
response. Therefore, there appears to be a large degree of cell-type specificity 
in the mechanisms used by the host to recognize infecting viruses.
