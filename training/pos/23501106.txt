Human phospholipid scramblase 1 (PLSCR1) is an interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene
and possesses an IFN-mediated antiviral function. We show here that PLSCR1
directly interacts with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Tat. This
interaction occurs both in vitro and in vivo through amino acids 160-250 of
PLSCR1. Overexpression of PLSCR1 efficiently represses the Tat-dependent
transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and reduces the nuclear
translocation of Tat. In addition, shRNA-mediated suppression of endogenous
PLSCR1 expression enhances the levels of gag mRNA in an HIV-1-infected T-cell
line. These findings indicate that PLSCR1 negatively regulates the Tat-dependent 
transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR during HIV-1 infection.
