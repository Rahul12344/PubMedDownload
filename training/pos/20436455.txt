Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) expresses numerous intronless
mRNAs that are unable to access splicing-dependent cellular mRNA nuclear export
pathways. To circumvent this problem, KSHV encodes the open reading frame 57
(ORF57) protein, which orchestrates the formation of an export-competent virus
ribonucleoprotein particle comprising the nuclear export complex hTREX, but not
the exon-junction complex (EJC). Interestingly, EJCs stimulate mRNA translation, 
which raises the intriguing question of how intronless KSHV transcripts are
efficiently translated. Herein, we show that ORF57 associates with components of 
the 48S pre-initiation complex and co-sediments with the 40S ribosomal subunits. 
Strikingly, we observed a direct interaction between ORF57 and PYM, a cellular
protein that enhances translation by recruiting the 48S pre-initiation complex to
newly exported mRNAs, through an interaction with the EJC. Moreover, detailed
biochemical analysis suggests that ORF57 recruits PYM to intronless KSHV mRNA and
PYM then facilitates the association of ORF57 and the cellular translation
machinery. We, therefore, propose a model whereby ORF57 interacts directly with
PYM to enhance translation of intronless KSHV transcripts.
