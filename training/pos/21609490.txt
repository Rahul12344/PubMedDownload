Herpes simplex virus induces the marked up-regulation of the zinc finger
transcriptional factor INSM1, which modulates the expression and localization of 
the immediate early protein ICP0.

BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) rapidly shut off macromolecular
synthesis in host cells. In contrast, global microarray analyses have shown that 
HSV infection markedly up-regulates a number of host cell genes that may play
important roles in HSV-host cell interactions. To understand the regulatory
mechanisms involved, we initiated studies focusing on the zinc finger
transcription factor insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1), a host cell protein
markedly up-regulated by HSV infection.
RESULTS: INSM1 gene expression in HSV-1-infected normal human epidermal
keratinocytes increased at least 400-fold 9 h after infection; INSM1 promoter
activity was also markedly stimulated. Expression and subcellular localization of
the immediate early HSV protein ICP0 was affected by INSM1 expression, and
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed binding of INSM1 to the ICP0
promoter. Moreover, the role of INSM1 in HSV-1 infection was further clarified by
inhibition of HSV-1 replication by INSM1-specific siRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that INSM1 up-regulation plays a positive role
in HSV-1 replication, probably by binding to the ICP0 promoter.
