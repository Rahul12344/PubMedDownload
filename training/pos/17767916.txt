Influenza A virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is the most important viral
regulatory factor that controls cellular processes to facilitate viral
replication. To gain further insight into the role of NS1, we tried to find novel
cellular factors that interact with NS1. The complexes of NS1 and target proteins
were pulled down from an infected cell lysate using anti-NS1 (A/Udorn/72)
single-chain Fv and identified by peptide mass fingerprinting analysis. We
identified nucleolin, a multifunctional major nucleolar protein, as a novel
NS1-binding protein. The RNA-binding domain of NS1 was responsible for this
binding, as judged by a GST (glutathione S-transferase) pull-down assay with the 
GST-fused functional domains of NS1. By laser confocal microscopy, we observed
the co-localization of NS1 with nucleolin most clearly in the nucleoli,
indicating that NS1 is interacting with nucleolin during infection. Our results
suggest a novel function of NS1, namely, affecting cellular events via
interaction with nucleolin.
