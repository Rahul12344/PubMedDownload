Translation initiation of the picornavirus genome is regulated by an internal
ribosome entry site (IRES). The IRES of a neurovirulent picornavirus, the GDVII
strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, requires polypyrimidine
tract-binding protein (PTB) for its function. Although neural cells are deficient
in PTB, they express a neural-specific homologue of PTB (nPTB). We now show that 
nPTB and PTB bind similarly to multiple sites in the GDVII IRES, rendering it
competent for efficient translation initiation. Mutation of a PTB or nPTB site
results in a more prominent decrease in nPTB than PTB binding, a decrease in
activity of nPTB compared with PTB in promoting translation initiation, and
attenuation of the neurovirulence of the virus without a marked effect on virus
growth in non-neural cells. The addition of a second-site mutation in the mutant 
IRES generates a new PTB (nPTB) binding site, and restores nPTB binding,
translation initiation and neurovirulence. We conclude that the tissue-specific
expression and differential RNA-binding properties of PTB and nPTB are important 
determinants of cell-specific translational control and viral neurovirulence.
