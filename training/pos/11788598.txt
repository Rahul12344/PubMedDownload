Hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene expression is mainly regulated at the transcription 
initiation level. The viral X protein (pX) is a transcription
coactivator/mediator targeting TFIIB for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II.
Here we report a novel pX nuclear target designated HBXAP (hepatitis B virus
X-associated protein). HBXAP is a novel cellular nuclear protein containing a PHD
(plant homology domain) finger, a domain shared by many proteins that play roles 
in chromatin remodeling, transcription coactivation, and oncogenesis. pX
physically interacts with HBXAP in vitro and in vivo via the HBXAP region
containing the PHD finger. At the functional level HBXAP increases HBV
transcription in a pX-dependent manner suggesting a role for this interaction in 
the virus life cycle. Interestingly, HBXAP collaborates with pX in coactivating
the transcriptional activator NF-kappaB. Coactivation of NF-kappaB was also
observed in tumor necrosis factor alpha-treated cells suggesting that pX-HBXAP
functional collaboration localized downstream to the NF-kappaB nuclear import.
Collectively our data suggest that pX recruits and potentiates a novel putative
transcription coactivator to regulate NF-kappaB. The implication of pX-HBXAP
interaction in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma is discussed.
