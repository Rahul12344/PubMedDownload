The varicella-zoster virus major transactivator, IE62, contains a potent
N-terminal acidic transcriptional activation domain (TAD). Our experiments
revealed that the minimal IE62 TAD encompasses amino acids (aa) 19 to 67. We
showed that the minimal TAD interacts with the human Mediator complex.
Site-specific mutations revealed residues throughout the minimal TAD that are
important for both activation and Mediator interaction. The TAD interacts
directly with aa 402 to 590 of the MED25 subunit, and site-specific TAD mutations
abolished this interaction. Two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy revealed that the TAD is intrinsically unstructured. Our studies
suggest that transactivation may involve the TAD adopting a defined structure
upon binding MED25.
