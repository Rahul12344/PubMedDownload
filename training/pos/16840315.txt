The varicella-zoster virus major transactivator, IE62, can activate expression
from homologous and heterologous promoters. High levels of IE62-mediated
activation appear to involve synergy with cellular transcription factors. The
work presented here focuses on functional interactions of IE62 with the
ubiquitously expressed cellular factor USF. We have found that USF can synergize 
with IE62 to a similar extent on model minimal promoters and the complex native
ORF28/29 regulatory element, neither of which contains a consensus IE62 binding
site. Using Gal4 fusion constructs, we have found that the activation domain of
USF1 is necessary and sufficient for synergistic activation with IE62. We have
mapped the regions of USF and IE62 required for direct physical interaction.
Deletion of the required region within IE62 does not ablate synergistic
activation but does influence its efficiency depending on promoter architecture. 
Both proteins stabilize/increase binding of TATA binding protein/TFIID to
promoter elements. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the observed
synergistic activation which requires neither site-specific IE62 binding to the
promoter nor a direct physical interaction with USF.
