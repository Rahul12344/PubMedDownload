Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been shown to exhibit several biological
properties which suggest an important role in liver pathogenesis and
carcinogenesis. During a previous study, we showed that core mutants, isolated
from tumour, could directly interact with PKR and maintain it in an activated
form. In the present report, we have further investigated this interaction and
mapped the core and PKR domains involved. Using glutathion S-transferase fusion
protein harbouring the different domains of core or PKR, we determined that the
N-terminal 1-58 amino acid (aa) of core protein and the N-terminal 1-180 aa of
PKR are responsible for this direct interaction. Using this system we also
confirmed that the core-PKR interaction induced PKR autophosphorylation.
Furthermore, we found that core protein co-localized and co-immunoprecipitated
with PKR in cells expressing a full-length HCV replicon, thus confirming that
this interaction occurs when all HCV proteins are expressed. Considering that the
activation of PKR has been observed in some cancer cell lines and tissues, it
suggests that, depending on the cellular context, PKR may stimulate or inhibit
cell proliferation. The precise mapping of core-PKR interaction provides new data
to study the molecular mechanism underlying HCV pathogenesis.
