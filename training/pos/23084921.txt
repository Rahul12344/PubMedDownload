Dengue viruses (DVs) are responsible for the most medically relevant arboviral
diseases. However, the molecular interactions mediating DV entry are poorly
understood. We determined that TIM and TAM proteins, two receptor families that
mediate the phosphatidylserine (PtdSer)-dependent phagocytic removal of apoptotic
cells, serve as DV entry factors. Cells poorly susceptible to DV are robustly
infected after ectopic expression of TIM or TAM receptors. Conversely, DV
infection of susceptible cells is inhibited by anti-TIM or anti-TAM antibodies or
knockdown of TIM and TAM expression. TIM receptors facilitate DV entry by
directly interacting with virion-associated PtdSer. TAM-mediated infection relies
on indirect DV recognition, in which the TAM ligand Gas6 acts as a bridging
molecule by binding to PtdSer within the virion. This dual mode of virus
recognition by TIM and TAM receptors reveals how DVs usurp the apoptotic cell
clearance pathway for infectious entry.
