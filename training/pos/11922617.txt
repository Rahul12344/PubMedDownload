Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein has been shown to have RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) activity by itself and is a key enzyme involved in viral
replication. Using analyses with the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding
assay, we found that human eukaryotic initiation factor 4AII (heIF4AII), which is
a component of the eIF4F complex and RNA-dependent ATPase/helicase, interacted
with NS5B protein. These two proteins were shown to be partially colocalized in
the perinuclear region. The binding site in HCV NS5B protein was localized within
amino acid residues 495 to 537 near the C terminus. Since eIF4A has a helicase
activity and functions in a bidirectional manner, the binding of HCV NS5B protein
to heIF4AII raises the possibility that heIF4AII facilitates the genomic RNA
synthesis of NS5B protein by unwinding the secondary structure of the HCV genome 
and is a host component of viral replication complex.
