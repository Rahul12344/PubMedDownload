PROBLEM: CCL20/MIP3alpha is a chemokine for immature dendritic cells as well as
an antibacterial against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The role of
CCL20/MIP3alpha as an antiviral is unknown. In this study, we have examined the
production of CCL20/MIP3alpha by epithelial cells from the upper female
reproductive tract as well as its activity as an antiviral molecule.
METHOD OF STUDY: Primary uterine and Fallopian tube epithelial cells were treated
with Poly(I:C) and CCL20/MIP3alpha mRNA and protein was measured by Realtime
RT-PCR and ELISA assays. Anti-HIV activity was determined using an indicator cell
line TZM-bl and quantified by using a luminometer.
RESULTS: Primary uterine and Fallopian tube epithelial cells produce
CCL20/MIP3alpha constitutively and the production is enhanced following
stimulation with viral double-stranded RNA mimic Poly(I:C). Recombinant
CCL20/MIP3alpha was able to inhibit both T-cell-tropic X4/IIIB and
macrophage-tropic R5/BaL HIV-1 when virus was directly incubated with
CCL20/MIP3alpha but not when CCL20/MIP3alpha was added to cells either prior to
infection or post-infection. This suggests that the mechanism of inhibition is
likely to be a direct interaction between HIV-1 and CCL20/MIP3alpha.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CCL20/MIP3alpha is an important
endogenous anti-HIV-1 microbicide of the female reproductive tract.
