Human IL-10 (hIL-10) modulates critical immune and inflammatory responses by way 
of interactions with its high- (IL-10R1) and low-affinity (IL-10R2) cell surface 
receptors. Human cytomegalovirus exploits the IL-10 signaling pathway by
expressing a functional viral IL-10 homolog (cmvIL-10), which shares only 27%
sequence identity with hIL-10 yet signals through IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. To define 
the molecular basis of this virus-host interaction, we determined the 2.7-A
crystal structure of cmvIL-10 bound to the extracellular fragment of IL-10R1
(sIL-10R1). The structure reveals cmvIL-10 forms a disulfide-linked homodimer
that binds two sIL-10R1 molecules. Although cmvIL-10 and hIL-10 share similar
intertwined topologies and sIL-10R1 binding sites, their respective interdomain
angles differ by approximately 40 degrees. This difference results in a striking 
re-organization of the IL-10R1s in the putative cell surface complex. Solution
binding studies show cmvIL-10 and hIL-10 share essentially identical affinities
for sIL-10R1 whereas the Epstein-Barr virus IL-10 homolog (ebvIL-10), whose
structure is highly similar to hIL-10, exhibits a approximately 20-fold reduction
in sIL-10R1 affinity. Our results suggest cmvIL-10 and ebvIL-10 have evolved
different molecular mechanisms to engage the IL-10 receptors that ultimately
enhance the respective ability of their virus to escape immune detection.
