Adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV)-based vectors have gained attention as a
potentially useful alternative to the more commonly used retroviral and
adenoviral vectors for human gene therapy. Although AAV uses the ubiquitously
expressed cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as a receptor, the
transduction efficiency of AAV vectors varies greatly in different cells and
tissues in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate here that cell surface expression of
HSPG alone is insufficient for AAV infection, and that AAV also requires human
fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a co-receptor for successful viral
entry into the host cell. We document that cells that do not express either HSPG 
or FGFR1 fail to bind AAV and, consequently, are resistant to infection by AAV.
These non-permissive cells are successfully transduced by AAV vectors after
stable transfections with cDNAs encoding the murine HSPG and the human FGFR1.
Furthermore, AAV infection of permissive cells, known to express both FGFR1 and
the epidermal growth factor receptor, is abrogated by treatment of cells with
basic fibroblast growth factor, but not with epidermal growth factor. The
identification of FGFR1 as a co-receptor for AAV should provide new insights not 
only into its role in the life cycle of AAV, but also in the optimal use of AAV
vectors in human gene therapy.
