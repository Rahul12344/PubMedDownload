The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been linked to Kaposi
sarcoma, body cavity-based lymphoma, and Castleman disease. vIRF-3 is a KSHV
latent gene that is critical for proliferation of KSHV-positive lymphoid cells.
Furthermore, vIRF-3 contributes to KSHV-associated pathogenesis by stimulating
c-Myc transcription activity. Here we show that vIRF-3 can associate with Skp2, a
key component of the SCF(skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex. Skp2 is a
transcriptional co-factor for c-Myc that was shown to regulate the stability of
c-Myc protein as well as c-Myc-dependent transcription. In this study, we show
that vIRF-3 binds to the F-box of Skp2 and recruits it to c-Myc-regulated
promoters to activate c-Myc-dependent transcription. Additionally, cells
overexpressing vIRF-3 exhibit higher levels of c-Myc ubiquitylation, suggesting
that ubiquitylation is necessary for c-Myc-mediated transcription. Moreover,
vIRF-3 can stabilize the c-Myc protein by increasing its half-life. Collectively,
these results indicate that vIRF-3 can effectively manipulate c-Myc stability and
function and thus contribute to c-Myc-induced KSHV-associated lymphomagenesis.
