By dissecting and reconstituting a cell-free influenza virus genome replication
system, we have purified and identified the minichromosome maintenance (MCM)
complex, which is thought to be a DNA replicative helicase, as one of the host
factors that regulate the virus genome replication. MCM interacted with the PA
subunit of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is found to be involved in
the replication genetically. The virus genome replication was decreased in MCM2
knockdown cells. The viral polymerase appeared to be a nonproductive complex,
that is, it was capable of initiating replication but produced only abortive
short RNA chains. MCM stimulated de novo-initiated replication reaction by
stabilizing a replication complex during its transition from initiation to
elongation. Based on the findings, including the result that the MCM-mediated RNA
replication reaction was competed with exogenously added RNA, we propose that MCM
functions as a scaffold between the nascent RNA chains and the viral polymerase.
