promoter activity by the competition for the activating protein 1 binding site
and the formation of the ATF2-Jun heterodimer.

The hepatitis B viral X promoter is known to be positively autoregulated by its
own HBx protein, which also interacts with many cellular regulatory proteins. We 
investigated the effect of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) on the
activity of the X promoter. Cotransfection of the ATF2 expression vector with a X
promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid repressed the X promoter
activity in HepG2 cells. HBx activated activating protein 1 (AP-1)-mediated
transcription through the hepatitis B virus E element by 35-fold, while its
activation activity was inhibited in the presence of ATF2, suggesting that ATF2
inhibited the autoactivation of X promoter by HBx and basal transcription
mediated by AP-1. Since the binding sites of AP-1 and ATF2 in the hepatitis B
virus E element overlap, the repression of X promoter activity by ATF2 is exerted
by the competition for the AP-1 binding site and the formation of the ATF2-Jun
heterodimer as in the case of the consensus AP-1 element. However, the small X
promoter had a ATF2 binding site and was activated by ATF2. These results suggest
that the syntheses of X proteins are differentially regulated by ATF2.
