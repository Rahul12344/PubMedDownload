Interplay between the host and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a pivotal role in
the outcome of infection. A region (referred to as UL/b') present in the Toledo
strain of HCMV and low passage clinical isolates contains 19 additional genes,
which are absent in the highly passaged laboratory strain AD169. Products of the 
UL/b' genes may determine the manifestations of HCMV infection in vivo. However, 
little is known about the host factors, which interact with UL/b' proteins. This 
study was conducted to investigate the function of the HCMV UL136 protein. By
yeast two-hybrid screening, the Î²1 subunit of the host Na+/K+-ATPase (ATP1B1) was
identified to be a candidate protein, which interacts with the HCMV UL136
protein. The interaction was further evaluated both in vitro by pull-down assay
and in vivo by immunofluorescent co-localization. The results showed that the
UL136 protein can interact with ATP1B1 in vitro. Co-localization of UL136-EGFP
and ATP1B1-DsRed in cell membranes suggests that ATP1B1 was a partner of the
UL136 protein. It can be proposed that the HCMV UL136 protein may have important 
roles in processes such as cell-to-cell spread, and in maintaining cell osmotic
pressure and intracellular ion homeostasis during HCMV infection.
