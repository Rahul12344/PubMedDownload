Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a parvovirus with a small single-stranded DNA
genome that relies on cellular replication machinery together with functions
supplied by coinfecting helper viruses. The impact of host factors on AAV
infection is not well understood. We explored the connection between AAV helper
functions supplied by adenovirus and cellular DNA repair proteins. The adenoviral
E1b55K/E4orf6 proteins induce degradation of the cellular Mre11 repair complex
(MRN) to promote productive adenovirus infection. These viral proteins also
augment recombinant AAV transduction and provide crucial helper functions for
wild-type AAV replication. Here, we show that MRN poses a barrier to AAV and that
the helper function provided by E1b55K/E4orf6 involves MRN degradation. Using a
fluorescent method to visualize the viral genome, we show an effect at the viral 
DNA level. MRN components accumulate at AAV replication centers and recognize the
viral inverted terminal repeats. Together, our data suggest that AAV is targeted 
by MRN and has evolved to exploit adenoviral proteins that degrade these cellular
factors.
