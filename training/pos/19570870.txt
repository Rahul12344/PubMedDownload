Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome replicates within the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 
complex in the modified membranous structures extended from endoplasmic
reticulum. A proteomic analysis of HCV RNP complexes revealed the association of 
oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) as one of the components of these complexes.
OSBP interacted with the N-terminal domain I of the HCV NS5A protein and
colocalized to the Golgi compartment with NS5A. An OSBP-specific short hairpin
RNA that partially downregulated OSBP expression resulted in a decrease of the
HCV particle release in culture supernatant with little effect on viral RNA
replication. The pleckstrin homology (PH) domain located in the N-terminal region
of OSBP targeted this protein to the Golgi apparatus. OSBP deletion mutation in
the PH (DeltaPH) domain failed to localize to the Golgi apparatus and inhibited
the HCV particle release. These studies suggest a possible functional role of
OSBP in the HCV maturation process.
