Expression of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Nef protein has been linked 
to both decreased cell surface expression of CD4 and an impairment of signal
transduction. The recently reported association of Nef with an unidentified
serine kinase provides a clue as to how Nef might exert its effects. Considering 
the key role of protein kinase C (PKC) in T cell activation, we investigated the 
possibility that Nef interacts with PKC. Our results, using two approaches for
detecting interactions between Nef and PKC isozymes in Jurkat cells, show that
Nef interacts preferentially with thetaPKC. The interaction of Nef and thetaPKC
is independent of calcium, enhanced by phospholipid activators of PKC and not
affected by a PKC pseudosubstrate peptide. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and
phytohemagglutinin stimulation of Jurkat cells expressing Nef fails to produce
the usual translocation of thetaPKC from the cytosol to the particulate fraction;
translocation of betaPKC and epsilonPKC was unaffected. Indeed, there appears to 
be a net loss of thetaPKC in Nef-expressing cells following stimulation. The loss
of thetaPKC, which may be a result of inhibition of its binding to RACKs due to
Nef binding, could contribute to the various impairments of T cell function
associated with HIV infection and Nef expression.
