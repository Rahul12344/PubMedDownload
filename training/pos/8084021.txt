Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gene expression is regulated by an
enhancer region composed of multiple potential cis-acting regulatory sites. Here,
we describe binding sites for the transcription factor AP-2 in the HIV-1 long
terminal repeat which modulate HIV enhancer function. One site is embedded within
the two previously described kappa B elements, and a second site is detected
further downstream. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay
experiments demonstrated that AP-2 binds to the site between the kappa B
elements. Interestingly, AP-2 and NF-kappa B bind to this region in a mutually
exclusive manner. Mutations which disrupt this AP-2-binding site lower basal
levels of transcription but do not affect NF-kappa B-mediated induction by tumor 
necrosis factor alpha in Jurkat T leukemia cells.
