Synergism between transcriptional activators is a powerful way of potentiating
their function. Here we show that the glial POU domain protein Tst-1 (also known 
as Oct-6 and SCIP) and large tumor antigen (T antigen) synergistically increased 
transcription from both the early and the late promoters of papovavirus JC in
glial cells. Synergism between both proteins did not require T-antigen-mediated
DNA replication or direct binding of T antigen to the promoter. The ability of T 
antigen to functionally cooperate with Tst-1 was contained within its N-terminal 
region, shown by the fact that small tumor antigen (t antigen) could substitute
for T antigen in transfection experiments. In addition to this functional
synergism, a direct interaction between Tst-1 and T antigen was observed in
vitro. Using deletion mutants of Tst-1 and T antigen, the POU domain of Tst-1 and
the N-terminal region of T antigen were found to participate in this interaction.
Because of the low levels of Tst-1 present in oligodendrocytes, synergism between
Tst-1 and T antigen could be an important factor in establishing the lytic
infection of oligodendrocytes by JC virus during the course of the fatal
demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.
