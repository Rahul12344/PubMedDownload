Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the causative agent of adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL), whereas the closely related virus HTLV-2 has not been
associated with such malignant conditions. HTLV-1 Tax1 oncoprotein transforms a
rat fibroblast cell line (Rat-1) much more efficiently than does HTLV-2 Tax2. By 
using a differential display analysis, we isolated MAGI-3 as a Tax1-inducible
gene in Rat-1 cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
analysis confirmed that Tax1 induced MAGI-3 in Rat-1 cells. MAGI-3 has multiple
PDZ domains and interacted with Tax1 but not Tax2 in 293T cells. The interaction 
of Tax1 with MAGI-3 was dependent on a PDZ domain-binding motif, which is missing
in Tax2. The interaction of Tax1 with MAGI-3 altered their respective subcellular
localization, and moreover, the interaction correlated well with the high
transforming activities of Tax1 in Rat-1 cells relative to Tax2. MAGI-3 mRNA and 
the allied MAGI-1, but not MAGI-2, were expressed in HTLV-1-infected T-cell
lines. Our results suggest that the interaction of Tax1 and MAGI-3 alters their
respective biological activities, which may play a role in transformation by Tax1
as well as in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated diseases.
