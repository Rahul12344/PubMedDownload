Up to now, little is known about hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc)
interactions with host-cell proteins, although such interactions might be
essential for virus propagation and pathogenicity. In this work, a human liver
cDNA library was screened for proteins interacting with HBc. Among several
HBc-interacting partners selected, it interacted most strongly with the human
protein GIPC1. A common protein interaction domain, PDZ, was identified as the
region that is sufficient for the interaction with HBc. The core protein has a
putative C-terminal PDZ-interacting motif, and this sequence proved to be
important for the interaction with GIPC1.
