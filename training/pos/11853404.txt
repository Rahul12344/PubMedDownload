Repression of transcription by the full-length E2 protein of papillomaviruses
(PV) seems to occur when the E2 binding sites and those of positively acting
cellular factors overlap. Previously, we showed that RUNX1 (formerly called CBF) 
binds to the repression-mediating E2 binding site P2 of human PV type 8 (HPV8).
By a yeast one-hybrid system we could identify an unknown protein binding also to
P2, tentatively called PBF (papillomavirus binding factor). PBF recognizes the
sequence CCGG, which represents the 3' half of the E2 binding site just adjacent 
to the RUNX1 motif. PBF also binds to the repression-mediating E2 BS-1 in BPV1,
which is conserved to P2 of HPV8. Point mutations destroying PBF binding to HPV8 
P2 and BPV-1 E2 BS-1 in vitro reduce promoter activity in corresponding reporter 
constructs. Our results suggest that PBF might play a role in transcription of PV
genes and in E2-mediated repression.
