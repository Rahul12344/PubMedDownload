The ARFP/F protein is synthesized from the +1 reading frame of the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) core protein gene. The function of this protein remains unknown. To
study the function of the HCV ARFP/F protein, we have conducted the yeast
two-hybrid screening experiment to identify cellular proteins that may interact
with the ARFP/F protein. MM-1, a c-Myc interacting protein, was found to interact
with HCV ARFP/F protein in this experiment. The physical interaction between
ARFP/F and MM-1 proteins was further confirmed by the GST pull-down assay, the
co-immunoprecipitation assay and confocal microscopy. As MM-1 can inhibit the
gene transactivation activity of c-Myc, we have conducted further analysis to
examine the possible effect of the ARFP/F protein on c-Myc. Our results indicate 
that the HCV ARFP/F protein can enhance the gene trans-activation activity of
c-Myc, apparently by antagonizing the inhibitory effect of MM-1. The ability of
the ARFP/F protein to enhance the activity of c-Myc raises the possibility that
ARFP/F protein might play a role in hepatocellular transformation in HCV
patients.
