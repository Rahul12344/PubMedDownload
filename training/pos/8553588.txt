The E6 and E7 proteins of the high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) act
coordinately to immortalize human keratinocytes. These viral oncoproteins
function by binding and altering the activity of cellular proteins which regulate
cell cycle progression. Among the proteins bound by E7 are the retinoblastoma
protein, Rb, as well as the related p107 and p130 proteins. In addition, E7 binds
cyclin A, which regulates transit through the S and G2/M phases of the cell
cycle. In this study, we demonstrate that HPV 18 E7 also associates with cyclin E
which controls the G1/S transition. E7/cyclin E complexes were immunoprecipitated
from E7-expressing cells as well as from cell extracts using GST-E7 fusion
proteins. E7 was found to complex with a single form of cyclin E, and the binding
was mediated through p107. Both E7/cyclin E and E7/cyclin A complexes exhibit
kinase activity through associated cdk2 proteins which can contribute to
phosphorylation of p107. The association of E7 with proteins which regulate
transit through the cell cycle may provide an additional mechanism by which
infection with human papillomaviruses results in cellular hyperproliferation.
