Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication requires viral nonstructural proteins as 
well as cellular factors. Recently, a cellular protein, synaptotagmin-binding,
cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP), also known as NSAP1, was found to 
bind HCV RNA and enhance HCV IRES-dependent translation. We investigate whether
this protein is also involved in the HCV RNA replication. We found that SYNCRIP
was associated with detergent-resistant membrane fractions and colocalized with
newly-synthesized HCV RNA. Knock-down of SYNCRIP by siRNA significantly decreased
the amount of HCV RNA in the cells containing a subgenomic replicon or a
full-length viral RNA. Lastly, an in vitro replication assay after
immunodepletion of SYNCRIP showed that SYNCRIP was directly involved in HCV RNA
replication. These findings indicate that SYNCRIP has dual functions,
participating in both RNA replication and translation in HCV life cycle.
