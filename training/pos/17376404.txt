In addition to the human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced immortalization of
epithelial cells, which usually requires integration of the viral DNA into the
host cell genome, steroid hormone-activated nuclear receptors (NRs) are thought
to bind to specific DNA sequences within transcriptional regulatory regions on
the long control region to either increase or suppress transcription of dependent
genes. In this study, our data suggest that the NR coactivator function of HPV E2
proteins might be mediated through physical and functional interactions with not 
only NRs but also the NR coactivators GRIP1 (glucocorticoid receptor-interacting 
protein 1) and Zac1 (zinc-finger protein which regulates apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest 1), reciprocally regulating their transactivation activities. GRIP1 and
Zac1 both were able to act synergistically with HPV E2 proteins on the E2-,
androgen receptor-, and estrogen receptor-dependent transcriptional activation
systems. GRIP1 and Zac1 might selectively function with HPV E2 proteins on
thyroid receptor- and p53-dependent transcriptional activation, respectively.
Hence, the transcriptional function of E2 might be mediated through NRs and NR
coactivators to regulate E2-, NR-, and p53-dependent transcriptional activations.
