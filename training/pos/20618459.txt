AIM: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is highly correlated with hepatocellular
carcinoma. Previous studies have reported that expression of hepatitis B virus
pre-S2 mutant surface antigen is related to hepatoma development. An aberrant
carbohydrate metabolism is a hallmark of malignant transformation.
METHODS: We performed yeast two-hybrid screening with HBV pre-S2-del large
surface protein (pre-S2Delta) by using human liver cDNA library, and identified
the acid alpha-glucosidase (acid alpha-glucosidase) as the novel cellular
interacting protein of pre-S2Delta. The association of pre-S2Delta with the acid 
alpha-glucosidase was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence and
co-immunoprecipitation assay. Further, the acid alpha-glucosidase activity and
glycogen content were analyzed in ML-1 cells expressing pre-S2Delta.
RESULTS: The interaction between HBV large surface protein and acid
alpha-glucosidase was demonstrated with co-immunoprecipitation in vitro and in
vivo, and the binding was mediated through c-terminal region 889-952 amino acid
of acid alpha-glucosidase. On the other hand, HBV large surface protein
interacted with acid alpha-glucosidase through N-terminal region 1-157 amino acid
of HBV large surface protein. Expression of HBV large surface protein enhanced
acid alpha-glucosidase activity and resulted in decrease of cellular glycogen.
CONCLUSION: Our result demonstrates that HBV large surface protein interacts with
acid alpha-glucosidase which plays an important role in glycogen balance.
Together, these data suggest a novel pathway by which HBV large surface protein
affects carbohydrate metabolism.
