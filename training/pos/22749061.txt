Usage of the HIV-1 major 5' splice site D1 is a prerequisite for generation of
all spliced viral mRNAs encoding essential regulatory and structural proteins. We
set out to determine whether flanking sequences ensure D1-activation. We found
that an exonic splicing enhancer function is exerted by the region upstream of
D1, which is crucially required for its activation. Additionally, we identified
an intronic splicing regulatory element within the p17-instability element of the
Gag-ORF enhancing D1-activation. Furthermore, our experimental data demonstrated 
that sequence motifs displaying high similarity to consensus binding sites for SR
protein SC35 (SRSF2) overlapping with D1 fine-tune its activation. Our results
reveal that D1-activation is safe-guarded by the interplay of upstream and
downstream located splicing enhancer elements ensuring usage of D1 even if its
strength is decreased upon mutation. The identification of sequence elements
activating D1-usage sheds further light on the balanced expression of
alternatively spliced HIV-1 mRNAs.
