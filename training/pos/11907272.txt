FBI-1 can stimulate HIV-1 Tat activity and is targeted to a novel subnuclear
domain that includes the Tat-P-TEFb-containing nuclear speckles.

FBI-1 is a cellular POZ-domain-containing protein that binds to the HIV-1 LTR and
associates with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat. Here we show that elevated 
levels of FBI-1 specifically stimulate Tat activity and that this effect is
dependent on the same domain of FBI-1 that mediates Tat-FBI-1 association in
vivo. FBI-1 also partially colocalizes with Tat and Tat's cellular cofactor,
P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T1), at the splicing-factor-rich nuclear speckle domain. 
Further, a less-soluble population of FBI-1 distributes in a novel
peripheral-speckle pattern of localization as well as in other nuclear regions.
This distribution pattern is dependent on the FBI-1 DNA binding domain, on the
presence of cellular DNA, and on active transcription. Taken together, these
results suggest that FBI-1 is a cellular factor that preferentially associates
with active chromatin and that can specifically stimulate Tat-activated HIV-1
transcription.
