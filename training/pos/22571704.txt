BACKGROUND: Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an enveloped RNA virus, bearing
severe economic losses to the poultry industry worldwide. Previous virion
proteomic studies have shown that enveloped viruses carry multiple host cellular 
proteins both internally and externally during their life cycle. To address
whether it also occurred during NDV infection, we performed a comprehensive
proteomic analysis of highly purified NDV La Sota strain particles.
RESULTS: In addition to five viral structural proteins, we detected thirty
cellular proteins associated with purified NDV La Sota particles. The identified 
cellular proteins comprised several functional categories, including cytoskeleton
proteins, annexins, molecular chaperones, chromatin modifying proteins,
enzymes-binding proteins, calcium-binding proteins and signal
transduction-associated proteins. Among these, three host proteins have not been 
previously reported in virions of other virus families, including two signal
transduction-associated proteins (syntenin and Ras small GTPase) and one
tumor-associated protein (tumor protein D52). The presence of five selected
cellular proteins (i.e., Î²-actin, tubulin, annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp90
and ezrin) associated with the purified NDV particles was validated by Western
blot or immunogold labeling assays.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study presented the first standard proteomic profile of 
NDV. The results demonstrated the incorporation of cellular proteins in NDV
particles, which provides valuable information for elucidating viral infection
and pathogenesis.
