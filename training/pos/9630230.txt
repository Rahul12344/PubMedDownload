NF-kappaB, a key regulator of the cellular inflammatory and immune response, is
activated by the HTLV-I transforming and transactivating protein Tax. We show
that Tax binds to the amino terminus of the protein kinase MEKK1, a component of 
an IkappaB kinase complex, and stimulates MEKK1 kinase activity. Tax expression
increases the activity of IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) to enhance
phosphorylation of serine residues in IkappaB alpha that lead to its degradation.
Dominant negative mutants of both IKKbeta and MEKK1 prevent Tax activation of the
NF-kappaB pathway. Furthermore, recombinant MEKK1 stimulates IKKbeta
phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha. Thus, Tax-mediated increases in NF-kappaB
nuclear translocation result from direct interactions of Tax and MEKK1 leading to
enhanced IKKbeta phosphorylation of IkappaB alpha.
