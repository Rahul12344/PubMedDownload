Proteolytic cleavage of haemagglutinin (HA) is essential for the infectivity of
influenza A viruses (IAVs). This is usually mediated by trypsin-like proteases
present in the respiratory tract. However, the ability to use plasminogen (PLG)
as an alternative protease may contribute to pathogenesis of IAV infections and
virus replication outside the respiratory tract. It was demonstrated previously
that neuraminidase (NA) of the IAV strain A/WSN/33 can sequester PLG, allowing
this virus to replicate in a PLG-dependent fashion. However, PLG also promotes
replication of other IAVs, although its mode of action is poorly understood.
Here, using NA-deficient viruses, we demonstrate that NA is not required for the 
binding of PLG and subsequent cleavage of HA. However, we demonstrate that the
cellular protein annexin 2 (A2) can bind PLG and contributes to PLG-dependent
cleavage of HA and subsequent IAV replication. Collectively, these results
indicate that PLG promotes IAV replication in an A2-dependent fashion in the
absence of NA.
