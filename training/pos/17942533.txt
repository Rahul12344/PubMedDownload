Ubiquitination of the human T-cell leukemia virus 1 Tax oncoprotein provides an
important regulatory mechanism that promotes the Tax-mediated activation of
NF-kappaB. However, the type of polyubiquitin chain linkages and the host factors
that are required for Tax ubiquitination have not been identified. Here, we
demonstrate that Tax polyubiquitin chains are composed predominantly of lysine
63-linked chains. Furthermore, the ubiquitination of Tax is critically dependent 
on the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13. Tax interacts with Ubc13, and small
interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Ubc13 expression abrogates Tax
ubiquitination and the activation of NF-kappaB. Mouse fibroblasts lacking Ubc13
exhibit impaired Tax activation of NF-kappaB despite normal tumor necrosis
factor- and interleukin-1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Finally, the interaction
of Tax with NEMO is disrupted in the absence of Tax ubiquitination and Ubc13
expression, suggesting that Tax ubiquitination is critical for NEMO binding.
Collectively, our results reveal that Ubc13 is essential for Tax ubiquitination, 
its interaction with NEMO, and Tax-mediated NF-kappaB activation.
