Recentstudies have shown that wild-type and recombinant adeno-associated virus
(AAV and rAAV) genomes persist in human tissue predominantly as double-stranded
(ds) circular episomes derived from input linear single-stranded virion DNA.
Using self-complementary recombinant AAV (scAAV) vectors, we generated
intermediates that directly transition to ds circular episomes. The scAAV genome 
ends are palindromic hairpin-structured terminal repeats, resembling a
double-stranded break repair intermediate. Utilizing this substrate, we found
cellular DNA recombination and repair factors to be essential for generating
circular episomal products. To identify the specific cellular proteins involved, 
the scAAV circularization-dependent vector was used as a reporter in 19 mammalian
DNA repair-deficient cell lines. The results show that RecQ helicase family
members (BLM and WRN), Mre11 and NBS1 of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex, and 
ATM are required for efficient scAAV genome circularization. We further
demonstrated that the scAAV genome requires ATM and DNA-PK(CS), but not NBS1, to 
efficiently convert to a circular form in nondividing cells in vivo using
transgenic mice. These studies identify specific pathways involved for further
elucidating viral and cellular mechanisms of DNA maintenance important to the
viral life cycle and vector utilizations.
