The human immunodeficiency virus encodes the transcriptional transactivator Tat, 
which binds to the transactivation response (TAR) RNA stem-loop in the viral long
terminal repeat (LTR) and increases rates of elongation rather than initiation of
transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). In this study, we demonstrate that
Tat binds directly to the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7), which leads to
productive interactions between Tat and the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) complex
and between Tat and TFIIH. Tat activates the phosphorylation of the
carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II by CAK in vitro. The ability of CAK to
phosphorylate the CTD can be inhibited specifically by a CDK7 pseudosubstrate
peptide that also inhibits transcriptional activation by Tat in vitro and in
vivo. We conclude that the phosphorylation of the CTD by CAK is essential for Tat
transactivation. Our data identify a cellular protein that interacts with the
activation domain of Tat, demonstrate that this interaction is critical for the
function of Tat, and provide a mechanism by which Tat increases the processivity 
of Pol II.
