The phosphorylation of HIV-1 Rev by protein kinase CK2 is strictly dependent on
the regulatory beta subunit of the kinase and is deeply affected by
conformational changes of the substrate outside the phosphorylation site. Here we
show that Rev modulates a variety of CK2 properties, including
autophosphorylation, catalytic activity toward calmodulin, and susceptibility to 
polycationic effectors, whose common denominator is the involvement of the beta
subunit. Rev's two major CK2 sites are located at its N-terminus, immediately
adjacent to a helix-loop-helix motif. By comparing the behaviour of full-size Rev
with that of synthetic peptides reproducing, with suitable modifications, its
N-terminal 26 amino acids including the phosphoacceptor site (Ser 5, Ser 8) and
amphipathic helix-1, it appears that the functional interaction of the N-terminal
portion of Rev with the N-terminal domain of the beta subunit must rely on both
electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The former mainly involve Rev's
arginine-rich domain (residues 35-50) in helix-2, while the latter are mostly
mediated by residues 12-24 of helix-1. These data disclose the possibility that, 
besides displaying protective, regulatory and targeting properties with respect
to the catalytic subunit, the CK2 beta subunit also plays a role as a docking
site for a subset of CK2 substrates.
