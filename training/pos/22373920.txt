Adaptation to the host cell environment to efficiently take-over the host cell's 
machinery is crucial in particular for small RNA viruses like picornaviruses that
come with only small RNA genomes and replicate exclusively in the cytosol. Their 
Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) elements are specific RNA structures that
facilitate the 5' end-independent internal initiation of translation both under
normal conditions and when the cap-dependent host protein synthesis is shut-down 
in infected cells. A longstanding issue is which host factors play a major role
in this internal initiation. Here, we show that the functionally most important
domain V of the poliovirus IRES uses tRNA(Gly) anticodon stem-loop mimicry to
recruit glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) to the apical part of domain V, adjacent to
the binding site of the key initiation factor eIF4G. The binding of GARS promotes
the accommodation of the initiation region of the IRES in the mRNA binding site
of the ribosome, thereby greatly enhancing the activity of the IRES at the step
of the 48S initiation complex formation. Moonlighting functions of GARS that may 
be additionally needed for other events of the virus-host cell interaction are
discussed.
