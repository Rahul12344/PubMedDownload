When expressed in heterologous cells, the viral FLIP protein (vFLIP) of
Kaposi's-sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been reported both to block
Fas-mediated apoptosis and to activate the NF-kappaB activation pathway by
interaction with IkappaB kinase (IKK). In a yeast-two-hybrid screen, we
identified IKKgamma as an interacting partner of vFLIP. We expressed fragments of
IKKgamma in mammalian cells and bacteria, and identified the central CCR3/4
(amino acids 150-272) as the vFLIP binding region. To investigate the proteins
interacting with vFLIP in a KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cell
line, we immunoprecipitated vFLIP and identified four associated proteins by mass
spectrometry: IKK components IKKalpha, beta and gamma, and the chaperone, Hsp90. 
Using gel filtration chromatography, we demonstrated that a single population of 
vFLIP in the cytoplasm of PEL cells co-eluted and co-precipitated with an
activated IKK complex. An inhibitor of Hsp90, geldanamycin, inhibited IKK's
kinase activity induced by vFLIP and killed PEL cells, suggesting that vFLIP
activation of IKK contributes to PEL cell survival.
