The NS3 protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has a serine protease activity in its 
N-terminal region, which plays a crucial role in virus replication. This region
has also been reported to interact not only with its viral cofactor NS4A, but
also with a number of host-cell proteins, which suggests a multifunctional
feature of NS3. By means of yeast two-hybrid screening using an N-terminal region
of NS3 as bait, a human cDNA encoding a region of ELKS-delta, a member of a novel
family of proteins involved in intracellular transport and secretory pathways,
was molecularly cloned. Using co-immunoprecipitation, GST pull-down and confocal 
and immunoelectron microscopic analyses, it was shown that full-length NS3
interacted physically with full-length ELKS-delta and its splice variant,
ELKS-alpha, both in the absence and presence of NS4A, in cultured human cells,
including Huh-7 cells harbouring an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon. The degree of
binding to ELKS-delta varied with different sequences of the N-terminal 180
residues of NS3. Interestingly, NS3, either full-length or N-terminal fragments, 
enhanced secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from the cells, and
the increase in SEAP secretion correlated well with the degree of binding between
NS3 and ELKS-delta. Taken together, these results suggest the possibility that
NS3 plays a role in modulating host-cell functions such as intracellular
transport and secretion through its binding to ELKS-delta and ELKS-alpha, which
may facilitate the virus life cycle and/or mediate the pathogenesis of HCV.
