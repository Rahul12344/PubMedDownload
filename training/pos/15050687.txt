Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein is one of the soluble
neurotoxins. Most studies have to date focused on Tat as an extracellular
molecule and its role in neuronal apoptosis, as recombinant Tat protein is often 
used in these studies. In this study, we expressed Tat protein in astrocytes and 
neurons, and examined its effects on these cells. We found that Tat expression
resulted in growth inhibition of astrocytes, neurons, as well as non-glial cells 
293T. We further showed that Tat interacted with a number of cell cycle-related
proteins including cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin D3, Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk1/Cdc2, cdc6,
p27, p53, p63, hdlg, and PCNA. These data demonstrate that Tat inhibited cell
proliferation when expressed intracellularly, and suggest that Tat interactions
with multiple cell cycle regulators may account for this anti-proliferative
effect. These results support the notion that Tat-induced neuropathogenesis is
mediated by multiple mechanisms involving both intracellular and extracellular
Tat protein.
