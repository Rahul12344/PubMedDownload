Mammalian genomes encode two related serine-threonine kinases, nuclear Dbf2
related (NDR)1 and NDR2, which are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
Dbf2 kinase. Recently, a yeast genetic screen implicated the Dbf2 kinase in Ty1
retrotransposition. Since several virion-incorporated kinases regulate the
infectivity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we speculated that
the human NDR1 and NDR2 kinases might play a role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Here
we show that the NDR1 and NDR2 kinases were incorporated into HIV-1 particles.
Furthermore, NDR1 and NDR2 were cleaved by the HIV-1 protease (PR), both within
virions and within producer cells. Truncation at the PR cleavage site altered
NDR2 subcellular localization and inhibited NDR1 and NDR2 enzymatic activity.
These studies identify two new virion-associated host cell enzymes and suggest a 
novel mechanism by which HIV-1 alters the intracellular environment of human
cells.
