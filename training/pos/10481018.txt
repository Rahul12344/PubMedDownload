The contribution of human DNA polymerase epsilon to nuclear DNA replication was
studied. Antibody K18 that specifically inhibits DNA polymerase activity of human
DNA polymerase epsilon in vitro significantly inhibits DNA synthesis both when
microinjected into nuclei of exponentially growing human fibroblasts and in
isolated HeLa cell nuclei. The capability of this neutralizing antibody to
inhibit DNA synthesis in cells is comparable to that of monoclonal antibody
SJK-132-20 against DNA polymerase alpha. Contrary to the antibody against DNA
polymerase alpha, antibody K18 against DNA polymerase epsilon did not inhibit
SV40 DNA replication in vitro. These results indicate that DNA polymerase epsilon
plays a role in replicative DNA synthesis in proliferating human cells like DNA
polymerase alpha, and that this role for DNA polymerase epsilon cannot be modeled
by SV40 DNA replication.
