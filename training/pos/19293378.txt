Current knowledge suggests that the balance between life and death within a cell 
can be controlled by the stable engagement of Bcl-2-related proapoptotic proteins
such as Bak, Bax, and Bim by survival proteins such as Bcl-2. BHRF1 is a
prosurvival molecule from Epstein-Barr virus that has a high degree of homology
to Bcl-2. To understand how BHRF1 blocks apoptosis, BHRF1 and mutants of BHRF1
were expressed in primary cells and an IL-2-dependent T cell line. BHRF1 bound
the Executioner Bak and, when cells were cultured without cytokines, BHRF1
associated with Bim. A point mutation that lost the ability to bind Bak retained 
its ability to bind Bim and to protect cells. This result demonstrated that it
was the capacity of BHRF1 to bind Bim, not Bak, that provided protection.
Interestingly, the amount of Bim bound by BHRF1 was minimal when compared with
the amount of Bim induced by apoptosis. Thus, BHRF1 does not act by simply
absorbing the excess Bim produced while cells prepare for death. Rather, BHRF1
may act either by binding preferentially the most lethal form of Bim or by acting
catalytically on Bim to block apoptosis.
