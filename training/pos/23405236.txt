Human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hGBP1) is an interferon-inducible protein
involved in the host immune response against viral infection. In response to
infection by influenza A virus (IAV), hGBP1 transcript and protein were
significantly upregulated. Overexpression of hGBP1 inhibited IAV replication in a
dose-dependent manner in vitro. The lysine residue at position 51 (K51) of hGBP1 
was essential for inhibition of IAV replication. Mutation of K51 resulted in an
hGBP1 that was unable to inhibit IAV replication. The viral nonstructural protein
1 (NS1) was found to interact directly with hGBP1. K51 of hGBP1 and a region
between residues 123 and 144 in NS1 were demonstrated to be essential for the
interaction between NS1 and hGBP1. Binding of NS1 to hGBP1 resulted in a
significant reduction in both GTPase activity and the anti-IAV activity of hGBP1.
These findings indicated that hGBP1 contributed to the host immune response
against IAV replication and that hGBP1-mediated antiviral activity was
antagonized by NS1 via binding to hGBP1.
