Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a small DNA virus that targets the liver and infects
humans worldwide. Recently we have shown that the metabolic regulator PGC-1alpha 
coactivates HBV transcription thereby rendering the virus susceptible to
fluctuations in the nutritional status of the liver. PGC-1alpha coactivation of
HBV is mediated through the liver-enriched nuclear receptor HNF4alpha and through
another yet unknown transcription factor(s). Here we show that the forkhead
transcription factor FOXO1, a known target for PGC-1alpha coactivation and a
central mediator of glucose metabolism in the liver, binds HBV core promoter and 
activates its transcription. This activation is further enhanced in the presence 
of PGC-1alpha, implying that FOXO1 is a target for PGC-1alpha coactivation of HBV
transcription. Thus, our results identify another key metabolic regulator as an
activator of HBV transcription, thereby supporting the principle that HBV gene
expression is regulated in a similar way to key hepatic metabolic genes.
