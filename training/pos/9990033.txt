Although present in many copies in the mouse genome, xenotropic murine leukemia
viruses cannot infect cells from laboratory mice because of the lack of a
functional cell surface receptor required for virus entry. In contrast, cells
from many nonmurine species, including human cells, are fully permissive. Using
an expression library approach, we isolated a cDNA from HeLa cell RNA that
conferred susceptibility to xenotropic envelope protein binding and virus
infection when expressed in nonpermissive cells. The deduced product is a 696-aa 
multiple-membrane spanning molecule, is widely expressed in human tissues, and
shares homology with nematode, fly, and plant proteins of unknown function as
well as with the yeast SYG1 protein, which has been shown to interact with a G
protein. This molecule also acts as a receptor for polytropic murine leukemia
viruses, consistent with observed interference between xenotropic and polytropic 
viruses in some cell types. This xenotropic and polytropic retrovirus receptor
(XPR1) is the fourth identified molecule having multiple membrane spanning
domains among mammalian type C oncoretrovirus receptors and may play a role in G 
protein-coupled signal transduction, as do the chemokine receptors required for
HIV entry.
