The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is part of the
viral replicative complex and plays a crucial role in HCV replication. It has
been described that NS5B interacts with cellular proteins, and that interactions 
between NS5B and host proteins are crucial for viral replication. Some of the
host factors involved in the HCV replication cycle include the oestrogen receptor
alpha (ESR1), protein kinases (c-Src) and chaperones (Hsp70). In this report, we 
determine the requirements for the interplay between NS5B and the domain C of
ESR1 (ESR1C) by using Förster Resonance Energy Transfer. NS5B-ESR1C and
ESR1C-ESR1C interactions are dependent on ionic strength, indicating that
contacts are mainly electrostatic. Additionally, NS5B residues involved in NS5B
oligomerization were also essential for NS5B-ESR1C interaction. The study of the 
interactions among viral and host factors will provide data to establish
innovative therapeutic strategies and the development of new antiviral drugs.
