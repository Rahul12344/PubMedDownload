NF-κB plays a key role in innate and acquired immunity. Its activity is regulated
through intricate signaling networks. Persistent or excessive activation of NF-κB
induces diseases, such as autoimmune disorders and malignant neoplasms. Infection
by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a fatal hematopoietic
malignancy termed adult T cell leukemia (ATL). The HTLV-1 viral oncoprotein Tax
functions pivotally in leukemogenesis through its potent activation of NF-κB.
Recent findings suggest that protein ubiquitination is crucial for proper
regulation of NF-κB signaling and for Tax activity. Here, we report that
ubiquitin-specific peptidase USP20 deubiquitinates TRAF6 and Tax and suppresses
interleukin 1β (IL-1β)- and Tax-induced NF-κB activation. Our results point to
USP20 as a key negative regulator of Tax-induced NF-κB signaling.
