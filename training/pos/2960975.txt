We have examined the relationship between sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins 
that activate transcription of E1A-inducible adenovirus early promoters. Factors 
previously referred to as E4F1 and E2A-EF bind to the E4 and E2A promoters,
respectively. We demonstrate here that E4F1 and E2A-EF have identical DNA-binding
specificity. Moreover, E4F1 and E2A-EF both activate transcription of the E4 and 
E2A promoters in vitro. These findings demonstrate that E4F1 and E2A-EF are the
same factor, which we have designated activating transcription factor, or ATF. In
addition to the E4 and E2A promoters, ATF binds to an important functional
element of the E1A-inducible E3 promoter. Interaction of a common activator
protein, ATF, with multiple E1A-inducible early viral promoters, suggests a
significant role for ATF in E1A-mediated transcriptional activation.
