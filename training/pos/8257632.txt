BTEB, a GC box-binding transcription factor, was tested for its ability to
activate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat (HIV-1
LTR). An electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated specific binding of
BTEB to GC boxes of the HIV-1 LTR. When a BTEB expression vector was
cotransfected into A3.01 cells with a fusion gene of HIV-1 LTR and
chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) structural gene, the CAT activity was
increased. This increase was accompanied by an increase in the content of CAT
mRNA. Transcriptional activity of the HIV-1 LTR, stimulated by Tat, was further
enhanced by the expression of BTEB. BTEB also activated the LTR activity in
cooperation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Northern blot analysis showed
that various T cell and macrophage/monocyte cell lines expressed the BTEB mRNA to
a level comparable with that of Sp1, another GC box-binding transcription factor.
These results suggest that BTEB, like Sp1, is involved in transcriptional
activation of the HIV-1 LTR.
