The chicken anemia virus protein Apoptin induces apoptosis in the absence of p53 
by a mechanism that remains to be elucidated. Here we show that in transformed
cells, Apoptin is associated with APC1, a subunit of the anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C). We demonstrate that Apoptin expression, or depletion
of APC1 by RNA interference, inhibits APC/C function in p53 null cells, resulting
in G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Our results explain the ability of Apoptin to
induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 and suggest that the APC/C is an
attractive target for anticancer drug development.
