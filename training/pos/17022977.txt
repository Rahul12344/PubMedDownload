Influenza virus matrix protein 1 (M1) has been shown to play a crucial role in
the virus replication, assembly and budding. We identified heat shock cognate
protein 70 (Hsc70) as a M1 binding protein by immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF
MS. The C terminal domain of M1 interacts with Hsc70. We found that Hsc70 does
not correlate with the transport of M1 to the nucleus, however, it does inhibit
the nuclear export of M1 and NP, thus resulting in the inhibition of viral
production. This is the first demonstration that Hsc70 is directly associated
with M1 and therefore is required for viral production.
