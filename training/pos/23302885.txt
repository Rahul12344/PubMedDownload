The adenovirus large E1A (L-E1A) protein is a prototypical transcriptional
activator, and it functions through the action of a conserved transcriptional
activation domain, CR3. CR3 interacts with a mediator subunit, MED23, that has
been linked to the transcriptional activity of CR3. Our unbiased proteomic
analysis revealed that human adenovirus 5 (HAdv5) L-E1A was associated with many 
mediator subunits. In MED23-depleted cells and in Med23 knockout (KO) cells,
L-E1A was deficient in association with other mediator subunits, suggesting that 
MED23 links CR3 with the mediator complex. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
depletion of several mediator subunits suggested differential effects of various 
subunits on transcriptional activation of HAdv5 early genes. In addition to
MED23, mediator subunits such as MED14 and MED26 were also essential for the
transcription of HAdv5 early genes. The L-E1A proteome contained MED26-associated
super elongation complex. The catalytic component of the elongation complex,
CDK9, was important for the transcriptional activity of L-E1A and HAdv5
replication. Our results suggest that L-E1A-mediated transcriptional activation
involves a transcriptional elongation step, like HIV Tat, and constitutes a
therapeutic target for inhibition of HAdv replication.
