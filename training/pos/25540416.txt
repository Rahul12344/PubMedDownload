Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) conversion of B-lymphocytes to Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines
(LCLs) requires four EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) oncoproteins: EBNA2, EBNALP,
EBNA3A, and EBNA3C. EBNA2 and EBNALP associate with EBV and cell enhancers,
up-regulate the EBNA promoter, MYC, and EBV Latent infection Membrane Proteins
(LMPs), which up-regulate BCL2 to protect EBV-infected B-cells from MYC
proliferation-induced cell death. LCL proliferation induces p16(INK4A) and
p14(ARF)-mediated cell senescence. EBNA3A and EBNA3C jointly suppress p16(INK4A) 
and p14(ARF), enabling continuous cell proliferation. Analyses of the EBNA3A
human genome-wide ChIP-seq landscape revealed 37% of 10,000 EBNA3A sites to be at
strong enhancers; 28% to be at weak enhancers; 4.4% to be at active promoters;
and 6.9% to be at weak and poised promoters. EBNA3A colocalized with BATF-IRF4,
ETS-IRF4, RUNX3, and other B-cell Transcription Factors (TFs). EBNA3A sites
clustered into seven unique groups, with differing B-cell TFs and epigenetic
marks. EBNA3A coincidence with BATF-IRF4 or RUNX3 was associated with stronger
EBNA3A ChIP-Seq signals. EBNA3A was at MYC, CDKN2A/B, CCND2, CXCL9/10, and BCL2, 
together with RUNX3, BATF, IRF4, and SPI1. ChIP-re-ChIP revealed complexes of
EBNA3A on DNA with BATF. These data strongly support a model in which EBNA3A is
tethered to DNA through a BATF-containing protein complexes to enable continuous 
cell proliferation.
