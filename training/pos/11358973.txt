The human TR2 orphan receptor (TR2), initially isolated from testis and prostate 
cDNA libraries, is a member of the steroid receptor superfamily. TR2 can regulate
several target genes via binding to a consensus response element (AGGTCA) in
direct repeat orientation (AGGTCAX((n))AGGTCA, n = 0-6). Here we show that TR2 is
able to induce the expression of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) genes via
binding to a DR4 response element in the long control region of HPV-16.
Additionally, one of the HPV-16 gene products, the E6 oncogene, regulates TR2
gene expression. A likely mechanism for this regulation involves E6-mediated
degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, a protein known to suppress TR2
expression. Together our data provide evidence for feedback regulation between
TR2 and HPV-16, which represents a novel regulatory pathway involving a member of
the steroid receptor superfamily and the HPV-16 DNA tumor virus.
