Some viruses exploit internal initiation for their propagation in the host cell. 
This type of initiation is facilitated by structured elements (internal ribosome 
entry site, IRES) upstream of the initiator AUG and requires only a reduced
number of canonical initiation factors. An important example are IRES of the
virus family Dicistroviridae that bind to the inter-subunit side of the small
ribosomal 40S subunit and lead to the formation of elongation-competent 80S
ribosomes without the help of any initiation factor. Here, we present a
comprehensive functional and structural analysis of eukaryotic-specific ribosomal
protein rpS25 in the context of this type of initiation and propose a structural 
model explaining the essential involvement of rpS25 for hijacking the ribosome.
