HTLV-1 infection causes adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). The development of ATL is
thought to be associated with disruption of transcriptional control of cellular
genes. HTLV-1 basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) factor, HBZ, is encoded by the
complementary strand of the provirus. We previously reported that HBZ interacts
with c-Jun and suppresses its transcriptional activity. To identify the cellular 
factor(s) that interact with HBZ, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen using
full-length HBZ as bait and identified MafB. HBZ heterodimerizes with MafB via
each bZIP domain. Luciferase analysis revealed a significant decrease in
transcription through Maf recognition element (MARE) in a manner dependent on the
bZIP domain of HBZ. Indeed, production of full-length HBZ in cells decreased the 
MARE-bound MafB protein, indicating that HBZ abrogates the DNA-binding activity
of MafB. In addition, HBZ reduced the steady-state levels of MafB, and the levels
were restored by treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. These results suggest a
suppressive effect of HBZ on Maf function, which may have a significant role in
HTLV-1 related pathogenesis.
