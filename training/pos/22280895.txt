Poxviruses are large double-stranded DNA viruses that replicate exclusively in
the cytoplasm of infected cells within discrete compartments termed viral
factories. Recent work has shown that the prototypical poxvirus, Vaccinia Virus
(VacV) sequesters components of the eukaryotic translation initiation complex
eIF4F within viral factories while also stimulating formation of eIF4F complexes.
However, the forces that govern these events remain unknown. Here, we show that
maximal eIF4F formation requires viral DNA replication and the formation of viral
factories, suggesting that sequestration functions to promote eIF4F assembly, and
identify the ssDNA-binding protein, I3 as a viral factor that interacts and
co-localizes with the eIF4F scaffold protein, eIF4G. Although it did not
adversely affect host or viral protein synthesis, I3 specifically mediated the
binding of eIF4G to ssDNA. Combined, our findings offer an explanation for the
specific pattern and temporal process of eIF4G redistribution and eIF4F complex
assembly within VacV-infected cells.
