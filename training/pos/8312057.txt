We have developed a MAb-based capture assay to study the association of host cell
membrane proteins with HIV and SIV. Class I and II MHC proteins were found to be 
associated with HIV as previously described. In addition to these molecules a
number of other host molecules were found to be acquired by HIV, including CD71, 
CD63, CD43, and CD8. We have demonstrated that the major leukocyte adhesion
receptors LFA-1 (CD11A/CD18) and CD44 are also associated with HIV. The level of 
surface expression of host membrane proteins did not predict relative expression 
(capture efficiency) of the virus. The use of virus-susceptible indicator cells
showed that the assay involved host membrane protein-mediated capture of
infectious HIV and SIV particles. Our data indicate that HIV and SIV acquire a
number of host membrane proteins including adhesion receptors and that this
process may be nonrandom. The acquisition of host cell adhesion receptors by HIV 
and SIV could have profound effects on the biology of the viruses, including
binding, infectivity, and tropism.
