Rubella virus (RV) is a highly transmissible pathogenic agent that causes the
disease rubella. Maternal RV infection during early pregnancy causes the death of
the fetus or congenital rubella syndrome in infants. However, the cellular
receptor for RV has not yet been identified. In this study, we found that the
myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) specifically bound to the E1 envelope
glycoprotein of RV, and an antibody against MOG could block RV infection. Most
importantly, we also showed that ectopic expression of MOG on the cell surface of
293T cells rendered this nonpermissive cell line permissive for RV entry and
replication. Thus, this study has identified a cellular receptor for RV and
suggests that blocking the MOG attachment site of RV may be a strategy for
molecular intervention of RV infection.
