Stress granules (SGs) are cytoplasmic foci composed of stalled translation
preinitiation complexes induced by environmental stress stimuli, including viral 
infection. Since viral propagation completely depends on the host translational
machinery, many viruses have evolved to circumvent the induction of SGs or co-opt
SG components. In this study, we found that expression of Japanese encephalitis
virus (JEV) core protein inhibits SG formation. Caprin-1 was identified as a
binding partner of the core protein by an affinity capture mass spectrometry
analysis. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that Lys(97) and Arg(98) in the
Î±-helix of the JEV core protein play a crucial role in the interaction with
Caprin-1. In cells infected with a mutant JEV in which Lys(97) and Arg(98) were
replaced with alanines in the core protein, the inhibition of SG formation was
abrogated, and viral propagation was impaired. Furthermore, the mutant JEV
exhibited attenuated virulence in mice. These results suggest that the JEV core
protein circumvents translational shutoff by inhibiting SG formation through an
interaction with Caprin-1 and facilitates viral propagation in vitro and in vivo.
