Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in 
up to 70 percent of infected patients, and there is evidence of human-to-human
transmission. Endothelial syncytia, comprised of multinucleated giant-endothelial
cells, are frequently found in NiV infections, and are mediated by the fusion (F)
and attachment (G) envelope glycoproteins. Identification of the receptor for
this virus will shed light on the pathobiology of NiV infection, and spur the
rational development of effective therapeutics. Here we report that ephrinB2, the
membrane-bound ligand for the EphB class of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
specifically binds to the attachment (G) glycoprotein of NiV. Soluble Fc-fusion
proteins of ephrinB2, but not ephrinB1, effectively block NiV fusion and entry
into permissive cell types. Moreover, transfection of ephrinB2 into
non-permissive cells renders them permissive for NiV fusion and entry. EphrinB2
is expressed on endothelial cells and neurons, which is consistent with the known
cellular tropism for NiV. Significantly, we find that NiV-envelope-mediated
infection of microvascular endothelial cells and primary cortical rat neurons is 
inhibited by soluble ephrinB2, but not by the related ephrinB1 protein.
Cumulatively, our data show that ephrinB2 is a functional receptor for NiV.
