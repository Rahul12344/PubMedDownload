ICP34.5, encoded by herpes simplex virus 1, is a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)
regulatory subunit that mediates dephosphorylation of the alpha subunit of
translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha). However, the mechanism of its action
remains poorly understood. Here, we show that amino acid substitutions in the
arginine-rich motif have differential effects on ICP34.5 activity. The phenotypes
parallel with viral protein synthesis and cytopathic effects in virus infected
cells. Besides the consensus PP1 binding motif, the Arg-motif appears to enhance 
the interaction between ICP34.5 and PP1. These results suggest that concerted
action between the PP1 binding domain and the effector domain of ICP34.5 is
crucial for eIF2alpha dephosphorylation and viral protein synthesis.
