Translation of most mRNAs is suppressed under stress conditions. Phosphorylation 
of the α-subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which
delivers initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) to the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit,
is responsible for such translational suppression. However, translation of
hepatitis C viral (HCV) mRNA is refractory to the inhibitory effects of eIF2α
phosphorylation, which prevents translation by disrupting formation of the
eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA(i) ternary complex. Here, we report that eIF2A, an alternative 
initiator tRNA-binding protein, has a key role in the translation of HCV mRNA
during HCV infection, in turn promoting eIF2α phosphorylation by activating the
eIF2α kinase PKR. Direct interaction of eIF2A with the IIId domain of the HCV
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is required for eIF2A-dependent translation. 
These data indicate that stress-independent translation of HCV mRNA occurs by
recruitment of eIF2A to the HCV IRES via direct interaction with the IIId domain 
and subsequent loading of Met-tRNA(i) to the P site of the 40S ribosomal subunit.
