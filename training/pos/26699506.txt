Various host factors are involved in the cellular entry of hepatitis C virus
(HCV). In addition to the factors previously reported, we discovered that the
very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) mediates HCV entry independent of
CD81. Culturing Huh7.5 cells under hypoxic conditions significantly increased HCV
entry as a result of the expression of VLDLR, which was not expressed under
normoxic conditions in this cell line. Ectopic VLDLR expression conferred
susceptibility to HCV entry of CD81-deficient Huh7.5 cells. Additionally,
VLDLR-mediated HCV entry was not affected by the knockdown of cellular factors
known to act as HCV receptors or HCV entry factors. Because VLDLR is expressed in
primary human hepatocytes, our results suggest that VLDLR functions in vivo as an
HCV receptor independent of canonical CD81-mediated HCV entry.
