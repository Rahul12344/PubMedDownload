Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), which is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded
oncoprotein, induces nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling by mimicking
the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR). LMP1 signals primarily from
intracellular compartments in a ligand-independent manner. Here, we identify a
new LMP1-interacting molecule, prenylated Rab acceptor 1 (PRA1), which interacts 
with LMP1 for the first time through LMP1's transmembrane domain, and show that
PRA1 is involved in intracellular LMP1 trafficking and LMP1-induced NF-kappaB
activity. Immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses revealed that LMP1
physically interacted with PRA1 at the Golgi apparatus, and the colocalization of
LMP1 and PRA1 to the Golgi was sensitive to nocodazole and brefeldin A.
Coexpression of a PRA1 export mutant or knockdown of PRA1 led to redistribution
of LMP1 and its associated signaling molecules to the endoplasmic reticulum and
subsequent impairment of LMP1-induced NF-kappaB activation, but had no effect on 
CD40- and TNFR1-mediated signaling or the functional integrity of the Golgi
apparatus. These novel findings provide important new insights into LMP1, and
identify an unexpected new role for PRA1 in cellular signaling.
