The non-structural protein 4B (NS4B) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein comprising two consecutive
amphipathic α-helical domains (AH1 and AH2). Its self-oligomerization via the AH2
domain is required for the formation of the membranous web that is necessary for 
viral replication. Previously, we reported that the host-encoded ER-associated
reticulon 3 (RTN3) protein is involved in the formation of the
replication-associated membranes of (+)RNA enteroviruses during viral
replication. In this study, we demonstrated that the second transmembrane region 
of RTN3 competed for, and bound to, the AH2 domain of NS4B, thus abolishing NS4B 
self-interaction and leading to the downregulation of viral replication. This
interaction was mediated by two crucial residues, lysine 52 and tyrosine 63, of
AH2, and was regulated by the AH1 domain. The silencing of RTN3 in Huh7 and AVA5 
cells harbouring an HCV replicon enhanced the replication of HCV, which was
counteracted by the overexpression of recombinant RTN3. The synthesis of viral
RNA was also increased in siRNA-transfected human primary hepatocytes infected
with HCV derived from cell culture. Our results demonstrated that RTN3 acted as a
restriction factor to limit the replication of HCV.
