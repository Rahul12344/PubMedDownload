HPV-16E7 is a major transforming protein, which has been implicated in the
development of cervical cancer. The stability of E7 is thus important to ensure
its fully functional status. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that
USP11 (ubiquitin-specific protease 11), a member of a protein family that cleaves
polyubiquitin chains and/or ubiquitin precursors, interacts and forms a specific 
complex with HPV-16E7. Our results indicate that the USP11 can greatly increase
the steady state level of HPV-16E7 by reducing ubiquitination and attenuating E7 
degradation. In contrast, a catalytically inactive mutant of USP11 abolished the 
deubiquitinating ability and returned E7 to a normal rate of degradation.
Moreover, USP11 not only protected E7 from ubiquitination but also influenced E7 
function as a modulator of cell growth status. These results suggest that USP11
plays an important role in regulating the levels of E7 protein and subsequently
affects the biological function of E7 as well as its contribution to cell
transformation by HPV-16E7.
