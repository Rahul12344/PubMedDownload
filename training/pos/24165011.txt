BACKGROUND: HIV-1 infection results in hyper-immune activation and immunological 
disorders as early as the asymptomatic stage. Here, we hypothesized that during
early HIV-1 infection, HIV-1 Tat protein acts on monocytes/macrophages to induce 
anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines and participates in immune
dysregulation.
RESULTS: In this work we showed that Tat protein: i) by its N-terminal domain
induces production of both IL-10 and TNF-α in a TLR4-MD2 dependent manner, ii)
interacts specifically with TLR4-MD2 and MD2 with high affinity but not with
CD14, iii) induces in vivo TNF-α and IL-10 in a TLR4 dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data showed for the first time that, HIV-1 Tat
interacts physically with high affinity with TLR4-MD2 to promote proinflammatory 
cytokines (TNF-α) and the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 both involved in
immune dysregulation during early HIV-1 infection and AIDS progression.
