Viral RNA elements that facilitate mRNA export are useful tools for identifying
cellular RNA export factors. Here we show that hepatitis B virus
post-transcriptional element (PRE) is one such element, and using PRE several new
cellular mRNA export factors were identified. We found that PRE drastically
enhances the cytoplasmic accumulation of cDNA transcripts independent of any
viral protein. Systematic deletion analysis revealed the existence of a 116 nt
functional Sub-Element of PRE (SEP1). The RNP that forms on the SEP1 RNA was
affinity purified, in which TREX components as well as several other proteins
were identified. TREX components and the SEP1-associating protein ZC3H18 are
required for SEP1-mediated mRNA export. Significantly, ZC3H18 directly binds to
the SEP1 RNA, interacts with TREX and is required for stable association of TREX 
with the SEP1-containing mRNA. Requirements for SEP1-mediated mRNA export are
similar to those for splicing-dependent mRNA export. Consistent with these
similarities, several SEP1-interacting proteins, including ZC3H18, ARS2, Acinus
and Brr2, are required for efficient nuclear export of polyA RNAs. Together, our 
data indicate that SEP1 enhances mRNA export by recruiting TREX via ZC3H18. The
new mRNA export factors that we identified might be involved in cap- and
splicing-dependent TREX recruitment to cellular mRNAs.
