In pro- and eukaryotic cells, RuvB-like protein 2 (RBL2) resolves Holliday
junction recombination intermediates. Here, we identified RBL2 as a suppressor of
influenza A virus replication. Human RBL2 appears to interfere with the
oligomerization of the viral nucleoprotein, a critical step in the assembly of
viral replication complexes.
