Zyxin, a focal adhesion molecule, interacts specifically with the E6 protein from
human papillomavirus (HPV) type 6 in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a cDNA library 
prepared from human keratinocytes. Zyxin does not interact significantly with E6 
proteins from HPV types 11, 16, or 18. The interaction was confirmed by in vitro 
and in vivo analyses and it requires the LIM domains (Lin-11, Isl-1, and Mec-3
[G. Freyd, S. K. Kim, and H. R. Horvitz, Nature 344:876-879, 1990]) found at the 
carboxyl terminus of zyxin. Cotransfection of E6 from HPV ((6)E6) and zyxin
results in the accumulation of zyxin in the nucleus where it can function as a
transcriptional activator. (6)E6 can also mobilize endogenous zyxin to the
nucleus.
