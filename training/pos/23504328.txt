Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a transcription factor, Rta, which is required
to activate the transcription of EBV lytic genes. This study demonstrates that
treating P3HR1 cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, causes the accumulation 
of SUMO-Rta and promotes the expression of EA-D. GST pulldown and
coimmunoprecipitation studies reveal that RNF4, a RING-domain-containing
ubiquitin E3 ligase, interacts with Rta. RNF4 also targets SUMO-2-conjugated Rta 
and promotes its ubiquitination in vitro. Additionally, SUMO interaction motifs
in RNF4 are important to the ubiquitination of Rta because the RNF4 mutant with a
mutation at the motifs eliminates ubiquitination. The mutation of four lysine
residues on Rta that abrogated SUMO-3 conjugation to Rta also decreases the
enhancement of the ubiquitination of Rta by RNF4. This finding demonstrates that 
RNF4 is a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase of Rta. Finally, knockdown of RNF4
enhances the expression of Rta and EA-D, subsequently promoting EBV lytic
replication and virions production. Results of this study significantly
contribute to efforts to elucidate a SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase that
regulates Rta ubiquitination to influence the lytic development of EBV.
