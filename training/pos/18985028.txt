A proteome-wide mapping of interactions between hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human
proteins was performed to provide a comprehensive view of the cellular infection.
A total of 314 protein-protein interactions between HCV and human proteins was
identified by yeast two-hybrid and 170 by literature mining. Integration of this 
data set into a reconstructed human interactome showed that cellular proteins
interacting with HCV are enriched in highly central and interconnected proteins. 
A global analysis on the basis of functional annotation highlighted the
enrichment of cellular pathways targeted by HCV. A network of proteins associated
with frequent clinical disorders of chronically infected patients was constructed
by connecting the insulin, Jak/STAT and TGFbeta pathways with cellular proteins
targeted by HCV. CORE protein appeared as a major perturbator of this network.
Focal adhesion was identified as a new function affected by HCV, mainly by NS3
and NS5A proteins.
