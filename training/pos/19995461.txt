NS1 protein is the only non-structural protein encoded by the influenza A virus, 
and it contributes significantly to disease pathogenesis by modulating many virus
and host cell processes. A two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with NS1 
from influenza A yielded growth arrest-specific protein 8. Gas8 associated with
NS1 in vitro and in vivo. Deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal 260
amino acids of Gas8 were able to interact with NS1, and neither the RNA-binding
domain nor the effector domain of NS1 was sufficient for the NS1 interaction. We 
also found that actin, myosin, and drebrin interact with Gas8. NS1 and beta-actin
proteins could be co-immunoprecipitated from extracts of transfected cells.
Furthermore, actin and Gas8 co-localized at the plasma membrane. These results
are discussed in relation to the possible functions of Gas8 protein and their
relevance in influenza virus release.
