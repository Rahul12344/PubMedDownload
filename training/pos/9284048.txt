p21 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA)-dependent DNA replication by binding to CDK/cyclin
complexes and to PCNA through distinct domains. The human papillomavirus (HPV)-16
E7 oncoprotein (16E7) abrogated a DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest in vivo,
despite high levels of p21. Using cell lysates and purified proteins we show that
16E7 prevented p21 both from inhibiting CDK2/cyclin E activity and PCNA-dependent
DNA replication, whereas the nononcogenic HPV-6 E7 had reduced effects.
Inactivation of both inhibitory functions of p21 was attained through binding
between 16E7 and sequences in the carboxy-terminal end of p21 that overlap with
the PCNA-binding site and the second p21 cyclin-binding motif. These data imply
that the carboxyl terminus of p21 simultaneously modulates both CDK activity and 
PCNA-dependent DNA replication and that a single protein, 16E7, can override this
modulation to disrupt normal cell cycle control.
