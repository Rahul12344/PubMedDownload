Apoptin, a chicken anemia virus-encoded protein, induces apoptosis in human tumor
cells but not in normal cells. The tumor-specific activity of Apoptin is
correlated with its nuclear localization in tumor cells. In an attempt to
elucidate the molecular mechanism of Apoptin-induced apoptosis, we identified
human Hippi, the protein interactor and apoptosis co-mediator of Huntingtin
interacting protein 1, as one of the Apoptin-associated proteins by yeast
two-hybrid screen. We also demonstrated that Hippi could interact with Apoptin
both in vitro and in human cells. Furthermore, subcellular localization studies
showed that Hippi and Apoptin perfectly colocalized in the cytoplasm of normal
human HEL cells, whereas in cancerous HeLa cells most Apoptin and Hippi were
located separately in the nucleus and cytoplasm and, thus, showed only a modest
colocalization. Mapping studies indicate that Hippi binds within the
self-multimerization domain of Apoptin, and Apoptin binds to the C-terminal half 
of Hippi, including its death effector domain-like motif. Our results suggest
that the Apoptin-Hippi interaction may play a role in the suppression of
apoptosis in normal cells.
