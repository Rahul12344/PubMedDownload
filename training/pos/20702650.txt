The small hydrophobic (SH) protein of mumps virus has been reported to interfere 
with innate immunity by inhibiting tumour necrosis factor alpha-mediated
apoptosis. In a yeast two-hybrid screen we have identified the ataxin-1
ubiquitin-like interacting protein (A1Up) as a cellular target of the SH protein.
A1Up contains an amino-terminal ubiquitin-like (UbL) domain, a carboxy-terminal
ubiquitin-associated (UbA) domain and two stress-inducible heat shock
chaperonin-binding (Sti1) motifs. This places it within the ubiquitin-like
protein family that is involved in proteasome-mediated activities.
Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of SH and A1Up and demonstrates that
a truncated protein fragment corresponding to aa&emsp14;136-270 of A1Up, which
represents the first Sti1-like repeat and an adjacent hydrophobic region, was
sufficient for interaction, whereas neither the UbL nor the UbA domains were
required for interaction. The ectopic expression of A1Up leads to a
redistribution of SH to punctate structures that co-localize with the 20S
proteasome in transfected or infected mammalian cells.
