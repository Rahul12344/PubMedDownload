When tethered in cis to DNA, the transcriptional corepressor mSin3B inhibits
polyomavirus (Py) ori-dependent DNA replication in vivo. Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) appear not to be involved, since tethering class I and class II HDACs in 
cis does not inhibit replication and treating the cells with trichostatin A does 
not specifically relieve inhibition by mSin3B. However, the mSin3B L59P mutation 
that impairs mSin3B interaction with N-CoR/SMRT abrogates inhibition of
replication, suggesting the involvement of N-CoR/SMRT. Py large T antigen
interacts with mSin3B, suggesting an HDAC-independent mechanism by which mSin3B
inhibits DNA replication.
