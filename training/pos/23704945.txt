PB1-F2, a protein encoded by a second open reading frame of the influenza virus
RNA segment 2, has emerged as a modulator of lung inflammatory responses but the 
molecular mechanisms underlying this are only poorly understood. Here we show
that PB1-F2 inhibits the activation of NF-κB dependent signalling pathways in
luciferase reporter assays. PB1-F2 proteins from four different viruses interact 
with IKKβ in yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation. PB1-F2
expression did not inhibit IKKβ kinase activity or NF-κB translocation into the
nucleus, but NF-κB binding to DNA was severely impaired in PB1-F2 transfected
cells as assessed by Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay. Neither the N-terminal
57 amino acid truncated forms nor the C-terminus of PB1-F2 were able to inhibit
NF-κB dependent signalling, indicating that the full length protein is necessary 
for the inhibition.
