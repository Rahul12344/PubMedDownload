Stabilization of the globular structure of ferricytochrome c by chloride in
acidic solvents.

Stellwagen E, Babul J.

Increasing concentrations of chloride were found to increase the resolution
between two visible absorbance spectral transitions associated with acidification
of ferricytochrome c. Analysis of a variety of spectral and viscosity
measurements indicates that protonation of a single group having an apparent pK
of 2.1 +/- 0.2 and an intrinsic pK of about 5.3 displaces the methionine ligand
without significantly perturbing the native globular conformation. Analysis of
methylated ferricytochrome c suggests that protonation of a carboxylate ion, most
likely a heme propionate residue, is responsible for displacement of the
methionine ligand. Addition of a proton to a second group having an apparent pK
of 1.2 +/- 0.1 displaces the histidine ligand and unfolds the protein from a
globular conformation into a random coil. It is most likely that the second
protonation occurs on the imidazole ring of the histidine ligand itself. Chloride
is proposed to perturb these transitions by ligation in the fifth coordination
position of the heme ion. Such ligation stabilizes a globular conformation of
ferricytochrome c at pH 0.0 and 25 degrees.
