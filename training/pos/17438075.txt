In macrophages, HIV-1 has been shown to bud into intracellular structures that
contain the late endosome marker CD63. We show that these organelles are not
endosomes, but an internally sequestered plasma membrane domain. Using
immunofluorescence microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we find that HIV-1
buds into a compartment that contains the tetraspanins CD81, CD9, and CD53. On
uninfected macrophages, these proteins are seen at the cell surface and in
intracellular vacuole-like structures with a complex content of vesicles and
interconnected membranes that lack endosome markers, including CD63.
Significantly, these structures are accessible to small tracers (horseradish
peroxidase or ruthenium red) applied to cells at 4 degrees C, indicating that
they are connected to the cell surface. HIV assembles on, and accumulates within,
these intracellular compartments. Furthermore, CD63 is recruited to the
virus-containing structures and incorporated into virions. These results indicate
that, in macrophages, HIV-1 exploits a previously undescribed intracellular
plasma membrane domain to assemble infectious particles.
