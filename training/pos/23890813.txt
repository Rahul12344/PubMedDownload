TNF receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2) plays a very important role in cellular 
innate immune as well as inflammatory responses. Previous studies have reported
TRAF2 mediated regulation of TNF and Interferon (IFN) induced canonical and
non-canonical activation of NFκB. In this study, we show that rotavirus NSP1
targets TRAF2 to regulate IFN induced non-canonical NFκB activation. Here we
found that rotavirus Non-Structural Protein-1 (NSP1) interacts with TRAF2 and
degrades it in a proteasome dependent manner. C-terminal part of NSP1 was
sufficient for interacting with TRAF2 but it alone could not degrade TRAF2. This 
inhibition of interferon mediated non-canonical NFκB activation by NSP1 may
modulate inflammatory cytokine production after rotavirus infection to help the
virus propagation.
