Integrin epitopes encoded by ITGA4 exons 5 and 6 encompass the α4β7 binding site 
to natural ligands and HIV-1 gp120. Functional assays of α4 variants of new world
primates (NWP) showed reduced binding of several ligands, including the HIV-1
envelope, probably accounting for restriction phenotypes conferring resistance to
lentiviral infection (Darc et al., 2011). In this paper, we have analyzed, by
cloning and sequencing, the α4 domain polymorphisms present in 10 NWP species and
four old world primates (including human). Analyses of differential selection at 
codon sites and along evolutionary lineages were carried out. We identified
codons under positive selection, including polymorphic variations at codon 201,
presumably convergent during NWP radiation and significant positive selection
leading to a single allele (SagVar2).
