activates it ahead of schedule.

Expression of the human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)
transactivator/oncoprotein, Tax, leads to faulty mitosis as reflected by
chromosome aneuploidy, cytokinesis failure, and formation of micro- and
multinucleated cells. Here we show that HTLV-I-transformed T cells progress
through S/G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle with a delay. This delay is correlated 
with a decrease in the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B1, and securin. In
tax-expressing cells, the Cdc20-associated anaphase promoting complex
(APC(Cdc20)), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls metaphase to anaphase
transition, becomes active before cellular entry into mitosis as evidenced by
premature cyclin B1 polyubiquitination and degradation during S/G(2). Consistent 
with the notion that Tax activates APC(Cdc20) directly, Tax is found to
coimmunoprecipitate with Cdc20 and Cdc27/APC3. The APC(Cdc20) activity
prematurely activated by Tax remains sensitive to spindle checkpoint inhibition. 
Unscheduled activation of APC(Cdc20) by Tax provides an explanation for the
mitotic abnormalities in HTLV-I-infected cells and is likely to play an important
role in the development of adult T cell leukemia.
