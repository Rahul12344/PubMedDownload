The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encodes a gene product, Vpr, which causes 
infected cells to arrest or delay in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. The arrest
in G2 is characterized by low levels of Cyclin B1-p34Cdc2 activity and
corresponding inhibitory phosphorylation of p34Cdc2. We find that Vpr directly
inhibits the in vitro activity of a phosphatase, Cdc25C, which normally activates
Cyclin B1-p34Cdc2. Vpr binds to Cdc25C both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Vpr 
is also able to inhibit Cdc25C phosphatase activity in vitro although it binds to
a site on Cdc25C that is distinct from the catalytic site of the enzyme.
Expression of both a catalytically active mutant of Cdc25C that has reduced
binding to Vpr as well as a catalytically inactive mutant of Cdc25C that retains 
binding to Vpr is able to largely overcome Vpr-mediated G2 arrest. Finally,
depletion of Cdc25C from cells also renders them partially resistant to the
effects of Vpr.
