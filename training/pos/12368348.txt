PACT, a protein activator of PKR, can cause inhibition of cellular protein
synthesis and apoptosis. Here, we report that the Us11 protein of herpes simplex 
virus type 1 can block PKR activation by PACT both in vitro and in vivo. Although
Us11 can bind to both PKR and PACT, mutational analyses revealed that the binding
of Us11 to PKR, and not to PACT, was essential for its inhibitory action. Similar
analyses also revealed that the inhibitory effect was mediated by an interaction 
between the C-terminal half of Us11 and the N-terminal domain of PKR. The binding
of Us11 to PKR did not block the binding of PKR to PACT but prevented its
activation. Us11 is the first example of a viral protein that can inhibit the
action of PACT on PKR.
