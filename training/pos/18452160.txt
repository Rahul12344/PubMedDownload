We have a long-standing interest in a nuclear protease which appears to be
involved in carcinogenesis. We recently identified the protease as high
temperature requirement factor A 1 (HtrA1), also known as Prss11, which is member
of an oxidative stress-response family of proteases. HtrA1 has been classified as
a secreted protease involved in TGFbeta signaling, but recent work has shown
HtrA1 to be a tumor suppressor. Here we show that processed forms of HtrA1 are
found intracellularly and intranuclearly, and the active intranuclear form of
HtrA1 shows an approximately Mr 29,000. Further, expression of HPV E6/E7 proteins
is associated with a post-transcriptional up-regulation of HtrA1 (most notably
the nuclear form), and HtrA1 is found associated with both HPV E6 and E7
proteins.
