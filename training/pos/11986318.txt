Infection with high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) can lead to the development
of cervical carcinomas. This process critically depends on the virus-encoded E6
and E7 oncoproteins, which stimulate proliferation by manipulating the function
of a variety of host key regulatory proteins. Here we show that both viral
proteins dose-dependently interfere with the transcriptional activity of
NF-kappaB. A variety of experimental approaches revealed that a fraction of the
E7 proteins is found in association with the IkappaB kinase complex and
attenuates induced kinase activity of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) and
IKKbeta, thus resulting in impaired IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation.
Indirect immunofluorescence shows that E7 impairs TNFalpha-induced nuclear
translocation of NF-kappaB, thus preventing NF-kappaB from binding to its cognate
DNA. While E7 obviates IKK activation in the cytoplasm, the E6 protein reduces
NF-kappaB p65-dependent transcriptional activity within the nucleus. We suggest
that HPV oncogene-mediated suppression of NF-kappaB activity contributes to HPV
escape from the immune system.
