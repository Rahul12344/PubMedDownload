Latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is strongly associated with several
cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a tumor that is endemic in
several parts of the world. We have investigated the molecular basis for how EBV 
latent infection promotes the development of NPC. We show that the viral EBNA1
protein, previously known to be required to maintain the EBV episomes, also
causes the disruption of the cellular PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies
(or ND10s). This disruption occurs both in the context of a native latent
infection and when exogenously expressed in EBV-negative NPC cells and involves
loss of the PML proteins. We also show that EBNA1 is partially localized to PML
nuclear bodies in NPC cells and interacts with a specific PML isoform. PML
disruption by EBNA1 requires binding to the cellular ubiquitin specific protease,
USP7 or HAUSP, but is independent of p53. We further observed that p53
activation, DNA repair and apoptosis, all of which depend on PML nuclear bodies, 
were impaired by EBNA1 expression and that cells expressing EBNA1 were more
likely to survive after induction of DNA damage. The results point to an
important role for EBNA1 in the development of NPC, in which EBNA1-mediated
disruption of PML nuclear bodies promotes the survival of cells with DNA damage.
