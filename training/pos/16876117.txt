By use of the yeast two-hybrid system, hepatitis C virus (HCV) F protein was
found to interact with a cellular protein named prefoldin 2. The interaction was 
confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy as well as
coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Prefoldin 2 is a subunit of a hexameric
molecular chaperone complex, named prefoldin, which delivers nascent actin and
tubulin proteins to the eukaryotic cytosolic chaperonin for facilitated folding. 
Functional prefoldin spontaneously assembles from its six subunits (prefoldin
1-6). In the yeast three-hybrid system, it was found that expression of HCV F
protein impeded the interaction between prefoldin 1 and 2. By performing
immunofluorescence experiment and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis, it was
shown that expression of HCV F protein resulted in aberrant organization of
tubulin cytoskeleton. Since HCV replication requires intact microtubule and actin
polymerization, HCV F protein may serve as a modulator to prevent high level of
HCV replication and thus contributes to viral persistence in chronic HCV
infection.
