Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly dependent on cellular factors for its own
propagation. By employing tandem affinity purification method, we identified
pyruvate carboxylase (PC) as a cellular partner for NS5A protein. NS5A interacted
with PC through the N-terminal region of NS5A and the biotin carboxylase domain
of PC. PC expression was decreased in cells expressing NS5A and HCV-infected
cells. Promoter activity of PC was also decreased by NS5A protein. However, FAS
expression was increased in cells expressing NS5A and cell culture grown HCV
(HCVcc)-infected cells. Silencing of PC promoted fatty acid synthase (FAS)
expression level. These data suggest HCV may modulate PC via NS5A protein for its
own propagation.
