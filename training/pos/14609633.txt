We performed yeast two-hybrid screening of a human kidney cell cDNA library to
study the biological role of the hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP). We found
that Seoul virus (SEOV) and Hantaan virus (HTNV) NPs were associated with small
ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-1-interacting proteins PIAS1, PIASxbeta, HIPK2,
CHD3, and TTRAP, which interacted with the SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme (Ubc-9) and 
SUMO-1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Interactions between the HIPK2, CHD3, and
TTRAP proteins and SEOV NP were also shown in a mammalian two-hybrid assay.
However, there was no interaction between PIAS proteins and NP, which was
probably due to the inhibitory effect of PIAS on transcription in the mammalian
two-hybrid assay. Nevertheless, a co-expression experiment suggested the
existence of a PIAS-NP interaction in the cytoplasm. The region spanning amino
acids 100-125 of SEOV NP, which represents a critical region for NP-NP
polymerization, was found to be responsible for the interaction with
SUMO-1-related molecules in both the yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays. These
results add to the information on interactions of hantavirus NP and host cellular
proteins.
