Although the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) -140 and -180 have been shown
to serve as a receptor for rabies virus (RV), it was not known whether the other 
major isoform of NCAM, GPI-anchored NCAM-120 functions as RV receptor. In this
study, we have established HEp-2 cells stably expressing NCAM-120 or NCAM-140,
and their susceptibilities to RV infection were compared. The results
demonstrated that NCAM-120 served as virus attachment protein; however, the cells
expressing NCAM-120 did not support efficient RV replication. Furthermore, the
level of IFN-ss mRNA was apparently elevated in NCAM-120 expressing cells but not
in NCAM-140 expressing cells, suggesting that GPI-anchored NCAM-120 suppressed RV
replication via induction of IFN-ss even though NCAM-120 was able to promote
virus penetration into the cells.
