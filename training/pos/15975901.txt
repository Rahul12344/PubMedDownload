HIV-1-infected blood mononuclear cells form an integrin- and agrin-dependent
viral synapse to induce efficient HIV-1 transcytosis across epithelial cell
monolayer.

The heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin and adhesion molecules are key players in 
the formation of neuronal and immune synapses that evolved for efficient
communication at the sites of cell-cell contact. Transcytosis of infectious virus
across epithelial cells upon contact between HIV-1-infected cells and the mucosal
pole of the epithelial cells is one mechanism for HIV-1 entry at mucosal sites.
In contrast, transcytosis of cell-free HIV-1 is not efficient. A synapse between 
HIV-1-infected cells and the mucosal epithelial surface that resembles neuronal
and immune synapses is visualized by electron microscopy. We have termed this the
"viral synapse." Similarities of the viral synapse also extend to the functional 
level. HIV-1-infected cell-induced transcytosis depends on RGD-dependent
integrins and efficient cell-free virus transcytosis is inducible upon
RGD-dependent integrin cross-linking. Agrin appears differentially expressed at
the apical epithelial surface and acts as an HIV-1 attachment receptor. Envelope 
glycoprotein subunit gp41 binds specifically to agrin, reinforcing the
interaction of gp41 to its epithelial receptor galactosyl ceramide.
