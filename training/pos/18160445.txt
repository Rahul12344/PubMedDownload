The PDZ binding motif of human papillomavirus type 16 E6 induces PTPN13 loss,
which allows anchorage-independent growth and synergizes with ras for invasive
growth.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogene E6 has been shown to perform multiple
functions (p53 degradation, telomerase activation, etc.) that play a role in
oncogenic transformation. Beyond known E6 functions, an undefined mechanism that 
allows cellular invasion requires the E6 PDZ binding motif (PDZBM). Here, we show
that HPV type 16 (HPV16) E6 interacts with and induces loss of a protein tyrosine
phosphatase (PTPN13) in a PDZBM-dependent manner. PTPN13 loss induced either by
the presence of E6 or by a short hairpin RNA strategy allows for
anchorage-independent growth (AIG) and synergy with a known oncogene, Ras(v12),
resulting in invasive growth in vivo. Restoring PTPN13 expression reverses AIG in
cells lacking PTPN13. A genomic analysis of colorectal carcinoma has identified
an association between PTPN13 loss-of-function mutations and aberrant Ras
signaling. Our findings support this correlation and provide methods for further 
evaluation of the mechanisms by which PTPN13 loss/Ras expression leads to
invasive growth, the results of which will be important for treatment of
HPV-related and non-HPV cancer.
