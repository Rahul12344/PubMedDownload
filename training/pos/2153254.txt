Cystatin C is a human cysteine proteinase inhibitor present in extracellular
fluids. Cystatin C and a tripeptide derivative (Z-LVG-CHN2) that mimics its
proteinase-binding center, were tested for possible antiviral activity against
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV) and poliovirus type 1. Both recombinant
cystatin C and Z-LVG-CHN2 displayed strong inhibitory effects on HSV replication,
whereas no significant effect on poliovirus replication was seen. The molar
concentration of cystatin C that gave total inhibition of HSV replication was
lower than that of either Z-LVG-CHN2 or of acyclovir, the drug currently most
used against HSV infections. These results suggest that cysteine proteinase
inhibitors might play a physiological role as inhibitors of viral replication and
that such proteinase inhibitors, or peptide derivatives that mimic their
proteinase-binding centers, might be used as antiviral agents.
