Neurological disorders develop in most people infected with human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, the underlying mechanisms remain 
largely unknown. Here we report that binding of HIV-1 transactivator (Tat)
protein to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) promoted
efficient uptake of Tat into neurons. LRP-mediated uptake of Tat was followed by 
translocation to the neuronal nucleus. Furthermore, the binding of Tat to LRP
resulted in substantial inhibition of neuronal binding, uptake and degradation of
physiological ligands for LRP, including alpha2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein E4,
amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-protein. In a model of macaques
infected with a chimeric strain of simian-human immunodeficiency virus, increased
staining of amyloid precursor protein was associated with Tat expression in the
brains of simian-human immunodeficiency virus-infected macaques with
encephalitis. These results indicate that HIV-1 Tat may mediate HIV-1-induced
neuropathology through a pathway involving disruption of the metabolic balance of
LRP ligands and direct activation of neuronal genes.
