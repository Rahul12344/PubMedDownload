BACKGROUND: Despite the large amount of data available on the molecular
mechanisms that regulate HIV-1 transcription, crucial information is still
lacking about the interplay between chromatin conformation and the events that
regulate initiation and elongation of viral transcription. During transcriptional
activation, histone acetyltransferases and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling
complexes cooperate with histone chaperones in altering chromatin structure. In
particular, human Nucleosome Assembly Protein-1 (hNAP-1) is known to act as a
histone chaperone that shuttles histones H2A/H2B into the nucleus, assembles
nucleosomes and promotes chromatin fluidity, thereby affecting transcription of
several cellular genes.
RESULTS: Using a proteomic screening, we identified hNAP-1 as a novel cellular
protein interacting with HIV-1 Tat. We observed that Tat specifically binds
hNAP1, but not other members of the same family of factors. Binding between the
two proteins required the integrity of the basic domain of Tat and of two
separable domains of hNAP-1 (aa 162-290 and 290-391). Overexpression of hNAP-1
significantly enhanced Tat-mediated activation of the LTR. Conversely, silencing 
of the protein decreased viral promoter activity. To explore the effects of
hNAP-1 on viral infection, a reporter HIV-1 virus was used to infect cells in
which hNAP-1 had been either overexpressed or knocked-down. Consistent with the
gene expression results, these two treatments were found to increase and inhibit 
viral infection, respectively. Finally, we also observed that the overexpression 
of p300, a known co-activator of both Tat and hNAP-1, enhanced hNAP-1-mediated
transcriptional activation as well as its interaction with Tat.
CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that HIV-1 Tat binds the histone chaperone hNAP-1
both in vitro and in vivo and shows that this interaction participates in the
regulation of Tat-mediated activation of viral gene expression.
