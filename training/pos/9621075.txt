Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters target cells by sequential
binding to CD4 and specific seven-transmembrane-segment (7TMS) coreceptors.
Viruses use the chemokine receptor CCR5 as a coreceptor in the early,
asymptomatic stages of HIV-1 infection but can adapt to the use of other
receptors such as CXCR4 and CCR3 as the infection proceeds. Here we identify one 
such coreceptor, Apj, which supported the efficient entry of several primary
T-cell-line tropic (T-tropic) and dualtropic HIV-1 isolates and the simian
immunodeficiency virus SIVmac316. Another 7TMS protein, CCR9, supported the less 
efficient entry of one primary T-tropic isolate. mRNAs for both receptors were
present in phytohemagglutinin- and interleukin-2-activated peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. Apj and CCR9 share with other coreceptors for HIV-1 and SIV an
N-terminal region rich in aromatic and acidic residues. These results highlight
properties common to 7TMS proteins that can function as HIV-1 coreceptors, and
they may contribute to an understanding of viral evolution in infected
individuals.
