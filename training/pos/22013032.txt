Many viruses, including members of several poxvirus genera, encode inhibitors
that block apoptosis by simultaneously binding the proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins
Bak and Bax. The Orthopoxvirus vaccinia virus encodes the Bcl-2-like F1 protein, 
which sequesters Bak but not Bax. However, N1, a potent virulence factor, is
reported to be antiapoptotic and to interact with Bax. Here we investigated
whether vaccinia virus inhibits Bak/Bax-dependent apoptosis via the cooperative
action of F1 and N1. We found that Western Reserve (WR) and ΔN1L viruses
inhibited drug- and infection-induced apoptosis equally. Meanwhile, infections
with ΔF1L or ΔN1L/F1L virus resulted in similar levels of Bax activation and
apoptosis. Outside the context of infection, N1 did not block drug- or
Bax-induced cell death or interact with Bax. In addition to F1 and N1, vaccinia
virus encodes further structural homologs of Bcl-2 proteins that are conserved in
orthopoxviruses, including A46, A52, B14, C1, C6, C16/B22, K7, and N2. However,
we found that these do not associate with Bax or inhibit drug-induced cell death.
Based on our findings that N1 is not an antiapoptotic protein, we propose that
the F1 orthologs represent the only orthopoxvirus Bcl-2 homolog to directly
inhibit the Bak/Bax checkpoint.
