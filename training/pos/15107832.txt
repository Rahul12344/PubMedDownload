Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) mediates diverse cellular responses to genotoxic
stress, regulating the network of genome-surveillance pathways that coordinate
cell cycle progression with DNA repair. Chk1 is essential for mammalian
development and viability, and has been shown to be important for both S and G(2)
checkpoints. We now present evidence that the HTLV-1 Tax protein interacts
directly with Chk1 and impairs its kinase activities in vitro and in vivo. The
direct and physical interaction of Chk1 and Tax was observed in HTLV-1-infected T
cells (C81, HuT 102 and MT-2) and transfected fibroblasts (293 T) by
coimmunoprecipitation and by in vitro GST pull-down assays. Interestingly, Tax
inhibited the kinase activity of Chk1 protein in in vitro and in vivo kinase
assays. Consistent with these results, Tax inhibited the
phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Cdc25A and G(2) arrest in response to
gamma-irradiation (IR) in a dose-dependent manner in vivo. The G(2) arrest did
not require Chk2 or p53. These studies provide the first example of a viral
transforming protein targeting Chk1 and provide important insights into
checkpoint pathway regulation.
