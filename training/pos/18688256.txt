Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1-like ligand for the ST2 receptor that
stimulates the production of Th2-associated cytokines. Recently, we showed that
IL-33 is a chromatin-associated factor in the nucleus of endothelial cells in
vivo. Here, we report the identification of a short IL-33 chromatin-binding
peptide that shares striking similarities with a motif found in Kaposi sarcoma
herpesvirus LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen), which is responsible for
the attachment of viral genomes to mitotic chromosomes. Similar to LANA, the
IL-33 peptide docks into the acidic pocket formed by the H2A-H2B dimer at the
nucleosomal surface and regulates chromatin compaction by promoting
nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Taken together, our data provide important
new insights into the nuclear roles of IL-33, and show a unique example of
molecular mimicry of a chromatin-associated cytokine by a DNA tumour virus. In
addition, the data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration
of the existence of non-histone cellular factors that bind to the acidic pocket
of the nucleosome.
