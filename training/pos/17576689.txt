Basal transcription of the HIV LTR is highly repressed and requires Tat to
recruit the positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb, which functions to 
promote the transition of RNA polymerase II from abortive to productive
elongation. P-TEFb is found in two forms in cells, a free, active form and a
large, inactive complex that also contains 7SK RNA and HEXIM1 or HEXIM2. Here we 
show that HIV infection of cells led to the release of P-TEFb from the large
form. Consistent with Tat being the cause of this effect, transfection of a
FLAG-tagged Tat in 293T cells caused a dramatic shift of P-TEFb out of the large 
form to a smaller form containing Tat. In vitro, Tat competed with HEXIM1 for
binding to 7SK, blocked the formation of the P-TEFb-HEXIM1-7SK complex, and
caused the release P-TEFb from a pre-formed P-TEFb-HEXIM1-7SK complex. These
findings indicate that Tat can acquire P-TEFb from the large form. In addition,
we found that HEXIM1 binds tightly to the HIV 5' UTR containing TAR and recruits 
and inhibits P-TEFb activity. This suggests that in the absence of Tat, HEXIM1
may bind to TAR and repress transcription elongation of the HIV LTR.
