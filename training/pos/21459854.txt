Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection leads to changes in cellular
gene expression, which in turn tend to modulate viral gene expression and
replication. Cellular heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced upon heat shock, UV 
irradiation and microbial or viral infections. We have reported earlier
Nef-dependent induction of HSP40 leading to increased HIV-1 gene expression;
however, the mechanism of induction remained to be elucidated. As expression of
HSPs is regulated by heat shock factors (HSFs), we have now studied the role of
HSF1 not only in Nef-dependent HSP40 induction but also in HIV-1 gene expression.
Our results show that HSF1 is also induced during HIV-1 infection and it
positively regulates HIV-1 gene expression by two distinct pathways. First, along
with Nef it activates HSP40 promoter which in turn leads to increased HIV-1 gene 
expression. Second, HSF1 directly interacts with newly identified HSF1 binding
sequence on HIV-1 LTR promoter and induces viral gene expression and replication.
Thus, the present work not only identifies a molecular basis for HSF1-mediated
enhancement of viral replication but also provides another example of how HIV-1
uses host cell machinery for its successful replication in the host.
