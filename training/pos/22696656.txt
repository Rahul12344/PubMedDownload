Influenza virus has evolved replication strategies that hijack host cell
pathways. To uncover interactions between viral macromolecules and host proteins,
we applied a phage display strategy. A library of human cDNA expression products 
displayed on filamentous phages was submitted to affinity selection for influenza
viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). High-mobility-group box (HMGB) proteins were
found to bind to the nucleoprotein (NP) component of vRNPs. HMGB1 and HMGB2 bind 
directly to the purified NP in the absence of viral RNA, and the HMG box A domain
is sufficient to bind the NP. We show that HMGB1 associates with the viral NP in 
the nuclei of infected cells, promotes viral growth, and enhances the activity of
the viral polymerase. The presence of a functional HMGB1 DNA-binding site is
required to enhance influenza virus replication. Glycyrrhizin, which reduces
HMGB1 binding to DNA, inhibits influenza virus polymerase activity. Our data show
that the HMGB1 protein can play a significant role in intranuclear replication of
influenza viruses, thus extending previous findings on the bornavirus and on a
number of DNA viruses.
