Reverse transcription of retroviral RNA genomes produce a double-stranded linear 
cDNA molecule. A host degradation system prevents a majority of the cDNA
molecules from completing the obligatory genomic integration necessary for
pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the human TFIIH complex proteins XPB (ERCC3)
and XPD (ERCC2) play a principal role in the degradation of retroviral cDNA. DNA 
repair-deficient XPB and XPD mutant cell lines exhibited an increase in
transduction efficiency by both HIV- and Moloney murine leukemia virus-based
retroviral vectors. Replicating Moloney murine leukemia virus viral production
was greater in XPB or XPD mutant cells but not XPA mutant cells. Quantitative PCR
showed an increase in total cDNA molecules, integrated provirus, and 2LTR circles
in XPB and XPD mutant cells. In the presence of a reverse transcription
inhibitor, the HIV cDNA appeared more stable in mutant XPB or XPD cells. These
studies implicate the nuclear DNA repair proteins XPB and XPD in a cellular
defense against retroviral infection.
