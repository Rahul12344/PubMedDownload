Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses the immediate-early protein Rta to activate
the transcription of EBV lytic genes and the lytic cycle. We show that RanBPM
acts as a binding partner of Rta in yeast two-hybrid analysis. The binding was
confirmed by glutathione-S-transferase pull-down assay. A coimmunoprecipitation
experiment and confocal microscopy revealed that RanBPM and Rta interact in vivo 
and colocalize in the nucleus. The interaction appears to involve the SPRY domain
in RanBPM and the region between amino acid residues 416 to 476 in Rta. The
interaction promotes the transactivation activity of Rta in activating the
transcription of BMLF1 and p21 in transient transfection assays. Additionally,
RanBPM interacts with SUMO-E2 (Ubc9) to promote sumoylation of Rta by SUMO-1.
This fact explains why the expression of RanBPM enhances the transactivation
activity of Rta. Taken together, the present results indicate a new role of
RanBPM in regulating a viral protein that is critical to EBV lytic activation.
