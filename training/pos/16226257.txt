The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is
an important issue for treatment and prevention of SARS. Recently, SARS-CoV
3CL(pro) protease has been implied to be possible relevance to SARS-CoV
pathogenesis. In this study, we intended to identify potential
3CL(pro)-interacting cellular protein(s) using the phage-displayed human lung
cDNA library. The vacuolar-H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) G1 subunit that contained a
3CL(pro) cleavage site-like motif was identified as a 3CL(pro)-interacting
protein, as confirmed using the co-immunoprecipitation assay and the relative
affinity assay. In addition, our result also demonstrated the cleavage of the
V-ATPase G1 fusion protein and the immunoprecipitation of cellular V-ATPase G1 by
the 3CL(pro). Moreover, loading cells with SNARF-1 pH-sensitive dye showed that
the intracellular pH in 3CL(pro)-expressing cells was significantly lower as
compared to mock cells.
