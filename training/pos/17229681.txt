Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. NS5b is an
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that polymerizes the newly synthesized RNA. HCV
likely uses host proteins for its replication, similar to other RNA viruses. To
identify the cellular factors involved in HCV replication, we searched for
cellular proteins that interact with the NS5b protein. HnRNP A1 and septin 6
proteins were identified by coimmunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid screening,
respectively. Interestingly, septin 6 protein also interacts with hnRNP A1.
Moreover, hnRNP A1 interacts with the 5'-nontranslated region (5' NTR) and the 3'
NTR of HCV RNA containing the cis-acting elements required for replication.
Knockdown of hnRNP A1 and overexpression of C-terminally truncated hnRNP A1
reduced HCV replication. In addition, knockdown of septin 6 and overexpression of
N-terminally truncated septin 6 inhibited HCV replication. These results indicate
that the host proteins hnRNP A1 and septin 6 play important roles in the
replication of HCV through RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions.
