Feline calicivirus (FCV) is responsible for an acute upper respiratory tract
disease in cats. The FCV capsid protein is synthesized as a precursor (76 kDa)
that is post-translationally processed into the mature 62 kDa capsid protein by
removal of the N-terminal 124 amino acids. Our previous studies have also
detected a 40 kDa protein, related to the FCV capsid protein, produced during
infection. Here we demonstrate that cleavage of the FCV capsid protein, during
infection of cells in culture, was prevented by caspase inhibitors. In addition, 
caspase-2, -3 and -7 were activated during FCV infection, as shown by pro-form
processing, an increase in
N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin cleavage activity and 
in situ poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Caspase activation coincided with
the induction of apoptosis and capsid cleavage to the 40 kDa fragment. An in
vitro cleavage assay, using recombinant human caspases and in vitro-derived FCV
capsid protein, revealed that caspase-2, and to a lesser extent caspase-6,
cleaved the capsid protein to generate a 40 kDa fragment. Taken together, these
results suggest that FCV triggers apoptosis within infected cells and that
caspase-induced capsid cleavage occurs concomitantly with apoptosis. The possible
role of capsid cleavage in the pathogenesis of FCV infection is discussed.
