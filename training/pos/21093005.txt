To identify the host factors implicated in the regulation of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) genome replication, we performed comparative proteome analyses of HCV
replication complex (RC)-rich membrane fractions prepared from cells harboring
genome-length bicistronic HCV RNA at the exponential and stationary growth
phases. We found that the eukaryotic chaperonin T-complex polypeptide 1
(TCP1)-ring complex/chaperonin-containing TCP1 (TRiC/CCT) plays a role in the
replication possibly through an interaction between subunit CCT5 and the viral
RNA polymerase NS5B. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCT5 suppressed RNA replication 
and production of the infectious virus. Gain-of-function activity was shown
following co-transfection with whole eight TRiC/CCT subunits. HCV RNA synthesis
was inhibited by an anti-CCT5 antibody in a cell-free assay. These suggest that
recruitment of the chaperonin by the viral nonstructural proteins to the RC,
which potentially facilitate folding of the RC component(s) into the mature
active form, may be important for efficient replication of the HCV genome.
