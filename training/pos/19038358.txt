Reduction of intramolecular disulfides in the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 occurs
after its binding to the CD4 receptor. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)
catalyzes the disulfide reduction in vitro and inhibition of this enzyme blocks
viral entry. PDI belongs to the thioredoxin protein superfamily that also
includes human glutaredoxin-1 (Grx1). Grx1 is secreted from cells and the protein
has also been found within the HIV-1 virion. We show that Grx1 efficiently
catalyzes gp120, and CD4 disulfide reduction in vitro, even at low plasma levels 
of glutathione. Grx1 catalyzes the reduction of two disulfide bridges in gp120 in
a similar manner as PDI. Purified anti-Grx1 antibodies were shown to inhibit the 
Grx1 activity in vitro and block HIV-1 replication in cultured peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. Also, the polyanion PRO2000, that was previously shown to
prevent HIV entry, inhibits the Grx1- and PDI-dependent reduction of gp120
disulfides. Our findings suggest that Grx1 activity is important for HIV-1 entry 
and that Grx1 and the gp120 intramolecular disulfides are novel pharmacological
targets for rational drug development.
