The human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Tat protein was previously reported to
compete the association of PA28 regulator with the alpha rings of the 20S
proteasome and to inhibit its peptidase activity. However, the distinct
interaction sites within the proteasome complex remained to be determined. Here
we show that HIV-1 Tat binds to alpha4 and alpha7, six beta subunits of the
constitutive 20S proteasome and the interferon-gamma-inducible subunits beta2i
and beta5i. A Tat-proteasome interaction can also be demonstrated in vivo and
leads to inhibition of proteasomal activity. This indicates that Tat can modulate
or interfere with cellular proteasome function by specific interaction with
distinct proteasomal subunits.
