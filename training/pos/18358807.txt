Glycoprotein B (gB) is one of the essential components for infection by herpes
simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Although several cellular receptors that associate with 
glycoprotein D (gD), such as herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) and Nectin-1,
have been identified, specific molecules that mediate HSV-1 infection by
associating with gB have not been elucidated. Here, we found that paired
immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor (PILR) alpha associates with gB, and cells
transduced with PILRalpha become susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Furthermore,
HSV-1 infection of human primary cells expressing both HVEM and PILRalpha was
blocked by either anti-PILRalpha or anti-HVEM antibody. Our results demonstrate
that cellular receptors for both gB and gD are required for HSV-1 infection and
that PILRalpha plays an important role in HSV-1 infection as a coreceptor that
associates with gB. These findings uncover a crucial aspect of the mechanism
underlying HSV-1 infection.
