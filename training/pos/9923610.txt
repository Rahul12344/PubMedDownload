The nef gene of human and simian immunodeficiency virus is a key factor in
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome pathogenesis and virus replication. Several
Nef-induced phenomena, including the down-regulation of CD4 molecule, have been
previously reported. In this study, we have identified and cloned a novel
cellular protein Naf1 (Nef-associated factor 1), which associated with Nef in the
yeast two-hybrid system and pull-down assay. The Naf1 gene generates two isoforms
(Naf1alpha and beta) containing four coiled-coil structures. The Naf1 mRNA is
ubiquitously expressed in human tissues with strong expression in peripheral
blood lymphocytes and spleen. Naf1 overexpression increased cell surface CD4
expression. Nef suppressed this Naf1-induced augmentation of CD4 expression,
providing a novel mode of Nef action in CD4 down-regulation.
