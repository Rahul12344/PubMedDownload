Several picornaviruses shut down host cellular protein synthesis by proteolytic
cleavage of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4GI and eIF4GII isoforms.
Viral RNA translation is maintained by a cap-independent mechanism. Here, we
identify the human rhinovirus 2 2A(pro) cleavage site in eIF4GII in vitro as
PLLNV(699)*GSR; this sequence lies seven amino acids C-terminal to the cleavage
site previously identified in eIF4GI (LSTR681*GPP).
