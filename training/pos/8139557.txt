The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) origin of DNA replication, oriS, contains
an AT-rich region and three highly homologous sequences, sites I, II, and III,
identified as binding sites for the HSV-1 origin-binding protein (OBP). In the
present study, interactions between specific oriS DNA sequences and proteins in
uninfected cell extracts were characterized. The formation of one predominant
protein-DNA complex, M, was demonstrated in gel shift assays following incubation
of uninfected cell extracts with site I DNA. The cellular protein(s) that
comprises complex M has been designated origin factor I (OF-I). The OF-I binding 
site was shown to partially overlap the OBP binding site within site I. Complexes
with mobilities indistinguishable from that of complex M also formed with site II
and III DNAs in gel shift assays. oriS-containing plasmid DNA mutated in the OF-I
binding site exhibited reduced replication efficiency in transient assays,
demonstrating a role for this site in oriS function. The OF-I binding site is
highly homologous to binding sites for the cellular CCAAT DNA-binding proteins.
The binding site for the CCAAT protein CP2 was found to compete for OF-I binding 
to site I DNA. These studies support a model involving the participation of
cellular proteins in the initiation of HSV-1 DNA synthesis at oriS.
