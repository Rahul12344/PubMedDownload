RNA recognition receptors are important for detection of and response to viral
infections. RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic DEX(D/H) helicase proteins that can
induce signaling in response to RNA ligands, including those from viral
infections. LGP2, a homolog of RIG-I and MDA5 without the caspase recruitment
domain required for signaling, plays an important role in modulating signaling by
MDA5 and RIG-I, presumably through heterocomplex formation and/or by serving as a
sink for RNAs. Here we demonstrate that LGP2 can be coexpressed with RIG-I to
inhibit activation of the NF-kappaB reporter expression and that LGP2 protein
produced in insect cells can bind both single- and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA),
with higher affinity and cooperativity for dsRNA. Electron microscopy and image
reconstruction were used to determine the shape of the LGP2 monomer in the
absence of dsRNA and of the dimer complexed to a 27-bp dsRNA. LGP2 has striking
structural similarity to the helicase domain of the superfamily 2 DNA helicase,
Hef.
