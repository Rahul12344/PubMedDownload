Silencing of both beta-TrCP1 and HOS (beta-TrCP2) is required to suppress human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu-mediated CD4 down-modulation.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpu protein interacts with CD4
within the endoplasmic reticula of infected cells and targets CD4 for degradation
through interaction with beta-TrCP1. Mammals possess a homologue of beta-TrCP1,
HOS, which is also named beta-TrCP2. We show by coimmunoprecipitation experiments
that beta-TrCP2 binds Vpu and is able to induce CD4 down-modulation as
efficiently as beta-TrCP1. In two different cell lines, HeLa CD4+ and Jurkat,
Vpu-mediated CD4 down-modulation could not be reversed through the individual
silencing of endogenous beta-TrCP1 or beta-TrCP2 but instead required the two
genes to be silenced simultaneously.
