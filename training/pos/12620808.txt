We have previously shown that the L1 major capsid protein of low-risk HPV11 binds
to the Kap alpha2 adapter and enters the nucleus via a Kap alpha2beta1-mediated
pathway. In this study, we discovered that HPV11 L1 capsomeres bind to Kap beta2 
import receptor, known to mediate nuclear import of hnRNP A1 via interaction with
its nuclear localization signal termed M9. Significantly, binding of HPV11 L1
capsomeres to Kap beta2 inhibited the nuclear import of Kap beta2, and its
specific M9-containing cargo. Interestingly, HPV11 L1 capsomeres also interacted 
with Kap beta3 import receptor and inhibited Kap beta3 nuclear import. Moreover, 
the L1 capsomeres of high-risk HPV-16 shared these activities. These data suggest
that HPV L1 major capsid proteins interact with Kap beta2 and Kap beta3, and they
may inhibit the Kap beta2- and Kap beta3-mediated nuclear import pathways during 
the productive phase of the viral life cycle when the virions are assembled and
released.
