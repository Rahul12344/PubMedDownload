Herpesviral infection of endothelial cells (ECs) induces arterial injury. We now 
demonstrate that such infection promoted enhanced monocyte-endothelial adhesion. 
Enhanced adhesion was blocked by monoclonal antibodies to the viral-encoded cell 
surface glycoprotein gC but not by antibodies to gD or gE. Adhesion was also
blocked by treating ECs with specific thrombin inhibitors or by growing cells in 
prothrombin-depleted serum. We found that gC bound and promoted activation of
factor X on infected ECs, thereby contributing to thrombin generation. Factor X
also bound to transfected L cells that were induced to express gC. Cross-linking 
and immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated factor X-gC complex formation on the
surface of these cells. We suggest that gC-dependent thrombin generation by
herpes-infected endothelium may be an important mediator of vascular pathology
during viral infection.
