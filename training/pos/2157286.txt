Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is a DNA tumor virus that is associated
with human anogenital cancers and encodes two transforming proteins, E6 and E7.
The E7 protein has been shown to bind to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene
product, pRB. This study shows that the E6 protein of HPV-16 is capable of
binding to the cellular p53 protein. The ability of the E6 proteins from
different human papillomaviruses to form complexes with p53 was assayed and found
to correlate with the in vivo clinical behavior and the in vitro transforming
activity of these different papillomaviruses. The wild-type p53 protein has tumor
suppressor properties and has also been found in association with large T antigen
and the E1B 55-kilodalton protein in cells transformed by SV40 and by adenovirus 
type 5, respectively, providing further evidence that the human papillomaviruses,
the adenoviruses, and SV40 may effect similar cellular pathways in
transformation.
