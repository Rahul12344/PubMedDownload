Influenza A viruses may cross species barriers and transmit to humans with the
potential to cause pandemics. Interplay of human- (PB2 627K) and avian-like (PB2 
627E) influenza polymerase complexes with unknown host factors have been
postulated to play a key role in interspecies transmission. Here, we have
identified human importin-α isoforms (α1 and α7) as positive regulators of human-
but not avian-like polymerase activity. Human-like polymerase activity correlated
with efficient recruitment of α1 and α7 to viral ribonucleoprotein complexes
(vRNPs) without affecting subcellular localization. We also observed that
human-like influenza virus growth was impaired in α1 and α7 downregulated human
lung cells. Mice lacking α7 were less susceptible to human- but not avian-like
influenza virus infection. Thus, α1 and α7 are positive regulators of human-like 
polymerase activity and pathogenicity beyond their role in nuclear transport.
