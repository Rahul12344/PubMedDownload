BACKGROUND: The HIV Nef protein downregulates CD4 through sequential connection
with clathrin-coated pits and the COP1 coatomer, resulting in accelerated
endocytosis and lysosomal targeting.
RESULTS: Here we report that the small GTPase ARF1 controls the Nef-induced,
COP-mediated late-endosomal targeting of CD4. We find that Nef binds ARF1
directly and can recruit the GTPase onto endosomal membranes. Furthermore, a
complex comprising Nef, ARF1, and betaCOP can be immunoprecipitated from cells
expressing the viral protein. Residues in a C-terminal loop of the viral protein 
facilitate both these interactions and the targeting of Nef and CD4 to acidic
late endosomes, whereas other residues primarily involved in mediating CD4
endocytosis are dispensable for this process. Finally, a dominant-negative ARF1
mutant blocks the migration of the Nef-CD4 complex to lysosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a model in which ARF1 is the immediate
downstream partner of Nef for CD4 lysosomal targeting.
