E7 is the major transforming protein of human papillomavirus (HPV), which is
implicated in the development of cervical cancer. The transforming activity of E7
has been attributed in part to its interaction with the retinoblastoma (Rb)
tumour suppressor; however, the Rb interaction alone is not sufficient for
transformation by E7. In a screen for cellular targets of HPV E7, we identified
the Ski interacting protein, Skip, as a new interacting partner of E7. We show
that HPV-16 E7 associates with Skip via sequences in its carboxy terminal region,
and the evolutionarily conserved proline rich sequences (PRS) of the SNW domain
of Skip. E7 functionally targets Skip in vivo and inhibits its transcriptional
activation activity. Two transformation defective mutants of E7 were identified
that failed both to bind Skip and to inhibit its transcriptional activity. These 
results suggest that inhibition of Skip function may contribute to cell
transformation by HPV-16 E7.
