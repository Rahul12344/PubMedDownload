Ross River (RR) virus is an alphavirus endemic to Australia and New Guinea and is
the aetiological agent of epidemic polyarthritis or RR virus disease. Here we
provide evidence that RR virus uses the collagen-binding alpha1beta1 integrin as 
a cellular receptor. Infection could be inhibited by collagen IV and antibodies
specific for the beta1 and alpha1 integrin proteins, and fibroblasts from
alpha1-integrin-/- mice were less efficiently infected than wild-type
fibroblasts. Soluble alpha1beta1 integrin bound immobilized RR virus, and
peptides representing the alpha1beta1 integrin binding-site on collagen IV
inhibited virus binding to cells. We speculate that two highly conserved regions 
within the cell-receptor binding domain of E2 mimic collagen and provide access
to cellular collagen-binding receptors.
