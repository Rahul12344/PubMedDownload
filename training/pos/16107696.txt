Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is able to establish a latent
infection during which the integrated provirus remains transcriptionally silent. 
In response to specific stimuli, the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is highly
activated, enhancing both transcriptional initiation and elongation. Here, we
have identified a specific binding sequence of the nuclear NF-kappaB-repressing
factor (NRF) within the HIV-1 LTR. The aim of this work was to define the role of
NRF in regulating the LTR. Our data show that the endogenous NRF is required for 
transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 LTR in stimulated cells. In unstimulated 
cells, however, NRF inhibits HIV-1 LTR activity at the level of transcription
elongation. Binding of NRF to the LTR in unstimulated cells prevents recruitment 
of elongation factor DRB sensitivity-inducing factor and formation of processive 
elongation complexes by hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. Our data suggest
that NRF interrupts the regulatory coupling of LTR binding factors and
transcription elongation events. This inhibitory mechanism might contribute to
transcriptional quiescence of integrated HIV-1 provirus.
