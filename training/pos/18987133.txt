Upon viral infection, the major defense mounted by the host immune system is
activation of the interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral pathway, which is mediated 
by IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). In order to complete their life cycle, viruses 
must modulate host IFN-mediated immune responses. Despite its association with
significant human health problems, activities of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a
human tumor-inducing herpesvirus, to evade host IFN-mediated innate immunity have
not been well characterized. To search for EBV genes that block IFN signal
transduction, we carried out a screening of EBV open reading frames for their
abilities to block IFN-alpha/beta-mediated luciferase expression upon Sendai
virus infection. This screening demonstrates that EBV LF2 tegument protein
specifically interacts with the central inhibitory association domain of IRF7,
and this interaction leads to inhibition of the dimerization of IRF7, which
suppresses IFN-alpha production and IFN-mediated immunity. This demonstrates a
novel immune evasion mechanism of EBV LF2 in blocking cellular IRF7-mediated
innate immunity.
