Several large DNA viruses encode Bcl-2 protein homologues involved in the
regulation of the cellular apoptosis cascade. This regulation often involves the 
interaction of these viral proteins with diverse cellular Bcl-2 family members.
We have identified the specific interactions of A179L, an African swine fever
virus (ASFV) Bcl-2 homologue, with the active forms of the porcine BH3-only Bid
protein (truncated Bid p13 and p15). Transient expression of ASFV A179L gene in
Vero cells prevented apoptosis induced by these active forms of Bid protein.
Interestingly, A179L protein was able to interact, also with the main core Bcl-2 
proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, and with several BH3-only proteins with
selective binding restrictions for full length Bid and Noxa. These results
suggest a fine regulation for A179L action in the suppression of apoptosis in
infected cells which is essential for efficient virus replication.
