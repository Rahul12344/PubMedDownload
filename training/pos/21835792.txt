Autophagy has been shown to facilitate replication or production of hepatitis C
virus (HCV); nevertheless, how HCV induces autophagy remains unclear. Here, we
demonstrate that HCV nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) alone can induce autophagy
signaling; amino acid residues 1 to 190 of NS4B are sufficient for this
induction. Further studies showed that the phosphorylation levels of S6K and
4E-BP1 were not altered, suggesting that the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway and
mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway did not contribute to NS4B- or HCV-induced autophagy.
Inhibition of Rab5 function by silencing Rab5 or overexpressing dominant-negative
Rab5 mutant (S34N) resulted in significant reduction of NS4B- or HCV-induced
autophagic vesicle formation. Moreover, the autophagy induction was impaired by
inhibition of class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) Vps34 function.
Finally, the coimmunoprecipitation assay indicated that NS4B formed a complex
with Rab5 and Vps34, supporting the notion that Rab5 and Vps34 are involved in
NS4B-induced autophagy. Taken together, these results not only reveal a novel
role of NS4B in autophagy but also offer a clue to the mechanism of HCV-induced
autophagy.
