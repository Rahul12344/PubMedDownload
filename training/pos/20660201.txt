A serine/threonine (S/T) kinase encoded by the US3 gene of herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) is conserved in varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and pseudorabies
virus (PRV). Expression of US3 kinase in cells transformed with US3 expression
plasmids or infected with each virus results in hyperphosphorylation of histone
deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Mapping studies revealed that each US3 kinase
phosphorylates HDAC2 at the same unique conserved Ser residue in its C terminus. 
HDAC2 was also hyperphosphorylated in cells infected with PRV lacking US3 kinase,
indicating that hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2 by PRV occurs in a US3-independent 
manner. Specific chemical inhibition of class I HDAC activity increases the
plaquing efficiency of VZV and PRV lacking US3 or its enzymatic activity, whereas
only minimal effects are observed with wild-type viruses, suggesting that VZV and
PRV US3 kinase activities target HDACs to reduce viral genome silencing and allow
efficient viral replication. However, no effect was observed for wild-type or US3
null HSV-1. Thus, we have demonstrated that while HDAC2 is a conserved target of 
alphaherpesvirus US3 kinases, the functional significance of these events is
virus specific.
