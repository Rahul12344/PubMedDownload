Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes 3 genes that are
homologous to cellular chemokines. vMIP-III, the product of open reading frame
K4.1, is the most distantly related to human chemokines and has yet to be
characterized. We have examined the interaction of vMIP-III with chemokine
receptors, its expression in KS lesions, and its in ovo angiogenic properties. We
show expression of vMIP-III in KS lesions and demonstrate the stimulation of
angiogenesis by this chemokine, like vMIP-I and vMIP-II, in the chick
chorioallantoic membrane assay. vMIP-III does not block human immunodeficiency
virus entry through the coreceptors CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4. However, vMIP-III is an
agonist for the cellular chemokine receptor CCR4. CCR4 is expressed by TH2-type T
cells. Consistent with this, vMIP-III preferentially chemoattracts this cell
type. Because of these biologic properties and because it is expressed in KS
lesions, vMIP-III may play an important role in the pathobiology of KS. (Blood.
