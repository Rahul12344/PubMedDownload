Autophagy is an important cellular process by which ATG5 initiates the formation 
of double membrane vesicles (DMVs). Upon infection, DMVs have been shown to
harbor the replicase complex of positive-strand RNA viruses such as MHV,
poliovirus, and equine arteritis virus. Recently, it has been shown that
autophagy proteins are proviral factors that favor initiation of hepatitis C
virus (HCV) infection. Here, we identified ATG5 as an interacting protein for the
HCV NS5B. ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed by co-IP and metabolic labeling
studies. Furthermore, ATG5 protein colocalizes with NS4B, a constituent of the
membranous web. Importantly, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a strong
colocalization of ATG5 and NS5B within perinuclear regions of infected cells at 2
days postinfection. However, colocalization was completely lacking at 5DPI,
suggesting that HCV utilizes ATG5 as a proviral factor during the onset of viral 
infection. Finally, inhibition of autophagy through ATG5 silencing blocks HCV
replication.
