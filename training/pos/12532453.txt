AIM: To investigate the interaction between hepatitis C virus core protein and
translin protein and its role in the pathogenensis of hepatocellular carcinoma
and lymphoma.
METHODS: With the components of the yeast two hybrid system 3, "bait" plasmids of
HCV core the gene was constructed. After proving that hepatitis C virus core
protein could be firmly expressed in AH109 yeast strains, yeast two- hybrid
screening was performed by mating AH109 with Y187 that transformed with liver
cDNA library plasmids-pACT2 and then plated on quadruple dropout (QDO) medium and
then assayed for alpha-gal activity. Sequencing analysis of the genes of library 
plasmids in yeast colonies that could grow on QDO with alpha-gal activity was
performed. The interaction between HCV core protein and the protein we obtained
from positive colony was further confirmed by repeating yeast two - hybrid
analysis and coimmunoprecipitation in vitro.
RESULTS: A gene from a positive colony was the gene of translin, a recombination 
hotspot binding protein. The interaction between HCV core protein and translin
protein could be proved not only in yeast, but also in vitro.
CONCLUSION: The core protein of HCV can interact with translin protein. This can 
partly explain the molecular mechanism for hepatocellular carcinoma and lymphoma 
caused by HCV.
