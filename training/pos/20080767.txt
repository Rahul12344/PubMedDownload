Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) are prevalent
neurotropic herpesviruses that cause various nervous system diseases. Similar to 
other enveloped viruses, membrane fusion is an essential process for viral entry.
Therefore, identification of host molecules that mediate membrane fusion is
important to understand the mechanism of viral infection. Here, we demonstrate
that myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), mainly distributed in neural tissues, 
associates with VZV glycoprotein B (gB) and promotes cell-cell fusion when
coexpressed with VZV gB and gH/gL. VZV preferentially infected MAG-transfected
oligodendroglial cells. MAG also associated with HSV-1 gB and enhanced HSV-1
infection of promyelocytes. These findings suggested that MAG is involved in VZV 
and HSV infection of neural tissues.
