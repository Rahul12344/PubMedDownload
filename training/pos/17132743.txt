The complement system, by virtue of its dual effector and priming functions, is a
major host defense against pathogens. Flavivirus nonstructural protein (NS)-1 has
been speculated to have immune evasion activity, because it is a secreted
glycoprotein, binds back to cell surfaces, and accumulates to high levels in the 
serum of infected patients. Herein, we demonstrate an immunomodulatory function
of West Nile virus NS1. Soluble and cell-surface-associated NS1 binds to and
recruits the complement regulatory protein factor H, resulting in decreased
complement activation in solution and attenuated deposition of C3 fragments and
C5b-9 membrane attack complexes on cell surfaces. Accordingly, extracellular NS1 
may function to minimize immune system targeting of West Nile virus by decreasing
complement recognition of infected cells.
