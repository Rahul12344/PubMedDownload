Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in the major natural target cells,
CD4+ T lymphocytes and macrophages, is parallel in many aspects of the virus life
cycle. However, it differs as to viral assembly and budding, which take place on 
plasma membranes in T cells and on endosomal membranes in macrophages. It has
been postulated that cell type-specific host factors may aid in directing viral
assembly to distinct destinations. In this study we defined annexin 2 (Anx2) as a
novel HIV Gag binding partner in macrophages. Anx2-Gag binding was confined to
productively infected macrophages and was not detected in quiescently infected
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in which an HIV replication block was mapped
to the late stages of the viral life cycle (A. V. Albright, R. M. Vos, and F.
Gonzalez-Scarano, Virology 325:328-339, 2004). We demonstrate that the Anx2-Gag
interaction likely occurs at the limiting membranes of late
endosomes/multivesicular bodies and that Anx2 depletion is associated with a
significant decline in the infectivity of released virions; this coincided with
incomplete Gag processing and inefficient incorporation of CD63. Cumulatively,
our data suggest that Anx2 is essential for the proper assembly of HIV in MDM.
