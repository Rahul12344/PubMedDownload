Papillomavirus early gene expression is regulated by the virus gene-encoded E2
proteins. The best-characterized E2 protein, encoded by bovine papillomavirus
type 1 (BPV-1), has been shown to interact with basal transcription factor IIB
(TFIIB) and the TATA binding protein basal transcription factor (N. M. Rank and
P. F. Lambert, J. Virol. 69:6323-6334, 1995). We demonstrate that the potent E2
transcriptional activator protein encoded by a gene of human PV type 16 also
interacts with TFIIB in vitro. Moreover, a direct comparison of domains within
human TFIIB (hTFIIB) required for VP16 and BPV-1 E2 indicates that these acidic
activators interact with hTFIIB in a qualitatively similar manner. Our mapping
experiments identify hTFIIB interaction domains within the amino-terminal
activation domain of BPV-1 E2. Finally, we demonstrate in vitro interaction
between Saccharomyces cerevisiae TFIIB and BPV-1 E2, an observation that is
consistent with the importance of the E2-TFIIB interaction for BPV-1 E2
transactivation in both systems.
