RNA helicase A (RHA) belongs to the DEAH family of proteins that are capable of
unwinding double-stranded RNA structure. In addition to its involvement in the
metabolism of cellular RNA, RHA has been shown to stimulate RNA transcription
from the long terminal repeat promoter of human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) as well as to enhance Rev/Rev response element-mediated gene expression. 
In this study, we provide evidence that RHA associates with HIV-1 Gag in an
RNA-dependent manner. This interaction results in specific incorporation of RHA
into HIV-1 particles. Knockdown of endogenous RHA in virus producer cells leads
to generation of HIV-1 particles that are less infectious in part as a result of 
restricted reverse transcription. Therefore, RHA represents the first example of 
cellular RNA helicases that participate in HIV-1 particle production and promote 
viral reverse transcription.
