Infection by human papillomaviruses (HPV) leads to the formation of benign
lesions, warts, and in some cases, cervical cancer. The formation of these
lesions is dependent upon increased expression of proangiogenic factors.
Angiogenesis is linked to tissue hypoxia through the activity of the
oxygen-sensitive hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). Our studies indicate that 
the HPV E7 protein enhances HIF-1 transcriptional activity whereas E6 functions
to counteract the repressive effects of p53. Both high- and low-risk HPV E7
proteins were found to bind to HIF-1α through a domain located in the N-terminus.
Importantly, the ability of E7 to enhance HIF-1 activity mapped to the C-terminus
and correlated with the displacement of the histone deacetylases HDAC1, HDAC4,
and HDAC7 from HIF-1α by E7. Our findings describe a novel role of the E7
oncoprotein in activating the function of a key transcription factor mediating
hypoxic responses by blocking the binding of HDACs.
