Cellular proteins containing BTB and kelch domains have been shown to function as
adapters for the recruitment of substrates to cullin-3-based ubiquitin ligases.
Poxviruses are the only family of viruses known to encode multiple BTB/kelch
proteins, suggesting that poxviruses may modulate the ubiquitin pathway through
interaction with cullin-3. Ectromelia virus encodes four BTB/kelch proteins and
one BTB-only protein. Here we demonstrate that two of the ectromelia
virus-encoded BTB/kelch proteins, EVM150 and EVM167, interacted with cullin-3.
Similar to cellular BTB proteins, the BTB domain of EVM150 and EVM167 was
necessary and sufficient for cullin-3 interaction. During infection, EVM150 and
EVM167 localized to discrete cytoplasmic regions, which co-localized with
cullin-3. Furthermore, EVM150 and EVM167 co-localized and interacted with
conjugated ubiquitin, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy and
co-immunoprecipitation. Our findings suggest that the ectromelia virus-encoded
BTB/kelch proteins, EVM150 and EVM167, interact with cullin-3 potentially
functioning to recruit unidentified substrates for ubiquitination.
