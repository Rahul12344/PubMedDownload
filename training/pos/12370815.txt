Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are known to
interact with several transcription factors and regulate their transcriptional
activities. The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein
activates transcription from its long terminal repeat (LTR) through interaction
with cellular factors such as CREB and a transcriptional coactivator CBP/p300.
However, little is known about the interaction between Tax and transcriptional
repressors. Here, we demonstrate the physical and functional interaction between 
Tax and HDAC1. We found that HDAC1 represses the trans-activation function of Tax
in 293T and MT4 cells. However, this repression was restored by treatment with an
HDAC inhibitor, Trichostatin A. We also observed physical interaction between Tax
and HDAC1 both in vitro and in vivo. The N-terminal region of HDAC1 (amino acid
residues 28-97) was required for this binding. Moreover, HDAC1 inhibited the
synergistic trans-activation of Tax observed on ectopic expression of CBP.
However, this repression was relieved by overexpression of CBP. Thus, HDAC1 is
likely to compete with CBP in binding with Tax and functions as a negative
regulator for the transcriptional activation by Tax.
