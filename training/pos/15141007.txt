Recently, APOBEC3G has been identified as a host factor that blocks retroviral
replication. It introduces G to A hypermutations in newly synthesized minus
strand viral cDNA at the step of reverse transcription in target cells. Here, we 
identified the human APOBEC3F protein as another host factor that blocks human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication. Similar to APOBEC3G, APOBEC3F 
also induced G to A hypermutations in HIV genomic DNA, and the viral Vif protein 
counteracted its activity. Thus, APOBEC family members might have evolved as a
general defense mechanism of the body against retroviruses, retrotransposons, and
other mobile genetic elements.
