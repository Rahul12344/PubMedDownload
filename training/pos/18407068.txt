Human cytomegalovirus proteins alter host cells to favor virus replication. These
viral proteins include pUL38, which prevents apoptosis. To characterize the mode 
of action of pUL38, we modified the viral genome to encode an epitope-tagged
pUL38 and used rapid immunoaffinity purification to isolate pUL38-interacting
host proteins, which were then identified by mass spectrometry. One of the
cellular proteins identified was TSC2, a constituent of the tuberous sclerosis
tumor suppressor protein complex (TSC1/2). TSC1/2 integrates stress signals and
regulates the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a protein complex
that responds to stress by limiting protein synthesis and cell growth. We showed 
that pUL38 interacts with TSC1 and TSC2 in cells infected with wild-type
cytomegalovirus. Furthermore, TSC1/2 failed to regulate mTORC1 in cells
expressing pUL38, and these cells exhibited the enlarged size characteristic of
cytomegalovirus infection. Thus, pUL38 supports virus replication at least in
part by blocking cellular responses to stress.
