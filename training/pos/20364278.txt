Both fibronectin and the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) have been identified
by some investigators as partners for hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope proteins. 
Because fibronectin is a natural ligand for ASGPR, we speculated that HBV might
attach to ASGPR expressed on the hepatocyte surface via fibronectin. To test this
hypothesis, we first confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation that ASGPR, fibronectin 
and HBsAg bind to each other in HepG2.2.15 cells, and possible binding domains
were identified by GST pull-down. In addition, by measuring binding of HBsAg to
cells, we found that ASGPR and fibronectin enhanced the binding capability of
HBsAg to HepG2 cells, and even to 293T and CHO cells, which normally do not bind 
HBV. In conclusion, our findings suggest that both fibronectin and ASGPR mediate 
HBsAg binding to the cell surface, which provides further evidence for the
potential roles of these two proteins in mediating HBV binding to liver cells.
