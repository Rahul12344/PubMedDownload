HIV-1 Rev plays an important role in the late phase of HIV-1 replication, which
facilitates export of unspliced viral mRNAs from the nucleus to cytoplasm in
infected cells. Recent studies have shown that DDX1 and DDX3 are co-factors of
Rev for the export of HIV-1 transcripts. In this report, we have demonstrated
that DDX5 (p68), which is a multifunctional DEAD-box RNA helicase, functions as a
new cellular co-factor of HIV-1 Rev. We found that DDX5 affects Rev function
through the Rev-RRE axis and subsequently enhances HIV-1 replication. Confocal
microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that DDX5 binds to Rev
and this interaction is largely dependent on RNA. If the DEAD-box motif of DDX5
is mutated, DDX5 loses almost all of its ability to bind to Rev, indicating that 
the DEAD-box motif of DDX5 is required for the interaction between DDX5 and Rev. 
Our data indicate that interference of DDX5-Rev interaction could reduce HIV-1
replication and potentially provide a new molecular target for anti-HIV-1
therapeutics.
