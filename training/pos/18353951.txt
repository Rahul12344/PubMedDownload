The herpes simplex virus UL56 gene is conserved among most members of the
Alphaherpesvirinae family and plays a critical role in viral pathogenicity in
vivo. The HSV-2 UL56 protein (UL56) is a C-terminally anchored type II membrane
protein that is predicted to be inserted into the virion envelope, leaving its
N-terminal domain in the tegument. UL56 interacts with KIF1A and UL11. Here we
report that UL56 also interacts with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and increases its
ubiquitination. Nedd4 was identified as a UL56-interacting protein by a yeast
two-hybrid screen. UL56 bound to Nedd4 via its PY motifs. Nedd4 was
phosphorylated and degraded in wild-type HSV-2-infected cells but not in cells
infected with a UL56-deficient mutant. Ubiquitination assays revealed that UL56
increased ubiquitinated Nedd4, which was actively degraded in infected cells.
UL56 also caused a decrease in Nedd4 protein levels and the increased
ubiquitination in cotransfected cells. However, UL56 itself was not
ubiquitinated, despite its interaction with Nedd4. Based on these findings, we
propose that UL56 regulates Nedd4 in HSV-2-infected cells, although deletion of
UL56 had no apparent effect on viral growth in vitro.
