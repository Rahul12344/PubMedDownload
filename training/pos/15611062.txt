Cell transformation by simian virus 40 (SV40) results mostly from the highly
oncogenic activities of the large T antigen (LT), which corrupts the cellular
checkpoint mechanisms that guard cell division and the transcription,
replication, and repair of DNA. The most prominent LT targets are the
retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and p53. Here we report that LT binds directly to
Fbw7, the substrate recognition component of the SCF(Fbw7) ubiquitin ligase and a
human tumor suppressor. LT binding mislocalizes the nucleolar Fbw7gamma isoform
to the nucleoplasm. Interestingly, the binding of LT to Fbw7 occurs via a decoy
phospho-epitope within the C terminus of LT that closely mimics the consensus
Cdc4 phospho-degron found within Fbw7 substrates. We demonstrate that, using this
mode of interaction, LT can interfere with Fbw7-driven cyclin E turnover in vivo 
and causes increased cyclin E-associated kinase activity. Our data suggest that
LT competes with cellular proteins for Fbw7 binding in a substrate-like fashion.
