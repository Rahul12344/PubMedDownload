Tax, a protein encoded by the env-pX gene of human T-cell leukemia virus type I
(HTLV-I), interacts with various host cell transcription factors. Tax activates
transcription from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HTLV-I through association
with cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Here, we present
evidence that transducer of regulated cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein
3 (TORC3), a co-activator of CREB, is involved in Tax-induced transcriptional
activation from the HTLV-I LTR. By using a luciferase assay system, we show that 
TORC3 alone can enhance transcription from the HTLV-I LTR, as well as from a
cellular cyclic AMP-response element (CRE). Interestingly, we find that
co-expression of TORC3 and Tax dramatically increased transcriptional activation 
at the HTLV-I LTR. We also show by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and
co-immunoprecipitation experiments that TORC3 interacts with Tax. Using deletion 
mutant analysis, we identify the Tax interaction domain of TORC3 as a region
spanning from amino acid 1 to 103, which contains a coiled-coil domain. These
results provide important clues toward understanding the molecular mechanism of
Tax-dependent transcriptional activation of the HTLV-I LTR.
