Novel binding sites for the forkhead transcription factor family member Forkhead 
box A (FoxA), previously referred to as Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3 (HNF3), were 
found within the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV LTR). The
effect of FoxA1 on MMTV LTR chromatin structure, and expression was evaluated in 
Xenopus laevis oocytes. Mutagenesis of either of the two main FoxA binding sites 
showed that the distal site, -232/-221, conferred FoxA1-dependent partial
inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) driven MMTV transcription. The
proximal FoxA binding segment consisted of two individual FoxA sites at -57/-46
and -45/-34, respectively, that mediated an increased basal MMTV transcription.
FoxA1 binding altered the chromatin structure of both the inactive- and the
hormone-activated MMTV LTR. Hydroxyl radical foot printing revealed
FoxA1-mediated changes in the nucleosome arrangement. Micrococcal nuclease
digestion showed the hormone-dependent sub-nucleosome complex, containing
approximately 120 bp of DNA, to be expanded by FoxA1 binding to the proximal
segment into a larger complex containing approximately 200 bp. The potential
function of the FoxA1-mediated expression of the MMTV provirus for maintenance of
expression in different tissues is discussed.
