Overcoming the cellular type I interferon (IFN) host defense response is critical
for a virus to ensure successful infection. Investigating the effects of human
adenovirus (HAdV) infection on global cellular histone posttranslational
modification (hPTM), we discovered that virus infection-induced activation of IFN
signaling triggers a global increase in the monoubiquitination of histone 2B
(H2B) at lysine 120, which is a mark for transcriptionally active chromatin. This
hPTM, catalyzed by the hBre1/RNF20 complex, is necessary for activation of the
cellular IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression program in response to viruses. To 
establish effective infection, the HAdV E1A protein binds to and dissociates
the hBre1 complex to block IFN-induced H2B monoubiquitination and associated ISG 
expression. Together, these data uncover a key role for H2B monoubiquitination in
the type I IFN response and a viral mechanism of antagonizing this hPTM to evade 
the IFN response.
