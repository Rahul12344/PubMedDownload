Lipid rafts are ordered microdomains within cellular membranes that are rich in
cholesterol and sphingolipids. Caveolin (Cav-1) and flotillin (Flt-1) are markers
of lipid rafts, which serve as an organizing center for biological phenomena and 
cellular signaling. Lipid rafts involvement in dengue virus (DENV) processing,
replication, and assembly remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the
role of lipid rafts after DENV endocytosis in human microvascular endothelial
cells (HMEC-1). The non-structural viral proteins NS3 and NS2B, but not NS5, were
associated with detergent-resistant membranes. In sucrose gradients, both NS3 and
NS2B proteins appeared in Cav-1 and Flt-1 rich fractions. Additionally, double
immunofluorescence staining of DENV-infected HMEC-1 cells showed that NS3 and
NS2B, but not NS5, colocalized with Cav-1 and Flt-1. Furthermore, in HMEC-1cells 
transfected with NS3 protease, shown a strong overlap between NS3 and Cav-1,
similar to that in DENV-infected cells. In contrast, double-stranded viral RNA
(dsRNA) overlapped weakly with Cav-1 and Flt-1. Given these results, we
investigated whether Cav-1 directly interacted with NS3. Cav-1 and NS3
co-immunoprecipitated, indicating that they resided within the same complex.
Furthermore, when cellular cholesterol was depleted by methyl-beta cyclodextrin
treatment after DENV entrance, lipid rafts were disrupted, NS3 protein level was 
reduced, besides Cav-1 and NS3 were displaced to fractions 9 and 10 in sucrose
gradient analysis, and we observed a dramatically reduction of DENV particles
release. These data demonstrate the essential role of caveolar cholesterol-rich
lipid raft microdomains in DENV polyprotein processing and replication during the
late stages of the DENV life cycle.
