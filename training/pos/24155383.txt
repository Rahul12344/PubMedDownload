Cytomegaloviruses (CMV) have developed various strategies to escape the immune
system of the host. One strategy involves the expression of virus-encoded
chemokines to modulate the host chemokine network. We have identified in the
English isolate of rat CMV (murid herpesvirus 8 [MuHV8]) an open reading frame
encoding a protein homologous to the chemokine XCL1, the only known C chemokine. 
Viral XCL1 (vXCL1), a glycosylated protein of 96 amino acids, can be detected 13 
h postinfection in the supernatant of MuHV8-infected rat embryo fibroblasts.
vXCL1 exclusively binds to CD4(-) rat dendritic cells (DC), a subset of DC that
express the corresponding chemokine receptor XCR1. Like endogenous rat XCL1,
vXCL1 selectively chemoattracts XCR1(+) CD4(-) DC. Since XCR1(+) DC in mice and
humans have been shown to excel in antigen cross-presentation and thus in the
induction of cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes, the virus has apparently hijacked
this gene to subvert cytotoxic immune responses. The biology of vXCL1 offers an
interesting opportunity to study the role of XCL1 and XCR1(+) DC in the
cross-presentation of viral antigens.
