Herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) are able to hijack the host-cell IkappaB kinase
(IKK)/NF-kappaB pathway, which regulates critical cell functions from apoptosis
to inflammatory responses; however, the molecular mechanisms involved and the
outcome of the signaling dysregulation on the host-virus interaction are mostly
unknown. Here we show that in human keratinocytes HSV-1 attains a sophisticated
control of the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway, inducing two distinct temporally controlled
waves of IKK activity and disrupting the NF-kappaB autoregulatory mechanism.
Using chromatin immunoprecipitation we demonstrate that dysregulation of the
NF-kappaB-response is mediated by a virus-induced block of NF-kappaB recruitment 
to the promoter of the IkappaBalpha gene, encoding the main NF-kappaB-inhibitor. 
We also show that HSV-1 redirects NF-kappaB recruitment to the promoter of ICP0, 
an immediate-early viral gene with a key role in promoting virus replication. The
results reveal a new level of control of cellular functions by invading viruses
and suggest that persistent NF-kappaB activation in HSV-1-infected cells, rather 
than being a host response to the virus, may play a positive role in promoting
efficient viral replication.
