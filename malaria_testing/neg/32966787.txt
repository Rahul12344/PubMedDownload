The replication cycle and pathogenesis of the Plasmodium malarial parasite
involves rapid expansion in red blood cells (RBCs), and variants of certain
RBC-specific proteins protect against malaria in humans. In RBCs,
bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) acts as a key allosteric regulator of
hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin. We demonstrate here that a loss-of-function mutation in
the murine Bpgm (BpgmL166P) gene confers protection against both
Plasmodium-induced cerebral malaria and blood-stage malaria. The malaria
protection seen in BpgmL166P mutant mice is associated with reduced blood
parasitemia levels, milder clinical symptoms, and increased survival. The
protective effect of BpgmL166P involves a dual mechanism that enhances the host's
stress erythroid response to Plasmodium-driven RBC loss and simultaneously alters
the intracellular milieu of the RBCs, including increased oxyhemoglobin and
reduced energy metabolism, reducing Plasmodium maturation, and replication.
Overall, our study highlights the importance of BPGM as a regulator of
hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin in malaria pathogenesis and suggests a new potential
malaria therapeutic target.
