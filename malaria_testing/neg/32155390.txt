Mosquitoes containing gene drive systems are being developed as complementary
tools to prevent transmission of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. As
with any new tool, decision makers and other stakeholders will need to balance
risks (safety) and benefits (efficacy) when considering the rationale for testing
and deploying gene drive-modified mosquito products. Developers will benefit from
standards for judging whether an investigational gene drive product meets
acceptability criteria for advancing to field trials. Such standards may be
formalized as preferred product characteristics and target product profiles,
which describe the desired attributes of the product category and of a particular
product, respectively. This report summarizes discussions from two scientific
workshops aimed at identifying efficacy and safety characteristics that must be
minimally met for an investigational gene drive-modified mosquito product to be
deemed viable to move from contained testing to field release and the data that
will be needed to support an application for first field release.
