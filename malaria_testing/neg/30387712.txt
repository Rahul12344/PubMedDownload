A subset of atypical memory B cells accumulates in malaria and several
infections, autoimmune disorders and aging in both humans and mice. It has been
suggested these cells are exhausted long-lived memory B cells, and their
accumulation may contribute to poor acquisition of long-lasting immunity to
certain chronic infections, such as malaria and HIV. Here, we generated an
immunoglobulin heavy chain knock-in mouse with a BCR that recognizes MSP1 of the 
rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi. In combination with a
mosquito-initiated P. chabaudi infection, we show that Plasmodium-specific
atypical memory B cells are short-lived and disappear upon natural resolution of 
chronic infection. These cells show features of activation, proliferation, DNA
replication, and plasmablasts. Our data demonstrate that Plasmodium-specific
atypical memory B cells are not a subset of long-lived memory B cells, but rather
short-lived activated cells, and part of a physiologic ongoing B-cell response.
