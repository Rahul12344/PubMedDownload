Malaria eradication is critically dependent on new therapeutics that target
resistant Plasmodium parasites and block transmission of the disease. Here, we
report that pantothenamide bioisosteres were active against blood-stage
Plasmodium falciparum parasites and also blocked transmission of sexual stages to
the mosquito vector. These compounds were resistant to degradation by serum
pantetheinases, showed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and cleared
parasites in a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum infection. Metabolomics
revealed that coenzyme A biosynthetic enzymes converted pantothenamides into
coenzyme A analogs that interfered with parasite acetyl-coenzyme A anabolism.
Resistant parasites generated in vitro showed mutations in acetyl-coenzyme A
synthetase and acyl-coenzyme A synthetase 11. Introduction and reversion of these
mutations in P. falciparum using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing confirmed the roles of 
these enzymes in the sensitivity of the malaria parasites to pantothenamides.
These pantothenamide compounds with a new mode of action may have potential as
drugs against malaria parasites.
