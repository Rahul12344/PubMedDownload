Drug resistance compromises control of malaria. Here, we show that resistance to 
a commonly used antimalarial medication, atovaquone, is apparently unable to
spread. Atovaquone pressure selects parasites with mutations in cytochrome b, a
respiratory protein with low but essential activity in the mammalian blood phase 
of the parasite life cycle. Resistance mutations rescue parasites from the drug
but later prove lethal in the mosquito phase, where parasites require full
respiration. Unable to respire efficiently, resistant parasites fail to complete 
mosquito development, arresting their life cycle. Because cytochrome b is encoded
by the maternally inherited parasite mitochondrion, even outcrossing with
wild-type strains cannot facilitate spread of resistance. Lack of transmission
suggests that resistance will be unable to spread in the field, greatly enhancing
the utility of atovaquone in malaria control.
