Plasmodium vivax is the most widely spread species causing human malaria. The
control of malaria caused by P. vivax has been largely hampered by its ability to
develop a dormant liver stage that can generate a new blood infection at
different periods of time. Unfortunately, the mechanisms of dormancy in P. vivax 
have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, the putative dormancy
genes were analyzed to select genes with less genetic variability to maintain the
function of relapsing. Expression data concerning these genes were searched to
support the selection. Protein interactions among selected gene products were
identified based on known and predicted protein-protein interaction using String 
database. Potentially interacting proteins (n = 15) were used to propose a
mechanism involved in dormancy based on the differential vesicular transport due 
to the iron available in the hepatocyte.
