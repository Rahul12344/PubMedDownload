Artemisinin-induced dormancy is a proposed mechanism for failures of monotherapy 
and is linked with artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum. The
biological characterization and dynamics of dormant parasites are not well
understood. Here we report that after dihydroartemisinin treatment in vitro, a
small subset of morphologically dormant parasites was stained with rhodamine 123 
(RH), a mitochondrial membrane potential marker, and persisted to recovery.
RH-positive parasites sorted with fluorescence-activated cell sorting resumed
growth at 10,000/well whereas RH-negative parasites failed to recover at 5
million/well. Furthermore, transcriptional activity for mitochondrial enzymes was
detected only in RH-positive dormant parasites. Importantly, after treatment of
dormant parasites with different concentrations of atovaquone, a mitochondrial
inhibitor, the recovery of dormant parasites was delayed or stopped. This
demonstrates that mitochondrial activity is critical for survival and regrowth of
dormant parasites and that RH staining provides a means of identifying these
parasites. These findings provide novel paths for studying and eradicating this
dormant stage.
