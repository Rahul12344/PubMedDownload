BACKGROUND: Human genetic factors are important determinants of malaria risk. We 
investigated associations between multiple candidate polymorphisms-many related
to the structure or function of red blood cells-and risk for severe Plasmodium
falciparum malaria and its specific phenotypes, including cerebral malaria,
severe malaria anaemia, and respiratory distress.
METHODS: We did a case-control study in Kilifi County, Kenya. We recruited as
cases children presenting with severe malaria to the high-dependency ward of
Kilifi County Hospital. We included as controls infants born in the local
community between Aug 1, 2006, and Sept 30, 2010, who were part of a genetics
study. We tested for associations between a range of candidate malaria-protective
genes and risk for severe malaria and its specific phenotypes. We used a
permutation approach to account for multiple comparisons between polymorphisms
and severe malaria. We judged p values less than 0·005 significant for the
primary analysis of the association between candidate genes and severe malaria.
FINDINGS: Between June 11, 1995, and June 12, 2008, 2244 children with severe
malaria were recruited to the study, and 3949 infants were included as controls. 
Overall, 263 (12%) of 2244 children with severe malaria died in hospital,
including 196 (16%) of 1233 with cerebral malaria. We investigated 121
polymorphisms in 70 candidate severe malaria-associated genes. We found
significant associations between risk for severe malaria overall and
polymorphisms in 15 genes or locations, of which most were related to red blood
cells: ABO, ATP2B4, ARL14, CD40LG, FREM3, INPP4B, G6PD, HBA (both HBA1 and HBA2),
HBB, IL10, LPHN2 (also known as ADGRL2), LOC727982, RPS6KL1, CAND1, and GNAS.
Combined, these genetic associations accounted for 5·2% of the variance in risk
for developing severe malaria among individuals in the general population. We
confirmed established associations between severe malaria and sickle-cell trait
(odds ratio [OR] 0·15, 95% CI 0·11-0·20; p=2·61 × 10-58), blood group O (0·74,
0·66-0·82; p=6·26 × 10-8), and -α3·7-thalassaemia (0·83, 0·76-0·90;
p=2·06 × 10-6). We also found strong associations between overall risk of severe 
malaria and polymorphisms in both ATP2B4 (OR 0·76, 95% CI 0·63-0·92; p=0·001) and
FREM3 (0·64, 0·53-0·79; p=3·18 × 10-14). The association with FREM3 could be
accounted for by linkage disequilibrium with a complex structural mutation within
the glycophorin gene region (comprising GYPA, GYPB, and GYPE) that encodes for
the rare Dantu blood group antigen. Heterozygosity for Dantu was associated with 
risk for severe malaria (OR 0·57, 95% CI 0·49-0·68; p=3·22 × 10-11), as was
homozygosity (0·26, 0·11-0·62; p=0·002).
INTERPRETATION: Both ATP2B4 and the Dantu blood group antigen are associated with
the structure and function of red blood cells. ATP2B4 codes for plasma membrane
calcium-transporting ATPase 4 (the major calcium pump on red blood cells) and the
glycophorins are ligands for parasites to invade red blood cells. Future work
should aim at uncovering the mechanisms by which these polymorphisms can result
in severe malaria protection and investigate the implications of these
associations for wider health.
