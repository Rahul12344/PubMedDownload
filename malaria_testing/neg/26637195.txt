BACKGROUND: Transcriptional responses to small molecules can provide insights
into drug mode of action (MOA). The capacity of the human malaria parasite,
Plasmodium falciparum, to respond specifically to transcriptional perturbations
has been unclear based on past approaches. Here, we present the most extensive
profiling to date of the parasite's transcriptional responsiveness to thirty-one 
chemically and functionally diverse small molecules.
METHODS: We exposed two laboratory strains of the human malaria parasite P.
falciparum to brief treatments of thirty-one chemically and functionally diverse 
small molecules associated with biological effects across multiple pathways based
on various levels of evidence. We investigated the impact of chemical composition
and MOA on gene expression similarities that arise between perturbations by
various compounds. To determine the target biological pathways for each small
molecule, we developed a novelÂ framework for encoding small molecule effects on a
spectra of biological processes or GO functions that are enriched in the
differentially expressed genes of a given small molecule perturbation.
RESULTS: We find that small molecules associated with similar transcriptional
responses contain similar chemical features, and/ or have a shared MOA. The
approach also revealed complex relationships between drugs and biological
pathways that are missed by most exisiting approaches. For example, the approach 
was able to partition small molecule responses into drug-specific effects versus 
non-specific effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work provides a new framework for linking transcriptional
responses to drug MOA in P. falciparum and can be generalized for the same
purpose in other organisms.
