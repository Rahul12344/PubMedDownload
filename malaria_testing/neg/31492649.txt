Immunity that controls parasitemia and inflammation during Plasmodium falciparum 
(Pf) malaria can be acquired with repeated infections. A limited understanding of
this complex immune response impedes the development of vaccines and adjunctive
therapies. We conducted a prospective systems biology study of children who
differed in their ability to control parasitemia and fever following Pf
infection. By integrating whole-blood transcriptomics, flow-cytometric analysis, 
and plasma cytokine and antibody profiles, we demonstrate that a pre-infection
signature of B cell enrichment, upregulation of T helper type 1 (Th1) and Th2
cell-associated pathways, including interferon responses, and p53 activation
associated with control of malarial fever and coordinated with Pf-specific
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Fc receptor activation to control parasitemia. Our
hypothesis-generating approach identified host molecules that may contribute to
differential clinical outcomes during Pf infection. As a proof of concept, we
have shown that enhanced p53 expression in monocytes attenuated
Plasmodium-induced inflammation and predicted protection from fever.
