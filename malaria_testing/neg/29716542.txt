BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent malaria parasite capable
of parasitizing human erythrocytes. The identification of genes related to this
capability can enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
human malaria and lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for
malaria control. With the availability of several malaria parasite genome
sequences, performing computational analysis is now a practical strategy to
identify genes contributing to this disease.
RESULTS: Here, we developed and used a virtual genome method to assign 33,314
genes from three human malaria parasites, namely, P. falciparum, P. knowlesi and 
P. vivax, and three rodent malaria parasites, namely, P. berghei, P. chabaudi and
P. yoelii, to 4605 clusters. Each cluster consisted of genes whose protein
sequences were significantly similar and was considered as a virtual gene.
Comparing the enriched values of all clusters in human malaria parasites with
those in rodent malaria parasites revealed 115 P. falciparum genes putatively
responsible for parasitizing human erythrocytes. These genes are mainly located
in the chromosome internal regions and participate in many biological processes, 
including membrane protein trafficking and thiamine biosynthesis. Meanwhile, 289 
P. berghei genes were included in the rodent parasite-enriched clusters. Most are
located in subtelomeric regions and encode erythrocyte surface proteins.
Comparing cluster values in P. falciparum with those in P. vivax and P. knowlesi 
revealed 493 candidate genes linked to virulence. Some of them encode proteins
present on the erythrocyte surface and participate in cytoadhesion, virulence
factor trafficking, or erythrocyte invasion, but many genes with unknown function
were also identified. Cerebral malaria is characterized by accumulation of
infected erythrocytes at trophozoite stage in brain microvascular. To discover
cerebral malaria-related genes, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) was introduced 
to extract genes highly transcribed at the trophozoite stage. Finally, 55
candidate genes were identified. Considering that parasite-infected erythrocyte
surface protein 2 (PIESP2) contains gap-junction-related Neuromodulin_N domain
and that anti-PIESP2 might provide protection against malaria, we chose PIESP2
for further experimental study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed a limited number of genes linked to human
disease in P. falciparum genome. These genes could be interesting targets for
further functional characterization.
