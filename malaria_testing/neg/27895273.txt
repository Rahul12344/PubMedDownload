Reducing the incidence of malaria has been a public health priority for nearly a 
century. New technologies and associated vector control strategies play an
important role in the prospect of sustained reductions. The development of the
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system has generated new possibilities for the use of
gene-drive constructs to reduce or alter vector populations to reduce malaria
incidence. However, before these technologies can be developed and exploited, it 
will be necessary to understand and assess the likelihood of any potential harms 
to humans or the environment. To begin this process, the Foundation for the
National Institutes of Health and the International Life Sciences Institute
Research Foundation organized an expert workshop to consider the potential risks 
related to the use of gene drives in Anopheles gambiae for malaria control in
Africa. The resulting discussion yielded a series of consensus points that are
reported here.
