BACKGROUND: The objective of this study to detect Plasmodium and a subspecies of 
Plasmodium using filter paper in malaria endemic province, Sanliurfa, in Turkey, 
compare the results of nested PCR (nPCR) with microscopy for the diagnosis of
malaria and present the epidemiological data of malaria.
METHODS: This study was carried out in malaria-endemic Sanliurfa between 2008 and
2011. Finger prick blood samples, thick and thin Giemsa-stained blood smears,
were collected from 153 malaria-suspected farmworkers. The Giemsa-stained blood
smears were examined microscopically. The obtained DNA products, extracted from
blood-spotted filter papers or from the thick blood smears, were analysed by nPCR
to amplify the 18S ssrRNA Plasmodium gene with genus and specific primers. The
results of the microscopy were compared to the nPCR results.
RESULTS: Of the specimens, 7.2 % were determined as Plasmodium-positive by
microscopy, whereas 9.8 % were determined as Plasmodium-positive by nPCR. Of the 
positive Plasmodium specimens, 93.33 % were identified as P. vivax. Four out of
the 15 specimens that were microscopically diagnosed as negative were
Plasmodium-positive with nPCR. When compared to the microscopy, the sensitivity, 
specificity, and positive predictive values of the nPCR were determined as 100,
97.2 and 73.3 %, respectively. nPCR was determined to be more sensitive and
specific than microscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that the accurate diagnosis of malaria by nPCR
was compulsory in malaria-endemic Sanliurfa and nPCR should be applied routinely 
in laboratory studies.
