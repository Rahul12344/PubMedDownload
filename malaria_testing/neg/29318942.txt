This study assesses the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum
parasitemia positivity and P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr)
mutations in parasite isolates among pregnant women in Southwest Nigeria.
Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia was confirmed by microscopy and nested PCR in
200 pregnant women attending antenatal care. The prevalence of pfdhfr
polymorphisms was determined by direct sequencing of the gene fragments
containing the C50R, N51I, C59R, S108N, and I164L mutations. Information on the
use of antimalarial drugs and methods applied to prevent malaria were obtained by
a questionnaire. The prevalence of asymptomatic P. falciparum infection was 30%
(60/200). The frequency of the pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles (N51I, C59R, and
S108N) was 63% (38/60); none of the isolates carried the I164L mutation. Among
the investigated pregnant women, 40% used un-prescribed antimalarials such as
dihydroartemisinin (18%), chloroquine (14%) or pyrimethamine (9%), while only
20.5% used sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for prevention and 39.5% did not use any
drug. The prevalence of P. falciparum parasitemia (37%) was higher among pregnant
women who had not taken any antimalarial drugs. A significant difference in the
prevalence of the pfdhfr triple-mutant alleles was observed among women who
took SP (90%) compared to those who did not take any drug (82%) and women who
took dihydroartemisinin (67%) p = 0.007). Poor adherence to the World Health
Organisation (WHO) strategies for malaria prevention among pregnant women was
observed in addition to high prevalence of pfdhfr mutations. These findings
underline the need to improve control of malaria among pregnant women in the
study area.
