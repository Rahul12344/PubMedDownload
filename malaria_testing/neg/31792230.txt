HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants are disproportionately at a higher risk of
morbidity and mortality, as compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) infants.
Here, we used transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to 
determine immunological signatures of in utero HIV exposure. We identified 262
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HEU compared to HUU infants. Weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified six modules that had
significant associations with clinical traits. Functional enrichment analysis on 
both DEGs and the six significantly associated modules revealed an enrichment of 
G-protein coupled receptors and the immune system, specifically affecting
neutrophil function and antibacterial responses. Additionally, malaria
pathogenicity genes (thrombospondin 1-(THBS 1), interleukin 6 (IL6), and arginine
decarboxylase 2 (ADC2)) were down-regulated. Of interest, the down-regulated
immunity genes were positively correlated to the expression of epigenetic factors
of the histone family and high-mobility group protein B2 (HMGB2), suggesting
their role in the dysregulation of the HEU transcriptional landscape. Overall, we
show that genes primarily associated with neutrophil mediated immunity were
repressed in the HEU infants. Our results suggest that this could be a
contributing factor to the increased susceptibility to bacterial infections
associated with higher morbidity and mortality commonly reported in HEU infants.
