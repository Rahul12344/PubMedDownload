BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major threat to global
malaria control. Parasites develop resistance by gradually acquiring genetic
polymorphisms that decrease drug susceptibility. The aim of this study was to
investigate the extent to which parasites with different genetic characteristics 
are able to withstand individual drug blood concentrations.
METHODS: We analyzed 2 clinical trials that assessed the efficacy and
effectiveness of artemether-lumefantrine. As a proof of concept, we used measured
day 7 lumefantrine concentrations to estimate the concentrations at which
reinfections multiplied. P. falciparum multidrug resistance gene 1 (pfmdr1)
genotypes of these parasites were then correlated to drug susceptibility.
RESULTS: Reinfecting parasites with the pfmdr1 N86/184F/D1246 haplotype were able
to withstand lumefantrine blood concentrations 15-fold higher than those with the
86Y/Y184/1246Y haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS: By estimating drug concentrations, we were able to quantify the
contribution of pfmdr1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms to reduced lumefantrine
susceptibility. The method can be applied to all long-half-life antimalarial
drugs, enables early detection of P. falciparum with reduced drug susceptibility 
in vivo, and represents a novel way for unveiling molecular markers of
antimalarial drug resistance.
