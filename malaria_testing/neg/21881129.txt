BACKGROUND: Binding to chondroitin sulfate A by VAR2CSA, a parasite protein
expressed on infected erythrocytes, allows placental sequestration of Plasmodium 
falciparum-infected erythrocytes. This leads to severe consequences such as
maternal anemia, stillbirths, and intrauterine growth retardation. The latter has
been clearly associated to increased morbidity and mortality of the infants.
Acquired anti-VAR2CSA antibodies have been associated with improved pregnancy
outcomes, suggesting a vaccine could prevent the syndrome. However, identifying
functionally important regions in the large VAR2CSA protein is difficult.
METHODS: Using genetic immunization, we raised polyclonal antisera against
overlapping segments of VAR2CSA in mice and rabbits. The adhesion-inhibition
capacities of induced antisera and of specific antibodies purified from plasma of
malaria-exposed pregnant women were assessed on laboratory-adapted parasite lines
and field isolates expressing VAR2CSA. Competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) was employed to analyze functional resemblance between antibodies
induced in animals and those naturally acquired by immune multigravidae.
RESULTS: Antibodies targeting the N-terminal sequence (NTS) up to DBL2X
(NTS-DBL2X) efficiently blocked parasite adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A in a
manner similar to that of antibodies raised against the entire VAR2CSA
extracellular domain. Interestingly, naturally acquired antibodies and those
induced by vaccination against NTS-DBL2X target overlapping strain-transcendent
anti-adhesion epitopes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights an important step achieved toward development 
of a protective vaccine against placental malaria.
