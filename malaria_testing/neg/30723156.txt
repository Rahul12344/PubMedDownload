The Plasmodium falciparum ATPase PfATP4 is the target of a diverse range of
antimalarial compounds, including the clinical drug candidate cipargamin. PfATP4 
was originally annotated as a Ca2+ transporter, but recent evidence suggests that
it is a Na+ efflux pump, extruding Na+ in exchange for H+ Here we demonstrate
that ATP4 proteins belong to a clade of P-type ATPases that are restricted to
apicomplexans and their closest relatives. We employed a variety of genetic and
physiological approaches to investigate the ATP4 protein of the apicomplexan
Toxoplasma gondii, TgATP4. We show that TgATP4 is a plasma membrane protein.
Knockdown of TgATP4 had no effect on resting pH or Ca2+ but rendered parasites
unable to regulate their cytosolic Na+ concentration ([Na+]cyt). PfATP4
inhibitors caused an increase in [Na+]cyt and a cytosolic alkalinization in WT
but not TgATP4 knockdown parasites. Parasites in which TgATP4 was knocked down or
disrupted exhibited a growth defect, attributable to reduced viability of
extracellular parasites. Parasites in which TgATP4 had been disrupted showed
reduced virulence in mice. These results provide evidence for ATP4 proteins
playing a key conserved role in Na+ regulation in apicomplexan parasites.
