Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells and contain a complex mixture 
of proteins, genetic information and lipids. EVs mediate cell:cell communication 
by transferring their molecular cargo between cells. EVs, initially discovered in
mammalian systems, have been demonstrated to play critical role in immunology and
cancer biology. More recently, EVs have been identified in a broad range of both 
unicellular and multicellular parasites. In this review we focus on the emerging 
roles for EVs in parasitic infections. Parasite-derived EVs can transfer
virulence factors and drug-resistance markers, modify host cell gene expression
and promote parasite adherence and host cell proliferation. EVs can also suppress
or stimulate host immune responses. Thus, EVs are likely important in determining
the outcome of parasitic infections.
