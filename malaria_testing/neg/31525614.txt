OBJECTIVES: To gain insight into the propagation of miltefosine (MIL) resistance 
in visceral leishmaniasis, this laboratory study explored development of
resistant parasites with a defective miltefosine transporter (MT) in sand flies.
METHODS: Infectivity, colonization of stomodeal valve and metacyclogenesis of a
MIL-resistant (MIL-R) Leishmania infantum LEM3323 line with a defective MT were
assessed in the natural sand fly vectors Phlebotomus perniciosus and Lutzomyia
longipalpis. Given our recent description of partial drug dependency of the
MT-deficient line, the impact of MIL pre-exposure on sand fly infectivity was
explored as well.
RESULTS: A significant reduction in sand fly infection, stomodeal valve
colonization and differentiation into metacyclics (determined by a lower
flagellum/cell body length ratio) was observed in both vectors for MIL-R as
compared to the isogenic parent MIL-susceptible line. Re-introduction of the
wildtype MT gene into MIL-R tended to partially rescue the capacity to infect
sand flies. Pre-exposure to MIL did not alter infectivity of the MIL-R line.
CONCLUSION: The MIL resistant L. infantum LEM3323 line is significantly hampered 
in its development and transmissibility potential in two sand fly vector species.
Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether this applies to other
visceral Leishmania parasites with acquired MIL-resistance.
