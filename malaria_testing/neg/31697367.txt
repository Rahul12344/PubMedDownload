The Laverania clade comprises the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum as
well as at least seven additional parasite species that infect wild African apes.
A recent analysis of Laverania genome sequences (Otto TD, et al. 2018. Genomes of
all known members of a Plasmodium subgenus reveal paths to virulent human
malaria. Nat Microbiol. 3: 687-697) reported three instances of interspecies gene
transfer, one of which had previously been described. Generating gene sequences
from additional ape parasites and re-examining sequencing reads generated in the 
Otto et al. study, we identified one of the newly described gene transfers as an 
assembly artifact of sequences derived from a sample coinfected by two parasite
species. The second gene transfer between ancestors of two divergent chimpanzee
parasite lineages was confirmed, but involved a much larger number of genes than 
originally described, many of which encode exported proteins that remodel, or
bind to, erythrocytes. Because successful hybridization between Laverania species
is very rare, it will be important to determine to what extent these gene
transfers have shaped their host interactions.
