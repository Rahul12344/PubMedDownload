Objectives: The CYP2B6 is one of the most polymorphic CYP genes in humans that
has the potential to modify the pharmacological and toxicological responses to
clinically important drugs such as antimalarial artemisinin and its derivatives. 
The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of CYP2B6 polymorphisms in
Timor malaria endemic area, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia where Artemisin-based
Combination Therapy (ACT) has been used to treat uncomplicated malaria.
Methods: A total of 109 healthy subjects were participated in this study.
CYP2B6*4, *6 and *9 polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR-RFLP to confirm the
SNPs prevalence of 516G>T and 785A>G in exon 4 and 5.
Results: There were 96 subjects included in the analysis. In the exon 4 of CYP2B6
516G>T, the frequency of the T mutation was 37.5% (39/96), and the wildtype 27.1%
(26/96). In the exon 5, CYP2B6 785A>G mutant was detected in 29.2% (28/96) of
individuals, and the wildtype allele in 35.4% (34/96). The frequency of CYP2B6*9 
(516G>T), CYP2B6*4 (785A>G) and CYP2B6*6 (516G>T and 785A>G) were 40.6%, 29.2%
and 22.9%, respectively. The prevalence of these CYP2B6 gene polymorphisms in
Timorian ethnic were higher than that in Malay, Han Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian
populations.
Conclusion: The prevalence of these CYP2B6 516G>T and 785A>G polymorphisms in
Timorian ethnic is higher than that in other populations. These polymorphisms may
affect the metabolism of artemisinin and its derivatives.
