Malaria infection during pregnancy, caused by the sequestering of Plasmodium
falciparum parasites in the placenta, leads to high infant mortality and maternal
morbidity. The parasite-placenta adherence mechanism is mediated by the VAR2CSA
protein, a target for natural occurring immunity. Currently, vaccine development 
is based on its ID1-DBL2Xb domain however little is known about the global
genetic diversity of the encoding var2csa gene, which could influence vaccine
efficacy. In a comprehensive analysis of the var2csa gene in >2,000 P. falciparum
field isolates across 23 countries, we found that var2csa is duplicated in high
prevalence (>25%), African and Oceanian populations harbour a much higher
diversity than other regions, and that insertions/deletions are abundant leading 
to an underestimation of the diversity of the locus. Further, ID1-DBL2Xb
haplotypes associated with adverse birth outcomes are present globally, and
African-specific haplotypes exist, which should be incorporated into vaccine
design.
