Studying Ca2+ dynamics in protozoan parasites is not an easy task. Loading of
parasites with commonly used Ca2+ fluorescent dyes (such as Fuo4-AM) remains as
the major protocol to measure the Ca2+ oscillations inside the cell. In this
chapter, we describe an alternative method to study Ca2+ signaling in Plasmodium 
falciparum parasite. This method employs the construction of transgenic parasites
(through standard molecular biology techniques), selection of the transfected
population, and use of those parasites in spectrofluorometric Ca2+ assays.
