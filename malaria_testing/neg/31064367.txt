BACKGROUND: Anopheles sinensis is one of the major malaria vectors in China and
other southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand. Vector
control is considered to be the critical measure for malaria control, while the
increasing prevalence of insecticide resistance caused by long-term use of
insecticides, especially pyrethroids, is threatening the successful control of
An. sinensis. In order to understand the underlying resistance mechanisms
involved and molecular basis, the principal malaria vector, An. sinensis from
Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, Southeast China, was investigated.
METHODS: The adult Anopheles mosquitoes were sampled from multiple sites across
Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, and sufficient mosquitoes collected from eleven
sites for insecticide susceptibility bioassays. The DIIS4-DIIS6 region of the
para-type sodium channel gene was amplified and sequenced, then multiple PCR and 
Taqman assays were used to assess the frequencies of kdr mutations at the target 
gene.
RESULTS: In the present study, most of the adult An. sinensis populations were
pyrethroids resistant, which indicated the presence of kdr resistance mutations
in the para-type sodium channel gene. Sequence analyses demonstrated the kdr
mutation existed at codon 1014 in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. In adult An.
sinensis, three mutant types (TTT L1014F, TTC L1014F, and TGT L1014C) of kdr
alleles were detected, while no wild type (TTG L1014) was observed. The TTC
L1014F mutation was first reported in Anhui province.
CONCLUSIONS: The highly polymorphic kdr alleles were observed in all the adult
An. sinensis populations, which suggested that in-depth studies are required for 
carrying on insecticide resistance monitoring and specific resistance mechanisms 
studying into establish effective long-term malaria vector control program in
eastern China.
