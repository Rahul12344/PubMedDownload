Antibodies can protect from Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection and clinical
malaria disease. However, in the absence of constant reexposure, serum
immunoglobulin (Ig) levels rapidly decline and full protection from clinical
symptoms is lost, suggesting that B cell memory is functionally impaired. We show
at the single cell level that natural Pf infection induces the development of
classical memory B cells (CM) and atypical memory B cells (AtM) that produce
broadly neutralizing antibodies against blood stage Pf parasites. CM and AtM
contribute to anti-Pf serum IgG production, but only AtM show signs of active
antibody secretion. AtM and CM were also different in their IgG gene repertoire, 
suggesting that they develop from different precursors. The findings provide
direct evidence that natural Pf infection leads to the development of protective 
memory B cell antibody responses and suggest that constant immune activation
rather than impaired memory function leads to the accumulation of AtM in malaria.
Understanding the memory B cell response to natural Pf infection may be key to
the development of a malaria vaccine that induces long-lived protection.
