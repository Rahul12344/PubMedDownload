The application of DNA microarray technologies to malaria genomics has been
widely used but has been limited by sample availability and technical
variability. To address these issues, we present a microarray hybridization
protocol that has been optimized for use with two new Agilent Technologies DNA
microarrays for Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei. Using the most recent
genome sequences available for each species, we have designed ∼14,000
oligonucleotide probes representing ∼5,600 transcripts for each species. Included
in each array design are numerous probes that allow for the identification of
parasite developmental stages, common Plasmodium molecular markers used in
genetic manipulation, and manufacturer probes that control for array consistency 
and quality. Overall, the Agilent Plasmodium spp. array designs and hybridization
methodology provides a sensitive, easy-to-use, high-quality, cost-effective
alternative to other currently available microarray platforms.
