Molecular chaperones have been used for the improved expression of target
proteins within heterologous systems; however, the chaperone and target protein
have seldom been matched in terms of origin. We have developed a heterologous
co-expression system that allows independent expression of the plasmodial
chaperone, PfHsp70, and a plasmodial target protein. In this study, the target
was Plasmodium falciparum GTP cyclohydrolase I (PfGCHI), the first enzyme in the 
plasmodial folate pathway. The sequential expression of the molecular chaperone
followed by the target protein increased the expression of soluble functional
PfGCHI. His-tagged PfGCHI was successfully purified using nickel affinity
chromatography, and the specific activity was determined by high performance
liquid chromatography with spectrofluorometeric detection to be 5.93nmol/h/mg.
This is the first report of a heterologous co-expression system in which a
plasmodial chaperone is harnessed for the improved production and purification of
a plasmodial target protein.
