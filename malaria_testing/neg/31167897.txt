The Genetics Society of America's Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal honors researchers for
lifetime achievement in genetics. The recipient of the 2019 Morgan Medal is
Daniel Hartl of Harvard University, who is recognized for his influential and
diverse contributions to genetics research. The unifying theme of Hartl's broad
impacts on transmission, population, evolutionary, and medical genetics has been 
the combination of theoretical insights with cutting-edge experimental
techniques. Some of his contributions include revealing the genetics of
segregation distortion, developing statistical frameworks for estimating the
effects of selection, application of these frameworks to natural and experimental
populations, discovery of the mariner transposon and its influence on genome
evolution, insights into the evolution of gene expression differences, and
modeling the evolution of malaria parasite populations. Hartl is also known as a 
supportive mentor who has trained many prominent geneticists that continue to
shape the field.
