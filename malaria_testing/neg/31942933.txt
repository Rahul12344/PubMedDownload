Subtilisin-like serine peptidases (subtilases) play important roles in the life
cycle of many organisms, including the protozoan parasites that are the causative
agent of malaria, Plasmodium spp. As with other peptidases, subtilase proteolytic
activity has to be tightly regulated in order to prevent potentially deleterious 
uncontrolled protein degradation. Maturation of most subtilases requires the
presence of an N-terminal propeptide that facilitates folding of the catalytic
domain. Following its proteolytic cleavage, the propeptide acts as a transient,
tightly bound inhibitor until its eventual complete removal to generate active
protease. Here we report the identification of a stand-alone malaria parasite
propeptide-like protein, called SUB1-ProM, encoded by a conserved gene that lies 
in a highly syntenic locus adjacent to three of the four subtilisin-like genes in
the Plasmodium genome. Template-based modelling and ab initio structure
prediction showed that the SUB1-ProM core structure is most similar to the X-ray 
crystal structure of the propeptide of SUB1, an essential parasite subtilase that
is discharged into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) to trigger parasite release
(egress) from infected host cells. Recombinant Plasmodium falciparum SUB1-ProM
was found to be a fast-binding, potent inhibitor of P. falciparum SUB1, but not
of the only other essential blood-stage parasite subtilase, SUB2, or of other
proteases examined. Mass-spectrometry and immunofluorescence showed that
SUB1-ProM is expressed in the PV of blood stage P. falciparum, where it may act
as an endogenous inhibitor to regulate SUB1 activity in the parasite.
