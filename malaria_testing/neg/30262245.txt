Acquired antibodies directed towards antigens expressed on the surface of
merozoites and infected erythrocytes play an important role in protective
immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major parasite component of the infected erythrocyte
surface, has been implicated in malaria pathology, parasite sequestration and
host immune evasion. However, the extent to which unique PfEMP1 domains interact 
with host immune response remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to
comprehensively understand the naturally acquired antibody responses targeting
different Duffy binding-like (DBL), and Cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR)
domains in a Ugandan cohort. Consequently, we created a protein library
consisting of full-length DBL (n = 163) and CIDR (n = 108) domains derived from
62-var genes based on 3D7 genome. The proteins were expressed by a wheat germ
cell-free system; a system that yields plasmodial proteins that are comparatively
soluble, intact, biologically active and immunoreactive to human sera. Our
findings suggest that all PfEMP1 DBL and CIDR domains, regardless of PfEMP1
group, are targets of naturally acquired immunity. The breadth of the immune
response expands with children's age. We concurrently identified 10 DBL and 8
CIDR domains whose antibody responses were associated with reduced risk to
symptomatic malaria in the Ugandan children cohort. This study highlights that
only a restricted set of specific domains are essential for eliciting naturally
acquired protective immunity in malaria. In light of current data, tandem domains
in PfEMP1s PF3D7_0700100 and PF3D7_0425800 (DC4) are recommended for extensive
evaluation in larger population cohorts to further assess their potential as
alternative targets for malaria vaccine development.
