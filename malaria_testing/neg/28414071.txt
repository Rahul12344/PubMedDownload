The dynamic chromatin landscape displaying combinatorial complexity of the
epigenome impacts gene expression that underlies many events of differentiation
and cell cycle progression. In the past few years, epigenetic mechanisms have
emerged as important processes involved in the tight gene regulation in malaria
parasites, Plasmodium spp. Focusing predominantly on Plasmodium falciparum, the
species associated with the most severe form of the disease, many advances have
been made in our understanding of the interaction between transcriptional
regulation and epigenetic mechanisms as the pivotal processes in regulating life 
cycle progression, host parasite interactions and parasite adaptation to the host
environment. This review focuses on the epigenome and its effect on
transcriptional regulation in P. falciparum, highlighting its unique,
evolutionary diverse features.
