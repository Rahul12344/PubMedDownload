In sub-Saharan Africa, invasive nontyphoid Salmonella (NTS) infection is a common
and often fatal complication of Plasmodium falciparum infection. Induction of
heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediates tolerance to the cytotoxic effects of heme
during malarial hemolysis but might impair resistance to NTS by limiting
production of bactericidal reactive oxygen species. We show that co-infection of 
mice with Plasmodium yoelii 17XNL (Py17XNL) and Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium 12023 (Salmonella typhimurium) causes acute, fatal bacteremia with
high bacterial load, features reproduced by phenylhydrazine-induced hemolysis or 
hemin administration. S. typhimurium localized predominantly in granulocytes.
Py17XNL, phenylhydrazine and hemin caused premature mobilization of granulocytes 
from bone marrow with a quantitative defect in the oxidative burst. Inhibition of
HO by tin protoporphyrin abrogated the impairment of resistance to S. typhimurium
by hemolysis. Thus, a mechanism of tolerance to one infection, malaria, impairs
resistance to another, NTS. Furthermore, HO inhibitors may be useful adjunctive
therapy for NTS infection in the context of hemolysis.
