Hybrid drugs are multi-target chimeric chemicals combining two or more drugs or
pharmacophores covalently linked in a single molecule. In the field of
anti-infective agents, they have been proposed as a possible solution to drug
resistance issues, presumably having a broader spectrum of activity and less
probability of eliciting high level resistance linked to single gene product.
Although less frequently explored, they could also be useful in the treatment of 
frequently occurring co-infections. Here, we overview recent advances in the
field of hybrid antimicrobials. Furthermore, we discuss some cutting-edge
approaches to face the development of designed multi-target agents in the era of 
omics and big data, namely analysis of gene signatures and multitask QSAR models.
