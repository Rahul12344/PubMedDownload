A myxozoan parasite belonging to the genus Thelohanellus Kudo, 1933 (Cnidaria,
Myxosporea, Bivalvulida) was isolated from the fins of Labeo dero inhabiting
Ranjit Sagar Wetland, Punjab, India. The plasmodium was 0.5-0.7 mm in diameter
each containing 80- 100 number of myxospores. Myxospores were egg shaped to
ovoidal in valvular view having bluntly pointed anterior and broad rounded
posterior end measuring 8.36x 4.77 µm. Polar capsule was single, broadly pyriform
in shape, measuring 4.77x3.98 µm in size containing a polar filament coiled
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of myxospore body making 7-9 turns. Blast 
analysis of 18S rDNA sequence of the isolate demonstrated 98% homogeneity with
Thelohanellus sp. (KU155561, Unpublished), followed by 91% with T. caudatus
(KM252684) and Thelohanellus sp. FCO (KR819273). The intensity of infection was
recorded to be light as indicated by fin plasmodial index (FPI = 1). In the
present study, T. boggoti has been described using 18S rRNA gene and phylogenetic
analysis using MEGA.6.
