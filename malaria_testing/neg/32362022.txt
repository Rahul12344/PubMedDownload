Heterogeneity and high plasticity are common features of cells from the
mononuclear phagocyte system: monocytes (MOs), macrophages, and dendritic cells
(DCs). Upon activation by microbial agents, MO can differentiate into MO-derived 
DCs (MODCs). In previous work, we have shown that during acute infection with
Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA), MODCs become, transiently, the main CD11b+ myeloid
population in the spleen (SP) and once recruited to the brain play an important
role in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM). Here, we isolated
4 cell populations: bone marrow (BM) MOs (BM-MOs) and SP-MOs from uninfected
mice; BM inflammatory MOs (BM-iMOs) and SP-MODCs from PbA-infected mice and used 
a system biology approach to a holistic transcriptomic comparison and provide an 
interactome analysis by integrating differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and
their differentially expressed gene targets (DEGs) data. The Jaccard index (JI)
was used for gauging the similarity and diversity among these cell populations.
Whereas BM-MOs, BM-iMOs, and SP-MOs presented high similarity of DEGs, SP-MODCs
distinguished by showing a greater number of DEGs. Moreover, functional analysis 
identified an enrichment in canonical pathways, such as DC maturation,
neuroinflammation, and IFN signaling. Upstream regulator analysis identified IFNγ
as the potential upstream molecule that can explain the observed DEMs-Target DEGs
intersections in SP-MODCs. Finally, directed target analysis and in vivo/ex vivo 
assays indicate that SP-MODCs differentiate in the SP and IFNγ is a main driver
of this process.
