BACKGROUND: Changes in the natural habitats of insect groups are determined the
genetic polymorphisms between individuals. The objective of this study was to
establish the genetic structure of the Anopheles coluzzii populations in four
localities of Benin.
METHODS: Insecticide surveys and larval sampling were conducted on 4 study
localities, including Cotonou, Ketou, Zagnanado, and Sô-Ava. Molecular
characterizations were performed on the Anopheles mosquitoes collected with the
allelic and genotypic frequencies of kdr gene determined. The multiple comparison
Chi square test for proportions was performed with R version 3.3.3. Next, the
observed heterozygosity, expected heterozygosity, and indices of fixation, and
genetic differentiation were estimated. Finally, the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(EHW) was determined to assess whether panmixia exists in the different
populations of mosquitoes of the agroecological zones under study.
RESULTS: Carbamates, pyrethroids, organophosphorus and organochlorines use have
been reported in all localities except Sô-Ava. Anopheles coluzzii was strongly
represented across all study localities. The L1014F allele was observed in the
localities of Kétou, Cotonou and Zagnanado. Likewise, insecticide selection
pressure of homozygous resistant individuals (L1014F/L1014F) was significantly
higher in Kétou, Cotonou and Zagnanado (p value < 0.05). Surprisingly in Sô-Ava, 
a relatively high frequency of the L1014F allele despite the reported absence of 
pesticide use was observed. All mosquito populations were found to be deficient
in heterozygosity across the study sites (FIS< 0). No genetic differentiation
(FST< 0) was observed in the localities of Zagnanado and Kétou.
CONCLUSION: The survey on the use of insecticides showed that insecticide
selection pressures differ across the investigated localities. It would be
desirable to rotate or apply formulations of combined products with different
modes of action. Doing so would enable a better management of resistant
homozygous individuals, and mitigate the resistance effect of commonly used
insecticides.
