The etiology of human autoimmune diseases in general remains largely unknown,
although the genetic and environmental interplay may be relevant. This applies to
the autoimmune diseases of the skin such as the pemphigus phenotypes and others. 
In this group, there is an endemic form of pemphigus foliaceus (also known as
fogo selvagem [FS]) in which the pathogenic IgG4 autoantibody response to the
self-antigen desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) cross-reacts with the LJM11 sand fly salivary
gland Ag. In this investigation, we dissected the IgG4 autoantibody repertoires
used by FS patients in response to endogenous self-Dsg1 and exogenous LJM11 sand 
fly Ag. Based on analyses of the genetic clonal signatures of these Abs, our
results indicate that there is a significant overlap between these two responses,
as all identified IgG4 mAbs cross-react to both Dsg1 and LJM11 Ags. Germline H-
and L-chain V gene Abs generated according to mutated cross-reactive mAbs
preserved their reactivity to both Ags. Our findings suggest that both Dsg1
autoantigen and LJM11 environmental Ag could be the initial antigenic stimulants 
for the IgG4 autoimmune responses in FS. These results support our hypothesis
that LJM11 Ag plays a substantial role in triggering the IgG4 autoantibody
development in FS and provide new insights on how noninfectious environmental
Ag(s) may drive the generation of autoantibodies in IgG4-related autoimmune
diseases.
