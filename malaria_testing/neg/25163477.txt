Although clinical immunity to malaria eventually develops among children living
in endemic settings, the underlying immunologic mechanisms are not known. The
Vδ2(+) subset of γδ T cells have intrinsic reactivity to malaria antigens, can
mediate killing of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, and expand markedly in vivo 
after malaria infection in previously naïve hosts, but their role in mediating
immunity in children repeatedly exposed to malaria is unclear. We evaluated γδ T 
cell responses to malaria among 4-year-old children enrolled in a longitudinal
study in Uganda. We found that repeated malaria was associated with reduced
percentages of Vδ2(+) γδ T cells in peripheral blood, decreased proliferation and
cytokine production in response to malaria antigens, and increased expression of 
immunoregulatory genes. Further, loss and dysfunction of proinflammatory Vδ2(+)
γδ T cells were associated with a reduced likelihood of symptoms upon subsequent 
P. falciparum infection. Together, these results suggest that repeated malaria
infection during childhood results in progressive loss and dysfunction of Vδ2(+) 
γδ T cells that may facilitate immunological tolerance of the parasite.
