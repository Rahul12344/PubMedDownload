BACKGROUND: Merozoite proteins of the malaria parasites involved in the invasion 
of red blood cells are selected by host immunity and their diversity is greatly
influenced by changes in malaria epidemiology. In the Greater Mekong Subregion
(GMS), malaria transmission is concentrated along the international borders and
there have been major changes in malaria epidemiology with Plasmodium vivax
becoming the dominant species in many regions. Here, we aimed to evaluate the
genetic diversity of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein gene domain II (pvdbp-II) in 
isolates from the eastern and western borders of Myanmar, and compared it with
that from global P. vivax populations.
METHODS: pvdbp-II sequences were obtained from 85 and 82 clinical P. vivax
isolates from the eastern and western Myanmar borders, respectively. In addition,
504 pvdbp-II sequences from nine P. vivax populations of the world were retrieved
from GenBank and used for comparative analysis of genetic diversity,
recombination and population structure of the parasite population.
RESULTS: The nucleotide diversity of the pvdbp-II sequences from the Myanmar
border parasite isolates was not uniform, with the highest diversity located
between nucleotides 1078 and 1332. Western Myanmar isolates had a unique R391C
mutation. Evidence of positive natural selection was detected in pvdbp-II gene in
P. vivax isolates from the eastern Myanmar area. P. vivax parasite populations in
the GMS, including those from the eastern, western, and central Myanmar as well
as Thailand showed low-level genetic differentiation (FST, 0.000-0.099).
Population genetic structure analysis of the pvdbp-II sequences showed a division
of the GMS populations into four genetic clusters. A total of 60 PvDBP-II
haplotypes were identified in 210 sequences from the GMS populations. Among the
epitopes in PvDBP-II, high genetic diversity was found in epitopes 45
(379-SIFGT(D/G)(E/K)(K/N)AQQ(R/H)(R/C)KQ-393, π = 0.029) and Ia
(416-G(N/K)F(I/M)WICK(L/I)-424], Ib [482-KSYD(Q/E)WITR-490, π = 0.028) in P.
vivax populations from the eastern and western borders of Myanmar.
CONCLUSIONS: The pvdbp-II gene is genetically diverse in the eastern and western 
Myanmar border P. vivax populations. Positive natural selection and recombination
occurred in pvdbp-II gene. Low-level genetic differentiation was identified,
suggesting extensive gene flow of the P. vivax populations in the GMS. These
results can help understand the evolution of the P. vivax populations in the
course of regional malaria elimination and guide the design of PvDBP-II-based
vaccine.
