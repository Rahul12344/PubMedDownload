BACKGROUND: Vector-borne apicomplexan parasites are a major cause of mortality
and morbidity to humans and livestock globally. The most important disease
syndromes caused by these parasites are malaria, babesiosis and theileriosis.
Strategies for control often target parasite stages in the mammalian host that
cause disease, but this can result in reservoir infections that promote pathogen 
transmission and generate economic loss. Optimal control strategies should
protect against clinical disease, block transmission and be applicable across
related genera of parasites. We have used bioinformatics and transcriptomics to
screen for transmission-blocking candidate antigens in the tick-borne
apicomplexan parasite, Theileria annulata.
RESULTS: A number of candidate antigen genes were identified which encoded amino 
acid domains that are conserved across vector-borne Apicomplexa (Babesia,
Plasmodium and Theileria), including the Pfs48/45 6-cys domain and a novel
cysteine-rich domain. Expression profiling confirmed that selected candidate
genes are expressed by life cycle stages within infected ticks. Additionally,
putative B cell epitopes were identified in the T. annulata gene sequences
encoding the 6-cys and cysteine rich domains, in a gene encoding a putative
papain-family cysteine peptidase, with similarity to the Plasmodium SERA family, 
and the gene encoding the T. annulata major merozoite/piroplasm surface antigen, 
Tams1.
CONCLUSIONS: Candidate genes were identified that encode proteins with similarity
to known transmission blocking candidates in related parasites, while one is a
novel candidate conserved across vector-borne apicomplexans and has a potential
role in the sexual phase of the life cycle. The results indicate that a 'One
Health' approach could be utilised to develop a transmission-blocking strategy
effective against vector-borne apicomplexan parasites of animals and humans.
