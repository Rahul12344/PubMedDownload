The phist gene family has members identified across the Plasmodium genus, defined
by the presence of a domain of roughly 150 amino acids having conserved aromatic 
residues and an all alpha-helical structure. The family is highly amplified in P.
falciparum, with 65 predicted genes in the genome of the 3D7 isolate. In
contrast, in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei 3 genes are identified, one
of which is an apparent pseudogene. Transcripts of the P. berghei phist genes are
predominant in schizonts, whereas in P. falciparum transcript profiles span
different asexual blood stages and gametocytes. We pursued targeted disruption of
P. berghei phist genes in order to characterize a simplistic model for the
expanded phist gene repertoire in P. falciparum. Unsuccessful attempts to disrupt
P. berghei PBANKA_114540 suggest that this phist gene is essential, while
knockout of phist PBANKA_122900 shows an apparent normal progression and
non-essential function throughout the life cycle. Epitope-tagging of P.
falciparum and P. berghei phist genes confirmed protein export to the erythrocyte
cytoplasm and localization with a punctate pattern. Three P. berghei
PEXEL/HT-positive exported proteins exhibit at least partial co-localization, in 
support of a common vesicular compartment in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes
infected with rodent malaria parasites.
