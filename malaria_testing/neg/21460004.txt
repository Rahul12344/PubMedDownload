Chemoprophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and primaquine has been used in
the Republic of Korea (ROK) Army since 1997. It may facilitate the development of
chloroquine (CQ)-resistant strains of Plasmodium vivax. We investigated the
therapeutic efficacy of HCQ and the pvmdr1 gene polymorphisms in P. vivax. From
June to September 2006, 102 soldiers with vivax malaria near the demilitarized
zone in Gyeonggi-do, ROK, were enrolled in the study. We determined the status of
compliance of chemoprophylaxis. In 85 patients, therapeutic efficacy was
monitored 28 days after standard HCQ treatment; 66 (64.7%) of 102 malaria
patients had taken all chemoprolaxis with HCQ. In all patients enrolled in the
therapeutic efficacy monitoring, parasitemia had not been observed since 3 days
after standard HCQ treatment. However, the ubiquitous presence of the F1076L
mutation of the pvmdr1 was observed. There was no evidence that the F1076L
mutation of pvmdr1 could contribute to failure of HCQ treatment.
