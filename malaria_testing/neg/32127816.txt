Introduction: Despite a significant decline in Senegal, malaria remains a burden 
in various parts of the country. Assessment of multiplicity of Plasmodium
falciparum infection and genetic diversity of parasites population could help in 
monitoring of malaria control.
Objective: To assess genetic diversity and multiplicity of infection in P.
falciparum isolates from three areas in Senegal with different malaria
transmissions.
Methods: 136 blood samples were collected from patients with uncomplicated P.
falciparum malaria in Pikine, Kedougou and Thies. Polymorphic loci of msp1 and 2 
(Merozoite surface protein-1 and 2) genes were amplified by nested PCR.
Results: For msp1gene, K1 allelic family was predominant with frequency of 71%.
Concerning msp2 gene, IC3D7 allelic family was the most represented with
frequency of 83%. Multiclonal isolates found were 36% and 31% for msp1et msp2
genes respectively. The MOI found in all areas was 2.56 and was statistically
different between areas (P=0.024). Low to intermediate genetic diversity were
found with heterozygosity range (He=0,394-0,637) and low genetic differentiation 
(Fst msp1= 0.011; Fst msp2=0.017) were observed between P. falciparum population 
within the country.
Conclusion: Low to moderate genetic diversity of P.falciparum strains and MOI
disparities were found in Senegal.
