The aim of this study was to develop a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)
combined with a lateral flow (LF) strip method for specific diagnosis of
Plasmodium knowlesi. With incubation at 37°C, the 18S rRNA gene of P. knowlesi
was successfully amplified within 12 minutes. By adding a specifically designed
probe to the reaction solution, the amplified RPA product can be visualized on a 
LF strip. The RPA assay exhibited high sensitivity with limits of detection down 
to 10 parasites/μL of P. knowlesi. Nonetheless, it was demonstrated that all P.
knowlesi (N = 41) and other Plasmodium sp. (N = 25) were positive while negative 
samples (N = 8) were negative. Therefore, a combination of RPA and LF strip
detection is a highly promising approach with the potential to be suitable for
use in resource-limited settings.
