BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe human malaria,
is an early-diverging protozoan whose lifecycle has many unusual features,
including its modes of replication. Research on the Plasmodium cell cycle, which 
occurs primarily via schizogony instead of canonical binary fission, has been
hampered by a lack of tools and markers that can be transferred from cell cycle
studies in model organisms. A common tool used to study DNA replication and the
cell cycle in human cells is the labelling of newly-replicated DNA with the
modified nucleotide bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), followed by immunofluorescent
detection. Plasmodium parasites, however, do not incorporate BrdU because they
rely only on de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and do not salvage thymidine
analogues like BrdU for conversion into nucleotides.
METHODS: Analysis of biochemical pathways in Plasmodium indicated that the
absence of the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) may be the only impediment to BrdU
incorporation in this organism. A TK gene from Herpes simplex was, therefore,
introduced into the Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain and the effect on BrdU
labelling was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and
immunofluorescence microscopy.
RESULTS: Introduction of a TK gene produces parasites that can indeed incorporate
BrdU. This forms a sensitive indicator of DNA replication, which can be detected 
by both quantitative and qualitative assays on either a population level or a
single-cell level. Plasmodium falciparum, when expressing TK, becomes unusually
sensitive to BrdU toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: BrdU labelling represents a significant new tool for investigating
DNA replication and the cell cycle in Plasmodium.
