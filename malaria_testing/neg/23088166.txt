BACKGROUND: The naturally fluorescent compound quinine has long been used to
treat malaria infections. Although some evidence suggests that quinine acts in
the parasite food vacuole, the mechanism of action of quinine has not yet been
resolved. The Plasmodium falciparum multidrug resistance (pfmdr1) gene encodes a 
food vacuolar membrane transporter and has been linked with parasite resistance
to quinine. The effect of multiple pfmdr1 copies on the subcellular localization 
of quinine was explored.
METHODS: Fluorescence microscopy was used to evaluate the subcellular
localization of quinine in parasites containing different pfmdr1 copy numbers to 
determine if copy number of the gene affects drug localization. The acidotropic
dye LysoTracker Red was used to label the parasite food vacuole. Time-lapse
images were taken to determine quinine localization over time following quinine
exposure.
RESULTS: Regardless of pfmdr1 copy number, quinine overlapped with haemozoin but 
did not colocalize with LysoTracker Red, which labeled the acidic parasite food
vacuole.
CONCLUSIONS: Quinine localizes to a non-acidic compartment within the food
vacuole possibly haemozoin. Pfmdr1 copy number does not affect quinine
subcellular localization.
