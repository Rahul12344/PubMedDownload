Background & objectives: Plasmodium parasite harbours unique methylerythritol
phosphate (MEP) pathway which is obligatory for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. 
In malaria parasites, the isoprenoids are indispensable during hepatic,
erythrocytic and gametocytic stages. Owing to the criticality of MEP pathway and 
the potential of its enzymes to act as antimalarial drug target, this study
comprehensively investigated the genetic diversity and structural composition of 
4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methyl-D-erythritol kinase (IspE), fourth enzyme of MEP
pathway in Indian Plasmodium falciparum (PfIspE).
Methods: The study employed sequencing, modeling and bioinformatics approaches to
examine the genetic diversity and associated structural polymorphism in the
PfIspE gene amplified from the clinical blood samples collected from seven
malaria endemic geographical regions of India.
Results: The sequence analysis showed that PfIspE gene is highly conserved with
100% sequence identity among all the P. falciparum Indian isolates as well as
with the PfIspE gene of reference strain 3D7. Phylogenetic analysis suggested
that PfIspE is highly evolved and differ sufficiently from human orthologue
mevalonate kinase gene. Structural modeling studies revealed that PfIspE has
conserved ATP and CDPME-binding domains. The active site was observed to be
relatively rigid in architecture with >60% Î²-pleated sheets.
Interpretation & conclusion: The results of genetic, phylogeny and modeling
studies strengthen the potential of PfIspE enzyme as a promising antimalarial
drug target.
