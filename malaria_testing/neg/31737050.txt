While efforts to control malaria with available tools have stagnated, and
arbovirus outbreaks persist around the globe, the advent of clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing has provided
exciting new opportunities for genetics-based strategies to control these
diseases. In one such strategy, called "population replacement", mosquitoes, and 
other disease vectors are engineered with effector genes that render them unable 
to transmit pathogens. These effector genes can be linked to "gene drive" systems
that can bias inheritance in their favor, providing novel opportunities to
replace disease-susceptible vector populations with disease-refractory ones over 
the course of several generations. While promising for the control of
vector-borne diseases on a wide scale, this sets up an evolutionary tug-of-war
between the introduced effector genes and the pathogen. Here, we review the
disease-refractory genes designed to date to target Plasmodium falciparum malaria
transmitted by Anopheles gambiae, and arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti,
including dengue serotypes 2 and 3, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. We discuss
resistance concerns for these effector genes, and genetic approaches to prevent
parasite and viral escape variants. One general approach is to increase the
evolutionary hurdle required for the pathogen to evolve resistance by attacking
it at multiple sites in its genome and/or multiple stages of development. Another
is to reduce the size of the pathogen population by other means, such as with
vector control and antimalarial drugs. We discuss lessons learned from the
evolution of resistance to antimalarial and antiviral drugs and implications for 
the management of resistance after its emergence. Finally, we discuss the target 
product profile for population replacement strategies for vector-borne disease
control. This differs between early phase field trials and wide-scale disease
control. In the latter case, the demands on effector gene efficacy are great;
however, with new possibilities ushered in by CRISPR-based gene editing, and when
combined with surveillance, monitoring, and rapid management of pathogen
resistance, the odds are increasingly favoring effector genes in the upcoming
evolutionary tug-of-war.
