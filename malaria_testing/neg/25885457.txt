BACKGROUND: Studies on the East African coast have shown a recent dramatic
decline in malaria vector density and change in composition of sibling species of
the Anopheles gambiae complex, paralleled by a major decline in malaria
incidence. In order to better understand the ongoing changes in vector-parasite
dynamics in the area, and to allow for appropriate adjustment of control
activities, the present study examined the composition, and malaria and lymphatic
filarial infection, of sibling species of the Anopheles funestus group. Similar
to the An. gambiae complex, the An. funestus group contains important vectors of 
both malaria and lymphatic filariasis.
METHODS: Archived (from 2005-2012) and newly collected (from 2014) specimens of
the An. funestus group collected indoors using CDC light traps in villages in
northeastern Tanzania were analysed. They were identified to sibling species by
PCR based on amplification of species-specific nucleotide sequence in the ITS2
region on rDNA genes. The specimens were furthermore examined for infection with 
Plasmodium falciparum and Wuchereria bancrofti by PCR.
RESULTS: The identified sibling species were An. funestus s.s., Anopheles
parensis, Anopheles rivulorum, and Anopheles leesoni, with the first being by far
the most common (overall 94.4%). When comparing archived specimens from 2005-2007
to those from 2008-2012, a small but statistically significant decrease in
proportion of An. funestus s.s. was noted, but otherwise observed temporal
changes in sibling species composition were minor. No P. falciparum was detected 
in archived specimens, while 8.3% of the newly collected An. funestus s.s. were
positive for this parasite. The overall W. bancrofti infection rate decreased
from 14.8% in the 2005-2007 archived specimens to only 0.5% in the newly
collected specimens, and with overall 93.3% of infections being in An. funestus
s.s.
CONCLUSION: The study indicated that the composition of the An. funestus group
had remained rather stable during the study period, with An. funestus s.s. being 
the most predominant. The study also showed increasing P. falciparum infection
and decreasing W. bancrofti infection in An. funestus s.s. in the study period,
most likely reflecting infection levels with these parasites in the human
population in the area.
