A wild-caught, juvenile Shikra (Accipiter badius) was evaluated for
rehabilitation at the Kasetsart University Raptor Rehabilitation Unit (KURRU)
with a history of weakness. Plasmodium sp. was observed by both light and
electron microscopy in blood obtained on day 1 of evaluation. Based on the
appearance of erythrocytic meronts and gametocytes, the parasites were defined as
Plasmodium (Giovannolaia) circumflexum. The sequence analysis of the
mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from the plasmodia was closely related to
parasites found in the Grey-headed woodpecker from Myanmar and the Brown hawk-owl
from Singapore. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed organelles
in the haematozoa and heterophils that ingested the plasmodia. This is the first 
recorded case of Plasmodium circumflexum in a wild Shikra. This note emphasises
the molecular characterisation and ultra-structure of the haematozoa.
