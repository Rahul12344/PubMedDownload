BACKGROUND: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are essential in the metabolism of most
drugs used today. Single nucleotide polymorphism(s) occurring in CYP genes can
adversely affect drug pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. Individuals
carrying the CYP2C8*2 c.805A > T (CYP2C8*2; rs11572103) allele have impaired
amodiaquine metabolism, increased risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events, and
may promote the selection of drug-resistant parasite strains. This study
investigated the distribution of the CYP2C8*2 allele in Brazzaville, Republic of 
Congo, where artesunate + amodiaquine is used as the second-line treatment for
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria.
METHODS: A total of 285 febrile children visiting the Marien Ngouabi paediatric
hospital were genotyped for CYP2C8*2 using PCR-restriction fragment length
polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The allele frequencies and genotype distribution were
determined.
RESULTS: The CYP2C8*2 allele was successfully genotyped in 75% (213/285) of the
study participants. The CYP2C8*2A allele had a frequency of 63%, whereas the
CYP2C8*2T allele had a frequency of 37%. Genotypes CYP2C8*2AA (rapid
metabolizer), CYP2C8*2AT (intermediate metabolizer), and CYP2C8*2TT (poor
metabolizer) were observed in 44%, 38%, and 18% of the investigated participants,
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study gives the first description of CYP2C8*2 allele
distribution in the Republic of Congo and highlights the potential risk of
amodiaquine-related adverse events. Information from this study will be
beneficial during pharmacovigilance investigations.
