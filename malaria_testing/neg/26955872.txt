BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is now commonly used as a method to
confirm diagnosis of malaria and to differentiate recrudescence from
re-infection, especially in clinical trials and in reference laboratories where
precise quantification is critical. Although anti-malarial drug discovery is
based on in vivo murine efficacy models, use of molecular analysis has been
limited. The aim of this study was to develop qPCR as a valid methodology to
support pre-clinical anti-malarial models by using filter papers to maintain
material for qPCR and to compare this with traditional methods.
METHODS: FTA technology (Whatman) is a rapid and safe method for extracting
nucleic acids from blood. Peripheral blood samples from mice infected with
Plasmodium berghei, P. yoelii, or P. falciparum were kept as frozen samples or as
spots on FTA cards. The extracted genetic material from both types of samples was
assessed for quantification by qPCR using sets of specific primers specifically
designed for Plasmodium 18S rRNA, LDH, and CytB genes.
RESULTS: The optimal conditions for nucleic acid extraction from FTA cards and
qPCR amplification were set up, and were confirmed to be suitable for parasite
quantification using DNA as template after storage at room temperature for as
long as 26 months in the case of P. berghei samples and 52 months for P.
falciparum and P. yoelii. The quality of DNA extracted from the FTA cards for
gene sequencing and microsatellite amplification was also assessed.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to report the suitability of FTA cards and
qPCR assay to quantify parasite load in samples from in vivo efficacy models to
support the drug discovery process.
