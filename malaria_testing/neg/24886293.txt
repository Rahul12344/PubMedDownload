BACKGROUND: In recent years, it has been well documented that gut flora not only 
influence mosquito physiology, but also significantly alter vector competency.
Although, salivary gland and gut constitute key partners of the digestive system,
it is still believed that salivary glands may harbor less flora than gut (Parasit
Vectors 6: 146, 2013).
METHODS: Using a metagenomic approach, we have identified for the first time the 
diverse microbial community associated with these two physiologically different
tissues of the digestive system in the mosquito Anopheles culicifacies.
RESULTS: A total of 17 different phyla could be assigned to the whole metagenomic
dataset, predominated by the phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes,
Tenericutes and Actinomycetes. Common bacteria included the members of
Enhydrobacter, Agromonas, Serratia, Ralsonia, Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas,
Streptococcus, Rubrobacter, Anaerococcus, Methylobacterium, Turicibacter,
Elizabethkingia etc. in both the tissues representing 'core microbiota' of the
mosquito digestive system. Salivary associated unique bacterial community
included the members of Chloriflexi, Chlorobi, Cyanobacteria, Nitrospira, TM7,
Armatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Fibrobacteres etc.
CONCLUSION: We find that the salivary gland microbial community structure is more
diverse than gut of the mosquito, probably due to differential feeding associated
engagements such as food acquisition, ingestion and digestion processes.
