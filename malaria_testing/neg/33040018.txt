PURPOSE: A successful pregnancy relies on the interplay of various biological
systems. Deviations from the norm within a system or intersystemic interactions
may result in pregnancy-associated complications and adverse pregnancy outcomes. 
Systems biology approaches provide an avenue of unbiased, in-depth phenotyping in
health and disease. The molecular signature in pregnancy (MSP) cohort was
established to characterise longitudinal, cross-omic trajectories in pregnant
women from a resource constrained setting. Downstream analysis will focus on
characterising physiological perturbations in uneventful pregnancies,
pregnancy-associated complications and adverse outcomes.
PARTICIPANTS: First trimester pregnant women of Karen or Burman ethnicity were
followed prospectively throughout pregnancy, at delivery and until 3 months post 
partum. Serial high-frequency sampling to assess whole blood transcriptomics and 
microbiome composition of the gut, vagina and oral cavity, in conjunction with
assessment of gene expression and microbial colonisation of gestational tissue,
was done for all cohort participants.
FINDINGS TO DATE: 381 women with live born singletons averaged 16 (IQR 15-18)
antenatal visits (13 094 biological samples were collected). At 5% (19/381) the
preterm birth rate was low. Other adverse events such as maternal febrile illness
7.1% (27/381), gestational diabetes 13.1% (50/381), maternal anaemia 16.3%
(62/381), maternal underweight 19.2% (73/381) and a neonate born small for
gestational age 20.2% (77/381) were more often observed than preterm birth.
FUTURE PLANS: Results from the MSP cohort will enable in-depth characterisation
of cross-omic molecular trajectories in pregnancies from a population in a
resource-constrained setting. Moreover, pregnancy-associated complications and
unfavourable pregnancy outcomes will be investigated at the same granular level, 
with a particular focus on population relevant needs such as effect of tropical
infections on pregnancy. More detailed knowledge on multiomic perturbations will 
ideally result in the development of diagnostic tools and ultimately lead to
targeted interventions that may disproportionally benefit pregnant women from
this resource-limited population.
