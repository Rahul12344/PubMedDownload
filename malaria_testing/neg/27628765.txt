BACKGROUND: Understanding the dynamics of insecticide resistance in African
malaria vectors is crucial for successful implementation of resistance management
strategies in the continent. This study reports a high and multiple insecticide
resistance in Anopheles funestus from southern Ghana which could compromise the
Malaria Operational Plan in this country, if not tackled. Adult Anopheles
mosquitoes were collected in Obuasi and Adawukwa, in southern Ghana. Plasmodium
infection rates, susceptibility to the main insecticides used in public health
and the molecular basis of insecticide resistance were established.
RESULTS: An. funestus (sensu stricto) (s.s.) was the predominant mosquito species
found resting inside the houses in Obuasi, while at Adawukwa it was found
together with An. coluzzii. Parasite rates were high in An. funestus (s.s.)
populations from both localities, with Plasmodium infection rates greater than
12.5 %. Both, An. funestus (s.s.) and An. coluzzii, from the two sites exhibited 
high resistance to the insecticide from various classes including the
pyrethroids, carbamates and DDT, but remained fully susceptible to the
organophosphates. A preliminary characterization of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of resistance in An. funestus (s.s.) populations from both sites
revealed that CYP6P9a, CYP6P9b, CYP6M7 and GSTe2 genes are upregulated, markedly 
higher in Obuasi (between 3.35 and 1.83 times) than in Adawukwa population. The
frequency of L119F-GSTe2 and A296S-RDL resistance markers were also higher in
Obuasi (42.5 and 68.95 % higher), compared with An. funestus (s.s.) populations
from Adawukwa. These findings suggest that the similar resistance pattern
observed in both An. funestus (s.s.) populations are driven by different
mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to multiple insecticides in public health use is present 
in malaria vectors from Ghana with major resistance genes already operating in
the field. This should be taken into consideration in the design of resistance
management strategies to avoid operational failure.
