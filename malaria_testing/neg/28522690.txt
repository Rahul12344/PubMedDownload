The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum invades human red blood cells by a
series of interactions between host and parasite surface proteins. By analyzing
genome sequence data from human populations, including 1269 individuals from
sub-Saharan Africa, we identify a diverse array of large copy-number variants
affecting the host invasion receptor genes GYPA and GYPB We find that a nearby
association with severe malaria is explained by a complex structural
rearrangement involving the loss of GYPB and gain of two GYPB-A hybrid genes,
which encode a serologically distinct blood group antigen known as Dantu. This
variant reduces the risk of severe malaria by 40% and has recently increased in
frequency in parts of Kenya, yet it appears to be absent from west Africa. These 
findings link structural variation of red blood cell invasion receptors with
natural resistance to severe malaria.
