Malaria is one of the three most deadly diseases in the world. Artemisinin is the
first line and effective drug for treating malaria, and only can be extracted
from Artemisia annua. Therefore, it is of great significance to cultivate new
varieties of A. annua with high artemisinin content. Based on the germplasm bank 
and the whole genome, transcriptome and genetic map, the authors can explore
high-quality genes, stress-resistant genes and genetic markers which have been
used for rapid breeding of superior varieties of A. annua. So these methods of
molecular breeding will become the main breeding direction of A. annua in the
future. The breeding times of new varieties of A. annua can be shortened with
molecular breeding technology. Based on the genetic background and the current
situation of molecular breeding of A. annua, the strategy and technical route of 
molecular breeding were discussed and worked out in this paper, which provided a 
guidance and scientific reference for molecular breeding of A. annua in the
future.
