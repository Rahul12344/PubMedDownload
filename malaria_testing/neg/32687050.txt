14 Years as First-Line Malaria Treatment, Zanzibar.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are first-line treatments for
uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. ACT resistance is spreading in Asia 
but not yet in Africa. Reduced effects of ACT partner drugs have been reported
but with little information regarding widely used artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ). 
We studied its efficacy in Zanzibar after 14 years as first-line treatment
directly by an in vivo, single-armed trial and indirectly by prevalences of
different genotypes in the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistance transporter,
multidrug-resistance 1, and Kelch 13 propeller domain genes. In vivo efficacy was
higher during 2017 (100%; 95% CI 97.4%-100%) than during 2002-2005 (94.7%; 95% CI
91.9%-96.7%) (p = 0.003). Molecular findings showed no artemisinin
resistance-associated genotypes and major increases in genotypes associated with 
high sensitivity/efficacy for amodiaquine than before ASAQ was introduced. Thus, 
the efficacy of ASAQ is maintained and appears to be increased after long-term
use in contrast to what is observed for other ACTs used in Africa.
