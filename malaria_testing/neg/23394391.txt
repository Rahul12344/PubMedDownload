BACKGROUND: NAT2, a broad-spectrum drug-metabolizing gene, is of high
pharmacogenetic interest. Based on seven different mutations in the NAT2 gene, an
individual can either be categorized as a slow or fast acetylator.
MATERIALS & METHODS: In order to characterize acetylation profiles of Indians,
where data are poorly available, we sequenced the 873 bp NAT2 coding region in
250 Indians, covering the whole of India including three tribes.
RESULTS: Altogether, 35 NAT2 alleles forming two acetylator phenotypes
(distributed almost in equal proportion in India) were found; while the alleles
determining slow acetylators were highly differentiated, the fast acetylator
alleles were less in number but highly frequent.
CONCLUSION: Interestingly, distribution of two different acetylation phenotypes
correlated well with historical dietary pattern in India. The neighbor-joining
phylogenetic tree based on NAT2 gene polymorphisms in worldwide humans revealed
genetic affinities among populations with similar acetylation phenotypes, which
also placed Indians and Africans together in a single cluster.
