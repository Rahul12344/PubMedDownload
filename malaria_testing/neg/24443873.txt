A recent study found that mosquito-transmitted (MT) lines of rodent malaria
parasites elicit a more effective immune response than non-transmitted lines
maintained by serial blood passage (non-MT), thereby causing lower parasite
densities in the blood and less pathology to the host. The authors attribute
these changes to higher diversity in expression of antigen-encoding genes in MT
cf. non-MT lines. Alternative explanations that are equally parsimonious with
these new data, and results from previous studies, suggest that this conclusion
may be premature.
