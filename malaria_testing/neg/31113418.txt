BACKGROUND: The fight against malaria faces various biological obstacles,
including the resistance of parasites to anti-malarial drugs and the resistance
of mosquito vectors to insecticides. The resistance of Anopheles gambiae sensu
lato (s.l.) to pyrethroids, the only class of insecticides used to impregnate
mosquito nets, is known in Benin; the expansion of this resistance is influenced 
by the existence of gene flow between species, otherwise by the presence or
absence of the kdr mutation in them. The objective of this study is to determine 
the spatial distribution of An. gambiae and the level of expression of the
pyrethroid resistance kdr gene in seven agro-ecological zones of Benin.
METHODS: The study was conducted in 18 localities belonging to seven
agro-ecological zones where environmental parameters varied. The sites represent 
the main areas of eco-epidemiological malaria in Benin. Anopheles gambiae larvae 
were collected in natural breeding sites using ladles and dipping method and
reared under standard conditions. These larvae were reared under standard
conditions of temperature and humidity (26 to 30 °C and 60 to 90%) at the
insectarium of the Centre de Recherche Entomologique de Cotonou (CREC). Adult
female mosquitoes having emerged are morphologically and molecularly identified. 
Homozygous resistant (1014F/1014F), homozygous sensitive (1014L/1014L) and
heterozygous (1014F/1014L) genotypes of the L1014F kdr gene mutation are
determined by PCR.
RESULTS: A total of 677 An. gambiae was subjected at the PCR. The results
revealed the presence of three vector species of the An. gambiae complex, of
which 409 Anopheles coluzzii, 259 An. gambiae, 5 hybrids (An. coluzzii/An.
gambiae) and 4 Anopheles arabiensis in the different agro-ecological zones. The
four An. arabiensis were only found in Dassa, a locality in the cotton zone of
central Benin. The frequency of distribution of the L1014F allele of the kdr gene
varies from 84.48 to 100% in An. gambiae, from 80 to 100% in An. coluzzii and
from 0 to 75% in An. arabiensis in the different agro-ecological zones. Moreover,
a significant difference is generally observed in the distribution of the L1014F 
allele (P < 0.05). By comparing in pairs the distribution frequencies of this
allele in the two species by agro-ecological zone, only a significant difference 
is noted in the central cotton and fishery zones (P = 0.0496).
CONCLUSION: In summary, even if the data are in small portions, the An.
Arabiensis species was found only in central Benin and the L1014F allele of the
kdr gene is widespread and seems to fix in all the species recorded in the
different agro-ecological zones. This situation amplifies the problem of
resistance, which could eventually be a significant obstacle for the malaria
vectors control. Similarly, a study of their genetic structure via the L1014F
allele is necessary in order to put in place strategies to manage this
resistance. These strategies will take into account both the ecology and the
genetic diversity of the organisms involved to preserve the effectiveness of
pyrethroids, the only insecticides used for the impregnation of mosquito nets.
