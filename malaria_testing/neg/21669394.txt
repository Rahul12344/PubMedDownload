While subunit vaccines have shown partial efficacy in clinical trials,
radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS) remain the "gold standard" for sterilizing
protection against Plasmodium infection in human vaccinees. The variability in
immunogenicity and replication introduced by the extensive, random DNA damage
necessary to generate RAS could be overcome by genetically attenuated parasites
(GAP) designed via gene deletion to arrest at defined points during liver-stage
development. Here, we demonstrate the principle that late liver stage-arresting
GAP induce larger and broader CD8 T cell responses that provide superior
protection in inbred and outbred mice compared to RAS or early-arresting GAP
immunizations. Late liver stage-arresting GAP also engender high levels of
cross-stage and cross-species protection and complete protection when
administered by translationally relevant intradermal or subcutaneous routes.
Collectively, our results underscore the potential utility of late liver
stage-arresting GAP as broadly protective next-generation live-attenuated malaria
vaccines and support their potential as a powerful model for identifying antigens
to generate cross-stage protection.
