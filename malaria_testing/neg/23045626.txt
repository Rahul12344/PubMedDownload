BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) adhere to host cell
receptors, allowing parasites to sequester into deep vascular beds of various
organs. This defining phenomenon of malaria pathogenesis is key to the severe
clinical complications associated with cerebral and placental malaria. The
principal ligand associated with the binding to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) that 
allows placental sequestration of IEs is a P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane
protein 1 (PfEMP1) family member encoded by the var2csa gene.
METHODS: Here, we investigated the transcription pattern of var genes by
real-time polymerase chain reaction, the expression of VAR2CSA, protein by flow
cytometry, and the CSA-binding ability of IEs collected at different stages of
pregnancy using a static-based Petri dish assay.
RESULTS: Through comparison with the profiles of isolates from nonpregnant hosts,
we report several lines of evidence showing that parasites infecting women during
pregnancy preferentially express VAR2CSA protein, and that selection for the
capacity to adhere to CSA via VAR2CSA expression occurs early in pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the placental tropism of P. falciparum is
already established in the first trimester of pregnancy, with consequent
implications for the development of the pathology associated with placental
malaria.
