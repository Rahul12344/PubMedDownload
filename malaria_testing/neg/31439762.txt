Malaria parasites adopt a remarkable variety of morphological life stages as they
transition through multiple mammalian host and mosquito vector environments. We
profiled the single-cell transcriptomes of thousands of individual parasites,
deriving the first high-resolution transcriptional atlas of the entire Plasmodium
berghei life cycle. We then used our atlas to precisely define developmental
stages of single cells from three different human malaria parasite species,
including parasites isolated directly from infected individuals. The Malaria Cell
Atlas provides both a comprehensive view of gene usage in a eukaryotic parasite
and an open-access reference dataset for the study of malaria parasites.
