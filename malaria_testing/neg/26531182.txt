The proteins of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, are strikingly rich in
asparagine. Plasmodium depends primarily on host haemoglobin degradation for
amino acids and has a rudimentary pathway for amino acid biosynthesis, but
retains a gene encoding asparagine synthetase (AS). Here we show that deletion of
AS in Plasmodium berghei (Pb) delays the asexual- and liver-stage development
with substantial reduction in the formation of ookinetes, oocysts and sporozoites
in mosquitoes. In the absence of asparagine synthesis, extracellular asparagine
supports suboptimal survival of PbAS knockout (KO) parasites. Depletion of blood 
asparagine levels by treating PbASKO-infected mice with asparaginase completely
prevents the development of liver stages, exflagellation of male gametocytes and 
the subsequent formation of sexual stages. In vivo supplementation of asparagine 
in mice restores the exflagellation of PbASKO parasites. Thus, the parasite life 
cycle has an absolute requirement for asparagine, which we propose could be
targeted to prevent malaria transmission and liver infections.
