Although RTS,S remains the most advanced malaria vaccine, the factors influencing
differences in vaccine immunogenicity or efficacy between individuals or
populations are still poorly characterised. The analyses of genetic determinants 
of immunogenicity have previously been restricted by relatively small sample
sizes from individual trials. Here we combine data from six Phase II RTS,S trials
and evaluate the relationship between HLA allele groups and RTS,S-mediated
protection in controlled human malaria infections (CHMI), using multivariate
logistic or linear regression. We observed significant associations between three
allele groups (HLA-A∗01, HLA-B∗08, and HLA-DRB1∗15/∗16) and protection, while
another three allele groups (HLA-A∗03, HLA-B∗53, and HLA-DRB1∗07) were
significantly associated with lack of protection. It is noteworthy that these
'protective' allele groups are thought to be at a lower prevalence in sub-Saharan
African populations than in the UK or USA where these Phase II trials occurred.
Taken together, the analyses presented here give an indication that HLA genotype 
may influence RTS,S-mediated protective efficacy against malaria infection.
