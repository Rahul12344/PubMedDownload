Alveolar echinococcosis is a worldwide zoonosis of great public health concern.
Analysis of genome data for Echinococcus multilocularis has identified antigen
families that can be used in diagnostic assays and vaccine development. However, 
little gene expression data is available for antigens of the egg and early larval
stages. To address this information gap, we used a Next-Generation Sequencing
approach to investigate three different stages (non-activated and activated
oncospheres, and early stage metacestodes) of E. multilocularis (Nemuro strain). 
Transcriptome data analysis revealed that some diagnostic antigen gp50 isoforms
and the antigen Eg95 family dominated in activated oncospheres, and the antigen B
family dominated in early stage metacestodes. Furthermore, heat shock proteins
and antigen II/3 are constantly expressed in the three stages. The expression
pattern of various known antigens in E. multilocularis may give fundamental
information for choosing candidate genes used in diagnosis and vaccine
development.
