Case reports from Johan Czermak, Marc Ruffer, and others a century or more ago
demonstrated ancient Egyptians had atherosclerosis three millennia ago. The Horus
study team extended their findings, demonstrating that atherosclerosis was
prevalent among 76 ancient Egyptian mummies and among 61 mummies from each of the
ancient cultures of Peru, the American Southwest, and the Aleutian Islands. These
findings challenge the assumption that atherosclerosis is a modern disease caused
by present day risk factors. An extensive autopsy of an ancient Egyptian teenage 
male weaver named Nakht found that he was infected with four parasites:
Schistosoma haematobium, Taenia species, Trichinella spiralis, and Plasmodium
falciparum. Modern day patients with chronic inflammatory disease such as
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and human immunodeficiency
virus experience premature atherosclerosis. Could the burden of chronic
inflammatory disease have been a risk factor for atherosclerosis in these ancient
cultures? The prevalence of atherosclerosis in four diverse ancient cultures is
consistent with atherosclerosis being fundamental to aging. The impact of risk
factors in modern times, and potentially in ancient times, suggests a strong
gene-environmental interplay: human genes provide a vulnerability to
atherosclerosis, the environment determines when and if atherosclerosis becomes
manifest clinically.
