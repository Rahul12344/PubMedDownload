BACKGROUND: Triatoma infestans is the main vector of Chagas disease in South
America. As in all hematophagous arthropods, its saliva contains a complex
cocktail that assists blood feeding by preventing platelet aggregation and blood 
clotting and promoting vasodilation. These salivary components can be
immunologically recognized by their vector's hosts and targeted with antibodies
that might disrupt blood feeding. These antibodies can be used to detect vector
exposure using immunoassays. Antibodies may also contribute to the fast evolution
of the salivary cocktail.
METHODOLOGY: Salivary gland cDNA libraries from nymphal and adult T. infestans of
breeding colonies originating from different locations (Argentina, Chile, Peru
and Bolivia), and cDNA libraries originating from F1 populations of Bolivia, were
sequenced using Illumina technology. Coding sequences (CDS) were extracted from
the assembled reads, the numbers of reads mapped to these CDS, sequences were
functionally annotated and polymorphisms determined.
MAIN FINDINGS/SIGNIFICANCE: Over five thousand CDS, mostly full length or near
full length, were publicly deposited on GenBank. Transcripts that were over
10-fold overexpressed from different geographical regions, or from different
developmental stages were identified. Polymorphisms were mapped to derived coding
sequences, and found to vary between developmental instars and geographic origin 
of the biological material. This expanded sialome database from T. infestans
should be of assistance in future proteomic work attempting to identify salivary 
proteins that might be used as epidemiological markers of vector exposure, or
proteins of pharmacological interest.
