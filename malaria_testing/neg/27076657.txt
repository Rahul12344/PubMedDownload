Human sapovirus has been shown to be one of the most important etiologies in
pediatric patients with acute diarrhea. However, very limited data are available 
about the causative roles and epidemiology of sapovirus in community settings. A 
nested matched case-control study within a birth cohort study of acute diarrhea
in a peri-urban community in Peru from 2007 to 2010 was conducted to investigate 
the attributable fraction (AF) and genetic diversity of sapovirus. By
quantitative reverse transcription-real-time PCR (qPCR) sapovirus was detected in
12.4% (37/299) of diarrheal and 5.7% (17/300) of nondiarrheal stools (P = 0.004).
The sapovirus AF (7.1%) was higher in the second year (13.2%) than in the first
year (1.4%) of life of children. Ten known genotypes and one novel cluster (n =
5) within four genogroups (GI, GII, GIV, and GV) were identified by phylogenetic 
analysis of a partial VP1 gene. Further sequence analysis of the full VP1 gene
revealed a possible novel genotype, tentatively named GII.8. Notably, symptomatic
reinfections with different genotypes within the same (n = 3) or different (n =
5) genogroups were observed in eight children. Sapovirus exhibited a high
attributable burden for acute gastroenteritis, especially in the second year of
life, of children in a Peruvian community. Further large-scale studies are needed
to understand better the global burden, genetic diversity, and repeated
infections of sapovirus.
