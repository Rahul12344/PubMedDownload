The transmission-blocking vaccine candidate Pfs48/45 from the human malaria
parasite Plasmodium falciparum is known to be difficult to express in
heterologous systems, either as full-length protein or as correctly folded
protein fragments that retain conformational epitopes. In this study we express
full-length Pfs48/45 in the rodent parasite P. berghei. Pfs48/45 is expressed as 
a transgene under control of the strong P. berghei schizont-specific msp1 gene
promoter (Pfs48/45@PbMSP1). Pfs48/45@PbMSP1 schizont-infected red blood cells
produced full-length Pfs48/45 and the structural integrity of Pfs48/45 was
confirmed using a panel of conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind 
to different Pfs48/45 epitopes. Sera from mice immunized with transgenic
Pfs48/45@PbMSP1 schizonts showed strong transmission-reducing activity in
mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum using standard membrane feeding. These
results demonstrate that transgenic rodent malaria parasites expressing human
malaria antigens may be used as means to evaluate immunogenicity and
functionality of difficult to express malaria vaccine candidate antigens.
