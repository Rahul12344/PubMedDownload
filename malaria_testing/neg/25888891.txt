BACKGROUND: Hainan Province is one of the most severe endemic regions with high
transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax in China. However, the
incidence of P. falciparum and P. vivax has dropped dramatically since 2007 and a
national elimination malaria programme (NEMP) was launched after 2010. To better 
understand the genetic information on P. vivax population before elimination of
malaria in Hainan Province, the extent of genetic diversity of P. vivax isolates 
in Hainan Province was investigated using four polymorphic genetic markers,
including P. vivax merozoite surface proteins 1, 3α, and 3β (pvmsp-1, pvmsp-3α,
and pvmsp-3β) and circumsporozoite protein (pvcsp).
METHODS: Isolates of P. vivax (n = 27) from Hainan Province were collected from
2009 to 2010 and pvmsp-1 and pvcsp were analysed by DNA sequencing, respectively.
Using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism were
analysed in pvmsp-3α, and pvmsp-3β.
RESULTS: The DNA sequencing analysis on pvmsp1 revealed that there were three
allele types: Salvador-1 (Sal-1), Belem and recombinant (R) types. Among them,
Sal-1 type was a dominant strain with eight variant subtypes (88.9%), whereas R- 
(3.7%) and Belem-type strains (7.4%) had one variant subtypes, respectively. All 
the isolates carried pvcsp with VK210 type accounting for 85.2% (23/27 isolates) 
and VK247 type accounting for 14.8% (4/27). Only type A and type B alleles were
successfully amplified in pvmsp-3α gene, and a high level of polymorphism was
observed in pvmsp-3α. Considering pvmsp-3β gene, type A was the predominant type 
in 17 isolates (63%), whereas type B was dominant in only ten isolates (37%).
CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that there was high degree of genetic
diversity among P. vivax population in Hainan Province of China during the
pre-elimination stage of malaria, with 26 unique haplotypes observed among 27
samples.
