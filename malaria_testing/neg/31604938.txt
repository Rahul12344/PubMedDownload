Elucidating the genetic basis of metabolic resistance to insecticides in malaria 
vectors is crucial to prolonging the effectiveness of insecticide-based control
tools including long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Here, we show that
cis-regulatory variants of the cytochrome P450 gene, CYP6P9b, are associated with
pyrethroid resistance in the African malaria vector Anopheles funestus. A
DNA-based assay is designed to track this resistance that occurs near fixation in
southern Africa but not in West/Central Africa. Applying this assay we
demonstrate, using semi-field experimental huts, that CYP6P9b-mediated resistance
associates with reduced effectiveness of LLINs. Furthermore, we establish that
CYP6P9b combines with another P450, CYP6P9a, to additively exacerbate the reduced
efficacy of insecticide-treated nets. Double homozygote resistant mosquitoes
(RR/RR) significantly survive exposure to insecticide-treated nets and
successfully blood feed more than other genotypes. This study provides tools to
track and assess the impact of multi-gene driven metabolic resistance to
pyrethroids, helping improve resistance management.
