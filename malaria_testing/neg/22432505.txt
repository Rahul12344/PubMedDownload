Erythrocytes infected with malaria parasites have increased permeability to
diverse organic and inorganic solutes. While these permeability changes have been
known for decades, the molecular basis of transport was unknown and intensively
debated. CLAG3, a parasite protein previously thought to function in
cytoadherence, has recently been implicated in formation of the plasmodial
surface anion channel (PSAC), an unusual small conductance ion channel that
mediates uptake of most solutes. Consistent with transport studies, the clag
genes are conserved in all plasmodia but are absent from other genera. The
encoded protein is integral to the host membrane, as also predicted by
electrophysiology. An important question is whether functional channels are
formed by CLAG3 alone or through interactions with other proteins. In either
case, gene identification should advance our understanding of parasite biology
and may lead to new therapeutics.
