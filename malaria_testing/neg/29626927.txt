Chromosomal translocations have long been known for their association with
malignant transformation, particularly in hematopoietic disorders such as B-cell 
lymphomas. In addition to the physiological process of maturation, which creates 
double strand breaks in immunoglobulin gene loci, environmental factors including
the Epstein-Barr and human immunodeficiency viruses, malaria-causing parasites
(Plasmodium falciparum), and plant components (Euphorbia tirucalli latex) can
trigger a reorganization of the nuclear architecture and DNA damage that together
will facilitate the occurrence of deleterious chromosomal rearrangements.
