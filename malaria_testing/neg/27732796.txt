Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains a devastating public health problem. Recent
discoveries have shed light on the origin and evolution of Plasmodium parasites
and their interactions with their vertebrate and mosquito hosts. P. falciparum
malaria originated in Africa from a single horizontal transfer between an
infected gorilla and a human, and became global as the result of human migration.
Today, P. falciparum malaria is transmitted worldwide by more than 70 different
anopheline mosquito species. Recent studies indicate that the mosquito immune
system can be a barrier to malaria transmission and that the P. falciparum Pfs47 
gene allows the parasite to evade mosquito immune detection. Here, we review the 
origin and globalization of P. falciparum and integrate this history with
analysis of the biology, evolution, and dispersal of the main mosquito vectors.
This new perspective broadens our understanding of P. falciparum population
structure and the dispersal of important parasite genetic traits.
