The malaria parasite hijacks host erythrocytes to shield itself from the immune
system and proliferate. Red blood cell abnormalities can provide protection from 
malaria by impeding parasite invasion and growth within the cell or by
compromising the ability of parasites to avoid host clearance. Here, we describe 
2 N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mouse lines, SptbMRI26194 and SptbMRI53426 ,
containing single-point mutations in the erythrocyte membrane skeleton gene, β
spectrin (Sptb), which exhibit microcytosis but retain a relatively normal ratio 
of erythrocyte surface area to volume and are highly resistant to rodent malaria.
We propose the major factor responsible for malaria protection is the specific
clearance of mutant erythrocytes, although an enhanced clearance of uninfected
mutant erythrocytes was also observed (ie, the bystander effect). Using an in
vivo erythrocyte tracking assay, we established that this phenomenon occurs
irrespective of host environment, precluding the involvement of nonerythrocytic
cells in the resistance mechanism. Furthermore, we recapitulated this phenotype
by disrupting the interaction between ankyrin-1 and β spectrin in vivo using
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, thereby genetically validating a potential
antimalarial target. This study sheds new light on the role of β spectrin during 
Plasmodium infection and highlights how changes in the erythrocyte cytoskeleton
can substantially influence malaria susceptibility with minimal adverse
consequences for the host.
