Plasmepsins (PM), aspartic proteases of Plasmodium, comprises a family of ten
proteins that perform critical functions in Plasmodium life cycle. Except VII and
VIII, functions of the remaining plasmepsin members have been well characterized.
Here, we have generated a mutant parasite lacking PM VII in Plasmodium berghei
using reverse genetics approach. Systematic comparison of growth kinetics and
infection in both mosquito and vertebrate host revealed that PM VII depleted
mutants exhibited no defects in development and progressed normally throughout
the parasite life cycle. These studies suggest a dispensable role for PM VII in
Plasmodium berghei life cycle.
