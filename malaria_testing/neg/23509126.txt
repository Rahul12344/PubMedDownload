Plasmodium vivax accounts for an increasing fraction of malaria infections in
Thailand and Cambodia. We compared P. vivax genetic complexity and antimalarial
resistance patterns in the two countries. Use of a heteroduplex tracking assay
targeting the merozoite surface protein 1 gene revealed that vivax infections in 
both countries are frequently polyclonal (84%), with parasites that are highly
diverse (HE = 0.86) but closely related (GST = 0.18). Following a history of
different drug policies in Thailand and Cambodia, distinct patterns of
antimalarial resistance have emerged: most Cambodian isolates harbor the P. vivax
multidrug resistance gene 1 (pvmdr1) 976F mutation associated with chloroquine
resistance (89% versus 8%, P < 0.001), whereas Thai isolates more often display
increased pvmdr1 copy number (39% versus 4%, P < 0.001). Finally, genotyping of
paired isolates from individuals suspected of suffering relapse supports a
complex scheme of relapse whereby recurrence of multiple identical variants is
sometimes accompanied by the appearance of novel variants.
