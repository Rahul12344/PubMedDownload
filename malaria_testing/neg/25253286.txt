OBJECTIVES: Polymorphisms in the lysosomal transporter encoded by the pfcrt gene 
directly impact on Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to aminoquinolines. The
Lys76Thr mutation is the critical change conferring chloroquine resistance in
vitro and in vivo, but always occurs with additional non-synonymous changes in
the pfcrt coding sequence. We sought to better describe pfcrt polymorphisms
distal to codon 76.
METHODS: Small-volume samples (≤ 500 μL) of parasite-infected blood collected
directly from malaria patients presenting for treatment in Sudan and Tanzania
were immediately preserved for RNA extraction. The pfcrt locus was amplified from
cDNA preparations by nested PCR and sequenced directly to derive full-length mRNA
sequences.
RESULTS: In one of two sites in Sudan, two patients were found with an unorthodox
spliced form of pfcrt mRNA in which two exons were skipped, but it was not
possible to test for the presence of the putative protein products of these
aberrant transcripts. Genomic DNA sequencing from dried blood spots collected in 
parallel confirmed the presence of spliced pfcrt pseudogenes in a minority of
parasite isolates. Full-length cDNA from conventionally spliced mRNA molecules in
all study sites demonstrated the existence of a variety of pfcrt haplotypes in
East Africa, and thus provides evidence of intragenic recombination.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pseudogenes, although unlikely to have any direct
public health impact, may confound results obtained from simple genotyping
methods that consider only codon 76 and the adjacent residues of pfcrt.
