BACKGROUND: Plasmodium malariae is characterized by its long asymptomatic
persistence in the human host. The epidemiology of P. malariae is incompletely
understood and is hampered by the limited knowledge of genetic polymorphisms.
Previous reports from Africa have shown heterogeneity within the P. malariae
circumsporozoite protein (pmcsp) gene. However, comparative studies from Asian
countries are lacking. Here, the genetic polymorphisms in pmcsp of Asian isolates
have been characterized.
METHODS: Blood samples from 89 symptomatic P. malariae-infected patients were
collected, from Thailand (n = 43), Myanmar (n = 40), Lao PDR (n = 5), and
Bangladesh (n = 1). pmcsp was amplified using semi-nested PCR before sequencing. 
The resulting 89 pmcsp sequences were analysed together with 58 previously
published pmcsp sequences representing African countries using BioEdit, MEGA6,
and DnaSP.
RESULTS: Polymorphisms identified in pmcsp were grouped into 3 populations:
Thailand, Myanmar, and Kenya. The nucleotide diversity and the ratio of
nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) in Thailand and Myanmar were
higher compared with that in Kenya. Phylogenetic analysis showed clustering of
pmcsp sequences according to the origin of isolates (Asia vs. Africa). High
genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.404) was observed between P. malariae isolates
from Asian and African countries. Sequence analysis of pmcsp showed the presence 
of tetrapeptide repeat units of NAAG, NDAG, and NAPG in the central repeat region
of the gene. Plasmodium malariae isolates from Asian countries carried fewer
copies of NAAG compared with that from African countries. The NAPG repeat was
only observed in Asian isolates. Additional analysis of 2 T-cell epitopes, Th2R
and Th3R, showed limited heterogeneity in P. malariae populations.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable information on the genetic
polymorphisms in pmcsp isolates from Asia and advances our understanding of P.
malariae population in Asia and Africa. Polymorphisms in the central repeat
region of pmcsp showed association with the geographical origin of P. malariae
isolates and can be potentially used as a marker for genetic epidemiology of P.
malariae population.
