Toll like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in recognizing the invading
malaria parasite Plasmodium, thus genetic makeup of the exposed population can be
of utmost importance for its predisposition to malaria. In this study 264 malaria
patients from seven different eco epidemiological regions of India were genotyped
for TLR2 and TLR4 polymorphisms using DNA sequencing methods. No variation was
observed at residue positions 677 and 753 in TLR2 whereas residue positions 299
and 399 in TLR4 were highly polymorphic. The GC haplotype (Asp299Gly/Thr399Thr)
was observed at the highest frequency in populations of East Singhbhum,
Vizianagaram and North Goa and absent in Kolkata, Dakshin Kannada and Nicobar
district. All polymorphisms were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. Populations of
Kolkata, Nicobar district, Sundergarh and Dakshin Kannada were observed to be
closely related. TLR2 polymorphism was absent in the Indian population and an
overall heterogeneous pattern of TLR4 polymorphism can be attributed to genetic
drift. However it can be inferred that GC haplotype is under the process of
natural selection in the Indian population and one of the factors contributing to
its selection could be predominance of Plasmodium falciparum in these regions.
