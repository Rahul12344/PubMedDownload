A key drawback to monitoring the emergence and spread of antimalarial drug
resistance in sub-Saharan Africa is early detection and containment.
Next-generation sequencing methods offer the resolution, sensitivity, and scale
required to fill this gap by surveilling for molecular markers of drug
resistance. We performed targeted sequencing using molecular inversion probes to 
interrogate five Plasmodium falciparum genes (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhps, pfdhfr, and 
pfk13) implicated in chloroquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), and artemisinin
resistance in two sites in Ghana. A total of 803 dried blood spots from children 
aged between 6 months and 14 years presenting with uncomplicated P. falciparum
malaria at the Begoro District Hospital in Begoro and the Ewim Polyclinic in Cape
Coast, Ghana, from 2014 to 2017 were prepared on filter paper. Thirteen years
after the removal of drug pressure, chloroquine-sensitive parasite strains with
pfcrt K76 have increased nearly to fixation in Begoro, in the forest area
(prevalence = 95%), but at a lower rate in Cape Coast, in the coastal region
(prevalence = 71%, Z = -3.5, P < 0.001). In addition, pfmdr1 184F-bearing
parasites are under strong selection. The pfdhfr/pfdhps quadruple genotype ( IRNG
K), associated with SP resistance, is near saturation. Our study identified at a 
2 to 10% prevalence pfdhps 581G, which is a sulfadoxine resistance marker that
correlates with the failure of SP prophylaxis in pregnancy and which has not been
observed in Ghana. The differences in the reexpansion of chloroquine-sensitive
strains observed at the two study sites, the stronger SP resistance, and the high
prevalence of pfmdr1 184F should be further monitored to inform malaria control
strategies in Ghana.
