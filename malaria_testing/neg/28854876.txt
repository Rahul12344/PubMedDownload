BACKGROUND: Malaria control in Africa is dependent upon the use insecticides but 
intensive use of a limited number of chemicals has led to resistance in mosquito 
populations. Increased production of enzymes that detoxify insecticides is one of
the most potent resistance mechanisms. Several metabolic enzymes have been
implicated in insecticide resistance but the processes controlling their
expression have remained largely elusive.
RESULTS: Here, we show that the transcription factor Maf-S regulates expression
of multiple detoxification genes, including the key insecticide metabolisers
CYP6M2 and GSTD1 in the African malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Attenuation of 
this transcription factor through RNAi induced knockdown reduced transcript
levels of these effectors and significantly increased mortality after exposure to
the pyrethroid insecticides and DDT (permethrin: 9.2% to 19.2% (p = 0.015),
deltamethrin: 3.9% to 21.6% (p = 0.036) and DDT: 1% to 11.7% (p = <0.01), whilst 
dramatically decreasing mortality induced by the organophosphate malathion (79.6%
to 8.0% (p = <0.01)). Additional genes regulated by Maf-S were also identified
providing new insight into the role of this transcription factor in insects.
CONCLUSION: Maf-S is a key regulator of detoxification genes in Anopheles
mosquitoes. Disrupting this transcription factor has opposing effects on the
mosquito's response to different insecticide classes providing a mechanistic
explanation to the negative cross resistance that has been reported between
pyrethroids and organophosphates.
