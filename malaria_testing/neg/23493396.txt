Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe clinical complication of Plasmodium falciparum 
malaria infection and is characterized by a high fatality rate and neurological
damage. Sequestration of parasite-infected red blood cells in brain
microvasculature utilizes host- and parasite-derived adhesion molecules and is an
important factor in the development of CM. ICAM-1, an alternatively spliced
adhesion molecule, is believed to be critical on endothelial cells for infected
red blood cell sequestration in CM. Using ICAM-1 mutant mice, we found that the
full-length ICAM-1 isoform is not required for development of murine experimental
CM (ECM) and that ECM phenotype varies with the combination of ICAM-1 isoforms
expressed. Furthermore, we observed development of ECM in transgenic mice
expressing ICAM-1 only on leukocytes, indicating that endothelial cell expression
of this adhesion molecule is not required for disease pathogenesis. We propose
that ICAM-1-dependent cellular aggregation, independent of ICAM-1 expression on
the cerebral microvasculature, contributes to ECM.
