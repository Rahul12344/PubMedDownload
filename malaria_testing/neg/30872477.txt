Unlike the case in Asia and Latin America, Plasmodium vivax infections are rare
in sub-Saharan Africa due to the absence of the Duffy blood group antigen (Duffy 
antigen), the only known erythrocyte receptor for the P. vivax merozoite invasion
ligand, Duffy binding protein 1 (DBP1). However, P. vivax infections have been
documented in Duffy-negative individuals throughout Africa, suggesting that P.
vivax may use ligands other than DBP1 to invade Duffy-negative erythrocytes
through other receptors. To identify potential P. vivax ligands, we compared
parasite gene expression in Saimiri and Aotus monkey erythrocytes infected with
P. vivax Salvador I (Sal I). DBP1 binds Aotus but does not bind to Saimiri
erythrocytes; thus, P. vivax Sal I must invade Saimiri erythrocytes independent
of DBP1. Comparing RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data for late-stage infections in
Saimiri and Aotus erythrocytes when invasion ligands are expressed, we identified
genes that belong to tryptophan-rich antigen and merozoite surface protein 3
(MSP3) families that were more abundantly expressed in Saimiri infections
compared with Aotus infections. These genes may encode potential ligands
responsible for P. vivax infections of Duffy-negative Africans.
