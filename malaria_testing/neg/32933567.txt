BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is a significant cause of human malaria in
Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Only one study has been previously undertaken in
Sarawak to identify vectors of P. knowlesi, where Anopheles latens was
incriminated as the vector in Kapit, central Sarawak. A study was therefore
undertaken to identify malaria vectors in a different location in Sarawak.
METHODS: Mosquitoes found landing on humans and resting on leaves over a 5-day
period at two sites in the Lawas District of northern Sarawak were collected and 
identified. DNA samples extracted from salivary glands of Anopheles mosquitoes
were subjected to nested PCR malaria-detection assays. The small subunit
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene of Plasmodium was sequenced, and the internal
transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1
(cox1) gene of the mosquitoes were sequenced from the Plasmodium-positive samples
for phylogenetic analysis.
RESULTS: Totals of 65 anophelines and 127 culicines were collected. By PCR, 6 An.
balabacensis and 5 An. donaldi were found to have single P. knowlesi infections
while 3 other An. balabacensis had either single, double or triple infections
with P. inui, P. fieldi, P. cynomolgi and P. knowlesi. Phylogenetic analysis of
the Plasmodium SSU rRNA gene confirmed 3 An. donaldi and 3 An. balabacensis with 
single P. knowlesi infections, while 3 other An. balabacensis had two or more
Plasmodium species of P. inui, P. knowlesi, P. cynomolgi and some species of
Plasmodium that could not be conclusively identified. Phylogenies inferred from
the ITS2 and/or cox1 sequences of An. balabacensis and An. donaldi indicate that 
they are genetically indistinguishable from An. balabacensis and An. donaldi,
respectively, found in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously An. latens was identified as the vector for P. knowlesi
in Kapit, central Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and now An. balabacensis and An.
donaldi have been incriminated as vectors for zoonotic malaria in Lawas, northern
Sarawak.
