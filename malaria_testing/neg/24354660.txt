BACKGROUND: Plasmodium knowlesi is the fifth Plasmodium species that can infect
humans. The Plasmodium merozoite surface protein-1(42) (MSP-1(42)) is a potential
candidate for malaria vaccine. However, limited studies have focused on P.
knowlesi MSP-1(42).
METHODS: A ~42 kDa recombinant P. knowlesi MSP-1(42) (pkMSP-1(42)) was expressed 
using an Escherichia coli system. The purified pkMSP-1(42) was evaluated with
malaria and non-malaria human patient sera (n = 189) using Western blots and
ELISA. The immunogenicity of pkMSP-1(42) was evaluated in mouse model.
RESULTS: The purified pkMSP-1(42) had a sensitivity of 91.0% for detection of
human malaria in both assays. Specificity was 97.5 and 92.6% in Western blots and
ELISA, respectively. Levels of cytokine interferon-gamma, interleukin-2,
interleukin-4, and interleukin-10 significantly increased in
pkMSP-1(42)-immunized mice as compared to the negative control mice.
pkMSP-1(42)-raised antibody had high endpoint titres, and the IgG isotype
distribution was IgG1 > IgG2b > IgG3 > IgG2a.
CONCLUSIONS: pkMSP-1(42) was highly immunogenic and able to detect human malaria.
Hence, pkMSP-1(42) would be a useful candidate for malaria vaccine development
and seroprevalence studies.
