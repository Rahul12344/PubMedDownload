BACKGROUND: Insecticides formulated into products that target Anopheles mosquitos
have had an immense impact on reducing malaria cases in Africa. However,
resistance to currently used insecticides is spreading rapidly and there is an
urgent need for alternative public health insecticides. Potential new
insecticides must be screened against a range of characterized mosquito strains
to identify potential resistance liabilities. The Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine maintains three susceptible and four resistant Anopheles strains that
are widely used for screening for new insecticides. The properties of these
strains are described in this paper.
METHODS: WHO tube susceptibility bioassays were used for colony selection and to 
screen for resistance to the major classes of public health insecticides. Topical
and tarsal contact bioassays were used to produce dose response curves to assess 
resistance intensity. Bioassays with the synergist piperonyl butoxide were also
performed. Taqman™ assays were used to screen for known target site resistance
alleles (kdr and ace-1). RT-qPCR was used to quantify expression of genes
associated with pyrethroid resistance.
RESULTS: Pyrethroid selection pressure has maintained resistance to this class in
all four resistant strains. Some carbamate and organophosphate resistance has
been lost through lack of exposure to these insecticide classes. The Anopheles
gambiae (sensu lato) strains, VK7 2014, Banfora M and Tiassalé 13 have higher
levels of pyrethroid resistance than the An. funestus FUMOZ-R strain. Elevated
expression of P450s is found in all four strains and the 1014F kdr mutation is
present in all three An. gambiae strains at varying frequencies. Tarsal contact
data and overexpression of CYP4G16 and SAP2 suggest penetration barriers and/or
sequestration also confer resistance in Banfora M.
CONCLUSIONS: Continual selection with deltamethrin has maintained a stable
pyrethroid-resistant phenotype over many generations. In conjunction with a
standardized rearing regime, this ensures quality control of strains over time
allowing for robust product comparison and selection of optimal products for
further development. The identification of multiple mechanisms underpinning
insecticide resistance highlights the importance of screening new compounds
against a range of mosquito strains.
