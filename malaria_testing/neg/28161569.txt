BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that the PfKelch13 mutations that confer
artemisinin resistance in falciparum malaria have multiple independent origins
across the Greater Mekong subregion, which has motivated a regional malaria
elimination agenda. We aimed to use molecular genotyping to assess antimalarial
drug resistance selection and spread in the Greater Mekong subregion.
METHODS: In this observational study, we tested Plasmodium falciparum isolates
from Myanmar, northeastern Thailand, southern Laos, and western Cambodia for
PfKelch13 mutations and for Pfplasmepsin2 gene amplification (indicating
piperaquine resistance). We collected blood spots from patients with microscopy
or rapid test confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria. We used microsatellite 
genotyping to assess genetic relatedness.
FINDINGS: As part of studies on the epidemiology of artemisinin-resistant malaria
between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2015, we collected 434 isolates. In 2014-15, a
single long PfKelch13 C580Y haplotype (-50 to +31·5 kb) lineage, which emerged in
western Cambodia in 2008, was detected in 65 of 88 isolates from northeastern
Thailand, 86 of 111 isolates from southern Laos, and 14 of 14 isolates from
western Cambodia, signifying a hard transnational selective sweep. Pfplasmepsin2 
amplification occurred only within this lineage, and by 2015 these closely
related parasites were found in ten of the 14 isolates from Cambodia and 15 of 15
isolates from northeastern Thailand. C580Y mutated parasites from Myanmar had a
different genetic origin.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that the dominant artemisinin-resistant P
falciparum C580Y lineage probably arose in western Cambodia and then spread to
Thailand and Laos, outcompeting other parasites and acquiring piperaquine
resistance. The emergence and spread of fit artemisinin-resistant P falciparum
parasite lineages, which then acquire partner drug resistance across the Greater 
Mekong subregion, threatens regional malaria control and elimination goals.
Elimination of falciparum malaria from this region should be accelerated while
available antimalarial drugs still remain effective.
