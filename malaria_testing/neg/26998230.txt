In prokaryotes, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been regarded as an important 
evolutionary drive to acquire and retain beneficial genes for their survival in
diverse ecologies. However, in eukaryotes, the functional role of HGTs remains
questionable, although current genomic tools are providing increased evidence of 
acquisition of novel traits within non-mating metazoan species. Here, we provide 
another transcriptomic evidence for the acquisition of massive plant genes in the
mosquito, Anopheles culicifacies. Our multiple experimental validations including
genomic PCR, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, immuno-blotting and immuno-florescence
microscopy, confirmed that plant like transcripts (PLTs) are of mosquito origin
and may encode functional proteins. A comprehensive molecular analysis of the
PLTs and ongoing metagenomic analysis of salivary microbiome provide initial
clues that mosquitoes may have survival benefits through the acquisition of
nuclear as well as chloroplast encoded plant genes. Our findings of PLTs further 
support the similar questionable observation of HGTs in other higher organisms,
which is still a controversial and debatable issue in the community of
evolutionists. We believe future understanding of the underlying mechanism of the
feeding associated molecular responses may shed new insights in the functional
role of PLTs in the mosquito.
