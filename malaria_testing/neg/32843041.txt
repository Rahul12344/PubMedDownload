BACKGROUND: Histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP2)-based rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)
are the only RDTs recommended for malaria diagnosis in Uganda. However, the
emergence of Plasmodium falciparum histidine rich protein 2 and 3 (pfhrp2 and
pfhrp3) gene deletions threatens their usefulness as malaria diagnostic and
surveillance tools. The pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions surveillance was
conducted in P. falciparum parasite populations in Uganda.
METHODS: Three-hundred (n = 300) P. falciparum isolates collected from
cross-sectional malaria surveys in symptomatic individuals in 48 districts of
eastern and western Uganda were analysed for the presence of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3
genes. Presence of parasite DNA was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 18s
rRNA gene, msp1 and msp2 single copy genes. Presence or absence of deletions was 
confirmed by amplification of exon1 and exon2 of pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 using gene
specific PCR.
RESULTS: Overall, pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 gene deletions were detected in 29/300 (9.7%,
95% CI 6.6-13.6%) parasite isolates. The pfhrp2 gene was deleted in 10/300 (3.3%,
95% CI 1.6-6.0%) isolates, pfhrp3 in 9/300 (3.0%, 95% CI 1.4-5.6%) while both
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 were deleted in 10/300 (3.3%, 95% CI 1.6-6.0%) parasite
isolates. Proportion of pfhrp2/3 deletions was higher in the eastern 14.7% (95%
CI 9.7-20.0%) compared to the western region 3.1% (95% CI 0.8-7.7%), p = 0.001.
Geographical location was associated with gene deletions aOR 6.25 (2.02-23.55),
p = 0.003.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first large-scale survey reporting the presence of
pfhrp2/3 gene deletions in P. falciparum isolates in Uganda. Roll out of RDTs for
malaria diagnosis should take into consideration the existence of pfhrp2/3 gene
deletions particularly in areas where they were detected. Periodic pfhrp2/3
surveys are recommended to inform future decisions for deployment of alternative 
RDTs.
