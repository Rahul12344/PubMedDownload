Manipulation of the mosquito gut microbiota can lay the foundations for novel
methods for disease transmission control. Mosquito blood feeding triggers a
significant, transient increase of the gut microbiota, but little is known about 
the mechanisms by which the mosquito controls this bacterial growth whilst
limiting inflammation of the gut epithelium. Here, we investigate the gut
epithelial response to the changing microbiota load upon blood feeding in the
malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii. We show that the synthesis and integrity of
the peritrophic matrix, which physically separates the gut epithelium from its
luminal contents, is microbiota dependent. We reveal that the peritrophic matrix 
limits the growth and persistence of Enterobacteriaceae within the gut, whilst
preventing seeding of a systemic infection. Our results demonstrate that the
peritrophic matrix is a key regulator of mosquito gut homeostasis and establish
functional analogies between this and the mucus layers of the mammalian
gastrointestinal tract.
