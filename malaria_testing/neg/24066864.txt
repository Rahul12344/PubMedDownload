BACKGROUND: There are increasing evidences on the role of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) 
as key regulator of cellular homeostasis. LOC284889 is an uncharacterized ncRNA
gene on reverse strand to MIF mapped to 22q11.23. MIF, a lymphokine, regulates
innate immune response by up-regulating the expression of TLR4, suppressing the
p53 activity and has been shown to be involved in malaria pathogenesis.
METHODS: In this study, the possible effect of MIF variations on malaria
susceptibility was investigated by re-sequencing the complete MIF gene along with
1 kb each of 5' and 3' region in 425 individuals from malaria endemic regions of 
the Orissa and Chhattisgarh states of India. The subjects comprised of 160 cases 
of severe malaria, 101 of mild malaria and 164 ethnically matched asymptomatic
controls. Data were statistically compared between cases and controls for their
possible association with Plasmodium falciparum malarial outcome.
RESULTS: It is the first study, which shows that the allele A (rs34383331T > A)
in ncRNA is significantly associated with increased risk to P. falciparum malaria
[severe: OR = 2.08, p = 0.002 and mild: OR = 2.09, P = 0.005]. In addition, it
has been observed that the higher MIF-794CATT repeats (>5) increases malaria risk
(OR = 1.61, p = 0.01). Further, diplotype (MIF-794CATT and rs34383331T > A) 5 T
confers protection to severe malaria (OR = 0.55, p = 0.002) while 6A (OR = 3.07, 
p = 0.001) increases malaria risk.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the involvement of ncRNA in malarial
pathogenesis and further emphasize the complex genetic regulation of malaria
outcome. In addition, the study shows that the higher MIF-794CATT repeats (>5) is
a risk factor for severe malaria. The study would help in identifying people who 
are at higher risk to malaria and adapt strategies for prevention and treatment.
