Understanding the mechanisms of CD4 memory T cell (Tmem) differentiation in
malaria is critical for vaccine development. However, the metabolic regulation of
CD4 Tmem differentiation is not clear, particularly in persistent infections. In 
this study, we investigated the role of fatty acid synthesis (FAS) in Tmem
development in Plasmodium chabaudi chronic mouse malaria infection. We show that 
T cell-specific deletion and early pharmaceutical inhibition of acetyl CoA
carboxylase 1, the rate limiting step of FAS, inhibit generation of early memory 
precursor effector T cells (MPEC). To compare the role of FAS during early
differentiation or survival of Tmem in chronic infection, a specific inhibitor of
acetyl CoA carboxylase 1, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, was administered at
different times postinfection. Strikingly, the number of Tmem was only reduced
when FAS was inhibited during T cell priming and not during the Tmem survival
phase. FAS inhibition during priming increased effector T cell (Teff)
proliferation and strongly decreased peak parasitemia, which is consistent with
improved Teff function. Conversely, MPEC were decreased, in a T cell-intrinsic
manner, upon early FAS inhibition in chronic, but not acute, infection. Early
cure of infection also increased mitochondrial volume in Tmem compared with Teff,
supporting previous reports in acute infection. We demonstrate that the
MPEC-specific effect was due to the higher fatty acid content and synthesis in
MPEC compared with terminally differentiated Teff. In conclusion, FAS in CD4 T
cells regulates the early divergence of Tmem from Teff in chronic infection.
