It is known that there has been positive natural selection for hemoglobin S and C
in humans despite negative health effects, due to its role in malaria resistance.
However, it is not well understood, if there has been natural selection for
hemoglobin E (HbE), which is a common variant in Southeast Asia. Therefore, we
reviewed previous studies and discussed the potential role of natural selection
in the prevalence of HbE. Our review shows that in vitro studies, evolutionary
genetics studies and epidemiologic studies largely support an involvement of
natural selection in the evolution of HbE and a protective role of HbE against
malaria infection. However, the evidence is inconsistent, provided from different
regions, and insufficient to perform an aggregated analysis such as a
meta-analysis. In addition, few candidate gene, genome-wide association or
epistasis studies, which have been made possible with the use of big data in the 
post-genomic era, have investigated HbE. The biological pathways linking HbE and 
malaria infection have not yet been fully elucidated. Therefore, further research
is necessary before it can be concluded that there was positive natural selection
for HbE due to protection against malaria. Lay summary: Our review shows that
evidence largely supports an involvement of natural selection in the evolution of
HbE and a protective role of HbE against malaria. However, the evidence is not
consistent. Further research is necessary before it is concluded.
