Plasmodium vivax msp1p, a paralog of the candidate vaccine antigen P. vivax
merozoite surface protein 1, possesses a signal peptide at its N-terminus and two
epidermal growth factor-like domains at its C-terminus with a
glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment site. The msp1p gene locus may have
originated by a duplication of the msp1 gene locus in a common ancestor of the
analyzed Plasmodium species and lost from P. yoelii, P. berghei, and P.
falciparum during their evolutionary history. Full-length sequences of the msp1p 
gene were generally highly conserved; they had a few amino acid substitutions,
one highly polymorphic E/Q-rich region, and a single-to-triple hepta-peptide
repeat motif. Twenty-one distinguishable allelic types (A1-A21) of the E/Q-rich
region were identified from worldwide isolates. Among them, four types were
detected in isolates from South Korea. The length polymorphism of the E/Q-rich
region might be useful as a genetic marker for population structure studies in
malaria-endemic areas.
