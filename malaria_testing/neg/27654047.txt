BACKGROUND: Non-synonymous mutations in dhfr and dhps genes in Plasmodium vivax
are associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance. The present study 
aimed to assess the prevalence of point mutations in P. vivax dhfr (pvdhfr) and
P. vivax dhps (pvdhps) genes in three countries: Lao PDR, India and Colombia.
METHODS: Samples from 203 microscopically diagnosed vivax malaria were collected 
from the three countries. Five codons at positions 13, 57, 58, 61, and 117 of
pvdhfr and two codons at positions 383 and 553 of pvdhps were examined by
polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology.
RESULTS: The largest number of 58R/117 N double mutations in pvdhfr was observed 
in Colombia (94.3 %), while the corresponding wild-type amino acids were found at
high frequencies in Lao PDR during 2001-2004 (57.8 %). Size polymorphism analysis
of the tandem repeats within pvdhfr revealed that 74.3 % of all the isolates
carried the type B variant. Eighty-nine per cent of all the isolates examined
carried wild-type pvdhps A383 and A553.
CONCLUSIONS: Although SP is not generally used to treat P. vivax infections,
mutations in dhfr and dhps that confer antifolate resistance in P. vivax are
common. The data strongly suggest that, when used primarily to treat falciparum
malaria, SP can exert a substantial selective pressure on P. vivax populations,
and this can lead to point mutations in dhfr and dhps. Accurate data on the
global geographic distribution of dhfr and dhps genotypes should help to inform
anti-malarial drug-use policies.
