BACKGROUND: Malaria can be transmitted by blood transfusion through donations
collected from asymptomatic donors. Transfusion-transmitted malaria (TTM) poses a
great risk to blood services worldwide. A good screening tool for Plasmodium spp.
detection in blood banks must have a high sensitivity for prevention of TTM.
However, in Brazilian blood banks, screening for malaria still relies on
microscopy.
METHODS: In Brazil, screening for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV),
RNA/DNA for hepatitis C (HCV) and hepatitis B (HBV) viruses is mandatory for
every blood donation and uses nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT). The aim
of this study was to evaluate the inclusion of an assay for malaria to identify
Plasmodium sp. from total nucleic acid (TNA; DNA/RNA) by targeting the 18S rRNA
gene of the parasite.
RESULTS: Considering the limitations of microscopy and the wide availability of
the Brazilian NAT platform in the screening of blood units for HIV, HCV, and HBV,
a molecular diagnostic tool was validated for detection of Plasmodium sp. in
blood banks; a pilot study showed that using this novel NAT assay could reduce
the risk of TTM.
CONCLUSION: The prototype HIV/HCV/HBV/malaria NAT assay was effective in
detecting infected candidate donors and has good prospects to be applied in
routine screening for preventing TTM.
