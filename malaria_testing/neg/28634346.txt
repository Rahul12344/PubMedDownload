Successful establishment of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology in Plasmodium
spp. has provided a powerful tool to transform Plasmodium falciparum into a
genetically more tractable organism. Conditional gene regulation approaches are
required to study the function of gene products critical for growth and
erythrocyte invasion of blood stage parasites. Here we employ CRISPR/Cas9 to
facilitate use of the dimerisable Cre-recombinase (DiCre) that is frequently used
to mediate the excision and loss of loxP-flanked DNA sequences in a rapamycin
controlled manner. We describe novel CRISPR/Cas9 transfection plasmids and
approaches for the speedy, stable and marker-free introduction of transgenes
encoding the DiCre recombinase into genomic loci dispensable for blood stage
development. Together these plasmids form a toolkit that will allow the rapid
generation of transgenic DiCre-expressing P. falciparum lines in any genetic
background. Furthermore, the newly developed 3D7-derived parasite lines,
constitutively and stably expressing DiCre, generated using this toolkit will
prove useful for the analysis of gene products. Lastly, we introduce an improved 
treatment protocol that uses a lower rapamycin concentration and shorter
treatment times, leading to loxP-guided recombination with close to 100%
efficiency within the same replication cycle.
