BACKGROUND: Due to the effect of midgut bacteria on proliferation of parasites
and their potential as paratransgenesis tools, their identification in malaria
vector mosquitoes is important. Anopheles culicifacies s.l. is one of the main
malaria vectors in Asia; however, its midgut microbiota remains un-studied. This 
work was primarily designed to isolate potential candidates for use in a
paratransgenesis approach, but also to give a picture of the midgut microbiota of
wild-caught An. culicifacies larvae and adults from the southeast corner of Iran,
which has the highest malaria endemicity in the country.
METHODS: A total of 68 larvae and 34 adult females (newly eclosed and older) from
three different biotopes in Iran were analyzed for their midgut microflora. The
mosquitoes had their midgut bacterial contents plated on three different culture 
media (brain heart agar, nutrient agar and blood agar) yielding 57 bacterial
isolates. The 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were sequence analyzed for species
designation, which then was confirmed by biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: A total of twelve bacterial genera were identified: Acinetobacter,
Aeromonas, Bacillus, Chryseobacterium, Delftia, Exiguobacterium, Kurthia,
Microbacterium, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Thorsellia and Variovorax. In older 
females, only Gram-negative bacteria were found, whereas larvae and newly-eclosed
adults also harbored Gram-positive bacteria. The diversity of isolates also
varied between sampling sites and mosquito stages, with the largest number of
genera found in the Anguri district and in larvae, respectively. Pseudomonas was 
the most common genus retrieved from all sampling sites, and in both larvae and
adults, suggesting a potential transstadial passage of these bacteria.
Interestingly, identical 16S sequences of Pseudomonas were found in mosquitoes
originating from different habitats at least 45 km apart, which could suggest
that these bacteria have been adapted to the mosquitoes.
CONCLUSIONS: The study of vector mosquito microbiota has recently gathered
increased interest because of the potential influence on vector competence. By
adding data from a hitherto uncharacterized malaria mosquito, a better picture of
gut flora in vector mosquitoes was obtained. Furthermore, some species of the
predominant genus Pseudomonas will be evaluated for the selection of a
paratransgenesis candidate.
