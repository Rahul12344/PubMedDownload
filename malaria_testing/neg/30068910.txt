The Plasmodium life cycle within the mosquito involves the gamete, zygote, motile
ookinete, and the oocyst stage that supports sporogony and sporozoite formation. 
We mapped the P. falciparum transcriptome as the parasite progresses through the 
oocyst stage of development on days 2, 4, 6, and 8 post-P. falciparum infectious 
blood meal. Through these genomic studies, we identified 212 novel transmission
stage biomarkers including genes that are developmentally expressed at a single
time point and genes that are pan-developmentally expressed at all four time
points in P. falciparum oocysts. Validation of a small subset of genes at the
transcriptional and translational level resulted in identification of a signature
of genes/proteins that can detect parasites within the mosquito as early as day 2
post-infectious blood meal and can be used to distinguish early versus late stage
P. falciparum oocyst development in the mosquito. Currently, circumsporozoite
protein (CSP), which is detectable only after day 7 post-infection, is the only
marker used for detection of P. falciparum infection in mosquitoes. Our results
open the prospect to develop a non-CSP based detection assay for assessment of P.
falciparum infection in mosquitoes and evaluate the effect of intervention
measures on malaria transmission in an endemic setting.
