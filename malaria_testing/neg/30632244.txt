The protozoan parasite Plasmodium has evolved to survive in different hosts and
environments. The diverse strategies of adaptation to different niches involve
differential gene expression mechanisms mediated by chromatin plasticity that are
poorly characterized in Plasmodium. The parasite employs a wide variety of
regulatory mechanisms to complete their life cycle and survive inside hosts.
Among them, epigenetic-mediated mechanisms have been implicated for controlling
chromatin organization, gene regulation, morphological differentiation, and
antigenic variation. The differential gene expression in parasite is largely
dependent on the nature of the chromatin structure. The histone core methylation 
marks and methyl mark readers contribute to chromatin dynamics. Here, we review
the recent developments on various epigenetic marks and its enzymes in the
Plasmodium falciparum, how these marks play a key role in the regulation of
transcriptional activity of variable genes and coordinate the differential gene
expression. We also discuss the possible roles of these epigenetic marks in
chromatin structure regulation and plasticity at various stages of its
development.
