Children under the age of five years old face significant mortality risks around 
the world. Public health innovations, particularly gene-editing technologies such
as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could help 
to reduce the risk of death in children under the age of five years old. For
example, CRISPR-based strategies could reduce infectious disease morbidity by
gene editing mosquitoes to prevent transmission of malaria. CRISPR gene editing
technology could also help to screen for influenza virus and prevent it from
replicating; influenza is a particularly difficult to treat and severe virus
causing many deaths in children. The lack of liver, kidney, and heart donations
for children on the organ donation waiting list could also benefit from CRISPR.
Gene editing of pigs to reduce rejection rates and associated risks of porcine
endogenous retroviruses could allow for the utilization of pig organs for
transplant. Here we review proposed applications of gene-editing technology in
public health and discuss its potential to reduce child mortality and morbidity
globally.
