AIM: The association of transporters gene polymorphisms with
chloroquine/primaquine malaria treatment response was investigated in a Brazilian
population.
PATIENTS & METHODS: Totally, 164 Plasmodium vivax malaria infected patients were 
included. Generalized estimating equations were performed to determine gene
influences on parasitemia and/or gametocytemia clearance over treatment time.
RESULTS: Significant interaction between SLCO2B1 genotypes and treatment over
time for parasitemia clearance rate on day 2 were observed (p FDR = 0.002).
SLCO1A2 and SLCO1B1 gene treatment over time interactions were associated with
gametocytemia clearance rate (p FDR = 0.018 and p FDR = 0.024). ABCB1, ABCC4 and 
SLCO1B3 were not associated with treatment response.
CONCLUSION: The present work presents the first pharmacogenetic report of an
association between chloroquine/primaquine responses with OATP transporters.
