Ammonia is one of the principal kairomones originating from human and other
animal emanations and in that context, plays an essential role in the
host-seeking behaviors of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambiae.
Nevertheless, despite its importance in directing host-seeking, the mechanisms
underlying ammonia detection in the mosquito olfactory system remains largely
unknown. In addition to ongoing efforts to identify and characterize the
molecular receptors that underlie ammonia sensitivity, previous studies have
revealed a prominent role for ammonium transporters (Amt) in modulating antennal 
and behavioral responses in Drosophila melanogaster and An. gambiae. In the
former, localization of DmAmt in antennal sensilla to auxiliary cells surrounding
the ammonia sensory neurons led to the hypothesis that its role was to clear
excess ammonium ions in the sensillar lymph. In the latter, RT-PCR and
heterologous expression have been used to examine the expression and functional
characteristics of the An. gambiae ammonium transporter, AgAmt. We now employ
advanced transgenic tools to comprehensively examine AgAmt spatial localization
across the peripheral chemosensory appendages in larvae and adult female An.
gambiae. In the larval antennae, AgAmt appears localized in both neuronal and
auxiliary cells. In contrast to D. melanogaster, in the adult antennae,
AgAmt-derived signals are observed in both non-neuronal auxiliary cells and in
sensory neurons in ammonia-responsive basiconic and coeloconic sensilla. In the
maxillary palps, labella, and tarsi, AgAmt appears restricted to sensory neurons.
We have also characterized the responses to ammonia of adult antennal coeloconic 
sensilla and maxillary palp capitate pegs revealing a correlation between
sensillar AgAmt expression and ammonia sensitivity. Taken together, these data
suggest that AgAmt may play heterogeneous roles in the adult and larval
chemosensory apparatus and potentially broad utility as a supra-receptor target
in mosquito control.
