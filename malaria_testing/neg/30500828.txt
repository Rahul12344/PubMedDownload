The discovery of the life-threatening zoonotic infection Plasmodium knowlesi has 
added to the challenges of prompt and accurate malaria diagnosis and
surveillance. In this study from Aceh Province, Indonesia, a malaria elimination 
setting where P. knowlesi endemicity was not previously known, we report the
laboratory investigation and difficulties encountered when using molecular
detection methods for quality assurance of microscopically identified clinical
cases. From 2014 to 2015, 20 (49%) P. falciparum, 16 (39%) P. vivax, 3 (7%) P.
malariae, and 2 (5%) indeterminate species were identified by microscopy from
four sentinel health facilities. At a provincial-level reference laboratory,
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a field-friendly molecular method,
was performed and confirmed Plasmodium in all samples though further
species-identification was limited by the unavailability of non-falciparum
species-specific testing with the platform used. At a national reference
laboratory, several molecular methods including nested PCR (nPCR) targeting the
18 small sub-unit (18S) ribosomal RNA, nPCR targeting the cytochrome-b (cytb)
gene, a P. knowlesi-specific nPCR, and finally sequencing, were necessary to
ultimately classify the samples as: 19 (46%) P. knowlesi, 8 (20%) P. falciparum, 
14 (34%) P. vivax. Microscopy was unable to identify or mis-classified up to 56% 
of confirmed cases, including all cases of P. knowlesi. With the nPCR methods
targeting the four human-only species, P. knowlesi was missed (18S rRNA method)
or showed cross-reactivity for P. vivax (cytb method). To facilitate diagnosis
and management of potentially fatal P. knowlesi infection and surveillance for
elimination of human-only malaria in Indonesia and other affected settings, new
detection methods are needed for testing at the point-of-care and in local
reference laboratories.
