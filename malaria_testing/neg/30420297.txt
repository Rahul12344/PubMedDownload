BACKGROUND: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a crucial risk factor for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the mechanism for its elevated activation
level in NPC endemic areas remains unclear. This study aims to identify the EBV
natural variations contributed to the different reactivation potential between
NPC endemic and non-endemic areas.
METHODS: 1030 subjects were recruited in China, including 303 healthy individuals
from two NPC non-endemic areas, 483 healthy people from three endemic areas and
244 NPC patients. Among which, saliva DNA samples from 244 participants were
sequenced for the EBV immediate early (IE) genes of BRLF1 and BZLF1, their
promoters were included; the rest 786 subjects were used for the validation of
significant variations among three different populations. Haplotype and
population structure analysis were conducted. Dual-luciferase assay was used to
detect the promoter activity.
RESULTS: A total of 246 distinct variations were detected, 29 showed significant 
difference in the frequencies between healthy people from NPC endemic area and
non-endemic area. Population structure analysis clustered EBV strains into 9
subgroups mostly in accordance with the geographical origin of samples.
Interestingly, two EBV genotypes, Rp-V1 and Rp-V2, were identified according to
the linkage relationship of the variations in BRLF1 promoter (Rp). Rp-V1 has
higher frequency in NPC endemic areas than in non-endemic areas (52.38% vs
18.15%, P = 2.07 × 10-14), and was associated with higher oral EBV DNA levels
(adjusted OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.21-2.24, P = .002), suggesting a more powerful
activation ability of Rp-V1 than that of the prototype Rp-of the EBV strain; On
the contrary, Rp-V2 has higher frequency in NPC non-endemic areas than in endemic
areas (18.48% vs 0.38%, P = 1.17 × 10-7), might represent a reduced activation
potential of EBV. Further dual-luciferase assay showed Rp-V1 has higher promoter 
activity while compared with Rp-V2 (P < .0001). Notably, Rp-V1 impaired the
transcription repression effect of YY1 while Rp-V2 strengthened the transcription
repression effect of EBF1 on Rp. In addition, significant differences of Rta
393-407 CTL epitope which may influence the recognition of Rta by CD8+ T cells
were detected between healthy people from NPC endemic area and non-endemic area.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified natural variations in cis-acting elements (YY1
and EBF1) of EBV Rp altering Rp transcription activities, which may contribute to
the elevated EBV activation level in NPC endemic areas than non-endemic areas.
