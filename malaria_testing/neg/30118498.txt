OBJECTIVE: We assessed the association of mutant allele frequencies of nitric
oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) gene at two SNPs (-954 and -1173) with malaria disease
severity in children from a malaria endemic area in Southern Ghana.
METHOD: Using children recruited at the hospital, assigned into clinical
subgroups of uncomplicated and severe malaria and matching with their "healthy
control" counterparts, we designed a case control study. Genomic DNA was
extracted and genotyping using Restriction Fragment Polymorphism was done.
RESULT: A total of 123 malaria cases (91 uncomplicated, 32 severe) and 100
controls were sampled. Their corresponding mean Hbs were 9.6, 9.3 and 11.2g/dl
and geometric mean parasite densities of 32097, 193252 and 0 parasites/ml
respectively. Variant allele frequencies varied from 0.09 through 0.03 to 0.12
for G-954C and 0.06 through 0.03 to 0.07 for C-1173T in the uncomplicated, severe
and healthy control groups respectively. There was a strong linkage
disequilibrium between the two alleles (p<0.001). For the -954 position, the odds
of developing severe malaria was found to be 2.5 times lower with the carriage of
a C allele compared to those without severe malaria (Ï‡2; p< 0.05) though this
isn't the case with -1173.
CONCLUSION: The carriage of a mutant allele in the -954 NOS2 gene may have a
protective effect on malaria among Southern Ghanaian children.
