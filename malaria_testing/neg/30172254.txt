BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, and pre-term birth are major
adverse pregnancy outcomes. These complications are considerable contributors to 
fetal/maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. A significant proportion of
these cases are thought to be due to dysfunction of the placenta. However, the
underlying mechanisms of placental dysfunction are unclear. The aim of the
present study was to investigate whether adverse pregnancy outcomes are
associated with evidence of placental eukaryotic infection.
RESULTS: We modified the 18S Illumina Amplicon Protocol of the Earth Microbiome
Project and made it capable of detecting just a single spiked-in genome copy of
Plasmodium falciparum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or Toxoplasma gondii among more 
than 70,000 human cells. Using this method, we were unable to detect eukaryotic
pathogens in placental biopsies in instances of adverse pregnancy outcome
(n = 199) or in healthy controls (n = 99).
CONCLUSIONS: Eukaryotic infection of the placenta is not an underlying cause of
the aforementioned pregnancy complications. Possible clinical applications for
this non-targeted, yet extremely sensitive, eukaryotic screening method are
manifest.
