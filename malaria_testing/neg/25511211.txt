BACKGROUND: The emergence of antimalarial drug resistance malaria parasite is
widespread in North eastern region of India. During January 2012-December 2013,
we conducted active surveillance for detection of antifolate
resistance-associated genetic polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum malaria
parasite from different malaria endemic areas of Assam.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 281 field samples were collected from suspected
malaria patients of which 106 malaria P. falciparum positive cases were detected 
in microscopic slide examination. A nested PCR was done for amplification of a
648 bp portion of the dhfr gene and 710 bp portion of the dhps gene.
RESULTS: Mutation analysis revealed existence of three different haplotypes of
the P. falciparum dhfr gene of which ANRNI was highly prevalent (90%). Triple
mutant haplotypes AIRNI (N51I+C59R+S108N) of the dhfr gene associated with
pyrimethamine resistance were prevalent in Chirang district of Assam. Whereas,
dhps mutation study revealed that triple mutant haplotype AGEAA
(S436A+A437G+K540E) associated with Sulphadoxine resistance was found among 26%
of P. falciparum field isolates. However, P. falciparum dhfr-dhps two locus
mutation analysis showed that there were a total of nine dhfr-dhps genotypes.
CONCLUSION: It was noticed that 93.62% (88/94) isolates had mutations in the
sequences of both enzymes, which is an indication of prevalence of high grade of 
Sulphadoxine - pyrimethamine resistance in P. falciparum malaria parasites in
Assam.
