BACKGROUND: De novo reference assemblies that are affordable, practical to
produce, and of sufficient quality for most downstream applications, remain an
unattained goal for many taxa. Insects, which may yield too little DNA from
individual specimens for long-read sequencing library construction and often have
highly heterozygous genomes, can be particularly hard to assemble using
inexpensive short-read sequencing data. The large number of insect species with
medical or economic importance makes this a critical problem to address.
RESULTS: Using the assembler DISCOVAR de novo, we assembled the genome of the
African malaria mosquito Anopheles arabiensis using 250 bp reads from a single
library. The resulting assembly had a contig N50 of 22,433 bp, and recovered the 
gene set nearly as well as the ALLPATHS-LG AaraD1 An. arabiensis assembly
produced with reads from three sequencing libraries and much greater resources.
DISCOVAR de novo appeared to perform better than ALLPATHS-LG in regions of low
complexity.
CONCLUSIONS: DISCOVAR de novo performed well assembling the genome of an insect
of medical importance, using simpler sequencing input than previous anopheline
assemblies. We have shown that this program is a viable tool for cost-effective
assembly of a modestly-sized insect genome.
