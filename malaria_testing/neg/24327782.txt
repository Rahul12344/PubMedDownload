In contrast to the gradual reduction in the number of locally transmitted malaria
cases in China, the number of imported malaria cases has been increasing since
2008. Here, we report a case of a 39-year-old Chinese man who acquired Plasmodium
ovale wallikeri infection while staying in Ghana, West Africa for 6 months in
2012. Microscopic examinations of Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood smears
indicated Plasmodium vivax infection. However, the results of rapid diagnostic
tests, which were conducted 3 times, were not in agreement with P. vivax. To
further check the diagnosis, standard PCR analysis of the small-subunit rRNA gene
was conducted, based on which a phylogeny tree was constructed. The results of
gene sequencing indicated that this malaria is a variant of P. ovale (P. ovale
wallikeri). The infection in this patient was not a new infection, but a relapse 
of the infection from the one that he had contracted in West Africa.
