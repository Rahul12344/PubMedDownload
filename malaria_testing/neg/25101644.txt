Traditional genetic association studies are very difficult in bacteria, as the
generally limited recombination leads to large linked haplotype blocks,
confounding the identification of causative variants. Beta-lactam antibiotic
resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae arises readily as the bacteria can quickly
incorporate DNA fragments encompassing variants that make the transformed strains
resistant. However, the causative mutations themselves are embedded within larger
recombined blocks, and previous studies have only analysed a limited number of
isolates, leading to the description of "mosaic genes" as being responsible for
resistance. By comparing a large number of genomes of beta-lactam susceptible and
non-susceptible strains, the high frequency of recombination should break up
these haplotype blocks and allow the use of genetic association approaches to
identify individual causative variants. Here, we performed a genome-wide
association study to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels
that could confer beta-lactam non-susceptibility using 3,085 Thai and 616 USA
pneumococcal isolates as independent datasets for the variant discovery. The
large sample sizes allowed us to narrow the source of beta-lactam
non-susceptibility from long recombinant fragments down to much smaller loci
comprised of discrete or linked SNPs. While some loci appear to be universal
resistance determinants, contributing equally to non-susceptibility for at least 
two classes of beta-lactam antibiotics, some play a larger role in resistance to 
particular antibiotics. All of the identified loci have a highly non-uniform
distribution in the populations. They are enriched not only in vaccine-targeted, 
but also non-vaccine-targeted lineages, which may raise clinical concerns.
Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms underlying resistance will be
essential for future use of genome sequencing to predict antibiotic sensitivity
in clinical microbiology.
