Development of a subunit vaccine targeting liver-stage Plasmodium parasites
requires the identification of antigens capable of inducing protective T cell
responses. However, traditional methods of antigen identification are incapable
of evaluating T cell responses against large numbers of proteins expressed by
these parasites. This bottleneck has limited development of subunit vaccines
against Plasmodium and other complex intracellular pathogens. To address this
bottleneck, we are developing a synthetic minigene technology for multi-antigen
DNA vaccines. In an initial test of this approach, pools of long (150 bp)
antigen-encoding oligonucleotides were synthesized and recombined into vectors by
ligation-independent cloning to produce two DNA minigene library vaccines. Each
vaccine encoded peptides derived from 36 (vaccine 1) and 53 (vaccine 2) secreted 
or transmembrane pre-erythrocytic P. yoelii proteins. BALB/cj mice were
vaccinated three times with a single vaccine by biolistic particle delivery (gene
gun) and screened for interferon-γ-producing T cell responses by ELISPOT. Library
vaccination induced responses against four novel antigens. Naïve mice exposed to 
radiation-attenuated sporozoites mounted a response against only one of the four 
novel targets (PyMDH, malate dehydrogenase). The response to PyMDH could not be
recalled by additional homologous sporozoite immunizations but could be partially
recalled by heterologous cross-species sporozoite exposure. Vaccination against
the dominant PyMDH epitope by DNA priming and recombinant Listeria boosting did
not protect against sporozoite challenge. Improvements in library design and
delivery, combined with methods promoting an increase in screening sensitivity,
may enable complex minigene screening to serve as a high-throughput system for
discovery of novel T cell antigens.
