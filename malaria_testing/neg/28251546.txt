Malaria has been present since ancient time and remains a major global health
problem in developing countries. Plasmodium falciparum belongs to the phylum
Apicomplexan, largely contain disease-causing parasites and characterized by the 
presence of apicoplast. It is a very essential organelle of P. falciparum
responsible for the synthesis of key molecules required for the growth of the
parasite. Indispensable nature of apicoplast makes it a potential drug target.
Calcium signaling is important in the establishment of malaria parasite inside
the host. It has been involved in invasion and egress of merozoites during the
asexual life cycle of the parasite. Calcium signaling also regulates apicoplast
metabolism. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the role of apicoplast in
malaria biology and its metabolic regulation through Ca++ signaling.
