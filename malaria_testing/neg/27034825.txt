Anemia is the primary clinical manifestation of malarial infections and is
responsible for the substantial rate of morbidity. The pathophysiology discussed 
till now catalogued several causes for malarial anemia among which ineffective
erythropoiesis being remarkable one occurs silently in the bone marrow. A
systematic literature search was performed and summarized information on
erythropoietic response upon malaria infection and the factors responsible for
the same. This review summarizes the clinical and experimental studies on
patients, mouse models, and in vitro cell cultures reporting erythropoietic
changes upon malaria infection as well as factors accountable for the same.
Inadequate erythropoietic response during malaria infection may be the collective
effect of various mediators generated by host immune response as well as parasite
metabolites. The interplay between various modulators causing the pathophysiology
needs to be explored further. Globin gene expression profiling upon malaria
infection should also be looked into as abnormal production of globin chains
could be a possible contributor to ineffective erythropoiesis.
