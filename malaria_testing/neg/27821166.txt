BACKGROUND: Artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum has emerged as a
major threat for malaria control and elimination worldwide. Mutations in the
Kelch propeller domain of PfK13 are the only known molecular markers for
artemisinin resistance in this parasite. Over 100 non-synonymous mutations have
been identified in PfK13 from various malaria endemic regions. This study aimed
to investigate the genetic diversity of PvK12, the Plasmodium vivax ortholog of
PfK13, in parasite populations from Southeast Asia, where artemisinin resistance 
in P. falciparum has emerged.
METHODS: The PvK12 sequences in 120 P. vivax isolates collected from Thailand
(22), Myanmar (32) and China (66) between 2004 and 2008 were obtained and 353
PvK12 sequences from worldwide populations were retrieved for further analysis.
RESULTS: These PvK12 sequences revealed a very low level of genetic diversity
(π = 0.00003) with only three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of these
three SNPs, only G581R is nonsynonymous. The synonymous mutation S88S is present 
in 3% (1/32) of the Myanmar samples, while G704G and G581R are present in 1.5%
(1/66) and 3% (2/66) of the samples from China, respectively. None of the
mutations observed in the P. vivax samples were associated with artemisinin
resistance in P. falciparum. Furthermore, analysis of 473 PvK12 sequences from
twelve worldwide P. vivax populations confirmed the very limited polymorphism in 
this gene and detected only five distinct haplotypes.
CONCLUSIONS: The PvK12 sequences from global P. vivax populations displayed very 
limited genetic diversity indicating low levels of baseline polymorphisms of
PvK12 in these areas.
