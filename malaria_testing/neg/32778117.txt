BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been broadly studied in malaria for
nearly a decade. These vesicles carry various functional biomolecules including
RNA families such as microRNAs (miRNA). These EVs-derived microRNAs have numerous
roles in host-parasite interactions and are considered promising biomarkers for
disease severity. However, this field lacks clinical studies of malaria-infected 
samples. In this study, EV specific miRNAs were isolated from the plasma of
patients from Thailand infected with Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. 
In addition, it is postulated that these miRNAs were differentially expressed in 
these groups of patients and had a role in disease onset through the regulation
of specific target genes.
METHODS: EVs were purified from the plasma of Thai P. vivax-infected patients
(n = 19), P. falciparum-infected patients (n = 18) and uninfected individuals
(n = 20). EV-derived miRNAs were then prepared and abundance of hsa-miR-15b-5p,
hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p and hsa-miR-150-5p was assessed in these samples.
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed, and relative expression of 
each miRNA was calculated using hsa-miR-451a as endogenous control. Then, the
targets of up-regulated miRNAs and relevant pathways were predicted by using
bioinformatics. Receiver Operating Characteristic with Area under the Curve (AUC)
was then calculated to assess their diagnostic potential.
RESULTS: The relative expression of hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p was higher 
in P. vivax-infected patients compared to uninfected individuals, but
hsa-let-7a-5p was up-regulated in both P. vivax-infected patients and P.
falciparum-infected patients. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNAs
might regulate genes involved in the malaria pathway including the adherens
junction and the transforming growth factor-β pathways. All up-regulated miRNAs
could potentially be used as disease biomarkers as determined by AUC; however,
the sensitivity and specificity require further investigation.
CONCLUSION: An upregulation of hsa-miR-150-5p and hsa-miR-15b-5p was observed in 
P. vivax-infected patients while hsa-let-7a-5p was up-regulated in both P.
vivax-infected and P. falciparum-infected patients. These findings will require
further validation in larger cohort groups of malaria patients to fully
understand the contribution of these EVs miRNAs to malaria detection and biology.
