BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality 
in most low- and middle-income countries. Chloroquine is a previously cheap and
effective antimalarial agent whose loss to resistance resulted in more than
doubling of malaria-related mortality in malaria-endemic countries. Recently,
chloroquine sensitivity is re-emerging among Plasmodium falciparum parasites
which gives hope for malaria control and treatment efforts globally. The aim of
the current review is to establish the prevalence of chloroquine resistance
alleles among P. falciparum parasites in malaria-endemic areas after change in
malaria treatment policy.
METHODS/DESIGN: The articles will be obtained from search of MEDLINE via PubMed, 
SCOPUS, and EMBASE data bases. The Mesh terms will be used in article search.
Boolean operators ("AND," "OR") will be used in article search. The article
search will be done independently by two librarians. The PRISMA-P statement will 
be used to guide the conduct and reporting of the systematic review. STREGA
guideline will be used in developing data abstraction form for the review. Data
abstraction will be done by two independent reviewers, Kappa statistic will be
calculated, and any discrepancies resolved by discussion. Data analysis will be
done using STATA ver 13.0. The level of heterogeneity in the articles will be
established by using the I2-statistic. Publication bias will be assessed using
funnel plot. Random effects analysis will be used.
DISCUSSION: The review seeks to establish the extent of chloroquine resistance
reversal in malaria-endemic countries. The evidence generated from this review
will help guide policy makers on the potential re-emerging role of chloroquine in
malaria treatment.
SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: The systematic review protocol has been
registered in PROSPERO with registration number CRD42018083957.
