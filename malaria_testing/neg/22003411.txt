BACKGROUND: A protective malaria vaccine will likely need to elicit both
cell-mediated and antibody responses. As adenovirus vaccine vectors induce both
these responses in humans, a Phase 1/2a clinical trial was conducted to evaluate 
the efficacy of an adenovirus serotype 5-vectored malaria vaccine against
sporozoite challenge.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC is an adenovirus vector encoding
the Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 circumsporozoite protein (CSP). It is one component
of a two-component vaccine NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA consisting of one adenovector
encoding CSP and one encoding apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) that was evaluated
for safety and immunogenicity in an earlier study (see companion paper, Sedegah
et al). Fourteen Ad5 seropositive or negative adults received two doses of
NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC sixteen weeks apart, at 1 x 1010 particle units per dose. The
vaccine was safe and well tolerated. All volunteers developed positive ELISpot
responses by 28 days after the first immunization (geometric mean 272 spot
forming cells/million[sfc/m]) that declined during the following 16 weeks and
increased after the second dose to levels that in most cases were less than the
initial peak (geometric mean 119 sfc/m). CD8+ predominated over CD4+ responses,
as in the first clinical trial. Antibody responses were poor and like ELISpot
responses increased after the second immunization but did not exceed the initial 
peak. Pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to Ad5 did not affect the
immunogenicity of the first dose, but the fold increase in NAb induced by the
first dose was significantly associated with poorer antibody responses after the 
second dose, while ELISpot responses remained unaffected. When challenged by the 
bite of P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes, two of 11 volunteers showed a delay in
the time to patency compared to infectivity controls, but no volunteers were
sterilely protected.
SIGNIFICANCE: The NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC vaccine expressing CSP was safe and well
tolerated given as two doses, but did not provide sterile protection.
