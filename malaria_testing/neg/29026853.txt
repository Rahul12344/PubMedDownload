BACKGROUND: Caddisflies have significant roles in freshwater ecosystems.
Morphological identification is the major impediment in accurate species
identification of Hydropsychids. Mitochondrial and nuclear markers are suitable
for molecular systematics of these group of arthropods.
METHODS: Trichopteran specimens of Lavasan District in northeastern Tehran, Iran 
were collected in 2012, and described using the morphological and molecular
characters of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mt-COI) and three
expansion fragments of large subunit (LSU) nuclear ribosomal DNA (28S rDNA) D1,
D2, and D3. The resemblance of the specimen sequences was obtained by conducting 
BLAST searches against the GenBank database and by using simple maximum
likelihood clustering using COI, D1, D2, D3, and combination of D1-D2-D3 sequence
data sets.
RESULTS: Based on morphological traits the specimens were resembled to
Hydropsyche sciligra however there were no its counterpart sequences in the
GenBank. Due to lack of unique group of data set for each gene fragment, the
specimens were associated with different taxa on molecular phylograms. The
sequence contents of the COI, D1, D2, D3, and D1-D3 regions clustered H. sciligra
with H. brevis, H. angustipennis, H. occidentalis, H. hedini, H. grahami, and H. 
longifurca/H. naumanni, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Phylogenies obtained from combination of D1-D3 showed the highest
bootstrap values for most of clades suggesting that long LSU-rDNA potentially is 
more useful for understanding phylogenetic relationships of caddisflies. A
large-scale molecular and zoogeographic study on trichopteran species is
suggested to revise and to develop the current knowledge of the caddisfly fauna
and distributions in the country.
