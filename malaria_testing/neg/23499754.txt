The clinical symptoms of malaria are attributed to the blood stage life cycle of 
parasite in which merozoite invades erythrocyte, undergoes multiplication and
exit to re-invade into new erythrocyte to continue its life cycle. The
interaction of repertoire of parasite proteins with host cell receptors is
essential for invasion process. Identification, characterization and localization
of the proteins involved in invasion will enrich our understanding of this
complex process. In the present study we have identified a novel Apical Rhoptry
Neck Protein in Plasmodium falciparum, which harbours a predicted signal and
transmembrane domain and is conserved across the species. The transcription and
translation analysis confirmed its expression in schizont stage of asexual cycle 
of P. falciparum. Immunoflouresence microscopy in schizonts and merozoites
revealed its localization in the neck of rhoptries of P. falciparum. Furthermore,
PfARNP has been found at the tight junction during invasion of P. falciparum
merozoite to erythrocyte.
