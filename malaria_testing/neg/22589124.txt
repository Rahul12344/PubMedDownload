Over the past few years only, next-generation sequencing technologies became
accessible and many applications were rapidly derived, such as the development of
RNA-seq, a technique that uses deep sequencing to profile whole transcriptomes.
RNA-seq has the power to discover new transcripts and splicing variants,
single-nucleotide variations, fusion genes, and mRNA level-based expression
profiles. Preparing RNA-seq libraries can be delicate and usually obligates
buying expensive kits that require large amounts of stating materials. The method
presented here is flexible and cost-effective. Using this method, we prepared
high-quality strand-specific RNA-seq libraries from RNA extracted from the human 
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The libraries are compatible with
Illumina(Â®)'s sequencers Genome Analyzer and Hi-Seq. The method can, however, be 
easily adapted to other platforms.
