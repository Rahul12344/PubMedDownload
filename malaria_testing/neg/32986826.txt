Guenons (tribe Cercopithecini) are the most widely distributed non-human primate 
in the tropical forest belt of Africa and show considerable phenotypic,
taxonomic, and ecological diversity. However, genomic information for most
species within this group is still lacking. Here, we present a high-quality de
novo genome (total 2.90 Gb, contig N50 equal to 22.7 Mb) of the mona monkey
(Cercopithecus mona), together with genome resequencing data of 13 individuals
sampled across Nigeria. Our results showed differentiation between populations
from East and West of the Niger River ∼84 thousands years ago and potential
ancient introgression in the East population from other mona group species. The
PTPRK, FRAS1, BNC2, and EDN3 genes related to pigmentation displayed signals of
introgression in the East population. Genomic scans suggest that immunity genes
such as AKT3 and IL13 (possibly involved in simian immunodeficiency virus
defense), and G6PD, a gene involved in malaria resistance, are under positive
natural selection. Our study gives insights into differentiation, natural
selection and introgression in guenons.
