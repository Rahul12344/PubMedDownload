OBJECTIVES: Tanzania has the third highest birth rate of sickle cell anaemia
(SCA) in Africa, but few studies describe severity of complications or available 
treatments, especially in Northwest Tanzania around Lake Victoria where the
sickle gene is most prevalent. This is a report of the spectrum of clinical
disease and range of interventions available at Bugando Medical Centre (Bugando) 
in Northwest Tanzania in Africa.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Bugando between 1 August 2012
and 30 September 2012. Children (<15 years old) with SCA attending Bugando were
sequentially enrolled. A trained research assistant completed a Swahili
questionnaire with the parent or guardian of each participant concerning
demographic information, clinical features of disease, and treatments received.
RESULTS: Among the 124 participants enrolled, the median age was 6 years
(interquartile range [IQR] 4-8.5), and only 13 (10.5%) were < 3 years old. Almost
all participants (97.6%) had a prior history of a vaso-occlusive episode, 83
(66.9%) had prior acute chest syndrome, and 21 (16.9%) had prior stroke. In the
preceding 12 months, 120 (96.8%) had been hospitalized, and a vaso-occlusive
episode was the most common reason for hospitalization (35.5%). Prescriptions for
folic acid (92.7%) and malaria prophylaxis (84.7%) were common, but only one had 
received a pneumococcal vaccine, and none had received hydroxyurea or
prophylactic penicillin.
CONCLUSION: Children with SCA receiving care in Tanzania are diagnosed late,
hospitalized frequently, and have severe complications. Opportunities exist to
improve care through wider access to screening and diagnosis as well as better
coordination of comprehensive care.
