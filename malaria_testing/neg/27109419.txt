BACKGROUND: From 2007 to 2013, intensive control measures reduced malaria burden 
by 90 % along the China-Myanmar border. However, despite these measures a P.
falciparum malaria outbreak was reported in the Shan Special Region II of Myanmar
in June of 2014.
METHODS: Epidemiological, parasitological and entomological investigations were
performed. Dihydroartemisinin piperaquine (DAPQ) was immediately administered to 
treat parasite positive individuals. Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN),
indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides and behavior change
communication (BCC) were also provided for outbreak control. An embedded efficacy
study was conducted evaluating DP. Molecular genotyping via polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed on the Kelch gene on chromosome 13.
RESULTS: All infections were identified as Plasmodium falciparum by RDT and
microscopy. Two fatalities resulted from the outbreak. The attack rate was 72.8 %
(67/92) and the incidence density rate was 14.2 per 100 person-weeks. The
positive rate of rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 72.2 % (65/90) and
microscopically-determine parasite rate 42.2 % (38/90). Adjusted odds ratio (OR) 
of multivariate logistic regression analysis for aged <15 years, 15-45 years,
inappropriate treatment from a private healer and lack of bed nets were 13.51 (95
% confidence interval, 2.21-105.89), 7.75 (1.48-44.97), 3.78 (1.30-46.18) and
3.21(1.21-15.19) respectively. In the six surrounding communities of the outbreak
site, positive RDT rate was 1.2 % (4/328) and microscopically-determine parasite 
rate 0.6 % (2/328). Two light traps collected a total of 110 anopheline
mosquitoes including local vectors, An. minimus, An. sinensis and An. maculates. 
After intensive control, the detection of malaria attacks, parasites and antigen 
were reduced to zero between July 1 and December 1, 2014. The cure rate of P.
falciparum patients at day 42 was 94.3 % (95 % CI, 80.8-99.3 %). The PCR did not 
detect K13-propeller mutations.
CONCLUSION: Imported P. falciparum caused the outbreak. Age, seeking
inappropriate treatment and lack of bed nets were risk factors for infection
during the outbreak. P. falciparum was sensitive to treatment with DAPQ. The
integrated measures controlled the outbreak and prevented the spread of P.
falciparum effectively. The results of this study indicate that malaria control
on the China-Myanmar border, especially among special populations, needs further 
collaboration between China, Myanmar and international societies.
