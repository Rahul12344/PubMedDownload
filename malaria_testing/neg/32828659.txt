Recent breakthroughs in high-throughput technologies, transcriptomics, and
advances in our understanding of gene regulatory networks have enhanced our
perspective on the complex interplay between parasite and host. Noncoding RNA
molecules have been implicated in critical roles covering a broad range of
biological processes in the Apicomplexa. Processes that are affected range from
parasite development to host-parasite interactions and include interactions with 
epigenetic machinery and other regulatory factors. Here we review recent progress
involving noncoding RNAs and their functions in the Apicomplexa, with a focus on 
three parasites: Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium. We discuss the
limitations and challenges of current methods applied to apicomplexan noncoding
RNA study and discuss future directions in this exciting field.
