Background: Transfusion-transmitted malaria is undoubtedly a potential health
hazard for blood recipients. Egypt is still on the prevention of reintroduction
phase of malaria control program. Fayoum Governorate is considered one of the
high-risk foci in Egypt due to its geology. However, no studies have been
reported to evaluate the current status of subclinical Plasmodium infection based
on sensitive molecular techniques. Moreover, screening of malaria is not listed
within screening protocols of blood-borne pathogens in Fayoum blood banks.
Objective: To assess the current prevalence of subclinical Plasmodium infection
among blood donors of Fayoum inhabitants for transfusion biosafety. To predict
any possibility of the reemergence of malaria in the governorate and the
effectiveness of malaria control measures.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 400 apparently healthy
blood-donors in blood transfusion center of Fayoum University hospital from Jun
2012 to Jan 2013. Conventional PCR was used to detect the 18 S ssrRNA Plasmodium 
gene.
Results: All Fayoum inhabitants' blood donors' samples were negative for
Plasmodium infection.
Conclusions: Current applied control, and preventive measures are valid in the
context of blood transfusion biosafety in Fayoum blood banks and, therefore, the 
implementation of a routine malaria screening test in Fayoum blood banks is not
merited at this time.
