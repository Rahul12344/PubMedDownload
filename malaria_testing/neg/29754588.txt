BACKGROUND: Brazil has seen a great decline in malaria and the country is moving 
towards elimination. However, for eventual elimination, the control program needs
efficient tools in order to monitor malaria exposure and transmission. In this
study, we aimed to evaluate whether seroprevalence to the circumsporozoite
protein (CSP) is a good tool for monitoring the exposure to and/or evaluating the
burden and distribution of Plasmodium species in the Brazilian Amazon.
METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in a rural area of Porto Velho,
Rondônia state. Parasite infection was detected by microscopy and polymerase
chain reaction. Antibodies to the sporozoite CSP repeats of Plasmodium vivax, P. 
falciparum, and P. malariae (PvCS, PfCS, and PmCS) were detected using the
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1
and DQB1 genes were typed using Luminex® xMAP® technology.
RESULTS: The prevalence of immunoglobulin G against P. vivax CSP peptide (62%)
was higher than P. falciparum (49%) and P. malariae (46%) CSP peptide. Most of
the studied individuals had antibodies to at least one of the three peptides
(72%), 34% had antibodies to all three peptides and 28% were non-responders.
Although the majority of the population was not infected at the time of the
survey, 74.3% of parasite-negative individuals had antibodies to at least one of 
the CSPs. Importantly, among individuals carrying the haplotypes DRB1*04~DQB1*03,
there was a significantly higher frequency of PfCS responders, and
DRB1*16~DQB1*03 haplotype for PvCS and PfCS responders. In contrast, HLA-DRB1*01 
and HLA-DQB1*05 allelic groups were associated with a lack of antibodies to P.
vivax and P. falciparum CSP repeats, and the haplotype DRB1*01~DQB1*05 was also
associated with non-responders, including non-responders to P. malariae.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that in low transmission settings, naturally
acquired antibody responses against the CSP repeats of P. vivax, P. falciparum,
and P. malariae in a single cross-sectional study may not represent a valuable
marker for monitoring recent malaria exposure, especially in an area with a high 
prevalence of P. vivax. Furthermore, HLA class II molecules play an important
role in antibody response and require further study with a larger sample size. It
will be of interest to consider HLA analysis when using serosurveillance to
monitor malaria exposure among genetically diverse populations.
