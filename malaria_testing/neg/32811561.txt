BACKGROUND: Understanding the mechanisms used by Anopheles mosquitoes to survive 
insecticide exposure is key to manage existing insecticide resistance and develop
more suitable insecticide-based malaria vector control interventions as well as
other alternative integrated tools. To this regard, the molecular basis of
permethrin, DDT and dieldrin resistance in Anopheles funestus (sensu stricto) at 
Akaka-Remo was investigated.
METHODS: Bioassays were conducted on 3-5-day-old adult An. funestus (s.s.)
mosquitoes for permethrin, DDT and dieldrin susceptibility test. The molecular
mechanisms of mosquito resistance to these insecticides were investigated using
microarray and reverse transcriptase PCR techniques. The voltage-gated sodium
channel region of mosquitoes was also screened for the presence of knockdown
resistance mutations (kdr west and east) by sequencing method.
RESULTS: Anopheles funestus (s.s.) population was resistant to permethrin
(mortality rate of 68%), DDT (mortality rate of 10%) and dieldrin (mortality rate
of 8%) insecticides. Microarray and RT-PCR analyses revealed the overexpression
of glutathione S-transferase genes, cytochrome P450s, esterase, trypsin and
cuticle proteins in resistant mosquitoes compared to control. The GSTe2 was the
most upregulated detoxification gene in permethrin-resistant (FC = 44.89),
DDT-resistant (FC = 57.39) and dieldrin-resistant (FC = 41.10) mosquitoes
compared to control population (FC = 22.34). The cytochrome P450 gene, CYP6P9b
was also upregulated in both permethrin- and DDT-resistant mosquitoes. The
digestive enzyme, trypsin (hydrolytic processes) and the cuticle proteins
(inducing cuticle thickening leading to reduced insecticides penetration) also
showed high involvement in insecticide resistance, through their overexpression
in resistant mosquitoes compared to control. The kdr east and west were absent in
all mosquitoes analysed, suggesting their non-involvement in the observed
mosquito resistance.
CONCLUSIONS: The upregulation of metabolic genes, especially the GSTe2 and
trypsin, as well as the cuticle proteins is driving insecticide resistance of An.
funestus (s.s.) population. However, additional molecular analyses, including
functional metabolic assays of these genes as well as screening for a possible
higher cuticular hydrocarbon and lipid contents, and increased procuticle
thickness in resistant mosquitoes are needed to further describe their distinct
roles in mosquito resistance.
