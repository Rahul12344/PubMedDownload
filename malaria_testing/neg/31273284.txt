Behavioural attraction of the malaria vector Anopheles coluzzii to human host
odour increases during adult maturation. We have previously demonstrated that the
onset of host seeking in An. coluzzii coincides with an increased sensitivity of 
the CO2-sensitive neurons and abundance of chemosensory receptor gene transcripts
in the maxillary palp. In this study, we extend our analysis to the antenna.
Functional characterisation of the near-complete repertoire of odorant receptors 
(Ors) expressed in this tissue, to fractioned human odour, reveals a subset of
salient human odorants to be detected by Ors at physiological relevant
concentrations. When presented as a blend in their ratio of natural emission,
these odorants elicit attraction by host-seeking mosquitoes, emphasising that Ors
alone can mediate this behaviour. However, the same blend inhibits attraction in 
teneral mosquitoes. This switch in behavioural response indicates a change in
valence during adult maturation. Quantitative analysis of Or transcript abundance
and in vivo electrophysiological analysis reveal that the olfactory system of
female An. coluzzii undergoes concerted changes that correlate with the onset of 
host seeking. We conclude that changes in Or abundance modulate peripheral
olfactory coding, resulting in ecologically relevant behavioural effects.
