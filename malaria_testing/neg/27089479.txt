Hispaniola is the only Caribbean island to which Plasmodium falciparum malaria
remains endemic. Resistance to the antimalarial drug chloroquine has rarely been 
reported in Haiti, which is located on Hispaniola, but the K76T pfcrt (P.
falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter) gene mutation that confers
chloroquine resistance has been detected intermittently. We analyzed 901 patient 
samples collected during 2006-2009 and found 2 samples showed possible mixed
parasite infections of genetically chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive
parasites. Direct sequencing of the pfcrt resistance locus and single-nucleotide 
polymorphism barcoding did not definitively identify a resistant population,
suggesting that sustained propagation of chloroquine-resistant parasites was not 
occurring in Haiti during the study period. Comparison of parasites from Haiti
with those from Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela reveals a geographically distinct
population with highly related parasites. Our findings indicate low genetic
diversity in the parasite population and low levels of chloroquine resistance in 
Haiti, raising the possibility that reported cases may be of exogenous origin.
