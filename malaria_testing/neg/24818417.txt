of Plasmodium vivax].

Xu C, Xu XL, Huang BC.

The merozoite surface protein-3alpha of Plasmodium vivax (PvMSP-3alpha) is a
surface protein that is expressed during the asexual blood stages. With a high
polymorphism, PvMSP-3alpha gene has been used as a suitable epidemiology and
genotype marker. Moreover, it might be an important malaria vaccine candidate.
This paper summarizes the research progress on the molecular structure, gene
polymorphism and genotypes of PvMSP-3alpha.
