Gene fusion is a common mechanism of protein evolution that has mainly been
discussed in the context of multidomain or symmetric proteins. Less is known
about fusion of ancestral genes to produce small single-domain proteins. Here, we
show with a domain-swapped mutant Plasmodium profilin that this small, globular, 
apparently single-domain protein consists of two foldons. The separation of
binding sites for different protein ligands in the two halves suggests evolution 
via an ancient gene fusion event, analogous to the formation of multidomain
proteins. Finally, the two fragments can be assembled together after expression
as two separate gene products. The possibility to engineer both domain-swapped
dimers and half-profilins that can be assembled back to a full profilin provides 
perspectives for engineering of novel protein folds, e.g., with different
scaffolding functions.
