New antimalarial drugs are urgently needed to control drug-resistant forms of the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Mitochondrial electron transport is the
target of both existing and new antimalarials. Herein, we describe 11 genetic
knockout (KO) lines that delete six of the eight mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle enzymes. Although all TCA KOs grew normally in asexual blood stages, 
these metabolic deficiencies halted life-cycle progression in later stages.
Specifically, aconitase KO parasites arrested as late gametocytes, whereas
α-ketoglutarate-dehydrogenase-deficient parasites failed to develop oocysts in
the mosquitoes. Mass spectrometry analysis of (13)C-isotope-labeled TCA mutant
parasites showed that P. falciparum has significant flexibility in TCA
metabolism. This flexibility manifested itself through changes in pathway fluxes 
and through altered exchange of substrates between cytosolic and mitochondrial
pools. Our findings suggest that mitochondrial metabolic plasticity is essential 
for parasite development.
