Guyana and Suriname have made important progress in reducing the burden of
malaria. While both countries use microscopy as the primary tool for clinical
diagnosis, malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are useful in remote areas of
the interior where laboratory support may be limited or unavailable. Recent
reports indicate that histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2)-based diagnostic tests
specific for detection of P. falciparum may provide false negative results in
some parts of South America due to the emergence of P. falciparum parasites that 
lack the pfhrp2 gene, and thus produce no PfHRP2 antigen. Pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes
were amplified in parasite isolates collected from Guyana and Suriname to
determine if there were circulating isolates with deletions in these genes.
Pfhrp3 deletions were monitored because some monoclonal antibodies utilized in
PfHRP2-based RDTs cross-react with the PfHRP3 protein. We found that all 97
isolates from Guyana that met the inclusion criteria were both pfhrp2- and
pfhrp3-positive. In Suriname (N = 78), 14% of the samples tested were
pfhrp2-negative while 4% were pfhrp3-negative. Furthermore, analysis of the
genomic region proximal to pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 revealed that genomic deletions
extended to the flanking genes. We also investigated the population substructure 
of the isolates collected to determine if the parasites that had deletions of
pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 belonged to any genetic subtypes. Cluster analysis revealed
that there was no predominant P. falciparum population substructure among the
isolates from either country, an indication of genetic admixture among the
parasite populations. Furthermore, the pfhrp2-deleted parasites from Suriname did
not appear to share a single, unique genetic background.
