Archaeogenetics is the study of exploration of ancient DNA (aDNA) of more than
70 years old. It is an important part of the wider studies of many different
areas of our past, including animal, plant and pathogen evolution and
domestication events. Hereby, we address specifically the impact of research in
archaeogenetics in the broader field of evolutionary medicine. Studies on ancient
hominid genomes help to understand even modern health patterns. Human genetic
microevolution, e.g. related to abilities of post-weaning milk consumption, and
specifically genetic adaptation in disease susceptibility, e.g. towards malaria
and other infectious diseases, are of the upmost importance in contributions of
archeogenetics on the evolutionary understanding of human health and disease.
With the increase in both the understanding of modern medical genetics and the
ability to deep sequence ancient genetic information, the field of archaeogenetic
evolutionary medicine is blossoming.
