Colombia is a megadiverse country with about 600 species of reptiles; however,
there are few studies on species of hemoparasites found in this taxonomic group. 
Here, we document the presence of Plasmodium spp. in four species of reptiles
from the northern part of the Orinoco-Amazon region in Colombia. Individuals
analyzed in this study were captured in localities between 200 and 500 m
altitude, in the department of Guaviare. Each sample was screened for
haemosporidian parasites by using morphology and a nested polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) protocol that targets the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. 
Four morphotypes of the genus Plasmodium were found; two of these species are
re-described using morphological and molecular data (cytb). For the other two
morphotypes, it was not possible to assign a described species. Among those,
Plasmodium screened one species was only detected by microscopy. Considering the 
potential species diversity, it is possible that commonly used primers may not
detect all species, reinforcing the importance of using microscopy in haematozoa 
surveys. There was no correspondence between the morphological traits associated 
with the subgenera and the phylogenetic relationships that we found in our
analyses. Additionally, we found an expansion in the geographical distribution of
these two species, and a new host for P. kentropyxi, demonstrating that studies
of tropical herpetofauna and their parasites deserve more attention.
