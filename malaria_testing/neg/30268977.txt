BACKGROUND: Antigens (or their epitopes)-carrier protein combinations are
extensively utilized for vaccine development strategies. Chemical conjugation
methods are cumbersome with limited conjugation sites. Computational protein
modelling methods can evaluate every position of a carrier protein for
conjugation via epitope grafting in a reasonable time frame as compared to wet
experimental techniques. Graftibility of positions can be estimated by the
presence of native atomic contacts in resulting chimeric antigen.
METHODOLOGY: Five epitopes were selected, and computational grafting at each
position was performed in three templates of serum albumin. Protein modelling
algorithms such as segment matching and satisfaction of spatial restraints were
employed for computational grafting. Contact-based protein discriminatory
function was used to evaluate the chimeric proteins having native atomic
contacts.
RESULTS: On the evaluation of approximately 1 million distinct protein modelling 
simulations, region around the 450th position of serum albumin was observed to be
suitable for epitope grafting.
CONCLUSION: Computational protein modelling tools may be used to design a
chimeric antigen. The approach may overcome the limitations associated with
chemical conjugation and furthermore harness the potential of custom gene
synthesis/recombinant protein production.
