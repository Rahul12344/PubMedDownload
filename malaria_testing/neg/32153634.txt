Background: Cerebral malaria (CM) is characterized by the sequestration of
Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes (pRBCs) to host brain microvasculature beds via 
P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1). Under normal conditions,
activated protein C (APC) bound to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) has
cytoprotective properties via the activation of protease-activated receptor 1
(PAR1). During malaria infection, pRBCs transports PfEMP1 to the membranes to
bind EPCR in the same region as APC. As a result, APC is less capable of inducing
cytoprotective effects via PAR1. Two studies involving adult malaria patients
revealed that EPCR rs867186-GG allele is associated with protection against
severe malaria, while three other studies involving child malaria patients could 
not show association between EPCR rs867186-GG genotype and severe malaria or
increased mortality among children with CM.
Methods: We examined the association between the EPCR rs867186-GG genotype and
the protection against cerebral malaria. Peripheral blood samples were collected 
from 47 malaria patients and 34 healthy individuals from a study conducted from
2004 to 2007 at the NSCB Medical College Hospital in India. CM and
malaria-associated complications were defined based on WHO criteria. Genomic DNA 
was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Primer sequences were
designed to contain rs867186 of the PROCR gene (NM 006404) and were used to
amplify a 660 bp product as described before. PCR products were purified, and DNA
sequences were determined by Sanger Sequencing (Genewiz, NJ). Nonparametric tests
were used to compare the groups. To analyze differences in allele frequencies, we
used chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables if the
expected values were less than 5. P-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results: Our results showed significantly higher rates of AG and GG genotypes in 
CM patients compared to mild malaria (P = 0.0034).
Conclusion: Our results indicate that rs867186-GG or rs867186-AG genotypes are
not associated with protection against HCM.
