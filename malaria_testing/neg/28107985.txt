The highly sensitive and specific detection of Pfg377 gene of Plasmodium
falciparum gametocyte using Magnetic Nanoparticles PCR Enzyme-Linked Gene Assay
(MELGA) was successfully developed. The MELGA included amplification of the
Pfg377 gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs)-conjugated forward primer and biotinylated reverse primer, followed by
post-analytical process using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
streptavidin (SA). The complexes of MELGA product were incubated with the
peroxidase substrate and hydrogen peroxide to produce the signal for colorimetric
measurement. Altogether, the MELGA technique provided a highly sensitive and
specific detection at 1 P. falciparum gametocyte/µL, which was more efficient
than that of microscopic examination and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs).
Additionally, the MELGA could detect target gene at femtogram level, which was
greater sensitive than the conventional PCR, nested PCR and loop-mediated
isothermal amplification (LAMP). The MELGA technique could become a novel and
practical method that overcome limitation of traditional gametocyte detection.
