The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi is now recognized as a species
that can cause human malaria. The first report of large scale human knowlesi
malaria was in 2004 in Malaysia Borneo. Since then, hundreds of human knowlesi
malaria cases have been reported in Southeast Asia. The present study
investigates the genetic polymorphism of P. knowlesi DI domain of the apical
membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1), a protein considered as a promising vaccine candidate
for malaria. The DI domain of AMA-1 gene of P. knowlesi clinical isolates from
Peninsular Malaysia was amplified by PCR, cloned into Escherichia coli, then
sequenced and analysed. Ninety-seven DI domain sequences were obtained.
Comparison at the nucleotide level against P. knowlesi strain H as reference
sequence showed 21 synonymous and 25 nonsynonymous mutations. Nonetheless,
nucleotide sequence analysis revealed low genetic diversity of the DI domain, and
it was under purifying (negative) selection. At the amino acid level, 26
different haplotypes were identified and 2 were predominant haplotypes (H1, H2)
with high frequencies. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 26 haplotypes
could be clustered into 2 distinct groups (I and II). Members of the groups were 
basically derived from haplotypes H1 and H2, respectively.
