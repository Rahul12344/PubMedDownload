BACKGROUND: Malaria is a significant public health concern in Haiti where
approximately 30,000 cases are reported annually with CDC estimates as high as
200,000. Malaria infections in Haiti are caused almost exclusively by Plasmodium 
falciparum, while a small number of Plasmodium malariae and an even smaller
number of putative Plasmodium vivax infections have been reported. The lack of
confirmed P. vivax infections in Haiti could be due to the genetic background of 
native Haitians. Having descended from West African populations, many Haitians
could be Duffy negative due to a single nucleotide polymorphism from thymine to
cytosine in the GATA box of the promoter region of the Duffy antigen receptor for
chemokines (DARC) gene. This mutation, encoded by the FYES allele, eliminates the
expression of the Duffy antigen on erythrocytes, which reduces invasion by P.
vivax. This study investigated the frequency of the FYES allele and P. vivax
infections in malaria patients with the goal of uncovering factors for the lack
of P. vivax infections reported in Haiti.
METHODS: DNA was extracted from dried blood spots collected from malaria patients
at four clinic locations in Haiti. The samples were analysed by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) for the presence of the P. vivax small subunit ribosomal RNA gene.
PCR, sequencing, and restriction enzyme digestion were used to detect the
presence of the FYES allele. Matched samples were examined for both presence of
P. vivax and the FYES allele.
RESULTS: No cases of P. vivax were detected in any of the samples (0/136). Of all
samples tested for the FYES allele, 99.4% had the FYES allele (163/164). Of the
matched samples, 99% had the FYES allele (98/99).
CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, no cases of P. vivax were confirmed by
PCR and 99% of the malaria patients tested carried the FYES allele. The high
frequency of the FYES allele that silences erythroid expression of the Duffy
antigen offers a biologically plausible explanation for the lack of P. vivax
infections observed. These results provide insights on the host susceptibility
for P. vivax infections that has never before been investigated in Haiti.
