Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) play key regulatory roles in the life
cycle of the malaria parasite, but in many cases their precise molecular
functions are unknown. Using the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, we
show that CDPK1, which is known to be essential in the asexual blood stage of the
parasite, is expressed in all life stages and is indispensable during the sexual 
mosquito life-cycle stages. Knockdown of CDPK1 in sexual stages resulted in
developmentally arrested parasites and prevented mosquito transmission, and these
effects were independent of the previously proposed function for CDPK1 in
regulating parasite motility. In-depth translational and transcriptional
profiling of arrested parasites revealed that CDPK1 translationally activates
mRNA species in the developing zygote that in macrogametes remain repressed via
their 3' and 5'UTRs. These findings indicate that CDPK1 is a multifunctional
protein that translationally regulates mRNAs to ensure timely and stage-specific 
protein expression.
