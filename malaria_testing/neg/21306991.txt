Second-generation sequencing technologies have made large-scale sequencing
projects commonplace. However, making use of these datasets often requires gene
function to be ascribed genome wide. Although tool development has kept pace with
the changes in sequence production, for tasks such as mapping, de novo assembly
or visualization, genome annotation remains a challenge. We have developed a
method to rapidly provide accurate annotation for new genomes using previously
annotated genomes as a reference. The method, implemented in a tool called RATT
(Rapid Annotation Transfer Tool), transfers annotations from a high-quality
reference to a new genome on the basis of conserved synteny. We demonstrate that 
a Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome or a single 2.5 Mb chromosome from a malaria 
parasite can be annotated in less than five minutes with only modest
computational resources. RATT is available at http://ratt.sourceforge.net.
