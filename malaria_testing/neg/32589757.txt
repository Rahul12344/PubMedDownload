Glandular secretory trichomes (GSTs) are regarded as biofactories for
synthesizing, storing, and secreting artemisinin. It is necessary to figure out
the initiation and development regulatory mechanism of GSTs to cultivate
high-yielding Artemisia annua. Here, we identified an MYB transcription factor,
AaTAR2, from bioinformatics analysis of the A. annua genome database and
Arabidopsis trichome development-related genes. AaTAR2 is mainly expressed in
young leaves and located in the nucleus. Repression and overexpression of AaTAR2 
resulted in a decrease and increase, respectively, in the GSTs numbers, leaf
biomass, and the artemisinin content in transgenic plants. Furthermore, the
morphological characteristics changed obviously in trichomes, suggesting AaTAR2
plays a key role in trichome formation. In addition, the expression of flavonoid 
biosynthesis genes and total flavonoid content increased dramatically in
AaTAR2-overexpressing transgenic plants. Owing to flavonoids possibly
counteracting emerging resistance to artemisinin in Plasmodium species, AaTAR2 is
a potential target to improve the effect of artemisinin in clinical therapy.
Taken together, AaTAR2 positively regulates trichome development and artemisinin 
and flavonoid biosynthesis. A better understanding of this 'multiple functions'
transcription factor may enable enhanced artemisinin and flavonoids yield. AaTAR2
is a potential breeding target for cultivating high-quality A. annua.
