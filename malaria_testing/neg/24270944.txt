Early identification of causal genetic variants underlying antimalarial drug
resistance could provide robust epidemiological tools for timely public health
interventions. Using a novel natural genetics strategy for mapping novel
candidate genes we analyzed >75,000 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms 
selected from high-resolution whole-genome sequencing data in 27 isolates of
Plasmodium falciparum. We identified genetic variants associated with
susceptibility to dihydroartemisinin that implicate one region on chromosome 13, 
a candidate gene on chromosome 1 (PFA0220w, a UBP1 ortholog) and others
(PFB0560w, PFB0630c, PFF0445w) with putative roles in protein homeostasis and
stress response. There was a strong signal for positive selection on PFA0220w,
but not the other candidate loci. Our results demonstrate the power of
full-genome sequencing-based association studies for uncovering candidate genes
that determine parasite sensitivity to artemisinins. Our study provides a unique 
reference for the interpretation of results from resistant infections.
