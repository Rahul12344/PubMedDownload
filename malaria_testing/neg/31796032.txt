BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive endeavours, developing an effective malaria
vaccine remains as a great challenge. Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) located
on the merozoite surface of parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium is
involved in red blood cell invasion.
METHODS: Influenza virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines containing codon-optimized 
or native (non-codon optimized) AMA-1 from Plasmodium berghei were generated.
VLP-induced protective immunity was evaluated in a mouse model.
RESULTS: Mice immunized with VLP vaccine containing the codon-optimized AMA-1
elicited higher levels of P. berghei-specific IgG and IgG2a antibody responses
compared to VLPs containing non-codon optimized AMA-1 before and after challenge 
infection. Codon-optimized AMA-1 VLP vaccination induced higher levels of CD4+ T 
cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and germinal centre cell responses compared to
non-codon optimized AMA-1 VLPs. Importantly, the codon-optimized AMA-1 VLP
vaccination showed lower body weight loss, longer survival and a significant
decrease in parasitaemia compared to non-codon optimized VLP vaccination.
CONCLUSION: Overall, VLP vaccine expressing codon-optimized AMA-1 induced better 
protective efficacy than VLPs expressing the non-codon optimized AMA-1. Current
findings highlight the importance of codon-optimization for vaccine use and its
potential involvement in future malaria vaccine design strategies.
