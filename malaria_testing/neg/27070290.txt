Flavonoids were found to synergize anti-malaria and anti-cancer compounds in
Artemisia annua, a very important economic crop in China. In order to discover
the regulation mechanism of flavonoids in Artemisia annua, the full length cDNA
of flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) were isolated from Artemisia annua for the first
time by using RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The completed open read
frame of AaF3H was 1095 bp and it encoded a 364-amino acid protein with a
predicted molecular mass of 41.18 kDa and a pI of 5.67. The recombinant protein
of AaF3H was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) as His-tagged protein, purified by
Ni-NTA agrose affinity chromatography, and functionally characterized in vitro.
The results showed that the His-tagged protein (AaF3H) catalyzed naringenin to
dihydrokaempferol in the present of Fe(2+). The Km for naringenin was 218.03 μM. 
The optimum pH for AaF3H reaction was determined to be pH 8.5, and the optimum
temperature was determined to be 35 °C. The AaF3H transcripts were found to be
accumulated in the cultivar with higher level of flavonoids than that with lower 
level of flavonoids, which implied that AaF3H was a potential target for
regulation of flavonoids biosynthesis in Artemisia annua through metabolic
engineering.
