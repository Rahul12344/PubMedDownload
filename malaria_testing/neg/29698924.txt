Almost invariably, humans become ill during primary infections with malaria
parasites which is a pathology associated with oxidative stress and perturbations
in metabolism. Importantly, repetitive exposure to Plasmodium results in
asymptomatic infections, which is a condition defined as clinical tolerance.
Integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data provides a powerful way to
investigate complex disease processes involving oxidative stress, energy
metabolism and immune cell activation. We used metabolomics and transcriptomics
to investigate the different clinical outcomes in a P. vivax controlled human
malaria infection trial. At baseline, the naïve and semi-immune subjects differed
in the expression of interferon related genes, neutrophil and B cell signatures
that progressed with distinct kinetics after infection. Metabolomics data
indicated differences in amino acid pathways and lipid metabolism between the two
groups. Top pathways during the course of infection included methionine and
cysteine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and urea cycle. There is also evidence
for the activation of lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase and non-specific lipid
peroxidation products in the semi-immune group. The integration of
transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed concerted molecular events triggered by
the infection, notably involving platelet activation, innate immunity and T cell 
signaling. Additional experiment confirmed that the metabolites associated with
platelet activation genes were indeed enriched in the platelet metabolome.
