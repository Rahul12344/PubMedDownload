BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major global health burden despite the
intensification of control efforts, due partly to the lack of an effective
vaccine. Information on genetic diversity in natural parasite populations
constitutes a major impediment to vaccine development efforts and is limited in
some endemic settings. The present study characterized diversity by investigating
msp1 block 2 polymorphisms and the relationship between the allele families with 
ethnodemographic indices and clinical phenotype.
METHOD: Individuals with asymptomatic parasitaemia (AP) or uncomplicated malaria 
(UM) were enrolled from rural, semi-rural and semi-urban localities at varying
altitudes along the slope of mount Cameroon. P. falciparum malaria parasitaemic
blood screened by light microscopy was depleted of leucocytes using CF11
cellulose columns and the parasite DNA genotyped by nested PCR.
RESULTS: Length polymorphism was assessed in 151 field isolates revealing 64 (5) 
and 274 (22) distinct recombinant and major msp1 allelic fragments (genotypes)
respectively. All family specific allelic types (K1, MAD20 and RO33) as well as
MR were observed in the different locations, with K1 being most abundant. Eighty 
seven (60 %) of individuals harbored more than one parasite clone, with a
significant proportion (p = 0.009) in rural compared to other settings. AP
individuals had higher (p = 0.007) K1 allele frequencies but lower (p = 0.003)
mean multiplicity of genotypes per infection (2.00 ± 0.98 vs. 2.56 ± 1.17)
compared to UM patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate enormous diversity of P. falciparum in the
area and suggests that allele specificity and complexity may be relevant for the 
progression to symptomatic disease.
