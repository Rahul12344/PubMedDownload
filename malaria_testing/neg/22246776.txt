Exocytosis is essential to the lytic cycle of apicomplexan parasites and required
for the pathogenesis of toxoplasmosis and malaria. DOC2 proteins recruit the
membrane fusion machinery required for exocytosis in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. 
Here, the phenotype of a Toxoplasma gondii conditional mutant impaired in host
cell invasion and egress was pinpointed to a defect in secretion of the
micronemes, an apicomplexan-specific organelle that contains adhesion proteins.
Whole-genome sequencing identified the etiological point mutation in TgDOC2.1. A 
conditional allele of the orthologous gene engineered into Plasmodium falciparum 
was also defective in microneme secretion. However, the major effect was on
invasion, suggesting that microneme secretion is dispensable for Plasmodium
egress.
