BACKGROUND: The circumsporozoite protein is the most abundant polypeptide
expressed by sporozoites, the malaria parasite stage capable of infecting humans.
Sporozoite invasion of mosquito salivary glands prior to transmission is likely
mediated by a receptor/ligand-like interaction of the parasites with the target
tissues, and the amino (NH2)-terminal portion of CSP is involved in this
interaction but not the TSR region on the carboxyl (C)-terminus. Peptides based
on the NH2-terminal domain could compete with the parasites for the salivary
gland receptors and thus inhibit penetration.
METHODS: Peptides based on the NH2-terminus and TSR domains of the CSP from avian
or human malaria parasites, Plasmodium gallinaceum and Plasmodium falciparum,
respectively, were expressed endogenously in mosquito haemolymph using a
transient (Sindbis virus-mediated) or stable (piggyBac-mediated transgenesis)
system.
RESULTS: Transient endogenous expression of partial NH2-terminus peptide from P. 
falciparum CSP in P. gallinaceum-infected Aedes aegypti resulted in a reduced
number of sporozoites in the salivary glands. When a transgenic approach was used
to express a partial CSP NH2-terminal domain from P. gallinaceum the number of
sporozoites in the salivary glands did not show a difference when compared to
controls. However, a significant difference could be observed when mosquitoes
with a lower infection were analysed. The same result could not be observed with 
mosquitoes endogenously expressing peptides based on the TSR domain from either
P. gallinaceum or P. falciparum.
CONCLUSION: These results support the conclusion that CSP partial NH2-terminal
domain can be endogenously expressed to promote a competition for the receptor
used by sporozoites to invade salivary glands, and they could be used to block
this interaction and reduce parasite transmission. The same effect cannot be
obtained with peptides based on the TSR domain.
