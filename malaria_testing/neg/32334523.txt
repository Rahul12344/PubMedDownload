BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed malaria parasite, and
its drug resistance poses unique challenges to malaria elimination. The Greater
Mekong Subregion (GMS) is known as the global epicenter of multidrug resistance. 
Surveillance of molecular markers associated with drug resistance in this area
will help to inform drug policy.
METHODS: Dry blood spots from 58 patients out of 109 with P. vivax infection
between 2017, December and 2019, March were obtained from Yingjiang County,
Yunnan Province, along the China-Myanmar border. Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1 and
Pvcrt-o were amplified and sequenced to assess gene mutations. The polymorphism
and prevalence of these molecular markers were analyzed.
RESULTS: Mutations in Pvdhfr at codons 57, 58, 61, 99 and 117 were detected in
27.59, 48.28, 27.59, 32.76 and 48.28% of the isolates, respectively. Single
mutant haplotype (I13F57S58T61S99S117I173) was the most frequent (29.31%, 17/58),
followed by double mutant haplotype (20.69%, 12/58). Of three types of tandem
repeat variations of Pvdhfr, deletion type was the most common. Pvdhps showed a
lower prevalence among mutation genotypes. Single mutant was dominant and
accounted for 34.48% (20/58). Prevalence of Pvmdr1 mutations at codons 958 and
1076 were 100.00% and 84.48%, respectively. The proportion of double and single
mutant types was 84.48% (49/58) and 15.52% (9/58), respectively. Eleven samples
(18.97%, 11/58) showed K10 "AAG" insertion in chloroquine resistance transporter 
gene Pvcrt-o.
CONCLUSIONS: There was moderate diversity of molecular patterns of resistance
markers of Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1 and Pvcrt-o in imported P. vivax cases to
Yingjiang county in Western Yunnan, along the China-Myanmar border. Prevalence
and molecular pattern of candidate drug resistance markers Pvdhfr, Pvdhps, Pvmdr1
and Pvcrt-o were demonstrated in this current study, which would help to update
drug policy.
