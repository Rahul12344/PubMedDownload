Gene drive technology offers the promise for a high-impact, cost-effective, and
durable method to control malaria transmission that would make a significant
contribution to elimination. Gene drive systems, such as those based on clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated
protein, have the potential to spread beneficial traits through interbreeding
populations of malaria mosquitoes. However, the characteristics of this
technology have raised concerns that necessitate careful consideration of the
product development pathway. A multidisciplinary working group considered the
implications of low-threshold gene drive systems on the development pathway
described in the World Health Organization Guidance Framework for testing
genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes, focusing on reduction of malaria
transmission by Anopheles gambiae s.l. mosquitoes in Africa as a case study. The 
group developed recommendations for the safe and ethical testing of gene drive
mosquitoes, drawing on prior experience with other vector control tools, GM
organisms, and biocontrol agents. These recommendations are organized according
to a testing plan that seeks to maximize safety by incrementally increasing the
degree of human and environmental exposure to the investigational product. As
with biocontrol agents, emphasis is placed on safety evaluation at the end of
physically confined laboratory testing as a major decision point for whether to
enter field testing. Progression through the testing pathway is based on
fulfillment of safety and efficacy criteria, and is subject to regulatory and
ethical approvals, as well as social acceptance. The working group identified
several resources that were considered important to support responsible field
testing of gene drive mosquitoes.
