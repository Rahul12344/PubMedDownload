BACKGROUND: Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) species are known to be the
vectors of Bluetongue virus and African Horses Sickness virus (AHSV) in different
areas of the world. Nevertheless, other researchers have hypothesized that these 
arthropods could be involved in the transmission of other pathogens such as
Schmallenberg virus, Plasmodium and Leishmania parasites. Identification of the
Culicoides' potential vector competence is crucial in understanding the worldwide
Culicoides/Leishmania life cycle.
FINDINGS: Blood fed and parous females of biting midges Culicoides spp. were
collected between 2009 and 2010 in Central Tunisia. DNA was extracted from
individual blood fed Culicoides and used as a template in a genus-specific PCR.
Leishmania DNA was detected in 14 Culicoides imicola specimens and one Culicoides
circumscriptus. In a second step, parasite identification was performed based on 
a single copy Topo-isomerase II gene specific amplification and sequencing.
Leishmania infantum was identified in two infected Culicoides spp.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of Leishmania DNA detection from naturally
infected wild caught Culicoides spp. Our finding supports the assumption that
Culicoides spp. are a potential vector for L. infantum.
