BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of different
species of Plasmodium and haplotypes of pfcrt in Plasmodium falciparum from the
selected area.
METHODS: Overall, 10,372 blood films of suspected malarial patients were examined
microscopically from rural health center Sinawan, district Muzaffargarh, Pakistan
from November 2008 to November 2010. P. falciparum positive samples (both whole
blood and FTA blood spotted cards) were used for DNA extraction. Nested PCR was
used to amplify the pfcrt (codon 72-76) gene fragment. Sequencing was carried out
to find the haplotypes in the amplified fragment of pfcrt gene.
RESULT: Over all slide positivity rate (SPR), P. vivax and P. falciparum
positivity rate was 21.40 %, 19.37 % and 2.03% respectively. FTA blood spotted
cards were equally efficient in the blood storage for PCR and sequencing.
Analysis of sequencing results of pfcrt showed only one type of haplotype
SagtVMNT (AGTGTAATGAATACA) from codon 72-76 in all samples.
CONCLUSION: The results show high prevalence of CQ resistance and AQ resistant
genes. AQ is not recommended to be used as a partner drug in ACT in this
locality, so as to ward off future catastrophes.
