BACKGROUND: Over 2700 genes are subject to stage-specific regulation during the
intraerythrocytic development of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum. Bioinformatic analyses have identified a large number of
over-represented motifs in the 5' flanking regions of these genes that may act as
cis-acting factors in the promoter-based control of temporal expression. Triaging
these lists to provide candidates most likely to play a role in regulating
temporal expression is challenging, but important if we are to effectively design
in vitro studies to validate this role.
METHODS: We report here the application of a repeated search of variations of 5' 
flanking sequences from P. falciparum using the Finding Informative Regulatory
Elements (FIRE) algorithm.
RESULTS: Our approach repeatedly found a short-list of high scoring DNA motifs,
for which cognate specific transcription factors were available, that appear to
be typically associated with upregulation of mRNA accumulation during the first
half of intraerythrocytic development.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose these cis-trans interactions may provide a combinatorial 
promoter-based control of gene expression to complement more global mechanisms of
gene regulation that can account for temporal control during the second half of
intraerythrocytic development.
