Insects rely on the innate immune system for defense against pathogens, some
aspects of which are under hormonal control. Here we provide direct experimental 
evidence showing that the juvenile hormone-binding protein (mJHBP) of Aedes
aegypti is required for the regulation of innate immune responses and the
development of mosquito blood cells (hemocytes). Using an mJHBP-deficient
mosquito line generated by means of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology we
uncovered a mutant phenotype characterized by immunosuppression at the humoral
and cellular levels, which profoundly affected susceptibility to bacterial
infection. Bacteria-challenged mosquitoes exhibited significantly higher levels
of septicemia and mortality relative to the wild type (WT) strain, delayed
expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), severe developmental dysregulation
of embryonic and larval hemocytes (reduction in the total number of hemocytes)
and increased differentiation of the granulocyte lineage. Interestingly,
injection of recombinant wild type mJHBP protein into adult females three-days
before infection was sufficient to restore normal immune function. Similarly,
injection of mJHBP into fourth-instar larvae fully restored normal larval/pupal
hemocyte populations in emerging adults. More importantly, the recovery of normal
immuno-activation and hemocyte development requires the capability of mJHBP to
bind JH III. These results strongly suggest that JH III functions in mosquito
immunity and hemocyte development in a manner that is perhaps independent of
canonical JH signaling, given the lack of developmental and reproductive
abnormalities. Because of the prominent role of hemocytes as regulators of
mosquito immunity, this novel discovery may have broader implications for the
understanding of vector endocrinology, hemocyte development, vector competence
and disease transmission.
