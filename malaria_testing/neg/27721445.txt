Malaria remains one of the greatest public health challenges worldwide,
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The clinical outcome of individuals infected 
with Plasmodium falciparum parasites depends on many factors including host
systemic inflammatory responses, parasite sequestration in tissues and vascular
dysfunction. Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promotes
endothelial activation as well as recruitment and infiltration of inflammatory
cells, which in turn triggers further endothelial cell activation and parasite
sequestration. Inflammatory responses are triggered in part by bioactive parasite
products such as hemozoin and infected red blood cell-derived extracellular
vesicles (iRBC-derived EVs). Here we demonstrate that such EVs contain functional
miRNA-Argonaute 2 complexes that are derived from the host RBC. Moreover, we show
that EVs are efficiently internalized by endothelial cells, where the
miRNA-Argonaute 2 complexes modulate target gene expression and barrier
properties. Altogether, these findings provide a mechanistic link between EVs and
vascular dysfunction during malaria infection.
