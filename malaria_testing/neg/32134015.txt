Background & objectives: In India, spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) are an 
underdiagnosed cause of acute febrile illness (AFI). The non-specific Weil-Felix 
test is the first diagnostic modality for the diagnosis of SFGR in many
laboratories due to the lack of advanced diagnostic facilities in developing
countries. The aim of this study was to detect SFGR using molecular methods in
the patients, presenting with AFI in a tertiary care centre in north India.
Methods: Consecutive patients (>14 yr of age) with AFI were enrolled over a six
month period. Standard investigations for common pathogens causing AFI in India
(malaria, dengue, scrub typhus, leptospirosis and enteric fever) were carried
out. In patients who were negative for all of the above investigations, blood was
subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting outer membrane protein A
(ompA) gene of Rickettsia.
Results: Of the 51 patients with an undiagnosed aetiology, three were positive by
ompA PCR. Two of the PCR products produced good sequences and BLAST
identification confirmed them as Rickettsia conorii. The sequences of R. conorii 
reported from south India clustered with two previously reported novel
rickettsial genotypes. The study sequences clustered in a group different from
that of Rickettsia spp. of the south Indian sequences reported earlier.
Interpretation & conclusions: This study showed the existence of R. conorii in
north India. Testing for SFGR may be included in the diagnostic workup of AFI for
better disease management.
