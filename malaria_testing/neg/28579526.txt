Malaria is a life-threatening blood disease caused by the protozoan Plasmodium.
Infection may lead to several different patterns of symptoms in the host:
asymptomatic state, uncomplicated disease or severe disease. Severe malaria
occurs mostly in young children and is a major cause of death. Disease is thought
to result from the sequestration of parasites in the small blood vessels of the
brain and the deregulation of key immune system elements. The cellular and
molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of disease are
however not fully understood. What is known it is that the genetic determinants
of the host play an important role in the severity of the disease and the outcome
of infection. Here we review the most convincing results obtained through genetic
epidemiology studies concerning the genetic control of malaria in human caused by
Plasmodium falciparum infection. The identification of genes conferring
susceptibility or resistance to malaria might improve diagnosis and treatment.
