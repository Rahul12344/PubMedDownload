BACKGROUND: Malaria reduction and future elimination in China is made more
difficult by the importation of cases from neighboring endemic countries,
particularly Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, and increased travel to Africa by
Chinese nationals. The increasing prevalence of artemisinin resistant parasites
across Southeast Asia highlights the importance of monitoring the parasite
importation into China. Artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region is associated
with variants of genes encoding the K13 kelch domain protein (pf13k), found in
specific genetic backgrounds, including certain alleles of genes encoding the
chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt) and multidrug resistance transporter
PgH1 (pfmdr1).
METHODS: In this study we investigated the prevalence of drug resistance markers 
in 72 P. falciparum samples from uncomplicated malaria infections in Tengchong
and Yingjiang, counties on the Yunnan-Myanmar border. Variants of pf13k, pfcrt
and pfmdr1 are described.
RESULTS: Almost all parasites harboured chloroquine-resistant alleles of pfcrt,
whereas pfmdr1 was more diverse. Major mutations in the K13 propeller domain
associated with artemisinin resistance in the Mekong region (C580Y, R539T and
Y493H) were absent, but F446I and two previously undescribed mutations (V603E and
V454I) were identified. Protein structural modelling was carried out in silico on
each of these K13 variants, based on recently published crystal structures for
the K13 propeller domain. Whereas F446I was predicted to elicit a moderate
destabilisation of the propeller structure, the V603E substitution is likely to
lead to relatively high protein instability. We plotted these stability
estimates, and those for all previously described variants, against published
values for in vivo parasitaemia half-life, and found that quadratic regression
generates a useful predictive algorithm.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a baseline of P. falciparum resistance-associated
mutations prevalent at the China-Myanmar border. We also show that protein
modelling can be used to generate testable predictions as to the impact of pfk13 
mutations on in vivo (and potentially in vitro) artemisinin susceptibility.
