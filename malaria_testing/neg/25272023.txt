Numerous studies have indicated a strong association between amplification of the
multidrug resistance-1 gene and in vivo and in vitro mefloquine resistance of
Plasmodium falciparum. Although falciparum infection usually is not treated with 
mefloquine, incorrect diagnosis, high frequency of undetected mixed infections,
or relapses of P. vivax infection triggered by P. falciparum infections expose
non-P. falciparum parasites to mefloquine. To assess the consequences of such
unintentional treatments on P. vivax, we studied variations in number of Pvmdr-1 
(PlasmoDB accession no. PVX_080100, NCBI reference sequence NC_009915.1) copies
worldwide in 607 samples collected in areas with different histories of
mefloquine use from residents and from travelers returning to France. Number of
Pvmdr-1 copies correlated with drug use history. Treatment against P. falciparum 
exerts substantial collateral pressure against sympatric P. vivax, jeopardizing
future use of mefloquine against P. vivax. A drug policy is needed that takes
into consideration all co-endemic species of malaria parasites.
