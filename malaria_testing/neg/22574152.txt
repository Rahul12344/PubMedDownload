Malaria is a life-threatening human infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes.
Levels of the salivary gland sporozoites (sgs), the only mosquito stage
infectious to a mammalian host, represent an important cumulative index of
Plasmodium development within a mosquito. However, current techniques of sgs
quantification are laborious and imprecise. Here, transgenic P. berghei reporter 
lines that produce the green fluorescent protein fused to luciferase (GFP-LUC)
specifically in sgs were generated, verified and characterised. Fluorescence
microscopy confirmed the sgs stage specificity of expression of the reporter
gene. The luciferase activity of the reporter lines was then exploited to
establish a simple and fast biochemical assay to evaluate sgs loads in whole
mosquitoes. Using this assay we successfully identified differences in sgs loads 
in mosquitoes silenced for genes that display opposing effects on P. berghei
ookinete/oocyst development. It offers a new powerful tool to study infectivity
of P. berghei to the mosquito, including analysis of vector-parasite interactions
and evaluation of transmission-blocking vaccines.
