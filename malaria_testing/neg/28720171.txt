Plasmodium knowlesi has risen in importance as a zoonotic parasite that has been 
causing regular episodes of malaria throughout South East Asia. The P. knowlesi
genome sequence generated in 2008 highlighted and confirmed many similarities and
differences in Plasmodium species, including a global view of several multigene
families, such as the large SICAvar multigene family encoding the variant
antigens known as the schizont-infected cell agglutination proteins. However,
repetitive DNA sequences are the bane of any genome project, and this and other
Plasmodium genome projects have not been immune to the gaps, rearrangements and
other pitfalls created by these genomic features. Today, long-read PacBio and
chromatin conformation technologies are overcoming such obstacles. Here, based on
the use of these technologies, we present a highly refined de novo P. knowlesi
genome sequence of the Pk1(A+) clone. This sequence and annotation, referred to
as the 'MaHPIC Pk genome sequence', includes manual annotation of the SICAvar
gene family with 136 full-length members categorized as type I or II. This
sequence provides a framework that will permit a better understanding of the
SICAvar repertoire, selective pressures acting on this gene family and mechanisms
of antigenic variation in this species and other pathogens.
