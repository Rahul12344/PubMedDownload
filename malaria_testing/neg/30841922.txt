BACKGROUND: Bioko is one of the few islands that exist around Africa, the most
genetically diverse continent on the planet. The native Bantu-speaking
inhabitants of Bioko, the Bubi, are believed to have colonized the island about
2000 years ago. Here, we sequenced the genome of thirteen Bubi individuals at
high coverage and analysed their sequences in comparison to mainland populations 
from the Gulf of Guinea.
RESULTS: We found that, genetically, the closest mainland population to the Bubi 
are Bantu-speaking groups from Angola instead the geographically closer groups
from Cameroon. The Bubi possess a lower proportion of rainforest hunter-gatherer 
(RHG) ancestry than most other Bantu-speaking groups. However, their RHG
component most likely came from the same source and could have reached them by
gene flow from the mainland after island settlement. By studying identity by
descent (IBD) genomic blocks and runs of homozygosity (ROHs), we found evidence
for a significant level of genetic isolation among the Bubi, isolation that can
be attributed to the island effect. Additionally, as this population is known to 
have one of the highest malaria incidence rates in the world we analysed their
genome for malaria-resistant alleles. However, we were unable to detect any
specific selective sweeps related to this disease.
CONCLUSIONS: By describing their dispersal to the Atlantic islands, the genomic
characterization of the Bubi contributes to the understanding of the margins of
the massive Bantu migration that shaped all Sub-Saharan African populations.
