BACKGROUND: Establishing antibody correlates of protection against malaria in
human field studies and clinical trials requires, amongst others, an accurate
estimation of antibody levels. For polymorphic antigens such as apical membrane
antigen 1 (AMA1), this may be confounded by the occurrence of a large number of
allelic variants in nature.
METHODS: To test this hypothesis, plasma antibody levels in an age-stratified
cohort of naturally exposed children from a malaria-endemic area in Southern
Ghana were determined by indirect ELISA. Titres against four single PfAMA1
alleles were compared with those against three different allele mixtures presumed
to have a wider repertoire of epitope specificities. Associations of antibody
levels with the incidence of clinical malaria as well as with previous exposure
to parasites were also examined.
RESULTS: Antibody titres against PfAMA1 alleles generally increased with
age/exposure while antibody specificity for PfAMA1 variants decreased, implying
that younger children (â‰¤ 5 years) elicit a more strain-specific antibody response
compared to older children. Antibody titre measurements against the FVO and 3D7
AMA1 alleles gave the best titre estimates as these varied least in pair-wise
comparisons with titres against all PfAMA1 allele mixtures. There was no
association between antibody levels against any capture antigen and either
clinical malaria incidence or parasite density.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data shows that levels of naturally acquired
antigen-specific antibodies, especially in infants and young children, are
dependent on the antigenic allele used for measurement. This may be relevant to
the interpretation of antibody titre data from measurements against single PfAMA1
alleles, especially in studies involving infants and young children who have
experienced fewer infections.
