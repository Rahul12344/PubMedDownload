BACKGROUND: Malaria control efforts have a significant impact on the epidemiology
and parasite population dynamics. In countries aiming for malaria elimination,
malaria transmission may be restricted to limited transmission hot spots, where
parasite populations may be isolated from each other and experience different
selection forces. Here we aim to examine the Plasmodium vivax population
divergence in geographically isolated transmission zones in Thailand.
METHODOLOGY: We employed the P. vivax merozoite surface protein 3β (PvMSP3β) as a
molecular marker for characterizing P. vivax populations based on the extensive
diversity of this gene in Southeast Asian parasite populations. To examine two
parasite populations with different transmission levels in Thailand, we obtained 
45 P. vivax isolates from Tak Province, northwestern Thailand, where the annual
parasite incidence (API) was more than 2%, and 28 isolates from Yala and
Narathiwat Provinces, southern Thailand, where the API was less than 0.02%. We
sequenced the PvMSP3β gene and examined its genetic diversity and molecular
evolution between the parasite populations.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 58 isolates containing single PvMSP3β alleles, 31 sequence
types were identified. The overall haplotype diversity was 0.77 ± 0.06 and
nucleotide diversity 0.0877±0.0054. The northwestern vivax malaria population
exhibited extensive haplotype diversity (HD) of PvMSP3β (HD=1.0). In contrast,
the southern parasite population displayed a single PvMSP3β allele (HD=0),
suggesting a clonal population expansion. This result revealed that the extent of
allelic diversity in P. vivax populations in Thailand varies among endemic areas.
CONCLUSION: Malaria parasite populations in a given region may vary significantly
in genetic diversity, which may be the result of control and influenced by the
magnitude of malaria transmission intensity. This is an issue that should be
taken into account for the implementation of P. vivax control measures such as
drug policy and vaccine development.
