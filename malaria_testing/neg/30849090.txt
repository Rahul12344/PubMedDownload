Populations in sub-Saharan Africa have historically been exposed to intense
selection from chronic infection with falciparum malaria. Interestingly,
populations with the highest malaria intensity can be identified by the increased
occurrence of endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (eBL), a pediatric cancer that affects
populations with intense malaria exposure, in the so called "eBL belt" in
sub-Saharan Africa. However, the effects of intense malaria exposure and
sub-Saharan populations' genetic histories remain poorly explored. To determine
if historical migrations and intense malaria exposure have shaped the genetic
composition of the eBL belt populations, we genotyped ~4.3 million SNPs in 1,708 
individuals from Ghana and Northern Uganda, located on opposite sides of eBL belt
and with ≥ 7 months/year of intense malaria exposure and published evidence of
high incidence of BL. Among 35 Ghanaian tribes, we showed a predominantly
West-Central African ancestry and genomic footprints of gene flow from Gambian
and East African populations. In Uganda, the North West population showed a
predominantly Nilotic ancestry, and the North Central population was a mixture of
Nilotic and Southern Bantu ancestry, while the Southwest Ugandan population
showed a predominant Southern Bantu ancestry. Our results support the hypothesis 
of diverse ancestral origins of the Ugandan, Kenyan and Tanzanian Great Lakes
African populations, reflecting a confluence of Nilotic, Cushitic and Bantu
migrations in the last 3000 years. Natural selection analyses suggest, for the
first time, a strong positive selection signal in the ATP2B4 gene (rs10900588) in
Northern Ugandan populations. These findings provide important baseline genomic
data to facilitate disease association studies, including of eBL, in eBL belt
populations.
