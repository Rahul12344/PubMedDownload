BACKGROUND: Currently, artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the
first-line anti-malarial treatment in malaria-endemic areas. However, resistance 
in Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin-based combinations emerging in the
Greater Mekong Sub-region is a major problem hindering malaria elimination. To
continuously monitor the potential spread of ACT-resistant parasites, this study 
assessed the efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for falciparum malaria in
western Myanmar.
METHODS: Ninety-five patients with malaria symptoms from Paletwa Township, Chin
State, Myanmar were screened for P. falciparum infections in 2015. After
excluding six patients with a parasite density below 100 or over 150,000/µL, 41
P. falciparum patients were treated with AL and followed for 28 days. Molecular
markers associated with resistance to 4-amino-quinoline drugs (pfcrt and pfmdr1),
antifolate drugs (pfdhps and pfdhfr) and artemisinin (pfk13) were genotyped to
determine the prevalence of mutations associated with anti-malarial drug
resistance.
RESULTS: For the 41 P. falciparum patients (27 children and 14 adults), the
28-day AL therapeutic efficacy was 100%, but five cases (12.2%) were parasite
positive on day 3 by microscopy. For the pfk13 gene, the frequency of NN insert
after the position 136 was 100% in the day-3 parasite-positive group as compared 
to 50.0% in the day-3 parasite-negative group, albeit the difference was not
statistically significant (P = 0.113). The pfk13 K189T mutation (10.0%) was found
in Myanmar for the first time. The pfcrt K76T and A220S mutations were all fixed 
in the parasite population. In pfmdr1, the Y184F mutation was present in 23.3% of
the parasite population, and found in both day-3 parasite-positive and -negative 
parasites. The G968A mutation of pfmdr1 gene was first reported in Myanmar.
Prevalence of all the mutations in pfdhfr and pfdhps genes assessed was over 70%,
with the exception of the pfdhps A581G mutation, which was 3.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: AL remained highly efficacious in western Myanmar. Pfk13 mutations
associated with artemisinin resistance were not found. The high prevalence of
mutations in pfcrt, pfdhfr and pfdhps suggests high-degree resistance to
chloroquine and antifolate drugs. The pfmdr1 N86/184F/D1246 haplotype associated 
with selection by AL in Africa reached > 20% in this study. The detection
of > 10% patients who were day-3 parasite-positive after AL treatment emphasizes 
the necessity of continuously monitoring ACT efficacy in western Myanmar.
