We compared the prevalence of key pfmdr1 alleles between pretreatment Plasmodium 
falciparum parasite isolates and parasites that emerged after treatment of
uncomplicated malaria in a longitudinal cohort of Ugandan children. The pfmdr1
86N, 184F, and 1246D alleles were selected after treatment with
artemether-lumefantrine, but not after artesunate-amodiaquine or
amodiaquine-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Remarkably, selection persisted in
infections presenting up to about 60 days after treatment with
artemether-lumefantrine. Thus, parasites selected for decreased drug sensitivity 
can appear long after predicted exposure to antimalarial drugs. Continued
surveillance of the clinical efficacy and in vitro activity of new combination
therapies is warranted.
