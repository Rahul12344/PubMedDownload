Artemisinin, an important compound produced by Artemisia annua, is the active
ingredient in the treatment of malaria. Jasmonic acid, one of the phytohormones, 
is an important elicitor of artemisinin biosynthesis by enhancing transcription
levels of transcription factors. SPL transcription factors are plant-specific
transcription factors of plant growth, development, and secondary metabolism
regulation. However, to date, the SPL transcription factors that regulate
artemisinin biosynthesis is currently unclear. Here, we show that an SPL
transcription factor can positively regulate artemisinin biosynthesis by binding 
to the promoter of artemisinin biosynthetic pathway genes. We screened AaSPL2 by 
gene expression profiles analysis in 14 SPL transcription factors. We
demonstrated that AaSPL2 can activate the promoter of DBR2 by dual-LUC assy.
Moreover, in the AaSPL2 overexpression plants, the artemisinin content was
increased by 33-86%, and in the AaSPL2 -RNAi transgenic plants, artemisinin
content was decreased by 33-65%. These data suggest that AaSPL2 and DBR2 interact
with a "GTAC" cis-element in the DBR2 promoter, mediating the transcriptional
activation of DBR2 in response to JA and resulting in the improvement on
artemisinin content.
