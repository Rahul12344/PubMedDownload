Genotyping of allelic variants of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface
proteins 1 and 2 (msp-1 and msp-2), and the glutamate-rich protein is the gold
standard for distinguishing reinfections from recrudescences in antimalarial drug
trials. We compared performance of the recently developed 24-single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) Barcoding Assay against msp-1 and msp-2 genotyping in a
cluster-randomized effectiveness trial of artemether-lumefantrine and
dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in Malawi. Rates of recrudescence and reinfection 
estimated by the two methods did not differ significantly (Fisher's exact test; P
= 0.887 and P = 0.768, respectively). There was a strong agreement between the
two methods in predicting treatment outcomes and resolving the genetic complexity
of malaria infections in this setting. These results support the use of this SNP 
assay as an alternative method for correcting antimalarial efficacy/effectiveness
data.
