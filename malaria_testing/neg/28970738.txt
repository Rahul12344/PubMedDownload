CD14 is a multifunctional receptor expressed on many cell types and has been
shown to mediate immune response resulting in the activation of an inflammatory
cascade, with polymorphism of its promoter (rs2569190) found to be associated
with susceptibility to several diseases. In malaria infection, the CD14 gene
demonstrated a pathogenic profile in regulating experimental cerebral malaria,
with reports of elevated levels of soluble CD14 in serum of patients but no
definitive conclusion. We present a detailed analysis of genetic diversity of
CD14 promoter gene (snp -159 C/T; rs2519190) polymorphism between a
malaria-infected group and uninfected controls and its association with clinical 
parameters of disease. Genomic DNA samples obtained from 106 Plasmodium
falciparum malaria-infected patients and 277 uninfected controls were elucidated 
with a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) 
assay. Our results show a significant diversity (P = 3.32E-06) in the genotypic
frequency (3.8% versus 22.4%) of the rs2569190 mutant variant between the
malaria-infected group and controls, respectively. The mutant allele had the
lowest frequency among the malaria-infected group demonstrating its necessity for
infection. Mean parasitemia (parasites/μL of blood) was significantly regulated
based on CD14 polymorphic profile (19 855 versus 37 041 versus 49 396 for
homozygote mutants, heterozygotes, and homozygote wild type, respectively).
Interestingly, we found no association between CD14 genetic variants with fever, 
age of patients, or anemia. How this affects disease severity between subregional
and continental groups deserves further clarification, including extending these 
studies in a larger group and among severe and asymptomatic patients with
malaria.
