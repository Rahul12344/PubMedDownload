BACKGROUND: Malaria-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (MA-ARDS) is a
potentially lethal complication of clinical malaria. Acute lung injury in MA-ARDS
shares features with ARDS triggered by other causes, including alveolar
inflammation and increased alveolar-capillary permeability, leading to leak of
protein-rich pulmonary oedema fluid. Mechanisms and physiologic alterations in
MA-ARDS can be examined in murine models of this syndrome. Integrin αDβ2 is a
member of the leukocyte, or β2 (CD18), sub-family of integrins, and emerging
observations indicate that it has important activities in leukocyte adhesion,
accumulation and signalling. The goal was to perform analysis of the lungs of
mice wild type C57Bl/6 (a D (+/+) ) and Knockout C57Bl/6 (a D (-/-) ) with
malaria-associated acute lung injury to better determine the relevancy of the
murine models and investigate the mechanism of disease.
METHODS: C57BL/6 wild type (a D (+/+) ) and deficient for CD11d sub-unit (a D
(-/-) ) mice were monitored after infection with 10(5) Plasmodium berghei ANKA.
CD11d subunit expression RNA was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction,
vascular barrier integrity by Evans blue dye (EBD) exclusion and cytokines by
ELISA. Protein and leukocytes were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF) samples. Tissue cellularity was measured by the point-counting technique, 
F4/80 and VCAM-1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Respiratory function was
analysed by non-invasive BUXCO and mechanical ventilation.
RESULTS: Alveolar inflammation, vascular and interstitial accumulation of
monocytes and macrophages, and disrupted alveolar-capillary barrier function with
exudation of protein-rich pulmonary oedema fluid were present in P.
berghei-infected wild type mice and were improved in αDβ2-deficient animals. Key 
pro-inflammatory cytokines were also decreased in lung tissue from α D (-/-)
mice, providing a mechanistic explanation for reduced alveolar-capillary
inflammation and leak.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that αDβ2 is an important inflammatory effector
molecule in P. berghei-induced MA-ARDS, and that leukocyte integrins regulate
critical inflammatory and pathophysiologic events in this model of complicated
malaria. Genetic deletion of integrin subunit αD in mice, leading to deficiency
of integrin αDβ2, alters lung inflammation and acute lung injury in a mouse model
of MA-ARDS caused by P. berghei.
