BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma,
which is a common childhood cancer in areas with intense transmission of
Plasmodium falciparum parasites. Early and accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite
for successful therapy, but it optimally involves advanced laboratory
investigations. These are technologically demanding, expensive, and often
difficult to implement in settings where eBL is prevalent. Diagnosis is thus
generally based on clinical assessment and morphological examination of tumour
biopsies or fine-needle aspirates (FNAs).
METHODS: The purpose of the present study was to assess the accuracy of eBL
diagnosis at two tertiary hospitals in Ghana. To that end, we studied FNAs from
29 eBL patients and 21 non-eBL lymphoma patients originally diagnosed in 2018. In
addition, we examined 111 archival formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
biopsies from Ghanaian patients originally diagnosed as eBL (N = 55) or non-eBL
(N = 56) between 2010 and 2017. Availability-based subsets of samples were
subjected to haematoxylin-eosin or Giemsa staining, C-MYC immunohistochemistry,
and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of c-myc rearrangements.
RESULTS: We found a good correlation between original diagnosis and subsequent
retrospective assessment, particularly for FNA samples. However, evidence of
intact c-myc genes and normal C-MYC expression in samples from some patients
originally diagnosed as eBL indicates that morphological assessment alone can
lead to eBL over-diagnosis in our study area. In addition, several FFPE samples
could not be assessed retrospectively, due to poor sample quality. Therefore, the
simpler FNA method of obtaining tumour material is preferable, particularly when 
careful processing of biopsy specimens cannot be guaranteed.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that the accuracy of eBL diagnostic tools available in
Ghana is generally adequate, but could be improved by implementation of
additional pathology laboratory investigations. Improved attention to adequate
preservation of archival samples is recommended.
