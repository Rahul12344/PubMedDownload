Thirty-seven blood samples from Plasmodium vivax-infected patients were collected
in Henan Province in 2011. The gene for circumsporozoite protein (PvCSP) was
amplified by nested PCR. According to the epidemiological data, among the 37
Plasmodium vivax malaria cases, 26 were indigenous cases and 11 were imported
cases. A fragment of 750 bp was obtained in the 37 blood samples. The 750 bp PCR 
product was digested with restriction endonuclease Alu-I and Mva-I, and genetic
polymorphism was investigated with PCR-RFLP. PCR-RFLP analysis of PvCSP revealed 
that the parasites were PV-I type (97.3%, 36/37) and PV-II type (2.7%, 1/37). 26 
samples from indigenous cases were exclusively PV-I type with PV-I-b type (57.7%,
15/26) and PV-I-a type (42.3%, 11/26). Among 11 samples from imported cases,
PV-I-a type accounted for 90.9% (10/11), and 1 PV-II type accounted for 9.1%
(1/11), no PV-I-b type were detected.
