BACKGROUND: Malaria in Yemen is mainly caused by Plasmodium falciparum and 25% of
the population is at high risk. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) had been used as
monotherapy against P. falciparum. Emergence of chloroquine resistance led to the
shift in anti-malarial treatment policy in Yemen to artemisinin-based combination
therapy, that is artesunate (AS) plus SP as first-line therapy for uncomplicated 
malaria and artemether-lumefantrine as second-line treatment. This study aimed to
screen mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate
synthetase (dhps) genes associated with SP resistance among P. falciparum
population in Hadhramout governorate, Yemen.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots of 137 P. falciparum
isolates collected from a community-based study. DNA was amplified using nested
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps 
genes. Sequences were analysed for mutations in Pfdhfr gene codons 51, 59, 108,
and 164 and in Pfdhps gene codons 436, 437, and 540.
RESULTS: A total of 128 and 114 P. falciparum isolates were successfully
sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes, respectively. Each Pfdhfr mutant allele
(I51 and N108) in P. falciparum population had a frequency of 84%. Pfdhfr R59
mutant allele was detected in one isolate. Mutation at codon 437 (G437) in the
Pfdhps gene was detected in 44.7% of falciparum malaria isolates. Frequencies of 
Pfdhfr double mutant genotype (I51C59N108I164) and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps triple mutant
genotype (I51C59N108I164-S436G437K540) were 82.8 and 39.3%, respectively. One
isolate harboured Pfdhfr triple mutant genotype (I51, R59, N108, I164) and
Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple mutant genotype (I51R59N108I164-S436G437K540).
CONCLUSION: High frequencies of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutant alleles and genotypes in
P. falciparum population in Hadhramout, Yemen, highlight the risk of developing
resistance for SP, the partner drug of AS, which subsequently will expose the
parasite to AS monotherapy increasing then the potential of the emergence of AS
resistance. Study findings necessitate the continuous monitoring of the efficacy 
of the national anti-malarial drugs policy in Yemen. In addition, monitoring SP
efficacy using molecular markers that has shown to be a practical and informative
method for monitoring the partner drug of AS.
