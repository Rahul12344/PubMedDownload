BACKGROUND: Although spargana, which are the plerocercoids of Spirometra
erinacei, are of biological and clinical importance, expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) from this parasite have not been explored. To understand molecular and
biological features of this parasite, sparganum ESTs were examined by large-scale
EST sequencing and multiple bioinformatics tools.
METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from spargana and then ESTs were generated,
assembled and sequenced. Many biological aspects of spargana were investigated
using multi-step bioinformatics tools.
RESULTS: A total of 5,634 ESTs were collected from spargana. After clustering and
assembly, the functions of 1,794 Sparganum Assembled ESTs (SpAEs) including 934
contigs and 860 singletons were analyzed. A total of 1,351 (75%) SpAEs were
annotated using a hybrid of BLASTX and InterProScan. Of these genes, 1,041 (58%) 
SpAEs had high similarity to tapeworms. In the context of the biology of
sparganum, our analyses reveal: (i) a highly expressed fibronectin 1, a
ubiquitous and abundant glycoprotein; (ii) up-regulation of enzymes related with 
glycolysis pathway; (iii) most frequent domains of protein kinase and RNA
recognition motif domain; (iv) a set of helminth-parasitic and spargana-specific 
genes that may offer a number of antigen candidates.
CONCLUSIONS: Our transcriptomic analysis of S. erinacei spargana demonstrates
biological aspects of a parasite that invades and travels through subcutaneous
tissue in intermediate hosts. Future studies should include comparative analyses 
using combinations of transcriptome and proteome data collected from the entire
life cycle of S. erinacei.
