Doxycycline is widely used for malaria prophylaxis by international travelers.
However, there is limited information on doxycycline efficacy in Kenya, and
genetic polymorphisms associated with reduced efficacy are not well defined. In
vitro doxycycline susceptibility profiles for 96 Plasmodium falciparum field
isolates from Kenya were determined. Genetic polymorphisms were assessed in P.
falciparum metabolite drug transporter (Pfmdt) and P. falciparum GTPase tetQ
(PftetQ) genes. Copy number variation of the gene and the number of KYNNNN amino 
acid motif repeats within the protein encoded by PftetQ were determined. Reduced 
in vitro susceptibility to doxycycline was defined by 50% inhibitory
concentrations (IC50s) of ≥35,000 nM. The odds ratio (OR) of having 2 PfTetQ
KYNNNN amino acid repeats in isolates with IC50s of >35,000 nM relative to those 
with IC50s of <35,000 nM is 15 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 74.3; P
value of <0.0002). Isolates with 1 copy of the Pfmdt gene had a median IC50 of
6,971 nM, whereas those with a Pfmdt copy number of >1 had a median IC50 of 9,912
nM (P = 0.0245). Isolates with 1 copy of PftetQ had a median IC50 of 6,370 nM,
whereas isolates with a PftetQ copy number of >1 had a median IC50 of 3,422 nM (P
< 0.0007). Isolates with 2 PfTetQ KYNNNN motif repeats had a median IC50 of
26,165 nM, whereas isolates with 3 PfTetQ KYNNNN repeats had a median IC50 of
3,352 nM (P = 0.0023). PfTetQ sequence polymorphism is associated with a reduced 
doxycycline susceptibility phenotype in Kenyan isolates and is a potential marker
for susceptibility testing.
