The immune system contributes to the maintenance of health by preventing and
limiting the clinical consequences of infections by pathogenic microorganisms.
During the evolution of Homo sapiens, those with the fittest immune system
survived. The immune system of Homo sapiens was further improved and adapted by
admixture with Neanderthal genes. Nowadays, the human immune system provides
adequate protection against the majority of infections. For some 20 infectious
diseases, the immune system needs to be improved by vaccination. Vaccination is
the number one value-based healthcare intervention and has resulted inÂ global
eradication of smallpox. Eradication of poliomyelitis and measles is within
reach. A continuous effort will be required for recently emerged pathogens, such 
as Ebola and HIV, as well as the most difficult - malaria and tuberculosis.
