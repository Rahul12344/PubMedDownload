Plasmodium vivax is the leading cause of malaria outside Africa and represents a 
significant health and economic burden on affected countries. A major obstacle
for P. vivax eradication is the dormant hypnozoite liver stage that causes
relapse infections and the limited antimalarial drugs that clear this stage.
Advances in studying the hypnozoite and other unique biological aspects of this
parasite are hampered by the lack of a continuous in vitro laboratory culture
system and poor availability of molecular tools for genetic manipulation. In this
study, we aim to develop molecular tools that can be used for genetic
manipulation of P. vivax. A putative P. vivax centromere sequence (PvCEN) was
cloned and episomal centromere based plasmids expressing a GFP marker were
constructed. Centromere activity was evaluated using a rodent malaria parasite
Plasmodium yoelii. A plasmid carrying PvCEN was stably maintained in
asexual-stage parasites in the absence of drug pressure, and approximately 45% of
the parasites retained the plasmid four weeks later. The same retention rate was 
observed in parasites possessing a native P. yoelii centromere (PyCEN)-based
control plasmid. The segregation efficiency of the plasmid per nuclear division
was > 99% in PvCEN parasites, compared to ~90% in a control parasite harboring a 
plasmid without a centromere. In addition, we observed a clear GFP signal in both
oocysts and salivary gland sporozoites isolated from mosquitoes. In blood-stage
parasites after liver stage development, GFP positivity in PvCEN parasites was
comparable to control PyCEN parasites. Thus, PvCEN plasmids were maintained
throughout the parasite life cycle. We also validated several P. vivax promoter
activities and showed that hsp70 promoter (~1 kb) was active throughout the
parasite life cycle. This is the first data for the functional characterization
of a P. vivax centromere that can be used in future P. vivax biological research.
