Efficacious antimalarial drugs are important for malaria control and elimination,
and continuous monitoring of their efficacy is essential. The prevalence and
distribution of Pfmdr1 were evaluated in African migrant workers in Henan
Province. Among 632 isolates, 13 haplotypes were identified, NYSND (39.87%,
252/632), YYSND (2.85%, 18/632), NFSND (31.01%, 196/632), NYSNY (0.47%, 3/632),
YFSND (13.77%, 87/632), NFSNY (0.32%, 2/632), YYSNY (2.06%, 13/632), YFSNY
(0.16%, 1/632), N/Y YSND (1.90%, 12/632), N Y/F SND (6.17%, 39/632), N/Y Y/F SND 
(0.47%, 3/632), YYSN D/Y (0.16%, 1/632) and N/Y FSND (0.79%, 5/632). The highest 
frequency of NYSND was observed in individuals from North Africa (63.64%, 7/11), 
followed by South Africa (61.33%, 111/181), Central Africa (33.33%, 56/168), West
Africa (28.94%, 68/235) and East Africa (27.03%, 10/37) (χ2 = 54.605, P &lt;
0.05). The highest frequency of NFSND was observed in East Africa (48.65%,
18/37), followed by West Africa (39.14%, 92/235), Central Africa (26.79%,
45/168), South Africa (22.65%, 41/181) and North Africa (9.09%, 1/11) (χ2 =
22.368 P &lt; 0.05). The mutant prevalence of codons 86 and 184 decreased. These 
data may provide complementary information on antimalarial resistance that may be
utilized in the development of a treatment regimen for Henan Province.
