BACKGROUND: In multicellular organisms, alternative splicing is central to tissue
differentiation and identity. Unicellular protists lack multicellular tissue but 
differentiate into variable cell types during their life cycles. The role of
alternative splicing in transitions between cell types and establishing cellular 
identity is currently unknown in any unicellular organism.
RESULTS: To test whether alternative splicing in unicellular protists plays a
role in cellular differentiation, we conduct RNA-seq to compare splicing in
female and male sexual stages to asexual intraerythrocytic stages in the rodent
malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei. We find extensive changes in alternative
splicing between stages and a role for alternative splicing in sexual
differentiation. Previously, general gametocyte differentiation was shown to be
modulated by specific transcription factors. Here, we show that alternative
splicing establishes a subsequent layer of regulation, controlling genes relating
to consequent sex-specific differentiation of gametocytes.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that alternative splicing is reprogrammed during
cellular differentiation of a unicellular protist. Disruption of an alternative
splicing factor, PbSR-MG, perturbs sex-specific alternative splicing and
decreases the ability of the parasites to differentiate into male gametes and
oocysts, thereby reducing transmission between vertebrate and insect hosts. Our
results reveal alternative splicing as an integral, stage-specific phenomenon in 
these protists and as a regulator of cellular differentiation that arose early in
eukaryotic evolution.
