While gene flow between distantly related populations is increasingly recognized 
as a potentially important source of adaptive genetic variation for humans, fully
characterized examples are rare. In addition, the role that natural selection for
resistance to vivax malaria may have played in the extreme distribution of the
protective Duffy-null allele, which is nearly completely fixed in mainland
sub-Saharan Africa and absent elsewhere, is controversial. We address both these 
issues by investigating the evolution of the Duffy-null allele in the Malagasy, a
recently admixed population with major ancestry components from both East Asia
and mainland sub-Saharan Africa. We used genome-wide genetic data and extensive
computer simulations to show that the high frequency of the Duffy-null allele in 
Madagascar can only be explained in the absence of positive natural selection
under extreme demographic scenarios involving high genetic drift. However, the
observed genomic single nucleotide polymorphism diversity in the Malagasy is
incompatible with such extreme demographic scenarios, indicating that positive
selection for the Duffy-null allele best explains the high frequency of the
allele in Madagascar. We estimate the selection coefficient to be 0.066. Because 
vivax malaria is endemic to Madagascar, this result supports the hypothesis that 
malaria resistance drove fixation of the Duffy-null allele in mainland
sub-Saharan Africa.
