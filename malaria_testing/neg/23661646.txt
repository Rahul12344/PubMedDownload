Plasmodium falciparum transmission by Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes is remarkably 
efficient, resulting in a very high prevalence of human malaria infection in
sub-Saharan Africa. A combination of genetic mapping, linkage group selection,
and functional genomics was used to identify Pfs47 as a P. falciparum gene that
allows the parasite to infect A. gambiae without activating the mosquito immune
system. Disruption of Pfs47 greatly reduced parasite survival in the mosquito,
and this phenotype could be reverted by genetic complementation of the parasite
or by disruption of the mosquito complement-like system. Pfs47 suppresses midgut 
nitration responses that are critical to activate the complement-like system. We 
provide direct experimental evidence that immune evasion mediated by Pfs47 is
critical for efficient human malaria transmission by A. gambiae.
