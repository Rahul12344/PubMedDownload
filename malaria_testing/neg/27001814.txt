The emergence and spread of artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is of
huge concern for the global effort toward malaria control and elimination.
Artemisinin resistance, defined as a delayed time to parasite clearance following
administration of artemisinin, is associated with mutations in the Pfkelch13 gene
of resistant parasites. To date, as many as 60 nonsynonymous mutations have been 
identified in this gene, but whether these mutations have been selected by
artemisinin usage or merely reflect natural polymorphism independent of selection
is currently unknown. To clarify this, we sequenced the Pfkelch13 propeller
domain in 581 isolates collected before (420 isolates) and after (161 isolates)
the implementation of artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), from various
regions of endemicity worldwide. Nonsynonymous mutations were observed in 1% of
parasites isolated prior to the introduction of ACTs. Frequencies of mutant
isolates, nucleotide diversity, and haplotype diversity were significantly higher
in the parasites isolated from populations exposed to artemisinin than in those
from populations that had not been exposed to the drug. In the
artemisinin-exposed population, a significant excess of dN compared to dS was
observed, suggesting the presence of positive selection. In contrast, pairwise
comparison of dN and dS and the McDonald and Kreitman test indicate that
purifying selection acts on the Pfkelch13 propeller domain in populations not
exposed to ACTs. These population genetic analyses reveal a low baseline of
Pfkelch13 polymorphism, probably due to purifying selection in the absence of
artemisinin selection. In contrast, various Pfkelch13 mutations have been
selected under artemisinin pressure.
