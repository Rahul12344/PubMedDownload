INTRODUCTION: We performed a transversal study to map resistance of malaria
vectors (Anopheles mosquitoes) to insecticides in Niger within the frame of the
National Malaria Control Program funded by the World Health Organization (WHO).
METHOD: Larvae of Anopheles gambiae s.l were collected from November to December 
2013 in seven locations selected on the basis of different patterns of use of
insecticides and environment. WHO susceptibility test tubes were used on females 
Anopheles to detect resistance to insecticides. Eight insecticides were tested.
Percentages of knockdown during exposure time to pyrethroids and DDT and
mortality after 24hours of observation for all tested insecticides were
calculated. PCR and biochemical tests were carried out to identify the species
and mechanisms of resistance (Kdr allele frequencies and activity of
detoxification enzymes).
RESULTS: In all sites, Anopheles gambiae s.l was susceptible to bendiocarb and
malathion but resistant to the five pyrethroids and DDT (24-hour mortality rate
was <90%). The Kdr mutation was present in the molecular form M of Anopheles
gambiae with an average frequency of 58%. Biochemical tests showed the activity
of various enzyme families (esterase, oxidase, and glutathione s-transferase).
CONCLUSION: This study showed multiple resistance of Anopheles mosquitoes to
insecticides in Niger. A rigorous management of this resistance is imperative to 
preserve the efficacy of pyrethroids as it is the only class of insecticides used
for insecticide-treated nets.
