Empirical evidence suggests that the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum
employs a broad range of mechanisms to regulate gene transcription throughout the
organism's complex life cycle. To better understand this regulatory machinery, we
assembled a rich collection of genomic and epigenomic data sets, including
information about transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, patterns of covalent 
histone modifications, nucleosome occupancy, GC content, and global 3D genome
architecture. We used these data to train machine learning models to discriminate
between high-expression and low-expression genes, focusing on three distinct
stages of the red blood cell phase of the Plasmodium life cycle. Our results
highlight the importance of histone modifications and 3D chromatin architecture
in Plasmodium transcriptional regulation and suggest that AP2 transcription
factors may play a limited regulatory role, perhaps operating in conjunction with
epigenetic factors.
