BACKGROUND: Primaquine, an 8-aminoquinoline with anti-hypnozoite activity against
Plasmodium vivax, is metabolized by human cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) to its
active metabolite. Human CYP2D6 activities may influence the metabolism of
primaquine and the risk of experiencing Plasmodium relapses following primaquine 
anti-relapse therapies (PART). In this study, the CYP2D6 profile and its
relationship with outcomes of PART in Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel is
retrospectively investigated.
METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from stored and de-identified serum or blood
samples from ADF personnel deployed on peacekeeping duties to Papua New Guinea
(PNG) (1999) and East Timor (1999-2000) who received PART before returning to
Australia and after experiencing relapses. CYP2D6 allelic type was determined by 
PCR and Sanger sequencing. CYP2D6 allele frequency, predicted phenotypes and
activity scores were compared among personnel who did not experience P. vivax
(ADF-NR, n = 48) and those who experience at least one (ADF-R, n = 109) relapse, 
as well as between those who experienced 1 (n = 79), 2 (n = 21) and 3-5 (n = 9)
relapses within the ADF-R group.
RESULTS: 16 CYP2D6 alleles were observed in 157 ADF personnel. Alleles *1, *4, *2
and *41 were major alleles (> 5%). The CYP2D6 allele frequency profile in the
ADF-NR group matched that of a European population. There was an increased
proportion of non-functional CYP2D6 alleles in the ADF-R group compared to the
European population and ADF-NR group. However, frequencies of predicted CYP2D6
phenotype and activity score were not different between the ADF-R and ADF-NR
groups, nor among sub-groups experiencing multiple relapses within the ADF-R
group.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2D6 phenotype or activity score based on the allele
classification was not a major contributor to P. vivax relapse in this ADF
cohort. Other factors such as adherence and/or parasite tolerance to primaquine
are likely contributing factors to P. vivax relapses in this cohort.
