BACKGROUND: Plasmodium vivax contains approximately 5400 coding genes, more than 
40% of which code for hypothetical proteins that have not been functionally
characterized. In a previous preliminary screening using pooled serum samples,
numerous hypothetical proteins were selected from among those that were highly
transcribed in the schizont-stage of parasites, and highly antigenic P. vivax
candidates including hypothetical proteins were identified. However, their
immunological and functional activities in P. vivax remain unclear. From these
candidates, we investigated a P. vivax 50-kDa protein (Pv50, PVX_087140)
containing a highly conserved signal peptide that shows high transcription levels
in blood-stage parasites.
RESULTS: Recombinant Pv50 was expressed in a cell-free expression system and used
for IgG prevalence analysis of patients with vivax malaria and healthy
individuals. Immune responses were analyzed in immunized mice and mouse
antibodies were used to detect the subcellular localization of the protein in
blood-stage parasites by immunofluorescence assay. A protein array method was
used to evaluate protein-protein interactions to predict protein functional
activities during the invasion of parasites into erythrocytes. Recombinant Pv50
showed IgG prevalence in patient samples with a sensitivity of 42.9% and
specificity of 93.8% compared to that in healthy individuals. The non-cytophilic 
antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 were the major components involved in the antibody
response in Pv50-immunized mice. Pv50 localized on the surface of merozoites and 
a specific interaction between Pv50 and PvMSP1 was detected, suggesting that
Pv50-PvMSP1 forms a heterodimeric complex in P. vivax.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased immune responses caused by native P. vivax parasites were 
detected, confirming its immunogenic effects. This study provides a method for
detecting new malaria antigens, and Pv50 may be a vivax malaria vaccine candidate
with PvMSP1.
