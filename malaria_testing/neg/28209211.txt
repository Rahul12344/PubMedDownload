BACKGROUND: Anopheles anthropophagus is one of the major vectors of malaria in
Asia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in cell development and
differentiation as well as in the cellular response to stress and infection. In a
former study, we have investigated the global miRNA profiles in relation to sex
in An. anthropophagus. However, the miRNAs contributing to the blood-feeding and 
infection with Plasmodium are still unknown.
METHODS: High-throughput sequencing was performed to identify miRNA profiles of
An. anthropophagus midguts after blood-feeding and Plasmodium infection. The
expression patterns of miRNA in different midgut libraries were compared based on
transcripts per million reads (TPM), and further confirmed by Northern blots.
Target prediction and pathway analysis were carried out to investigate the role
of regulated miRNAs in blood-feeding and Plasmodium infection.
RESULTS: We identified 67 known and 21 novel miRNAs in all three libraries
(sugar-feeding, blood-feeding and Plasmodium infection) in An. anthropophagus
midguts. Comparing with the sugar-feeding, the experssion of nine (6 known and 3 
novel) and ten (9 known and 1 novel) miRNAs were significantly upregulated and
downregulated respectively after blood-feeding (P < 0.05, fold change ≥ 2 and
TPM ≥ 10). Plasmodium infection induced the expression of thirteen (9 known and 4
novel) and eleven (9 known and 2 novel) miRNAs significantly upregulated and
downregulated, respectively, compared with blood-feeding. The representative
upregulated miR-92a in blood-feeding and downregulated miR-275 in Plasmodium
infection were further confirmed by Northern Blot. Putative targets of these
regulated miRNAs were further investigated and classified into their pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that miRNAs are involved in the blood-feeding
and Plasmodium infection in An. anthropophagus midgut. Further studies of the
function of these differential expressed miRNAs will facilitate in better
understanding of mosquito biology and anti-parasite immunity.
