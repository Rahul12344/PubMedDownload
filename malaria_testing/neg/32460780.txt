BACKGROUND: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have become the most common diagnostic 
tool for detection of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, in particular in remote
areas. RDT blood spots provide a source of parasite DNA for molecular analysis.
In this study, the utility of RDTs for molecular analysis and the performance of 
different methods for whole genome amplification were investigated.
METHODS: Positive P. falciparum RDTs were collected from Kayin, Myanmar from
August 2014 to January 2016. The RDT samples were stored for 6 months, 9 months, 
20 months, 21 months, and 32 months before DNA extraction and subsequent
molecular analysis of P. falciparum kelch 13 (pfkelch13) mutations, P. falciparum
multidrug resistance 1 (pfmdr1), and P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pfplasmepsin2)
gene amplification. In addition, performance of four whole genome amplification
(WGA) kits were compared, including REPLI-g®, MALBACTM, PicoPLEX®, and
GenomePlex®, for which DNA quantity and quality were compared between original
DNA and post-WGA products.
RESULTS: The proportion of successful amplification of the different molecular
markers was similar between blood spots analysed from RDTs stored for 6, 9, 20,
21, or 32 months. Successful amplification was dependent on the molecular markers
fragment length (p value < 0.05): 18% for a 1245 bp fragment of pfkelch13, 71%
for 364 bp of pfkelch13, 81% for 87 bp of pfmdr1, 81% for 108 bp of
pfplasmepsin2. Comparison of the four WGA assay kits showed that REPLI-g®,
MALBACTM, and PicoPLEX® increased the quantity of DNA 60 to 750-fold, whereas the
ratio of parasite DNA amplification over human DNA was most favourable for
MALBAC®. Sequencing results of pfkelch13, P. falciparum chloroquine resistance
transporter (pfcrt), P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (pfdhfr) and six
microsatellite markers assessed from the post-WGA product was the same as from
the original DNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood spots from RDTs are a good source for molecular analysis of P.
falciparum, even after storage up to 32 months. WGA of RDT-derived parasite DNA
reliably increase DNA quantity with sufficient quality for molecular analysis of 
resistance markers.
