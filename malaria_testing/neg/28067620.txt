Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is believed to confer
protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria, but the precise nature of the
protective effecthas proved difficult to define as G6PD deficiency has multiple
allelic variants with different effects in males and females, and it has
heterogeneous effects on the clinical outcome of P. falciparum infection. Here we
report an analysis of multiple allelic forms of G6PD deficiency in a large
multi-centre case-control study of severe malaria, using the WHO classification
of G6PD mutations to estimate each individual's level of enzyme activity from
their genotype. Aggregated across all genotypes, we find that increasing levels
of G6PD deficiency are associated with decreasing risk of cerebral malaria, but
with increased risk of severe malarial anaemia. Models of balancing selection
based on these findings indicate that an evolutionary trade-off between different
clinical outcomes of P. falciparum infection could have been a major cause of the
high levels of G6PD polymorphism seen in human populations.
