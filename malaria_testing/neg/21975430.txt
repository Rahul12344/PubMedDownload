To identify genetic effects modulating the blood stage replication of the
malarial parasite, we phenotyped a group of 25 inbred mouse strains for
susceptibility to Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi AS infection (peak parasitemia,
survival). A broad spectrum of responses was observed, with strains such as
C57BL/6J being the most resistant (low parasitemia, 100% survival) and strains
such as NZW/LacJ and C3HeB/FeJ being extremely susceptible (very high parasitemia
and uniform lethality). A number of strains showed intermediate phenotypes and
gender-specific effects, suggestive of rich genetic diversity in response to
malaria in inbred strains. An F2 progeny was generated from SM/J (susceptible)
and C57BL/6J (resistant) parental strains, and was phenotyped for susceptibility 
to P. chabaudi chabaudi AS. A whole-genome scan in these animals identified the
Char1 locus (LOD=7.40) on chromosome 9 as a key regulator of parasite density and
pointed to a conserved 0.4-Mb haplotype at Char1 that segregates with
susceptibility/resistance to infection. In addition, a second locus was detected 
in [SM/J Ã— C57BL/6J] F2 mice on the X chromosome (LOD=4.26), which was given the 
temporary designation Char11. These studies identify a conserved role of Char1 in
regulating response to malaria in inbred mouse strains, and provide a prioritized
0.4-Mb interval for the search of positional candidates.
