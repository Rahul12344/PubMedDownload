BACKGROUND: Anopheles sacharovi is a dominant malaria vector species in South
Europe and the Middle East which has a highly plastic behaviour at both adult and
larval stages. Such plasticity has prevented this species from eradication by
several anti-vector campaigns. The development of new genome-based strategies for
vector control will benefit from genome sequencing and physical chromosome
mapping of this mosquito. Although a cytogenetic photomap for chromosomes from
salivary glands of An. sacharovi has been developed, no cytogenetic map suitable 
for physical genome mapping is available.
METHODS: Mosquitoes for this study were collected at adult stage in animal
shelters in Armenia. Polytene chromosome preparations were prepared from ovarian 
nurse cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using PCR
amplified probes.
RESULTS: This study constructed a high-quality standard photomap for polytene
chromosomes from ovarian nurse cells of An. sacharovi. Following the previous
nomenclature, chromosomes were sub-divided into 39 numbered and 119 lettered
sub-divisions. Chromosomal landmarks for the chromosome recognition were
described. Using FISH, 4 PCR-amplified genic probes were mapped to the
chromosomes. The positions of the probes demonstrated gene order reshuffling
between An. sacharovi and Anopheles atroparvus which has not been seen
cytologically. In addition, this study described specific chromosomal landmarks
that can be used for the cytotaxonomic diagnostics of An. sacharovi based on the 
banding pattern of its polytene chromosomes.
CONCLUSIONS: This study constructed a high-quality standard photomap for ovarian 
nurse cell chromosomes of An. sacharovi and validated its utility for physical
genome mapping. Based on the map, cytotaxonomic features for identification of
An. sacharovi have been described. The cytogenetic map constructed in this study 
will assist in creating a chromosome-based genome assembly for this mosquito and 
in developing cytotaxonomic tools for identification of other species from the
Maculipennis group.
