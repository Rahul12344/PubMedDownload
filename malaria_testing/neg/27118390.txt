BACKGROUND: The zoonotic malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi has become an
emerging threat to South East Asian countries particular in Malaysia. A recent
study from Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) discovered two distinct normocyte binding
protein xa (Pknbpxa) types of P. knowlesi. In the present study, the Pknbpxa of
clinical isolates from Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah (Malaysian Borneo) were
investigated for the presence of Pknbpxa types and natural selection force acting
on the gene.
METHOD: Blood samples were collected from 47 clinical samples from Peninsular
Malaysia (n = 35) and Sabah (Malaysian Borneo, n = 12) were used in the study.
The Pknbpxa gene was successfully amplified and directly sequenced from 38 of the
samples (n = 31, Peninsular Malaysia and n = 7, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo). The
Pknbpxa sequences of P. knowlesi isolates from Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) were
retrieved from GenBank and included in the analysis. Polymorphism, genetic
diversity and natural selection of Pknbpxa sequences were analysed using DNAsp v 
5.10, MEGA5. Phylogentics of Pknbpxa sequences was analysed using MrBayes v3.2
and Splits Tree v4.13.1. The pairwise F ST indices were used to determine the
genetic differentiation between the Pknbpxa types and was calculated using
Arlequin 3.5.1.3.
RESULTS: Analyses of the sequences revealed Pknbpxa dimorphism throughout
Malaysia indicating co-existence of the two types (Type-1 and Type-2) of Pknbpxa.
More importantly, a third type (Type 3) closely related to Type 2 Pknbpxa was
also detected. This third type was found only in the isolates originating from
Peninsular Malaysia. Negative natural selection was observed, suggesting
functional constrains within the Pknbpxa types.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the existence of three Pknbpxa types in
Malaysia. Types 1 and 2 were found not only in Malaysian Borneo (Sarawak and
Sabah) but also in Peninsular Malaysia. A third type which was specific only to
samples originating from Peninsular Malaysia was discovered. Further genetic
studies with a larger sample size will be necessary to determine whether natural 
selection is driving this genetic differentiation and geographical separation.
