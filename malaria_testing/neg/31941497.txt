BACKGROUND: Blackwater fever (BWF), one of the most severe and life-threatening
forms of falciparum malaria, is characterized by acute massive intravascular
haemolysis, often leading to acute renal failure. Thus far, the genetics of the
underlying susceptibility to develop BWF is not fully elucidated. Deficiency in
the MBL protein, an important component of the innate immune system, has
previously been suggested to be a susceptibility factor for the development of
severe malaria. This study aimed to evaluate the association between MBL2 gene
polymorphisms, known to affect the MBL protein level/activity, and the occurrence
of BWF among Congolese children.
METHODS: This is a case-control study. Cases were patients with BWF, whereas
controls, matched for gender and age, had uncomplicated malaria (UM). Dried blood
spot was collected for genotyping.
RESULTS: A total of 129 children were screened, including 43 BWF and 86 UM. The
common allele in BWF and UM was A, with a frequency of 76.7 and 61.0%,
respectively (OR: 2.67 (0.87-829) and p = 0.079). The frequency of the C allele
was 18.6 and 29.1% in BWF and UM groups, respectively, with p = 0.858. Not a
single D allele was encountered. Genotype AA was at higher risk for BWF whereas
genotypes A0 (AB and AC) were over-represented in UM group (OR: 0.21 (0.06-0.78))
with p = 0.019. Nine haplotypes were observed in this study: 3 high MBL
expression haplotypes and 6 low MBL expression haplotype. One new haplotype HYPC 
was observed in this study. None of these haplotypes was significantly associated
with BWF.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study is a preliminary research on MBL2 gene and
infectious diseases in DRC. The study results show a higher risk for BWF in AA.
This suggests that future studies on BWF should further investigate the
contribution of a strong immune response to the occurrence of BWF.
