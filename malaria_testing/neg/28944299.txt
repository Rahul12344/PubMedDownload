Background. Malaria control, and finally malaria elimination, requires the
identification and targeting of residual foci or hotspots of transmission.
However, the level of parasite mixing within and between geographical locations
is likely to impact the effectiveness and durability of control interventions and
thus should be taken into consideration when developing control programs.
Methods. In order to determine the geographic-genetic patterns of Plasmodium
falciparum parasite populations at a sub-national level in Kenya, we used the
Sequenom platform to genotype 111 genome-wide distributed single nucleotide
polymorphic (SNP) positions in 2486 isolates collected from children in 95
primary schools in western Kenya. We analysed these parasite genotypes for
genetic structure using principal component analysis and assessed local and
global clustering using statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation. We
further examined the region for spatial barriers to parasite movement as well as 
directionality in the patterns of parasite movement. Results. We found no
evidence of population structure and little evidence of spatial autocorrelation
of parasite genotypes (correlation coefficients <0.03 among parasite pairs in
distance classes of 1km, 2km and 5km; p value<0.01). An analysis of the
geographical distribution of allele frequencies showed weak evidence of variation
in distribution of alleles, with clusters representing a higher than expected
number of samples with the major allele being identified for 5 SNPs. Furthermore,
we found no evidence of the existence of spatial barriers to parasite movement
within the region, but observed directional movement of parasites among schools
in two separate sections of the region studied. Conclusions. Our findings
illustrate a pattern of high parasite mixing within the study region. If this
mixing is due to rapid gene flow, then "one-off" targeted interventions may not
be currently effective at the sub-national scale in Western Kenya, due to the
high parasite movement that is likely to lead to re-introduction of infection
from surrounding regions. However repeated targeted interventions may reduce
transmission in the surrounding regions.
