Synthetic peptides have become invaluable biomedical research and medicinal
chemistry tools for studying functional roles, i.e., binding or proteolytic
activity, naturally-occurring regions' immunogenicity in proteins and developing 
therapeutic agents and vaccines. Synthetic peptides can mimic protein sites;
their structure and function can be easily modulated by specific amino acid
replacement. They have major advantages, i.e., they are cheap, easily-produced
and chemically stable, lack infectious and secondary adverse reactions and can
induce immune responses via T- and B-cell epitopes. Our group has previously
shown that using synthetic peptides and adopting a functional approach has led to
identifying Plasmodium falciparumconserved regions binding to host cells.
Conserved high activity binding peptides' (cHABPs) physicochemical, structural
and immunological characteristics have been taken into account for properly
modifying and converting them into highly immunogenic, protection-inducing
peptides (mHABPs) in the experimental Aotus monkey model. This article describes 
stereo-electron and topochemical characteristics regarding major
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mHABP-T-cell receptor (TCR) complex formation.
Some mHABPs in this complex inducing long-lasting, protective immunity have been 
named immune protection-inducing protein structures (IMPIPS), forming the subunit
components in chemically synthesized vaccines. This manuscript summarizes this
particular field and adds our recent findings concerning intramolecular
interactions (H-bonds or π-interactions) enabling proper IMPIPS structure as well
as the peripheral flanking residues (PFR) to stabilize the MHCII-IMPIPS-TCR
interaction, aimed at inducing long-lasting, protective immunological memory.
