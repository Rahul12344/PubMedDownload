A chromosome inversion can spread when it captures locally adapted alleles or
when it is introduced into a species by hybridization with adapted alleles that
were previously absent. We present a model that shows how both processes can
cause a species range to expand. Introgression of an inversion that carries
novel, locally adapted alleles is a particularly powerful mechanism for range
expansion. The model supports the earlier proposal that introgression of an
inversion triggered a large range expansion of a malaria mosquito. These results 
suggest a role for inversions as cassettes of genes that can accelerate
adaptation by crossing species boundaries, rather than protecting genomes from
introgression.
