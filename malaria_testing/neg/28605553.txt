Genetic factors are associated with susceptibility to many infectious diseases
and may be determinants of clinical progression. Gene copy number variation (CNV)
has been shown to be associated with phenotypes of numerous diseases, including
malaria. We quantified gene copy numbers of the pyruvate kinase, liver, and red
blood cell (PKLR) gene as well as of the Fcγ receptor 2A and Fcγ receptor 2C
(FCGR2A, FCGR2C) and Fcγ receptor 3 (FCGR3) genes using real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays in Gabonese children with severe (n = 
184) or and mild (n = 189) malaria and in healthy Gabonese and white individuals 
(n = 76 each). The means of PKLR, FCGR2A, FCGR2C, and FCGR3 copy numbers were
significantly higher among children with severe malaria compared to those with
mild malaria (P < .002), indicating that a surplus of copies of those genes is
significantly associated with malaria severity. Copy numbers of the FCGR2A and
FCGR2C genes were significantly lower (P = .005) in Gabonese individuals compared
with white individuals. In conclusion, CNV of the PKLR, FCGR2A, FCGR2C, and FCGR3
genes is associated with malaria severity, and our results provide evidence for a
role of CNV in host responses to malaria.
