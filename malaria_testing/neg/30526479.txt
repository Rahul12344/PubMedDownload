BACKGROUND: Malaria parasites are genetically polymorphic and phenotypically
plastic. In studying transcriptome variation among parasites from different
infections, it is challenging to overcome potentially confounding technical and
biological variation between samples. We investigate variation in the major human
parasite Plasmodium falciparum, generating RNA-seq data on multiple independent
replicate sample preparations of merozoite-containing intra-erythrocytic
schizonts from a panel of clinical isolates and from long-term laboratory-adapted
clones, with a goal of robustly identifying differentially expressed genes.
RESULTS: Analysis of biological sample replicates shows that increased numbers
improve the true discovery rate of differentially expressed genes, and that six
independent replicates of each parasite line allowed identification of most
differences that could be detected with larger numbers. For highly expressed
genes, focusing on the top quartile at schizont stages, there was more power to
detect differences. Comparing cultured clinical isolates and laboratory-adapted
clones, genes more highly expressed in the laboratory-adapted clones include
those encoding an AP2 transcription factor (PF3D7_0420300), a ubiquitin-binding
protein and two putative methyl transferases. In contrast, higher expression in
clinical isolates was seen for the merozoite surface protein gene dblmsp2,
proposed to be a marker of schizonts forming merozoites committed to sexual
differentiation. Variable expression was extremely strongly, but not exclusively,
associated with genes known to be targeted by Heterochromatin Protein 1. Clinical
isolates show variable expression of several known merozoite invasion ligands, as
well as other genes for which new RT-qPCR assays validate the quantitation and
allow characterisation in samples with more limited material. Expression levels
of these genes vary among schizont preparations of different clinical isolates in
the first ex vivo cycle in patient erythrocytes, but mean levels are similar to
those in continuously cultured clinical isolates.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of multiple biological sample replicates greatly improves
identification of genes variably expressed between different cultured parasite
lines. Clinical isolates recently established in culture show differences from
long-term adapted clones in transcript levels of particular genes, and are
suitable for analyses requiring biological replicates to understand parasite
phenotypes and variable expression likely to be relevant in nature.
