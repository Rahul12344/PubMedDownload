Malaria morbidity and mortality have decreased gradually in the Greater Mekong
Subregion (GMS). Presently, WHO sets a goal to eliminate malaria by 2030 in the
GMS. However, drug-resistant malaria has been reported from several endemic
areas. To achieve the goal of elimination, the status of the emergence and spread
of drug resistance should be monitored. In this study, the genotype of the
Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine (CQ) resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) and 6 
microsatellite DNA loci flanking the gene were examined. P. falciparum isolates
(n = 136) was collected from malaria patients in Thailand (n = 50, 2002-2005),
Vietnam (n = 39, 2004), Laos (n = 15, 2007) and Cambodia (n = 32, 2009). Amino
acid sequences at codons 72-76 on the gene were determined. All of the isolates
from Thailand were CQ-resistant (CVIET), as were all of the isolates from
Cambodia (CVIET, CVIDT). Thirteen of the 15 isolates (87%) from Laos were
CQ-resistant (CVIET, CVIDT), whereas the other 2 (13%) were CQ-susceptible
(CVMNK). In contrast, 27 of the 39 isolates (69%) from Vietnam were
CQ-susceptible (CVMNK), whereas the other 12 (31%) were CQ-resistant (CVIET,
CVIDT, CVMDT) or mixed (CVMNK/CVIDT). The mean of expected heterozygosity of the 
microsatellite loci was 0.444 in the Thai population, 0.482 in the Cambodian
population, and 0.734 in the Vietnamese population. Genetic diversity in the Thai
population was significantly lower than that in the Vietnamese population. These 
results suggested that chloroquine selective pressure on P. falciparum
populations is heterogeneous in the GMS. Therefore, further examination to
understand the mechanisms behind the emergence and spread of drug-resistant
malaria are needed.
