The thalassemias and other inherited disorders of hemoglobin are likely to remain
a serious global health problem for the foreseeable future. Currently, they are
most frequent in the tropical belt; an assessment of their true frequency and the
likely cost of management for the governments of these countries will require a
form of micromapping. Over recent years, there has been major progress toward
better prevention and management of the thalassemias in richer countries; it is
likely that, using the tools of molecular genetics, they will eventually be
completely curable, although this is probably a long time in the future.
