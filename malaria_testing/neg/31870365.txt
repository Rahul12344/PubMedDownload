BACKGROUND: A clear understanding of mosquito biology is fundamental to the
control efforts of mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria. Mosquito
mark-release-recapture (MMRR) experiments are a popular method of measuring the
survival and dispersal of disease vectors; however, examples with African malaria
vectors are limited. Ethical and technical difficulties involved in carrying out 
MMRR studies may have held back research in this area and, therefore, a device
that marks mosquitoes as they emerge from breeding sites was developed and
evaluated to overcome the problems of MMRR.
METHODS: A modified self-marking unit that marks mosquitoes with fluorescent
pigment as they emerge from their breeding site was developed based on a previous
design for Culex mosquitoes. The self-marking unit was first evaluated under
semi-field conditions with laboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis to determine
the marking success and impact on mosquito survival. Subsequently, a field
evaluation of MMRR was conducted in Yombo village, Tanzania, to examine the
feasibility of the system.
RESULTS: During the semi-field evaluation the self-marking units successfully
marked 86% of emerging mosquitoes and there was no effect of fluorescent marker
on mosquito survival. The unit successfully marked wild male and female Anopheles
gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) in sufficiently large numbers to justify its use in
MMRR studies. The estimated daily survival probability of An. gambiae s.l. was
0.87 (95% CI 0.69-1.10) and mean dispersal distance was 579 m (95% CI 521-636 m).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the successful use of a self-marking device 
in an MMRR study with African malaria vectors. This method may be useful in
investigating population structure and dispersal of mosquitoes for deployment and
evaluation of future vector control tools, such as gene drive, and to better
parameterize mathematical models.
