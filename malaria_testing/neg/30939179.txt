BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, a rapid decline of P. falciparum malaria cases has been
documented in the past years, the number of Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases
has rapidly decreased passing from 19.638 in 2012 to 4.073 cases in 2016.
Concomitantly, the spread of artemisinin resistance markers is raising concern on
the future efficacy of the ACTs. An evaluation of the clinical impact of the
artemisinin resistance markers is therefore of interest.
METHODS: The clinical effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine therapy
(DHA-PPQ) has been evaluated in three districts characterized by different rates 
of ART resistance markers: K13(C580Y) mutation and delayed parasite clearance on 
day 3 (DPC3). Patients were stratified in 3 groups a) no markers, b) one marker
(suspected resistance), c) co-presence of both markers (confirmed resistance). In
the studied areas, the clinical effectiveness of DHA-PPQ has been estimated as
malaria recrudescence within 60 days.
RESULTS: The rate of K13(C580Y) ranged from 75.8% in Krong Pa to 1.2% in Huong
Hoa district. DPC3 prevalence was higher in Krong Pa than in Huong Hoa (86.2% vs 
39.3%). In the two districts, the prevalence of confirmed resistance was found in
69.0% and 1.2% of patients, respectively. In Thuan Bac district, we found
intermediate prevalence of confirmed resistance. Treatment failure was not
evidenced in any district. PPQ resistance was not evidenced. Confirmed resistance
was associated to the persistence of parasites on day 28 and to 3.4-fold higher
parasite density at diagnosis. The effectiveness of malaria control strategies
was very high in the studied districts.
CONCLUSION: No treatment failure has been observed in presence of high prevalence
of ART resistance and in absence of PPQ resistance. K13(C580Y) was strongly
associated to higher parasitemia at admission, on days 3 and 28. Slower parasite 
clearance was also observed in younger patients.
