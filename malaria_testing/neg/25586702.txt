Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily
and participate in diverse cellular processes including host-pathogen
interactions. ICAM-1 is expressed on various cell types including macrophages,
whereas ICAM-4 is restricted to red blood cells. Here we report the
identification of an 11-kDa synthetic protein, M5, that binds to human ICAM-1 and
ICAM-4, as shown by in vitro interaction studies, surface plasmon resonance and
immunolocalization. M5 greatly inhibits the invasion of macrophages and
erythrocytes by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum,
respectively. Pharmacological and siRNA-mediated inhibition of ICAM-1 expression 
also results in reduced M. tuberculosis invasion of macrophages. ICAM-4 binds to 
P. falciparum merozoites, and the addition of recombinant ICAM-4 to parasite
cultures blocks invasion of erythrocytes by newly released merozoites. Our
results indicate that ICAM-1 and ICAM-4 play roles in host cell invasion by M.
tuberculosis and P. falciparum, respectively, either as receptors or as crucial
accessory molecules.
