BACKGROUND: Acquired antibodies are important in human immunity to malaria, but
key targets remain largely unknown. Plasmodium falciparum
reticulocyte-binding-homologue-4 (PfRh4) is important for invasion of human
erythrocytes and may therefore be a target of protective immunity.
METHODS: IgG and IgG subclass-specific responses against different regions of
PfRh4 were determined in a longitudinal cohort of 206 children in Papua New
Guinea (PNG). Human PfRh4 antibodies were tested for functional
invasion-inhibitory activity, and expression of PfRh4 by P. falciparum isolates
and sequence polymorphisms were determined.
RESULTS: Antibodies to PfRh4 were acquired by children exposed to P. falciparum
malaria, were predominantly comprised of IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, and were
associated with increasing age and active parasitemia. High levels of antibodies,
particularly IgG3, were strongly predictive of protection against clinical
malaria and high-density parasitemia. Human affinity-purified antibodies to the
binding region of PfRh4 effectively inhibited erythrocyte invasion by P.
falciparum merozoites and antibody levels in protected children were at
functionally-active concentrations. Although expression of PfRh4 can vary, PfRh4 
protein was expressed by most isolates derived from the cohort and showed limited
sequence polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that PfRh4 is a target of antibodies that
contribute to protective immunity to malaria by inhibiting erythrocyte invasion
and preventing high density parasitemia. These findings advance our understanding
of the targets and mechanisms of human immunity and evaluating the potential of
PfRh4 as a component of candidate malaria vaccines.
