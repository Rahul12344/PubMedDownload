Background: Despite recommendation from the World Health Organization that all
malaria suspected patients undergo a parasitological confirmation using rapid
diagnostic test or light microscopy prior to treatment, health facilities in
remote malaria endemic settings sometimes resort to presumptive diagnosis of
malaria for clinical management for various reasons. Following observation of
this practice, we undertook a cross-sectional study aimed at comparing
presumptive diagnosis based on axillary temperature, SD Bioline™ rapid test, and 
light microscopy as strategies for malaria diagnosis in the coastal region of
Mutengene in the South West of Cameroon with the overall goal of supporting
improved malaria diagnosis at local levels.
Methodology: Venous blood from 320 participants was used to detect the presence
of malaria parasite using SD Bioline™ mRDT and Giemsa stained microscopy or
spotted on filter paper for PCR amplification of the 18s rRNA gene of Plasmodium 
sp following standard procedures. The axillary temperature of each participant
was also measured. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values and their 
confidence intervals were determined for each of the methods with PCR as the
reference. The area under the curve was used to estimate accuracy of diagnostic
method and compared between test method using the X2 test with P<0.05 considered 
significant.
Results: The overall diagnostic sensitivities of presumptive diagnosis using
axillary temperature, light microscopy, and SD Bioline™ were observed to be
74.30% (95%CI: 67.90-80.01), 94.86% (95%CI: 90.99-97.41), and 95.33% (95%CI:
91.57-97.74), respectively, and their respective diagnostic specificities were
53.77% (95%CI: 43.82-63.51), 94.34% (95%CI: 88.09-97.87), and 94.34%(95%CI:
88.09-97.89). SD Bioline™ had a diagnostic sensitivity of 91.80% [95%CI:
81.90-97.28] at a parasitaemia of less than 500 parasites/μl of blood but a
sensitivity of 100% for parasite counts above 500 parasites/μl of blood. The
predictive values of the positive test were highly comparable between light
microscopy (90.09%, [95%CI: 83.61-94.18]) and SD Bioline™ mRDT (90.91%, [95%CI:
84.50-94.83]), P=0.98 with kappa values of 0.898 but lower for presumptive
diagnosis (50.89%, [95%CI: 43.72-58.03]), P<0.0001, and kappa value of 0.277.
Perfect agreement was observed between SD Bioline™ mRDT and light microscopy
(Cohen kappa= 0.924).
Conclusions: The study showed that SD Bioline™ was as good as light microscopy in
the diagnosis of malaria in remote areas of perennial transmission in South West 
Cameroon. This study equally revealed the limitations of presumptive diagnosis of
malaria (as opposed to the use of RDTs or microscopy). Efforts should be made in 
such areas to promote parasitological confirmation of malaria using quality
assured rapid tests or light microscopy for case management of malaria. The
presence of nonnegligible levels of Plasmodium ovale in this study area indicate 
that treatment guidelines may require revision if same trend is proven in several
other areas of same ecology.
