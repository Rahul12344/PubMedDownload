BACKGROUND: The cytochrome P450 CYP2B6*6 (CYP2B6 c.516G>T; rs3745274) is one of
the genetic factors that alters the drug metabolism in antimalarial,
antiretroviral and TB first-line drugs. In Central African populations, the
distribution of the CYP2B6*6 variant is poorly documented. This study
investigated the distribution of CYP2B6 c.516G>T variant among Congolese
individuals.
METHODS: A total of 418 patients with HIV-1 mono-infection, HIV-1 and
Tuberculosis coinfection and symptomatic P. falciparum malaria were genotyped for
the CYP2B6 c.516G>T SNP using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP).
The allele frequencies and genotype distributions were determined.
RESULTS: The CYP2B6 c.516G>T was successfully analysed in 69% (288/418) of the
study participants. Among the investigated individuals, the distribution of the
major allele CYP2B6*G was 45% and the minor CYP2B6*T allele was 55%. Significant 
differences in genotype distribution were also observed among the studied
individuals. The CYP2B6*GG (rapid metabolizer) genotype was observed in 17%
(49/288) followed by CYP2B6*GT (intermediate metabolizer) 55% (159/288) and
CYP2B6*TT (poor metabolizers) 28% (80/288).
CONCLUSION: This study contributes to increasing understanding on population
pharmacogenetics and may help policy makers regulate treatment guidelines in the 
Congolese population with a high burden of HIV, Malaria and TB.
