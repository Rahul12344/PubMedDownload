From a biogeographic perspective, Africa is subdivided into distinct horizontal
belts. Human populations living along the Sahel/Savannah belt south of the Sahara
desert have often been overshadowed by extensive studies focusing on other
African populations such as hunter-gatherers or Bantu in particular. However, the
Sahel together with the Savannah bordering it in the south is a challenging
region where people had and still have to cope with harsh climatic conditions and
show resilient behaviours. Besides exponentially growing urban populations,
several local groups leading various lifestyles and speaking languages belonging 
to three main linguistic families still live in rural localities across that
region today. Thanks to several years of consistent population sampling
throughout this area, the genetic history of the African Sahelian populations has
been largely reconstructed and a deeper knowledge has been acquired regarding
their adaptation to peculiar environments and/or subsistence modes. Distinct
exposures to pathogens-in particular, malaria-likely contributed to their genetic
differentiation for HLA genes. In addition, although food-producing strategies
spread within the Sahel/Savannah belt relatively recently, during the last five
millennia according to recent archaeological and archaeobotanical studies,
remarkable amounts of genetic differences are also observed between sedentary
farmers and more mobile pastoralists at multiple neutral and selected loci,
reflecting both demographic effects and genetic adaptations to distinct cultural 
traits, such as dietary habits.
