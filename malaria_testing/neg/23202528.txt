Apoptosis and other types of regulated cell death have been defined as
fundamental processes in plant and animal development, but the occurrence of, and
possible roles for, regulated cell death in parasitic protozoa remain
controversial. A key problem has been the difficulty in reconciling the presence 
of apparent morphological markers of apoptosis and the notable absence of some of
the key executioners functioning in higher eukaryotes. Here, we review the
evidence for regulated cell death pathways in selected parasitic protozoa and
propose that cell death in these organisms be classified into just two primary
types: necrosis and incidental death. It is our opinion that dedicated molecular 
machinery required for the initiation and execution of regulated cell death has
yet to be convincingly identified.
