Novel approaches to area-wide control of vector species offer promise as
additional tools in the fight against vectored diseases. Evaluation of transgenic
insect strains aimed at field population control in disease-endemic countries may
involve international partnerships and should be done in a stepwise approach,
starting with studies in containment facilities. The preparations of both
new-build and renovated facilities are described, including working with local
and national regulations regarding land use, construction, and biosafety
requirements, as well as international guidance to fill any gaps in regulation.
The examples given are for containment categorization at Arthropod Containment
Level 2 for initial facility design, classification of wastes, and precautions
during shipping. Specific lessons were derived from preparations to evaluate
transgenic (non-gene drive) mosquitoes in West and East African countries.
Documented procedures and the use of a non-transgenic training strain for trial
shipments and culturing were used to develop competence and confidence among the 
African facility staff, and along the chain of custody for transport. This
practical description is offered to support other research consortia or
institutions preparing containment facilities and operating procedures in
conditions where research on transgenic insects is at an early stage.
