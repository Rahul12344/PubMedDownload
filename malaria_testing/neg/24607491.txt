Completion of sequencing of the Plasmodium vivax genome and transcriptome offers 
the chance to identify antigens among >5000 candidate proteins. To identify those
P. vivax proteins that are immunogenic, a total of 152 candidate proteins (160
fragments) were expressed using a wheat germ cell-free system. The results of
Western blot analysis showed that 92.5% (148/160) of the targets were expressed, 
and 96.6% (143/148) were in a soluble form with 67.7% of solubility rate. The
proteins were screened by protein arrays with sera from 22 vivax malaria patients
and 10 healthy individuals to confirm their immune profile, and 44 (27.5%,
44/160) highly reactive P. vivax antigens were identified. Overall, 5 candidates 
(rhoptry-associated membrane antigen [RAMA], Pv-fam-a and -b, EXP-1 and
hypothetical protein PVX_084775) showed a positive reaction with >80% of patient 
sera, and 21 candidates with 50% to 80%. More than 23% of the highly
immunoreactive proteins were hypothetical proteins, described for the first time 
in this study. One of the top immunogenic proteins, RAMA, was characterized and
confirmed to be a serological marker of recent exposure to P. vivax infection.
These novel immunoproteomes should greatly facilitate the identification of
promising novel malaria antigens and may warrant further study.BIOLOGICAL
SIGNIFICANCE: The establishment of high-throughput cloning and expression systems
has permitted the construction of protein arrays for proteome-wide study of
Plasmodium vivax. In this study, high-throughput screening assays have been
applied to investigate blood stage-specific immune proteomes from P. vivax. We
identified 44 antigenic proteins from the 152 putative candidates, more than 23% 
of which were hypothetical proteins described for the first time in this study.
In addition, PvRAMA was characterized further and confirmed to be a serological
marker of exposure to infections. The expression of one-third of the selected
antigenic genes were shifted between P. vivax and Plasmodium falciparum,
suggesting that these genes may represent important factors associated with P.
vivax selectivity for young erythrocytes and/or with immune evasion. These novel 
immune proteomes of the P. vivax blood stage provide a baseline for further
prospective serological marker studies in malaria. These methods could be used to
determine immunodominant candidate antigens from the P. vivax genome.
