Proliferation and differentiation inside erythrocytes are important steps in the 
life cycle of Plasmodium spp. To achieve these, the parasites export polypeptides
to the surface of infected erythrocytes; for example, to import nutrients and to 
bind to other erythrocytes and the host microvasculature. Binding is mediated by 
the adhesive polypeptides Plasmodium falciparum-encoded repetitive interspersed
families of polypeptides (RIFINs), subtelomeric variant open reading frame
(STEVOR) and P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which are
encoded by multigene families to ensure antigenic variation and evasion of host
immunity. These variant surface antigens are suggested to mediate the
sequestration of infected erythrocytes in the microvasculature and block the
blood flow when binding is excessive. In this Review, we discuss the multigene
families of surface variant polypeptides and highlight their roles in causing
severe malaria.
