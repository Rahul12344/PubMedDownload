Plasmodium falciparum has exerted tremendous selective pressure on genes that
improve survival in severe malarial infections. Systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) is an autoimmune disease that is six to eight times more prevalent in women
of African descent than in women of European descent. Here we provide evidence
that a genetic susceptibility to SLE protects against cerebral malaria. Mice that
are prone to SLE because of a deficiency in FcÎ³RIIB or overexpression of
Toll-like receptor 7 are protected from death caused by cerebral malaria.
Protection appears to be by immune mechanisms that allow SLE-prone mice better to
control their overall inflammatory responses to parasite infections. These
findings suggest that the high prevalence of SLE in women of African descent
living outside of Africa may result from the inheritance of genes that are
beneficial in the immune control of cerebral malaria but that, in the absence of 
malaria, contribute to autoimmune disease.
