BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium vivax Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (PvAMA1) is a
promising malaria vaccine candidate, however it remains unclear which regions are
naturally targeted by host immunity and whether its high genetic diversity will
preclude coverage by a monovalent vaccine. To assess its feasibility as a vaccine
candidate, we investigated the global population structure of PvAMA1.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: New sequences from Papua New Guinea (PNG,
n = 102) were analysed together with published sequences from Thailand (n = 158),
India (n = 8), Sri Lanka (n = 23), Venezuela (n = 74) and a collection of
isolates from disparate geographic locations (n = 8). A total of 92 single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified including 22 synonymous SNPs and 
70 non-synonymous (NS) SNPs. Polymorphisms and signatures of balancing (positive 
Tajima's D and low FST values) selection were predominantly clustered in domain
I, suggesting it is a dominant target of protective immune responses. To estimate
global antigenic diversity, haplotypes comprised of (i) non-singleton (n = 40)
and (ii) common (≥10% minor allele frequency, n = 23) polymorphic amino acid
sites were then analysed revealing a total of 219 and 210 distinct haplotypes,
respectively. Although highly diverse, the 210 haplotypes comprised of only
common polymorphisms were grouped into eleven clusters, however substantial
geographic differentiation was observed, and this may have implications for the
efficacy of PvAMA1 vaccines in different malaria-endemic areas. The PNG
haplotypes form a distinct group of clusters not found in any other geographic
region. Vaccine haplotypes were rare and geographically restricted, suggesting
potentially poor efficacy of candidate PvAMA1 vaccines.
CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to cover the existing global PvAMA1 diversity by 
selection of diverse alleles based on these analyses however it will be important
to first define the relationships between the genetic and antigenic diversity of 
this molecule.
