BACKGROUND: Chloroquine (CQ) was the cornerstone of anti-malarial treatment in
Africa for almost 50Â years, but has been widely withdrawn due to the emergence
and spread of resistance. Recent reports have suggested that CQ-susceptibility
may return following the cessation of CQ usage. Here, we monitor CQ sensitivity
and determine the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in the CQ resistance
transporter gene (pfcrt) of Plasmodium falciparum isolates recently imported from
Africa to China.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from falciparum malaria patients returning 
to China from various countries in Africa. Isolates were tested for their
sensitivity to CQ using the SYBR Green I test ex vivo, and for a subset of
samples, in vitro following culture adaptation. Mutations at positions 72-76 and 
codon 220 of the pfcrt gene were analyzed by sequencing and confirmed by
PCR-RFLP. Correlations between drug sensitivity and pfcrt polymorphisms were
investigated.
RESULTS: Of 32 culture adapted isolates assayed, 17 (53.1%), 6 (18.8%) and 9
(28.1%) were classified as sensitive, moderately resistant, and highly resistant,
respectively. In vitro CQ susceptibility was related to point mutations in the
pfcrt gene, the results indicating a strong association between pfcrt genotype
and drug sensitivity. A total of 292 isolates were typed at the pfcrt locus, and 
the prevalence of the wild type (CQ sensitive) haplotype CVMNK in isolates from
East, South, North, West and Central Africa were 91.4%, 80.0%, 73.3%, 53.3% and
51.7%, respectively. The only mutant haplotype observed was CVIET, and this was
almost always linked to an additional mutation at A220S.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a reduction in drug pressure following
withdrawal of CQ as a first-line drug may lead to a resurgence in CQ sensitive
parasites. The prevalence of wild-type pfcrt CQ sensitive parasites from East,
South and North Africa was higher than from the West and Central areas, but this 
varied greatly between countries. Further surveillance is required to assess
whether the prevalence of CQ resistant parasites will continue to decrease in the
absence of widespread CQ usage.
