A novel species of Henneguya was isolated from flathead catfish (Pylodictis
olivaris) captured in the upper Mississippi River near Lansing (Allamakee
County), IA, and La Crosse (La Crosse County), WI. Designated Henneguya laseeae
n. sp., this novel species is described using critical morphological features,
histology, and 18S ribosomal RNA gene sequence. Ovoid cysts, ranging from 1200 to
1800 μm in width, tended to be at filament tips or in the distal third, often
directly on the filament midline, but occasionally paramedian. Lanceolate-shaped 
myxospores were consistent with those of the genus Henneguya. The spore body was 
16.2 ± 0.5 μm (mean ± standard deviation; range = 15.1-17.0 μm) in length,
6.0 ± 0.4 μm (5.1-6.6 μm) in width, and 4.7 ± 0.2 μm (4.4-4.9 μm) thick. The two 
polar capsules at the anterior of the spore body were 5.9 ± 0.3 μm (5.3-6.3 μm)
in length and 1.8 ± 0.1 μm (1.6-2.1 μm) in width and contained six to seven turns
in the polar filament. The caudal processes tapered to fine points and were
54.3 ± 2.9 μm (49.1-61.7 μm) in length. Total spore length was 70.4 ± 3.3 μm
(64.5-79.4 μm). The spores and plasmodium of this species are of similar size and
morphology to other species of Henneguya from ictalurid fishes. Additionally, the
18S rRNA gene sequences placed this isolate within a clade populated by Henneguya
spp. from North American ictalurids. This is the first reported species of
Henneguya from flathead catfish.
