Apicomplexan parasites express various calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs),
and some of them play essential roles in invasion and egress. Five of the six
CDPKs conserved in most Apicomplexa have been studied at the molecular and
cellular levels in Plasmodium species and/or in Toxoplasma gondii parasites, but 
the function of CDPK7 was so far uncharacterized. In T. gondii, during
intracellular replication, two parasites are formed within a mother cell through 
a unique process called endodyogeny. Here we demonstrate that the knock-down of
CDPK7 protein in T. gondii results in pronounced defects in parasite division and
a major growth deficiency, while it is dispensable for motility, egress and
microneme exocytosis. In cdpk7-depleted parasites, the overall DNA content was
not impaired, but the polarity of daughter cells budding and the fate of several 
subcellular structures or proteins involved in cell division were affected, such 
as the centrosomes and the kinetochore. Overall, our data suggest that CDPK7 is
crucial for proper maintenance of centrosome integrity required for the
initiation of endodyogeny. Our findings provide a first insight into the probable
role of calcium-dependent signalling in parasite multiplication, in addition to
its more widely explored role in invasion and egress.
