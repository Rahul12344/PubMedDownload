BACKGROUND: Malaria (Plasmodium spp) remains a top cause of travel-associated
morbidity among European residents. Here, we describe recent trends of imported
malaria to Belgium and characterize the first cases of P.falciparum failure to
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT).
METHODS: National surveillance data and registers from national reference
laboratory were used to investigate malaria cases and ACT failures in the past 20
years. Recurrent infections were confirmed by pfmsp genotyping and polymorphisms 
in drug resistance-associated genes pfk13, pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfpm2, pfap2mu and
pfubp1 were determined by sequencing or quantitative PCR.
RESULTS: Annual malaria cases steadily increased in the last decade, reaching 428
in 2017 (all species). An estimated 15% of P.falciparum cases were severe.
Between 2014 and 2017, 727 P.falciparum cases were reported and six non-immune
travellers presented late recurrence. Five had hyperparasitaemia and/or signs of 
severe malaria at initial consultation. No mutations in ACT drug resistance
markers were detected, although pfcrt-pfmdr1 haplotypes associated with
lumefantrine tolerance were common.
CONCLUSIONS: The upward trend in imported malaria, the substantial proportion of 
severe cases and the emergence of ACT failures are sources of concern, although
late failures were infrequent. Genetic analysis did not support parasitological
resistance to ACT, suggesting prospective pharmacokinetic studies should assess
adequacy of partner drug dosage and duration of treatment in non-immune
populations.
