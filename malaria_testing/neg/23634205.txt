A key step for the survival of the malaria parasite is the release from and
subsequent invasion of erythrocytes by the merozoite. Differences in the
efficiency of these two linked processes have a direct impact on overall parasite
burden in the host and thereby virulence. A number of parasite proteases have
recently been shown to play important roles during both merozoite egress as well 
as merozoite invasion. The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii has been
extensively used to investigate the mechanisms of parasite virulence in vivo and 
a number of important proteins have been identified as being key contributors to 
pathology. Here we have utilized transcriptional comparisons to identify two
protease-like SERAs as playing a potential role in virulence. We show that both
SERAs are non-essential for blood stage development of the parasite though they
provide a subtle but important growth advantage in vivo. In particular SERA2
appears to be an important factor in enabling the parasite to fully utilize the
whole age repertoire of circulating erythrocytes. This work for the first time
demonstrates the subtle contributions different protease-like SERAs make to
provide the parasite with a maximal capacity to successfully maintain an
infection in the host.
