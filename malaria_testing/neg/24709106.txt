Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan which infects one-third 
of the human population. Due to its high infection prevalence, Toxoplasma offers 
an ideal system for the study of host-parasite interaction. Similar to other
eukaryotes, Toxoplasma maintains levels and localization of cytoplasmic mRNAs
throughout its life cycle as part of a gene regulation network to meet all
cellular and biochemical requirements. More recently, it was reported that the
presence of cytoplasmic mRNA granules could contribute to the parasite
pathogenesis and viability. Here we identified a novel Toxoplasma DEAD-box RNA
helicase, referred to as Toxoplasma gondiiHomolog of DOZI (TgHoDI), because of
its high homology (81%) to Plasmodium DOZI. TgHoDI is the functional ortholog of 
yeast DHH1, and its function was authenticated by complementation studies in
Δdhh1 yeast strain. We demonstrated that TgHoDI is a marker of cytoplasmic RNA
stress granules, which assemble when the parasites experience cellular stresses
and translational arrest.
