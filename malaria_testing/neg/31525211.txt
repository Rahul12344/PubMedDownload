BACKGROUND: Primaquine is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for 
radical treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria. This drug is known to provoke
acute hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency. Due to lack of data on G6PD deficiency, the use of primaquine 
has been limited in Africa. In the present study, G6PD deficiency was
investigated in blood donors of various ethnic groups living in Nouakchott, a P. 
vivax endemic area in Mauritania.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Venous blood samples from 443 healthy blood
donors recruited at the National Transfusion Center in Nouakchott were screened
for G6PD activity using the CareStart G6PD deficiency rapid diagnostic test. G6PD
allelic variants were investigated using DiaPlexC G6PD genotyping kit that
detects African (A-) and Mediterranean (B-) variants. Overall, 50 of 443 (11.3%) 
individuals (49 [11.8%] men and 1 [3.7%] woman) were phenotypically deficient.
Amongst men, Black Africans had the highest prevalence of G6PD deficiency (15 of 
100 [15%]) and White Moors the lowest (10 of 168, [5.9%]). The most commonly
observed G6PD allelic variants among 44 tested G6PD-deficient men were the
African variant A- (202A/376G) in 14 (31.8%), the Mediterranean variant B- (563T)
in 13 (29.5%), and the Betica-Selma A- (376G/968C) allelic variant in 6 (13.6%). 
The Santamaria A- variant (376G/542T) and A variant (376G) were observed in only 
one and two individuals, respectively. None of the expected variants was observed
in 8 (18.2%) of the tested phenotypically G6PD-deficient men.
CONCLUSION: This is the first published data on G6PD deficiency in Mauritanians. 
The prevalence of phenotypic G6PD deficiency was relatively high (11.3%). It was 
mostly associated with either African or Mediterranean variants, in agreement
with diverse Arab and Black African origins of the Mauritanian population.
