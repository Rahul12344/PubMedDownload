Background: Colombia began using artemisinin-based combination therapies for the 
treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in 2006. It is necessary
to implement resistance surveillance to antimalarial drugs in order to promptly
detect changes in parasite susceptibility. The aim of this study was to establish
a susceptibility baseline of P. falciparum to artemether-lumefantrine using three
monitoring tools.
Methods: Patients with uncomplicated malaria treated with artemether-lumefantrine
underwent clinical and parasitological follow-up over 28 days. Ex vivo test was
performed using the microtest technique for chloroquine, arthemeter,
dihydroartemisinin and lumefantrine. Pfmdr1 copy number and polymorphisms in
Pfk13, Pfatp6, Pfcrt and Pfmdr1 genes were analyzed.
Results: From a total of 150 screened patients, 49 completed follow-up for 28
days. All treated patients had adequate clinical and parasitological responses.
Parasitic clearance showed a drastic reduction of parasite biomass at 24 hours
and complete elimination at 48 hours. One hundred eleven isolates were processed,
all exhibited high susceptibility to artemisinins and a slight decrease in
susceptibility to lumefantrine. No genetic polymorphisms associated with
resistance to artemisinin were found.
Conclusion: This study generated a susceptibility baseline in response to therapy
with Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) with numerical reference values, which
will allow data comparison with future studies to systematically monitor changes 
in the parasite and to provide an early alert to the health authorities.
