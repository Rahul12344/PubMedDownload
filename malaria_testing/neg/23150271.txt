Plasmodium falciparum, one of the deadliest parasites on earth causes human
malaria resulting one million deaths annually. Central to the parasite
pathogenicity and morbidity is the switching of parasite virulence (var) gene
expression causing host immune evasion. The regulation of Plasmodium var gene
expression is poorly understood. The complex life cycle of Plasmodium and
mutually exclusive expression pattern of var genes make this disease difficult to
control. Recent studies have demonstrated the pivotal role of epigenetic
mechanism for control of coordinated expression of var genes, important for
various clinical manifestations of malaria. In this review, we discuss about
different Plasmodium histones and their various modifications important for gene 
expression and gene repression.Contribution of epigenetic mechanism to understand
the var gene expression is also highlighted. We also describe in details P.
falciparum nuclear architecture including heterochromatin, euchromatin and
telomeric regions and their importance in subtelomeric and centrally located var 
gene expression. Finally, we explore the possibility of using Histone Acetyl
Transferase (HAT) and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC)inhibitors against multi-drug
resistance malaria parasites to provide another line of treatment for malaria.
