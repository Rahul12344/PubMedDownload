The endosymbiont Wolbachia wAlbB induces refractoriness to Plasmodium falciparum 
in Anopheles stephensi, the primary mosquito vector of human malaria in the
Middle East and South Asia. However, it remains unknown whether such
refractoriness can be extended to other malaria species. In particular, it was
reported that under very specific conditions, wAlbB can enhance Plasmodium
infection in some hosts. Here, we measured the impact of wAlbB on the rodent
malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei in A. stephensi by comparing the load of
oocysts and sporozoites in midguts and salivary glands, respectively, between
wAlbB-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes. To investigate whether wAlbB modulated
mosquito immune defense against parasites, we compared the expression of the
immune genes, which were previously reported to involve in antimalarial response,
in both midguts and the remaining carcass tissues of mosquitoes. The stable
association of wAlbB with A. stephensi resulted in reduction of parasites by more
than half at the oocyst stage, and up to 91.8% at the sporzoite stage. The
anti-plasmodium immune genes, including TEP1, LRIM1, Toll pathway gene Rel1 and
the effector Defensin 1, were induced by wAlbB in different mosquito body
tissues. These findings suggest that immune priming is a potential cause of
wAlbB-mediated antimalarial response in A. stephensi. More importantly, no
evidence was found for any enhancement of Plasmodium infection in A. stephensi
stably infected with wAlbB. We discuss these findings with possible
implementations of Wolbachia for malaria control in disease endemic areas.
