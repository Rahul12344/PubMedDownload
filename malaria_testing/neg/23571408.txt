A critical stage in malaria transmission occurs in the Anopheles mosquito midgut,
when the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, ingested with blood, first makes contact
with the gut epithelial surface. To understand the response mechanisms within the
midgut environment, including those influenced by resident microbiota against
Plasmodium, we focus on a midgut bacteria species' intra-specific variation that 
confers diversity to the mosquito's competency for malaria transmission. Serratia
marcescens isolated from either laboratory-reared mosquitoes or wild populations 
in Burkina Faso shows great phenotypic variation in its cellular and structural
features. Importantly, this variation is directly correlated with its ability to 
inhibit Plasmodium development within the mosquito midgut. Furthermore, this
anti-Plasmodium function conferred by Serratia marcescens requires increased
expression of the flagellum biosynthetic pathway that is modulated by the
motility master regulatory operon, flhDC. These findings point to new strategies 
for controlling malaria through genetic manipulation of midgut bacteria within
the mosquito.
