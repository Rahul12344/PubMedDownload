BACKGROUND: Toll-interacting protein is a negative regulator in the TLR signaling
cascade, particularly by impeding the TLR2 and, TLR4 pathway. Recently, TOLLIP
was shown to regulate human TLR signaling pathways. Two common TOLLIP
polymorphisms (rs5743899 and rs3750920) were reported to be influencing IL-6, TNF
and IL-10 expression. In this study, TOLLIP variants were investigated to their
relation to Plasmodium vivax malaria in the Brazilian Amazon.
METHODS: This cohort study was performed in the municipalities of Careiro and,
Manaus, in Western Brazilian Amazon. A total of 319 patients with P. vivax
malaria and, 263 healthy controls with no previous history of malaria were
included in the study. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood collected on filter
paper, using the QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit, according to the manufacturer's suggested 
protocol. The rs5743899 and rs3750920 polymorphisms of the TOLLIP gene were typed
by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: Homozygous individuals for the rs3750920 T allele gene had twice the
risk of developing malaria when compared to individuals homozygous for the C
allele (OR 2.0 [95% CI 1.23-3.07]; p = 0.004). In the dominant model, carriers
the C allele indicates protection to malaria, carriers of the C allele were
compared to individuals with the T allele, and the difference is highly
significant (OR 0.52 [95% CI 0.37-0.76]; p = 0.0006). The linkage disequilibrium 
between the two polymorphisms was weak (r2 = 0.037; D' = 0.27).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that genes involved in the TLRs-pathway may
be involved in malaria susceptibility. The association of the TOLLIP rs3750920 T 
allele with susceptibility to malaria further provides evidence that genetic
variations in immune response genes may predispose individuals to malaria.
