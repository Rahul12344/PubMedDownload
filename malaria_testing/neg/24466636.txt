Did Tutankhamun suffer from hypophosphatasia?--A hypothetical approach.

Brandt G.

Between 2005 and 2010 new efforts have been undertaken to shed light on the life 
and death of Tutankhamun--for the first time with the aid of modern scientific
methods like CT scans and DNA analysis. The publication of a paper in the Journal
of the American Medical Association in February 2010, that stated the famous
pharaoh died of a combination of Malaria and KÃ¶hler's disease II, provoked
objections from various sides. Based on new and existing findings, the author has
developed the theory that Tutankhamun might, instead, have suffered from
hypophosphatasia, an inherited metabolic disorder that affects especially the
musculo-skeletal system in many ways. Hypophosphatasia (HPP) can be highly
variable in its clinical manifestations and can be difficult to diagnose. The
author has compiled both medical and archaeological findings to support his
theory and suggests that existing DNA samples of Tutankhamun and other members of
his family should be tested for defects on the ALPL gene.
