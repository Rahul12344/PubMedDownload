BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in Cameroon. The study of
the genetic diversity within parasite population is essential for understanding
the mechanism underlying malaria pathology and to determine parasite clones
profile in an infection, for proper malaria control strategies. The objective of 
this study was to perform a molecular characterization of highly polymorphic
genetic markers of Plasmodium falciparum, and to determine allelic distribution
with their influencing factors valuable to investigate malaria transmission
dynamics in Cameroon.
METHODS: A total of 350 P. falciparum clinical isolates were characterized by
genotyping block 2 of msp-1, block 3 of msp-2, and region II of glurp gene using 
nested PCR and DNA sequencing between 2012 and 2013.
RESULTS: A total of 5 different genotypes with fragment sizes ranging from 597 to
817 bp were recorded for GLURP. Overall, 16 MSP-1 genotypes, including K1, MAD20 
and RO33 were identified, ranging from 153 to 335 bp. A peculiarity about this
study is the RO33 monomorphic pattern revealed among the Pfmsp-1 allelic type.
Again, this study identified 27 different Pfmsp-2 genotypes, ranging from 140 to 
568 bp in size, including 15 belonging to the 3D7-type and 12 to the FC27 allelic
families. The analysis of the MSP-1 and MSP-2 peptides indicates that the region 
of the alignment corresponding K1 polymorphism had the highest similarity in the 
MSP1and MSP2 clade followed by MAD20 with 93% to 100% homology. Therefore,
population structure of P. falciparum isolates is identical to that of other
areas in Africa, suggesting that vaccine developed with K1 and MAD20 of Pfmsp1
allelic variant could be protective for Africa children but these findings
requires further genetic and immunological investigations. The multiplicity of
infection (MOI) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) for Pfmsp-2 loci (3.82), as
compare with Pfmsp-1 (2.51) and heterozygotes ranged from 0.55 for Pfmsp-1 to
0.96 for Pfmsp-2.
CONCLUSION: High genetic diversity and allelic frequencies in P. falciparum
isolates indicate a persisting high level of transmission. This study advocate
for an intensification of the malaria control strategies in Cameroon. Trial
registration This study was approved by Cameroon National Ethics Committee. It is
a randomized controlled trial retrospectively registered in NIH U.S. National
Library of Medicine, ClinicalTrials.gov on the 28/11/2016 at
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02974348 with the registration number
NCT02974348.
