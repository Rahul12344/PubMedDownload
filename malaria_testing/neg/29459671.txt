The Plasmodium falciparum variant surface antigen PfEMP1 expressed on the surface
of infected erythrocytes is thought to play a major role in the pathology of
severe malaria. As the sequence pool of the var genes encoding PfEMP1 expands
there are opportunities, despite the high degree of sequence diversity
demonstrated by this gene family, to reconstruct full-length var genes from small
sequence tags generated from patient isolates. To test whether this is possible
we have used a set of recently laboratory adapted ICAM-1-binding parasite
isolates to generate sequence tags and, from these, to identify the full-length
PfEMP1 being expressed by them. In a subset of the strains available we were able
to produce validated, full-length var gene sequences and use these to conduct
biophysical analyses of the ICAM-1 binding regions.
