Parasitic infections remain one of the most pressing global health concerns of
our day, affecting billions of people and producing unsustainable economic
burdens. The rise of drug-resistant parasites has created an urgent need to study
their biology in hopes of uncovering new potential drug targets. It has been
established that disrupting gene expression by interfering with lysine
acetylation is detrimental to survival of apicomplexan (Toxoplasma gondii and
Plasmodium spp.) and kinetoplastid (Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma spp.)
parasites. As "readers" of lysine acetylation, bromodomain proteins have emerged 
as key gene expression regulators and a promising new class of drug target. Here 
we review recent studies that demonstrate the essential roles played by
bromodomain-containing proteins in parasite viability, invasion, and stage
switching and present work showing the efficacy of bromodomain inhibitors as
novel antiparasitic agents. In addition, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of 
bromodomain proteins in representative pathogens, some of which possess unique
features that may be specific to parasite processes and useful in future drug
development.
