Protective antibodies in Plasmodium falciparum malaria are only acquired after
years of repeated infections. Chronic malaria exposure is associated with a large
increase in atypical memory B cells (MBCs) that resemble B cells expanded in a
variety of persistent viral infections. Understanding the function of atypical
MBCs and their relationship to classical MBCs will be critical to developing
effective vaccines for malaria and other chronic infections. We show that VH gene
repertoires and somatic hypermutation rates of atypical and classical MBCs are
indistinguishable indicating a common developmental history. Atypical MBCs
express an array of inhibitory receptors and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling is
stunted in atypical MBCs resulting in impaired B cell responses including
proliferation, cytokine production and antibody secretion. Thus, in response to
chronic malaria exposure, atypical MBCs appear to differentiate from classical
MBCs becoming refractory to BCR-mediated activation and potentially interfering
with the acquisition of malaria immunity.
