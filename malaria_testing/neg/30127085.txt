Tissue-resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells in the liver are critical for long-term
protection against pre-erythrocytic Plasmodium infection. Such protection can
usually be induced with three to five doses of i.v. administered
radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS). To simplify and accelerate vaccination,
we tested a DNA vaccine designed to induce potent T cell responses against the
SYVPSAEQI epitope of Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein. In a
heterologous "prime-and-trap" regimen, priming using gene gun-administered DNA
and boosting with one dose of RAS attracted expanding Ag-specific CD8+ T cell
populations to the liver, where they became Trm cells. Vaccinated in this manner,
BALB/c mice were completely protected against challenge, an outcome not reliably 
achieved following one dose of RAS or following DNA-only vaccination. This study 
demonstrates that the combination of CD8+ T cell priming by DNA and boosting with
liver-homing RAS enhances formation of a completely protective liver Trm cell
response and suggests novel approaches for enhancing T cell-based
pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccines.
