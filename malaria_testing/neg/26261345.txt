In regions with high malaria endemicity, the withdrawal of chloroquine (CQ) as
first-line treatment of Plasmodium falciparum infections has typically led to the
restoration of CQ susceptibility through the reexpansion of the wild-type (WT)
allele K76 of the chloroquine resistance transporter gene (pfcrt) at the expense 
of less fit mutant alleles carrying the CQ resistance (CQR) marker K76T. In
low-transmission settings, such as South America, drug resistance mutations can
attain 100% prevalence, thereby precluding the return of WT parasites after the
complete removal of drug pressure. In French Guiana, despite the fixation of the 
K76T allele, the prevalence of CQR isolates progressively dropped from >90% to
<30% during 17 y after CQ withdrawal in 1995. Using a genome-wide association
study with CQ-sensitive (CQS) and CQR isolates, we have identified a single
mutation in pfcrt encoding a C350R substitution that is associated with the
restoration of CQ susceptibility. Genome editing of the CQR reference strain 7G8 
to incorporate PfCRT C350R caused a complete loss of CQR. A retrospective
molecular survey on 580 isolates collected from 1997 to 2012 identified all C350R
mutant parasites as being CQS. This mutation emerged in 2002 and rapidly spread
throughout the P. falciparum population. The C350R allele is also associated with
a significant decrease in piperaquine susceptibility in vitro, suggesting that
piperaquine pressure in addition to potential fitness costs associated with the
7G8-type CQR pfcrt allele may have selected for this mutation. These findings
have important implications for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of
antimalarial drug resistance.
