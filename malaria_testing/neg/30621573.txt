BACKGROUND: A widely used approach in next-generation sequencing projects is the 
alignment of reads to a reference genome. Despite methodological and hardware
improvements which have enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of alignments, a
significant percentage of reads frequently remain unmapped. Usually, unmapped
reads are discarded from the analysis process, but significant biological
information and insights can be uncovered from these data. We explored the
unmapped DNA (normal and bisulfite treated) and RNA sequence reads of the great
tit (Parus major) reference genome individual. From the unmapped reads we
generated de novo assemblies, after which the generated sequence contigs were
aligned to the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database using BLAST, identifying
the closest known matching sequence.
RESULTS: Many of the aligned contigs showed sequence similarity to different bird
species and genes that were absent in the great tit reference assembly.
Furthermore, there were also contigs that represented known P. major pathogenic
species. Most interesting were several species of blood parasites such as
Plasmodium and Trypanosoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses revealed that meaningful biological information can be 
found when further exploring unmapped reads. For instance, it is possible to
discover sequences that are either absent or misassembled in the reference
genome, and sequences that indicate infection or sample contamination. In this
study we also propose strategies to aid the capture and interpretation of this
information from unmapped reads.
