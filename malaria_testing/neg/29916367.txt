Recent reports have suggested that self-propagating CRISPR-based gene drive
systems are unlikely to efficiently invade wild populations due to
drive-resistant alleles that prevent cutting. Here we develop mathematical models
based on existing empirical data to explicitly test this assumption for
population alteration drives. Our models show that although resistance prevents
spread to fixation in large populations, even the least effective drive systems
reported to date are likely to be highly invasive. Releasing a small number of
organisms will often cause invasion of the local population, followed by invasion
of additional populations connected by very low rates of gene flow. Hence,
initiating contained field trials as tentatively endorsed by the National
Academies report on gene drive could potentially result in unintended spread to
additional populations. Our mathematical results suggest that self-propagating
gene drive is best suited to applications such as malaria prevention that seek to
affect all wild populations of the target species.
