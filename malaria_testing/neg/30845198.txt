In the past few years, relative frequencies of malaria parasite species in
communities living in the Colombian Amazon riverside have changed, being
Plasmodium vivax (61.4%) and Plasmodium malariae (43.8%) the most frequent. Given
this epidemiological scenario, it is important to determine the species of
anophelines involved in these parasites' transmission. This study was carried out
in June 2016 in two indigenous communities living close to the tributaries of the
Amazon River using protected human bait. The results of this study showed a total
abundance of 1,085 mosquitos, of which 99.2% corresponded to Anopheles darlingi. 
Additionally, only two anopheline species were found, showing low diversity in
the study areas. Molecular confirmation of some individuals was then followed by 
evolutionary analysis by using the COI gene. Nested PCR was used for identifying 
the three Plasmodium species circulating in the study areas. Of the two species
collected in this study, 21.0% of the An. darlingi mosquitoes were infected with 
P. malariae, 21.9% with P. vivax and 10.3% with Plasmodium falciparum. It
exhibited exophilic and exophagic behavior in both study areas, having marked
differences regarding its abundance in each community (Tipisca first sampling
49.4%, Tipisca second sampling 39.6% and Doce de Octubre 10.9%). Interestingly,
An. mattogrossensis infected by P. vivax was found for the first time in Colombia
(in 50% of the four females collected). Analysis of An. darlingi COI gene
diversity indicated a single population maintaining a high gene flow between the 
study areas. The An. darlingi behavior pattern found in both communities
represents a risk factor for the region's inhabitants living/working near these
sites. This highlights the need for vector control efforts such as the use of
personal repellents and insecticides for use on cattle, which must be made
available in order to reduce this Anopheline's abundance.
