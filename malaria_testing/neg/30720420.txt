'Candidatus Ornithobacterium hominis' represents a new member of the
Flavobacteriaceae detected in 16S rRNA gene surveys of people from South-East
Asia, Africa and Australia. It frequently colonizes the infant nasopharynx at
high proportional abundance, and we demonstrate its presence in 42 % of
nasopharyngeal swabs from 12-month-old children in the Maela refugee camp in
Thailand. The species, a Gram-negative bacillus, has not yet been cultured, but
the cells can be identified in mixed samples by fluorescent hybridization. Here, 
we report seven genomes assembled from metagenomic data, two to improved draft
standard. The genomes are approximately 1.9 Mb, sharing 62 % average amino acid
identity with the only other member of the genus, the bird pathogen
Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale. The draft genomes encode multiple
antibiotic-resistance genes, competition factors, Flavobacterium johnsoniae-like 
gliding motility genes and a homologue of the Pasteurella multocida mitogenic
toxin. Intra- and inter-host genome comparison suggests that colonization with
this bacterium is both persistent and strain exclusive.
