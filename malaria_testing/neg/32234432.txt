Plasmodium parasites are present in a wide range of host species, some of which
tend to be more susceptible than others, potentially as an outcome of evolved
tolerance or resistance. Common starlings seem to cope with malaria infection
while common crossbills are more susceptible to the same infections. That raises 
the question if the parasites rely on the same molecular mechanisms regardless of
host species or do Plasmodium parasites change gene-expressions in accordance to 
the environment different hosts might provide? We used RNA-sequencing from
starlings and crossbills, experimentally infected with Plasmodium
homocircumflexum (lineage pCOLL4). The assembled transcriptome contained a total 
of 26,733 contigs. Parasite expression patterns differed between bird species.
Parasites had higher expression of cell-invasion genes when infecting crossbills 
compared to starlings whereas in starlings genes related to apoptosis or/and
oxidative stress showed higher expression levels. This article reveals how a
Plasmodium parasite might adjust its expression and gene function depending on
the host species infected.
