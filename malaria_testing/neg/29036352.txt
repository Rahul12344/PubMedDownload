Intersexual genetic correlations are expected to constrain the evolution of
sexual dimorphic traits, including the degree of sex-biased gene expression.
Consistent with that expectation, studies in fruit flies and birds have reported 
that genes whose expression has a strong intersexual genetic correlation (rMF)
show a lower level of sex-biased expression (SBE). However, it is known that both
rMF and SBE can be affected by the environment. It is therefore unclear whether
there is a consistent relationship between these 2 quantities across multiple
environments. In this paper, we study this relationship in the African malaria
mosquito Anopheles gambiae. We show that both rMF and SBE change between
environments. The change in SBE across environments is significantly correlated
with dN/dS: greater changes in SBE are associated with higher values of dN/dS.
Furthermore, the relationship between rMF and SBE is sensitive to the
environment. We conclude that this relationship is sufficiently plastic that
environmental effects should be considered in future studies.
