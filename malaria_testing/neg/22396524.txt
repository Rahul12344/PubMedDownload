Apicoplast, a nonphotosynthetic plastid derived from secondary symbiotic origin, 
is essential for the survival of malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium.
Elucidation of the evolution of the apicoplast genome in Plasmodium species is
important to better understand the functions of the organelle. However, the
complete apicoplast genome is available for only the most virulent human malaria 
parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Here, we obtained the near-complete apicoplast
genome sequences from eight Plasmodium species that infect a wide variety of
vertebrate hosts and performed structural and phylogenetic analyses. We found
that gene repertoire, gene arrangement, and other structural attributes were
highly conserved. Phylogenetic reconstruction using 30 protein-coding genes of
the apicoplast genome inferred, for the first time, a close relationship between 
P. ovale and rodent parasites. This close relatedness was robustly supported
using multiple evolutionary assumptions and models. The finding suggests that an 
ancestral host switch occurred between rodent and human Plasmodium parasites.
