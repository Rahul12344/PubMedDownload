BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine (CQ) denied
healthcare providers access to a cheap and effective anti-malarial drug.
Resistance has been proven to be due to point mutations on the parasite's pfcrt
gene, particularly on codon 76, resulting in an amino acid change from lysine to 
threonine. This study sought to determine the prevalence of the pfcrt K76T
mutation 13 years after CQ cessation in Msambweni, Kenya.
METHODS: Finger-prick whole blood was collected on 3MM Whatman(®) filter paper
from 99 falciparum malaria patients. Parasite DNA was extracted via the Chelex
method from individual blood spots and used as template in nested PCR
amplification of pfcrt. Apo1 restriction enzyme was used to digest the amplified 
DNA to identify the samples as wild type or sensitive at codon 76. Prevalence
figures of the mutant pfcrt 76T gene were calculated by dividing the number of
samples bearing the mutant gene with the total number of samples multiplied by
100 %. Chi square tests were used to test the significance of the findings
against previous prevalence figures.
RESULTS: Out of 99 clinical samples collected in 2013, prevalence of the mutant
pfcrt 76T gene stood at 41 %.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate a significant [χ(2) test, P ≤ 0.05 (2006 vs
2013)] reversal to sensitivity by the P. falciparum population in the study site 
compared to the situation reported in 2006 at the same study site. This could
primarily be driven by diminished use of CQ in the study area in line with the
official policy. Studies to establish prevalence of the pfcrt 76T gene could be
expanded countrywide to establish the CQ sensitivity status and predict a date
when CQ may be re-introduced as part of malaria chemotherapy.
