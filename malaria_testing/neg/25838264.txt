BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum invades human erythrocytes by using an array of
ligands that interact with several receptors, including sialic acid (SA),
complement receptor 1 (CR1), and basigin. We hypothesized that in malaria-endemic
areas, parasites vary invasion pathways under immune pressure. Therefore,
invasion mechanisms of clinical isolates collected from 3 zones of Ghana with
different levels of endemicity (from lowest to highest, Accra, Navrongo, and
Kintampo) were compared using standardized methods.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected from children aged 2-14 years in whom
malaria was diagnosed, and erythrocyte invasion phenotypes were determined using 
the enzymes neuraminidase, chymotrypsin, and trypsin, which differentially cleave
receptors from the erythrocyte surface. In addition, antibodies against CR1 and
basigin were used to determine the contributions of these receptors to invasion. 
Gene expression levels of P. falciparum invasion ligands were also examined.
RESULTS: The parasites generally expressed SA-independent invasion phenotypes
across the malaria-endemic areas, with parasites from Kintampo showing the
highest invasion rates in neuraminidase-treated erythrocytes. CR1 was a major
mediator of SA-independent invasion, while basigin was essential for both
SA-dependent and SA-independent invasion mechanisms. Furthermore, expression of
the basigin ligand PfRh5 was the best predictor of donor parasitemia.
CONCLUSIONS: Erythrocyte invasion phenotypes expressed by P. falciparum are
influenced by endemicity levels, and the PfRh5-basigin pathway is a potential
vaccine target.
