The indoleamine compound melatonin has been extensively studied in the regulation
of the circadian rhythm in nearly all vertebrates. The effects of melatonin have 
also been studied in Protozoan parasites, especially in the synchronization of
the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum via a complex downstream
signalling pathway. Melatonin activates protein kinase A (PfPKA) and requires the
activation of protein kinase 7 (PfPK7), PLC-IP3, and a subset of genes from the
ubiquitin-proteasome system. In other parasites, such as Trypanosoma cruzi and
Toxoplasma gondii, melatonin increases inflammatory components, thus amplifying
the protective response of the host's immune system and affecting parasite load. 
The development of melatonin-related indole compounds exhibiting antiparasitic
properties clearly suggests this new and effective approach as an alternative
treatment. Therefore, it is critical to understand how melatonin confers
stimulatory functions in host-parasite biology.
