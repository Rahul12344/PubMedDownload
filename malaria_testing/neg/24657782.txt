Invasive stages of Plasmodium parasites possess distinct integral and peripheral 
membrane proteins that mediate host cell attachment and invasion. P113 is an
abundant protein in detergent-resistant high molecular weight complexes in
Plasmodium schizonts, but is unusual since expression extends to gametocytes and 
sporozoites. In this study, we tested whether P113 performs important functions
for parasite propagation in Plasmodium berghei. We show that pre-erythrocytic
expression of P113 displays key signatures of upregulated in infectious
sporozoites (UIS) genes, including control by the liver stage master regulator
SLARP. Targeted gene deletion resulted in viable blood stage parasites that
displayed no signs of blood stage growth defects. p113(-) parasites propagated
normally through the life cycle until mature sporozoites, but displayed defects
during natural sporozoite transmission, leading to a delay to patency in infected
animals. By comparative in vitro and in vivo analysis of pre-erythrocytic
development and using a xeno-diagnostic test we show that ablation of P113
results in lower sporozoite to liver stage conversion and, as a consequence,
reduced merozoite output in vivo, without delaying liver stage development. We
conclude that p113 is dispensable for Plasmodium life cycle progression and plays
auxiliary roles during pre-erythrocytic development.
