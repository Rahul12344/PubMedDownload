CRISPR/Cas9 approaches are revolutionizing our ability to perform functional
genomics across a wide range of organisms, including the Plasmodium parasites
that cause malaria. The ability to deliver single point mutations, epitope tags
and gene deletions at increased speed and scale is enabling our understanding of 
the biology of these complex parasites, and pointing to potential new therapeutic
targets. In this review, we describe some of the biological and technical
considerations for designing CRISPR-based experiments, and discuss potential
future developments that broaden the applications for CRISPR/Cas9 interrogation
of the malaria parasite genome.
