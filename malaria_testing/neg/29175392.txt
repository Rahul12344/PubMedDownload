The innate immune system governed by toll-like receptors (TLRs) provides the
first line of defense against pathogens. Surface-localized TLR1 and TLR6 are
known to detect parasite components. TLR encoding genes were shown to display
signatures of recent positive selection in Europeans and might be involved in
local adaptation at immune-related genes. To verify the influence of Brazilian
population admixture on the distribution of polymorphisms in TLRs, we analyzed
the genotype frequencies of 24 polymorphisms distributed across five TLR genes in
a Southeastern Brazilian population where autochthonous cases of malaria occur in
small foci of transmission. The estimation of ancestry showed mainly European
ancestry (63%) followed by African ancestry (22%). Mean proportions of European
ancestry differed significantly between the genotypes of the TLR1 (I602S) gene
and in the TLR6 (P249S) gene. The chance of having the G allele in TLR1 gene
increases as European ancestry increases as well as the chance of having the T
allele in the TLR6 gene. The 602S allele is related to a ''hypo-responsiveness'' 
possibly explaining the high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria cases in areas of
Southeastern Brazil. Our results underline the necessity to include informative
ancestry markers in genetic association studies in order to avoid biased results.
