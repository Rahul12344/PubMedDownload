BACKGROUND: Haemoproteus and Plasmodium species are widespread avian blood
parasites. Several Plasmodium species are known for their high virulence and have
caused significant declines in naïve bird populations. The impact of closely
related Haemoproteus parasites is largely unknown. Recently we reported a lethal 
disease in two parrot aviaries caused by Haemoproteus parasites.
RESULTS: Here we show that the causative pathogen Haemoproteus minutus is
responsible for further 17 lethal outbreaks in parrot aviaries in Denmark,
Germany and Great Britain. All affected parrots are endemic to Australasia and
South America. We sequenced the cytochrome b gene from megalomeront-infected
muscle tissue of 21 parrots and identified the two lineages TUPHI01 and TURDUS2
as causative agents, commonly naturally infecting the common blackbird (Turdus
merula) and the song thrush (Turdus philomelos), respectively, in the
Palaearctic. No intraerythrocytic parasite stages were found in any of the
parrots. We failed to detect H. minutus in invasive Indian ring-necked parakeets 
(Psittacula krameri) in Germany. Together this suggests that abortive infections 
with two virulent lineages of H. minutus are lethal for naïve parrot species from
Australasia and South America. We asked whether we could detect H. minutus in New
Zealand, where its Turdus hosts were introduced in the 1800s. We therefore tested
invasive blackbirds and song thrushes, and the co-existing endemic red-fronted
parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae) population on three New Zealand islands.
No Haemoproteus spp. DNA was detected in all blood samples, indicating absence of
transmission.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that captive parrots in Europe are
threatened by two lineages of an otherwise benign parasite of Turdus spp. Aviary 
collections of parrots should be protected from Culicoides spp. vectors in
Europe. Animal trade and climate changes extending the current vector and
parasite distribution have to be considered as potential risk factors for the
introduction of the disease in naïve parrot populations.
