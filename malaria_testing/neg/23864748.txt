There are approximately 20 known species of the genus Cryptosporidium, and among 
these, 8 infect immunocompetent or immunocompromised humans. C. hominis and C.
parvum most commonly infect humans. Differentiating between them is important for
evaluating potential sources of infection. We report here the development of a
simple and accurate real-time PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism 
(RFLP) method to distinguish between C. parvum and C. hominis. Using the CP2 gene
as the target, we found that both Cryptosporidium species yielded 224 bp
products. In the subsequent RFLP method using TaqI, 2 bands (99 and 125 bp)
specific to C. hominis were detected. Using this method, we detected C. hominis
infection in 1 of 21 patients with diarrhea, suggesting that this method could
facilitate the detection of C. hominis infections.
