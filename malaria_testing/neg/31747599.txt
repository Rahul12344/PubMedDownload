Despite the key role that antibodies play in protection, the cellular processes
mediating the acquisition of humoral immunity against malaria are not fully
understood. Using an infection model of severe malaria, we find that germinal
center (GC) B cells upregulate the transcription factor T-bet during infection.
Molecular and cellular analyses reveal that T-bet in B cells is required not only
for IgG2c switching but also favors commitment of B cells to the dark zone of
the GC. T-bet was found to regulate the expression of Rgs13 and CXCR3, both of
which contribute to the impaired GC polarization observed in the absence of
T-bet, resulting in reduced IghV gene mutations and lower antibody avidity. These
results demonstrate that T-bet modulates GC dynamics, thereby promoting the
differentiation of B cells with increased affinity for antigen.
