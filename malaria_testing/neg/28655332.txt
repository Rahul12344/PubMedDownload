BACKGROUND: Lipoic acid is a cofactor for α-keto acid dehydrogenase system that
is involved in the central energy metabolism. In the apicomplexan parasite,
Plasmodium, lipoic acid protein ligase 1 (LplA1) and LplA2 catalyse the ligation 
of acquired lipoic acid to the dehydrogenase complexes in the mitochondrion. The 
enzymes LipB and LipA mediate lipoic acid synthesis and ligation to the enzymes
in the apicoplast. These enzymes in the lipoic acid metabolism machinery have
been shown to play important roles in the biology of Plasmodium parasites, but
the relationship between the enzymes is not fully elucidated.
METHODS: We used an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible transcription system to
generate transgenic P. berghei parasites in which the lplA1 gene was
conditionally knocked out (LplA1-cKO). Phenotypic changes and the lplA1 and lplA2
gene expression profiles of cloned LplA1-cKO parasites were analysed.
RESULTS: LplA1-cKO parasites showed severely impaired growth in vivo in the first
8 days of infection, and retarded blood-stage development in vitro, in the
absence of ATc. However, these parasites resumed viability in the late stage of
infection and mounted high levels of parasitemia leading to the death of the
hosts. Although lplA1 mRNA expression was regulated tightly by ATc during the
whole course of infection, lplA2 mRNA expression was significantly increased in
the late stage of infection only in the LplA1-cKO parasites that were not exposed
to ATc.
CONCLUSIONS: The lplA2 gene can be activated as an alternative pathway to
compensate for the loss of LplA1 activity and to maintain lipoic acid metabolism.
