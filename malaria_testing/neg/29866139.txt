BACKGROUND: Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most lethal outcome of Plasmodium
infection. There are clear correlations between expression of inflammatory
cytokines, severe coagulopathies, and mortality in human CM. However, the
mechanisms intertwining the coagulation and inflammation pathways, and their
roles in CM, are only beginning to be understood. In mice with T cells deficient 
in the regulatory cytokine IL-10 (IL-10 KO), infection with Plasmodium chabaudi
leads to a hyper-inflammatory response and lethal outcome that can be prevented
by anti-TNF treatment. However, inflammatory T cells are adherent within the
vasculature and not present in the brain parenchyma, suggesting a novel form of
cerebral inflammation. We have previously documented behavioral dysfunction and
microglial activation in infected IL-10 KO animals suggestive of neurological
involvement driven by inflammation. In order to understand the relationship of
intravascular inflammation to parenchymal dysfunction, we studied the congestion 
of vessels with leukocytes and fibrin(ogen) and the relationship of glial cell
activation to congested vessels in the brains of P. chabaudi-infected IL-10 KO
mice.
METHODS: Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we describe severe thrombotic
congestion in these animals. We stained for immune cell surface markers (CD45,
CD11b, CD4), fibrin(ogen), microglia (Iba-1), and astrocytes (GFAP) in the brain 
at the peak of behavioral symptoms. Finally, we investigated the roles of
inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and coagulation on the
pathology observed using neutralizing antibodies and low-molecular weight heparin
to inhibit both inflammation and coagulation, respectively.
RESULTS: Many blood vessels in the brain were congested with thrombi containing
adherent leukocytes, including CD4 T cells and monocytes. Despite containment of 
the pathogen and leukocytes within the vasculature, activated microglia and
astrocytes were prevalent in the parenchyma, particularly clustered near vessels 
with thrombi. Neutralization of TNF, or the coagulation cascade, significantly
reduced both thrombus formation and gliosis in P. chabaudi-infected IL-10 KO
mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the contribution of cytokines, coagulation,
and leukocytes within the brain vasculature to neuropathology in malaria
infection. Strikingly, localization of inflammatory leukocytes within
intravascular clots suggests a mechanism for interaction between the two cascades
by which cytokines drive local inflammation without considerable cellular
infiltration into the brain parenchyma.
