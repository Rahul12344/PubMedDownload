Can we predict the rise and spread of resistance to multi-drug therapy in a more 
predictable manner? We raise this question after analyzing over 500 Plasmodium
vivax isolates collected from different, geographically isolated regions of China
for sequence variation in and around the dhfr and dhps genes. We find: that
resistance lineages have arisen at least once in each region; that there appears 
to have been little movement of parasite populations between these areas; and
that highly resistant parasites contain dhfr and dhps alleles that are in linkage
disequilibrium. We show a direct relationship between this linkage disequilibrium
and a parasite's fitness in the absence of drug pressure. Such fitness would
increase the spread of drug resistant phenotypes and is thus a selectable trait. 
These conclusions raise questions about the appropriate use of some other drug
combinations to prevent and treat infection.
