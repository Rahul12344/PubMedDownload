Molecular Identification of Four Members of the Anopheles dirus Complex Using the
Mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit I Gene.

Precise mosquito species identification is an essential step for proper
management and control of malaria vectors. Misidentification of members in the
Anopheles dirus complex, some which are primary malaria vectors in Thailand and
mainland Southeast Asia, remains problematic because of indistinguishable or
overlapping morphological characters between sibling species. Moreover, there is 
a need for alternative methods, since the existing molecular techniques in the
literature are not entirely satisfactory in differentiating all members in the
An. dirus complex. The nucleotide polymorphisms in the mitochondrial cytochrome c
oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences were developed to identify the 4 species within
the An. dirus complex using an allele-specific (AS) multiplex polymerase chain
reaction (PCR). The identified primers amplified and clearly differentiated the 4
members of the complex found in Thailand, Anopheles dirus, An. cracens, An.
scanloni, and An. baimaii with PCR products 428/104, 236, 625, and 428 bp,
respectively. These results demonstrate that an AS-PCR based on the COI region
can accurately identify 4 members of An. dirus complex and would be useful as an 
alternative PCR-based method for accurate species identification.
