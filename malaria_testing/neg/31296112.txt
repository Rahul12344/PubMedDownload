Malaria remains a significant public health challenge and is of global
importance. Imported malaria is a growing problem in non-endemic areas throughout
the world and also in Qatar due to a massive influx of migrants from endemic
countries. Antimalarial drug resistance is an important deterrent in our fight
against malaria today. Molecular markers mirror intrinsic antimalarial drug
resistance and their changes precede clinical resistance. Thus, in the present
study, molecular markers of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (Pfdhfr and Pfdhps) and
artemisinin (PfATPase6 and Pfk13) were sequenced to determine the drug resistance
genotypes among 118 imported P. falciparum isolates in Qatar, between 2013 and
2016. All the isolates had mutant Pfdhfr alleles, with either double mutant
(51I/108N) (59.3%) or triple mutant (51I, 59R and 108N) (30.6%) genotypes. I164L 
substitution was not found in this study. In case of Pfdhps, majority of the
samples were carriers of either single (S436A/ A437G/ K540E) mutant (47.2%) or
double (S436A/K540E, A437G/K540E, K540E/A581G) mutant (39.8%). A single novel
point mutation (431V) was observed in the samples originated from Nigeria and
Ghana. Polymorphisms in PfATPase6 were absent and only one non-synonymous
mutation in Pfk13 was found at codon G453A from a sample of Kenyan origin. High
levels of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance in the present study provide
potential information about the spread of antimalarial drug resistance and will
be beneficial for the treatment of imported malaria cases in Qatar.
