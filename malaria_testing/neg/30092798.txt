BACKGROUND: Rodent malaria parasites where the gene encoding circumsporozoite
protein (CSP) has been replaced with csp genes from the human malaria parasites, 
Plasmodium falciparum or Plasmodium vivax, are used as pre-clinical tools to
evaluate CSP vaccines in vivo. These chimeric rodent parasites produce
sporozoites in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes that are capable of infecting
rodent and human hepatocytes. The availability of chimeric P. falciparum
parasites where the pfcsp gene has been replaced by the pvcsp would open up
possibilities to test P. vivax CSP vaccines in small scale clinical trials using 
controlled human malaria infection studies.
METHODS: Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing two chimeric P. falciparum parasites,
were generated, where the pfcsp gene has been replaced by either one of the two
major pvcsp alleles, VK210 or VK247. In addition, a P. falciparum parasite line
that lacks CSP expression was also generated. These parasite lines have been
analysed for sporozoite production in An. stephensi mosquitoes.
RESULTS: The two chimeric Pf-PvCSP lines exhibit normal asexual and sexual blood 
stage development in vitro and produce sporozoite-containing oocysts in An.
stephensi mosquitoes. Expression of the corresponding PvCSP was confirmed in
oocyst-derived Pf-PvCSP sporozoites. However, most oocysts degenerate before
sporozoite formation and sporozoites were not found in either the mosquito
haemocoel or salivary glands. Unlike the chimeric Pf-PvCSP parasites, oocysts of 
P. falciparum parasites lacking CSP expression do not produce sporozoites.
CONCLUSIONS: Chimeric P. falciparum parasites expressing P. vivax
circumsporozoite protein fail to produce salivary gland sporozoites. Combined,
these studies show that while PvCSP can partially complement the function of
PfCSP, species-specific features of CSP govern full sporozoite maturation and
development in the two human malaria parasites.
