Infections with helminths and Plasmodium spp. overlap in their geographical
distribution. It has been postulated that helminth infections may influence
malarial transmission by altering Plasmodium falciparum gametocytogenesis. This
cross-sectional study assessed the effect of helminth infections on P. falciparum
gametocyte carriage and on humoral immune responses to sexual stage antigens in
Gabon. Schistosoma haematobium and filarial infections as well as P. falciparum
asexual forms and gametocyte carriage were determined. The antibody responses
measured were to sexual (Pfs230, Pfs48/45) and asexual P. falciparum antigens
(AMA1, MSP1, and GLURP). A total of 287 subjects were included. The prevalence of
microscopically detectable P. falciparum asexual parasites was higher in S.
haematobium-infected subjects in comparison to their uninfected counterparts (47%
versus 26%, P = 0.003), but this was not different when filarial infections were 
considered. Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriage was similar between
Schistosoma- or filaria-infected and uninfected subjects. We observed a
significant decrease of Pfs48/45 immunoglobulin G titer in S.
haematobium-infected subjects (P = 0.037), whereas no difference was seen for
Pfs230 antibody titer, nor for antibodies to AMA1, MSP1, or GLURP. Our findings
suggest an effect of S. haematobium on antibody responses to some P. falciparum
gametocyte antigens that may have consequences for transmission-blocking
immunity.
