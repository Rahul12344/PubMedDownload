BACKGROUND: In Cambodia, elimination of artemisinin resistance through direct
elimination of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite may be the only strategy.
Prevalence and incidence at district and village levels were assessed in Chey
Saen district, Preah Vihear province, North of Cambodia. Molecular and clinical
indicators for artemisinin resistance were documented.
METHODS: A cross sectional prevalence survey was conducted at village level in
the district of Chey Saen from September to October 2014. Plasmodium spp. was
assessed with high volume quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR). Plasmodium falciparum-positive samples were screened for mutations in the
k13-propeller domain gene. Treatment effectiveness was established after 28 days 
(D28) using the same qPCR technique. Data from the provincial surveillance system
targeting symptomatic cases, supported by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), were
used to assess incidence.
RESULTS: District P. falciparum prevalence was of 0.74 % [0.41; 1.21]; village
prevalence ranged from 0 to 4.6 % [1.4; 10.5]. The annual incidence of P.
falciparum was 16.8 cases per 1000 inhabitants in the district; village incidence
ranged from 1.3 to 54.9 for 1000 inhabitants. Two geographical clusters with high
number of cases were identified by both approaches. The marker for artemisinin
resistance was found in six samples out of the 11 tested (55 %). 34.9 % of qPCR
blood analysis of symptomatic patients were still positive at D28.
CONCLUSIONS: The overall low prevalence of P. falciparum was confirmed in Chey
Saen district in Cambodia, while there were important variations between
villages. Symptomatic cases had a different pattern and were likely acquired
outside the villages. It illustrates the importance of prevalence surveys in
targeting interventions for elimination. Mutations in the k13-propeller domain
gene (C580Y), conferring artemisinin resistance, were highly prevalent in both
symptomatic and asymptomatic cases (realizing the absolute figures remain low).
Asymptomatic individuals could be an additional reservoir for artemisinin
resistance. The low effectiveness of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) for
symptomatic cases indicates that PPQ is no longer able to complement the reduced 
potency of DHA to treat falciparum malaria and highlights the need for an
alternative first-line treatment.
