Anopheles culicifacies is the main vector for transmission of Plasmodium vivax
malaria in the Indian subcontinent. A strain of An. culicifacies isolated from
its natural niche displayed complete refractoriness to P. vivax by melanotic
encapsulation of ookinetes. Prophenoloxidases are key components of the
phenoloxidase cascade that leads to recognition and melanization of invading
organisms. We isolated and cloned prophenoloxidase-encoding acppo6 gene of An.
culicifacies and analyzed its expression profile under various regimens of immune
challenge. The acppo6 was differentially expressed during various stages of
larval development. The acppo6 transcription was also up-regulated in response to
bacteria and Plasmodium vinckei petteri challenge. The transcript levels of the
acppo6 gene were higher in naive adult refractory female mosquitoes as compared
with female susceptible mosquitoes. Furthermore, the induction of acppo6 in the
susceptible strain upon Plasmodium infection was negligible as compared with that
of the refractory strain. The observation is suggestive of the role of acppo6 in 
effectuating a melanotic response in Plasmodium-incompetent naturally occurring
refractory An. culicifacies strain.
