BACKGROUND: Malaria elimination/eradication campaigns emphasize interruption of
parasite transmission as a priority strategy. Screening for new drugs and
vaccines against gametocytes is therefore urgently needed. However, current
methods for sexual stage drug assays, usually performed by counting or via
fluorescent markers are either laborious or restricted to a certain stage. Here
we describe the use of a transgenic parasite line for assaying drug sensitivity
in all gametocyte stages.
METHODS: A transgenic parasite line expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP)
under the control of the gametocyte-specific gene α-tubulin II promoter was
generated. This parasite line expresses GFP in all gametocyte stages. Using this 
transgenic line, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay to determine drug
sensitivity of all gametocyte stages, and tested the gametocytocidal activities
of four antimalarial drugs.
FINDINGS: This assay proved to be suitable for determining drug sensitivity of
all sexual stages and can be automated. A Z' factor of 0.79 ± 0.02 indicated that
this assay could be further optimized for high-throughput screening. The daily
sensitivity of gametocytes to three antimalarial drugs (chloroquine,
dihydroartemisinin and pyronaridine) showed a drastic decrease from stage III on,
whereas it remained relatively steady for primaquine.
CONCLUSIONS: A drug assay was developed to use a single transgenic parasite line 
for determining drug susceptibility of all gametocyte stages. This assay may be
further automated into a high-throughput platform for screening compound
libraries against P. falciparum gametocytes.
