BACKGROUND: The prevalence and variants of G6PD deficiency in the Plasmodium
vivax-endemic zones of Madagascar remain unknown. The admixed
African-Austronesian origins of the Malagasy population make it probable that a
heterogeneous mix of genetic variants with a spectrum of clinical severity will
be circulating. This would have implications for the widespread use of P. vivax
radical cure therapy. Two study populations in the P. vivax-endemic western
foothills region of Madagascar were selected for G6PD screening. Both the
qualitative fluorescent spot test and G6PD genotyping were used to screen all
participants.
RESULTS: A total of 365 unrelated male volunteers from the Tsiroanomandidy,
Mandoto, and Miandrivazo districts of Madagascar were screened and 12.9% were
found to be phenotypically G6PD deficient. Full gene sequencing of 95 samples
identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms, which were integrated into a
genotyping assay. Genotyping (n = 291) found one individual diagnosed with the
severe G6PD Mediterranean C563T mutation, while the remaining G6PD deficient
samples had mutations of African origin, G6PD A- and G6PD A.
CONCLUSIONS: Deployment of P. vivax radical cure in Madagascar must be
considerate of the risks presented by the observed prevalence of G6PDd
prevalence. The potential morbidity associated with cumulative episodes of P.
vivax clinical relapses requires a strategy for increasing access to safe radical
cure. The observed dominance of African G6PDd haplotypes is surprising given the 
known mixed African-Austronesian origins of the Malagasy population; more
widespread surveying of G6PDd epidemiology across the island would be required to
characterize the distribution of G6PD haplotypes across Madagascar.
