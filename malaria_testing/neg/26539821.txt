BACKGROUND: Chloroquine combined with primaquine has been the recommended
antimalarial treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria infections for six decades but
the efficacy of this treatment regimen is threatened by chloroquine resistance
(CQR). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the multidrug resistance gene,
Pvmdr1 are putative determinants of CQR but the extent of their emergence at
population level remains to be explored.
OBJECTIVE: In this study we describe the prevalence of SNPs in the Pvmdr1 among
samples collected in seven P. vivax endemic countries and we looked for molecular
evidence of drug selection by characterising polymorphism at microsatellite (MS) 
loci flanking the Pvmdr1 gene.
METHODS: We examined the prevalence of SNPs in the Pvmdr1 gene among 267 samples 
collected from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Sudan, São Tomé and
Ecuador. We measured and diversity in four microsatellite (MS) markers flanking
the Pvmdr1 gene to look evidence of selection on mutant alleles.
RESULTS: SNP polymorphism in the Pvmdr1 gene was largely confined to codons
T958M, Y976F and F1076L. Only 2.4% of samples were wildtype at all three codons
(TYF, n = 5), 13.3% (n = 28) of the samples were single mutant MYF, 63.0% of
samples (n = 133) were double mutant MYL, and 21.3% (n = 45) were triple mutant
MFL. Clear geographic differences in the prevalence of these Pvmdr mutation
combinations were observed. Significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) between
Pvmdr1 and MS alleles was found in populations sampled in Ecuador, Nepal and Sri 
Lanka, while significant LD between Pvmdr1 and the combined 4 MS locus haplotype 
was only seen in Ecuador and Sri Lanka. When combining the 5 loci, high level
diversity, measured as expected heterozygosity (He), was seen in the complete
sample set (He = 0.99), while He estimates for individual loci ranged from
0.00-0.93. Although Pvmdr1 haplotypes were not consistently associated with
specific flanking MS alleles, there was significant differentiation between
geographic sites which could indicate directional selection through local drug
pressure.
CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that Pvmdr1 mutations emerged independently
on multiple occasions even within the same population. In Sri Lanka population
analysis at multiple sites showed evidence of local selection and geographical
dispersal of Pvmdr1 mutations between sites.
