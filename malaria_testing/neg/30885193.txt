BACKGROUND: Current World Health Organization guidelines for conducting
anti-malarial drug efficacy clinical trials recommend genotyping Plasmodium
falciparum genes msp1 and msp2 to distinguish recrudescence from reinfection. A
more recently developed potential alternative to this method is a molecular
genotyping assay based on a panel of 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
markers.
METHODS: Performance parameters of these two genotyping methods were compared
using data from two recently completed drug efficacy trials. Blood samples from
two anti-malarial therapeutic trials were analysed by both msp genotyping and the
24 SNP assay. Additionally, to conserve time and resources, the statistical
program R was used to select the most informative SNPs for a set of unrelated
Malawian samples to develop a truncated SNP-based assay for the region
surrounding Blantyre, Malawi. The ability of this truncated assay to distinguish 
reinfection from recrudescence when compared to the full 24 SNP assay was then
analysed using data from the therapeutic trials.
RESULTS: A total of 360 samples were analysed; 66 for concordance of msp and SNP 
barcoding methodologies, and 294 for assessing the most informative of the 24 SNP
markers. SNP genotyping performed comparably to msp genotyping, with only one
case of disagreement among the 50 interpretable results, where the SNP assay
identified the sample as reinfection and the msp typing as recrudescence.
Furthermore, SNP typing was more robust; only 6% of samples were uninterpretable 
by SNP typing, compared to 19.7% when msp genotyping was used. For discriminating
reinfection from recrudescence, a truncated 6 SNP assay was found to perform at
95.1% the accuracy of the full 24 SNP bar code.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of SNP analysis has similar sensitivity to the standard msp 
genotyping in determining recrudescence from reinfection. Although more
expensive, SNP typing is faster and less work intensive. Limiting the assay to
those SNPs most informative in the geographical region of interest may further
decrease the workload and the cost, making this technique a feasible and
affordable alternative in drug efficacy trials.
