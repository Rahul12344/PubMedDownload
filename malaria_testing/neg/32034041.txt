Vector-borne diseases, such as dengue, Zika and malaria, are a major cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. These diseases have proven difficult to
control and currently available management tools are insufficient to eliminate
them in many regions. Gene drives have the potential to revolutionize
vector-borne disease control. This suite of technologies has advanced rapidly in 
recent years as a result of the availability of new, more efficient gene editing 
technologies. Gene drives can favorably bias the inheritance of a linked
disease-refractory gene, which could possibly be exploited (i) to generate a
vector population incapable of transmitting disease or (ii) to disrupt an
essential gene for viability or fertility, which could eventually eliminate a
population. Importantly, gene drives vary in characteristics such as their
transmission efficiency, confinability and reversibility, and their potential to 
develop resistance to the drive mechanism. Here, we discuss recent advancements
in the gene drive field, and contrast the benefits and limitations of a variety
of technologies, as well as approaches to overcome these limitations. We also
discuss the current state of each gene drive technology and the technical
considerations that need to be addressed on the pathway to field implementation. 
While there are still many obstacles to overcome, recent progress has brought us 
closer than ever before to genetic-based vector modification as a tool to support
vector-borne disease elimination efforts worldwide.
