BACKGROUND: Failed diagnoses of some falciparum malaria cases by RDTs are
constantly reported in recent years. Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein
2 (pfhpr2) gene deficiency has been found to be the major reason of RDTs failure 
in many countries. This article analysed the deletion of pfhpr2 gene of
falciparum malaria cases isolated in Yunnan Province, China.
METHODS: Blood samples from falciparum malaria cases diagnosed in Yunnan Province
were collected. Plasmodium genomic DNA was extracted and the pfhrp2 gene exon2
region was amplified via nested PCR. The haplotype of the DNA sequence, the
nucleic acid diversity index (PI) and expected heterozygosity (He) were analyzed.
Count PfHRP2 amino acid peptide sequence repeat and its times, and predict the
properties of PfHRP2 peptide chain reaction to RDTs testing.
RESULTS: A total of 306 blood samples were collected, 84.9% (259/306) from which 
pfhrp2 PCR amplification products (gene exon2) were obtained, while the remaining
47 samples were false amplification. The length of the 250 DNA sequences ranged
from 345 - 927Â bp, with 151 haplotypes, with PI and He values of 0.169 and 0.983,
respectively. The length of the PfHRP2 peptide chain translated from 250 DNA
sequences ranged from 115 to 309 aa. All peptide chains had more than an amino
acid codon deletion. All 250 PfHRP2 strands ended with a type 12 amino acid
repeat, 98.0% (245/250) started with a type 1 repetition and 2.0% (5/250) with a 
type 2 repetition. The detection rate for type 2 duplicates was 100% (250/250).
Prediction of RDT sensitivity of PfHRP2 peptide chains based on type 2 and type 7
repeats showed that 9.60% (24/250), 50.0% (125/250), 13.20% (33/250) and 27.20.5%
(68/250) of the 250 peptide chains were very sensitive, sensitive, borderline and
non-sensitive, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The diversified polymorphism of the pfhrp2 gene deletion from
different infection sources in the Yunnan province are extremely complex. The
cause of the failure of pfhrp2 exon2 amplification is still to be investigated.
The results of this study appeal to Yunnan Province for a timely evaluation of
the effectiveness and applicability of RDTs in the diagnosis of malaria.
