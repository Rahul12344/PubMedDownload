Anopheles (Cellia) stephensi Liston 1901 is known as an Asian malaria vector.
Three biological forms, namely "mysorensis", "intermediate", and "type" have been
earlier reported in this species. Nevertheless, the present morphological and
molecular information is insufficient to diagnose these forms. During this
investigation, An. stephensi biological forms were morphologically identified and
sequenced for odorant-binding protein 1 (Obp1) gene. Also, intron I sequences
were used to construct phylogenetic trees. Despite nucleotide sequence variation 
in exon of AsteObp1, nearly 100% identity was observed at the amino acid level
among the three biological forms. In order to overcome difficulties in using egg 
morphology characters, intron I sequences of An. stephensi Obp1 opens new
molecular way to the identification of the main Asian malaria vector biological
forms. However, multidisciplinary studies are needed to establish the taxonomic
status of An. stephensi.
