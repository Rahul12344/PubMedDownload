BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum SURFIN4.1 is a putative ligand expressed on the
merozoite and likely on the infected red blood cell, whose gene was suggested to 
be under directional selection in the eastern Kenyan population, but under
balancing selection in the Thai population. To understand this difference, surf
4.1 sequences of western Kenyan P. falciparum isolates were analysed. Frameshift 
mutations and copy number variation (CNV) were also examined for the parasites
from western Kenya and Thailand.
RESULTS: Positively significant departures from neutral expectations were
detected on the surf 4.1 region encoding C-terminus of the variable region 2
(Var2) by 3 population-based tests in the western Kenyan population as similar in
the Thai population, which was not covered by the previous analysis for eastern
Kenyan population. Significant excess of non-synonymous substitutions per
nonsynonymous site over synonymous substitutions per synonymous site was also
detected in the Var2 region. Negatively significant departures from neutral
expectations was detected on the region encoding Var1 C-terminus consistent to
the previous observation in the eastern Kenyan population. Parasites possessing a
frameshift mutation resulting a product without intracellular Trp-rich (WR)
domains were 22/23 in western Kenya and 22/36 in Thailand. More than one copy of 
surf 4.1 gene was detected in western Kenya (4/24), but no CNV was found in
Thailand (0/36).
CONCLUSIONS: The authors infer that the high polymorphism of SURFIN4.1 Var2
C-terminus in both Kenyan and Thai populations were shaped-up by diversifying
selection and maintained by balancing selection. These phenomena were most likely
driven by immunological pressure. Whereas the SURFIN4.1 Var1 C-terminus is
suggested to be under directional selection consistent to the previous report for
the eastern Kenyan population. Most western Kenyan isolates possess a frameshift 
mutation that would limit the expression of SURFIN4.1 on the merozoite, but only 
60% of Thai isolates possess this frameshift, which would affect the level and
type of the selection pressure against this protein as seen in the two
extremities of Tajima's D values for Var1 C-terminus between Kenyan and Thai
populations. CNV observed in Kenyan isolates may be a consequence of this
frameshift mutation to increase benefits on the merozoite surface.
