BACKGROUND: Knowing the extent and spread of insecticide resistance in malaria
vectors is vital to successfully manage insecticide resistance in Africa. This
information in the main malaria vector, Anopheles funestus sensu stricto, is
completely lacking in the most populous country in Africa, Nigeria. This study
reports the insecticide susceptibility status and the molecular basis of
resistance of An. funestus as well as its involvement in malaria transmission in 
Akaka-Remo, a farm settlement village in southwest Nigeria.
RESULTS: Plasmodium infection analysis using TaqMan protocol coupled with a
nested PCR revealed an infection rate of 8% in An. funestus s.s. from Akaka-Remo.
WHO susceptibility tests showed this species has developed multiple resistance to
insecticides in the study area. Anopheles funestus s.s. population in Akaka-Remo 
is highly resistant to organochlorines: dieldrin (8%) and DDT (10%). Resistance
was also observed against pyrethroids: permethrin (68%) and deltamethrin (87%),
and the carbamate bendiocarb (84%). Mortality rate with DDT slightly increased
(from 10 to 30%, n = 45) after PBO pre-exposure indicating that cytochrome P450s 
play little role in DDT resistance while high mortalities were recorded after PBO
pre-exposure with permethrin (from 68 to 100%, n = 70) and dieldrin (from 8 to
100%, n = 48) suggesting the implication of P450s in the observed permethrin and 
dieldrin resistance. High frequencies of resistant allele, 119F in F0 (77%) and
F1 (80% in resistant and 72% in susceptible) populations with an odd ratio of
1.56 (P = 0.1859) show that L119F-GSTe2 mutation is almost fixed in the
population. Genotyping of the A296S-RDL mutation in both F0 and F1 samples shows 
an association with dieldrin resistance with an odd ratio of 81 (P < 0.0001)
(allelic frequency (R) = 76% for F0; for F1, 90 and 10% were observed in
resistant and susceptible populations, respectively) as this mutation is not yet 
fixed in the population.
CONCLUSION: The study reports multiple insecticide resistance in An. funestus
from Akaka Remo. It is, therefore, necessary to pay more attention to this major 
malaria vector for effective malaria control in Nigeria.
