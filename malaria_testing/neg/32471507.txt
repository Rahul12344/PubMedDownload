BACKGROUND: The multicopy var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum is of crucial 
importance for pathogenesis and antigenic variation. So far only var2csa, the var
gene responsible for placental malaria, was found to be highly conserved among
all P. falciparum strains. Here, a new conserved 3D7 var gene (PF3D7_0617400) is 
identified in several field isolates.
METHODS: DNA sequencing, transcriptional analysis, Cluster of Differentiation
(CD) 36-receptor binding, indirect immunofluorescence with
PF3D7_0617400-antibodies and quantification of surface reactivity against
semi-immune sera were used to characterize an NF54 clone and a Gabonese field
isolate clone (MOA C3) transcribing the gene. A population of 714 whole genome
sequenced parasites was analysed to characterize the conservation of the locus in
African and Asian isolates. The genetic diversity of two var2csa fragments was
compared with the genetic diversity of 57 microsatellites fragments in field
isolates.
RESULTS: PFGA01_060022400 was identified in a Gabonese parasite isolate (MOA)
from a chronic infection and found to be 99% identical with PF3D7_0617400 of the 
3D7 genome strain. Transcriptional analysis and immunofluorescence showed
expression of the gene in an NF54 and a MOA clone but CD36 binding assays and
surface reactivity to semi-immune sera differed markedly in the two clones.
Long-read Pacific bioscience whole genome sequencing showed that PFGA01_060022400
is located in the internal cluster of chromosome 6. The full length
PFGA01_060022400 was detected in 36 of 714 P. falciparum isolates and 500 bp
fragments were identified in more than 100 isolates. var2csa was in parts highly 
conserved (He = 0) but in other parts as variable (He = 0.86) as the 57
microsatellites markers (He = 0.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Individual var gene sequences exhibit conservation in the global
parasite population suggesting that purifying selection may limit overall genetic
diversity of some var genes. Notably, field and laboratory isolates expressing
the same var gene exhibit markedly different phenotypes.
