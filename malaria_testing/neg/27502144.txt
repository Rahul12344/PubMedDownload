BACKGROUND: Transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV) is a promising strategy for
interrupting the malaria transmission cycle. Current TBV candidates include both 
pre- and post-fertilization antigens expressed during sexual development of the
malaria parasites.
METHODS: We tested whether a TBV design combining two sexual-stage antigens has
better transmission-blocking activity. Using the rodent malaria model Plasmodium 
yoelii, we pursued a DNA vaccination strategy with genes encoding the gametocyte 
antigen Pys48/45 and the major ookinete surface protein Pys25.
RESULTS: Immunization of mice with DNA constructs expression either Pys48/45 or
Pys25 elicited strong antibody responses, which specifically recognized a ~45 and
~25Â kDa protein from gametocyte and ookinete lysates, respectively. Immune sera
from mice immunized with DNA constructs expressing Pys48/45 and Pys25
individually and in combination displayed evident transmission-blocking activity 
in in vitro ookinete culture and direct mosquito feeding experiments. With both
assays, the Pys25 sera had higher transmission-blocking activity than the
Pys48/45 sera. Intriguingly, compared with the immunization with the individual
DNA vaccines, immunization with both DNA constructs produced lower antibody
responses against individual antigens. The resultant immune sera from the
composite vaccination had significantly lower transmission-blocking activity than
those from Pys25 DNA immunization group, albeit the activity was substantially
higher than that from the Pys48 DNA vaccination group.
CONCLUSIONS: This result suggested that vaccination with the two DNA constructs
did not achieve a synergistic effect, but rather caused interference in inducing 
antigen-specific antibody responses. This result has important implications for
future design of composite vaccines targeting different sexual antigens.
