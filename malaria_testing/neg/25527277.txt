BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis caused by the intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii 
(T. gondii) is a global epidemic parasitic disease. DNA vaccines play an
important role in preventing the spread of toxoplasmosis. SAG family genes
encoding particular surface proteins of T. gondii are the best candidates of DNA 
vaccine. As a member of SAG family genes, SAG5 gene has been proved to have
better antigenic than SAG1. In addition, alpha-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) was 
used to be an adjuvant in malaria vaccine and received positive results. In this 
study, the effect of the DNA vaccine enhanced by α-GalCer was evaluated by
immunizing BALB/c mice.
METHODS: In the present study, SAG5D gene of T. gondii was cloned, sequenced, and
biologically characterized. BALB/c mice were randomly divided into five groups,
including three experimental groups (pEGFP-C1-SAG5D, α-GalCer and
α-GalCer/pEGFP-C1-SAG5D) and two control groups (PBS and pEGFP-C1), and were
immunized intramuscularly three times. The levels of IgG antibodies and cytokine 
productions in mouse sera were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISA). Two weeks after the last immunization, all mice were challenged
intraperitoneally with 1 × 10(4) tachyzoites of T. gondii and the survival time
of mice was recorded.
RESULTS: A significant level of increase of IgG response against the soluble
tachyzoite antigens (STAg) was detected by ELISA in experimental group. It
revealed relatively high level of IFN-γ production by the spleen cells. There
were higher productions of interleukin-4 (IL-4) in α-GalCer treated groups
compared to control groups. Challenge experiment showed a longer survival period 
(11 days compared with 5 days in control) in SAG5D DNA vaccinated mice was found 
after a lethal challenge with T. gondii RH strain.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that T. gondii SAG5D was a novel and
positive DNA vaccine candidate against toxoplasmosis. In addition, the adjuvant
(α-GalCer) enhanced the body's cellular immune response and prolonged the
survival time of mice after challenge.
