BACKGROUND: Mutations in Pfkelch13 and Pfplasmepsin2/3 gene amplification are
well-established markers for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance in Plasmodium
falciparum, a widespread problem in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The
Plasmodium vivax parasite population has experienced varying drug pressure
dependent on local drug policies. We investigated the correlation between drug
pressure from artemisinins and piperaquine and mutations in the P. vivax
orthologous genes Pvkelch12 and Pvplasmepsin4 (Pvpm4), as candidate resistance
markers.
METHODS: Blood samples from 734 P. vivax patients were obtained from Thailand
(n = 399), Lao PDR (n = 296) and Cambodia (n = 39) between 2007 and 2017.
Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4 was amplified and sequenced to assess gene mutations. To
assess PvPM4 gene amplification, a Taqman® Real-Time PCR method was developed and
validated. Selection of non-synonymous mutations was assessed by its ratio with
synonymous mutations (Ka/Ks ratios). Mutation rates were compared to the
estimated local drug pressure.
RESULTS: Polymorphisms in Pvkelch12 were rare. Pvkelch12 mutations V552I, K151Q
and M124I were observed in 1.0% (7/734) of P. vivax samples. V552I was the most
common mutation with a frequency of 0.7% (5/734), most of which (4/5) observed in
Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. Polymorphisms in Pvpm4 were more common, with a
frequency of 40.3% (123/305) in 305 samples from Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia, 
but this was not related to the estimated piperaquine drug pressure in these
areas (Pearson's χ2 test, p = 0.50). Pvpm4 mutation V165I was most frequent in
Tak, Thailand (40.2%, 43/107) followed by Pailin, Cambodia (43.5%, 37/85),
Champasak, Lao PDR (40.4%, 23/57) and Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand (35.7%, 20/56). 
Pvpm4 amplification was not observed in 141 samples from Thailand and Cambodia.
For both Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4, in all areas and at all time points, the Ka/Ks
values were < 1, suggesting no purifying selection.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel real-time PCR-based method to assess P. vivax Pvpm4 gene
amplification was developed. Drug pressure with artemisinins and piperaquine in
the GMS was not clearly related to signatures of selection for mutations in the
P. vivax orthologous resistance genes Pvkelch12 and Pvpm4 in areas under
investigation. Current resistance of P. vivax to these drugs is unlikely and
additional observations including analysis of associated clinical data from these
regions could further clarify current findings.
