Many members of the Apicomplexa contain a remnant chloroplast, known as an
apicoplast. The apicoplast encodes numerous genes, and loss of the organelle is
lethal. Here, we present a summary of what is known about apicoplast
transcription. Unlike plant chloroplasts, there is a single RNA polymerase, and
initial transcription is polycistronic. RNA is then cleaved into tRNA, mRNA and
rRNA molecules. Significant levels of antisense transcription have been reported,
together with a single case of RNA editing. Polycistronic transcription is also
observed in the related algae Chromera and Vitrella, which retain a
photosynthetic chloroplast. Surprisingly, a polyU tail is added to Chromera and
Vitrella transcripts which encode proteins involved in photosynthesis. No such
tail is added to Plasmodium transcripts. Transcription in the Apicomplexa is
remarkably similar to that seen in the chloroplast of the related peridinin
dinoflagellate algae, reflecting the common evolutionary origins of the
organelle.
