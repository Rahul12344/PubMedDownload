Identification and genetic validation of new targets from available genome
sequences are critical steps toward the development of new potent and selective
antimalarials. However, no methods are currently available for large-scale
functional analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Here we present evidence
for successful use of morpholino oligomers (MO) to mediate degradation of target 
mRNAs or to inhibit RNA splicing or translation of several genes of P. falciparum
involved in chloroquine transport, apicoplast biogenesis, and phospholipid
biosynthesis. Consistent with their role in the parasite life cycle,
down-regulation of these essential genes resulted in inhibition of parasite
development. We show that a MO conjugate that targets the chloroquine-resistant
transporter PfCRT is effective against chloroquine-sensitive and -resistant
parasites, causes enlarged digestive vacuoles, and renders chloroquine-resistant 
strains more sensitive to chloroquine. Similarly, we show that a MO conjugate
that targets the PfDXR involved in apicoplast biogenesis inhibits parasite growth
and that this defect can be rescued by addition of isopentenyl pyrophosphate.
MO-based gene regulation is a viable alternative approach to functional analysis 
of the P. falciparum genome.
