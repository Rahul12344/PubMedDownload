BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in the China-Myanmar border 
region. The genetic structure of malaria parasite may affect its transmission
model and control strategies. The present study was to analyse genetic diversity 
of Plasmodium falciparum by merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 (MSP1 and MSP2)
and to determine the multiplicity of infection in clinical isolates in the
China-Myanmar border region.
METHODS: Venous blood samples (172) and filter paper blood spots (70) of P.
falciparum isolates were collected from the patients of the China-Myanmar border 
region from 2006 to 2011. The genomic DNA was extracted, and the msp1 and msp2
genes were genotyped by nested PCR using allele-specific primers for P.
falciparum.
RESULTS: A total of 215 P. falciparum clinical isolates were genotyped at the
msp1 (201) and msp2 (204), respectively. For the msp1 gene, MAD20 family was
dominant (53.49%), followed by the K1 family (44.65%), and the RO33 family
(12.56%). For the msp2 gene, the most frequent allele was the FC27 family
(80.93%), followed by the 3D7 family (75.81%). The total multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of msp1 and msp2 was 1.76 and 2.21, with a prevalence of 64.19%
and 72.09%, respectively. A significant positive correlation between the MOI and 
parasite density was found in the msp1 gene of P. falciparum. Sequence analysis
revealed 38 different alleles of msp1 (14 K1, 23 MAD20, and 1 RO33) and 52
different alleles of msp2 (37 3D7 and 15 FC27).
CONCLUSION: The present study showed the genetic polymorphisms with diverse
allele types of msp1 and msp2 as well as the high MOI of P. falciparum clinical
isolates in the China-Myanmar border region.
