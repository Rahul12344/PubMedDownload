This study aimed to develop a multiplex-touchdown PCR method to simultaneously
detect 3 species of protozoan parasites, i.e., Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia
lamblia, and Cyclospora cayetanensis, the major causes of traveler's diarrhea and
are resistant to standard antimicrobial treatments. The target genes included the
Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein for C. parvum, Glutamate dehydrogenase for G.
lamblia, and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) for C. cayetanensis. The sizes of the
amplified fragments were 555, 188, and 400 bps, respectively. The
multiplex-touchdown PCR protocol using a primer mixture simultaneously detected
protozoa in human stools, and the amplified gene was detected in >1×103 oocysts
for C. parvum, >1×104 cysts for G. lamblia, and >1 copy of the 18S rRNA gene for 
C. cayetanensis. Taken together, our protocol convincingly demonstrated the
ability to simultaneously detect C. parvum, G. lamblia, and C. cayetanenesis in
stool samples.
