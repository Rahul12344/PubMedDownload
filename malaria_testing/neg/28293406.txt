BACKGROUND: Haemoglobinopathies constitute the commonest recessive monogenic
disorders worldwide, and the treatment of affected individuals presents a
substantial global disease burden. β-thalassaemia is characterised by the reduced
synthesis (β+) or absence (βo) of the β-globin chains in the HbA molecule,
resulting in accumulation of excess unbound α-globin chains that precipitate in
erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and in the mature erythrocytes, leading
to ineffective erythropoiesis and peripheral haemolysis. Approximately 1.5% of
the global population are heterozygotes (carriers) of the β-thalassemias; there
is a high incidence in populations from the Mediterranean basin, throughout the
Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Melanesia to the
Pacific Islands.
AIM: The principal aim of this paper is to review, from a historical standpoint, 
our knowledge about an ancient disease, the β-thalassemias, and in particular,
when, how and in what way β-thalassemia spread worldwide to reach such high
incidences in certain populations.
RESULTS: Mutations involving the β-globin gene are the most common cause of
genetic disorders in humans. To date, more than 350 β-thalassaemia mutations have
been reported. Considering the current distribution of β- thalassemia, the wide
diversity of mutations and the small number of specific mutations in individual
populations, it seems unlikely that β-thalassemia originated in a single place
and time.
CONCLUSIONS: Various processes are known to determine the frequency of genetic
disease in human populations. However, it is almost impossible to decide to what 
extent each process is responsible for the presence of a particular genetic
disease. The wide spectrum of β-thalassemia mutations could well be explained by 
looking at their geographical distribution, the history of malaria, wars,
invasions, mass migrations, consanguinity, and settlements. An analysis of the
distribution of the molecular spectrum of haemoglobinopathies allows for the
development and improvement of diagnostic tests and management of these
disorders.
