BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance threatens effective vector control, especially
for mosquitoes and malaria. To manage resistance, recommended insecticide use
strategies include mixtures, sequences and rotations. New insecticides are being 
developed and there is an opportunity to develop use strategies that limit the
evolution of further resistance in the short term. A 2013 review of modelling and
empirical studies of resistance points to the advantages of mixtures. However,
there is limited recent, accessible modelling work addressing the evolution of
resistance under different operational strategies. There is an opportunity to
improve the level of mechanistic understanding within the operational community
of how insecticide resistance can be expected to evolve in response to different 
strategies. This paper provides a concise, accessible description of a flexible
model of the evolution of insecticide resistance. The model is used to develop a 
mechanistic picture of the evolution of insecticide resistance and how it is
likely to respond to potential insecticide use strategies. The aim is to reach an
audience unlikely to read a more detailed modelling paper. The model itself, as
described here, represents two independent genes coding for resistance to two
insecticides. This allows the representation of the use of insecticides in
isolation, sequence and mixtures.
RESULTS: The model is used to demonstrate the evolution of resistance under
different scenarios and how this fits with intuitive reasoning about selection
pressure. Using an insecticide in a mixture, relative to alone, always prompts
slower evolution of resistance to that insecticide. However, when resistance to
both insecticides is considered, resistance thresholds may be reached later for a
sequence relative to a mixture. Increasing the ability of insecticides to kill
susceptible mosquitoes (effectiveness), has the most influence on favouring a
mixture over a sequence because one highly effective insecticide provides more
protection to another in a mixture.
CONCLUSIONS: The model offers an accessible description of the process of
insecticide resistance evolution and how it is likely to respond to insecticide
use. A simple online user-interface allowing further exploration is also
provided. These tools can contribute to an improved discussion about operational 
decisions in insecticide resistance management.
