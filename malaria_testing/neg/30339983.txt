At the end of 2016, Kyrgyz Republic was certified by the World Health
Organization as a malaria-free country, while only a decade ago this disease
posed a serious health threat. The progress achieved by Kyrgyz Republic provides 
a unique example of tertian (Plasmodium vivax) malaria elimination. This success 
was based on an integrated approach, including measures for the treatment of
infected people and disease prevention, vector control and the development of an 
effective national epidemiological surveillance system. Lower P. vivax msp-1,
msp-3α, csp and dbpII genes polymorphism was revealed in Kyrgyz Republic in
compare with that in Tajikistan. Molecular characterization of the causative
agent found that P. vivax populations in Kyrgyz Republic was comprised by several
lineages, highly divergent in the south-western and genetically homogeneous in
the northern regions of Kyrgyz Republic, d. Such profile in the northern regions 
was compatible with several recent introductions rather than a long-term endemic 
circulation of the parasite. A low level of genetic variability suggested that
the parasitic systems of tertian malaria, were not adapted, which, along with
other factors, largely determined the possibility of malaria elimination in
northern Kyrgyz Republic. Other determinants included environmental, social, and 
epidemiological factors that limited the spread of malaria. South-western Kyrgyz 
Republic, a region with a high level of interstate migration, requires
considerable attention to prevent the spread of malaria.
