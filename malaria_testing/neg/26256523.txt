INTRODUCTION: The complexity of immunity to malaria is well known, and clear
correlates of protection against malaria have not been established. A better
understanding of immune markers induced by candidate malaria vaccines would
greatly enhance vaccine development, immunogenicity monitoring and estimation of 
vaccine efficacy in the field. We have previously reported complete or partial
efficacy against experimental sporozoite challenge by several vaccine regimens in
healthy malaria-naïve subjects in Oxford. These include a prime-boost regimen
with RTS,S/AS02A and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing the CSP
antigen, and a DNA-prime, MVA-boost regimen expressing the ME TRAP antigens.
Using samples from these trials we performed transcriptional profiling, allowing 
a global assessment of responses to vaccination.
METHODS: We used Human RefSeq8 Bead Chips from Illumina to examine gene
expression using PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) from 16 human
volunteers. To focus on antigen-specific changes, comparisons were made between
PBMC stimulated with CSP or TRAP peptide pools and unstimulated PBMC post
vaccination. We then correlated gene expression with protection against malaria
in a human Plasmodium falciparum malaria challenge model.
RESULTS: Differentially expressed genes induced by both vaccine regimens were
predominantly in the IFN-γ pathway. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed
antigen-specific effects on genes associated with IFN induction and proteasome
modules after vaccination. Genes associated with IFN induction and antigen
presentation modules were positively enriched in subjects with complete
protection from malaria challenge, while genes associated with haemopoietic stem 
cells, regulatory monocytes and the myeloid lineage modules were negatively
enriched in protected subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: These results represent novel insights into the immune repertoires
involved in malaria vaccination.
