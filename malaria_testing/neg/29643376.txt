Host immunity exerts strong selective pressure on pathogens. Population-level
genetic analysis can identify signatures of this selection, but these signatures 
reflect the net selective effect of all hosts and vectors in a population. In
contrast, analysis of pathogen diversity within hosts provides information on
individual, host-specific selection pressures. Here, we combine these
complementary approaches in an analysis of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
falciparum using haplotype sequences from thousands of natural infections in
sub-Saharan Africa. We find that parasite genotypes show preferential clustering 
within multi-strain infections in young children, and identify individual amino
acid positions that may contribute to strain-specific immunity. Our results
demonstrate that natural host defenses to P. falciparum act in an allele-specific
manner to block specific parasite haplotypes from establishing blood-stage
infections. This selection partially explains the extreme amino acid diversity of
many parasite antigens and suggests that vaccines targeting such proteins should 
account for allele-specific immunity.
