BACKGROUND: Apicomplexan parasites of the genus Babesia, Theileria and Plasmodium
are very closely related organisms. Interestingly, their mitochondrial (mt)
genomes are highly divergent. Among Babesia, Babesia orientalis is a new species 
recently identified and specifically epidemic to the southern part of China,
causing severe disease to water buffalo. However, no information on the mt genome
of B. orientalis was available.
METHODS: Four pairs of primers were designed based on the full genome sequence of
B. orientalis (unpublished data) and by aligning reported mt genomes of B. bovis,
B. bigemina, and T. parva. The entire mt genome was amplified by four sets of
PCR. The obtained mt genome was annotated by aligning with published apicomplexan
mt genomes and Artemis software v11. Phylogenetic analysis was performed by using
cox1 and cob amino acid sequences.
RESULTS: The complete mt genome of B. orientalis (Wuhan strain) was sequenced and
characterized. The entire mt genome is 5996 bp in length with a linear form,
containing three protein-coding genes including cytochrome c oxidase I (cox1),
cytochrome b (cob) and cytochrome c oxidase III (cox3) and six rRNA large subunit
gene fragments. The gene arrangement in B. orientalis mt genome is similar to
those of B. bovis, B. gibsoni and Theileria parva, but different from those of T.
orientalis, T. equi and Plasmodium falciparum. Comparative analysis indicated
that cox1 and cob genes were more conserved than cox3. Phylogenetic analysis
based on amino acid sequences of cox1, cob and cox1 + cob, respectively, revealed
that B. orientalis fell into Babesia clade with the closest relationship to B.
bovis.
CONCLUSIONS: The availability of the entire mt genome sequences of B. orientalis 
provides valuable information for future phylogenetic, population genetics and
molecular epidemiological studies of apicomplexan parasites.
