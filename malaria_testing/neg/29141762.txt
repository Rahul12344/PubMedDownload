We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) fixed-dose 
combination to treat uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cruzeiro do
Sul, Acre State, in the Amazon region of Brazil. Between December 2015 and May
2016, we enrolled 79 patients, 5-79 years old with fever or history of fever in
the previous 48 hours and P. falciparum monoinfection confirmed by microscopy.
Attempts were made to provide direct observation or phone reminders for all six
doses of AL, and patients were followed-up for 28 days. AL was well tolerated,
with no adverse events causing treatment interruption. All but one of the 74
patients who completed the 28-day follow-up had an adequate clinical and
parasitologic response = 98.6% (95% CI: 93.2-100%). We could not amplify the one 
isolate of the case with recurrent infection to differentiate between
recrudescence and reinfection. Five (6.3%) patients demonstrated persistent
asexual parasitemia on Day 3, but none met definition for early treatment
failure. We found no mutations in selected kelch13 gene domains, known to be
associated with artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum isolates from Day 0.
These results strongly support the continued use of AL as a first-line therapy
for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Acre. Routine monitoring of in vivo
drug efficacy coupled with molecular surveillance of drug resistance markers
remains critical.
