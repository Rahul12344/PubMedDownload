A 43 kDa recombinant plasmepsin elicits immune response in mice against
Plasmodium berghei malaria.

Pirta C, Sharma NN, Banyal HS.

Intraerythrocytic parasites degrade haemoglobin to make available nutrients for
their growth and maturation. Plasmepsins, the aspartic proteases of Plasmodium
play a significant role in haemoglobin degradation and are proposed as attractive
drug targets. In the present study the gene which encodes plasmepsin in rodent
malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, was cloned and expressed. The gene was
sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21DE3 and a recombinant plasmepsin 
of molecular weight 43 kDa was obtained. The sequence obtained was analysed and
compared with plasmepsins of other Plasmodium spp. Mice immunized with the
recombinant plasmepsin induced a strong humoral immune response. ELISA and IFA
performed on the serum of immunized mice showed high antibody titres. Along with 
this, in vivo study exhibited partial protection against P. berghei infection
suggesting role of plasmepsin in malaria control.
