Reticulocyte-binding homologues (RH) are a ligand family that mediates merozoite 
invasion of erythrocytes in Plasmodium falciparum. Among the five members of this
family identified so far, only P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue-5
(PfRH5) has been found to be essential for parasite survival across strains that 
differ in virulence and route of host-cell invasion. Based on its essential role 
in invasion and early evidence of sequence conservation, PfRH5 has been
prioritized for development as a vaccine candidate. However, little is known
about the extent of genetic variability of RH5 in the field and the potential
impact of such diversity on clinical outcomes or on vaccine evasion. Samples
collected during a prospective cohort study of malaria incidence conducted in
Kalifabougou, in southwestern Mali, were used to estimate genetic diversity,
measure haplotype prevalence, and assess the within-host dynamics of PfRH5
variants over time and in relation to clinical malaria. A total of 10
nonsynonymous polymorphic sites were identified in the Pfrh5 gene, resulting in
13 haplotypes encoding unique protein variants. Four of these variants have not
been previously observed. Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte-binding homologue-5 
had low amino acid haplotype (h = 0.58) and nucleotide (π = 0.00061) diversity.
By contrast to other leading blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate antigens,
amino acid differences were not associated with changes in the risk of febrile
malaria in consecutive infections. Conserved B- and T-cell epitopes were
identified. These results support the prioritization of PfRH5 for possible
inclusion in a broadly cross-protective vaccine.
