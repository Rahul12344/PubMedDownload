Malaria afflicts over 200 million people worldwide, and its most lethal etiologic
agent, Plasmodium falciparum, is evolving to resist even the latest-generation
therapeutics. Efficient tools for genome-directed investigations of P.
falciparum-induced pathogenesis, including drug-resistance mechanisms, are
clearly required. Here we report rapid and targeted genetic engineering of this
parasite using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) that produce a double-strand break in
a user-defined locus and trigger homology-directed repair. Targeting an
integrated egfp locus, we obtained gene-deletion parasites with unprecedented
speed (2 weeks), both with and without direct selection. ZFNs engineered against 
the parasite gene pfcrt, responsible for escape under chloroquine treatment,
rapidly produced parasites that carried either an allelic replacement or a panel 
of specified point mutations. This method will enable a diverse array of
genome-editing approaches to interrogate this human pathogen.
