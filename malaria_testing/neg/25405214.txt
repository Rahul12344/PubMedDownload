About 50% of malaria infections in India are attributed to Plasmodium falciparum 
but relatively little is known about the genetic structure of the parasite
populations. The molecular genotyping of the parasite populations by merozoite
surface protein (msp1 and msp2) and glutamate-rich protein (glurp) genes
identifies the existing parasite population in the regions which help in
understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the parasite's drive for
survival. This study reveals the genetic profile of the parasite population in
selected regions across the country with varying degree of endemicity among them.
We also report the prevalence of Pfcrt mutations in this parasite population to
evaluate the pattern of drug resistance development in them.
