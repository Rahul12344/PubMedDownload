In mosquitoes, the discovery of the numerous interactions between components of
the microbiota and the host immune response opens up the attractive possibility
of the development of novel control strategies against mosquito borne diseases.
We have focused our attention to Asaia, a symbiont of several mosquito vectors
who has been proposed as one of the most potential tool for paratransgenic
applications; although being extensively characterized, its interactions with the
mosquito immune system has never been investigated. Here we report a study aimed 
at describing the interactions between Asaia and the immune system of two vectors
of malaria, Anophelesstephensi and An. gambiae. The introduction of Asaia
isolates induced the activation of the basal level of mosquito immunity and lower
the development of malaria parasite in An. stephensi. These findings confirm and 
expand the potential of Asaia in mosquito borne diseases control, not only
through paratransgenesis, but also as a natural effector for mosquito immune
priming.
