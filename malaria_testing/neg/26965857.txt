Four new norterpene cyclic peroxides (1-4), together with three known norterpene 
cyclic peroxides were isolated from the Xisha Islands Sponge Diacarnus
megaspinorhabdosa. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic
analyses and comparison with the related model compounds. The compounds (1-7)
were evaluated for the inhibitory activity against the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum, all of them showed significant antimalarial activity with 
IC50 values in the range of 1.6-8.6 μM.
