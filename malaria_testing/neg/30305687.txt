Plasmodium sporozoites deposited in the skin following a mosquito bite must
migrate and invade blood vessels to complete their development in the liver. Once
in the bloodstream, sporozoites arrest in the liver sinusoids, but the molecular 
determinants that mediate this specific homing are not yet genetically defined.
Here we investigate the involvement of the thrombospondin-related sporozoite
protein (TRSP) in this process using knockout Plasmodium berghei parasites and in
vivo bioluminescence imaging in mice. Resorting to a homing assay, trsp knockout 
sporozoites were found to arrest in the liver similar to control parasites.
Moreover, we found no defects in the establishment of infection in mice following
inoculation of trsp knockout sporozoites via intravenous and cutaneous injection 
or mosquito bite. Accordingly, mutant sporozoites were also able to successfully 
invade hepatocytes in vitro. Altogether, these results suggest TRSP may have a
redundant role in the completion of the pre-erythrocytic phase of the malaria
parasite. Nonetheless, identifying molecules with paramount roles in this phase
could aid in the search for new antigens needed for the design of a protective
vaccine against malaria.
