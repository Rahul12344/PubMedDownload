Malaria is one of the most debilitating mosquito-borne diseases with high global 
health burdens. While much of the research on malaria and mosquito-borne diseases
is focused on Africa, Southeast Asia accounts for a sizable portion of the global
burden of malaria. Moreover, about 50% of the Asian malaria incidence and deaths 
have been from India. A promising development in this context is that the
completion of genome sequence of Anopheles stephensi, a major malaria vector in
Asia, offers new opportunities for global health innovation, including the
progress in deciphering the vectorial ability of this mosquito species at a
molecular level. Moving forward, tissue-based expression profiling would be the
next obvious step in understanding gene functions of An. stephensi. We report in 
this article, to the best of our knowledge, the first in-depth study on
tissue-based transcriptomic profile of four important organs (midgut, Malpighian 
tubules, fat body, and ovary) of adult female An. stephensi mosquitoes. In all,
we identified over 20,000 transcripts corresponding to more than 12,000 gene loci
from these four tissues. We present and discuss the tissue-based expression
profiles of majority of annotated transcripts in An. stephensi genome, and the
dynamics of their alternative splicing in these tissues, in this study. The
domain-based Gene Ontology analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts
in each of the mosquito tissue indicated enrichment of transcripts with
proteolytic activity in midgut; transporter activity in Malpighian tubules; cell 
cycle, DNA replication, and repair activities in ovaries; and oxidoreductase
activities in fat body. Tissue-based study of transcript expression and gene
functions markedly enhances our understanding of this important malaria vector,
and in turn, offers rationales for further studies on vectorial ability and
identification of novel molecular targets to intercept malaria transmission.
