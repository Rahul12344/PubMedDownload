Current therapies for human parasite infections rely on a few drugs, most of
which have severe side effects, and their helpfulness is being seriously
compromised by the drug resistance problem. Globally, this is pushing discovery
research of antiparasitic drugs toward new agents endowed with new mechanisms of 
action. By using a "drug repurposing" strategy, histone deacetylase inhibitors
(HDACi), which are presently clinically approved for cancer use, are now under
investigation for various parasite infections. Because parasitic Zn2+- and
NAD+-dependent HDACs play crucial roles in the modulation of parasite gene
expression and many of them are pro-survival for several parasites under various 
conditions, they are now emerging as novel potential antiparasitic targets. This 
Perspective summarizes the state of knowledge of HDACi (both class I/II HDACi and
sirtuin inhibitors) targeted to the main human parasitic diseases
(schistosomiasis, malaria, trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis) and
provides visions into the main issues that challenge their development as
antiparasitic agents.
