BACKGROUND: Within the last century, increases in human movement and
globalization of trade have facilitated the establishment of several highly
invasive mosquito species in new geographic locations with concurrent major
environmental, economic and health consequences. The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes 
albopictus, is an extremely invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito that 
is a major public health threat throughout its expanding range.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci (on 911
individuals) and mitochondrial COI sequences to gain a better understanding of
the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific
region and to characterize its population structure. Approximate Bayesian
computation (ABC) was employed to test competing historical routes of invasion of
Ae. albopictus within the Southeast (SE) Asian/Australasian region. Our ABC
results show that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via
mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua
New Guinea or SE Asia. The analysis also supported that the recent incursion into
northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded chiefly from Indonesia. For
the first time documented in this invasive species, we provide evidence of a
recently colonized population (the Torres Strait Islands) that has undergone
rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of
genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: There appears to be high spatial genetic structure and 
high gene flow between some geographically distant populations. The species'
genetic structure in the region tends to favour a dispersal pattern driven mostly
by human movements. Importantly, this study provides a more widespread sampling
distribution of the species' native range, revealing more spatial population
structure than previously shown. Additionally, we present the most probable
invasion history of this species in the Australasian region using ABC analysis.
