Malaria control relies heavily on pyrethroid insecticides, to which
susceptibility is declining in Anopheles mosquitoes. To combat pyrethroid
resistance, application of alternative insecticides is advocated for indoor
residual spraying (IRS), and carbamates are increasingly important. Emergence of 
a very strong carbamate resistance phenotype in Anopheles gambiae from Tiassalé, 
Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, is therefore a potentially major operational
challenge, particularly because these malaria vectors now exhibit resistance to
multiple insecticide classes. We investigated the genetic basis of resistance to 
the most commonly-applied carbamate, bendiocarb, in An. gambiae from Tiassalé.
Geographically-replicated whole genome microarray experiments identified elevated
P450 enzyme expression as associated with bendiocarb resistance, most notably
genes from the CYP6 subfamily. P450s were further implicated in resistance
phenotypes by induction of significantly elevated mortality to bendiocarb by the 
synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which also enhanced the action of pyrethroids
and an organophosphate. CYP6P3 and especially CYP6M2 produced bendiocarb
resistance via transgenic expression in Drosophila in addition to pyrethroid
resistance for both genes, and DDT resistance for CYP6M2 expression. CYP6M2 can
thus cause resistance to three distinct classes of insecticide although the
biochemical mechanism for carbamates is unclear because, in contrast to CYP6P3,
recombinant CYP6M2 did not metabolise bendiocarb in vitro. Strongly bendiocarb
resistant mosquitoes also displayed elevated expression of the
acetylcholinesterase ACE-1 gene, arising at least in part from gene duplication, 
which confers a survival advantage to carriers of additional copies of resistant 
ACE-1 G119S alleles. Our results are alarming for vector-based malaria control.
Extreme carbamate resistance in Tiassalé An. gambiae results from coupling of
over-expressed target site allelic variants with heightened CYP6 P450 expression,
which also provides resistance across contrasting insecticides. Mosquito
populations displaying such a diverse basis of extreme and cross-resistance are
likely to be unresponsive to standard insecticide resistance management
practices.
