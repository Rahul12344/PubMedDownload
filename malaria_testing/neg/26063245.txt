BACKGROUND: In our previous study, a novel liver-targeting fusion interferon
(IFN-CSP) combining IFN α2b with plasmodium region I peptide was successfully
constructed. IFN-CSP has significant inhibition effects on HBV-DNA replication in
HepG2.2.15 cells. The aim of the present investigation was focused on how to
produce high levels of recombinant IFN-CSP and its in vivo anti-hepatitis B virus
(HBV) activity.
METHODS: A modified DNA fragment encoding IFN-CSP was synthesized according to
Escherichia coli (E. coli) preferred codon usage and transformed into E. coli
BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The induction conditions were systematically
examined by combining one-factor experiments with an orthogonal test
(L(9)(3)(4)). The antigenicity of the purified protein was characterized by
western blot analysis. The in vivo tissue distribution were assayed and compared 
with native IFN α2b. HBV-transgenic mice were used as in vivo model to evaluate
the anti-HBV effect of the recombinant IFN-CSP.
RESULTS: The results showed that the E. coli expression system was very efficient
to produce target protein.
CONCLUSION: Our current research demonstrates for the first time that IFN-CSP
gene can be expressed at high levels in E. coli through codon and expression
conditions optimization. The purified recombinant IFN-CSP showed liver-targeting 
potentiality and anti-HBV activity in vivo. The present study further supported
the application of IFN-CSP in liver-targeting anti-HBV medicines.
