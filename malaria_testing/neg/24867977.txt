Reduced Plasmodium falciparum sensitivity to short-course artemisinin (ART)
monotherapy manifests as a long parasite clearance half-life. We recently defined
three parasite founder populations with long half-lives in Pursat, western
Cambodia, where reduced ART sensitivity is prevalent. Using the ring-stage
survival assay, we show that these founder populations have reduced ART
sensitivity in vitro at the early ring stage of parasite development and that a
genetically admixed population contains subsets of parasites with normal or
reduced ART sensitivity.
