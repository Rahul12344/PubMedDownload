BACKGROUND: The frequency of deficient variants of glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PDd) is particularly high in areas where malaria is endemic. The
administration of antirelapse drugs, such as primaquine, has the potential to
trigger an oxidative event in G6PD-deficient individuals. According to Honduras´ 
national scheme, malaria treatment requires the administration of chloroquine and
primaquine for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum infections. The
present study aimed at investigating for the first time in Honduras the frequency
of the two most common G6PDd variants.
METHODS: This was a descriptive study utilizing 398 archival DNA samples of
patients that had been diagnosed with malaria due to P. vivax, P. falciparum, or 
both. The most common allelic variants of G6PD: G6PD A+(376G) and G6PD
A-(376G/202A) were assessed by two molecular methods (PCR-RFLP and a commercial
kit).
RESULTS: The overall frequency of G6PD deficient genotypes was 16.08%. The
frequency of the "African" genotype A- (Class III) was 11.9% (4.1% A- hemizygous 
males; 1.5% homozygous A- females; and 6.3% heterozygous A- females). A high
frequency of G6PDd alleles was observed in samples from malaria patients residing
in endemic regions of Northern Honduras. One case of Santamaria mutation
(376G/542T) was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to other studies in the Americas, as well as to data from
predictive models, the present study identified a higher-than expected frequency 
of genotype A- in Honduras. Considering that the national standard of malaria
treatment in the country includes primaquine, further research is necessary to
ascertain the risk of PQ-triggered haemolytic reactions in sectors of the
population more likely to carry G6PD mutations. Additionally, consideration
should be given to utilizing point of care technologies to detect this genetic
disorder prior administration of 8-aminoquinoline drugs, either primaquine or any
new drug available in the near future.
