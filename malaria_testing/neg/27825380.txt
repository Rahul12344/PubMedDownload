BACKGROUND: Over the past several years, thousands of microRNAs (miRNAs) have
been identified in the genomes of various insects through cloning and sequencing 
or even by computational prediction. However, the number of miRNAs identified in 
anopheline species is low and little is known about their role. The mosquito
Anopheles funestus is one of the dominant malaria vectors in Africa, which
infects and kills millions of people every year. Therefore, small RNA molecules
isolated from the four life stages (eggs, larvae, pupae and unfed adult females) 
of An. funestus were sequenced using next generation sequencing technology.
RESULTS: High throughput sequencing of four replicates in combination with
computational analysis identified 107 mature miRNA sequences expressed in the An.
funestus mosquito. These include 20 novel miRNAs without sequence identity in any
organism and eight miRNAs not previously reported in the Anopheles genus but are 
known in non-anopheles mosquitoes. Finally, the changes in the expression of
miRNAs during the mosquito development were determined and the analysis showed
that many miRNAs have stage-specific expression, and are co-transcribed and
co-regulated during development.
CONCLUSIONS: This study presents the first direct experimental evidence of miRNAs
in An. funestus and the first profiling study of miRNA associated with the
maturation in this mosquito. Overall, the results indicate that miRNAs play
important roles during the growth and development. Silencing such molecules in a 
specific life stage could decrease the vector population and therefore interrupt 
malaria transmission.
