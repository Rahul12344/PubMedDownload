BACKGROUND: Previous studies about the association between the -131R/H
polymorphism in the Fc-gamma receptor IIa (FcγRIIa) gene and malaria
susceptibility have yielded conflicting results. The aim of this meta-analysis
was to clarify more accurately the association of this polymorphism with malaria 
risk.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of the associated studies up to August 1,
2013, was conducted using the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase,
Medline, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Statistical
analyses were performed by STATA12.0 software, with odds ratios (ORs) and their
95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Six eligible studies including 4111 malaria cases and 2817 controls were
identified. A pooled analysis of these studies pointed to a significant
association between the variant H allele and reduced susceptibility to malaria or
possible protection against malaria: H vs. R (OR=0.691, POR=0.009); HH vs. RR
(OR=0.523, POR=0.013); RH vs. RR (OR=0.770, POR=0.037); RH+HH vs. RR (OR=0.664,
POR=0.019); and HH vs. RH+RR (OR=0.649, POR=0.037). In subgroup analysis, similar
significant associations were also found in Asia (HH vs. RR: OR=0.137, POR=0.009;
HH vs. RH+RR: OR=0.267, POR=0.000) and in Africa (RH vs. RR: OR=0.842, POR=0.002;
RH+HH vs. RR: OR=0.859, POR=0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis suggests that the variant H allele of the
FcγRIIa-131R/H polymorphism may be a protective factor against blood-stages of
malaria infection, both in Asians and Africans. The finding may aid the
development of effective immune protection strategies against malaria that focus 
on antibody responses and enrich current knowledge of gene polymorphism in the
malaria. Further large and well-designed studies are needed to confirm this
association.
