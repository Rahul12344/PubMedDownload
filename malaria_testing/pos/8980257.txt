Different parameters of fibrinolytic systems like t-PA, PAI, D-dimer, and
inhibitors of blood coagulation, i.e., protein C (PC), protein S(PS), and
antithrombin III (AT-III), have been studied in cases of acute malaria due to
Plasmodium falciparum and plasmodium vivax infection, and these patients were
followed up. It was observed that the plasma PAI-1 was very high in cases of P.
falciparum malaria infection as compared to normal controls and P. vivax
infection. The changes in complicated cases of P. falciparum were remarkable as
compared to uncomplicated ones. The PC, PS, and AT-III levels were also low in P.
falciparum, particularly so in complicated cases, and were normal in P. vivax
infection. The factor VIII R:Ag levels were invariably high in acute malaria. On 
follow-up of some of these cases the values came back to normal after the
antiparasite treatment. The monocyte procoagulant activity was found to be
significantly higher in P. falciparum infection as compared to that of P. vivax
infection. All these findings therefore contribute towards the production of a
hypercoagulable state in P. falciparum infection and partly explain the
complications of P. falciparum infection like cerebral malaria.
