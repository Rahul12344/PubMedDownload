C57BL/6 (B6) mice are resistant to infection with the non-lethal (NL) strain of
Plasmodium yoelii 17X, while being susceptible to that with the lethal (L)
strain. The 65 000 MW heat-shock protein (hsp 65) was strongly expressed in
splenic adherent cells of B6 mice 10 days after infection with the NL strain of
P. yoelii but only slightly in those from mice infected with the L strain. Mice
which had survived infection with the NL strain were resistant to challenge with 
the L strain and hsp 65 was strongly expressed in splenic adherent cells of these
mice. Severe combined immunodeficient mice and nude mice were susceptible to
malaria infection even with the NL strain and did not express hsp 65 after
infection, suggesting that T cells are required for the expression of hsp 65 as
well as for protective immunity. B6 mice treated intraperitoneally with
carrageenan, which impairs the macrophage function, became susceptible to NL
strain infection, indicating that macrophages play an important role as the final
effectors in protective immunity. These results demonstrate that the hsp 65
expressed by macrophages correlates closely with protection against P. yoelii
infection.
