As the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum develops inside the erythrocyte,
parasite-derived membrane structures, referred to as Maurer's clefts, play an
important role in parasite development by delivering parasite proteins to the
host cell surface, and participating in the assembly of the cytoadherence
complex, essential for the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. PfSBP1 is an
integral membrane protein of the clefts, interacting with an erythrocyte
cytosolic protein, identified here as the human Lantibiotic synthetase component 
C-like protein LANCL1. LANCL1 is specifically recruited to the surface of
Maurer's clefts in P. falciparum mature blood stages. We propose that the
interaction between PfSBP1 and LANCL1 is central for late steps of the parasite
development to prevent premature rupture of the red blood cell membrane.
