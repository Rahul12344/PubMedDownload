In a study performed in Tamale, in the Northern region of Ghana, cystatin C, a
new and sensitive indicator of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), was used to 
estimate the frequency of renal dysfunction in 78 children with uncomplicated,
Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The excretion in urine of albumin, immunoglobulin 
G and alpha1-microglobulin was also investigated. Plasma concentrations of
cystatin C were found to be elevated in 17% of the children, indicating
subclinical impairment of renal function. As most (85%) of the children had
glomerular as well as tubular patterns of proteinuria, it appears that both
glomerulonephritis and damage to tubular cells often occur in P. falciparum
malaria.
