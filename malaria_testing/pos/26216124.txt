After being delivered by the bite from an infected mosquito, Plasmodium
sporozoites enter the blood circulation and infect the liver. Previous evidence
suggests that Kupffer cells, a macrophage-like component of the liver blood
vessel lining, are traversed by sporozoites to initiate liver invasion. However, 
the molecular determinants of sporozoite-Kupffer cell interactions are unknown.
Understanding the molecular basis for this specific recognition may lead to novel
therapeutic strategies to control malaria. Using a phage display library screen, 
we identified a peptide, P39, that strongly binds to the Kupffer cell surface
and, importantly, inhibits sporozoite Kupffer cell entry. Furthermore, we
determined that P39 binds to CD68, a putative receptor for sporozoite invasion of
Kupffer cells that acts as a gateway for malaria infection of the liver.
