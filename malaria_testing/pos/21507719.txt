Plasmodium falciparum infection during pregnancy results in the sequestration of 
infected red blood cells (IRBCs) in the placenta, contributing to pregnancy
associated malaria (PAM). IRBC adherence is mediated by the binding of a variant 
Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte binding protein 1 named VAR2CSA to the low
sulfated chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) proteoglycan (CSPG) present predominantly in
the intervillous space of the placenta. IRBC binding is highly specific to the
level and distribution of 4-sulfate groups in C4S. Given the strict specificity
of IRBC-C4S interactions, it is better to use either placental CSPG or CSPGs
bearing structurally similar C4S chains in defining VAR2CSA structural
architecture that interact with C4S, evaluating VAR2CSA constructs for vaccine
development or studying structure-based inhibitors as therapeutics for PAM.
