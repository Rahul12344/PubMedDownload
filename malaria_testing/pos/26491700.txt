To examine human gene expression during uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, we
obtained three samples (acute illness, treatment, and recovery) from 10 subjects 
and utilized each subject's recovery sample as their baseline. At the time of
acute illness (day 1), subjects had upregulation of innate immune response,
cytokine, and inflammation-related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF, and IFN-γ), which was
more frequent with parasitemias >100,000 per μL and body temperatures ≥ 39°C.
Apoptosis-related genes (Fas, BAX, and TP53) were upregulated acutely and for
several days thereafter (days 1-3). In contrast, the expression of
immune-modulatory (transcription factor 7, HLV-DOA, and CD6) and apoptosis
inhibitory (c-myc, caspase 8, and Fas Ligand G) genes was downregulated initially
and returned to normal with clinical recovery (days 7-10). These results indicate
that the innate immune response, cytokine, and apoptosis pathways are upregulated
acutely in uncomplicated malaria with concomitant downregulation of
immune-modulatory and apoptosis inhibitory genes.
