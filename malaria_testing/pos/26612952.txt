The invasion of a suitable host hepatocyte by mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium
sporozoites is an essential early step in successful malaria parasite infection. 
Yet precisely how sporozoites target their host cell and facilitate productive
infection remains largely unknown. We found that the hepatocyte EphA2 receptor
was critical for establishing a permissive intracellular replication compartment,
the parasitophorous vacuole. Sporozoites productively infected hepatocytes with
high EphA2 expression, and the deletion of EphA2 protected mice from liver
infection. Lack of host EphA2 phenocopied the lack of the sporozoite proteins P52
and P36. Our data suggest that P36 engages EphA2, which is likely to be a key
step in establishing the permissive replication compartment.
