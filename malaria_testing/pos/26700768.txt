The human complement system is the frontline defense mechanism against invading
pathogens. The coexistence of humans and microbes throughout evolution has
produced ingenious molecular mechanisms by which microorganisms escape complement
attack. A common evasion strategy used by diverse pathogens is the hijacking of
soluble human complement regulators to their surfaces to afford protection from
complement activation. One such host regulator is factor H (FH), which acts as a 
negative regulator of complement to protect host tissues from aberrant complement
activation. In this report, we show that Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the
invasive form of the malaria parasites, actively recruit FH and its alternative
spliced form FH-like protein 1 when exposed to human serum. We have mapped the
binding site in FH that recognizes merozoites and identified Pf92, a member of
the six-cysteine family of Plasmodium surface proteins, as its direct interaction
partner. When bound to merozoites, FH retains cofactor activity, a key function
that allows it to downregulate the alternative pathway of complement. In P.
falciparum parasites that lack Pf92, we observed changes in the pattern of C3b
cleavage that are consistent with decreased regulation of complement activation. 
These results also show that recruitment of FH affords P. falciparum merozoites
protection from complement-mediated lysis. Our study provides new insights on
mechanisms of immune evasion of malaria parasites and highlights the important
function of surface coat proteins in the interplay between complement regulation 
and successful infection of the host.
