The influence of acute dietary protein restriction on the development of Babesia 
microti infection in the mouse model was investigated. Female mice consuming a
diet either devoid of protein or adequate with respect to protein were infected
with B. microti-parasitized erythrocytes and sacrificed 7 days later. Absence of 
dietary protein resulted in a delay in the onset of infection and a significantly
reduced peak parasitemia. Non-specific antibody responses to heterologous
erythrocytes and specific anti-babesial antibody titers were impaired in mice
consuming the protein-free diets, suggesting that the enhanced resistance to
experimental babesiosis observed in protein-malnourished mice is not an
antibody-mediated phenomenon. In addition, protein-malnourished mice did not
demonstrate significantly lower concentrations of the serum complement component,
C3, which has been implicated as a participant in the invasion process of host
erythrocytes by parasites. Serum C3 levels were significantly reduced in infected
mice consuming both diets. The mechanism by which acute protein deprivation
protects mice against lethal babesiosis remains to be determined.
