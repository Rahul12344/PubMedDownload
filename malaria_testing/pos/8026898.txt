Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity was markedly induced in the spleen of mice
infected with Plasmodium berghei, showing maximal activity at 8 days after the
infection. The increase of spleen weight, on the other hand, reached its peak
after 14 days of infection. In the blood of P. berghei-infected mice, no increase
of ODC activity was observed. This indicated that ODC was induced in the spleen
cells, but not in the parasites themselves which existed in the blood. Polyamines
(putrescine, spermadine and spermine) were also elevated in the spleen following 
induction of the ODC activity. On the other hand, increases of ODC activity and
spleen weight were observed in the spleen of mice with hemolytic anemia induced
by acetylphenylhydrazine, but the extent of these increases were smaller than
those in the spleen of mice infected with P. berghei. The present results suggest
that increases in ODC activity and polyamine levels in the spleen of P.
berghei-infected mice are related to hyperplasia of the spleen (splenomegaly)
where the formation of leukocytes and erythrocytes (hematopoiesis) was
dramatically stimulated by the infection.
