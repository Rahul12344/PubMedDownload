INTRODUCTION: Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) is associated with Epstein-Barr
virus and repeated malaria infections. A defining feature of eBL is the
translocation of the c-myc oncogene to the control of the immunoglobulin
promoter. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) has been shown to be
critical for this translocation. Malaria infection induces AID in germinal center
B cells, but whether malaria infection more broadly affects AID activation in
extrafollicular B cells is unknown.
METHODS: We either stimulated purified B cells from AID-green fluorescence
protein (GFP) reporter mice or infected AID-GFP mice with Plasmodium chabaudi,
AID fluorescence was monitored in B cell subsets by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: In vitro analysis of B cells from these mice revealed that CpG (a
Toll-like receptor 9 ligand) was a potent inducer of AID in both mature and
immature B cell subsets. Infection of AID-GFP mice with Plasmodium chabaudi
demonstrated that AID expression occurs in transitional and marginal zone B cells
during acute malaria infection. Transitional B cells were also capable of
differentiating into antibody secreting cells when stimulated in vitro with CpG
when isolated from a P. chabaudi-infected mouse.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that P. chabaudi is capable of inducing AID
expression in B cell subsets that do not participate in the germinal center
reaction, suggesting an alternative role for malaria in the etiology of eBL.
