Infection of erythrocytes with Plasmodium species induces clinical malaria.
Parasite-specific CD4(+) T cells correlate with lower parasite burdens and
severity of human malaria and are needed to control blood-stage infection in
mice. However, the characteristics of CD4(+) T cells that determine protection or
parasite persistence remain unknown. Here we show that infection of humans with
Plasmodium falciparum resulted in higher expression of the inhibitory receptor
PD-1 associated with T cell dysfunction. In vivo blockade of the PD-1 ligand
PD-L1 and the inhibitory receptor LAG-3 restored CD4(+) T cell function,
amplified the number of follicular helper T cells and germinal-center B cells and
plasmablasts, enhanced protective antibodies and rapidly cleared blood-stage
malaria in mice. Thus, chronic malaria drives specific T cell dysfunction, and
proper function can be restored by inhibitory therapies to enhance parasite
control.
