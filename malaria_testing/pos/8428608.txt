Malaria, caused by members of the genus Plasmodia, is still the most prevalent
parasitic disease in the world. In an attempt to understand genetic factors
conferring resistance to malaria, mouse models of thalassemia, sickle trait, and 
ankyrin and spectrin deficiency were studied during infection with species of
malaria infectious to rodents. Although growth of P. falciparum is not inhibited 
in thalassemic erythrocytes in culture, mice carrying a beta-thalassemia mutation
were protected from Plasmodium chabaudi adami, supporting epidemiologic findings.
Transgenic mice expressing beta s hemoglobin were also significantly protected
from two species of rodent malaria. Importantly, a significant role for the
spleen in protection in the beta s transgenic mice was found. Finally, mice
deficient in spectrin and ankyrin were studied with respect to their ability to
support the growth of malaria. It was found that spectrin deficient mice were
almost completely refractory to P. chabaudi adami and P. berghei. These models
will allow further study of host factors in resistance to malaria.
