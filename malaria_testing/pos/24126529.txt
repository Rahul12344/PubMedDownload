Cerebral malaria (CM) is associated with excessive host proinflammatory responses
and endothelial activation. The hematopoietic hormone erythropoietin (EPO)
possesses neuroprotective functions in animal models of ischemic-hypoxic,
traumatic, and inflammatory injuries. In the Plasmodium berghei ANKA model of
experimental CM (ECM), recombinant human EPO (rhEPO) has shown evident protection
against ECM. To elucidate the mechanism of EPO in this ECM model, we investigated
the effect of rhEPO on host cellular immune responses. We demonstrated that
improved survival of mice with ECM after rhEPO treatment was associated with
reduced endothelial activation and improved integrity of the blood-brain barrier.
Our results revealed that rhEPO downregulated the inflammatory responses by
directly inhibiting the levels and functions of splenic dendritic cells.
Conversely, rhEPO treatment led to significant expansion of regulatory T cells
and increased expression of the receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4
(CTLA-4). The data presented here provide evidence of the direct effect of rhEPO 
on host cellular immunity during ECM.
