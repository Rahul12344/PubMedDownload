In order to study the variation of plasma fibronectin (FN) during malaria
infection, two male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were splenectomized and
infected with Plasmodium knowlesi. As parasitaemia increased FN concentration
decreased gradually from 260 to 140 microgram/ml and 300 to 85 micrograms/ml for 
monkeys 1 and 2 respectively. The significance of this finding is discussed.
