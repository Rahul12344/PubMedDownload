Canine babesiosis is a tick-borne disease caused by the haemoprotozoan parasites 
of the genus Babesia. Early detection of systemic inflammatory response syndrome 
(SIRS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is of major importance in
clinical practice for providing information about severity and outcomes of the
disease and therapy. Plasma samples were taken at admission from five dogs with
uncomplicated babesiosis caused by B. canis canis, five dogs with babesiosis and 
SIRS, five dogs with babesiosis and MODS, and five healthy dogs. After
two-dimensional electrophoresis and capillary reversed - phase liquid
chromatography coupled online with tandem mass spectrometry, 68 differentially
expressed spots with level of significance P<0.05 were detected between groups.
SIRS in babesiosis was characterised by increases in paraoxonase 1 and apoA-I,
whereas MODS with decrease of complement inhibitors leading to prolonged
complement activation and decrease of vitamin D binding protein due to haemolysis
and activation of the coagulation cascade.
