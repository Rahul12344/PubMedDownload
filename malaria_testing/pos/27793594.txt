Type I interferon (IFN) is critical for controlling pathogen infection; however, 
its regulatory mechanisms in plasmacytoid cells (pDCs) still remain unclear.
Here, we have shown that nucleic acid sensors cGAS-, STING-, MDA5-, MAVS-, or
transcription factor IRF3-deficient mice produced high amounts of type I IFN-α
and IFN-β (IFN-α/β) in the serum and were resistant to lethal plasmodium yoelii
YM infection. Robust IFN-α/β production was abolished when gene encoding nucleic 
acid sensor TLR7, signaling adaptor MyD88, or transcription factor IRF7 was
ablated or pDCs were depleted. Further, we identified SOCS1 as a key negative
regulator to inhibit MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Finally, we
have demonstrated that pDCs, cDCs, and macrophages were required for generating
IFN-α/β-induced subsequent protective immunity. Thus, our findings have
identified a critical regulatory mechanism of type I IFN signaling in pDCs and
stage-specific function of immune cells in generating potent immunity against
lethal YM infection.
