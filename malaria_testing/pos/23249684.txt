Understanding the pathogenesis of Plasmodium vivax malaria is challenging. We
hypothesized that susceptibility to P. vivax-induced thrombocytopenia could be
associated with polymorphisms on relevant platelet membrane integrins: integrin
α2 (C807T), and integrin β3 (T1565C). Although β3 polymorphism was not related
with P. vivax malaria, α2 807T carriers, which show high levels of integrin α2β1,
had a higher probability for severe thrombocytopenia than wild-type carriers.
This evidence of the association of integrin polymorphism and P. vivax morbidity 
was further demonstrated by a moderate but significant correlation between
clinical disease and surface levels of the integrin α2β1.
