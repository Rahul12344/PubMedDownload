Reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) play a major role in the nonspecific innate 
immune response to invading microorganisms, such as Plasmodium falciparum. In a
search for genetic markers that determine differences in production of ROI, we
detected a highly polymorphic region of dinucleotide TA repeats approximately 550
bp upstream of the NADPH oxidase gp91(phox) subunit promoter. We genotyped 183
matched Gabonese children with severe or mild malaria. Repeat lengths TA(11) and 
TA(16) differed significantly in frequency between mild and severe infection,
which suggests protection against severe malaria. Both repeat lengths showed
lower levels of NADPH oxidase and promoter activities, which can be explained by 
a cyclic trend in TA repeat length with a period of approximately 5, which
indicates the necessity of correct DNA phasing between 2 possible control regions
in the promoter. We provide a molecular model of how DNA phasing generated by TA 
dinucleotide polymorphisms may influence the expression level and protect against
severe malaria.
