Theileria parva-infected lymphoblastoid cell lines of T or B cell origin were
examined for IL-2 mRNA expression. T. parva-infected T cell lines could be of the
CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8-, CD4-CD8+, or CD4+CD8+ phenotype and express alpha beta or
gamma delta TCR. By Northern blot analysis and amplification by the polymerase
chain reaction, IL-2 mRNA could be detected in all T. parva-infected cell lines
tested. IL-2 mRNA expression was also shown to be dependent on the continuous
presence of the parasite in the host cell cytoplasm, because elimination of the
parasite by treatment of T. parva-infected cell cultures with the theilericidal
drug BW720c resulted in the disappearance of detectable IL-2 mRNA. The effect of 
anti-IL-2 antibodies on the proliferation of T. parva-infected cells was also
tested. Inhibition experiments suggest that although IL-2 mRNA can be detected in
all cell lines tested, not all T. parva-infected cell lines are dependent on IL-2
for their proliferation. Our data provide the first example for the constitutive 
expression of IL-2 mRNA in T and B cells caused by infection with an
intracellular parasite.
