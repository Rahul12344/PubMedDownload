Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta1) is a pleiotropic cytokine with both
pro- and antiinflammatory properties, depending on its environment and
concentration. The present study evaluated the effects of orally-delivered
TGF-beta1 on mice parenterally-infected with various protozoan parasites. We
report that while orally-administered TGF-beta1 seems to confer partial
protection against murine chronic babesiosis and acute trypanosomosis, no
beneficial clinical effects were observed against acute babesiosis, malaria or
toxoplasmosis. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that the systemic
effects conferred by exogenous TGF-beta1 could be parasite species-specific. The 
variations in different parasitic infections could be due to (i) intrinsic
differences between parasite species and/or strains in their ability to induce
production of immunosuppressive molecules and/or (ii) differences in mechanisms
governing host protection against different parasitic infections.
