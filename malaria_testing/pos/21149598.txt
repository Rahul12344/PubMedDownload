Intravenous administration of a novel recombinant rhesus mAb against the α4β7
gut-homing integrin (mAb) into rhesus macaques just prior to and during acute SIV
infection resulted in significant decrease in plasma and gastrointestinal (GI)
tissue viral load and a marked reduction in GI tissue proviral DNA load as
compared with control SIV-infected rhesus macaques. This mAb administration was
associated with increases in peripheral blood naive and central memory CD4(+) T
cells and maintenance of a high frequency of CCR5(+)CD4(+) T cells. Additionally,
such mAb administration inhibited the mobilization of NK cells and plasmacytoid
dendritic cells characteristically seen in the control animals during acute
infection accompanied by the inhibition of the synthesis of MIP-3α by the gut
tissues. These data in concert suggest that blocking of GI trafficking CD4(+) T
cells and inhibiting the mobilization of cell lineages of the innate immune
system may be a powerful new tool to protect GI tissues and modulate acute
lentiviral infection.
