Plasmodium vivax can cause severe malaria, however its pathogenesis is poorly
understood. In contrast to P. falciparum, circulating vivax parasitemia is low,
with minimal apparent sequestration in endothelium-lined microvasculature, and
pathogenesis thought unrelated to parasite biomass. However, the relationships
between vivax disease-severity and total parasite biomass, endothelial autocrine 
activation and microvascular dysfunction are unknown. We measured circulating
parasitemia and markers of total parasite biomass (plasma parasite lactate
dehydrogenase [pLDH] and PvLDH) in adults with severe (n = 9) and non-severe
(n = 53) vivax malaria, and examined relationships with disease-severity,
endothelial activation, and microvascular function. Healthy controls and adults
with non-severe and severe falciparum malaria were enrolled for comparison.
Median peripheral parasitemia, PvLDH and pLDH were 2.4-fold, 3.7-fold and
6.9-fold higher in severe compared to non-severe vivax malaria (p = 0.02,
p = 0.02 and p = 0.015, respectively), suggesting that, as in falciparum malaria,
peripheral P. vivax parasitemia underestimates total parasite biomass,
particularly in severe disease. P. vivax schizonts were under-represented in
peripheral blood. Severe vivax malaria was associated with increased
angiopoietin-2 and impaired microvascular reactivity. Peripheral vivax
parasitemia correlated with endothelial activation (angiopoietin-2,
von-Willebrand-Factor [VWF], E-selectin), whereas markers of total vivax biomass 
correlated only with systemic inflammation (IL-6, IL-10). Activity of the
VWF-cleaving-protease, ADAMTS13, was deficient in proportion to endothelial
activation, IL-6, thrombocytopenia and vivax disease-severity, and associated
with impaired microvascular reactivity in severe disease. Impaired microvascular 
reactivity correlated with lactate in severe vivax malaria. Findings suggest that
tissue accumulation of P. vivax may occur, with the hidden biomass greatest in
severe disease and capable of mediating systemic inflammatory pathology. The lack
of association between total parasite biomass and endothelial activation is
consistent with accumulation in parts of the circulation devoid of endothelium.
Endothelial activation, associated with circulating parasites, and systemic
inflammation may contribute to pathology in vivax malaria, with microvascular
dysfunction likely contributing to impaired tissue perfusion.
