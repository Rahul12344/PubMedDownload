The successful genetic manipulation of Clostridium acetobutylicum for the
increased production of solvents will depend on an understanding of gene
structure and regulation in the bacterium. The glutamine synthetase (glnA) gene
is regulated by antisense RNA, transcribed from a downstream promoter, in the
opposite direction to the glnA gene. An open reading frame (ORF) was detected
downstream of the glnA gene, which has sequence homology to response regulators
with anti-termination activity and may be involved in sensing nitrogen
conditions. The expression of the linked beta-hbd, adh1 and fixB genes was
investigated throughout the bacterial growth cycle by RNA hybridisation
techniques. The adh1 gene was independently expressed as a 2.4-kb transcript
which peaked at 12 h, immediately prior to the solventogenic phase. The beta-hbd 
and fixB genes were transcribed throughout the acidogenic and solventogenic
phases. A regulator gene, regA, which complements a Bacillus subtilis ccpA
mutant, has been identified and sequenced from C. acetobutylicum P262. The regA
gene repressed the degradation of starch by an uncharacterised C. acetobutylicum 
gene, and may therefore play a role in the utilisation of carbohydrate substrates
in this organism.
