Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of bacterial cold-water
disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome of salmonids. The pathogen has been
reported from all regions in the world involved in salmonid aquaculture, but also
from natural fresh-water environments. We established a quantitative
loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP) method to estimate
quantities of F. psychrophilum. LAMP primers were designed based on the sequence 
of the DNA topoisomerase IV subunit B gene, parE, of F. psychrophilum. parE LAMP 
exhibited a high specificity for the parE gene of F. psychrophilum but not for
other related species. parE LAMP detected the gene in a wide range of
concentrations from 2.0 x 10(1) to 2.0 x 10(9) copies/reaction within 70 min and 
revealed a good correlation between threshold times and gene copy number.
