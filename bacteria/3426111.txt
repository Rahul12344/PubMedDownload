Whatever the product used as a food additive, ("traditional" antibiotic or
carbadox) it is likely to increase the proportion of enterobacteria resistant to 
it. This phenomenon is commonly seen with chloramphenicol, neomycin and
ampicillin, whether used as feed additives or therapeutic agents. The use of
carbadox also selects strains which are resistant to it, but this increase is
much lower than those given by the traditional antibiotics and tends to be
reversed when the drug is withdrawn. All the products select coding plasmids for 
multiple resistances. Resistance to carbadox is most often transferable to the
strains of E coli C600 and 14R525; but the Salmonella which were tested proved to
be very bad recipients of carbadox resistance.
