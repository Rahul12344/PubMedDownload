Candida glabrata is a second most common human opportunistic pathogen which
causes superficial but also life-threatening systemic candidosis. According to
the localisation of mannans and mannoproteins in the outermost layer of the cell 
wall, mannan detection could be one of the first steps in the cell recognition of
Candida cells by the host innate immune system. Mannans from the cell wall
provide important immunomodulatory activities, comprising stimulation of cytokine
production, induction of dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and T-cell immunity.
The model of DCs represents a promising tool to study immunomodulatory
interventions throughout the vaccine development. Activated DCs induce, activate 
and polarise T-cell responses by expression of distinct maturation markers and
cytokines regulating the adaptive immune responses. In addition, they are
uniquely adept at decoding the fungus-associated information and translate it in 
qualitatively different T helper responses. We find out, that C. glabrata mannan 
is able to induce proliferation of splenocytes and to increase the production of 
TNF-α and IL-4. Next, increased the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80
and CD86 and the proportion of CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD28+ T cells during in vitro
stimulation of splenocytes. Reported results provide C. glabrata mannan
capability to modulate cytokine production, DCs activation and antigen
presentation activity, influencing T-cell phenotype in response to stimulation.
