To determine the role of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) during
pneumococcal pneumonia, MCP-1 knockout and wild-type mice were infected with
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pulmonary MCP-1 levels were strongly correlated to
bacterial loads in wild-type mice. However, MCP-1 knockout and wild-type mice
were indistinguishable with respect to bacterial growth, inflammatory responses, 
and lethality.
