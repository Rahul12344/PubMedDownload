The expression of tetracycline resistance after insertion of foreign DNA
fragments between the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the plasmid cloning vector pBR
322.

Widera G, Gautier F, Lindenmaier W, Collins J.

In vitro recombination techniques were used to construct hybrid plasmids between 
pBR 322 and different DNA fragments derived from pML 21 and the E. coli
chromosome. Some of the resulting hybrid plasmids express the tetracycline
resistance gene of pBR 322, depending on the DNA fragment which has been ligated 
into the HindIII-site of pBR 322. From these studies we could conclude the
direction of transcription of the kanamycin resistance gene in plasmid pML 21
with respect to the SalI, SmaI, HincII, KpnI, EcoRI and HindIII restriction
sites. The replacement of the small HindIII-EcoRI-fragment in pBR 322 by other
DNA fragments from the E. coli chromosome and selection for tcr-phenotypes showed
that this system may be very useful for screening and analysis of
promotor-containing DNA fragments.
