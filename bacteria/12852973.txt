Twenty-five 2-phenyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,2-c]pyrazol-3-ol derivatives were
synthesized for evaluation as new inhibitors of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis.
Many of them demonstrated good inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus 
MurB, MurC and MurD enzymes in vitro and antimicrobial activity against
gram-positive bacteria including MRSA, VRE and PRSP. However, when they were
tested in the presence of 4% bovine serum albumin, the MIC values increased to
greater than 128 microg/mL against PRSP. None of the compounds demonstrated
activity against gram-negative bacteria at MIC <32 microg/mL.
