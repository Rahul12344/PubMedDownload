The performance and microbial community characteristics of a laboratory scale
anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with four compartments (C1-C4) treating sugar
refinery wastewater were investigated. The COD removal was 94.8 % with a CH4
yield of 0.21 L g(-1) CODremoved at total organic loading rate (OLR) of 5.33 kg
COD/m(-3) day(-1). Fermentative bacteria were dominant in C1 and C2, while
syntrophic acetogens and methanogens were dominant in C3 and C4. Some
acid-tolerant methanogens were enriched in acidogenic phase. The present of the
acid-tolerant methanogens could improve the efficiency and stability of the ABR
as the most of the methanogens are vulnerable to low pH. In addition, high
functional redundancy of the fermentative bacteria implicated that the microbial 
communities in acidogenic phase were stable functionally and allowed the ABR to
balance perturbation. It was also found that syntrophic acetogenesis might be a
weakness in the ABR as syntrophic acetogens were poor as compared with
fermentative bacteria and methanogens.
