Tumor marker endothelial 8 (TEM8) is a receptor for the protective antigen (PA)
component of anthrax toxin. TEM8 is upregulated on endothelial cells lining the
blood vessels within tumors, compared with normal blood vessels. A number of
studies have demonstrated a pivotal role for TEM8 in developmental and tumor
angiogenesis. We have also shown that targeting the anthrax receptors with a
mutated form of PA inhibits angiogenesis and tumor formation in vivo. Here we
describe the development and testing of a high-throughput fluorescence resonance 
energy transfer assay to identify molecules that strongly inhibit the interaction
of PA and TEM8. The assay we describe is sensitive and robust, with a Z' value of
0.8. A preliminary screen of 2310 known bioactive library compounds identified
ebselen and thimerosal as inhibitors of the TEM8-PA interaction. These molecules 
each contain a cysteine-reactive transition metal, and complementary studies
indicate that their inhibition of interaction is due to modification of a
cysteine residue in the TEM8 extracellular domain. This is the first
demonstration of a high-throughput screening assay that identifies inhibitors of 
TEM8, with potential application for antianthrax and antiangiogenic diseases.
