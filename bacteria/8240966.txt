The base compositions of DNAs from nine Microcystis strains, as determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography, were 41 to 42 mol% G+C. Chromosomal DNAs 
derived from these strains were found to be extremely resistant to many
restriction endonucleases, and a restriction analysis revealed the presence of a 
dam-like methylase or both dam- and dcm-like methylases in all of the strains
examined. Genomic Southern hybridization in which a synthetic oligonucleotide
probe (rpoD probe) was used showed that members of the genus Microcystis might
have multiple rpoD homologs, and the hybridization signal patterns observed with 
the DNAs of Microcystis aeruginosa strains were different from each other.
