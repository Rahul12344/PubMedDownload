Lactobacillus plantarum is a lactic acid bacterium that can be found during
cheese ripening. Lipolysis of milk triacylglycerols to free fatty acids during
cheese ripening has fundamental consequences on cheese flavor. In the present
study, the gene lp_1760, encoding a putative esterase or lipase, was cloned and
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the overproduced Lp_1760 protein was
biochemically characterized. Lp_1760 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty
acids from C2 to C16, with a preference for p-nitrophenyl butyrate. On
triglycerides, Lp_1760 showed higher activity on tributyrin than on triacetin.
Although optimal conditions for activity were 45°C and pH 7, Lp_1760 retains
activity under conditions commonly found during cheese making and ripening. The
Lp_1760 showed more than 50% activity at 5°C and exhibited thermal stability at
high temperatures. Enzymatic activity was strongly inhibited by sodium dodecyl
sulfate and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The Lp_1760 tributyrin esterase showed
high activity in the presence of NaCl, lactic acid, and calcium chloride. The
results suggest that Lp_1760 might be a useful tributyrin esterase to be used in 
cheese manufacturing.
