The prediction systems of chemical toxicity has been developed by means of
structure-activity relationship based on the computerized fact database (BL-DB). 
Numbers and ratio of elements, side chains, bonding, position, and
microenvironment of side chains were used as structural factors of the chemical
for the prediction. Such information was obtained from the BL-DB database by
Wiswesser line-formula chemical notation. In the present study, the
Salmonella/microsome assay was chosen as indicative of the target toxicity of
chemicals. A set of chemicals specified with mutagenicity data was retrieved, and
necessary information was extracted and transferred to the working file. Rules of
the relations between characteristics of chemical structure and the assay result 
are extracted as parameters for rules by experts on the rearranged data set.
These were analyzed statistically by the discriminant analysis and the prediction
with the rules were evaluated by the elimination method. Eight kinds of rules to 
predict Salmonella/microsome assay were constructed, and currently results of the
assay on aliphatic and heterocyclic compounds can be predicted as accurately as
+90%.
