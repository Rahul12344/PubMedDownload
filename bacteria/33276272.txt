OBJECTIVE: Human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) are involved in inflammatory
responses to bacteria by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In
search of host modulation strategies to increase LPS tolerance, Low level laser
therapy (LLLT) has been suggested as an alternative treatment that reduces
periodontal tissue inflammation. In this study, we investigate whether 810 nm
(diode) and 1064 nm (Nd:YAG) laser wavelengths, modulate pro-inflammatory
responses to LPS challenges in hGFs.
DESIGN: Primary hGFs were challenged with Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS and
irradiated with either Diode (810 nm) or with Nd:YAG (1064 nm) lasers. Cell
cultures were examined for cell proliferation by MTT assay and IL-6 and IL-8
expression by qPCR at 24, 48 and 72 h. IL-6 and IL-8 protein levels were detected
via ELISA.
RESULTS: Naïve hGF populations irradiated with both Diode 810 nm and Nd:YAG 1064 
nm lasers demonstrated cellular proliferation (p < 0.05), but LLLT did not affect
cellular viability in LPS-challenged cells. IL-6 and IL-8 gene expression levels 
revealed significant anti-inflammatory effects of irradiation with both examined 
wavelengths on hGFs challenged with P. gingivalis LPS. Protein levels of these
cytokines were increased by LPS challenge. Treatment with LLLT inhibited this
increase for both wavelengths evaluated in the study at a statistically
significant level particularly for the first 48 h.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates a modulatory effect of LLLT using
both 810 nm diode and Nd:YAG 1064 nm lasers in gingival fibroblasts by decreasing
the production of IL-6, IL-8 in response to LPS.
