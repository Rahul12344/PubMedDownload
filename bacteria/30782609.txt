Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) is a group of complex clinicopathological
entities, often associated with an aggressive clinical course. Angioimmunoblastic
T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) are the 2 most
frequent categories, accounting for >50% of PTCLs. Gene expression profiling
(GEP) defined molecular signatures for AITL and delineated biological and
prognostic subgroups within PTCL-NOS (PTCL-GATA3 and PTCL-TBX21). Genomic copy
number (CN) analysis and targeted sequencing of these molecular subgroups
revealed unique CN abnormalities (CNAs) and oncogenic pathways, indicating
distinct oncogenic evolution. PTCL-GATA3 exhibited greater genomic complexity
that was characterized by frequent loss or mutation of tumor suppressor genes
targeting the CDKN2A /B-TP53 axis and PTEN-PI3K pathways. Co-occurring
gains/amplifications of STAT3 and MYC occurred in PTCL-GATA3. Several CNAs, in
particular loss of CDKN2A, exhibited prognostic significance in PTCL-NOS as a
single entity and in the PTCL-GATA3 subgroup. The PTCL-TBX21 subgroup had fewer
CNAs, primarily targeting cytotoxic effector genes, and was enriched in mutations
of genes regulating DNA methylation. CNAs affecting metabolic processes
regulating RNA/protein degradation and T-cell receptor signaling were common in
both subgroups. AITL showed lower genomic complexity compared with other PTCL
entities, with frequent co-occurring gains of chromosome 5 (chr5) and chr21 that 
were significantly associated with IDH2 R172 mutation. CN losses were enriched in
genes regulating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in cases without IDH2 mutation. Overall,
we demonstrated that novel GEP-defined PTCL subgroups likely evolve by distinct
genetic pathways and provided biological rationale for therapies that may be
investigated in future clinical trials.
