BACKGROUND: Tumor invasion through a basement membrane is one of the earliest
steps in metastasis, and growth factors, such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)
and Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), stimulate this process in a majority of solid
tumors. Basement membrane breakdown is one of the hallmarks of invasion;
therefore, tumor cells secrete a variety of proteases to aid in this process,
including lysosomal proteases. Previous studies demonstrated that peripheral
lysosome distribution coincides with the release of lysosomal cathepsins.
METHODS: Immunofluorescence microscopy, western blot, and 2D and 3D cell culture 
techniques were performed to evaluate the effects of EGF on lysosome trafficking 
and cell motility and invasion.
RESULTS: EGF-mediated lysosome trafficking, protease secretion, and invasion is
regulated by the activity of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs). Interestingly, EGF stimulates anterograde
lysosome trafficking through a different mechanism than previously reported for
HGF, suggesting that there are redundant signaling pathways that control lysosome
positioning and trafficking in tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that EGF stimulation induces peripheral
(anterograde) lysosome trafficking, which is critical for EGF-mediated invasion
and protease release, through the activation of p38 MAPK and NHEs. Taken
together, this report demonstrates that anterograde lysosome trafficking is
necessary for EGF-mediated tumor invasion and begins to characterize the
molecular mechanisms required for EGF-stimulated lysosome trafficking.
