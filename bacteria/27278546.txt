Cerebral infarction (CI) and intracerebral hemorrhage are lethal cerebrovascular 
diseases, sometimes sharing similar clinical manifestations but with distinct
therapeutic strategies. Delayed treatment usually resulted in poor prognosis. A
timely diagnosis report is highly warranted especially in emergency. One hundred 
twenty-nine CI patients, 73 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients, and 98
controls were enrolled in this study. A direct injection mass spectrometry
metabolomics approach was adopted using dried blood spot samples. This targeted
metabolomics analysis focused on absolute quantitation of 23 amino acids, 26
carnitine/carnitine esters, and 22 calculated ratios parameters. Compared to the 
normal control group, CI and ICH showed distinct metabolite changes,
respectively. For stroke differentiation, Tyr, C5-OH/C0, Cit, Asn, Pro, Val,
Arg/Orn, Leu, and Val/Phe were elevated in the CI group. On the contrary, C5:1,
Phe/Tyr, (C0 + C2 + C3 + C16 + C18:1)/Cit, and Met/Leu were of lower levels in
the CI group. Using regression model based on some of the above-mentioned
parameters, 79.07% of stroke patients from a new set could be definitely
confirmed. This study proved the targeted metabolomics analysis was a promising
tool for rapid and timely stroke differentiation.
