Peptide loading of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules is 
central to antigen presentation, self-tolerance, and CD8(+) T-cell activation.
TAP binding protein, related (TAPBPR), a widely expressed tapasin homolog, is not
part of the classical MHC-I peptide-loading complex (PLC). Using recombinant
MHC-I molecules, we show that TAPBPR binds HLA-A*02:01 and several other MHC-I
molecules that are either peptide-free or loaded with low-affinity peptides.
Fluorescence polarization experiments establish that TAPBPR augments peptide
binding by MHC-I. The TAPBPR/MHC-I interaction is reversed by specific peptides, 
related to their affinity. Mutational and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
studies confirm the structural similarities of TAPBPR with tapasin. These results
support a role of TAPBPR in stabilizing peptide-receptive conformation(s) of
MHC-I, permitting peptide editing.
