Extraintestinal multidrug resistant Escherichia coli sequence type (ST) 131 is a 
worldwide pandemic pathogen and a major cause of urinary tract and bloodstream
infections. The role of this pandemic lineage in multidrug resistance plasmid
dissemination is still scarce. We herein performed a meta-analysis on E. coli
ST131 whole-genome sequence (WGS) databases to unravel ST131 plasmidome and
specifically to decipher CTX-M encoding plasmids-clade associations. We mined 880
ST131 WGS data and proved that CTX-M-27-encoding IncF[F1:A2:B20] (Group1)
plasmids are strictly found in clade C1, whereas CTX-M-15-encoding IncF[F2:A1:B-]
(Group2) plasmids exist only in clade C2 suggesting strong plasmid-clade
adaptations. Specific Col-like replicons (Col156, Col(MG828), and Col8282) were
also found to be clade C1-associated. BLAST-based search revealed that Group1 and
Group2 plasmids are narrow-host-range and restricted to E.coli. Among a
collection of 20 newly sequenced Israeli ST131 CTX-M-encoding plasmids
(2003-2016), Group1 and Group2 plasmids were dominant and associated with the
expected clades. We found, for the first time in ST131, a CTX-M-15-encoding
phage-like plasmid group (Group3) and followed its spread in the WGS data. This
study offers a comprehensive way to decipher plasmid-bacterium associations and
demonstrates that the CTX-M-encoding ST131 Group1 and Group2 plasmids are
clade-restricted and presumably less transmissible, potentially contributing to
ST131 clonal superiority.
