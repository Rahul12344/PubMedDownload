The fatality rate associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis remains
high despite adequate antibiotic treatment. IL-1 is an important proinflammatory 
cytokine, which is up-regulated in brain tissue after the induction of
meningitis. To determine the role of IL-1 in pneumococcal meningitis we induced
meningitis by intranasal inoculation with 8 x 10(4) CFU of S. pneumoniae and 180 
U of hyaluronidase in IL-1R type I gene-deficient (IL-1R(-/-)) mice and wild-type
mice. Meningitis resulted in elevated IL-1alpha and IL-1beta mRNA and protein
levels in the brain. The absence of an intact IL-1 signal was associated with a
higher susceptibility to develop meningitis. Furthermore, the lack of IL-1
impaired bacterial clearance, as reflected by an increased number of CFU in
cerebrospinal fluid of IL-1R(-/-) mice. The characteristic pleocytosis of
meningitis was not significantly altered in IL-1R(-/-) mice, but meningitis was
associated with lower brain levels of cytokines. The mortality was significantly 
higher and earlier in the course of the disease in IL-1R(-/-) mice. These results
demonstrate that endogenous IL-1 is required for an adequate host defense in
pneumococcal meningitis.
