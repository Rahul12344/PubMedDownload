The diabetes mellititus (type 1) condition occur when the beta cell destroy
partially due to autoimmune process. The beta cells produce insulin with respect 
to blood glucose level. The insulin hormone regulates blood glucose in body. The 
blood glucose increases in body when insulin secretion is low from pancreas,
termed as Diabetes mellititus. The Diabetes mellititus causes infection, pain in 
mouth. The regions in mouth affected by diabetes mellititius include gums, teeth,
jaw and tongue. The glucose level increases in saliva which grows harmful
bacteria. The bacteria in combination with plaque cause bad breath, gum disease
and coating on tongue. The coating and sugar level in tongue alters the
temperature of tongue. In this paper we propose to analyze tongue thermal image
to diagnose diabetes at early stage.
