Host-seeking ticks were collected in the Northern Apennines, Italy, by dragging
at 35 sites, at altitudes ranging from 680 and 1670 m above sea level (asl), from
April to November, in 2010 and 2011. Ixodes ricinus (4431 larvae, 597 nymphs and 
12 adults) and Haemaphysalis punctata (11,209 larvae, 313 nymphs, and 25 adults) 
were the most abundant species, followed by Haemaphysalis sulcata (20 larvae,
five nymphs, and 13 adults), Dermacentor marginatus (42 larvae and two adults)
and Ixodes hexagonus (one nymph). Greatest numbers of ticks were collected at
locations characterised by southern exposure and limestone substratum, at
altitudes <1400 m asl; I. ricinus was most abundant in Turkey oak (Quercus
cerris) wood, whereas H. punctata was mostly collected in hop hornbeam (Ostrya
carpinifolia) wood and on exposed rocks. Ixodes ricinus was also found up to
1670 m asl, in high stand beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood. The overall prevalence of
Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) in 294 host-seeking I. ricinus nymphs was
8.5 %. Borrelia garinii was the most frequently identified genospecies (64.0 % of
positive nymphs), followed by B. valaisiana, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B.
afzelii, and B. lusitaniae. Based upon the comparison with the results of
previous studies at the same location, these research findings suggest the recent
invasion of the study area by the tick vector and the agents of Lyme borreliosis.
