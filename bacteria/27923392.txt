Inappropriate activation of c-mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been
implicated in tumorigenesis and represented a promising therapeutic target for
developing anticancer agents. In contrast to other solid tumors, there are
limited data describing the functional role of HGF/c-MET signaling pathway in
lymphoma. In the current review, we summarize recent findings about the
expression, cellular mechanisms/functions, and therapeutic application of
HGF/c-MET in different types of lymphoma, especially B cell lymphoma, T and NK
cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma. We also discuss the existing problems and
future directions about studying the HGF/c-MET pathway in lymphoma cells.
