Streptococcus mutans SMU.1108c (KEGG database) encodes a functionally
uncharacterized protein consisting of 270 amino-acid residues. This protein is
predicted to have a haloacid dehalogenase hydrolase-like domain and is a
homologue of haloacid dehalogenase phosphatases that catalyze phosphoryl-transfer
reactions. In this work, SMU.1108c was cloned into the pET28a vector and
overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). The protein was purified to 
homogeneity and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. The 
best crystal diffracted to 2.0 Å resolution and belonged to space group C2, with 
unit-cell parameters a=77.1, b=80.2, c=47.9 Å, β=99.5°.
