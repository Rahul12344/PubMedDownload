Degradation of two chlorinated pesticides (2,4-D and DDT) using a 54-mL glass
column packed with tezontle (a low-cost basaltic scoria) was tested. Bacteria
were cultured in YPG (yeast, peptone, and glucose) liquid medium at 32 degrees C.
The rich medium was pumped during 24 h through the column to inoculate it. Later,
the wasted medium was discharged and the pesticide added. Optical densities, TOC,
and pesticide concentration were determined. Pesticide removals for 2,4-D (with
initial concentration between 100 and 500 mg/L) were about 99%. DDT removal (at
initial concentration of up to 150 mg/L) was as high as 55-99%. TOC removals for 
2,4-D was in the 36-87% interval, whereas for DDT they were as high as 36-78%.
