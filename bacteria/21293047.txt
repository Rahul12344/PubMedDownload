BACKGROUND: Patients with diabetes mellitus are more prone to bacterial sepsis,
but there are conflicting data on whether outcomes are worse in diabetics after
presentation with sepsis. Glyburide is an oral hypoglycemic agent used to treat
diabetes mellitus. This K(ATP)-channel blocker and broad-spectrum ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter inhibitor has broad-ranging effects on the immune
system, including inhibition of inflammasome assembly and would be predicted to
influence the host response to infection.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of 1160 patients with gram-negative sepsis caused by
a single pathogen (Burkholderia pseudomallei), 410 (35%) of whom were known to
have diabetes. We subsequently studied prospectively diabetics with B.
pseudomallei infection (n = 20) to compare the gene expression profile of
peripheral whole blood leukocytes in patients who were taking glyburide against
those not taking any sulfonylurea.
RESULTS: Survival was greater in diabetics than in nondiabetics (38% vs 45%,
respectively, P = .04), but the survival benefit was confined to the patient
group taking glyburide (adjusted odds ratio .47, 95% confidence interval .28-.74,
P = .005). We identified differential expression of 63 immune-related genes (P = 
.001) in patients taking glyburide, the sum effect of which we predict to be
antiinflammatory in the glyburide group.
CONCLUSIONS: We present observational evidence for a glyburide-associated benefit
during human melioidosis and correlate this with an anti-inflammatory effect of
glyburide on the immune system.
