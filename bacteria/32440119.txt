Objectives: The first objective of this study was to prepare sodium fluoride
(NaF) solution with various concentrations of polyethylene glycol-coated silver
nanoparticles (PEG-AgNPs). The second objective was to study the antibacterial
activity against Streptococcus mutans and the tooth-staining effect of the
solution.
Methods: PEG-AgNPs were prepared via the one-step chemical reduction of silver
acetate with thiolated polyethylene glycol. The PEG-AgNPs were characterized with
ultraviolet-visible spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy. The half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for the PEG-AgNPs against Streptococcus
mutans and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1) were determined. The staining
effect on dentin and enamel for the 2.5% NaF solutions with PEG-AgNPs at 12,800, 
6400, 1600, and 400 ppm was investigated using digital spectrophotometry. The
IC50 of the fluoridated silver nanoparticles against Streptococcus mutans were
measured.
Results: The PEG-AgNPs have an average diameter of 2.56±0.43 nm and showed
excellent stability at high ionic strength (2.5% NaF) for 18 months. The IC50 of 
PEG-AgNPs against Streptococcus mutans was found to be 21.16±1.08 ppm silver,
which was half of IC50 against HGF-1 cells (42.36±1.12 ppm), providing a working 
range to kill bacteria with no harm to human cells. The formulations with
different concentrations of PEG-AgNPs showed no significant staining of teeth.
Combining PEG-AgNPs with NaF significantly expanded the therapeutic window
against Streptococcus mutans by reducing its IC50.
Conclusion: A biocompatible solution of NaF with PEG-AgNPs was developed. Because
it has antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans and no tooth-staining 
effect, it can be used as an anti-caries agent.
