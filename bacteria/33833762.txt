New York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1) is a promising target
for T-cell receptor-engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapy, and targeting the human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 restricted NY-ESO-1157-165 epitope has yielded
remarkable clinical benefits in the treatment of multiple advanced malignancies. 
Herein, we report the identification of two NY-ESO-1157-165 epitope-specific
murine TCRs obtained from HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. NY-ESO-1157-165 specific
TCRs were isolated after vaccinating HLA-A2 transgenic mice with epitope
peptides. HZ6 and HZ8 TCRs could specifically bind to NY-ESO-1157-165/HLA-A2 and 
were capable of cytokine secretion with engineered Jurkat T cells and primary T
cells upon recognition with K562 target cells expressing the single-chain trimer 
(SCT) of NY-ESO-1157-165/HLA-A2. The reactivity profiles of the HZ6 and HZ8 TCRs 
were found to be distinct from one another when co-cultured with K562 target
cells carrying alanine-substituted NY-ESO-1157-165 SCTs. The binding
characterization revealed that the recognition pattern of the HZ6 TCR to
NY-ESO-1157-165/HLA-A2 was substantially different from the widely used 1G4 TCR. 
These findings would broaden the understanding of immunogenicity of the
NY-ESO-1157-165, and the two identified TCRs may serve as promising candidates
for the future development of TCR-T therapy for tumors.
