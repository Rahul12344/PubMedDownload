Routine and reproducible imaging of DNA molecules in air with the scanning force 
microscope (SFM) has been accomplished. Circular molecules of plasmid DNA were
deposited onto red mica and imaged under various relative humidities. In related 
experiments, the first images of the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase-DNA complex 
have also been obtained. This has been possible by (1) the use of specially
modified SFM tips with a consistent radius of curvature of 10 nm or less, to
minimize the amount of image distortion introduced by the finite dimensions of
commercially available tips, (2) the optimization of a method to deposit and bind
DNA molecules to the mica surface in a stable fashion, and (3) careful control of
the sample humidity, to prevent solvation of the molecules and detachment from
the surface by the scanning tip or stylus. Contact forces in the range of a few
nanonewtons are routinely possible in air and in the presence of residual
humidity. The spatial resolution of the images appears determined by the radius
of curvature of the modified styli, which can be estimated directly from the
apparent widths of the DNA molecules in the images.
