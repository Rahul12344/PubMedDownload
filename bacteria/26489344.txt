A Chlorella strain tolerant to high-strength anaerobic digestion effluent was
isolated from the anaerobic digestion effluent with a long-term exposure to air. 
The strain was identified as a Chlorella by morphological and molecular
biological methods, and named Chlorella sp. BWY-1, The anaerobic digestion
effluent used in this study was from a biogas plant with the raw materials of
swine wastewater after solid-liquid separation. The Chlorella regularis
(FACHB-729) was used as the control strain. The comparative study showed that
Chlorella sp, BWY-Ihad relatively higher growth rate, biomass accumulation
capacity and pollutants removal rate in BG11. and different concentrations of
anaerobic digestion effluent. Chlorella sp. BWY-1 had the highest growth rate and
biomass productivity (324.40 mg.L-1) in BG11, but its lipid productivity and
lipid content increased with the increase of anaerobic digestion effluent
concentration, In undiluted anaerobic digestion effluent, the lipid productivity 
and lipid content of Chlorella sp. BWY-1 were up to 44. 43% and 108. 70 mg.L-1,
respectively. Those results showed that the isolated algal strain bad some
potential applications in livestock wastewater treatment and bioenergy
production, it could be combined with a solid-liquid separation, anaerobic
fermentation and other techniques for processing livestock wastewater and
producing biodiesel.
