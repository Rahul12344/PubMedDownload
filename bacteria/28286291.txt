Inter-individual variability in the host response contributes significantly to
expression of periodontal disease. Thus, research into the human host response is
considered important in the analysis of periodontal disease. Human β-defensin-2
(hBD-2) is typically produced by epithelial tissues after stimulation with
microorganisms and inflammatory mediators, and it contributes to the initial
defense in the innate immune response. However, hBD-2 expression in response to
infection has not been investigated in human gingival tissue with periodontitis. 
We examined the response to Porphyromonas gingivalis in an established in vivo
model of human gingival grafts with various degrees of periodontitis. We also
investigated the expression profile of interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Gingival tissues
were collected from 40 patients with chronic periodontitis (21 with
slight-to-moderate disease, 19 with severe disease) during tooth extraction or
periodontal surgery. These tissues were transplanted subcutaneously into nu/nu
mice. We used real-time PCR to compare the expression of hBD-2 and IL-1β. In
slight-to-moderate chronic periodontitis, hBD-2 expression was significantly
higher in the stimulated group than in the non-stimulated group (p < 0.05), but
there was no significant increase in the group with severe chronic periodontitis.
IL-1β expression did not differ between groups. Increased expression of hBD-2 and
IL-1β was associated with slight-to-moderate periodontitis (p < 0.05), and there 
was a significant relationship between decreased hBD-2 and IL-1β expression and
severe periodontitis (p < 0.05). The initial expression profile of hBD-2 in
P. gingivalis infection differs according to the severity of periodontitis. In
addition, changes in hBD-2 and IL-1β expression may be important in the
progression of periodontitis.
