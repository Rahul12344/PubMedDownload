It is with great sadness that we have learned about the passing of Professor
David Yaffe (1929-2020, Israel). Yehi Zichro Baruch - May his memory be a
blessing. David was a man of family, science and nature. A native of Israel,
David grew up in the historic years that preceded the birth of the State of
Israel. He was a member of the group that established Kibbutz Revivim in the
Negev desert, and in 1948 participated in Israel's War of Independence. David and
Ruth eventually joined Kibbutz Givat Brenner by Rehovot, permitting David to be
both a kibbutz member and a life-long researcher at the Weizmann Institute of
Science, where David received his PhD in 1959. David returned to the Institute
after his postdoc at Stanford. Here, after several years of researching a number 
of tissues as models for studying the process of differentiation, David entered
the myogenesis field and stayed with it to his last day. With his dedication to
the field of myogenesis and his commitment to furthering the understanding of the
People and the Land of Israel throughout the international scientific community, 
David organized the first ever myogenesis meeting that took place in Shoresh,
Israel in 1975. This was followed by the 1980 myogenesis meeting at the same
place and many more outstanding meetings, all of which brought together
myogenesis, nature and scenery. Herein, through the preparation and publication
of this current manuscript, we are meeting once again at a "David Yaffe
myogenesis meeting". Some of us have been members of the Yaffe lab, some of us
have known David as his national and international colleagues in the myology
field. One of our contributors has also known (and communicates here) about David
Yaffe's earlier years as a kibbutznick in the Negev. Our collective reflections
are a tribute to Professor David Yaffe. We are fortunate that the European
Journal of Translational Myology has provided us with tremendous input and a
platform for holding this 2020 distance meeting "Farwell to Professor David Yaffe
- A Pillar of the Myogenesis Field".
