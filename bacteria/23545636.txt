The bacterial enzyme organophosphorus acid anhydrolase (OPAA) is able to catalyze
the hydrolysis of both proline dipeptides (Xaa-Pro) and several types of
organophosphate (OP) compounds. The full three-dimensional structure of the
manganese-dependent OPAA enzyme is presented for the first time. This enzyme,
which was originally isolated from the marine bacterium Alteromonas macleodii,
was prepared recombinantly in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure was
determined at 1.8 Å resolution in space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
133.8, b = 49.2, c = 97.3 Å, β = 125.0°. The enzyme forms dimers and their
existence in solution was confirmed by dynamic light scattering and
size-exclusion chromatography. The enzyme shares the pita-bread fold of its
C-terminal domain with related prolidases. The binuclear manganese centre is
located in the active site within the pita-bread domain. Moreover, an Ni(2+) ion 
from purification was localized according to anomalous signal. This study
presents the full structure of this enzyme with complete surroundings of the
active site and provides a critical analysis of its relationship to prolidases.
