A critical aspect of understanding the regulation of signal transduction is not
only to identify the protein-protein interactions that govern assembly of
signaling pathways, but also to understand how those pathways are regulated in
time and space. In this report, we have applied both gain-of-function and
loss-of-function analyses to assess the role of the non-receptor protein tyrosine
kinase FER in activation of the HGF Receptor protein tyrosine kinase MET.
Overexpression of FER led to direct phosphorylation of several signaling sites in
MET, including Tyr1349, but not the activation loop residues Tyr1234/5; in
contrast, suppression of FER by RNAi revealed that phosphorylation of both a
C-terminal signaling site (Tyr1349) and the activation loop (Tyr1234/5) were
influenced by the function of this kinase. Adaptin β, a component of the adaptor 
protein complex 2 (AP-2) that links clathrin to receptors in coated vesicles, was
recruited to MET following FER-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, we provide 
evidence to support a role of FER in maintaining plasma membrane distribution of 
MET and thereby delaying protein-tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B-mediated inactivation
of the receptor. Simultaneous up-regulation of FER and down-regulation of PTP1B
observed in ovarian carcinoma-derived cell lines would be expected to contribute 
to persistent activation of HGF-MET signaling, suggesting that targeting of both 
FER and MET may be an effective strategy for therapeutic intervention in ovarian 
cancer.
