BACKGROUND: Analyses of gut microbiome composition in livestock species have
shown its potential to contribute to the regulation of complex phenotypes.
However, little is known about the host genetic control over the gut microbial
communities. In pigs, previous studies are based on classical
"single-gene-single-trait" approaches and have evaluated the role of host genome 
controlling gut prokaryote and eukaryote communities separately.
RESULTS: In order to determine the ability of the host genome to control the
diversity and composition of microbial communities in healthy pigs, we undertook 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 39 microbial phenotypes that included 
2 diversity indexes, and the relative abundance of 31 bacterial and six commensal
protist genera in 390 pigs genotyped for 70 K SNPs. The GWAS results were
processed through a 3-step analytical pipeline comprised of (1) association
weight matrix; (2) regulatory impact factor; and (3) partial correlation and
information theory. The inferred gene regulatory network comprised 3561 genes
(within a 5 kb distance from a relevant SNP-P < 0.05) and 738,913 connections
(SNP-to-SNP co-associations). Our findings highlight the complexity and polygenic
nature of the pig gut microbial ecosystem. Prominent within the network were 5
regulators, PRDM15, STAT1, ssc-mir-371, SOX9 and RUNX2 which gathered 942, 607,
588, 284 and 273 connections, respectively. PRDM15 modulates the transcription of
upstream regulators of WNT and MAPK-ERK signaling to safeguard naive pluripotency
and regulates the production of Th1- and Th2-type immune response. The signal
transducer STAT1 has long been associated with immune processes and was recently 
identified as a potential regulator of vaccine response to porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome. The list of regulators was enriched for immune-related 
pathways, and the list of predicted targets includes candidate genes previously
reported as associated with microbiota profile in pigs, mice and human, such as
SLIT3, SLC39A8, NOS1, IL1R2, DAB1, TOX3, SPP1, THSD7B, ELF2, PIANP, A2ML1, and
IFNAR1. Moreover, we show the existence of host-genetic variants jointly
associated with the relative abundance of butyrate producer bacteria and host
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results identified regulators, candidate genes, 
and mechanisms linked with microbiome modulation by the host. They further
highlight the value of the proposed analytical pipeline to exploit pleiotropy and
the crosstalk between bacteria and protists as significant contributors to
host-microbiome interactions and identify genetic markers and candidate genes
that can be incorporated in breeding program to improve host-performance and
microbial traits. Video Abstract.
