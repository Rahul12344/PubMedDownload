BACKGROUND: Previous data has shown that severe traumatic injury is associated
with bone marrow dysfunction, which manifests as persistent injury-associated
anemia. This study sought to identify whether the expression of
erythropoiesis-related microRNAs were altered in the bone marrow of trauma
patients to determine if these microRNAs play a role in persistent
injury-associated anemia.
METHODS: Bone marrow was collected from severely injured trauma patients who
underwent fracture fixation as well as patients who underwent elective hip
replacement. There were 27 trauma patients and 10 controls analyzed. Total RNA
and microRNA were isolated from CD34-positive cells using the RNeasy Plus Mini
kit, and genome-wide microRNA expression patterns were assayed. Genes with
significant expression differences were found using BRB-ArrayTools with a
significance of P < .01.
RESULTS: There were marked differences in expression of 108 microRNAs in the
trauma group when compared with hip replacement patients. Four of these microRNAs
play a role in regulating erythropoiesis: microRNA-150, microRNA-223,
microRNA15a, and microRNA-24. These microRNAs were all upregulated significantly,
with trauma/hip replacement fold changes of 1.7, 1.8, 1.2, and 1.2 respectively, 
and all act to suppress or regulate erythropoiesis.
CONCLUSION: Assessment of the bone marrow microRNA profile in trauma patients
compared to those undergoing elective hip replacement revealed the differential
expression of microRNA-150, microRNA-223, microRNA-15a, and microRNA-24. These
microRNAs all play a role in decreased erythroid progenitor cell growth and
provide important insight to the erythropoietic dysfunction seen after trauma.
