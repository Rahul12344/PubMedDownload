Peptides extracted from HLA-A2.1 class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules expressed on the antigen processing mutant CEMx721.174.T2 were
characterized by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Only seven
dominant peptides were found, in contrast to over 200 associated with HLA-A2.1 on
normal cells. These peptides were derived from the signal peptide domains of
normal cellular proteins, were usually larger than nine residues, and were also
associated with HLA-A2.1 in normal cells. These results suggest that proteolysis 
of signal peptide domains in the endoplasmic reticulum is a second mechanism for 
processing and presentation of peptides for association with class I molecules.
