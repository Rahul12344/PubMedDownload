The aim of this study was to analyze the alarming spread of NDM-1- and
OXA-48-co-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates, collected between
October 2016 and January 2018 in a neonatal intensive care unit of the University
Hospital, Catania, Italy, through whole genome sequencing. All confirmed
carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKp) isolates were characterized pheno- and 
geno-typically, as well as by whole genome sequencing (WGS). A total of 13 CRKp
isolates were identified from 13 patients. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) was performed, and the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme used was
based on the gene sequence as published on the MLST Pasteur website. Core genome 
MLST (cgMLST) was also performed. All isolates co-carried blaoxa-48 and blaNDM-1 
genes located on different plasmids belonging to the IncM/L and IncA/C2 groups,
respectively. The 13 strains had identical PFGE profiles. MLST and cgMLST showed 
that K. pneumoniae was dominated by CRKp ST101 and two novel STs (ST3666 and
ST3367), identified after submission to the MLST database for ST assignment. All 
isolates shared the same virulence factors such as type 3 fimbriae, genes for
yersiniabactin biosynthesis, yersiniabactin receptor, and iron ABC transporter.
They carried the wzi137 variant associated with the K17 serotype. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first report of two novel STs, 3366 and 3367,
NDM-OXA-48-co-producing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates, in Italy.
