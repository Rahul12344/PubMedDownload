AIMS: The ability of Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the causative agent of rainbow
trout fry syndrome (RTFS) in fish, to attach to unfertilized rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) eggs and to hydrocarbon n-hexadecane was examined in the
present study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Five different isolates of Fl. psychrophilum obtained from a
variety of origins were compared. The effect of the age of the bacterium and
conditions of starvation on the ability of the bacterium to adhere, were also
evaluated.
CONCLUSION: The different isolates were found to exhibit a similar ability to
attach to both substrates. Increased surface hydrophobicity and a greater ability
to attach to the surface of the eggs were observed with bacteria aged for one
month, compared to bacteria cultured in Cytophaga agar for only three days.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results provide useful information
regarding the pathogenicity of RTFS, especially during the initial steps of
infection.
