This report describes 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) toxicity in a dog that resulted in
severe bone marrow suppression. The dog initially was presented with neurologic
and gastrointestinal signs and developed pancytopenia characterized by severe
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Examination of bone marrow aspirate showed
aplasia. The dog also had marked echinocytosis, which has been previously
associated with in vitro 5-FU exposure. The patient was given aggressive
supportive care and recovered within 25 d of exposure. To the authors' knowledge,
this is the first report of a case of 5-FU toxicity in a dog to include results
of bone marrow examination, as well as the first to describe echinocytosis
related to 5-FU toxicity.
