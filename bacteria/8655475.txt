Both surfaces of the hexagonally packed intermediate (HPI) layer of Deinococcus
radiodurans were imaged in buffer solution by atomic force microscopy. When
adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica, the hydrophilic outer surface of the HPI layer 
was attached to the substrate and the hydrophobic inner surface was exposed to
the stylus. The height of a single HPI layer was 7.0 nm, while overlapping edges 
of adjacent single layers adsorbed to mica had a height of 14.7 nm. However,
double-layered stacks with inner surfaces facing each other exhibited a height of
17.4 nm. These stacks exposed the outer surface to the stylus. The different
heights of overlapping layers and stacks are attributed to differences in the
interaction between inner and outer surfaces. At high resolution, the inner
surface revealed a protruding core with a central pore connected by six emanating
arms. The pores exhibited two conformations, one with and the other without a
central plug. Individual pores were observed to switch from one state to the
other.
