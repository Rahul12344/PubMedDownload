Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the commonest gastrointestinal
mesenchymal tumor, which rarely metastasizes to lymph nodes. Therefore, unlike
cases of adenocarcinoma, lymphadenectomy is seldom warranted. We describe an
unusual case of a polypoid GIST of the small bowel which metastasized to the
regional mesenteric lymph nodes at the time of primary surgery. The patient was a
79-year-old female who presented with partial bowel obstruction and anemia. The
presented case has three unusual features, as the tumor was grossly pedunculated,
microscopically pleomorphic, and featured mesenteric lymph node metastasis at the
time of diagnosis.
