Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 is the only known producer of landomycin A (LaA),
one of the largest glycosylated angucycline antibiotics possessing strong
antiproliferative properties. There is rising interest in elucidation of
mechanisms of action of landomycins, which, in turn, requires access to large
quantities of the pure compounds. Overproduction of LaA has been achieved in the 
past through manipulation of cluster-situated regulatory genes. However, other
components of the LaA biosynthetic regulatory network remain unknown. To fill
this gap, we elucidated the contribution of AdpA family pleiotropic regulators in
landomycin production via expression of adpA genes of different origins in S.
cyanogenus S136. Overexpression of the native S. cyanogenus S136 adpA ortholog
had no effect on landomycin titers. In the same time, expression of several
heterologous adpA genes led to significantly increased landomycin production
under different cultivation conditions. Hence, heterologous adpA genes are a
useful tool to enhance or activate landomycin production by S. cyanogenus. Our
ongoing research effort is focused on identification of mutations that render S. 
cyanogenus AdpA nonfunctional.
