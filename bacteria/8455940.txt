While screening a chicken kidney cDNA library for the normal homolog of the yes
oncogene, we isolated a clone that encodes a novel non-receptor type protein
tyrosine kinase of the Src family. We named this gene product Yrk (York), as an
acronym for Yes-related kinase. As predicted from the cDNA sequence, the Yrk
protein consists of 536 amino acids and has all the canonical features of a Src
kinase. At the amino terminus it contains a myristylation signal, followed by a
unique domain, SH3 and SH2 motifs, an ATP binding site, a kinase region and a
carboxy-terminal sequence with a potential regulatory tyrosine at position 530.
The sequence of the Yrk protein showed 79% identity with human Fyn and 72%
identity with chicken Yes. To eliminate the possibility that the Yrk protein is
an avian homolog of mammalian Fyn, we isolated and sequenced the chicken fyn
cDNA. The sequence data together with Southern and Northern blot analyses showed 
that the chicken yrk gene is distinct from the chicken fyn gene. Antibodies
generated against the unique domain of the yrk protein expressed in bacteria
precipitated a 60-kDa protein that was active in an immune complex kinase assay
and was phosphorylated on tyrosine. Expression of the Yrk protein in adult
chicken tissues was elevated in cerebellum and spleen. Relatively high levels of 
Yrk were also found in lung and skin.
