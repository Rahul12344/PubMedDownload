A method has been developed that has been found to give reproducible images of
uncoated polysaccharides by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Aqueous solutions of
the polysaccharide are deposited as drops onto freshly cleaved mica surfaces, air
dried, and then imaged under butanol. The method has been used to obtain images
of the bacterial polysaccharide acetan. In regions within the deposited sample,
where the molecules are aligned side-by-side, it has been possible to observe a
periodic structure along the polysaccharide chain, attributable to the helical
structure of acetan.
