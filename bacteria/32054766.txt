Biodiversity is declining at unprecedented rates worldwide. Yet cascading effects
of biodiversity loss on other taxa are largely unknown because baseline data are 
often unavailable. We document the collapse of a Neotropical snake community
after the invasive fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis caused a
chytridiomycosis epizootic leading to the catastrophic loss of amphibians, a food
source for snakes. After mass mortality of amphibians, the snake community
contained fewer species and was more homogeneous across the study site, with
several species in poorer body condition, despite no other systematic changes in 
the environment. The demise of the snake community after amphibian loss
demonstrates the repercussive and often unnoticed consequences of the
biodiversity crisis and calls attention to the invisible declines of rare and
data-deficient species.
