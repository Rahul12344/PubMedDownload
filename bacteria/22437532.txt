Human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAM-MSCs) are capable of 
differentiating into several lineages and possess immunomodulatory properties. In
this study, we investigated the soluble factor-mediated immunomodulatory effects 
of hAM-MSCs. Mitogen-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)
proliferation was suppressed by hAM-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner as well as
hAM-MSC culture supernatant. Moreover, interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17
production significantly decreased from PBMC, whereas IL-10 from PBMCs and
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) production from hAM-MSCs significantly
increased in co-cultures of hAM-MSCs and PBMCs. Production of several MSC
factors, including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), TGF-β, prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), and indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase (IDO), increased significantly in
hAM-MSCs co-cultured with PBMCs. These results indicate that the immunomodulatory
effects of hAM-MSCs may be associated with soluble factors (TGF-β, HGF, PGE2, and
IDO), suggesting that hAM-MSCs may have potential clinical use in regenerative
medicine.
