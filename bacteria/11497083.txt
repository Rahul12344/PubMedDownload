Water samples were collected at three therapeutic thermal spas in the area of
Brescia, between February and October 2000: 34.8% of the samples contained
Legionella pneumophila; the predominant isolates (30%) belonged to Legionella
pneumophila serogroup 1. The microorganism was present in the spa water at high
concentrations, generally higher than 10000 cfu/l. The large number of positive
Legionella pneumophila samples indicates a potential risk of infection to
patients, especially those undergoing inhalation treatment with thermal water, or
those using a whirlpool or taking a shower even if, during the study, no clinical
cases of Legionnaires' disease were observed. In some inhalators in use we
detected Legionella pneumophila: after a treatment to eradicate the
microorganism, no sanitary fittings currently show contamination. Thus, in our
opinion, they are not sources of infection when they are mantained and serviced
properly. Thermal disinfection and service checks at regular intervals are
suggested for contaminated systems.
