OBJECTIVE: To validate our previously developed 16 plasma-protein biomarker panel
to differentiate between transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and non-cerebrovascular
emergency department (ED) patients.
METHOD: Two consecutive cohorts of ED patients prospectively enrolled at two
urban medical centers into the second phase of SpecTRA study (training, cohort
2A, n = 575; test, cohort 2B, n = 528). Plasma samples were analyzed using liquid
chromatography/multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry. Logistic
regression models which fit cohort 2A were validated on cohort 2B.
RESULTS: Three of the panel proteins failed quality control and were removed from
the panel. During validation, panel models did not outperform a simple
motor/speech (M/S) deficit variable. Post-hoc analyses suggested the measured
behaviour of L-selectin and coagulation factor V contributed to poor model
performance. Removal of these proteins increased the external performance of a
model containing the panel and the M/S variable.
CONCLUSIONS: Univariate analyses suggest insulin-like growth factor-binding
protein 3 and serum paraoxonase/lactonase 3 are reliable and reproducible
biomarkers for TIA status. Logistic regression models indicated L-selectin,
apolipoprotein B-100, coagulation factor IX, and thrombospondin-1 to be
significant multivariate predictors of TIA. We discuss multivariate feature
subset analyses as an exploratory technique to better understand a panel's full
predictive potential.
