NUT (midline) carcinoma is a rare, highly aggressive, poorly differentiated
carcinoma that characteristically harbors a rearrangement of the NUTM1 gene. Most
of these tumors occur in adolescents and young adults, arise from the midline
structures of the thorax, head, and neck, and are associated with extremely poor 
outcomes. Rare cases originating from salivary glands have been reported with
clinicopathologic features comparable to NUT carcinoma of other sites. Outcome
studies regarding this subgroup are currently lacking. We report a case of NUT
carcinoma arising in a submandibular gland of a 12-year-old boy. Diagnosis was
confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrating fusion of the BRD4 
(19p13.12) and NUTM1 (15q14) gene loci. A systematic review of all previously
reported salivary gland NUT carcinomas (n = 15) showed exclusive occurrence of
pediatric cases (n = 6) in males compared to adult patients (n = 9, male:
female = 1:2; p < 0.05). The median survival was 24 and 4 months for pediatric
and adult patients, respectively (95% confidence interval was 8-24 and
1-7 months, respectively; p < 0.01). The 1-year overall survival was 67% for
pediatric and 11% for adult patients. Among all NUT carcinomas, pediatric
salivary gland tumors may represent a distinct clinical subset associated with
male predilection and comparatively prolonged survival.
