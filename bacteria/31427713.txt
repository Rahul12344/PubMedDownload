The caproate-producing bacterium, Megasphaera hexanoica, metabolizes fructose to 
produce C2~C8 carbon-chain carboxylic acids using various electron acceptors. In 
particular, odd-chain carboxylic acids (OCCAs) such as valerate (C5) and
heptanoate (C7), were produced at relatively high concentrations upon propionate 
supplementation. Using a statistical experimental design method, the optimal
culture medium was established for the selective production of OCCAs among the
total produced acids. In a medium containing 2.42 g L-1 sodium acetate and
18.91 g L-1 sodium propionate, M. hexanoica produced 9.48 g L-1 valerate,
2.48 g L-1 heptanoate, and 0.12 g L-1 caproate. To clarify the metabolism of the 
exogenous added propionate for OCCAs production, 13C tracer experiments were
performed by supplementing the culture broth with [1,2,3-13C3] propionate. The
metabolites analysis based on mass spectrometry showed that the propionate was
only used to produce valerate and heptanoate without being participated in other 
metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the carbon elongation pathway in M. hexanoica
was explained by the finding that the incorporation of propionate and acetate in 
the produced valerate occurred in only one orientation.
