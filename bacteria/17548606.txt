Ag-specific CD4 T cells transferred into unirradiated Ag-bearing recipients
proliferate, but survival and accumulation of proliferating cells is not
extensive and the donor cells do not acquire effector functions. We previously
showed that a single costimulatory signal delivered by an agonist Ab to OX40
(CD134) promotes accumulation of proliferating cells and promotes differentiation
to effector CD4 T cells capable of secreting IFN-gamma. In this study, we
determined whether OX40 costimulation requires supporting costimulatory or
differentiation signals to drive acquisition of effector T cell function. We
report that OX40 engagement drives effector T cell differentiation in the absence
of CD28 and CD40 signals. Two important regulators of Th1 differentiation, IL-12R
and T-bet, also are not required for acquisition of effector function in CD4 T
cells responsive to OX40 stimulation. Finally, we show that CD25-deficient CD4 T 
cells produce little IFN-gamma in the presence of OX40 costimulation compared
with wild type, suggesting that IL-2R signaling is required for efficient
OX40-mediated differentiation to IFN-gamma secretion.
