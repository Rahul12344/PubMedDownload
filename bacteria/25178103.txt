Dermatophytes initiate dermatophytosis, but susceptibility to infection is
dictated by host genetic factors, although the role of some of these-such as
human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) genomic (DEFB4) copy number (CN) variation and its 
induction by IL-22-remains unclear. This was investigated in this cross-sectional
study in 442 unrelated Caucasian subjects, including 195 healthy controls and 247
dermatophytosis patients who were divided into five subgroups according to
clinical presentation. DNA samples were evaluated for DEFB4 CN variation by
relative quantification using the comparative CT method, and serum hBD-2 and
IL-22 levels were determined by ELISA. DEFB4 CN in patients was significantly
lower and, except in the tinea cruris subgroup, serum hBD-2 levels were higher
than in controls. The positive correlation between hBD-2 levels and DEFB4 CN
observed in controls was not detected in patients, who also had higher serum
IL-22 levels that were positively correlated with hBD-2 levels. Moreover, unlike 
in control subjects, the serum IL-22 level was negatively correlated with DEFB4
CN in patients. Taken together, these findings suggest an association between
decreased DEFB4 CN, elevated serum hBD-2 and IL-22 levels, and dermatophytosis,
underscoring a gene/cytokine interaction in the occurrence of this infection.
