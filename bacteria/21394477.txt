The role of MicA (repressing small regulatory non-coding RNAs of two Salmonella
porins) was determined in virulence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.
Transcriptional analysis revealed that the expression of the micA gene is driven 
by a single σ(E)-dependent promoter, micAp. Its activity increased towards
stationary phase; in exponential phase, the activity was induced by several
stresses by a DegS-dependent mechanism. Although phenotypic analysis revealed no 
significant differences between wild-type and the micA mutant strains, in vivo
studies showed that this mutant is more virulent in the mouse model.
