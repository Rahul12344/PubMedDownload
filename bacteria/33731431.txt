Mechanisms governing allogeneic T cell responses after solid organ and allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are incompletely understood. To
identify lncRNAs that regulate human donor T cells after clinical HSCT, we
performed RNA sequencing on T cells from healthy individuals and donor T cells
from three different groups of HSCT recipients that differed in their degree of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) mismatch. We found that lncRNA
differential expression was greatest in T cells after MHC-mismatched HSCT
relative to T cells after either MHC-matched or autologous HSCT. Differential
expression was validated in an independent patient cohort and in mixed lymphocyte
reactions using ex vivo healthy human T cells. We identified Linc00402, an
uncharacterized lncRNA, among the lncRNAs differentially expressed between the
mismatched unrelated and matched unrelated donor T cells. We found that Linc00402
was conserved and exhibited an 88-fold increase in human T cells relative to all 
other samples in the FANTOM5 database. Linc00402 was also increased in donor T
cells from patients who underwent allogeneic cardiac transplantation and in
murine T cells. Linc00402 was reduced in patients who subsequently developed
acute graft-versus-host disease. Linc00402 enhanced the activity of ERK1 and
ERK2, increased FOS nuclear accumulation, and augmented expression of
interleukin-2 and Egr-1 after T cell receptor engagement. Functionally, Linc00402
augmented the T cell proliferative response to an allogeneic stimulus but not to 
a nominal ovalbumin peptide antigen or polyclonal anti-CD3/CD28 stimulus. Thus,
our studies identified Linc00402 as a regulator of allogeneic T cell function.
