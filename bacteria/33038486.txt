To assessed the Streptococcus mutans bystander-induced bioeffects following
sonodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (SACT) by Curcumin-Poly
(Lactic-co-Glycolic Acid) nanoparticles (Cur-PLGA-NPs). Cur-PLGA-NPs were
synthesized and characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Transmission
Electron Microscope (TEM), and Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform IR
(ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, as well as, determination of in vitro drug release.
Following the successful synthesis and characterization of Cur-PLGA-NPs, the cell
survival, intracellular ROS production, apoptotic effects, DNA fragmentation, and
gene expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were investigated on human
gingival fibroblast (HGF) cells as off-target cells through S. mutans
bystander-induced bioeffects following SACT (BCSS). No significant cytotoxic and 
damage caused by the release of ROS from BCSS were observed in HGF cells (P >
0.05). There was no DNA fragmentation and anti-proliferation effects on HGF
cells. The expression levels of bFGF, TNF-α, and IL-8 genes were increased after 
exposure to BCSS to 15.4-, 13.5-, and 8.7-fold, respectively (P < 0.05), while
TGF-ß and IL-10 were downregulated to -4.1- and -6.8-fold, respectively (P <
0.05). It could be concluded that there were no bystander bioeffects of targeted 
sonocatalytic stress on off-target cells.
