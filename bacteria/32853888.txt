The aim of this study was to investigate the use of radish and beetroot powders
as potential substitutes of nitrite in fermented dry sausages due to their high
nitrate content (around 16,000 and 14,000 mg/kg, respectively). Six treatments
were prepared and evaluated during the ripening process and storage time: C1
(control with 150 mg/kg sodium nitrite and 150 mg/kg sodium nitrate), C2 (control
without sodium nitrite/nitrate), R05 (0.5% radish powder), R1 (1% radish powder),
B05 (0.5% beetroot powder) and B1 (1% beetroot powder). The addition of vegetable
powders influenced moisture content, weight loss and water activity of sausages. 
Nitrite was formed from radish and beetroot powders during the ripening process, 
especially in R1 and B1 treatments. Beetroot powder affected colour, pigments and
lactic acid bacteria counts. The results of pH, colour, lipid oxidation, nitrite 
and nitrate analysis suggest R1 treatment as a potential nitrite replacer
obtained from a simple and feasible drying process.
