Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is considered as a hub protein and is a
key regulator of DNA replication, repair, cell cycle control, and apoptosis. PCNA
is overexpressed in many cancer types, and PCNA overexpression is correlated with
cancer virulence. Membrane-associated PCNA is a ligand for the NKp44 (NCR2)
innate immune receptor. The purpose of this study was to characterize the
PCNA-binding site within NKp44. We have identified NKp44-derived linear peptide
(pep8), which can specifically interact with PCNA and partly block the NKp44-PCNA
interaction. We then tested whether NKp44-derived pep8 (NKp44-pep8) fused to
cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) can be employed for targeting the intracellular 
PCNA for the purpose of anticancer therapy. Treatment of tumor cells with
NKp44-pep8, fused to R11-NLS cell-penetrating peptide (R11-NLS-pep8), reduced
cell viability and promoted cell death, in various murine and human cancer cell
lines. Administration of R11-NLS-pep8 to tumor-bearing mice suppressed tumor
growth in the 4T1 breast cancer and the B16 melanoma in vivo models. We therefore
identified the NKp44 binding site to PCNA and further developed an
NKp44-peptide-based agent that can inhibit tumor growth through interfering with 
the function of intracellular PCNA in the tumor cell.
