BACKGROUND: Atypical chemokine receptor 3 (ACKR3, synonym CXCR7) is increasingly 
considered relevant in neuroinflammatory conditions, in which its upregulation
contributes to compromised endothelial barrier function and may ultimately allow 
inflammatory brain injury. While an impact of ACKR3 has been recognized in
several neurological autoimmune diseases, neuroinflammation may also result from 
infectious agents, including Ureaplasma species (spp.). Although commonly
regarded as commensals of the adult urogenital tract, Ureaplasma spp. may cause
invasive infections in immunocompromised adults as well as in neonates and appear
to be relevant pathogens in neonatal meningitis. Nonetheless, clinical and in
vitro data on Ureaplasma-induced inflammation are scarce.
METHODS: We established a cell culture model of Ureaplasma meningitis, aiming to 
analyze ACKR3 variances as a possible pathomechanism in Ureaplasma-associated
neuroinflammation. Non-immortalized human brain microvascular endothelial cells
(HBMEC) were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis
factor-α (TNF-α), and native as well as LPS-primed HBMEC were cultured with
Ureaplasma urealyticum serovar 8 (Uu8) and U. parvum serovar 3 (Up3). ACKR3
responses were assessed via qRT-PCR, RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and
immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: LPS, TNF-α, and Ureaplasma spp. influenced ACKR3 expression in HBMEC.
LPS and TNF-α significantly induced ACKR3 mRNA expression (p < 0.001, vs.
control), whereas Ureaplasma spp. enhanced ACKR3 protein expression in HBMEC
(p < 0.01, vs. broth control). Co-stimulation with LPS and either Ureaplasma
isolate intensified ACKR3 responses (p < 0.05, vs. LPS). Furthermore, stimulation
wielded a differential influence on the receptor's ligands.
CONCLUSIONS: We introduce an in vitro model of Ureaplasma meningitis. We are able
to demonstrate a pro-inflammatory capacity of Ureaplasma spp. in native and, even
more so, in LPS-primed HBMEC, underlining their clinical relevance particularly
in a setting of co-infection. Furthermore, our data may indicate a novel role for
ACKR3, with an impact not limited to auto-inflammatory diseases, but extending to
infection-related neuroinflammation as well. AKCR3-induced blood-brain barrier
breakdown might constitute a potential common pathomechanism.
