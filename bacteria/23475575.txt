Neutrophils are the first line of defense against tissue damage and are rapidly
mobilized to sites of bacterial infection. However, the signals that regulate
neutrophil recruitment are not well defined. Here, using photolabel-enabled fate 
mapping in zebrafish larvae, we show that localized otic infection with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces systemic activation and mobilization of
neutrophils from the CHT through Cxcr2 signaling. We have cloned the zebrafish
Cxcr1 and Cxcr2 receptors and show that Cxcr2 functions as a Cxcl8 receptor in
live zebrafish. With the use of morpholino-mediated depletion, we show that
infection-induced neutrophil mobilization from the CHT is mediated by Cxcr2 but
not Cxcr1. By contrast, Cxcr2 depletion does not affect neutrophil recruitment to
the chemoattractant LTB4. Taken together, our findings identify Cxcl8-Cxcr2
signaling as an infection-induced long-range cue that mediates neutrophil
motility and mobilization from hematopoietic tissues, positioning Cxcr2 as a
critical pathway that mediates infection-induced systemic activation of
neutrophils.
