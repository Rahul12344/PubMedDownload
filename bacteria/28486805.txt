The combination of supramolecular hydrogels formed by low molecular weight
gelator self-assembly via noncovalent interactions within a scaffold derived from
polyethylene glycol (PEG) affords an interesting approach to immobilize fully
functional, isolated reporter bacteria in novel microwell arrays. The PEG-based
scaffold serves as a stabilizing element and provides physical support for the
self-assembly of the C2-phenyl-derived gelator on the micrometer scale.
Supramolecular hydrogel microwell arrays with various shapes and sizes were used 
to isolate single or small numbers of Escherichia coli TOP10
pTetR-LasR-pLuxR-GFP. In the presence of the autoinducer N-(3-oxododecanoyl)
homoserine lactone, the entrapped E. coli in the hydrogel microwell arrays showed
an increased GFP expression. The shape and size of microwell arrays did not
influence the fluorescence intensity and the projected size of the bacteria
markedly, while the population density of seeded bacteria affected the number of 
bacteria expressing GFP per well. The hydrogel microwell arrays can be further
used to investigate quorum sensing, reflecting communication in inter- and
intraspecies bacterial communities for biology applications in the field of
biosensors. In the future, these self-assembled hydrogel microwell arrays can
also be used as a substrate to detect bacteria via secreted autoinducers.
