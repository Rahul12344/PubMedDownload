While granulysin has been suggested to play an important role in adaptive immune 
responses against bacterial infections by killing pathogens, and molecular force 
for protein-protein interaction or protein-bacteria interaction may designate the
specific functions of a protein, the molecular-force basis underlying the
bacteriolytic effects of granulysin at single-molecule level remains unknown.
Here, we produced and purified bactericidal domain of macaque granulysin (GNL).
Our bacterial lysis assays suggested that GNL could efficiently kill bacteria
such as Listeria monocytogenes. Furthermore, we found that the interaction force 
between GNL and L. monocytogenes measured by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) was
about 22.5 pN. Importantly, our AFM-based single molecular analysis suggested
that granulysin might lyse the bacteria not only through electrostatic
interactions but also by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction. Thus,
this work provides a previous unknown mechanism for bacteriolytic effects of
granulysin.
