BACKGROUND: Bacterial strains of the genus Geobacillus grow at high temperatures 
of 50-75 °C and could thus be useful for biotechnological applications. However, 
genetic manipulation of these species is difficult because the current techniques
for transforming Geobacillus species are not efficient. In this study, we
developed an easy and efficient method for transforming Geobacillus kaustophilus 
using the conjugative plasmid pLS20cat.
RESULTS: We constructed a transformation system comprising (i) a mobilizable
Bacillus subtilis-G. kaustophilus shuttle plasmid named pGK1 that carries the
elements for selection and replication in Geobacillus, and (ii) a
pLS20cat-harboring B. subtilis donor strain expressing the dam methylase gene of 
Escherichia coli and the conjugation-stimulating rapLS20 gene of pLS20cat. This
system can be used to efficiently introduce pGK1 into G. kaustophilus by
mobilization in a pLS20cat-dependent way. Whereas the thermostable kanamycin
marker and Geobacillus replication origin of pGK1 as well as expression of dam
methylase in the donor were indispensable for mobilization, ectopic expression of
rapLS20 increased its efficiency. In addition, the conditions of the recipient
influenced mobilization efficiency: the highest mobilization efficiencies were
obtained using recipient cells that were in the exponential growth phase.
Furthermore, elimination of the origin of transfer from pLS20cat enhanced the
mobilization.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel method of plasmid mobilization into G.
kaustophilus recipient from B. subtilis donor depending on the helper function of
pLS20cat, which enables simple, rapid, and easy transformation of the
thermophilic Gram-positive bacterium.
