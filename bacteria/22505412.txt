Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) are transmembrane proteins that sense
changes in environmental signals, generating a chemotactic response and
regulating other cellular processes. MCPs are composed of two main domains: a
ligand-binding domain (LBD) and a cytosolic signalling domain (CSD). Here, the
crystallization of the LBD of the chemoreceptor McpS (McpS-LBD) is reported.
McpS-LBD is responsible for sensing most of the TCA-cycle intermediates in the
soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida KT2440. McpS-LBD was expressed, purified and
crystallized in complex with two of its natural ligands (malate and succinate).
Crystals were obtained by both the counter-diffusion and the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion techniques after pre-incubation of McpS-LBD with the ligands.
The crystals were isomorphous and belonged to space group C2, with two molecules 
per asymmetric unit. Diffraction data were collected at the ESRF synchrotron
X-ray source to resolutions of 1.8 and 1.9 Å for the malate and succinate
complexes, respectively.
