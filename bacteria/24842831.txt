Autophagy has been postulated to play role in mammalian host defense against
fungal pathogens, although the molecular details remain unclear. Here, we show
that primary macrophages deficient in the autophagic factor LC3 demonstrate
diminished fungicidal activity but increased cytokine production in response to
Candida albicans stimulation. LC3 recruitment to fungal phagosomes requires
activation of the fungal pattern receptor dectin-1. LC3 recruitment to the
phagosome also requires Syk signaling but is independent of all activity by
Toll-like receptors and does not require the presence of the adaptor protein
Card9. We further demonstrate that reactive oxygen species generation by NADPH
oxidase is required for LC3 recruitment to the fungal phagosome. These
observations directly link LC3 to the inflammatory pathway against C. albicans in
macrophages.
