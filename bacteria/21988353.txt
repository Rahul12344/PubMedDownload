A qPCR assay was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of Flavobacterium
psychrophilum, the aetiological agent of bacterial cold-water disease and rainbow
trout fry syndrome in salmonid fish worldwide. A set of F. psychrophilum-specific
primers based on 16S rRNA gene sequences was designed and validated for specific 
detection and quantification of DNA isolated from representative strains of F.
psychrophilum. The qPCR assay exhibited a high specificity for the 16S rRNA gene 
of F. psychrophilum (from 4 × 10(8) down to 11 copies per reaction) but not for
other Flavobacterium species or other bacteria including fish pathogens. This
qPCR-based method proved to be useful in the quantification of the F.
psychrophilum titre present within organs dissected out from diseased fish. As
the F. psychrophilum genome contains six copies of the 16S rRNA gene, we could
infer a limit of detection corresponding to two bacteria per reaction,
corresponding to 800 bacteria per fish tissue sample, and therefore 20 F.
psychrophilum cells mg(-1) of tissue (for sample weighing 40 mg). The qPCR assay 
reported here could be a useful tool for veterinary diagnostic laboratories to
monitor the F. psychrophilum infection level in fish farms.
