In the recent past, about 40 botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) subtypes belonging to
serotypes A, B, E, and F pathogenic to humans were identified among hundreds of
independent isolates. BoNTs are the etiological factors of botulism and represent
potential bioweapons; however, they are also recognized pharmaceuticals for the
efficient counteraction of hyperactive nerve terminals in a variety of human
diseases. The detailed biochemical characterization of subtypes as the basis for 
development of suitable countermeasures and possible novel therapeutic
applications is lagging behind the increase in new subtypes. Here, we report the 
primary structure of a ninth subtype of BoNT/F. Its amino-acid sequence diverges 
by at least 8.4% at the holotoxin and 13.4% at the enzymatic domain level from
all other known BoNT/F subtypes. We found that BoNT/F9 shares the scissile
Q58/K59 bond in its substrate vesicle associated membrane protein 2 with the
prototype BoNT/F1. Comparative biochemical analyses of four BoNT/F enzymatic
domains showed that the catalytic efficiencies decrease in the order F1 > F7 > F9
> F6, and vary by up to a factor of eight. KM values increase in the order F1 >
F9 > F6 ≈ F7, whereas kcat decreases in the order F7 > F1 > F9 > F6. Comparative 
substrate scanning mutagenesis studies revealed a unique pattern of crucial
substrate residues for each subtype. Based upon structural coordinates of F1
bound to an inhibitor polypeptide, the mutational analyses suggest different
substrate interactions in the substrate binding channel of each subtype.
