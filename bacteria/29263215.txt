The extent of NK cell activity during the innate immune response affects
downstream immune functions and, ultimately, the outcome of infectious or
malignant disease. However, the mechanisms that terminate human NK cell responses
have yet to be defined. When activation receptors expressed on NK cell surfaces
bind to ligands on diseased cells, they initiate a signal that is propagated by a
number of intracellular kinases, including Zap70 and Syk, eventually leading to
NK cell activation. We assayed Zap70 and Syk content in NK cells from healthy
human donors and identified a subset of NK cells with unusually low levels of
these two kinases. We found that this Zap70lowSyklow subset consisted of NK cells
expressing a range of surface markers, including CD56hi and CD56low NK cells.
Upon in vitro stimulation with target cells, Zap70lowSyklow NK cells failed to
produce IFN-γ and lysed target cells at one third the capacity of Zap70hiSykhi NK
cells. We determined two independent in vitro conditions that induce the
Zap70lowSyklow phenotype in NK cells: continuous stimulation with activation
beads and DNA damage. The expression of inhibitory receptors, including NKG2A and
inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIRs), was negatively correlated with the
Zap70lowSyklow phenotype. Moreover, expression of multiple KIRs reduced the
likelihood of Zap70 downregulation during continuous activation, regardless of
whether NK cells had been educated through KIR-HLA interactions in vivo. Our
findings show that human NK cells are able to terminate their functional activity
without the aid of other immune cells through the downregulation of activation
kinases.
