Lymphoid cells that produce interleukin (IL)-17 cytokines protect barrier tissues
from pathogenic microbes but are also prominent effectors of inflammation and
autoimmune disease. T helper 17 (Th17) cells, defined by RORγt-dependent
production of IL-17A and IL-17F, exert homeostatic functions in the gut upon
microbiota-directed differentiation from naive CD4+ T cells. In the
non-pathogenic setting, their cytokine production is regulated by serum amyloid A
proteins (SAA1 and SAA2) secreted by adjacent intestinal epithelial cells.
However, Th17 cell behaviors vary markedly according to their environment. Here, 
we show that SAAs additionally direct a pathogenic pro-inflammatory Th17 cell
differentiation program, acting directly on T cells in collaboration with
STAT3-activating cytokines. Using loss- and gain-of-function mouse models, we
show that SAA1, SAA2, and SAA3 have distinct systemic and local functions in
promoting Th17-mediated inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that T cell 
signaling pathways modulated by the SAAs may be attractive targets for
anti-inflammatory therapies.
