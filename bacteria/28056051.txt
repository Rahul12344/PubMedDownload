Up to 10% of cytosolic proteins are dependent on the mammalian heat shock protein
90 (HSP90) for folding. However, the interactors of its endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) paralogue (gp96, Grp94 and HSP90b1) has not been systematically identified. 
By combining genetic and biochemical approaches, we have comprehensively mapped
the interactome of gp96 in macrophages and B cells. A total of 511 proteins were 
reduced in gp96 knockdown cells, compared to levels observed in wild type cells. 
By immunoprecipitation, we found that 201 proteins associated with gp96. Gene
Ontology analysis indicated that these proteins are involved in metabolism,
transport, translation, protein folding, development, localization, response to
stress and cellular component biogenesis. While known gp96 clients such as
integrins, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Wnt co-receptor LRP6, were confirmed,
cell surface HSP receptor CD91, TLR4 pathway protein CD180, WDR1, GANAB and CAPZB
were identified as potentially novel substrates of gp96. Taken together, our
study establishes gp96 as a critical chaperone to integrate innate immunity, Wnt 
signaling and organ development.
