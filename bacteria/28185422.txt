BACKGROUND: We analysed the previously reported association of the HLA-A*24:02,
B*18 and B*39 alleles with type 1 diabetes and diabetes associated autoimmunity
in the Finnish population applying HLA-DR/DQ stratification.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Haplotype transmission was analysed in 2424 nuclear families
from the Finnish Paediatric Diabetes Register. Survival analysis was applied to
study the development of islet autoantibodies and further progression to clinical
diabetes in the prospective follow-up cohort from the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes
Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) Study. The subjects were genotyped for specific 
HLA class I alleles by sequence-specific hybridization using lanthanide labelled 
nucleotide probes.
RESULTS: The HLA-B*39:06 allele was found almost exclusively on the (DR8)-DQB1*04
haplotype in which its presence changed the disease risk status of the whole
haplotype from neutral to predisposing. The HLA-A*24:02 and the B*39:01 alleles
increased the diabetes-associated risk of the DRB1*04:04-DQA1*03-DQB1*03:02
haplotype but the alleles were in linkage disequilibrium and no independent
effect could be detected. Within the DIPP cohort, neither the A*24:02 nor the
B*39:01 allele were associated with seroconversion but were in contrast
associated with increased progression from seroconversion to clinical disease.
DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS: The independent predisposing effect of the HLA-B*39:06 
allele with type 1 diabetes was confirmed in the Finnish population but the
association of the A*24:02 and B*39:01 alleles remained inconclusive whilst both 
A*24:02 and B*39:01 affected the progression rate from seroconversion to
autoantibody positivity to overt type 1 diabetes.
