Natural killer T cells (NKT) represent a group of CD1d-restricted T-lineage cells
that provide a functional interface between innate and adaptive immune responses 
in infectious disease, cancer, allergy and autoimmunity. There have been
remarkable advances in understanding the molecular events that underpin NKT
development in the thymus and in the complex array of functions in the periphery.
Most functional studies have focused on activation of T cell antigen receptors
expressed by NKT cells and their responses to CD1d presentation of glycolipid and
related antigens. Receiving less attention has been several molecules that are
hallmarks of Natural Killer (NK) cells, but nonetheless expressed by NKT cells.
These include several activating and inhibitory receptors that may fine-tune NKT 
development and survival, as well as activation via antigen receptors. Herein, we
review the possible roles of the NK1.1 and NKG2D receptors in regulating
development and function of NKT cells in health and disease. We suggest that
pharmacological alteration of NKT activity should consider the potential
complexities commensurate with NK1.1 and NKG2D expression.
