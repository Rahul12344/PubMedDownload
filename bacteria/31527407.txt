Most growth factors are naturally occurring proteins, which are signaling
molecules implicated in cellular multiple functions such as proliferation,
migration and differentiation under patho/physiological conditions by interacting
with cell surface receptors and other ligands in the extracellular
microenvironment. Many of the growth factors are heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) 
that have a high affinity for cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG). 
In the present study, we report the binding kinetics and affinity of heparin
interacting with different growth factors, including fibroblast growth factor
(FGF) 2,7,10, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF 
β-1), using a heparin chip. Surface plasmon resonance studies revealed that all
the tested growth factors bind to heparin with high affinity (with KD ranging
from ~0.1 to 59 nM) and all the interactions are oligosaccharide size dependent
except those involving TGF β-1. These heparin-binding growth factors also
interact with other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), as well as various chemically
modified heparins. Other GAGs, including heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates A,
B, C, D, E and keratan sulfate, showed different inhibition activities for the
growth factor-heparin interactions. FGF2, FGF7, FGF10 and HGF bind heparin but
the 2-O-sulfo and 6-O-sulfo groups on heparin have less impact on these
interactions than do the N-sulfo groups. All the three sulfo groups (N-, 2-O and 
6-O) on heparin are important for TGFβ-1-heparin interaction.
