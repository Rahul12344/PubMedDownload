Azithromycin (AZM) is a macrolide antibiotic that exhibits anti-inflammatory
activity aside from its antimicrobial effect, a feature that may ameliorate
certain inflammatory disorders and prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients 
receiving stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we investigated the
ability of AZM to influence the function of human monocyte-derived dendritic
cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells. We found that AZM down-regulated CD80, CD86, and
HLA-DR expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated DCs and suppressed
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in
these cells. In addition, AZM increased endocytosis and/or expression of
Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and TLR9 in DCs and suppressed
anti-CD3/CD28-induced CD4+ T cell proliferation and interferon-gamma production, 
an effect that was synergistic with dexamethasone. Finally, AZM suppressed
DC-induced allogeneic T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Our study
demonstrates that AZM modulates DC and CD4+ T cell function and may be of
therapeutic benefit in various inflammatory disorders.
