The function and regulation of the receptorlike transmembrane protein tyrosine
phosphatases (RPTPs) are not well understood. Ligand-induced dimerization
inhibited the function of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-RPTP CD45
chimera (EGFR-CD45) in T cell signal transduction. Properties of mutated
EGFR-CD45 chimeras supported a general model for the regulation of RPTPs, derived
from the crystal structure of the RPTPalpha membrane-proximal phosphatase domain.
The phosphatase domain apparently forms a symmetrical dimer in which the
catalytic site of one molecule is blocked by specific contacts with a wedge from 
the other.
