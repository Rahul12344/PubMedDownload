The outcome of CNS infection is dependent on both the organism and host. Acute
infections are usually cleared with minimal residua. However, chronic infections 
of the CNS, such as HIV, PML, HSV, polio, Lyme neuroborreliosis, and
neurosyphilis, are becoming increasingly recognized as a cause of severe
neurological morbidity, and are poorly understood. We will need to learn more
about the CNS as an immune compartment to increase our knowledge of these
infections.
