PURPOSE: The occurrence of quinolone-resistance genes (qnrA, qnrB and qnrS), the 
presence of mutations in gyrA, gyrB and parC, as well as the expression of efflux
pumps (acrB and acrF) and mutations in the gene ramR.
METHODOLOGY: Were investigated in 30 blaKPC-2-positive isolates of Klebsiella
pneumoniae taken from infection and colonization in hospital patients from
Recife-PE, Brazil. The detection of the qnr, acrB and acrF genes and analysis of 
the mutations in ramR and the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of gyrA,
gyrB and parC were performed by PCR followed by DNA sequencing.
RESULTS: Among the isolates analysed, 73.3 % (n=22) presented the qnrB gene. For 
the DNA sequencing, six isolates (K3-A2, K12-A2, K25-A2, K27-A2, K19-A2 and
K3-C2) were selected and the qnrB1 and qnrB12 variants were detected. This is the
first ever report, to the best of our knowledge, of the presence of qnrB12 in K. 
pneumoniae. This is also the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of the
presence of qnrB1 or qnrB12 with blaKPC-2 in K. pneumoniae in Brazil. Mutations
were observed in gyrA S83 and in ramR. All isolates presented genes for the acrB 
and acrF efflux pumps and the reverse transcription PCR performed showed that the
pumps were being expressed.
CONCLUSION: KPC-2-positive isolates colonizing patients, which also showed qnrB, 
mutation in gyrA and efflux pumps, may be important reservoirs for disseminating 
these resistance mechanisms in the hospital environment.
