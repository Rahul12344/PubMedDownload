Lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTβR) signaling in lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)
regulates leukocyte afferent lymphatic transendothelial migration (TEM). The
function of individual signaling pathways for different leukocyte subsets is
currently unknown. Here, we show that LTβR signals predominantly via the
constitutive and ligand-driven non-classical NIK pathway. Targeting LTβR-NIK by
an LTβR-derived decoy peptide (nciLT) suppresses the production of chemokines
CCL21 and CXCL12, and enhances the expression of classical NFκB-driven VCAM-1 and
integrin β4 to retain T cells on LEC and precludes T cell and dendritic cell TEM.
nciLT inhibits contact hypersensitivity (CHS) at both the sensitization and
elicitation stages, likely by inhibiting leukocyte migration. By contrast,
targeting LTβR-classical NFκB signaling during the elicitation and resolution
stages attenuates CHS, possibly by promoting leukocyte egress. These findings
demonstrate the importance of LTβR signaling in leukocyte migration and LEC and
lymphatic vessel function, and show that antagonist peptides may serve as lead
compounds for therapeutic applications.
