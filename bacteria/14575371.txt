Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum), sea trout, Salmo trutta L., and
Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., were experimentally infected with Flavobacterium
psychrophilum in order to evaluate any species differences in susceptibility to
the bacterium. Furthermore, differences in pathological changes and distribution 
of the bacteria in internal organs were studied. The bacteria were injected
intraperitoneally in two doses, high dose (Hd) 1 x 10(7) colony forming units
(CFU) fish(-1) and low dose (Ld) 1 x 10(6) CFU fish(-1). The mortalities in the
Ld groups varied between 0 and 7.5% and in the Hd groups between 55-70%. No
significant differences in mortality between the species were recorded. Clinical 
signs and pathological findings were similar in the three species and in
accordance with those of rainbow trout fry syndrome. Rainbow trout showed more
pronounced lesions in the spleen compared with the other species. Necrosis of
renal tubular epithelium and haematopoietic tissue was most prominent in rainbow 
trout and Atlantic salmon. Intracellular eosinophilic droplets in the kidney
tubular epithelium were a prominent finding in rainbow trout and sea trout
surviving the infection. The distribution of the bacteria in internal organs was 
similar in the three species, as studied with immunohistochemistry.
