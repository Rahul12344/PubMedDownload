A major clinical challenge is posed by the current inability to readily
distinguish indolent from aggressive tumors in prostate cancer patients. Research
efforts are dedicated to overcome this problem by understanding the molecular
basis of the transition from normal, benign cells to prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN), localized carcinoma, and metastatic cancer. Combined with the
evidence of the phenotypic heterogeneity of benign prostate hyperplasia, primary 
tumors and metastases, it is conceivable that several prostate clones emerge
progressively during tumor progression. We have identified several PSA-PSMA
prostate clones during prostate cancer progression. In this paper we focus on the
susceptibilities of these PSA-PSMA prostate clones to factors that promote
prostate hyperplastic, neoplastic and metastatic development and their
consequences in disease outcome.
