Certain point mutations within gene for ribosomal protein S12, rpsL, are known to
dramatically change physiological traits of bacteria, most prominently antibiotic
resistance and production of various metabolites. The rpsL mutants are usually
searched among spontaneous mutants resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics, such 
as streptomycin or paromomycin. The shortcomings of traditional selection are as 
follows: random rpsL mutants may carry undesired genome alterations; many rpsL
mutations cannot be isolated because they are either not associated with
increased antibiotic resistance or non-viable in the absence of intact rpsLWT
gene. Introduction of mutant rpsL alleles in the rpsLWT background can be used to
circumvent these obstacles. Here we take the latter approach and report the
generation and properties of a set of stable rpsL merodiploids for Streptomyces
albus J1074. We identified several rpsL alleles that enhance endogenous and
heterologous antibiotic production by this strain and show that rpsLWTrpsLK88E
merodiploid displays increased streptomycin resistance. We further tested several
promising rpsL alleles in two more strains, Streptomyces cyanogenus S136 and
Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC14672. In S136, plasmid-borne rpsLK88E+P91S and
rpsLK88R led to elevated landomycin production; no changes were detected for
ATCC14672 merodiploids. Our data outline the prospects for and limitations to
rpsL merodiploids as a tool for rapid enhancement of secondary metabolism in
Streptomyces.
