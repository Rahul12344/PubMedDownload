Effect of DDT and gamma-HCH on the biological properties of staphylococci.

Lukásová J, Lojda L.

The effect of DDT and gamma-HCH in concentrations of 100, 50, and 10 micrograms
on the biological properties of staphylococci was studied. Both substances proved
to be inhibitory to coagulation of rabbit plasma and to penicillinase production,
causing depigmentation of the colonies. The morphological structure of cells is
affected by these substances as well. The growth of the strain is not
substantially influenced. Gas chromatography proved that staphylococci do not
participate in the DDT and gamma-HCH degradation in the medium.
