BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli strains harbouring the pks island (pks+ E. coli) are
often seen in human colorectal tumours and have a carcinogenic effect independent
of inflammation in an AOM/IL-10(-/-) (azoxymethane/interleukin) mouse model.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism sustaining pks+ E. coli-induced
carcinogenesis.
METHOD: Underlying cell processes were investigated in vitro and in vivo
(xenograft model) using intestinal epithelial cells infected by pks+ E. coli or
by an isogenic mutant defective for pks (pks- E. coli). The results were
supported by data obtained from an AOM/DSS (azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulphate)
colon cancer mouse model and from human colon cancer biopsy specimens colonised
by pks+ E. coli or pks- E. coli.
RESULTS: Colibactin-producing E. coli enhanced tumour growth in both xenograft
and AOM/DSS models. Growth was sustained by cellular senescence (a direct
consequence of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-conjugated p53 accumulation),
which was accompanied by the production of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The
underlying mechanisms involve microRNA-20a-5p, which targets SENP1, a key protein
regulating p53 deSUMOylation. These results are consistent with the expression of
SENP1, microRNA-20a-5p, HGF and phosphorylation of HGF receptor found in human
and mouse colon cancers colonised by pks+ E. coli.
CONCLUSION: These data reveal a new paradigm for carcinogenesis, in which
colibactin-induced senescence has an important role.
