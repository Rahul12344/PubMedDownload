NKT cells recognize lipid-based Ags presented by CD1d. Type I NKT cells are often
referred to as invariant owing to their mostly invariant TCR α-chain usage
(Vα14-Jα18 in mice, Vα24-Jα18 in humans). However, these cells have diverse TCR
β-chains, including Vβ8, Vβ7, and Vβ2 in mice and Vβ11 in humans, joined to a
range of TCR Dβ and Jβ genes. In this study, we demonstrate that TCR β-chain
composition can dramatically influence lipid Ag recognition in an Ag-dependent
manner. Namely, the glycolipids α-glucosylceramide and isoglobotrihexosylceramide
were preferentially recognized by Vβ7(+) NKT cells from mice, whereas the
α-galactosylceramide analog OCH, with a truncated sphingosine chain, was
preferentially recognized by Vβ8(+) NKT cells from mice. We show that the
influence of the TCR β-chain is due to a combination of Vβ-, Jβ-, and
CDR3β-encoded residues and that these TCRs can recapitulate the selective Ag
reactivity in TCR-transduced cell lines. Similar observations were made with
human NKT cells where different CDR3β-encoded residues determined Ag preference. 
These findings indicate that NKT TCR β-chain diversity results in differential
and nonhierarchical Ag recognition by these cells, which implies that some Ags
can preferentially activate type I NKT cell subsets.
