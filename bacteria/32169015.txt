Abnormalities in arterial versus venous endothelial cell identity and
dysregulation of angiogenesis are deemed important in the pathophysiology of
brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway is
crucial for both angiogenesis and arterial versus venous differentiation of
endothelial cells, through its dual role on the vascular endothelial growth
factor/Notch signaling and the nuclear orphan receptor COUP-TFII. In this study, 
we show that Shh, Gli1 (the main transcription factor of the Shh pathway), and
COUP-TFII (a target of the non-canonical Shh pathway) are aberrantly expressed in
human brain AVMs. We also show that implantation of pellets containing Shh in the
cornea of Efnb2/LacZ mice induces growth of distinct arteries and veins,
interconnected by complex sets of arteriovenous shunts, without an interposed
capillary bed, as seen in AVMs. We also demonstrate that injection in the rat
brain of a plasmid containing the human Shh gene induces the growth of tangles of
tortuous and dilated vessels, in part positive and in part negative for the
arterial marker αSMA, with direct connections between αSMA-positive and -negative
vessels. In summary, we show that the Shh pathway is active in human brain AVMs
and that Shh-induced angiogenesis has characteristics reminiscent of those seen
in AVMs in humans.
