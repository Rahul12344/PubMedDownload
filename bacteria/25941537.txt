BACKGROUND: Studies have shown a relationship between increased iron content and 
clinical progression, cognitive impairment, and brain atrophy in patients with
multiple sclerosis. Altered phase, as determined by susceptibility-weighted
imaging (SWI), can potentially capture iron content changes.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate phase changes in white 
matter (WM) lesions and subcortical deep-gray matter (SDGM) of patients with
relapsing-remitting (RR) MS treated with interferon beta-1a administered
subcutaneously versus untreated healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: We conducted a 24-week, nonrandomized, open-label pilot study of 23
patients with RRMS receiving interferon beta-1a administered subcutaneously and
15 HCs. Patients were imaged on a 3T scanner at baseline, 12, and 24 weeks;
changes in phase behavior in WM lesions and regional SDGM [mean phase of
low-phase voxels (MP-LPV)], and in SDGM volumes, were measured. Between- and
within-group changes were tested using nonparametric statistics adjusted for
multiple comparisons.
RESULTS: The number (p = 0.003) and volume (p < 0.001) of phase WM lesions both
significantly decreased among RRMS patients over 24 weeks. At baseline, MP-LPV
was lower (suggestive of greater iron content) in total SDGM among RRMS patients 
versus HCs (p = 0.002). Week 24 MP-LPV changes from baseline were not
significantly different between groups in total SDGM or any region except the
putamen (-0.0025 radians in RRMS patients versus 0.0035 radians in HCs;
p = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Over 24 weeks, phase lesions were reduced significantly in the RRMS 
group. These preliminary results suggest that SWI-filtered phase may become a
useful tool for monitoring RRMS disease activity.
