Ki-1/57 is a nuclear and cytoplasmic regulatory protein first identified in
malignant cells from Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is involved in gene expression
regulation on both transcriptional and mRNA metabolism levels. Ki-1/57 belongs to
the family of intrinsically unstructured proteins and undergoes phosphorylation
by PKC and methylation by PRMT1. Previous characterization of its protein
interaction profile by yeast two-hybrid screening showed that Ki-1/57 interacts
with proteins of the SUMOylation machinery, the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme UBC9
and the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS3, which suggested that Ki-1/57 could be involved with
this process. Here we identified seven potential SUMO target sites (lysine
residues) on Ki-1/57 sequence and observed that Ki-1/57 is modified by SUMO
proteins in vitro and in vivo. We showed that SUMOylation of Ki-1/57 occurred on 
lysines 213, 276, and 336. In transfected cells expressing FLAG-Ki-1/57
wild-type, its paralog FLAG-CGI-55 wild-type, or their non-SUMOylated triple
mutants, the number of PML-nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) is reduced compared with the 
control cells not expressing the constructs. More interestingly, after treating
cells with arsenic trioxide (As2O3), the number of PML-NBs is no longer reduced
when the non-SUMOylated triple mutant Ki-1/57 is expressed, suggesting that the
SUMOylation of Ki-1/57 has a role in the control of As2O3-induced PML-NB
formation. A proteome-wide analysis of Ki-1/57 partners in the presence of either
SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 suggests that the involvement of Ki-1/57 with the regulation of 
gene expression is independent of the presence of either SUMO-1 or SUMO-2;
however, the presence of SUMO-1 strongly influences the interaction of Ki-1/57
with proteins associated with cellular metabolism, maintenance, and cell cycle.
