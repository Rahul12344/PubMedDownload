Previously, we reported that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
suppress cellular invasion which was mediated by thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). As the
extending study of the previous observation, we investigated the effect of
NSAID-induced TSP-1 on the cellular growth and its related signaling transduction
of the TSP-1 production. Among diverse NSAIDs, sulindac sulfide was most potent
of inducing the human TSP-1 protein expression. Functionally, induced TSP-1
expression was associated with the growth-compensatory action of NSAID. TSP-1
expression was also elevated by mitogenic signals of ERK1/2 and RhoA GTPase
pathway which had also growth-promotive capability after sulindac sulfide
treatment. These findings suggest the possible mechanism through which tumor
cells can survive the chemopreventive action of NSAIDs or the normal epithelium
can reconstitute after NSAID-mediated ulceration in a compensatory way.
