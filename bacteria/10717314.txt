Chemical analysis for the characterisation of micro-organisms is rapidly
evolving, after the recent advent of new ionisation methods in mass spectrometry 
(MS): electrospray (ES) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI). 
These methods allow quick characterisation of micro-organisms, either directly or
after minimum sample preparation. This review provides a brief introduction to ES
and MALDI MS and a discussion of micro-organism characterisation capabilities.
Some attention is devoted to the analysis of mixtures of proteins, lipids and
other compounds, to the combination of polymerase chain reaction technology and
MS, and to the analysis of whole bacteria and their lysates. The review of
results produced hitherto is concluded with an outlook on future developments.
