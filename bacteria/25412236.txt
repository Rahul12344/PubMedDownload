BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide 
and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is responsible for almost 80% of lung
cancer-related deaths. Identifying novel molecules that can repress the
invasiveness and metastasis of lung cancer will facilitate the development of new
antilung cancer strategies. The aim of this study is to determine the roles of
NUAK1 (a downstream of Akt) and miR-204 in the invasiveness and metastasis of
NSCLC and to reveal the correlation between NUAK1 and miR-204.
METHODS: The expression of NUAK1 in primary human NSCLC tissues was evaluated by 
immunohistochemistry. Real-time PCR was employed to measure the expression level 
of miR-204. The effect of NUAK1 and miR204 on the prognosis of NSCLC patients was
evaluated by log-rank test. The siRNA transfection was used to manipulate the
expression levels of NUAK1 and miR204 in cancer cells. Chemotaxis assay, Scratch 
assay, and Matrigel invasion assay were performed to evaluate the migration and
invasion of cells. Cellular F-actin measurement was used to measure F-actin
polymerisation in lung cancer cells. Western blot was used to detect the
expression levels of corresponding proteins. The Luciferase assay and RNA
immunoprecipitation were used to confirm the actual binding site of miR-204 to
3'UTR of NUAK1.
RESULTS: Increased expression of NUAK1 is correlated with the invasiveness and
metastasis of human NSCLC. Knockdown of NUAK1 inhibited cell migration and
invasion. In addition, this study showed that NUAK1 influenced mTOR
phosphorylation and induced the phosphorylation of p70S6K1 and eukaryotic
initiation factor 4E-binding protein1 (4E-BP1), two downstream targets of mTOR in
NSCLC cells. At the same time, decreased expression of miR-204 promoted NSCLC
progression and, contrarily, manipulated upregulation of miR-204-inhibited cell
migration and invasion. There is clinical relevance between miR-204
downregulation and NUAK1 upregulation in human NSCLC. Furthermore, we found that 
miR-204 inhibited NSCLC tumour invasion by directly targeting and downregulating 
NUAK1 expression. Finally, our data suggested that the downregulation of miR-204 
was due to hypermethylation of its promoter region.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that NUAK1 is excessively expressed in NSCLC
and plays important roles in NSCLC invasion. The miR-204 acts as a tumour
suppressor by inhibiting NUAK1 expression in NSCLC. Both NUAK1 and miR-204 may
serve as potential targets of NSCLC therapy.
