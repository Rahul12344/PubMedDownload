Seeding of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) into the bone marrow requires a
complex interaction between cell membrane and adhesion systems and cell signaling
pathways. We established a multicellular, spheroid coculture model to study HPC
migration in a three-dimensional stromal environment. Here, entry of primary
CD34(+) cells into stroma cell spheroids was independent of the integrins very
late antigen (VLA)-4, VLA-5, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, and the
chemokine receptor CXCR4. Experiments using a panel of bacterial toxins
selectively targeting key regulators of cellular locomotion, the Rho family small
GTPases Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, revealed a considerable reduction or even abrogation
of TF-1 cell migration without an increase of apoptosis or impairment of
proliferation. Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Galpha(i) proteins, showed a
similar effect. In some in vitro invasion assays, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase
(PI-3K) was shown to mediate Rac- and Cdc42-induced cell motility and invasion.
However, inhibition of the PI-3K pathway by LY294002 did not impair TF-1 cell
migration in our three-dimensional model system.
