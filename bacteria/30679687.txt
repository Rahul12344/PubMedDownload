Post Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), caused by Leishmania donovani is the 
dermal sequel of Visceral Leishmaniasis and importantly, is the proposed disease 
reservoir. The survival of Leishmania parasites within monocytes/macrophages
hinges on its ability to effectively nullify immune activation mechanisms. Thus, 
delineating the disease-promoting immune mechanisms can facilitate development of
immunotherapeutic strategies. Accordingly, in the absence of an animal model,
this study aimed to delineate the status of CD8+ T-cells in patients with PKDL.
At disease presentation, the absence of CD4+ T-cells at lesional sites was
concomitant with an overwhelming infiltration of CD8+ T-cells that demonstrated
an absence of Perforin, Granzyme and Zap-70, along with an enhanced expression of
Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and the skin-homing CCL17. Additionally, the lesional
CCR4+CD8+ population was associated with an enhanced expression of IL-10 and
IL-5. In circulation, the enhanced CD8+CCR4+ T-cell population and raised levels 
of CCL17/22 was associated with an increased frequency of PD-1, while CD127 was
decreased. Taken together, in PKDL, the enhanced plasma and lesional CCL17
accounted for the dermal homing of CD8+CCR4+ T-cells, that along with a
concomitant upregulation of PD-1 and IL-10 mediated immune inactivation,
emphasizing the need for designing immunotherapies capable of reinvigorating
T-cell potency.
