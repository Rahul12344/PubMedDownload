Despite objective responses to PARP inhibition and improvements in
progression-free survival compared to standard chemotherapy in patients with
BRCA-associated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), benefits are transitory.
Using high dimensional single-cell profiling of human TNBC, here we demonstrate
that macrophages are the predominant infiltrating immune cell type in
BRCA-associated TNBC. Through multi-omics profiling we show that PARP inhibitors 
enhance both anti- and pro-tumor features of macrophages through glucose and
lipid metabolic reprogramming driven by the sterol regulatory element-binding
protein 1 (SREBP-1) pathway. Combined PARP inhibitor therapy with CSF-1R blocking
antibodies significantly enhanced innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and
extends survival in BRCA-deficient tumors in vivo and is mediated by CD8+
T-cells. Collectively, our results uncover macrophage-mediated immune suppression
as a liability of PARP inhibitor treatment and demonstrate combined PARP
inhibition and macrophage targeting therapy induces a durable reprogramming of
the tumor microenvironment, thus constituting a promising therapeutic strategy
for TNBC.
