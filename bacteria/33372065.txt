The development of three-dimensional cell culture techniques has allowed cancer
researchers to study the stemness properties of cancer cells in in vitro culture.
However, a method to grow PAX3-FOXO1 fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma (FP-RMS),
an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma of childhood, has to date not been reported,
hampering efforts to identify the dysregulated signaling pathways that underlie
FP-RMS stemness. Here, we first examine the expression of canonical stem cell
markers in human RMS tumors and cell lines. We then describe a method to grow
FP-RMS cell lines as rhabdospheres and demonstrate that these spheres are
enriched in expression of canonical stemness factors as well as Notch signaling
components. Specifically, FP-RMS rhabdospheres have increased expression of SOX2,
POU5F1 (OCT4), and NANOG, and several receptors and transcriptional regulators in
the Notch signaling pathway. FP-RMS rhabdospheres also exhibit functional
stemness characteristics including multipotency, increased tumorigenicity in
vivo, and chemoresistance. This method provides a novel practical tool to support
research into FP-RMS stemness and chemoresistance signaling mechanisms.
