92 cases of proven infectious endophthalmitis underwent pars plana vitrectomy
first to identify the responsible agent and directing the antibiotherapy, second 
to remove the abscess and third to make room for intravitreal injection of
antibiotics. A wide spectrum of organisms was isolated (16 different agents).
Prognosis of endophthalmitis depends on (1) the responsible agent and (2) the
reason for developing the endophthalmitis. The prognosis after lens implantation 
was rather favorable, whereas after vitrectomy the results were disastrous. Good 
results were obtained if the infecting agent was Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Results after Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus or Pneumococcus were
bad. Of the mycotic cases, only half of the Candida cases were cured. Other
mycotic infections had a worse outcome.
