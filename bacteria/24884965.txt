BACKGROUND: Vaginal lactic acid bacteria defend the host against pathogens
through a combination of competitive exclusion, competition for nutrients,
production of antimicrobial substances and through the activation of the immune
system. A new human isolate named Lactobacillus crispatus L1 was characterized in
this work, and a preliminary evaluation of its probiotic potential is described
together with a process to obtain a high productivity of viable biomass.
RESULTS: In a simulated digestion process 1.8⋅10(10) cells∙ml(-1) survived the
gastric environment with 80% viability, without being affected by small intestine
juices. Experiments on six different C sources were performed to analyze growth
and organic acids production and, glucose, provided the best performances. A
microfiltration strategy was exploited to improve the cellular yield in 2
L-fermentation processes, reaching 27 g · l(-1) of dry biomass. Moreover, L.
crispatus L1 demonstrated a greater stability to high concentrations of lactic
acid, compared to other lactobacilli. The specific L. crispatus L1
exopolysaccharide was purified from the fermentation broth and characterized by
NMR showing structural features and similarity to exopolysaccharides produced by 
pathogenic strains. Live L. crispatus L1 cells strongly reduced adhesion of a
yeast pathogenic strain, Candida albicans in particular, in adherence assays.
Interestingly a higher expression of the human defensin HBD-2 was also observed
in vaginal cells treated with the purified exopolysaccharide, indicating a
possible correlation with C. albicans growth inhibition.
CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes the evaluation of L. crispatus L1 as potential
vaginal probiotic and the fermentation processes to obtain high concentrations of
viable cells.
