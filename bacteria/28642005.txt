Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) are metabolic enzymes that catalyze the
oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate. Depending on the
electron acceptor and subcellular localization, these enzymes are classified as
NADP+-dependent IDH1 in the cytosol or peroxisomes, NADP+-dependent IDH2 and
NAD+-dependent IDH3 in mitochondria. Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite
that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana disease in animals.
Here, for the first time, a putative glycosomal T. brucei type 1 IDH (TbIDH1) was
expressed in Escherichia coli and purified for crystallographic study.
Surprisingly, the putative NADP+-dependent TbIDH1 has higher activity with NAD+
compared with NADP+ as electron acceptor, a unique characteristic among known
eukaryotic IDHs which encouraged us to crystallize TbIDH1 for future biochemical 
and structural studies. Methods of expression and purification of large amounts
of recombinant TbIDH1 with improved solubility to facilitate protein
crystallization are presented.
