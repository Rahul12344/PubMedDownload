Protein kinase C-ε (PKCε), an anti-apoptotic protein, plays critical roles in
breast cancer development and progression. Although autophagy is an important
survival mechanism, it is not known if PKCε regulates autophagy in breast cancer 
cells. We have shown that silencing of PKCε by siRNA inhibited basal and
starvation-induced autophagy in T47D breast cancer cells as determined by the
decrease in LC3-II, increase in p62, and decrease in autophagy puncta both in the
presence and absence of bafilomycin A1. The mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) associates with Raptor or Rictor to form complex-1 (mTORC1) or complex-2
(mTORC2), respectively. Knockdown of PKCε attenuated an increase in autophagy
caused by the depletion of Raptor and Rictor. Overexpression of PKCε in MCF-7
cells caused activation of mTORC1 and an increase in LC3-I, LC3-II, and p62. The 
mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin abolished the increase in LC3-I and p62. Knockdown of 
mTOR and Rictor or starvation enhanced autophagy in PKCε overexpressing cells.
While overexpression of PKCε in MCF-7 cells inhibited apoptosis, it induced
autophagy in response to tumor necrosis factor-α. However, inhibition of
autophagy by Atg5 knockdown restored apoptosis in PKCε-overexpressing cells.
Thus, PKCε promotes breast cancer cell survival not only by inhibiting apoptosis 
but also by inducing autophagy.
