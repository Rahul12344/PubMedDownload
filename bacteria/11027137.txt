Modified nucleosides in the anticodon domain of Escherichia coli tRNA(Lys) are
necessary for high-affinity codon recognition and reading frame maintenance.
Human tRNA(Lys,3) is the specific primer for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and also
requires nucleoside modification for proper function. We now present NMR solution
structures for the fully modified 17-nucleotide E. coli tRNA(Lys) anticodon
stem-loop domain (ASL). NMR data were also collected for several partially
modified ASLs, revealing the contributions each modified nucleoside
(mnm(5)s(2)U34, t(6)A37, and psi39) makes in transforming the disordered,
unmodified tRNA ASL into the highly ordered native structure. The solution
structure of the native ASL domain provides insight into longstanding questions
regarding both wobble position modification and the nearly ubiquitous t(6)A37
found in tRNAs with an adjacent U at position 36. Native tRNA(Lys) has a U-turn
structure similar to the yeast tRNA(Phe) crystal structure, unlike previously
proposed "unconventional" anticodon structures characterized by stable
interactions between mnm(5)s(2)U-34 and t(6)A-37.
