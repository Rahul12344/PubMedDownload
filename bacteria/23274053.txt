The cold-induced expression system in Escherichia coli is useful and we have
applied this system to prepare the coelenterazine-utilizing luciferases including
Renilla luciferase (RLase), a red-shifted variant of Renilla luciferase
(RLase-547), the catalytic domain of Oplophorus luciferase (19kOLase) and Gaussia
luciferase (GLase). The luminescence properties of the purified luciferases were 
characterized by using 10 kinds of C2-modified coelenterazine analogues as a
substrate. The order of the maximal luminescence intensity for native
coelenterazine was GLase (100%)>RLase (8.0%)>RLase-547 (0.73%)>19kOLase (0.09%)
under our assay conditions. The substrate specificities of
coelenterazine-utilizing luciferases for the C2-modified analogues showed
significant differences, but the emission peaks catalyzed by
coelenterazine-utilizing luciferases were not affected by the C2-substituted
coelenterazine. These results suggest that the catalytic environment for the
oxygenation process of coelenterazine and the excited species of coelenteramide
might be different among coelenterazine-utilizing luciferases.
