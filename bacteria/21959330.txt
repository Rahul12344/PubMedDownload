CD1d-binding glycolipids exert potent adjuvant effects on T-dependent Ab
responses. The mechanisms include cognate interaction between CD1d-expressing B
cells and TCR-expressing Type I CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells (NKTs).
However, the critical NKT-derived factors that stimulate B cells are poorly
understood. We tested the hypothesis that CD1d-driven CD40L expression by NKT
cells influences humoral immunity. Bone marrow chimeras with CD40L(+/+) or
CD40L(-/-) NKT cells were immunized with Ag plus CD1d ligand before measuring Ab 
responses. CD40L(-/-) NKT cells stimulated higher endpoint Ab titers than
controls expressing CD40L. In contrast, immunization of CD40L(-/-) mice revealed 
that CD40L(-/-) NKT cells could not provide B cell help when Th cells lacked
CD40L. We report that CD40L(-/-) NKT cells can provide help for Ab production and
do so cooperatively with CD40L(+/+) Th cells. We suggest that the manner in which
NKT cells provide B cell help is distinct from that of Th cells.
