INTRODUCTION: To evaluate therapeutic results till 5 years after therapy of
obstructive pyelonephritis (OPN) emphasizing regular follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 5 years, 57 patients with OPN were treated. The
patients' charts were reviewed retrospectively for clinical data. These were
completed by a questionnaire.
RESULTS: In the group of 57 patients (average age 56 years), about two third were
women. Urolithiasis (65%) and tumors (21%) were the main causes of obstruction;
fever (91%) and loin pain (86%) the main symptoms. Three fourth of the patients
showed renal insufficiency and nearly 50% anemia. E. coli and Proteus spp. were
the dominating organisms. Sonography detected obstruction in 93% cases. In one
third of cases, CT scan was added; 81% percutaneous nephrostomy and 19% ureteral 
stenting were the initial methods of urinary drainage. During therapy, 23%
nephrectomies (19% complete, 4% partial) were performed. Long-term follow-up
showed 11% recurrent OPN and 33% recurrent UTI.
CONCLUSIONS: After diagnosis of OPN, primary nephrostomy or ureteral stenting and
antibiotic therapy are the first measures. If recurrent urinary tract infections 
or OPN occur, long-term follow-up and low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis may be
discussed.
