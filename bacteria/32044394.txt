Treponema denticola is a spirochete that is etiologic for periodontal diseases.
This bacterium is one of two periodontal pathogens that have been shown to have a
complete three step enzymatic pathway (GTSP) that catabolizes glutathione to H2S.
This pathway may contribute to the tissue pathology seen in periodontitis since
diseased periodontal pockets have lower glutathione levels than healthy sites
with a concomitant increase in H2S concentration. In order to be able to
demonstrate that glutathione catabolism by the GTSP is critical for the
pathogenic potential of T. denticola, allelic replacement mutagenesis was used to
make a deletion mutant (Δggt) in the gene encoding the first enzyme in the GTSP. 
The mutant cannot produce H2S from glutathione since it lacks
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity. The hemolytic and hemoxidation
activities of wild type T. denticola plus glutathione are reduced to background
levels with the Δggt mutant and the mutant has lost the ability to grow
aerobically when incubated with glutathione. The Δggt bacteria with glutathione
cause less cell death in human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs) in vitro than do wild 
type T. denticola and the levels of hGF death correlate with the amounts of H2S
produced. Importantly, the mutant spirochetes plus glutathione make significantly
smaller lesions than wild type bacteria plus glutathione in a mouse back lesion
model that assesses soft tissue destruction, a major symptom of periodontal
diseases. Our results are the first to prove that T. denticola thiol-compound
catabolism by its gamma-glutamyltransferase can play a significant role in the in
the types of host tissue damage seen in periodontitis.
