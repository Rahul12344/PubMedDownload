KaiC, the core oscillator of the cyanobacterial circadian clock, is composed of
an N-terminal C1 domain and a C-terminal C2 domain, and assembles into a
double-ring hexamer upon ATP binding. Cyclic phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation at Ser431 and Thr432 in the C2 domain proceed with a period of 
approximately 24â€‰h in the presence of other clock proteins, KaiA and KaiB, but
recent studies have revealed a crucial role for the C1 ring in determining the
cycle period. In this study, we mapped dynamic structural changes of the C1 ring 
in solution using a combination of site-directed tryptophan mutagenesis and
fluorescence spectroscopy. We found that the C1 ring undergoes a structural
transition, coupled with ATPase activity and the phosphorylation state, while
maintaining its hexameric ring structure. This transition triggered by ATP
hydrolysis in the C1 ring in specific phosphorylation states is a necessary event
for recruitment of KaiB, limiting the overall rate of slow complex formation. Our
results provide structural and kinetic insights into the C1-ring rearrangements
governing the slow dynamics of the cyanobacterial circadian clock.
