The total RNA from lymphoid tissue in Chinese was extracted, and the gene
encoding the mature peptide of secondary lymphoid-tissue chemokine (SLC) was
cloned by RT-PCR. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that there is only one
nucleotide different from that reported, but it doesn't alter the amino acid
encoded. The SLC cDNA was inserted into an expression vector pET-28a(+) under T7 
promoter and constructed recombinant plasmid pET28a-SLC. pET28a-SLC was
transformed to E. coli BL21(DE3) and the expression strain was gotten. After
inducing with IPTG for 3-5 hours the bacterium were sonicated. After centrifuging
the supernatant was analysed by SDS-PAGE. An obvious expression band about 18 kD 
can be seen. The expressed product was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography
column, and the purity is up to 90 percent.
