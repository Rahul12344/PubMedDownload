The emergence of adaptive immunity in jawed vertebrates depended on the
appearance of variable immune receptors, BCRs and TCRs, which exhibit
variable-J-constant (VJ-C)-type Ig superfamily folds. Hitherto, however, the
structures of IgV-J-IgC-type molecules had never been characterized in
invertebrates, leaving the origin of BCR/TCR-type molecules unknown. Using x-ray 
crystallography, the structure of a VJ-C2 molecule, named AmpIgVJ-C2, was
determined in amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae). The first domain shows typical 
V folding, including the hydrophobic core, CDR analogs, and eight conserved
residues. The second domain is a C2-type Ig superfamily domain, as defined by its
short length and the absence of β-strand D- and C1-typical motifs. AmpIgVJ-C2
molecules form homodimers, using "three-layer packing dimerization," as described
for TCRs and BCRs. The AmpIgVJ-C2 V domain harbors a diglycine motif in β-strand 
G and forms a β-bulge structure participating in V-V intermolecular interaction. 
By immunohistochemistry, AmpIgVJ-C2 molecules were primarily found in mucosal
tissues, whereas PCR and sequence analysis indicated considerable genetic
variation at the single-gene level; these findings would be consistent with an
immune function and a basic ability to adapt to binding different immune targets.
Our results show a BCR/TCR-ancestral like molecule in amphioxus and help us to
understand the evolution of the adaptive immune system.
