The aim of this work was to test fetal stem cells (FSC) number modification in
relation to clamping time and newborn effect. The results show that a fast
sample, between 20 and 40 seconds, from umbilical cord after fetus birth and
before placental detachment assured a greater quantity of blood useful for the
transplants; and that it was necessary to enrich the collected blood in CD34+
cells with specific clonogenic culture, as this is otherwise a small number for a
donation to an adult. In the "new donors" the effects of the unconscious donation
always depend on the clamping time, which should be the shortest possible to
avoid blood overload, which is very dangerous in the presence of heart
malformation.
