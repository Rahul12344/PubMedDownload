CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) offer great opportunities to develop 
new treatments for numerous malignant and non-malignant diseases. Nanoparticle
(NP)-based strategies can further enhance this potential, and therefore a
thorough understanding of the loading behavior of HPCs towards NPs is essential
for a successful application. The present study focusses on the interaction
kinetics of 40 nm sized carboxylated polystyrene (PS) NPs with HPCs.
Interestingly, a transient association of the NPs with HPCs is observed, reaching
a maximum within 1 hour and declining afterwards. This behavior is not seen in
dendritic cells (CD34-DCs) differentiated from HPCs, which display a monotonic
increase in NP load. We demonstrate that this transient interaction requires an
energy-dependent cellular process, suggesting active loading and release of NPs
by HPCs. This novel observation offers a unique approach to transiently equip
HPCs. A simple theoretical approach modeling the kinetics of NP loading and
release is presented, contributing to a framework of describing this phenomenon.
