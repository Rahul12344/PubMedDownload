The mycobacterial integration host factor (mIHF) is a small nonspecific
DNA-binding protein that is essential for the growth of Mycobacterium smegmatis. 
mIHF homologues are widely distributed among Actinobacteria, and a Streptomyces
homologue of mIHF is involved in control of sporulation and antibiotic production
in S. coelicolor A3(2). Despite their important biological functions, a structure
of mIHF or its homologues has not been elucidated to date. Here, the S. griseus
mIHF homologue (SGR6054) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and
crystallized in the presence of a 16-mer duplex DNA by the sitting-drop
vapour-diffusion method. The plate-shaped crystal belonged to space group C2,
with unit-cell parameters a = 88.53, b = 69.35, c = 77.71 Å, β = 96.63°, and
diffracted X-rays to 2.22 Å resolution.
