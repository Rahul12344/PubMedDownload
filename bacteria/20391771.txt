Hybrid protein, cancer necrosis factor thymosin-alpha1 (CNF-T), when synthesizing
in strain-producer of Escherichia coli SG200-50 with plasmid pThy315, was a part 
of "inclusion bodies" mostly in the form of a high-molecular complex with other
proteins due to the S-S bonds formation. An approach of purification of CNF-T has
been proposed, which is based on the destruction of the complex in the presence
of sodium dodecylsulfate (DDS-NA) and dithiotreitol (DDT) followed by
gel-filtration on Sephadex G-100 and renaturation by ultrafiltration on hollow
fibers. The method allows the isolation of electrophoretically homogeneous CNF-T 
containing no DDS-Na and having high cytotoxic activity against cancer cells of
mouse adenocarcinome L-929. The yield of CNF-T achieved 80% relative its content 
in biomass and 30% relative the total protein.
