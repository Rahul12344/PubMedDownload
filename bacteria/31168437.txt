To find a lipase for synthesis of flavor esters in food processing, a total of 35
putative lipases from Aspergillus niger F0215 were heterologously expressed and
their esterification properties in crude preparations were examined. One of them,
named An-lipase with the highest esterification rate (23.1%) was selected for
further study. The purified An-lipase had the maximal activity at 20 °C and pH
6.5 and the specific activity of 1293 U/mg. Sixty percent of the activity was
maintained in a range of temperatures of 0-30 °C and pHs of 3.0-8.5. The highest 
hydrolysis activity of An-lipase was towards pNPC (C8), followed by pNPB (C4) and
pNPA (C2), then pNPL (C12). K m, V max, k cat, and k cat/K m towards pNPC were
26.7 mmol/L, 129.9 mmol/(L h), 23.2 s-1, and 0.8/mM/s, respectively. The ethyl
lactate, butyl butyrate, and ethyl caprylate flavor esters were produced by
esterification of the corresponding acids with conversion efficiencies of 15.8,
37.5, and 24.7%, respectively, in a soybean-oil-based solvent system. In
conclusion, An lipase identified in this study significantly mediated synthesis
of predominant flavor esters (ethyl lactate, butyl butyrate, and ethyl caprylate)
in a soybean-oil-lacking other toxic organic solvents, which has potential
application in food industries.
