Most of the 1H and 15N magnetic resonances of the 66 amino acid long POU
homeodomain of mouse Oct-3 have been assigned by the combined use of the
two-dimensional homonuclear, and two- and three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR
methods. The sequential NOE connectivities and amide proton exchange measurements
indicate the presence of three helical regions within the domain. The positions
of the three helices correspond well to those of other homeodomains, the
three-dimensional structures of which have already been determined. The present
NMR study provides the first experimental evidence for the existence of a
helix-turn-helix motif in the oct-3 POU homeodomain.
