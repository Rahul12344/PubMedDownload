Leukocytes rapidly lose their surface receptors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
after exposure to various stimuli in vitro. To assess the effect of endotoxin on 
cellular TNF receptors in humans in vivo, binding of biotinylated TNF to
circulating monocytes and granulocytes was determined by fluorescence-activated
cell sorter analysis in six healthy subjects after intravenous injection of
endotoxin (lot EC-5, 20 U/kg). Endotoxin administration was associated with a
transient decrease in monocyte TNF receptors, reaching a nadir after 2 hours (P <
.0001), and a more sustained decrease in granulocyte TNF receptors (P < .001).
Although the decrease in cellular TNF receptors coincided with increases in
soluble TNF receptors types I and II, no correlations were observed between
trough monocyte or granulocyte TNF receptors and peak plasma concentrations of
soluble TNF receptors. Stimulation of human whole blood with endotoxin resulted
in reduced expression of both type I and type II TNF receptors on monocytes and
granulocytes. Endotoxin induces downmodulation of monocyte and granulocyte TNF
surface receptors in humans in vivo, which may represent a mechanism to reduce
excessive activity of TNF during systemic infection.
