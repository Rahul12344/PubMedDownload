The site for catabolite deactivation in the L-arabinose BAD operon in Escherichia
coli B/r.

Bass R, Heffernan L, Sweadner K, Englesberg E.

A series of deletions beginning in the leu operon and continuing into the araC
gene and also into the ara controlling site region were analyzed in reciprocal
merodiploids, e.g., F' A2Cc67/B24delta719, F' B24delta719/A2Cc67, for their
effects on catabolite deactivation (CD). The results of these experiments are
consistent with placing the catabolite gene activator-cyclic AMP sensitive site
in the controlling site region between araB and araO. With a deletion mutant,
delta1109, that places araBAD under leu control when transcription begins at
leuP, the araBAD operon is immune to CD even though araCGA, araP and araI are
intact and functional. To focus attention on the fine structure and related
functions of this region we propose that the three proteins that function therein
have separate sites of action: araI (initiator-site for activator), araP
(promoter-site for RNA polymerase) and ara(CGA) (catabolite gene activator-site
for CGA-cAMP). None of the eighteen initiator constitutive mutants (Ic) tested
have any significant effect on catabolite derepression or on the maximal level of
expression of the operon supporting the view that the araI site may be distinct
from araP and ARA(CGA). A series of constitutive mutants in the araC gene (Cc)
also have no pronounced effect on catabolite deactivation.
