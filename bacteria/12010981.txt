Identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins that can provide
immunological protection against tuberculosis is essential for the development of
a more effective vaccine. To identify new vaccine targets, we have used
immunoaffinity chromatography to isolate class I HLA-A*0201-peptide complexes
from M. tuberculosis-infected cells and sequenced the isolated peptides by mass
spectrometry. From this material, we have identified three peptides derived from 
a single M. tuberculosis protein that is encoded by the M. tuberculosis Rv0341
gene. Although no known protein encoded by the Rv0341 gene has been described, it
is predicted to give rise to a 479-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of
43.9 kDa. The three peptides identified are all nested and were found to be
antigenic, in that they were capable of inducing peptide-specific, CD8(+) T cells
from healthy blood donors in vitro and capable of recognizing and lysing M.
tuberculosis-infected dendritic cells. This methodology provides a powerful tool 
for the identification of M. tuberculosis proteins that can be evaluated as
potential vaccine candidates.
