Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT; EC 2.7.7.3) is an essential enzyme 
in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes the reversible
transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine to form
3'-dephospho-CoA. PPAT from Helicobacter pylori has been overexpressed in
Escherichia coli and crystallized at 296 K using sodium chloride as a precipitant
by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data have been
collected to 2.00 A resolution at 100 K using synchrotron radiation. The crystals
belong to the trigonal space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters 
a = b = 80.50, c = 143.05 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Six monomers
of PPAT are likely to be present in the asymmetric unit, giving a V(M) of 2.39
A(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 49%.
