BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Microbial recognition in the periodontium through
specific leukocyte receptors gives rise to the response which in susceptible
individuals can lead to periodontal diseases. The aim of this study was to
explore the expression of leukocyte receptors in the gingival tissues of chronic 
periodontitis patients and to analyse differences between diseased and control
sites (sites with probing pocket depth <4 mm).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven chronic periodontitis patients were included
in the study. Gingival biopsies were harvested from diseased and control sites
and processed by flow cytometry for the determination of the expression of 16
leukocyte receptors (CD4, CD8, CD11b, CD14, CD16, CD19, CD25, CD28, CD49d, CD49e,
CD62, CD71, CD80, CCR7, Ly6G and HLA-DR).
RESULTS: Expression of all studied receptors was higher in test compared with
control sites (p < 0.005). Sampled sites with less bleeding on probing exhibited 
higher expression of CD16 and CD14 receptors (p = 0.020 and 0.011, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: This study points towards considerable differences in the expression
of leukocyte receptors between diseased and control sites in the same periodontal
patients.
