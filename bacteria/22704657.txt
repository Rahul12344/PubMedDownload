Does high antibiotic consumption still reflect bad practices?

OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to assess the quality of antibiotic
prescription in an intensive care unit because of their high rate of consumption.
DESIGN: A prospective 5-month study was made of the first 50 prescriptions of
ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and imipenem. Treatment was
considered adequate at day 5 if the indication was relevant, with the right
doses, and if the prescription was adapted to the antibiogram.
RESULTS: Fifty treatments were evaluated (38 patients included). Eighty-four
percent (42/50) was adequate at day 5. Glycopeptides and fluoroquinolones
accounted for 2/3 of prescriptions. The absence of de-escalation was the most
common mistake. The severity of presentations was evident with a mean SSI at 68
(22-113), and a mean BMI at 28 (18.5 - 50). Eighty-four percent (32/38) of
patients were exposed to invasive devices, 47% died in the ICU.
DISCUSSION: Most prescriptions were adequate. The patient profile could explain
the high rate of antibiotic consumption. Bacteriological monitoring revealed an
increased prevalence of resistant bacteria, which could explain a high rate of
consumption along with adaptation of the dose to overweight. De-escalation, using
aminosides more frequently, and shorter prescribed courses of fluoroquinolones
should improve consumption rates does not always reflect bad practices, but may
be adequate when considering bacterial ecology and patient profile.
