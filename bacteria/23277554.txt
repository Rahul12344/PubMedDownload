Costimulatory molecules of the CD28 family on T lymphocytes integrate cues from
innate immune system sensors and modulate activation responses in conventional
CD4(+) T cells (Tconv) and their FoxP3(+) regulatory counterparts (Treg). To
better understand how costimulatory and coinhibitory signals might be integrated,
we profiled the changes in gene expression elicited in the hours and days after
engagement of Treg and Tconv by anti-CD3 and either anti-CD28, -CTLA4, -ICOS,
-PD1, -BLA, or -CD80. In Tconv, a shared "main response" was induced by CD28,
ICOS, and, surprisingly, BTLA and CD80, with very limited CD28-specific
(primarily Il2) or ICOS-specific elements (including Th1 and Th2 but not the
follicular T signature). CTLA4 and PD1 had a very subtle impact in this system,
similarly inhibiting the response to anti-CD3. Treg responded to the same
costimulatory hierarchy and to the same extent as Tconv, but inducing different
clusters of genes. In this reductionist system, costimulatory or coinhibitory
engagement mainly elicits generic responses, suggesting that the variability of
their effects in vivo result from temporal or anatomical differences in their
engagement, rather than from inherently different wiring.
