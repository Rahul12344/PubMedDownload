An anaerobic baffled reactor with four compartments (C1-C4) was successfully used
for treatment of acetone-butanol-ethanol fermentation wastewater and methane
production. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 88.2% with a 
CH(4) yield of 0.25L/(g COD(removed)) when organic loading rate (OLR) was 5.4kg
CODm(-3)d(-1). C1 played the most important role in solvents (acetone, butanol
and ethanol) and COD removal. Community structure of C2 was similar to that in C1
at stage 3 with higher OLR, but was similar to those in C3 and C4 at stages 1-2
with lower OLR. This community variation in C2 was consistent with its increased 
role in COD and solvent removal at stage 3. During community succession from C1
to C4 at stage 3, abundance of Firmicutes (especially OTUs ABRB07 and ABRB10) and
Methanoculleus decreased, while Bacteroidetes and Methanocorpusculum became
dominant. Thus, ABRB07 coupled with Methanoculleus and/or acetogen (ABRB10) may
be key species for solvents degradation.
