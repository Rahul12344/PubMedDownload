gammadelta Tau cells, together with alphabeta Tau cells, are abundantly present
in the epithelial layer of the small intestine (IEL) and are essential for the
host's first line of defense. Whether or not gammadelta IELs, like alphabeta
IELs, are derived from thymocytes that encounter self-Ags in the thymus is
unclear. In this study, we report that a natural population of gammadelta T cells
that are specific for the nonclassical MHC class I molecules T10 and T22 are
present in the IEL compartment of mice that do not express T10/T22. Furthermore, 
the small intestinal homing receptor CCR9 is preferentially expressed on
gammadelta thymocytes that have yet to encounter a ligand, and gammadelta
thymocytes with high affinity for self-ligand are CCR9(low). These observations
suggest that the Ag-specific repertoire of gammadelta IELs is not biased toward
thymic Ags. Instead, gammadelta IELs appear suited to respond to novel Ags
revealed in pathological settings.
