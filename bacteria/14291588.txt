Changes in the nucleotide pool of Bacillus licheniformis during sporulation. J.
Bacteriol. 89:1506-1510. 1965.-An analysis of the amount of acid-soluble
nucleotides in Bacillus licheniformis cells showed a 75% increase during
presporulation over that in log-phase cells. Cultures in which presporulation was
inhibited by actinomycin D showed a decrease in acid-soluble nucleotides during
the same time interval. A separation and quantitative determination of the
nucleotides in the pool revealed that the relative proportion of each nucleotide 
remained fairly constant during presporulation. The detection of an intracellular
ribonuclease activity and a decrease of the total nucleic acid concentration in
the cells suggest that the increased pool arises from polymer breakdown. The
effect of actinomycin D on sporulation was examined on both a quantitative and a 
temporal basis. The data indicate that messenger ribonucleic acid is essential
for the completion of the sporulation process and must be resynthesized
constantly.
