D-2-haloacid dehalogenases (D-DEXs) catalyse the hydrolytic dehalogenation of
D-2-haloacids, releasing halide ions and producing the corresponding
2-hydroxyacids. A structure-guided elucidation of the catalytic mechanism of this
dehalogenation reaction has not been reported yet. Here, we report the catalytic 
mechanism of a D-DEX, HadD AJ1 from Pseudomonas putida AJ1/23, which was
elucidated by X-ray crystallographic analysis and the H218O incorporation
experiment. HadD AJ1 is an Î±-helical hydrolase that forms a homotetramer with its
monomer including two structurally axisymmetric repeats. The product-bound
complex structure was trapped with L-lactic acid in the active site, which is
framed by the structurally related helices between two repeats. Site-directed
mutagenesis confirmed the importance of the residues lining the binding pocket in
stabilizing the enzyme-substrate complex. Asp205 acts as a key catalytic residue 
and is responsible for activating a water molecule along with Asn131. Then, the
hydroxyl group of the water molecule directly attacks the C2 atom of the
substrate to release the halogen ion instead of forming an enzyme-substrate ester
intermediate as observed in L-2-haloacid dehalogenases. The newly revealed
structural and mechanistic information on D-DEX may inspire structure-based
mutagenesis to engineer highly efficient haloacid dehalogenases.
