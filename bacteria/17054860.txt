OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of human beta defensin 2 (HBD-2) on
Staphylococcus aureus infection.
METHODS: A minigene of HBD-2 containing pCMV promoter, full length of HBD-2 cDNA,
and BGH polyA tail was generated by PCR amplification and introduced into the
fertilized oocytes of C57/ICR hybridized mouse by microinjection. After gestation
of 3 - 4 weeks, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of HBD-2
peptide in different tissues of the transgenic young mice. Staphylococcus aureus 
was cultured and injected intraperitoneally to wild type mice and transgenic mice
to observe their surviving status.
RESULTS: PCR showed that the HBD-2 fragment had been successfully integrated into
the chromosome of the mice. A widespread expression of HBD-2 gene was found in
many tissues of the transgenic mice: trachea, lung, intestine, esophagus, testis,
spleen, skin, endothelium, brain, etc. Four of the 7 transgenic mice survived the
Staphylococcus aureus infection, and 10 wild type mice all died within 24 hours.
CONCLUSION: HBD-2 may play an important role ion the host defense against
Staphylococcus aureus infection.
