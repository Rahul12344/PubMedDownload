BACKGROUND: The Sahel region of Chad Republic is a prime candidate for malaria
pre-elimination. To facilitate pre-elimination efforts in this region, two
populations of Anopheles coluzzii from Central Chad Republic were characterized, 
their insecticide resistance profile and the possible molecular mechanisms
driving the resistance in the field investigated.
METHODS: Bloodfed female Anopheles gambiae s.l. resting indoor, were collected at
N'djamena and Massakory, Chad in 2018 and characterized for species composition, 
and infection rate was determined using the TaqMan assay. Susceptibility to
various insecticides was assessed using WHO tube bioassays. Cone bioassays were
conducted using various long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Results were
analysed using Chi Square test. Knockdown resistance (kdr) and ace-1 markers were
investigated by TaqMan genotyping.
RESULTS: Anopheles coluzzii was the major vector found in N'djamena (100%) and
Massakory (~ 94%). No Plasmodium was found in 147 bloodfed F0 An. coluzzii (82
from N'djamena and 65 from Massakory). High intensity pyrethroid resistance was
observed with mortalities of < 2% for permethrin, deltamethrin and etofenprox,
and with < 50% and < 60% dead following exposure to 10× diagnostic doses of
deltamethrin and permethrin, respectively. For both sites, < 10% mortalities were
observed with DDT. Synergist bioassays with piperonylbutoxide significantly
recovered pyrethroid susceptibility in Massakory populations, implicating CYP450s
(mortality = 13.6% for permethrin, χ2 = 22.8, df = 1, P = 0.0006;
mortality = 13.0% for deltamethrin, χ2 = 8.8, df = 1, P < 0.00031).
Cone-bioassays established complete loss of efficacy of the pyrethroid-based
LLINs; and a 100% recovery of susceptibility following exposure to the roof of
PermaNet®3.0, containing piperonylbutoxide. Both populations were susceptible to 
malathion, but high bendiocarb resistance was observed in Massakory population.
The absence of ace-1 mutation points to the role of metabolic resistance in the
bendiocarb resistance. Both 1014F and 1014S mutations were found in both
populations at around 60% and < 20% respectively. Sequencing of intron-1 of the
voltage-gated sodium channel revealed a low genetic diversity suggesting reduced 
polymorphism.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple resistance in An. coluzzii populations from Chad highlight 
challenges associated with deployment of LLINs and indoor residual spraying (IRS)
in the Sahel of this country. The pyrethroid-synergists LLINs (e.g. PermaNet®3.0)
and organophosphate-based IRS maybe the alternatives for malaria control in this 
region.
