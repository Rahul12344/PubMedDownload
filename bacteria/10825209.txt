The regulatory factor X (RFX) complex, which contains RFXANK(B), RFXAP, and RFX5,
binds to X and S boxes in major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II)
promoters. In the bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS), which is a human severe
combined immunodeficiency, MHC II promoters are neither occupied nor transcribed.
Thus, the absence of any one subunit prevents the formation of the RFX complex.
Nevertheless, except for a weak binding between RFX5 and RFXAP, no other
interactions between RFX proteins have been described. In this study, we
demonstrate that RFXANK(B) binds to RFXAP to form a scaffold for the assembly of 
the RFX complex, which then binds to DNA. Moreover, mutant RFXANK(B) and RFXAP
proteins from complementation groups B and D of BLS, respectively, cannot support
this interaction. Our data elucidate an intriguing medical situation, where a
genetic disease targets two different surfaces that are required for the
nucleation of a multisubunit DNA-protein complex.
