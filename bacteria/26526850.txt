The natural product curacin A, a potent anticancer agent, contains a rare
cyclopropane group. The five enzymes for cyclopropane biosynthesis are highly
similar to enzymes that generate a vinyl chloride moiety in the jamaicamide
natural product. The structural biology of this remarkable catalytic adaptability
is probed with high-resolution crystal structures of the curacin cyclopropanase
(CurF ER), an in vitro enoyl reductase (JamJ ER), and a canonical curacin enoyl
reductase (CurK ER). The JamJ and CurK ERs catalyze NADPH-dependent double bond
reductions typical of enoyl reductases (ERs) of the medium-chain dehydrogenase
reductase (MDR) superfamily. Cyclopropane formation by CurF ER is specified by a 
short loop which, when transplanted to JamJ ER, confers cyclopropanase activity
on the chimeric enzyme. Detection of an adduct of NADPH with the model substrate 
crotonyl-CoA provides indirect support for a recent proposal of a C2-ene
intermediate on the reaction pathway of MDR enoyl-thioester reductases.
