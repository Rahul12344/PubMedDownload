The sodium (Na(+))-calcium (Ca(2+)) exchanger 1 (NCX1) is an important regulator 
of intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Serine 68-phosphorylated phospholemman
(pSer-68-PLM) inhibits NCX1 activity. In the context of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase (NKA)
regulation, pSer-68-PLM is dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). PP1
also associates with NCX1; however, the molecular basis of this association is
unknown. In this study, we aimed to analyze the mechanisms of PP1 targeting to
the NCX1-pSer-68-PLM complex and hypothesized that a direct and functional
NCX1-PP1 interaction is a prerequisite for pSer-68-PLM dephosphorylation. Using a
variety of molecular techniques, we show that PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c)
co-localized, co-fractionated, and co-immunoprecipitated with NCX1 in rat
cardiomyocytes, left ventricle lysates, and HEK293 cells. Bioinformatic analysis,
immunoprecipitations, mutagenesis, pulldown experiments, and peptide arrays
constrained PP1c anchoring to the K(I/V)FF motif in the first Ca(2+) binding
domain (CBD) 1 in NCX1. This binding site is also partially in agreement with the
extended PP1-binding motif K(V/I)FF-X5-8Φ1Φ2-X8-9-R. The cytosolic loop of NCX1, 
containing the K(I/V)FF motif, had no effect on PP1 activity in an in vitro
assay. Dephosphorylation of pSer-68-PLM in HEK293 cells was not observed when
NCX1 was absent, when the K(I/V)FF motif was mutated, or when the PLM- and
PP1c-binding sites were separated (mimicking calpain cleavage of NCX1).
Co-expression of PLM and NCX1 inhibited NCX1 current (both modes). Moreover,
co-expression of PLM with NCX1(F407P) (mutated K(I/V)FF motif) resulted in the
current being completely abolished. In conclusion, NCX1 is a substrate-specifying
PP1c regulator protein, indirectly regulating NCX1 activity through pSer-68-PLM
dephosphorylation.
