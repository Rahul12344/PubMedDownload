A new esterase gene from thermophilic bacteria Ureibacillus thermosphaericus was 
cloned into the pET32b vector and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3).
Alignment of the estUT1 amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a novel
canonical pentapeptide (GVSLG) and 41-47% identity to the closest family of the
bacterial lipases XIII. Thus the esterase estUT1 from U. thermosphaericus was
assigned as a member of the novel family XVIII. It also showed a strong activity 
toward short-chain esters (C2-C8), with the highest activity for C2. When
p-nitrophenyl butyrate is used as a substrate, the temperature and pH optimum of 
the enzyme were 70-80 °C and 8.0, respectively. EstUT1 showed high
thermostability and 68.9 ± 2.5% residual activity after incubation at 70 °C for
6 h. Homology modeling of the enzyme structure showed the presence of a putative 
catalytic triad Ser93, Asp192, and His222. The activity of estUT1 was inhibited
by PMSF, suggesting that the serine residue is involved in the catalytic activity
of the enzyme. The purified enzyme exhibited high stability in organic solvents. 
EstUT1 retained 85.8 ± 2.4% residual activity in 30% methanol at 50 °C for 6 h.
Stability at high temperature and tolerance to organic solvents make estUT1 a
promising enzyme for biotechnology application.
