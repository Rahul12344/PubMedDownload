Metabolic reprogramming dictates the fate and function of stimulated T cells, yet
these pathways can be suppressed in T cells in tumor microenvironments. We
previously showed that glycolytic and mitochondrial adaptations directly
contribute to reducing the effector function of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) CD8+
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here we define the role of these metabolic
pathways in the activation and effector functions of CD8+ RCC TILs. CD28
costimulation plays a key role in augmenting T cell activation and metabolism,
and is antagonized by the inhibitory and checkpoint immunotherapy receptors CTLA4
and PD-1. While RCC CD8+ TILs were activated at a low level when stimulated
through the T cell receptor alone, addition of CD28 costimulation greatly
enhanced activation, function, and proliferation. CD28 costimulation reprogrammed
RCC CD8+ TIL metabolism with increased glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism, possibly through upregulation of GLUT3. Mitochondria also fused to a 
greater degree, with higher membrane potential and overall mass. These phenotypes
were dependent on glucose metabolism, as the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose 
both prevented changes to mitochondria and suppressed RCC CD8+ TIL activation and
function. These data show that CD28 costimulation can restore RCC CD8+ TIL
metabolism and function through rescue of T cell glycolysis that supports
mitochondrial mass and activity.
