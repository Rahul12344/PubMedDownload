Leukocyte functional antigen 1 (LFA-1), with intercellular adhesion molecule
ligands, mediates T cell adhesion, but the signaling pathways and functional
effects imparted by LFA-1 are unclear. Here, intracellular phosphoprotein
staining with 13-dimensional flow cytometry showed that LFA-1 activation induced 
phosphorylation of the beta(2) integrin chain and release of Jun-activating
binding protein 1 (JAB-1), and mediated signaling of kinase Erk1/2 through
cytohesin-1. Dominant negatives of both JAB-1 and cytohesin-1 inhibited
interleukin 2 production and impaired T helper type 1 differentiation. LFA-1
stimulation lowered the threshold of T cell activation. Thus, LFA-1 signaling
contributes to T cell activation and effects T cell differentiation.
