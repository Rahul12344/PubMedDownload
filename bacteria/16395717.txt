We have investigated the role of the host's CD1d-dependent innate antitumor
immune response in a murine T-cell lymphoma model in vivo. We found that C57BL/6 
wildtype (WT) mice inoculated with RMA/S cells transfected with murine CD1d1 died
at the same rate as mice inoculated with vector-transfected cells. In contrast,
natural killer T (NKT) cell-deficient CD1d or Jalpha18 knockout mice inoculated
with CD1d-transfected RMA/S cells survived significantly longer than mice
inoculated with vector-transfected RMA/S cells, implicating the involvement of
invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in inhibiting antitumor activity in vivo. In contrast 
to the mutant mice, which produced more of the proinflammatory cytokines
IFN-gamma and GM-CSF, WT mice produced significantly elevated amounts of IL-13.
Antitumor activity in the knockout mice was not due to the development of
CD1d-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes or circulating antibodies. However, iNKT
cell numbers were elevated in tumor-bearing mice. Thus, iNKT cells may be playing
a negative role in the host's antitumor immune response against T-cell lymphomas 
in a CD1d-dependent manner.
