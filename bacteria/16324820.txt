Pneumocystis infection leads to a life threatening pneumonia in susceptible
individuals. While depletion or dysfunction of CD4+T cells is a key determinant
of susceptibility to Pneumocystis, the host response that leads to resolution of 
infection or lung injury is less well understood. We had previously shown that
mice deficient in the T cell costimulatory molecule CD28 are susceptible to
infection with Pneumocystis. A detailed analysis revealed that they clear
Pneumocystis with delayed kinetics. This is associated with an influx of na√Øve
CD8+ T cells. Depletion of CD8+ T cells did not alter organism burden, suggesting
these cells are not responsible for clearance. Analysis of the cytokine milieu
demonstrated a consistent increase in mRNA for IL-10 and IFN-gamma in the
CD28-deficient mice. These data suggest that CD28 function in important in the
efficiency of the host response to Pneumocystis pneumonia.
