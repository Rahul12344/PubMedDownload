The use of raw materials obtained by waste and processed through innovative
industrial methodologies has generated an industry of about a trillion dollars in
a short time, and in the near future will provide resources and services for the 
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources in order to ensure a better
and fairer welfare for the human race. The production of nano-fiber chitin
non-woven tissue is in accordance with the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU) bio-economic programs: 100%
biodegradable, ecological, and therefore useful in decreasing dependence on
fossil fuel resources. The aim of our study is the evaluation of different
formulations of a non-woven tissue obtained from electrospinning of a mixture of 
nanochitin fibrils, lignin, and poly (ethylene) oxide (PEO) on the restoration of
damaged tissues. Wound repair is a complex process that involves epithelial and
immune cells and includes the induction of metalloproteinases, inflammatory
mediators, and angiogenic factors. Our in vitro results have shown that all of
the realized chitin nanofibrils-bio-lignin non-woven tissues tested as nontoxic
for human keratinocytes (HaCat) cells. Furthermore, the bio-composites that
included bio-lignin at 0.1% have been able to modulate the expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α, IL-1α, and IL8),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and human 
beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) expression in HaCat cells, suggesting an
anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory role. Taken together, our results suggest 
that our chitin nanofibrils-bio-lignin non-woven tissue represents a
skin-friendly tool that is able to favor a correct and fast wound repair.
