A novel Drosophila melanogaster protein, termed inhibitor-t, that bears 41%
sequence similarity to human protein phosphatase inhibitor-2 has been identified 
using human protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) in the yeast two hybrid system.
Inhibitor-t mRNA is detected in adult males, larvae and pupae and the 184 amino
acid thermostable protein located only in testis. The gene for inhibitor-t maps
to cytological location 86F1 on the third chromosome. Bacterially expressed
inhibitor-t specifically inhibits both mammalian and D. melanogaster PP1
catalytic subunits with an IC50 of approximately 200 nM. A motif -FEX1X2RK-,
conserved between inhibitor-t, inhibitor-2 and its Saccharomyces cerevisiae
homologue Glc8, is demonstrated to be required for binding to PP1.
