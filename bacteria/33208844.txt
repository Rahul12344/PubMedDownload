OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of probiotic supplementation on the
gene expressions of cluster of differentiation (CD) as cell markers and the
concentrations of antibodies and cytokines in human milk.
STUDY DESIGN: Gene expressions of CD28, CD19, and CD38 were determined in milk
from 15 women ingesting daily probiotics (from Greek yogurt) and 12 women who do 
not consume probiotics. Concentrations of antibodies and cytokines were measured 
using ELISA.
RESULTS: Gene expression of CD28 tended to be higher in milk from mothers
ingesting daily probiotics than mothers who did not take probiotics.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration in milk was higher in mothers ingesting
probiotics than those who do not consume probiotics. The increase of IL-6 level
in human milk was positively correlated with total IgA and IgG concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: Probiotic supplementation could enhance the secretion of IL-6 in
human milk. Human milk IL-6 may improve neonatal immunity due to its stimulation 
of total IgA and IgG.
