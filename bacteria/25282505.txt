Severe forms of pneumococcal meningitis, bacteraemia and pneumonia result in more
than 1 million deaths each year despite the widespread introduction of
carbohydrate-protein conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Here we
describe a new and highly efficient antipneumococcal vaccine design based on
synthetic conjugation of S. pneumoniae capsule polysaccharides to the potent
lipid antigen Î±-galactosylceramide, which stimulates invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells when presented by the nonpolymorphic antigen-presenting molecule
CD1d. Mice injected with the new lipid-carbohydrate conjugate vaccine produced
high-affinity IgG antibodies specific for pneumococcal polysaccharides.
Vaccination stimulated germinal center formation; accumulation of iNKT cells with
a T follicular helper cell phenotype; and increased frequency of
carbohydrate-specific, long-lived memory B cells and plasmablasts. This new
lipid-carbohydrate vaccination strategy induced potent antipolysaccharide
immunity that protected against pneumococcal disease in mice and may also prove
effective for the design of carbohydrate-based vaccines against other major
bacterial pathogens.
