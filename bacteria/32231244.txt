Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is a rare autoimmune cause of kidney failure. Here we
report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for primary MN in 3,782 cases and
9,038 controls of East Asian and European ancestries. We discover two previously 
unreported loci, NFKB1 (﻿rs230540, OR = 1.25, P = 3.4 × 10-12) and IRF4
(﻿rs9405192, OR = 1.29, P = ﻿1.4 × 10-14), fine-map the PLA2R1 locus
(﻿rs17831251, OR = 2.25, P = 4.7 × 10-103) and report ancestry-specific effects
of three classical HLA alleles: DRB1*1501 in East Asians (OR = 3.81,
P = 2.0 × 10-49), DQA1*0501 in Europeans (OR = 2.88, P = 5.7 × 10-93), and
DRB1*0301 in both ethnicities (OR = 3.50, P = 9.2 × 10-23 and OR = 3.39,
P = 5.2 × 10-82, respectively). GWAS loci explain 32% of disease risk in East
Asians and 25% in Europeans, and correctly re-classify 20-37% of the cases in
validation cohorts that are antibody-negative by the serum anti-PLA2R ELISA
diagnostic test. Our findings highlight an unusual genetic architecture of MN,
with four loci and their interactions accounting for nearly one-third of the
disease risk.
