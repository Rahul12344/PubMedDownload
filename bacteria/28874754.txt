This study was to explore the mechanism by which reactive oxygen species
(ROS)-induced oxidative stress involved in the pathogenesis of fungal keratitis
using an in vivo experimental keratitis mouse model and an in vitro culture model
of human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Compared to normal control mice and
HCECs, ROS production was markedly increased in fungal corneas and HCECs exposed 
to Candida albicans, accompanied by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) 
activation. Increased products of oxidative markers, malondialdehyde (MDA),
4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), mitochondria DNA 8-OHdG and aconitase-2 were observed in 
fungal infected corneas and HCECs. Fungal infection also increased the mRNA
expression and protein production of heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) and
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), with suppressed levels of antioxidant enzymes,
superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) and
peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4). Interestingly, the levels of ROS, oxidative markers and 
oxygenases were significantly reduced by co-cultured p38 inhibitor SB203580.
Furthermore, SB203580 restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes suppressed by
fungus. Our findings demonstrated for the first time that ROS-induced oxidative
injury is involved in pathogenesis of fungal keratitis via p38 MAPK pathway,
suggesting the novel therapeutic targets for the potential treatment of fungal
keratitis.
