OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the prevalence and clinical and laboratory
associations of fibromyalgia in adults with primary immunodeficiency
(immunoglobulin (Ig) G subclass deficiency (IgGSD) and common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of these observations in 300
non-Hispanic white adult index patients with recurrent/severe respiratory tract
infections and IgGSD or CVID: age; sex; IgGSD; fibromyalgia; chronic fatigue;
autoimmune conditions (ACs); interstitial cystitis (IC); diabetes; body mass
index; serum Ig isotypes; blood lymphocytes and subsets; and human leukocyte
antigen (HLA)-A and -B types and haplotypes. We performed univariate comparisons,
logistic multivariable regressions, and an analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Mean age was 49 ± 12 (standard deviation) y. There were 246 women
(82.0%). IgGSD was diagnosed in 276 patients (92.0%). Fifty-six patients had
fibromyalgia (18.7%; female:male 13:1). Other characteristics included: chronic
fatigue, 63.0%; aggregate ACs, 35.3%; Sjögren's syndrome, 8.0%; IC, 3.0%;
diabetes, 10.3%; and HLA-A*29, B*44 positivity, 9.7%. Prevalences of female sex; 
chronic fatigue; IC; and HLA-A*29, B*44 positivity were greater in patients with 
fibromyalgia. Logistic regression on fibromyalgia revealed three positive
associations: chronic fatigue (p=0.0149; odds ratio 2.6 [95% confidence interval 
1.2, 5.6]); Sjögren's syndrome (p=0.0004; 5.2 [2.1, 13.2]); and IC (p=0.0232; 5.7
[1.3, 25.7]). In an analysis of covariance, there were significant interactions
of chronic fatigue, Sjögren's syndrome, and interstitial cystitis on
fibromyalgia.
CONCLUSIONS: Fibromyalgia is common in non-Hispanic white adult index patients
with primary immunodeficiency, especially women. Chronic fatigue, Sjögren's
syndrome, and IC are significantly associated with fibromyalgia after adjustment 
for other independent variables.
