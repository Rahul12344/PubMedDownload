OBJECTIVE: To detect post mortem changes in fetal hematopoiesis consistent with
infection from liver examination alone.
STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of Glycophorin
C, Neutrophilic elastase, and CD34, in the hepatic parenchyma from fetuses
miscarried as a result of chorioamnionitis (caused by Chlamydia trachomatis) and 
correlated them with the equivalent from fetuses after voluntary abortion
(gestational age: 16th, 20th, and 24th weeks).
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found in the Neutrophilic
elastase positive cells to the advantage of cases with chorioamnionitis over
voluntary abortions (24th week: P=0.0001, t-test) and also at the level of total 
hematopoiesis (20th and 24th week: P=0.041 and 0.004, respectively, t-test).
There was no quantitative difference between the two settings at the level of
erythropoiesis in the three examined periods.
CONCLUSIONS: Fetal infection can be diagnosed from the liver alone. After
detection of changes in fetal hematopoiesis indicative of infection, examination 
of additional specimens of placenta and membranes will document the diagnosis of 
chorioamnionitis.
