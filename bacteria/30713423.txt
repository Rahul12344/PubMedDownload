Purpose: To identify the genetic variation in two unrelated probands with
congenital cataract and to perform functional analysis of the detected variants.
Methods: Clinical examination and phenotyping, segregation, and functional
analysis were performed for the two studied pedigrees.
Results: A novel OCRL gene variant (c.1964A>T, p. (Asp655Val)) was identified.
This variant causes defects in OCRL protein folding and mislocalization to the
cytoplasm. In addition, the variant's location close to the Rab binding site is
likely to be associated with membrane targeting abnormalities.
Conclusions: The results highlight the importance of early genetic diagnosis in
infants with congenital cataract and show that mutations in the OCRL gene can
present as apparently isolated congenital cataract.
