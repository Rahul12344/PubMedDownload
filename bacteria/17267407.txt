Adaptation stress responses in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and
its relatives involve a growing list of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Previous
work by us and others showed that the antisense RNA MicA downregulates the
synthesis of the outer membrane protein OmpA upon entry into stationary phase.
This regulation is Hfq-dependent and occurs by MicA-dependent translational
inhibition which facilitates mRNA decay. In this article, we investigate the
transcriptional regulation of the micA gene. Induction of MicA is dependent on
the alarmone ppGpp, suggestive of alternative sigma factor involvement, yet MicA 
accumulates in the absence of the general stress/stationary phase sigma(S). We
identified stress conditions that induce high MicA levels even during exponential
growth-a phase in which MicA levels are low (ethanol, hyperosmolarity and heat
shock). Such treatments are sensed as envelope stress, upon which the
extracytoplasmic sigma factor sigma(E) is activated. The strict dependence of
micA transcription on sigma(E) is supported by three observations. Induced
overexpression of sigma(E) increases micA transcription, an DeltarpoE mutant
displays undetectable MicA levels and the micA promoter has the consensus
sigma(E) signature. Thus, MicA is part of the sigma(E) regulon and downregulates 
its target gene, ompA, probably to alleviate membrane stress.
