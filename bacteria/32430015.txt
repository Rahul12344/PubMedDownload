Equine theileriosis, a tick-transmitted disease caused by the hemoprotozoan
parasites Theileria equi and Theileria haneyi, affects equids throughout tropical
and subtropical regions of the world. It is a significant regulatory concern in
non-endemic countries, where testing for equine theileriosis is required prior to
horse import to prevent parasite entry. Within endemic areas, infection causes
significant morbidity and mortality, leading to economic losses. No vaccine for
equine theileriosis is available, and current drug treatment protocols are
inconsistent and associated with significant side effects. Recent work has
revealed substantial genetic variability among equine theileriosis organisms, and
analysis of ribosomal DNA from affected animals around the world indicates that
the organisms can be grouped into five distinct clades. As these diverse
parasites are capable of infecting a wide range of both tick and mammalian hosts,
movement of different equine Theileria species between endemic countries, and
eventually into non-endemic countries, is a significant concern. Furthermore, the
substantial genetic variability of these organisms will likely render currently
utilized importation diagnostic tests unable to detect all equine Theileria spp. 
To this end, more complete characterization of these diverse parasites is
critical to the continued global control of equine theileriosis. This review
discusses current knowledge of equine Theileria spp. in this context, and
highlights new opportunities and challenges for workers in this field.
