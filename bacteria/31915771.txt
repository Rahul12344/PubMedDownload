Studies have emphasised the importance of combustion-derived particles in
eliciting adverse health effects, especially those produced by diesel vehicles.
In contrast, few investigations have explored the potential toxicity of particles
derived from tyre and brake wear, despite their significant contributions to
total roadside particulate mass. The objective of this study was to compare the
relative toxicity of compositionally distinct brake abrasion dust (BAD) and
diesel exhaust particles (DEP) in a cellular model that is relevant to human
airways. Although BAD contained considerably more metals/metalloids than DEP (as 
determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) similar toxicological
profiles were observed in U937 monocyte-derived macrophages following 24 h
exposures to 4-25 μg ml-1 doses of either particle type. Responses to the
particles were characterised by dose-dependent decreases in mitochondrial
depolarisation (p ≤ 0.001), increased secretion of IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α (p ≤
0.05 to p ≤ 0.001) and decreased phagocytosis of S. aureus (p ≤ 0.001). This
phagocytic deficit recovered, and the inflammatory response resolved when
challenged cells were incubated for a further 24 h in particle-free media. These 
responses were abrogated by metal chelation using desferroxamine. At minimally
cytotoxic doses both DEP and BAD perturbed bacterial clearance and promoted
inflammatory responses in U937 cells with similar potency. These data emphasise
the requirement to consider contributions of abrasion particles to
traffic-related clinical health effects.
