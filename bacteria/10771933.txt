A total of 540 women (including 70 pregnant cases) of child bearing age with bad 
obstetrical history were tested serologically for anti-toxoplasma antibody using 
microlatex agglutination test. Forty two women including 5 cases of pregnancy
were found to be seropositive in a titre of 1:32 or more. Maximum prevalence
(10.2%) and highest titer of anti-toxoplasma antibodies were observed in women of
35-42 years age group. The overall prevalence of toxoplasmosis in these women was
7.7%, whereas it was 7.1% in pregnant women. Further studies are needed to
estimate the exact rate of prevalence of infection. Of the 70 pregnant women, 5
were seropositive and two of them acquired infection during pregnancy which was
detected by IgM immunosorbent assay. Seropositive pregnant women were treated
using combined regimen of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine. Four infected women
with pregnancy were followed up and one did not turn up subsequently. There was
spontaneous abortion in one case and in 3 other cases full term normal babies
were delivered. Incidence of toxoplasmosis in women is low because of infrequent 
and uncommon practices of ingesting undercooked or uncooked food stuff specially 
meat by a substantial number of the population surveyed.
