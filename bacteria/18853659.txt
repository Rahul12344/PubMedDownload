Pneumonia is the most frequently occurring hospital-acquired infection in
Intensive Care Units (ICU). The frequency of bacteriological pathogenic factors
in the surgical ICU and efficiency of empiric antibiotic therapy used in ICU was 
assessed. The study included 239 ICU patients in the I Department of General
Surgery and Gastroenterological Surgery Clinics of Jagiellonian University
Hospital in 2006 year. The bronchoscope materials were worked out with the
application of qualitative and quantitative diagnostic methods. Identification of
bacteria strains was based on the qualification of their biochemical
characteristics based on commercially available tests (bio-Merieux): ID 32E and
ID 32GN for rod-shaped (bacilli) bacteria and tests ID 32 STAPH and api 20 STREP 
that were applied to identify spherical (cocci) bacteria. Sensitivity to
medicines was marked in the automatic system VITEK 2 (bio-Merieux). The ability
to produce extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was marked with double disc
test (DDT). The immunity to meticiline was marked with diffusion-disc test and
with E test method (AB BIODISK). The most frequently isolated gram-negative
bacteria (92.3%). Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens constituted the
largest percentage of bacteria strains resistant to many antibiotics. Change of
antibiotic used was necessary in 24.3% of patients.
