We find that purified CD4+ T cells from 30 HIV+ individuals have a suppressed
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) production compared to normal controls regardless of
activator (anti-CD3 or Con A) or co-activator [phorbol ester (PMA or anti-CD28)],
generally by 2-4 fold. In every case, the cells producing IL-4 respond more
strongly to anti-CD28 co-activation than to PMA, ie, 1150 pg/ml compared to 2070 
pg/ml for controls and 398 pg/ml compared to 1250 pg/ml for HIV+ cells,
respectively. In contrast, anti-CD3 with PMA gives a more vigorous IL-2 response 
than with anti-CD28, ie, 37.3 ng/ml compared to 12.3 ng/ml for controls and 28.5 
ng/ml versus 15.1 ng/ml for HIV+ cells, respectively. These data are not
compatible with the TH1/TH2 switch hypothesis since IL-4 production is decreased,
not increased for CD4+ HIV+ T-cells and while IL-2 production is decreased with
PMA, it is not decreased significantly with anti-CD28. Interestingly, 5 mM
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts as an immunoenhancer; mitogenesis was enhanced 2 fold
or more in general for control and HIV+ CD4+ T-cells and IL-2 production was
enhanced 2-3 fold for anti-CD3 (with PMA or anti-CD28) for both controls and HIV+
CD4+ cells. However, NAC suppressed IL-4 production induced by anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28 in both control and HIV+ CD4+ T cells. In the other cases, it produced 
in general no significant change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
