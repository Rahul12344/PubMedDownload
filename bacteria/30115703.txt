Deep sequencing has revealed that epigenetic modifiers are the most mutated genes
in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Thus, elucidating epigenetic dysregulation in
AML is crucial to understand disease mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that metal 
response element binding transcription factor 2/polycomblike 2 (MTF2/PCL2) plays 
a fundamental role in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and that its loss 
elicits an altered epigenetic state underlying refractory AML. Unbiased systems
analyses identified the loss of MTF2-PRC2 repression of MDM2 as central to, and
therefore a biomarker for, refractory AML. Thus, immature MTF2-deficient
CD34+CD38- cells overexpress MDM2, thereby inhibiting p53 that leads to
chemoresistance due to defects in cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. Targeting 
this dysregulated signaling pathway by MTF2 overexpression or MDM2 inhibitors
sensitized refractory patient leukemic cells to induction chemotherapeutics and
prevented relapse in AML patient-derived xenograft mice. Therefore, we have
uncovered a direct epigenetic mechanism by which MTF2 functions as a tumor
suppressor required for AML chemotherapeutic sensitivity and identified a
potential therapeutic strategy to treat refractory AML.Significance: MTF2
deficiency predicts refractory AML at diagnosis. MTF2 represses MDM2 in
hematopoietic cells and its loss in AML results in chemoresistance. Inhibiting
p53 degradation by overexpressing MTF2 in vitro or by using MDM2 inhibitors in
vivo sensitizes MTF2-deficient refractory AML cells to a standard
induction-chemotherapy regimen. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1376-89. ©2018 AACR. See
