OBJECTIVE: Fibrin sealants have been used for hemostasis, sealant for
cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and adhesive barrier in neurosurgery. Further, as
its clinical use and role of an effective drug delivery vehicle have been
proposed. This study was performed to measure antibacterial activity and
continuous local antibiotic release from different concentrations of
vancomycin-impregnated fibrin sealant in vitro.
METHODS: Antibacterial activity was investigated by disk diffusion test by
measuring the diameter of the growth inhibition zone of bacteria
(methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC29213) from vancomycin-embedded
fibrin sealant disc diluted at five different concentrations (C1-C5; 8.33, 4.167,
0.83, 0.083, and 0.0083 mg/disc, respectively). Continuous and conditioned
release of vancomycin concentration (for 2 weeks and for 5 days, respectively)
were also measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. To
mimic the physiologic wound conditions with in vitro, conditioned vancomycin
release in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was measured and replaced PBS for five
consecutive days, half a day or completely daily.
RESULTS: In the disk diffusion test, the mean diameters of bacterial inhibition
zone were 2.54±0.07 cm, 2.61±0.12 cm, and 2.13±0.15 cm (C1, C2, and C3
respectively) but 1.67±0.06 cm and 1.23±0.15 cm in C4 and C5, respectively.
Continuous elution test elicited the peak release of vancomycin from the fibrin
sealant at 48 hours, with continued release until 2 weeks. However, conditioned
vancomycin release decreased to half or more on day 2, however, the sustainable
release was measured over the therapeutic dose (10-20 μg/mL) for 5 days and 4
days in assays of half and total exchange of PBS.
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that fibrin sealant can provide an efficient
vehicle for antibiotic drug release in a wide range of neurosurgical procedures
and the safe and effective therapeutic dose will be at the concentration embedded
of 4.167 mg/disc or more of vancomycin.
