The concentrations of selected air quality parameters in aircraft cabins were
investigated including particle numbers in cabin air compared to fresh air and
recirculation air, the microbiological contamination and the concentration of
volatile organic compounds (VOC). The Airbus types A310 of Swissair and A340 of
Lufthansa were used for measurements. The particles were found to be mainly
emitted by the passengers, especially by smokers. Depending on recirculation
filter efficiency the recirculation air contained a lower or equal amount of
particles compared to the fresh air, whereas the amount of bacteria exceeded
reported concentrations within other indoor spaces. The detected species were
mainly non-pathogenic, with droplet infection over short distances identified as 
the only health risk. The concentration of volatile organic compounds (VOC) were 
well below threshold values. Ethanol was identified as the compound with the
highest amount in cabin air. Further organics were emitted by the passengers--as 
metabolic products or by smoking--and on ground as engine exhaust (bad airport
air quality). Cleaning agents may be the source of further compounds.
