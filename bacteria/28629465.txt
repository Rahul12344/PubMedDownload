BACKGROUND: Natural IgM antibodies (Abs) function as innate immune sensors of
injury via recognition of neoepitopes expressed on damaged cells, although how
this recognition systems function following spinal cord injury (SCI) exposes
various neoepitopes and their precise nature remains largely unknown. Here, we
investigated the role of two natural IgM monoclonal Abs (mAbs), B4 and C2, that
recognize post-ischemic neoepitopes following ischemia and reperfusion in other
tissues.
METHODS: Identification of post-SCI expressed neoepitopes was examined using
previously characterized monoclonal Abs (B4 and C2 mAbs). The role of post-SCI
neoepitopes and their recognition by natural IgM Abs in propagating secondary
injury was examined in Ab-deficient Rag1-/- or wild type C57BL/6 mice using Ab
reconstitution experiments and neoepitope-targeted therapeutic studies,
respectively.
RESULTS: Administration of B4 or C2 mAb following murine SCI increased lesion
size and worsened functional outcome in otherwise protected Ab-deficient Rag1-/- 
mice. Injury correlated with colocalized deposition of IgM and C3d in injured
spinal cords from both mAb reconstituted Rag1-/- mice and untreated wild-type
mice. Depletion of peritoneal B1 B cells, a source of natural Abs, reduced
circulating levels of IgM with B4 (annexin-IV) and C2 (subset of phospholipids)
reactivity, reduced IgM and complement deposition in the spinal cord, and
protected against SCI. We therefore investigated whether the B4 neoepitope
represents a therapeutic target for complement inhibition. B4-Crry, a fusion
protein consisting of a single-chain Ab derived from B4 mAb, linked to the
complement inhibitor Crry, significantly protected against SCI. B4-Crry exhibited
a dual function in that it inhibited both the binding of pathogenic IgM and
blocked complement activation in the spinal cord.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies important neoepitopes expressed within the
spinal cord after injury. These neoepitopes are recognized by clonally specific
natural IgM Abs that activate complement and drive pathology. We demonstrate that
these neoepitopes represent novel targets for the therapeutic delivery of a
complement inhibitor, and possibly other payload, to the injured spinal cord.
