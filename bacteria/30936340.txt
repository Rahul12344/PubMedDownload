Upper cervical osteomyelitis is rare. Its presenting features are fever and neck 
pain, but rarely it can involve lower nerves. MRI is the main imaging modality,
but it is difficult to interpret due to the unique anatomy of C1 and C2 vertebra 
and complex intervertebral joint. We describe a case of a 67-year-old woman, who 
presented with the complaint of loss of voice, neck pain and fever for 5 days.
Despite repeated imaging of neck, the diagnosis was not reached. As the patient's
condition continued to deteriorate, clinical signs of bilateral 10th and 12th
cranial nerve paralysis appeared and lead to a focused workup for base of skull
pathology. Discussion with the radiologist helped guide the imaging protocol,
which leads to the correct diagnosis being made. Treatment was tailored by blood 
cultures and available images. Temporary immobilisation with a cervical collar
and a total of 12 weeks of antibiotics lead to complete remission.
