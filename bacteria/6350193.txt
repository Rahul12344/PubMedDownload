Coliform mastitis.

Jackson E, Bramley J.

The majority of coliform mastitis cases are relatively mild and self-limiting.
Teat dipping and dry cow therapy will not prevent coliform problems, neither do
they cause them. Bad housing and poor milking time hygiene lead to coliform
mastitis. Efforts to control coliform mastitis must be directed at reducing
exposure to the bacteria. In acute cases fluid therapy is indicated to counteract
endotoxic shock.
