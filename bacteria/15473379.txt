Non typhi-salmonella is the most common cause of hospitalization or death
associated with acute diarrhea. It is usually a self limiting disease and
antibiotic therapy is not required, but in immunocompromised people it is
essential. Increasing antimicrobial resistance in salmonella, in future, would
limit the therapeutic options. During 2002, 198 persons were hospitalized for
acute gastroenteritis. The 55% of cases were female, the age ranged between 4 and
94 years and the 25% of them were > 60 years old. The 58.5% of hospitalizations
occurred between June and October. Non-typhi salmonella was isolated in the stool
of 49 persons, with a rate of hospitalization of 24.7% respect to other causes of
gastroenteritis. The incidence of resistance that was defined as resistance to
one or more drugs was 14.3%. Only one non-typhi salmonella showed a multiple
resistance (> four drugs). Among all antibiotics tested, only the fluorquinolones
showed a susceptibility in vitro in all strains. Non typhoidal Salmonellosis is a
public healt problem in the world and it will be important to restrict the use of
antibiotics in medicine and veterinary to reduce the spread of multiresistant
strains.
