Cerato-ulmin (CU) is a fungal toxin class II hydrophobin, involved in Dutch elm
disease. The formation of hydrophobin films at the air-water interface is a key
mechanism which plays a role of paramount importance at different stages of the
fungal development. We present a study on the precursor stages of growth towards 
the self-assembly aggregation film of CU. Atomic force microscopy images of CU
dropped on mica substrates indicate that the system self-organizes in almost
one-dimensional pearl-necklace-like chains, which subsequently collapse and
possibly merge to form extended and rather compact planar films. We propose and
verify a simple model to describe the self-aggregation mechanism in terms of
progressive thickening of the pearl chains due to the successive merging and
collapse of the elementary constitutive units.
