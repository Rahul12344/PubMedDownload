Peri-implantitis-an infection caused by bacterial deposition of biofilm-is a
common complication in dentistry which may lead to implant loss. Several
decontamination procedures have been investigated to identify the optimal
approach being capable to remove the bacterial biofilm without modifying the
implant surface properties. Our study evaluated whether two different
systems-Ni-Ti Brushes (Brush) and Air-Polishing with 40 Âµm bicarbonate powder
(Bic40)-might alter the physical/chemical features of two different titanium
surfaces-machined (MCH) and Ca++ nanostructured (NCA)-and whether these
decontamination systems may affect the biological properties of human
STRO-1+/c-Kit+ dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) as well as the bacterial ability
to produce biofilm. Cell morphology, proliferation and stemness markers were
analysed in hDPSCs grown on both surfaces, before and after the decontamination
treatments. Our findings highlighted that Bic40 treatment either maintained the
surface characteristics of both implants and allowed hDPSCs to proliferate and
preserve their stemness properties. Moreover, Bic40 treatment proved effective in
removing bacterial biofilm from both titanium surfaces and consistently limited
the biofilm re-growth. In conclusion, our data suggest that Bic40 treatment may
operatively clean smooth and rough surfaces without altering their properties
and, consequently, offer favourable conditions for reparative cells to hold their
biological properties.
