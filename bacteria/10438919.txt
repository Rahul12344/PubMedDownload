Stimulation of mature T cells with agonist ligands of the Ag receptor (TCR)
causes rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine-based activation motifs in the
intracellular portion of TCR-zeta and CD3 and activation of several intracellular
signaling cascades. Coordinate activation of these pathways is dependent on Lck- 
and ZAP-70-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of a 36-kDa linker for activation of
T cells and subsequent recruitment of phospholipase C-gamma1, Grb2-SOS, and
SLP-76-vav. Here, we show that TCR partial agonist ligands can selectively
activate one of these pathways, the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway,
by inducing recruitment of Grb2-SOS complexes to incompletely phosphorylated p21 
phospho-TCR-zeta. This bypasses the need for activation of Lck and ZAP-70, and
for phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells to activate Ras. We
propose a general model in which differential recruitment of activating complexes
away from transmembrane linker proteins may determine selective activation of a
given signaling pathway.
