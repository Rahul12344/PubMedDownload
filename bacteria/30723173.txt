T cell activation is initiated by signaling molecules downstream of the T cell
receptor (TCR) that are organized by adaptor proteins. CIN85 (Cbl-interacting
protein of 85 kDa) is one such adaptor protein. Here, we showed that CIN85
limited T cell responses to TCR stimulation. Compared to activated wild-type (WT)
T cells, those that lacked CIN85 produced more IL-2 and exhibited greater
proliferation. After stimulation of WT T cells with their cognate antigen, CIN85 
was recruited to the TCR signaling complex. Early TCR signaling events, such as
phosphorylation of ζ-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (Zap70), Src homology 2
(SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP76), and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (Erk), were enhanced in CIN85-deficient T cells. The
inhibitory function of CIN85 required the SH3 and PR regions of the adaptor,
which associated with the phosphatase suppressor of TCR signaling-2 (Sts-2) after
TCR stimulation. Together, our data suggest that CIN85 is recruited to the TCR
signaling complex and mediates inhibition of T cell activation through its
association with Sts-2.
