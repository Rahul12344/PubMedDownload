INTRODUCTION: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a serious problem of
modern medicine. Patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) develop HAI
significantly more often than patients in other hospital units.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis involved HAIs from three ICUs in southern Poland.
The study was conducted in 2016-2019 on the basis of methodology recommended by
the Healthcare-Associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-Net) and European 
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The objective was to analyse
HAIs, their clinical forms, and microbiological agents.
RESULTS: The study included 3028 patients hospitalized for 26,558 person-days
(pds) in ICU. A total of 540 HAIs were detected; incidence per 100
hospitalizations was 17.8%, incidence density per 1000 pds was 20.3. The
mortality of patients with HAI was 16%, and in Clostridioidesdifficile infection 
(CDI), the mortality was 28%. The most common clinical form of HAI was
bloodstream infection (BSI): 209 cases (incidence rate 6.9%), followed by
pneumonia (PN): 131 (incidence rate 4.3%), and urinary tract infection (UTI): 110
cases (incidence rate 3.6%). The most frequently isolated bacteria were
Klebsiella pneumoniae 16.4%, Acinetobacter baumannii 14.4%, Staphylococcus aureus
11.8%, and Escherichia coli 11.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: A two-fold higher incidence rate of BSI was detected compared to the
average incidence in European countries. BSI of unknown source (BSI-UNK) was
predominant. K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii bacteria were the most often isolated
microorganisms causing HAI. Infection control based on incidence rate for each
type of infection is necessary in ICU to assess the epidemiological situation.
