Streptococcus pneumoniae's polysaccharide capsule is an important virulence
factor; vaccine-induced immunity to specific capsular polysaccharide effectively 
prevents disease. Serotype 1 S. pneumoniae is rarely found in healthy persons,
but is highly invasive and a common cause of meningitis outbreaks and invasive
disease outside of the United States. Here we show that genes for polysaccharide 
capsule similar to those expressed by pneumococci were commonly detected by
polymerase chain reaction among upper respiratory tract samples from older US
adults not carrying pneumococci. Serotype 1-specific genes were predominantly
detected. In five oropharyngeal samples tested, serotype 1 gene belonging to S.
mitis expressed capsules immunologically indistinct from pneumococcal capsules.
Whole genome sequencing revealed three distinct S. mitis clones, each
representing a cps1 operon highly similar to the pneumococcal cps1 reference
operon. These findings raise important questions about the contribution of
commensal streptococci to natural immunity against pneumococci, a leading cause
of mortality worldwide.
