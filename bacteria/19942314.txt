Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a common Gram-negative respiratory 
pathogen. We demonstrated previously that myeloid differentiation
primary-response protein 88 (MyD88) is of utmost importance in host defense
against NTHi. All TLRs except for TLR3 depend on MyD88 for signaling. TLR9, the
TLR for detecting pathogen DNA depends on MyD88 signaling. Here, we investigate
the role of TLR9 during NTHi pneumonia. Alveolar macrophages (AM) from normal
wild-type (WT) and TLR9 knock-out (KO) mice were harvested and stimulated with
growth-arrested NTHi or CPG DNA. WT and TLR9 KO mice were infected intranasally
with NTHi: cytokine and chemokine responses were measured 16h later. Despite
significant reduced TNF production by TLR9 KO AM in response to CPG DNA, no
difference was detected in TNF production after NTHi stimulation by isolated
alveolar macrophages from WT and TLR9 KO mice. Moreover, we found similar
pulmonary bacterial loads, similar cytokine and chemokine levels in WT and TLR9
KO mice, and no differences in histopathology. In conclusion, we were not able to
demonstrate a role for TLR9 in the recognition of and host defense against NTHi.
