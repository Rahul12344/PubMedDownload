Development of targeted therapies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an 
unmet medical need. Cisplatin has demonstrated its promising potential for the
treatment of TNBC in clinical trials; however, cisplatin treatment is associated 
with hypoxia that, in turn, promotes cancer stem cell (CSC) enrichment and drug
resistance. Therapeutic approaches to attenuate this may lead to increased
cisplatin efficacy in the clinic for the treatment of TNBC. In this report we
analyzed clinical datasets of TNBC and found that TNBC patients possessed higher 
levels of EGFR and hypoxia gene expression. A similar expression pattern was also
observed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. We, thus, developed a new
therapeutic approach to inhibit EGFR and hypoxia by combination treatment with
metformin and gefitinib that sensitized TNBC cells to cisplatin and led to the
inhibition of both CD44+/CD24- and ALDH+ CSCs. We demonstrated a similar
inhibition efficacy on organotypic cultures of TNBC patient samples ex vivo.
Since these drugs have already been used frequently in the clinic; this study
illustrates a novel, clinically translatable therapeutic approach to treat
patients with TNBC.
