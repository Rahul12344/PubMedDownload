The dynamic and reciprocal communication between T helper (Th) cells and B cells 
appears to rely on the provision of multiple signals. The first is antigen
specific and is mediated by the interaction between the T-cell receptor (TCR) and
antigen bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The subsequent
signals are provided by the binding of accessory molecules such as CD28 and CD40 
to their respective ligands. Here, Fiona Durie and colleagues discuss the
co-stimulatory role of the interaction between CD40 on B cells and CD40 ligand
(CD40L, gp39) on T cells, and review evidence that suggests blocking this
interaction may induce T-cell tolerance.
