The ability to perform the very simple oxidation of two molecules of thiosulfate 
to tetrathionate is widespread among prokaryotes. Despite the prevalent
occurrence of tetrathionate formation and its well documented significance within
the sulfur cycle, little is known about the enzymes that catalyze the oxidative
condensation of two thiosulfate anions. To fill this gap, the thiosulfate
dehydrogenase (TsdA) enzyme from the purple sulfur bacterium Allochromatium
vinosum was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and
crystallized, and a crystallographic data set was collected. The crystals
belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 79.2, b 
= 69.9, c = 57.9 Å, β = 129.3°, contained one monomer per asymmetric unit and
diffracted to a resolution of 1.98 Å.
