Theileria parva kills over one million cattle annually in sub-Saharan Africa.
Parasite genetic complexity, cellular response immunodominance, and bovine MHC
diversity have precluded traditional vaccine development. One potential solution 
is gene gun (GG) immunization, which enables simultaneous administration of one
or more DNA-encoded antigens. Although promising in murine, porcine, and human
vaccination trials, bovine GG immunization studies are limited. We utilized the
model T. parva antigen, polymorphic immunodominant molecule (PIM) to test bovine 
GG immunization. GG immunization using a mammalian codon optimized PIM sequence
elicited significant anti-PIM antibody and cell-mediated responses in 7/8 steers,
but there was no difference between immunized and control animals following T.
parva challenge. The results suggest immunization with PIM, as delivered here, is
insufficient to protect cattle from T. parva. Nonetheless, the robust immune
responses elicited against this model antigen suggest GG immunization is a
promising vaccine platform for T. parva and other bovine pathogens.
