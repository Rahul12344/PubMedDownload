We report on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and TNF-beta by 
mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes or enriched monocyte
subpopulations from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-typed healthy subjects. The
results indicate that HLA-DR2- and DQw1-positive donors frequently exhibit low
production of TNF-alpha, whereas DR3- and DR4-positive subjects show high levels 
of TNF-alpha production. No correlation between TNF-alpha levels and HLA-A, -B,
and -C genotype was found. The relevance of this quantitative polymorphism to the
genetic predisposition to lupus nephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
patients was investigated. DR2, DQw1-positive SLE patients show low levels of
TNF-alpha inducibility; this genotype is also associated with an increased
incidence of lupus nephritis. DR3-positive SLE patients, on the other hand, are
not predisposed to nephritis, and these patients have high TNF-alpha production. 
DR4 haplotype is associated with high TNF-alpha inducibility and is negatively
correlated with lupus nephritis. These data may help explain the strong
association between HLA-DR2, DQw1 in SLE patients and their susceptibility to
nephritis.
