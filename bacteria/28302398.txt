LuxS (S-ribosylhomocysteinase; EC 4.4.1.21) is an enzyme that catalyzes the
cleavage of the thioether linkage in the catalytic pathway of
S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH) which produces homocysteine and
4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). DPD is the precursor of the signaling
molecules known as autoinducer 2 (AI-2) responsible for the bacterial quorum
sensing (QS) identified as cell to cell communication. Inhibitors of LuxS should 
be able to interfere with its catalytic pathway thus preventing the formation of 
the autoinducer molecules. In this work, the synthesis of 2-deoxy-2-bromo-SRH
analogues was attempted by the coupling of the corresponding
2-bromo-2-deoxypentafuranosyl sugars with the homocysteinate anion. The
displacement of the bromide from C2 rather than the expected substitution of the 
mesylate group from C5 was observed leading to a novel isomeric analogue of SRH
in which Hcy moiety is attached to a ribose ring via C2-sulfur bond.
