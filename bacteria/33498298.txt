Several genetic variants in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), including ancient
polymorphisms, are associated with chronic inflammatory conditions, but
investigating the functional consequences of such mtDNA polymorphisms in humans
is challenging due to the influence of many other polymorphisms in both mtDNA and
the nuclear genome (nDNA). Here, using the conplastic mouse strain B6-mtFVB, we
show that in mice, a maternally inherited natural mutation (m.7778G > T) in the
mitochondrially encoded gene ATP synthase 8 (mt-Atp8) of complex V impacts on the
cellular metabolic profile and effector functions of CD4+ T cells and induces
mild changes in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex activities. These
changes culminated in significantly lower disease susceptibility in two models of
inflammatory skin disease. Our findings provide experimental evidence that a
natural variation in mtDNA influences chronic inflammatory conditions through
alterations in cellular metabolism and the systemic metabolic profile without
causing major dysfunction in the OXPHOS system.
