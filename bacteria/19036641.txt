Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis can cause sepsis and
meningitis. Several risk factors for pneumococcal and meningococcal disease have 
been identified, but the cause of basic differences in susceptibility between
individuals and populations is unknown. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms are
thought to explain interindividual differences in susceptibility. New
technologies provide the opportunity to study the genetic basis of susceptibility
to these diseases. In recent years, several studies have been published on these 
polymorphisms in pneumococcal and meningococcal disease, many with apparently
conflicting results. Herein we provide a systematic overview of all polymorphisms
studied for a relation with susceptibility to pneumococcal and meningococcal
disease. We also propose an initiative to pool genetic data on pneumococcal and
meningococcal meningitis in one biobank.
