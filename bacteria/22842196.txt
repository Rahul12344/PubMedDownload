Hereditary C2 deficiency (C2D) is an important susceptibility factor for invasive
infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as pneumococci and Haemophilus
influenzae type b. The infections are mostly seen in childhood indicating that
antibody-mediated acquired immunity is affected. C2D persons and healthy controls
were vaccinated with ActHIB® and Pneumo23®. Analysis of specific antibodies to
pneumococci serotype 6B, 7F, and 23F, and Hib was performed. Post-vaccination IgG
antibodies against pneumococci serotype 6B and 23F at a concentration ≥1.0mg/L
was found in similar frequency in C2D persons and controls. Post-vaccination sera
from C2D persons showed poor complement-mediated opsonization and phagocytosis of
pneumococci by granulocytes when depending on classical and lectin pathway
activation only, but increased (p=0.007) and equaled that of the normal controls 
when also alternative pathway activation was allowed due to antibody-dependent C2
bypass activation. In conclusion, the C2D persons benefited from the vaccination 
and achieve an increased phagocytic capacity.
