We report here four novel human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A alleles identified
among an East African population during sequence-based HLA-A typing. The novel
alleles were confirmed by sequencing two separate polymerase chain reaction
products and by molecular cloning and sequencing multiple clones. The new allele 
A*9202 is identical to A*0202 at exon 2 and exon 3 except for a single nucleotide
difference at codon 43 (CGG-->CAG), resulting in a coding change from Arginine to
Glutamine. The second new allele has a synonymous change at codon 139
(GCA-->GCG), that differentiates it from A*680101. The new allele has been named 
by the World Health Organization nomenclature committee as A*680105. The novel
allele A*2630 is identical to A*2603 at exon 2 and exon 3 except for a
nonsynonymous change at codon 90 (GAC-->GCC), changed from Aspartic acid to
Alanine. The fourth new allele is identical to A*290201 except for a single
nucleotide difference at codon 138 (ATG-->GTG), resulting in a coding change from
Methionine to Valine. The new allele has been named by the World Health
Organization nomenclature committee as A*2915. Identification of these novel
HLA-A alleles reflects the genetic diversity of this East African population.
