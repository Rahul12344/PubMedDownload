Ribosomes of Escherichia coli were visualized in buffer solution by atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). A series of time-dependent AFM images showed that ribosomes
spontaneously adsorb on mica. Although ribosomes observed in air are forced to
flatten on the surface, the height of ribosomal particles obtained under a
physiological buffer solution is 21.8+/-0.5 nm, which is consistent with the
ideal diameter. We succeeded in observing single ribosomes in a near-native
condition.
