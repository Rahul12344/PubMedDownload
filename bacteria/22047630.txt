BACKGROUND: Foot ulcers are one of the main diabetes complications due to its
high frequency and difficulty of complete healing. There are several factors that
participate in diabetic ulcers development and limited information exists about
the role of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) in its pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the expression pattern of the
main AMPs: Human Neutrophil Peptide (HNP)-1, Human β-defensin (HBD)-1, HBD-2,
HBD-3, HBD-4 and cathelicidin LL-37 in biopsies from diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
METHODS: 20 biopsies from DFU grade 3 according to Wagner's classification and 20
biopsies from healthy donors were obtained. Real time PCR, immunohistochemistry
and primary cell cultures were performed.
RESULTS: β-Defensins were overexpressed in DFU, whereas LL-37 has low or none
expression in comparison with healthy skin. When primary cell culture from these 
biopsies were performed and infected with Staphylococcus aureus, epidermal cell
from diabetic ulcers showed lower LL-37 expression compared with cell cultures
from healthy donors skin.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that though most AMPs are expressed in DFU,
this production is not appropriate to promote wound healing and contain secondary
infections.
