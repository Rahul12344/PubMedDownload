Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) is pathogenic and produces severe
diarrhea in humans. A mutant of EAEC that does not produce dispersin, a cell
surface protein, is not pathogenic. It has been proposed that dispersin imparts a
positive charge to the bacterial cell surface allowing the bacteria to colonize
on the negatively charged intestinal mucosa. However, physical properties of the 
bacterial cell surface, such as rigidity, may be influenced by the presence of
dispersin and may contribute to pathogenicity. Using the system developed in our 
laboratory for mounting and imaging bacterial cells by atomic force microscopy
(AFM), in liquid, on gelatin coated mica surfaces, studies were initiated to
measure cell surface elasticity. This was carried out in both wild type EAEC,
that produces dispersin, and the mutant that does not produce dispersin. This was
accomplished using AFM force-distance (FD) spectroscopy on the wild type and
mutant grown in liquid or on solid medium. Images in liquid and in air of both
the wild-type and mutant grown in liquid and on solid media are presented. This
work represents an initial step in efforts to understand the pathogenic role of
the dispersin protein in the wild-type bacteria.
