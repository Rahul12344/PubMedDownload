CD8+ T lymphocytes have been implicated in the protective immune response against
human and murine tuberculosis. However, the functional role that this cell subset
plays during the resolution of infection remains controversial. In this study, we
demonstrate the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific CD8+ CTL in the
lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes of mice infected with M. tuberculosis via the
aerosol or i.v. route. These cells expressed perforin in vivo and specifically
recognized and lysed M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages in a perforin-dependent
manner after a short period of in vitro restimulation. The efficiency of lysis of
infected macrophages was dependent upon the time allowed for interaction between 
macrophage and M. tuberculosis bacilli. Recognition of infected targets by CD8+
CTL was beta 2-microglobulin and MHC class I dependent and was not CD1d
restricted. The presented data indicate that CD8+ T cells contribute to the
protective immune response during M. tuberculosis infection by exerting cytotoxic
function and lysing infected macrophages.
