Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, secretes two bipartite toxins
that help the bacterium evade the immune system and contribute directly to
pathogenesis. Both toxin catalytic moieties, lethal factor (LF) and oedema factor
(OF), are internalized into the host-cell cytosol by a third factor, protective
antigen (PA), which binds to cellular anthrax toxin receptors (ANTXRs). Oedema
factor is an adenylate cyclase that impairs host defences by raising cellular
cAMP levels. Here we demonstrate that oedema toxin (PA + OF) induces an increase 
in ANTXR expression levels in macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in an
increased rate of toxin internalization. Furthermore, we show that increases in
ANTXR mRNA levels depends on the ability of OF to increase cAMP levels, is
mediated through protein kinase A-directed signalling and is
monocyte-lineage-specific. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a
bacterial toxin inducing host target cells to increase toxin receptor expression.
