We lack strong empirical evidence for links between plant attributes (plant
community attributes and functional traits) and the distribution of soil
microbial communities at large spatial scales. Using datasets from two
contrasting regions and ecosystem types in Australia and England, we report that 
aboveground plant community attributes, such as diversity (species richness) and 
cover, and functional traits can predict a unique portion of the variation in the
diversity (number of phylotypes) and community composition of soil bacteria and
fungi that cannot be explained by soil abiotic properties and climate. We further
identify the relative importance and evaluate the potential direct and indirect
effects of climate, soil properties and plant attributes in regulating the
diversity and community composition of soil microbial communities. Finally, we
deliver a list of examples of common taxa from Australia and England that are
strongly related to specific plant traits, such as specific leaf area index, leaf
nitrogen and nitrogen fixation. Together, our work provides new evidence that
plant attributes, especially plant functional traits, can predict the
distribution of soil microbial communities at the regional scale and across two
hemispheres.
