The thermostability of the methyl parathion hydrolase (MPH_OCH) from Ochrobactrum
sp. M231 was improved using site-directed mutagenesis. Two prolines (Pro76 and
Pro78) located on the protein surface were selected for mutations after
inspection of the sequence alignment of MPH_OCH and OPHC2, a thermostable
organophosphorus hydrolase from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes C2-1. The
temperature of the double-point mutant (P76D/P78K) at which the mutant lost 50%
of its activity (T50) was approximately 68 째C, which is higher than that of WT
enzyme (64 째C), P76D (67 째C), and P78K (59 째C). Structural analysis of P76D/P78K 
indicated that the substituted residues (Asp76 and Lys78) could generate an ionic
bond and increase the structural electrostatic energy, which could then increase 
the stability of the protein. These results also suggest that the thermal
stability of proteins could be improved by adding the ionic bond on protein
surface.
