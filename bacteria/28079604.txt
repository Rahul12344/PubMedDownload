OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies suggest that calcium channel blockers can
improve sepsis outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the association
between prior use of calcium channel blockers and the outcome of patients
admitted to the ICU with sepsis.
DESIGN: A prospective observational study.
SETTING: The ICUs of two tertiary care hospitals in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS: In total, 1,060 consecutive patients admitted with sepsis were
analyzed, 18.6% of whom used calcium channel blockers.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Considering large baseline differences between
calcium channel blocker users and nonusers, a propensity score matched cohort was
constructed to account for differential likelihoods of receiving calcium channel 
blockers. Fifteen plasma biomarkers providing insight in key host responses
implicated in sepsis pathogenesis were measured during the first 4 days after
admission. Severity of illness over the first 24 hours, sites of infection and
causative pathogens were similar in both groups. Prior use of calcium channel
blockers was associated with improved 30-day survival in the propensity-matched
cohort (20.2% vs 32.9% in non-calcium channel blockers users; p = 0.009) and in
multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31-0.74; p = 0.0007). Prior
calcium channel blocker use was not associated with changes in the plasma levels 
of host biomarkers indicative of activation of the cytokine network, the vascular
endothelium and the coagulation system, with the exception of antithrombin
levels, which were less decreased in calcium channel blocker users.
CONCLUSIONS: Prior calcium channel blocker use is associated with reduced
mortality in patients following ICU admission with sepsis.
