Naturally occurring pradimicins (PRMs) show specific recognition of d-mannose
(d-Man) in aqueous media, which has never been achieved by artificial small
molecules. Although the Ca2+-mediated dimerization of PRMs is essential for their
d-Man binding, the dimeric structure has yet to be elucidated, leaving the
question open as to how PRMs recognize d-Man. Thus, we herein report the
structural elucidation of the dimer by a combination of X-ray crystallography and
solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Coupled with our previous knowledge regarding the
d-Man binding geometry of PRMs, elucidation of the dimer allowed reliable
estimation of the mode of d-Man binding. Based on the binding model, we further
developed an azide-functionalized PRM derivative (PRM-Azide) with d-Man binding
specificity. Notably, PRM-Azide stained Candida rugosa cells having mannans on
their cell surface through conjugation with the tetramethylrhodamine fluorophore.
The present study provides the practical demonstration that PRMs can serve as
lectin mimics for use in glycobiological studies.
