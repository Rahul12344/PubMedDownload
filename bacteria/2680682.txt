The impact of retinoic acid (RA) on the expression of the neural cell adhesion
molecules (NCAMs) and their developmentally regulated polysialic acid (PSA)
moiety was studied in embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines. These cell lines are
known to be capable of RA-induced differentiation into neurons (murine P19 cells)
or parietal endoderm (murine F9 cells), respectively. Monoclonal antibodies were 
employed to monitor expression of NCAM and PSA. F9 and P19 cells were both found 
to express NCAM but only P19 cells carried the highly polysialylated "embryonic
form" of NCAM (E-NCAM). The amount of NCAM in aggregated P19 cells but not in F9 
cells was dramatically increased upon treatment with RA. Since NCAMs play an
important role in cell interactions during embryogenesis it is tempting to
speculate that the regulative impact of RA on NCAMs is related to its morphogenic
property.
