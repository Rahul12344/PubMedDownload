BACKGROUND: Chronic sinusitis is one of the frequent inflammatory diseases and
has a complex pathogenesis. A substantial factor seems to be recurrent bacterial 
infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) frequently can be found in nasal smears
of patients with persistent sinus symptoms after sinus surgery. Lately a new
antimicrobial peptide of epithelial origin, human Beta-Defensin-2 (hBD-2), with a
strong antibacterial effect against PA could be identified within lesional skin
scales of patients suffering psoriasis. Aim of this study was to investigate
hBD-2-mRNA expression in nasal cells and tissue.
METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from nasal polyps and turbinates following
TRIzol protocol. Epithelial cells and fibroblasts of nasal human tissue were
isolated and cultivated. The cells were stimulated with PA using different time
points and different concentrations. Total RNA was isolated as mentioned above,
reverse transcribed and amplified in a Semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase
PCR (SQRT-PCR) with genespecific hBD-2 primers.
RESULTS: PA induces time- and dose-dependently hBD-2 gene expression in nasal
epithelial cells. Unstimulated epithelial nasal cells were able to express hBD-2 
mRNA constitutively, whereas nasal fibroblasts showed no hBD-2 mRNA expression.
Nasal polyps showed a comparable less hBD-2 gene expression then nasal
turbinates.
CONCLUSIONS: hBD-2 possibly mediates a specific, early starting antimicrobial
defense strategy of the nasal mucosa. This hypothesis would explain persistent
infections with PA through diminished hBD-2 gene expression.
