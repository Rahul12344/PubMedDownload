CD28 is required for maximal proliferation of CD4+ T cells stimulated through
their TCRs. Two sites within the cytoplasmic tail of CD28, a YMNM sequence that
recruits PI3K and activates NF-κB and a PYAP sequence that recruits Lck, are
candidates as transducers of the signals responsible for these biological
effects. We tested this proposition by tracking polyclonal peptide:MHCII-specific
CD4+ T cells in vivo in mice with mutations in these sites. Mice lacking CD28 or 
its cytoplasmic tail had the same number of naive T cells specific for a
peptide:MHCII ligand as wild-type mice. However, the mutant cells produced one
tenth as many effector and memory cells as wild-type T cells after infection with
bacteria expressing the antigenic peptide. Remarkably, T cells with a mutated
PI3K binding site, a mutated PYAP site, or both mutations proliferated to the
same extent as wild-type T cells. The only observed defect was that T cells with 
a mutated PYAP or Y170F site proliferated even more weakly in response to peptide
without adjuvant than wild-type T cells. These results show that CD28 enhances T 
cell proliferation during bacterial infection by signals emanating from
undiscovered sites in the cytoplasmic tail.
