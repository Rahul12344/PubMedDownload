Tumor endothelium marker-8 (TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG2)
are the two well-characterized anthrax toxin receptors, each containing a von
Willebrand factor A (vWA) domain responsible for anthrax protective antigen (PA) 
binding. Recently, a cell-based analysis was used to implicate another vWA
domain-containing protein, integrin β1 as a third anthrax toxin receptor. To
explore whether proteins other than TEM8 and CMG2 function as anthrax toxin
receptors in vivo, we challenged mice lacking TEM8 and/or CMG2. Specifically, we 
used as an effector protein the fusion protein FP59, a fusion between the
PA-binding domain of anthrax lethal factor (LF) and the catalytic domain of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. FP59 is at least 50-fold more potent than LF
in the presence of PA, with 2 μg PA + 2 μg FP59 being sufficient to kill a mouse.
While TEM8(-/-) and wild type control mice succumbed to a 5 μg PA + 5 μg FP59
challenge, CMG2(-/-) mice were completely resistant to this dose, confirming that
CMG2 is the major anthrax toxin receptor in vivo. To detect whether any toxic
effects are mediated by TEM8 or other putative receptors such as integrin β1,
CMG2(-/-)/TEM8(-/-) mice were challenged with as many as five doses of 50 μg PA +
50 μg FP59. Strikingly, the CMG2(-/-)/TEM8(-/-) mice were completely resistant to
the 5-dose challenge. These results strongly suggest that TEM8 is the only minor 
anthrax toxin receptor mediating direct lethality in vivo and that other proteins
implicated as receptors do not play this role.
