Molecular mapping of crown rust resistance genes is important to effectively
utilize these genes and improve breeding efficiency through marker-assisted
selection. Pc45 is a major race-specific crown rust resistance gene initially
identified in the wild hexaploid oat Avena sterilis in the early 1970s. This gene
was transferred to cultivated oat (Avena sativa) and has been used as a
differential for identification of crown rust races since 1974. Previous research
identified an association between virulence to Pc45 and PcKM, a crown rust
resistance gene in the varieties 'Kame' and 'Morton'. This study was undertaken
to reveal the relationship between Pc45 and PcKM Pc45 was studied in the crosses 
'AC Morgan'/Pc45 and 'Kasztan'/Pc45, where Pc45 is the differential line carrying
Pc45 F2 progenies and F2:3 families of both populations were inoculated with the 
crown rust isolate CR258 (race NTGG) and single gene segregation ratios were
observed. SNP markers for PcKM were tested on these populations and linkage maps 
were generated. In addition, 17 newly developed SNP markers identified from
genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data were mapped in these two populations, plus
another three populations segregating for Pc45 or PcKM Pc45 and PcKM mapped to
the same location of Mrg08 (chromosome 12D) of the oat chromosome-anchored
consensus map. These results strongly suggest that Pc45 and PcKM are the same
resistance gene, but allelism (i.e., functionally different alleles of the same
gene) or tight linkage (i.e., two tightly linked genes) cannot be ruled out based
on the present data.
