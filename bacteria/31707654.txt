Histidine phosphorylation of proteins is increasingly recognised as an important 
regulatory posttranslational modification in eukaryotes as well as prokaryotes.
The HP (Histidine Phosphatase) superfamily, named for a key catalytic His
residue, harbors two known groups of protein phosphohistidine phosphatases
(PPHPs). The bacterial SixA protein acts as a regulator of His-Asp phosphorelays 
with two substrates characterized in vitro and/or in vivo. The recently
characterized eukaryotic PHPP PGAM5 only has one currently known substrate,
NDPK-B, through which it helps regulate T-cell signaling. SixA and PGAM5 appear
to share no particular sequence or structural features relating to their PPHP
activity suggesting that PHPP activity has arisen independently in different
lineages of the HP superfamily. Further members of the HP superfamily may thus
harbor (additional) unsuspected PHPP activity.
