The cob operon encodes functions needed for the biosynthesis of adenosylcobalamin
(Ado-B12). Propanediol induces transcription of the cob operon and the
neighboring pdu operon, which encodes proteins for the B12-dependent degradation 
of propanediol. Expression of the cob (but not the pdu) operon is repressed by
exogenous cyanocobalamin. Evidence is provided that cob operon repression is
signaled by internally generated Ado-B12, which can be formed either by the CobA 
adenosyltransferase or by an alternative adenosyltransferase (AdoT) that we infer
is encoded within the pdu operon. Repression is also affected by mutations (AdoB)
in the pdu operon that map upstream of the inferred pdu adenosyltransferase gene.
Such mutations allow cobalamin to mediate repression at concentrations 100-fold
lower than those needed in the wild type. It is proposed that these mutations
eliminate a component of the propanediol dehydratase enzyme complex (PduCDE) and 
that this complex competes with the cob regulatory mechanism for a limited supply
of Ado-B12.
