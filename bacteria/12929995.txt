OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) -A and -B 
antigens by standard microlymphocytotoxicity assay in Thai nasopharyngeal
carcinoma (NPC) patients compared to normal controls in order to identify the
alleles associated with NPC in Thailand.
DESIGN: Retrospective-Analytical study.
SUBJECTS: Fifty-three unrelated Thai patients with histologically confirmed NPC
diagnosed at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and 70 healthy unrelated Thai
individuals served as controls.
METHOD: Lymphocyte separation and HLA typing were performed from freshly drawn
blood by standard microlymphocytotoxicity assay. The significance of differences 
between the two groups was analyzed by the chi-square test.
RESULTS: HLA-A2 was observed at a greater frequency in patients being found in
31/53 (58%) NPC patients compared to 27/70 (38%) controls (p = 0.02). An increase
in HLA-B46 was also demonstrated. HLA-B46 was present in 16/53 (30%) NPC patients
but was observed in 10/70 (14%) in controls (p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: This study reported two susceptible, HLA-A2 and HLA-B46 antigens,
for NPC in a Thai population.
