Rediscovery of known compounds and time consumed in identification, especially
high molecular weight compounds with complex structure, have let down interest in
drug discovery. In this study, whole-genome analysis of microbe and Global
Natural Products Social (GNPS) molecular networking helped in initial
understanding of possible compounds produced by the microbe. Genome data revealed
10 biosythethic gene clusters that encode for secondary metabolites with
anticancer potential. NMR analysis of the pure compound revealed the presence of 
a four-ringed benz[a]anthracene, thus confirming angucycline; molecular
networking further confirmed production of this class of compounds. The type II
polyketide synthase gene identified in the microbial genome was matched with the 
urdamycin cluster by BLAST analysis. This information led to ease in
identification of urdamycin E and a novel natural derivative, urdamycin V,
purified from Streptomyces sp. OA293. Urdamycin E (Urd E) induced apoptosis and
autophagy in cancer cell lines. Urd E exerted anticancer action through
inactivation of the mTOR complex by preventing phosphorylation at Ser 2448 and
Ser 2481 of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively. Significant reduction in
phosphorylation of the major downstream regulators of both mTORC1 (p70s6k and
4e-bp1) and mTORC2 (Akt) were observed, thus further confirming complete
inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Urd E presents itself as a novel mTOR inhibitor
that employs a novel mechanism in mTOR pathway inhibition.
