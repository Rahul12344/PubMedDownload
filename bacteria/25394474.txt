BACKGROUND: Halitosis is a common problem that affects a large portion of the
population worldwide. The origin of this condition is oral in 90% and systemic in
10% of cases. The unpleasant odor is mainly the result of volatile sulfur
compounds produced by Gram-negative bacteria. However, it has recently been found
that anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria also produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the 
presence of amino acids, such as cysteine. Light, both with and without the use
of chemical agents, has been used to induce therapeutic and antimicrobial
effects. In photodynamic therapy, the antimicrobial effect is confined to areas
covered by photosensitizing dye. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the 
antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy on halitosis in adolescents through 
the analysis of volatile sulfur compounds measured using gas chromatography and
microbiological analysis of coated tongue.
METHODS/DESIGN: A quantitative clinical trial will be carried out involving 60
adolescents randomly divided into the following groups: group 1 will receive
treatment with a tongue scraper, group 2 will receive photodynamic therapy
applied to the posterior two-thirds of the dorsum of the tongue, and group 3 will
receive combined treatment (tongue scraper and photodynamic therapy). Gas
chromatography (OralChromaTM) and microbiological analysis will be used for the
diagnosis of halitosis at the beginning of the study. Post-treatment evaluations 
will be conducted at one hour and 24 hours after treatment. The statistical
analysis will include the Shapiro-Wilk test for the determination of the
distribution of the data. If normal distribution is demonstrated, analysis of
variance followed by Tukey's test will be used to compare groups. The
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test will be used for
data with non-normal distribution. Either the paired t-test or the Wilcoxon test 
will be used to compare data before and after treatment, depending on the
distribution of the data.
DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will determine the efficacy of using
photodynamic therapy alone or in combination with a tongue scraper to treat bad
breath in adolescents.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The protocol for this study was registered with Clinical
Trials (registration number NCT02007993) on 10 December 2013.
