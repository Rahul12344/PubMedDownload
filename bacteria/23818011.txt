Natural killer (NK) cells are key components of the immune system involved in
several immune reactions, including the clearance of intracellular pathogens.
When activated, NK cells rapidly secrete particular cytokines that activate
innate immunity and facilitate development of adaptive responses. Conflicting
reports on the role of NK cells during infection by Listeria monocytogenes can be
found in the literature. Here, we demonstrate that during lethal infection by L. 
monocytogenes, activation of NK cells via the costimulatory molecule CD27 leads
to excessive IFN-γ production. This impairs innate anti-bacterial host defenses
by inducing downregulation of CXCR2 on granulocytes and consequently inhibiting
their recruitment to the sites of infection. The use of antibodies to block CD27 
signaling or to deplete IFN-γ was sufficient to rescue mice from lethal challenge
by L. monocytogenes. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the
importance of CD27 signaling in activation of NK cells and should provide new
ways of interfering with infections.
