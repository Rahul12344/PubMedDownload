Metal ion homeostasis is important for healthy cell function and is regulated by 
metal ion transporters and chaperones. To explore metal ion binding to membrane
transport proteins we have used cadmium-113 as a solid state NMR probe of the
Escherichia coli zinc exporter ZitB present in native membrane preparations.
Competition experiments with other metal ions indicated that nickel and copper
are also able to bind to this protein. Metal ion uptake studies were also
performed using ZitB-reconstituted into proteoliposomes for a well established
fluorescence assay. The results of both the solid state NMR and the uptake
studies demonstrate that ZitB is potentially capable of transporting not only
zinc but also cadmium, nickel and copper. The solid state NMR approach therefore 
offers great potential for defining the substrate spectrum of metal ion
transporter proteins in their native membrane environments. Further, it should be
useful for functional dissection of transporter mechanisms by facilitating the
identification of functional residues by mutational studies.
