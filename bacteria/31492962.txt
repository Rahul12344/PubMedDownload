Cobalamin (vitamin B12) is an essential enzyme cofactor for most branches of
life. Despite the potential importance of this cofactor for soil microbial
communities, the producers and consumers of cobalamin in terrestrial environments
are still unknown. Here we provide the first metagenome-based assessment of soil 
cobalamin-producing bacteria and archaea, quantifying and classifying genes
encoding proteins for cobalamin biosynthesis, transport, remodeling, and
dependency in 155 soil metagenomes with profile hidden Markov models. We also
measured several forms of cobalamin (CN-, Me-, OH-, Ado-B12) and the cobalamin
lower ligand (5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole; DMB) in 40 diverse soil samples.
Metagenomic analysis revealed that less than 10% of soil bacteria and archaea
encode the genetic potential for de novo synthesis of this important enzyme
cofactor. Predominant soil cobalamin producers were associated with the
Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and Thaumarchaeota. In
contrast, a much larger proportion of abundant soil genera lacked cobalamin
synthesis genes and instead were associated with gene sequences encoding
cobalamin transport and cobalamin-dependent enzymes. The enrichment of DMB and
corresponding DMB synthesis genes, relative to corrin ring synthesis genes,
suggests an important role for cobalamin remodelers in terrestrial habitats.
Together, our results indicate that microbial cobalamin production and repair
serve as keystone functions that are significantly correlated with microbial
community size, diversity, and biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems.
