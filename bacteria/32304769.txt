BACKGROUND: Resistance to colistin, the last line therapy for infections caused
by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, represents a major public health
threat. Citrobacter freundii B9-C2 which was isolated from the stool of preterm
neonate on the first week of life, displayed resistance to almost all major
antibiotics, including colistin. Through whole genome sequencing (WGS), we
characterised the genome features that underline the antibiotic-resistance
phenotype of this isolate.
METHODS: Genome of C. freundii B9-C2 was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform.
The assembled genome was annotated and deposited into GenBank under the accession
number CP027849.
RESULTS: Multiple antimicrobial resistance genes including blaCMY-66 were
identified. Further, the presence of 15 antibiotic efflux pump-encoding
resistance genes, including crp, baeR, hns, patA, emrB, msbA, acrA, acrB, emrR,
mdtC, mdtB, mdtG, kdpE, mdfA and msrB, were detected and likely to account for
the observed cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and monobactams
resistance in C. freundii B9-C2. The isolate also presented unique virulence
genes related to biofilm formation, motility and iron uptake. The genome was
compared to publicly available genomes and it was closely related to strains with
environmental origins.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of intestinal 
carriage of colistin-resistant C. freundii from the stool of a neonate in
Malaysia. Using genomic analysis, we have contributed to the understanding of the
potential mechanism of resistance and the phylogenetic relationship of the
isolates with draft genomes available in the public domain.
