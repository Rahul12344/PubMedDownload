C4b-binding protein, a regulatory component of the classical pathway of
complement, is an acute-phase protein and is elevated in systemic lupus
erythematosus.

A radioimmunoassay using monoclonal and polyclonal antihuman C4b-binding protein 
(C4BP) antibody was developed to quantitate C4BP in serum. Using the assay, the
levels of C4BP in healthy individuals, in patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), and in acute-phase individuals were determined. The levels
of C4BP are significantly elevated in individuals with SLE (186%; p = 0.0001) and
are even higher in individuals during the acute phase (286%; p = 0.0001). To
confirm whether or not individuals were in the acute-phase response, serum
C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assessed. In the acute-phase response, CRP
levels were 100-fold elevated over normals, but did not correlate with increases 
in C4BP (r = -0.031; p = 0.899). In SLE patients, the CRP levels were
significantly, but moderately, elevated (5-fold; p = 0.028). The data indicate
that C4BP is an acute-phase reactant and is differentially regulated from CRP
during the acute-phase response.
