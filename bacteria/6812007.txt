Fifty one cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriaemia observed during the last
12 years are reported. Thirty five patients were over fifty years old; 92 p. cent
were admitted for several days and about 50 p. cent were in post-operative
period. A previous antibiotherapy and an impaired status are promotive factors.
The respiratory or peritoneal origins are the most frequent. All patients were
feverish; 24 have had an infectious shock which was inaugural in 12 cases. Seven 
pneumonitis, 3 endocarditis, one pericarditis and 2 osteitis were observed. An
ecthyma gangrenosum was noted in three patients. Mortality was 70 p. cent.
Comparison between recovered and died patients improved bad prognosis of old age,
post operative period, neoplasic, previous organica weakness and pulmonary or
peritoneal origins. Used alone, colimycin has seemed to be more effective than
aminosid antibiotics; but their association with betalactamins was better. An in 
vitro study of the susceptibility of 100 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains has
proved the interest of piperacillin and cefsulodin; azlocillin, cefoperazone and 
ceftriaxone are just less effective.
