Overuse and misuse of antibacterial drugs has resulted in bacteria resistance and
in an increase in mortality rates due to bacterial infections. Therefore, there
is an imperative necessity of new antibacterial drugs. Bio-organometallic
derivatives of antibacterial agents offer an opportunity to discover new active
antibacterial drugs. These compounds are well-characterized products and, in
several examples, their antibacterial activities have been studied. Both
inhibition of the antibacterial activity and strong increase in the antibiotic
activity of the parent drug have been found. The synthesis of the main classes of
bio-organometallic derivatives of these drugs, as well as examples of the use of 
structure-activity relation (SAR) studies to increase the activity and to
understand the mode of action of bio-organometallic antimicrobial peptides
(BOAMPs) and platensimicyn bio-organometallic mimics is presented in this
article.
