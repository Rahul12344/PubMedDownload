YiiP is a dimeric Zn(2+)/H(+) antiporter from Escherichia coli belonging to the
cation diffusion facilitator family. We used cryoelectron microscopy to determine
a 13-Ã… resolution structure of a YiiP homolog from Shewanella oneidensis within a
lipid bilayer in the absence of Zn(2+). Starting from the X-ray structure in the 
presence of Zn(2+), we used molecular dynamics flexible fitting to build a model 
consistent with our map. Comparison of the structures suggests a conformational
change that involves pivoting of a transmembrane, four-helix bundle (M1, M2, M4, 
and M5) relative to the M3-M6 helix pair. Although accessibility of transport
sites in the X-ray model indicates that it represents an outward-facing state,
our model is consistent with an inward-facing state, suggesting that the
conformational change is relevant to the alternating access mechanism for
transport. Molecular dynamics simulation of YiiP in a lipid environment was used 
to address the feasibility of this conformational change. Association of the
C-terminal domains is the same in both states, and we speculate that this
association is responsible for stabilizing the dimer that, in turn, may
coordinate the rearrangement of the transmembrane helices.
