This study examined, in human cancer lines, the pattern of cytokine production
stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of outer surface of
gram-negative bacteria, and characterized the expression pattern of CD14, cell
surface LPS receptor antigen, and toll-like receptors (TLRs), which appear to be 
key regulators of the innate immune response system. Two colon cancer cell lines 
(DLD and LoVo), a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line and a myelomonocytic cell
line were incubated with LPS for 0-72 h, and transforming growth factor (TGF)
beta1 and beta2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukins 6, 8 and 15 were
assayed. The only changes induced by incubation with LPS were significant
increases in TGFbeta1 production at 12 h, and in HGF production at 72 h, in
LPS-stimulated DLD cells, and significant increases in TGFbeta2 production after 
12 h and in HGF after 72 h in LoVo cells. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase 
chain reaction analysis, expression of CD14 and TLR-2 mRNA was detected in DLD
and LoVo cells, and expression of TLR-4 mRNA was detected in PLC/PRF/5 and KG-1
cells. These results suggest that LPS induces TGFbeta and HGF production mediated
by CD14/TLR-2 in cultured human colon cancer cell lines.
