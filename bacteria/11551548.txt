The primary structure of syringicin (syr), a new acidic alpha-elicitin, isolated 
from culture filtrates of Phytophthora syringae, causal agent of citrus fruit
rot, has been determined using a combined approch based on Edman degradation and 
MALDI-MS (TTCTT TQQTA AYVAL VSILS DSSFN QCATD SGYSM LTATA LPTTA QYKLM CASTA CKTMI
TKIVS LNAPD CELTV PTSGL VLNVY SYANG FSSTC ASL). Syr has 98 amino acids with a
M(r) of 10194.6+/-0.2, which was determined by electrospray ionisation-mass
spectrometry (ES-MS) and in agreement with three disulphide bridges, located
between Cys3-Cys71, Cys27-Cys56 and Cys51-Cys95. Syr induces a hypersensitive
response and electrolyte leakage in tobacco. These are characteristic elicitor
properties of the group and in agreement with the molecular mechanism recently
proposed for this kind of protein. Finally, its possible applications in
biological agriculture and biomedicine are briefly discussed.
