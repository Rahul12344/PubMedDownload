RATIONALE: Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of T cells
that recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1d molecules. Recent studies have
shown that iNKT cells can protect mice against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
infection. We sought to determine whether pharmacological activation of iNKT
cells by α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) could be used to treat tuberculosis
(TB).
OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that α-GalCer, either alone or in combination with
isoniazid, could be used to treat pulmonary TB.
METHODS: The ability of α-GalCer-activated iNKT cells to suppress Mtb replication
was evaluated using an in vitro coculture system. To test its potency in vivo,
mice infected with virulent Mtb were treated with α-GalCer alone or in
combination with isoniazid.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Quantitative colony-forming unit counts were
compared for both experimental systems. Our results show that α-GalCer plus
isoniazid controls bacterial growth better than α-GalCer or INH alone, and single
or multiple α-GalCer administrations prolong the survival of the mice infected
via the aerosol route.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that α-GalCer administration can improve the
outcome of Mtb infection, even when transmitted by the aerosol route. However, a 
combination of isoniazid and α-GalCer treatment has a synergistic effect on
infection control. We conclude that more efficient treatment of TB will be
achieved through a combination of classic chemotherapy and modulation of the host
immune response.
