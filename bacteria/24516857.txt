Three-dimensional structure of thermostable lipase is much sought after nowadays 
as it is important for industrial application mainly found in the food,
detergent, and pharmaceutical sectors. Crystallization utilizing the counter
diffusion method in space was performed with the aim to obtain high resolution
diffracting crystals with better internal order to improve the accuracy of the
structure. Thermostable T1 lipase enzyme has been crystallized in laboratory on
earth and also under microgravity condition aboard Progress spacecraft to the ISS
in collaboration with JAXA (Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency). This study is
conducted with the aims of improving crystal packing and structure resolution.
The diffraction data set for ground grown crystal was collected to 1.3 Å
resolution and belonged to monoclinic C2 space group with unit cell parameters a 
= 117.40 Å, b = 80.95 Å, and c = 99.81 Å, whereas the diffraction data set for
space grown crystal was collected to 1.1 Å resolution and belonged to monoclinic 
C2 space group with unit cell parameters a = 117.31 Å, b = 80.85 Å, and c = 99.81
Å. The major difference between the two crystal growth systems is the lack of
convection and sedimentation in microgravity environment resulted in the growth
of much higher quality crystals of T1 lipase.
