Arthritis in a genetically susceptible SKG strain of mice models a theoretical
paradigm wherein autoimmune arthritis arises because of interplay between
preexisting autoreactive T cells and environmental stimuli. SKG mice have a point
mutation in ZAP-70 that results in attenuated TCR signaling, altered thymic
selection, and spontaneous production of autoreactive T cells that cause
arthritis following exposure to microbial β-glucans. In this study, we identify
Nod2, an innate immune receptor, as a critical suppressor of arthritis in SKG
mice. SKG mice deficient in Nod2 (Nod2-/-SKG) developed a dramatically
exacerbated form of arthritis, which was independent of sex and microbiota, but
required the skg mutation in T cells. Worsened arthritis in Nod2-/-SKG mice was
accompanied by expansion of Th17 cells, which to some measure coproduced TNF,
GM-CSF, and IL-22, along with elevated IL-17A levels within joint synovial fluid.
Importantly, neutralization of IL-17A mitigated arthritis in Nod2-/-SKG mice,
indicating that Nod2-mediated protection occurs through suppression of the Th17
response. Nod2 deficiency did not alter regulatory T cell development or
function. Instead, Nod2 deficiency resulted in an enhanced fundamental ability of
SKG CD4+ T cells (from naive mice) to produce increased levels of IL-17 and to
passively transfer arthritis to lymphopenic recipients on a single-cell level.
These data reveal a previously unconsidered role for T cell-intrinsic Nod2 as an 
endogenous negative regulator of Th17 responses and arthritogenic T cells. Based 
on our findings, future studies aimed at understanding a negative regulatory
function of Nod2 within autoreactive T cells could provide novel therapeutic
strategies for treatment of patients with arthritis.
