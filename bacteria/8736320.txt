In this study we tested the capacity of ultraviolet B (UVB)-irradiated major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ keratinocytes, monocytes and dendritic
cells to activate T cells in the presence of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B. We
demonstrated that UVB irradiation of MHC class II+ keratinocytes does not change 
their capacity to activate T cells in the presence of Staphylococcus enterotoxin 
B. In contrast, UVB irradiation of antigen-presenting cells decreases their
capacity to activate T cells. This differential capacity to activate T cells
after UVB irradiation was not due to factors released from UVB-irradiated cells. 
The interferon-gamma induced upregulation of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion
molecule-1 on keratinocytes does not seem to be the only explanation, since UVB
irradiation decreased the accessory cell function of interferon-gamma pretreated 
monocytes. Differential requirements for and UVB regulation of costimulatory
molecules may be involved, since blocking of the B7/CD28 pathway affects the
capacity of dendritic cells but not keratinocytes to activate T cells in the
presence of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B. Thus, MHC class II+ keratinocytes in
the presence of superantigens released from staphylococci may activate T cells
and maintain inflammation despite UVB treatment.
