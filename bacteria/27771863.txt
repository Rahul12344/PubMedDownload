HLTF is a SWI2/SNF2-family ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzyme that acts in
the error-free branch of DNA damage tolerance (DDT), a cellular mechanism that
enables replication of damaged DNA while leaving damage repair for a later time. 
Human HLTF and a closely related protein SHPRH, as well as their yeast homologue 
Rad5, are multi-functional enzymes that share E3 ubiquitin-ligase activity
required for activation of the error-free DDT. HLTF and Rad5 also function as
ATP-dependent dsDNA translocases and possess replication fork reversal
activities. Thus, they can convert Y-shaped replication forks into X-shaped
Holliday junction structures that allow error-free replication over DNA lesions. 
The fork reversal activity of HLTF is dependent on 3'-ssDNA-end binding activity 
of its N-terminal HIRAN domain. Here we present the solution NMR structure of the
human HLTF HIRAN domain, an OB-like fold module found in organisms from bacteria 
(as a stand-alone domain) to plants, fungi and metazoan (in combination with
SWI2/SNF2 helicase-like domain). The obtained structure of free HLTF HIRAN is
similar to recently reported structures of its DNA bound form, while the NMR
analysis also reveals that the DNA binding site of the free domain exhibits
conformational heterogeneity. Sequence comparison of N-terminal regions of HLTF, 
SHPRH and Rad5 aided by knowledge of the HLTF HIRAN structure suggests that the
SHPRH N-terminus also includes an uncharacterized structured module, exhibiting
weak sequence similarity with HIRAN regions of HLTF and Rad5, and potentially
playing a similar functional role.
