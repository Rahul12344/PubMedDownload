Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are the components of fossil flue gas that give rise to the
greatest environmental concerns. This study evaluated the ability of the green
algae Chlorella to acclimate to high level of NOx and the potential utilization
of Chlorella strains in biological NOx removal (DeNOx) from industrial flue
gases. Fifteen Chlorella strains were subject to high-level of nitrite (HN, 176.5
mmolL(-1) nitrite) to simulate exposure to high NOx. These strains were
subsequently divided into four groups with respect to their ability to tolerate
nitrite (excellent, good, fair, and poor). One strain from each group was
selected to evaluate their photosynthetic response to HN condition, and the
nitrite adaptability of the four Chlorella strains were further identified by
using chlorophyll fluorescence. The outcome of our experiments shows that,
although high concentrations of nitrite overall negatively affect growth and
photosynthesis of Chlorella strains, the degree of nitrite tolerance is a
strain-specific feature. Some Chlorella strains have an appreciably higher
ability to acclimate to high-level of nitrite. Acclimation is achieved through a 
three-step process of restrict, acclimate, and thriving. Notably, Chlorella sp.
C2 was found to have a high tolerance and to rapidly acclimate to high
concentrations of nitrite; it is therefore a promising candidate for
microalgae-based biological NOx removal.
