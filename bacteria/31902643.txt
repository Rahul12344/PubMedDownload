Simultaneous cognate epitope recognition by bovine CD4 and CD8 T cells is
essential for primary expansion of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cells following
ex vivo stimulation with a candidate Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 
peptide vaccine.

Studies in cattle show CD8 cytotoxic T cells (CTL), with the ability to kill
intracellular bacteria, develop following stimulation of monocyte-depleted
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (mdPBMC) with antigen presenting cells (APC,
i.e. conventional dendritic cells [cDC] and monocyte-derived DC [MoDC]) pulsed
with MMP, a membrane protein from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
(Map) encoded by MAP2121c. CTL activity was diminished if CD4 T cells were
depleted from mdPBMC before antigen (Ag) presentation by APC, suggesting
simultaneous cognate recognition of MMP epitopes presented by MHC I and MHC II
molecules to CD4 and CD8 T cells is essential for development of CTL activity. To
explore this possibility, studies were conducted with mdPBMC cultures in the
presence of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for MHC class I and MHC class
II molecules. The CTL response of mdPBMC to MMP-pulsed APC was completely blocked
in the presence of mAbs to both MHC I and II molecules and also blocked in the
presence of mAbs to either MHC I or MHC II alone. The results demonstrate
simultaneous cognate recognition of Ag by CD4 and CD8 T cells is essential for
delivery of CD4 T cell help to CD8 T cells to elicit development of CTL.
