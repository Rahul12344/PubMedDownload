Snail is a C2H2-type zinc finger transcriptional repressor that induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition by repression of E-cadherin expression levels
during embryonic development and tumour progression. Snail is imported into the
nucleus by importin β through direct binding with its four zinc finger domain.
The complex between importin β and Snail four zinc finger domain was crystallized
in order to understand the nuclear transport mechanism of Snail. The constituents
of the complex were separately expressed and were then co-purified and
crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belonged
to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 228.2, b = 77.5, c = 72.0 Å, β =
100.9° and diffracted to 2.5 Å resolution.
