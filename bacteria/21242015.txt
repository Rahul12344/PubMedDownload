The receptor tyrosine kinase Met plays a pivotal role in vertebrate development
and tissue regeneration, its deregulation contributes to cancer. Met is also
targeted during the infection by the facultative intracellular bacterium Listeria
monocytogenes. The mechanistic basis for Met activation by its natural ligand
hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is only beginning to be
understood at a structural level. Crystal structures of Met in complex with L.
monocytogenes InlB suggest that Met dimerization by this bacterial invasion
protein is mediated by a dimer contact of the ligand. Here, I review the
structural basis of Met activation by InlB and highlight parallels and
differences to the physiological Met ligand HGF/SF and its splice variant NK1.
