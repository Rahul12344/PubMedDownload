The IL-17/IL-17 receptor family is the newest and least understood of the
cytokine subclasses. Composed of ligands IL-17A-IL-17F and receptors
IL-17RA-IL-17RE, these cytokines have many unique structural and functional
features. Since the discovery of the 'Th17' subset in 2005, particular attention 
has been paid to IL-17A and IL-17F and their cognate receptors. To date, far less
is known about the rest of the family. This review discusses recent advances in
the field, with an emphasis on IL-17A biology.
