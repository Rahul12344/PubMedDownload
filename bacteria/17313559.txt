In a previous study, we determined the gene expression profile of both
megakaryocytic and non-megakaryocytic lineage cells via serial analysis of gene
expression and microarray methods, and demonstrated that Pim-1 was expressed more
abundantly in megakaryocytic lineage cells. In this study, we knocked down Pim-1 
in K562 cells, as well as in CD34+ cells from cord blood, via RNA interference,
in order to analyze the effects of Pim-1 expression on the megakaryocytic
differentiation of these cells. We then additionally overexpressed the Pim-1
genes in K562 cells, and conducted a comparison of these effects with those of
RNAi cells on the course of megakaryocytic differentiation. The results of this
study revealed that Pim-1 knockdown exerted no effects on commitment or
differentiation toward megakaryocytic lineage, as evidenced by the detected CD41+
or CD61+ cells, or on the number of megakaryocytic colony forming units. However,
Pim-1 knockdown was found to elicit a reduction in CD41+ cells with >4n DNA
content, and a concomitant increase in the fraction of cells achieving a ploidy
of >4n in the Pim-1 overexpressing population of K562 cells. Collectively, the
findings of these studies indicate that the expression of Pim-1 expression is
both necessary and sufficient for polyploidization, but is not critical to
cytoplasmic differentiation on megakaryopoiesis.
