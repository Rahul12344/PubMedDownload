Cytochrome P450 (P450) 27C1 is one of the "orphan" P450 enzymes without a known
biological function. A human P450 27C1 cDNA with a nucleotide sequence modified
for Escherichia coli usage was prepared and modified at the N-terminus, based on 
the expected mitochondrial localization. A derivative with residues 3-60 deleted 
was expressed at a level of 1350nmol/L E. coli culture and had the characteristic
P450 spectra. The identity of the expressed protein was confirmed by mass
spectrometry of proteolytic fragments. The purified P450 was in the low-spin iron
state, and the spin equilibrium was not perturbed by any of the potential
substrates vitamin D(3), 1alpha- or 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3), or cholesterol.
P450s 27A1 and 27B1 are known to catalyze the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D(3)
and the 1alpha-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxy vitamin D(3), respectively. In the
presence of recombinant human adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase, recombinant 
P450 27C1 did not catalyze the oxidation of vitamin D(3), 1alpha- or 25-hydroxy
vitamin D(3), or cholesterol at detectable rates. P450 27C1 mRNA was determined
to be expressed in liver, kidney, pancreas, and several other human tissues.
