OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to investigate effects of coinfection of
Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) or Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
(A. actinomycetemcomitans) with Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) on their
adhering and invasive capacity to human gingival epithelial cells as well as the 
expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) in human
gingival epithelial cells.
DESIGN: P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were tested for their ability 
to attach and invade a human gingival epithelial cell line (Ca9-22) alone or
coinfecting with F. nucleatum. Also, expression levels of IL-8 and hBD-2 were
detected respectively using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) when Ca9-22 cells were infected with
P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans alone or coinfecting with F.
nucleatum.
RESULTS: F. nucleatum, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were allowed to
adhere and invade Ca9-22 cells, either each strain alone or under coinfection.
The adhering and invasive abilities of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans
were significantly greater when they were coincubated with F. nucleatum (P<0.05) 
than either of them alone. These enhancements were inhibited by galactose. In
addition, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans inhibited the activation of 
IL-8 and hBD-2 by F. nucleatum. Also, galactose disrupted this inhibition on the 
expression of IL-8 and hBD-2.
CONCLUSION: These results suggested coinfection with F. nucleatum can enhance
adhesion and invasion of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans to Ca9-22
cells, as well as inhibition on host innate immune response.
