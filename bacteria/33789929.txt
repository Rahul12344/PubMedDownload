NKT cells are primed lymphocytes that rapidly secrete cytokines and can directly 
kill cancerous cells. Given the critical role NKT cells play in cancer immune
surveillance, we sought to investigate the effect of mutations in Brca1,
specifically a conditional deletion of exon 11, on type I invariant NKT cell
development. We observed a significant reduction in invariant NKT cells in both
primary lymphoid and peripheral organs in Brca1 mutant mice compared with
wild-type C57BL/6. However, the original Brca1 mutant strain was on a mixed
background containing FVB/N. We determined that strain differences, rather than
mutations in Brca1, led to the observed loss in NKT cells. Importantly, we found 
that whereas FVB/N mice lack Vβ8, there was a striking increase in the total
number of thymic type I CD1d-α-galactosylceramide tetramer positive NKT cells and
skewing of the NKT cell population to NKT2 compared with C57BL/6 mice.
Collectively, our data demonstrate the profound effect genetics can have on NKT
cell subset differentiation.
