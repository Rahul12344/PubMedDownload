AIM: To evaluate the expression of eNOS and CD34 in gastric mucosa of
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) positive diabetic patients, in correlation with
glycaemic control and diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN).
METHODS: We prospectively studied 49 diabetic type 2 patients (29 women, mean age
65.32+/-8.56 years) and 30 control subjects (15 women, mean age 58.47+/-12.40)
that underwent endoscopy. Biopsies from the body and antrum were evaluated for H.
pylori-gastritis, eNOS and angiogenic marker CD34 expression. Statistical
analysis in correlation with mean glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of the last 3 
years, and DAN was performed.
RESULTS: The two groups were matched for age (p=0.144), sex (p=0.335), H.
pylori-infection (p=0.617) and degree of gastritis (p=0.78). eNOS and CD34
attenuated expression correlated with diabetes mellitus (DM) in the corpus
(p=0.009 and 0.02, respectively). eNOS and CD34 expression was upregulated in H. 
pylori-positive controls but not in H. pylori-positive diabetic patients (p=0.010
and 0.007 for the corpus and p=0.036 and 0.047 for the antrum, respectively).
eNOS expression correlated with good glycaemic control (GGC) in the gastric
corpus (p<0.001) and antrum (p=0.0037) and with absence of DAN (p=0.009 and
0.036, respectively for the corpus and antrum).
CONCLUSION: Chronic glycaemic control affects eNOS expression and angiogenesis in
the gastric mucosa of patients with type 2 DM. eNOS expression is not upregulated
in H. pylori-positive diabetic patients.
