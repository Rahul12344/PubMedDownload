In vitro breakage of plasmid DNA by mutagens and pesticides.

Griffin DE 3rd, Hill WE.

Covalently closed circular molecules of the colicinogenic plasmid E1 can serve as
sensitive indicators for detecting in vitro breakage of DNA. After these
molecules are radioactively labeled and purified by cesium chloride
density-gradient centrifugation, they are incubated with the compounds to be
tested. Samples are analyzed on alkaline sucrose gradients to determine the
fraction of unbroken molecules and a breakage rate is calculated. Positive
results were obtained for all three mutagenic alkylating agents (MMS, EMS, and
MNNG) and of the 11 pesticides tested, dexon, dichlorvos, malathion, and methyl
parathion induced breaks in molecules at a rate significantly greater than the
controls.
