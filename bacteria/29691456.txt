Concrete is a strong and fairly inexpensive building substance, but has several
disadvantages like cracking that allows corrosion, thus reducing its lifespan. To
mitigate these complications, long-lasting microbial self-healing cement is an
alternative that is eco-friendly and also actively repairs cracks. The present
paper describes the detailed experimental investigation on compressive strength
of cement mortars, mixed with six alkaliphilic bacteria, isolated from subsurface
mica mines of high alkalinity. The experiments showed that the addition of
alkaliphilic isolates at different cell concentrations (104 and 106 cells/ml)
enhanced the compressive strength of cement mortar, because the rapid growth of
bacteria at high alkalinity precipitates calcite crystals that lead to filling of
pores and densifying the concrete mix. Thus, Bacillus subtilis (SVUNM4) showed
the highest compressive strength (28.61%) of cement mortar at 104 cells/ml
compared to those of other five alkaliphilic isolates (Brevibacillus sp.,
SVUNM15-22.1%; P. dendritiformis, SVUNM11-19.9%; B. methylotrophicus, SVUNM9-16%;
B. licheniformis, SVUNM14-12.7% and S. maltophilia, SVUNM13-9.6%) and controlled 
cement mortar as well. This method resulted in the filling of cracks in concrete 
with calcite (CaCO3), which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Our results showed that the alkaliphilic bacterial isolates used in the study are
effective in self-healing and repair of concrete cracks.
