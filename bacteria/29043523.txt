The microbiological contamination of retrieved tissues has become a very
important topic and it is a critical aspect in the safety of allografts,
especially from multi-tissue donors whose tissues are frequently contaminated as 
a consequence of retrieval. We analysed a total of 10,107 tissues, 8178
musculoskeletal and 1929 cardiovascular tissues, retrieved from 978 multi-tissue 
donors. Of these, 159 heart-beating donors (HBD) were also organ donors, while
the remaining 819 non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) were tissue donors only. A
multivariate logistic model was used to determine the factors affecting
contamination risk during retrieval. In the model, the dependent variable was the
presence/absence of contamination while the covariates included were: gender,
type of donor, age of donor, cause of death, previous skin donation, cadaver
time, number of people attending the retrieval, number of tissues retrieved.
Moreover, a second log-linear model was used to determine the number of strains
isolated per tissue. Tissue contamination was statistically correlated with
gender, type of donor, cadaver time, number of people attending the retrieval and
season. In conclusion, to minimize the risk of bacterial contamination, aseptic
techniques should be used at retrieval, with the number of retrieval team members
kept to a minimum. In addition, cadaver time should be as short as possible and
the donor should be refrigerated within a few hours after death.
