BACKGROUND, AIMS: The aim of our study was to investigate the patterns of several
metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2 and MT1-MMP) mRNAs expression using a
semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and to
correlate them with clinical parameters and bacteriological diagnosis in healthy 
versus diseased human gingiva.
METHODS: To identify the cell origin of MMP production, in situ hybridization
(ISH) was also performed for the MMPs on the same samples. 17 gingival biopsies
were collected (13 affected by advanced periodontitis and 4 healthy used as
controls) and plaque index, gingival index, pocket depth and bleeding on probing 
were measured. Subgingival microbial samples were also collected to be analysed
by a DNA probe technique. The biopsies were processed both for RT-PCR and ISH. We
also investigated a model for bacterial induced MMP expression in human gingival 
fibroblasts (HGF) infected by Eikenella corrodens.
RESULTS: We found an expression of the mRNA encoding MMP-1 only in diseased
gingiva but at low levels relative to beta-actin (mean+/-SD: diseased versus
healthy: 0.013+/-0.024 versus 0). Although the frequencies and levels of mRNA
encoding for MMP-2 or MT1-MMP are not significantly different between each group 
(mean+/-SD: 0.329+/-0.344 versus 0.137+/-0.219 for MMP-2; 0.485+/-0.374 versus
0.466+/-0.296 for MT1-MMP), using ISH, we observed an expression of both mRNAs in
fibroblasts of pathological specimens at sites that histologically showed signs
of chronic inflammation and connective tissue remodelling. In vitro infection of 
HGF by Eikenella corrodens stimulated 3-fold the production of the mRNA encoding 
MMP-2 while other mRNAs remained unchanged.
CONCLUSION: Our results did not reveal significant differences in the expression 
of mRNAs encoding for the MMPs between healthy and periodontitis-affected
patients, reflecting the great heterogeneity in the periodontal status of
individuals. However, they indicate that gingival fibroblasts are an active
source of MMP-2 production in response to a periopathogen.
