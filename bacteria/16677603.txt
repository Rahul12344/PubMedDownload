Small interfering RNA (siRNA) expression vectors using a Pol III promoter fall
into two categories, vectors with a single Pol III promoter that express small
hairpin RNA (shRNA) and vectors with two head-to-head (convergent) Pol III
promoters that express siRNA. There are technical difficulties in preparing
convergent siRNA vectors from cDNA. Here, we report construction of a novel
convergent siRNA expression vector, pTHUB. Two XcmI sites were inserted between
opposing Pol III promoters. After linearization with XcmI, pTHUB has a single 3' 
A overhang at each end that allows direct cloning of partially DNase I digested
cDNA fragments (20-30 bp) tailed with ddT. A derivative method for generating 19 
bp siRNA in pTHUB is also described. The suppression efficiency of the pTHUB
vector is comparable to those of conventional shRNA vectors. We have made a siRNA
library from a single cDNA. The same approach can be used to construct
whole-genome siRNA libraries from cellular cDNA.
