We have previously demonstrated that prion protein-deficient (Prnp(0/0)) Zürich I
mice display impaired T zone structure resulting from decreased splenic
expression of the T cell homing chemokines, CCL19 and CCL21. Prions are
transported to, and colonise in, the secondary lymphoid tissues. Therefore, in
order to investigate how scrapie infection affects the splenic white pulp
structure, we infected C57BL/6 mice with the mouse-adapted scrapie strain ME7 and
analysed end-stage prion disease. We found that the white pulp regions of
ME7-infected spleens were smaller, and contained markedly diminished T zones, as 
compared to control spleens. Although lymphoid tissue inducer cells were not
affected, the expression of both CCL19 and CCL21 was decreased. In addition, the 
networks of follicular dendritic cells, which are known to express high levels of
the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) and to accumulate PrP(Sc) following scrapie
infection, were larger in ME7-infected spleens. Further, they were associated
with increased numbers of B cells expressing high levels of IgM. These data
indicate that ME7-infected spleens display phenotype characteristics different
from those reported for Prnp(0/0) spleens mainly due to the gain of PrP(Sc)
function and suggest that the PrP(C) is required, not only to form the splenic
white pulp structure, but also to maintain the intact T zone structure.
