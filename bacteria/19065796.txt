CD4+ T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases are initiated and maintained by the
presentation of self-antigen by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to self-reactive 
CD4+ T-cells. According to the two-signal hypothesis, activation of a naive
antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell requires stimulation of both the T-cell antigen
receptor (signal 1) and costimulatory molecules such as CD28 (signal 2). To date,
the majority of therapies for autoimmune diseases approved by the Food and Drug
Administration primarily focus on the global inhibition of immune inflammatory
activity. The goal of ongoing research in this field is to develop
antigen-specific treatments which block the deleterious effects of self-reactive 
immune cell function while maintaining the ability of the immune system to clear 
nonself antigens. To this end, the signaling pathways involved in the induction
of CD4+ T-cell anergy, as apposed to activation, are a topic of intense interest.
This chapter discusses components of the CD4+ T-cell activation pathway that may 
serve as therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease.
