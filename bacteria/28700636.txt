Conventional high-dose chemotherapy frequently leads to severe neutropenia,
during which patients experience a high risk of infection. Although support care 
with donor's neutrophils is possible this choice is largely hampered by the
limited availability of matched donors. To overcome this problem, we explored a
large-scale ex vivo production of neutrophils from hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) using a four-stage culture approach in a roller-bottle production
platform. We expanded CD34+ HSCs isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB) using
our in-house special medium supplemented with cytokine cocktails and achieved
about 49000-fold expansion of cells, among which about 61% were differentiated
mature neutrophils. Ex vivo differentiated neutrophils exhibited a chemotactic
activity similar to those from healthy donors and were capable of killing E. coli
in vitro. The expansion yield as reported herein was at least 5 times higher than
any other methods reported in the literature. Moreover, the cost of our modified 
medium was only a small fraction (<1/60) of the StemSpanâ„¢ SFEM. Therefore, our ex
vivo expansion platform, coupled with a low cost of stem cell culture due to the 
use of a modified medium, makes large-scale manufacturing neutrophils possible,
which should be able to greatly ameliorate neutrophil shortage for transfusion in
the clinic.
