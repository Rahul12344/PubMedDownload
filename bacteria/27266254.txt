[Antibacterial Activity of Alkylated and Acylated Derivatives of Low-Molecular
Weight Chitosan].

[Article in Russian]

Shagdarova BTs, Il'ina AV, Varlamov VP.

A number of alkylated (quaternized) and acylated derivatives of low-molecular
weight chitosan were obtained. The structure and composition of the compounds
were confirmed by the results of IR and PMR spectroscopy, as well as
conductometric titration. The effect of the acyl substituent and the degree of
substitution of N-(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium) with the propyl fragment
appended to amino groups of the C2 atom of polymer chains on antibacterial
activity against typical representatives of gram-positive and gram-negative
microorganisms (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli) was studied. The
highest activity was in the case of
N-[(2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium)propyl]chitosan chloride with the maximal
substitution (98%). The minimal inhibitory concentration of the derivative was
0.48 µg/mL and 3.90 µg/mL for S. epidermis and E. coli, respectively.
