BACKGROUND: Autophagy plays a crucial role in controlling various biological
responses including starvation, homeostatic turnover of long-lived proteins, and 
invasion of bacteria. However, a role for autophagy in development and/or
function of mast cells is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate a role for autophagy in mast cells, we generated bone
marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) from mice lacking autophagy related gene (Atg) 
7, an essential enzyme for autophagy induction.
METHODS: Bone marrow-derived mast cells were generated from bone marrow cells of 
control and IFN-inducible Atg7-deficient mice, and morphologic and functional
analyses were performed.
RESULTS: We found that conversion of type I to type II light chain (LC3)-II, a
hallmark of autophagy, was constitutively induced in mast cells under full
nutrient conditions, and LC3-II localized in secretory granules of mast cells.
Although deletion of Atg7 did not impair the development of BMMCs, Atg7(-/-)
BMMCs showed severe impairment of degranulation, but not cytokine production on
FcεRI cross-linking. Intriguingly, LC3-II but not LC3-I was co-localized with
CD63, a secretory lysosomal marker, and was released extracellularly along with
degranulation in Atg7(+/+) but not Atg7(-/-) BMMCs. Moreover, passive cutaneous
anaphylaxis reactions were severely impaired in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/W(V)
mice reconstituted with Atg7(-/-) BMMCs compared with Atg7(+/+) BMMCs.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that autophagy is not essential for the
development but plays a crucial role in degranulation of mast cells. Thus,
autophagy might be a potential target to treat allergic diseases in which mast
cells are critically involved.
