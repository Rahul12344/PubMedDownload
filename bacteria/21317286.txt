BAD (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death) belongs to the proapoptotic BH3-only
subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins. Physiological activity of BAD is highly controlled
by phosphorylation. To further analyze the regulation of BAD function, we
investigated the role of recently identified phosphorylation sites on
BAD-mediated apoptosis. We found that in contrast to the N-terminal
phosphorylation sites, the serines 124 and 134 act in an antiapoptotic manner
because the replacement by alanine led to enhanced cell death. Our results
further indicate that RAF kinases represent, besides PAK1, BAD serine 134
phosphorylating kinases. Importantly, in the presence of wild type BAD,
co-expression of survival kinases, such as RAF and PAK1, leads to a strongly
increased proliferation, whereas substitution of serine 134 by alanine abolishes 
this process. Furthermore, we identified BAD serine 134 to be strongly involved
in survival signaling of B-RAF-V600E-containing tumor cells and found that
phosphorylation of BAD at this residue is critical for efficient proliferation in
these cells. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the regulation 
of BAD function by phosphorylation and its role in cancer signaling.
