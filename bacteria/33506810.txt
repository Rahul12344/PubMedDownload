BACKGROUND: Antiviral and immune-modulating properties of low-molecular-weight
heparin (LMWH) against Coronaviridae have been reported by in vitro studies, but 
no in vivo evidence is yet available. We sought to know whether the timing of
prophylactic doses of LMWH during the course of COVID-19 may affect the time to
SARS-CoV-2 nasal-oropharyngeal swab negativization.
METHODS: Retrospective monocentric cross-sectional study on patients requiring
sub-intensive ward admission due to first SARS-CoV-2 infection and undergoing
early (EH; within 7 days from COVID-19 signs and symptoms onset) versus delayed
prophylactic LMWH (DH; after 7 days). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was measured by reverse
transcription real-time PCR according to scheduled time points: first swab after 
2 weeks from COVID-19 onset, then at 1-week intervals until negativity.
RESULTS: Time to SARS-CoV-2 swab negativity was shorter in EH (38 patients)
compared with DH (55 patients): 22 versus 37 days (P=0.004). The number of
confirmative negative swabs in EH was significantly higher compared with DH at
week 2 (21.1% versus 3.6%; P=0.017) and 4 (60.0% versus 19.6%; P<0.001). At
univariate, EH differed from DH for several disease severity and clinical
management parameters. Nevertheless, after accounting for the differences, Cox
regression showed early LMWH administration (hazard ratio [HR] 2.91 [1.51, 5.63];
P=0.002) and higher lymphocytes nadir (HR 1.04 [1.01, 1.08]; P=0.020) as
predictors of shorter time to swab negativity.
CONCLUSIONS: This potential antiviral and/or immune-modulating activity of LMWH
needs further in vivo confirmations by randomized controlled trials.
