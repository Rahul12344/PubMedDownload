The design of novel nucleoside analogues bearing a C2' all-carbon quaternary
center is described. The construction of this all-carbon stereogenic center
involves the use of photoredox catalysis to initiate an intramolecular attack of 
a silyl-tethered vinyl functionality on a tertiary radical. Density functional
theory calculations were performed to explore the origin of the high syn
diastereoselectivity obtained through the preferred 5-exo-trig cyclization mode. 
The intramolecular vinyl addition also enables the preparation of the
complementary configuration of the C2' all-carbon stereocenter when performed
after lactonization.
