The identification of novel cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes is important to
analysis of the involvement of CD8(+) T cells in Mycobacterium tuberculosis
infection as well as to the development of peptide vaccines. In this study, a
novel CTL epitope from region of difference 11 encoded antigen Rv3425 was
identified. Epitopes were predicted by the reversal immunology approach.
Rv3425-p118 (LIASNVAGV) was identified as having relatively strong binding
affinity and stability towards the HLA-A*0201 molecule. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells pulsed by this peptide were able to release interferon-γ in
healthy donors (HLA-A*02(+) purified protein derivative(+)). In cytotoxicity
assays in vitro and in vivo, Rv3425-p118 induced CTLs to specifically lyse the
target cells. Therefore, this epitope could provide a subunit component for
designing vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
