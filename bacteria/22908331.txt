The interaction of CD28, which is constitutively expressed on T cells, with
B7.1/B7.2 expressed on APCs is critical for T cell activation. CD28 is also
expressed on murine and human plasma cells but its function on these cells
remains unclear. There are two types of plasma cells: short-lived ones that
appear in the secondary lymphoid tissue shortly after Ag exposure, and long-lived
plasma cells that mainly reside in the bone marrow. We demonstrate that
CD28-deficient murine short- and long-lived plasma cells produce significantly
higher levels of Abs than do their wild-type counterparts. This was owing to both
increased frequencies of plasma cells as well as increased Ab production per
plasma cell. Plasma cells also express the ligand for CD28, B7.1, and B7.2.
Surprisingly, deficiency of B7.1 and B7.2 in B cells also led to higher Ab
levels, analogous to Cd28(-/-) plasma cells. Collectively, our results suggest
that the CD28-B7 interaction operates as a key modulator of plasma cell function.
