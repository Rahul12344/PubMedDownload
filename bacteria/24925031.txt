In this review, we will discuss the recent advances in understanding the
pancreatic cancer stem cells. Identification and characterization of pancreatic
cancer stem cells may aid our ability to improve diagnosis and treatment of
pancreatic cancer. Novel approaches are necessary for the earlier diagnosis of
pancreatic cancer as well as improved treatment to prevent distal metastasis. Key
markers for the identification of pancreatic cancer stem cells include CD133,
ALDH, side population cells and the triplet combination CD44+ CD24+ESA+. The
roles of these proteins as markers for stemness in pancreatic cancer as well as
recent studies with the c-Met proto-oncogene will be discussed. The ability of
these markers to predict survival of pancreatic cancer patients is being examined
clinically. Stemness and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be
linked. Expression of some of these markers may be associated with distant
metastasis. Treatment of pancreatic cancer patients by targeting the pancreatic
cancer stem cells holds promise.
