Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase is an essential enzyme which acts as one of the rescue
factors of the stalled ribosomes. It is an esterase that hydrolyzes the ester
bond in the peptidyl-tRNA molecules, which are products of ribosome stalling.
This enzyme is required for rapid clearing of the peptidyl-tRNAs, the
accumulation of which in the cell leads to cell death. Over the recent years, it 
has been heralded as an attractive drug target for antimicrobial therapeutics.
Two distinct classes of peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase, Pth and Pth2, have been
identified in nature. This review gives an overview of the structural and
functional aspects of Pth, along with its sequence and structural comparison
among various species of bacteria. While the mode of binding of the substrate to 
Pth and the mechanism of hydrolysis are still speculated upon, the
structure-based drug design using this protein as the target is still largely
unexplored. This review focuses on the structural features of Pth, giving a
direction to structure-based drug design on this protein.
