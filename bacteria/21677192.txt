Tunicamycin (TM) inhibits eukaryotic asparagine-linked glycosylation, protein
palmitoylation, ganglioside production, proteoglycan synthesis,
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase activity, and cell wall
biosynthesis in bacteria. Treatment of cells with TM elicits endoplasmic
reticulum stress and activates the unfolded protein response. Although widely
used in laboratory settings for many years, it is unknown how TM enters cells.
Here, we identify in an unbiased genetic screen a transporter of the major
facilitator superfamily, major facilitator domain containing 2A (MFSD2A), as a
critical mediator of TM toxicity. Cells without MFSD2A are TM-resistant, whereas 
MFSD2A-overexpressing cells are hypersensitive. Hypersensitivity is associated
with increased cellular TM uptake concomitant with an enhanced endoplasmic
reticulum stress response. Furthermore, MFSD2A mutant analysis reveals an
important function of the C terminus for correct intracellular localization and
protein stability, and it identifies transmembrane helical amino acid residues
essential for mediating TM sensitivity. Overall, our data uncover a critical role
for MFSD2A by acting as a putative TM transporter at the plasma membrane.
