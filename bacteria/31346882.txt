We analyzed cytokine profile in the sera of CBA mice in 1, 5, and 24 h after
intraperitoneal injection of supernatants of broth cultures of group A
Streptococcus types 1M and 3M and Dochez NY5 type 10M strain. The increase of the
cytokine content was observed in response to supernatants of all three types, but
the highest values were recorded after injection of supernatant of strain
Dochez-NY5. The level of IL-2 increased most drastically (by 51 times) and the
level of IL-5 increased by 8.9 times in comparison with the control. The level of
IL-2 also increased after injection of supernatants of type 1M and type 3M, but
to a lesser extent (by 5 and 2.3 times, respectively). The content of
proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IFNγ in mouse sera increased to a
lesser extent than IL-2 after administration of all three supernatants.
