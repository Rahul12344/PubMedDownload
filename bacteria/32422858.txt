Increasing evidence connects periodontitis with a variety of systemic diseases,
including metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). The proposal of this study was to evaluate the role of diets
rich in saturated fat and cholesterol in some aspects of periodontal diseases in 
a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model of periodontal disease in rabbits and to
assess the influence of a periodontal intervention on hyperlipidemia,
atherosclerosis, and NAFLD progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Male
rabbits were maintained on a commercial standard diet or a diet rich in saturated
fat (3% lard w/w) and cholesterol (1.3% w/w) (HFD) for 40 days. Half of the
rabbits on each diet were treated 2 days per week with intragingival injections
of LPS from Porphyromonas gingivalis. Morphometric analyses revealed that LPS
induced higher alveolar bone loss (ABL) around the first premolar in animals
receiving standard diets, which was exacerbated by the HFD diet. A higher score
of acinar inflammation in the liver and higher blood levels of triglycerides and 
phospholipids were found in HFD-fed rabbits receiving LPS. These results suggest 
that certain dietary habits can exacerbate some aspects of periodontitis and that
bad periodontal health can contribute to dyslipidemia and promote NAFLD
progression, but only under certain conditions.
