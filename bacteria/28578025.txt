Delay in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) stems from the lack of specific
clinical and analytical markers to assist in the early diagnosis and prediction
of progressive course. We propose a decision-tree model that better defines early
at onset MS patients and those with the progressive form by analysing a
12-biomarkers panel in serum and CSF samples of patients with MS, other
neurological diseases (OND) and healthy contols. Thus, patients at onset of
neurological disease were first classified by serum IL-7 levels <141pg/ml
(OR=6.51, p<0.001). Combination of IL-7 and CXCL10 indicated risk for a specific 
MS clinical form, where IL-7<141 and CXCL10<570pg/ml were associated with the
highest risk for PP-MS (OR=22, p=0.01). Unexpectedly, both PP-MS and RR-MS
patients shared significantly decreased prototypical biomarkers of inflammation
and tissue regeneration in CSF than OND suggesting a defective intrinsic immune
response playing a role at the beginning of the disease.
