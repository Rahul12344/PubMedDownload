BACKGROUND & AIMS: Diarrhea associated with inflammatory bowel diseases has been 
associated with increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumor
necrosis factor (TNF). The intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel 
diseases has reduced expression of solute carrier family 26 member 3 (SLC26A3,
also called DRA). We investigated whether TNF directly affects expression of DRA 
in human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and in the intestines of mice, and
studied the mechanisms of these effects.
METHODS: We performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction, immunofluorescence, and immunoblot analyses in Caco-2, HT-29, and T-84 
cells human IECs cultured in 2 or 3 dimensions with or without TNF (50 ng/mL for 
6-24 hours). We purified nuclear extracts and quantified nuclear factor-κB
(NF-κB) activation and DNA binding. We isolated intestinal crypts from C57BL/6
mice, cultured enteroids, incubated these with TNF (50 ng/mL, 24 hours), and
quantified messenger RNAs. DRA-mediated exchange of Cl- for HCO3- was measured by
uptake of 125I. Expression of the NF-κB inhibitor α (IkBa) was knocked down in
Caco-2 cells with small interfering RNAs. Activation of NF-κB in response to TNF 
was measured by luciferase reporter assays; binding of the NF-κB subunit p65 in
cells was analyzed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. DRA promoter activity
was measured in a luciferase reporter assay. C57BL/6 mice were injected with TNF 
(5 μg/mouse for 3-6 hours) or vehicle (control); intestines were collected and
analyzed by immunofluorescence, or RNA and protein were collected from the
mucosa.
RESULTS: Incubation of IECs with TNF reduced expression of DRA. Knockdown of
NF-κB inhibitor α in IECs led to nuclear translocation of the NF-κB subunit p65
and reduced levels of DRA messenger RNA and protein. Expression of a transgene
encoding p65 or p50 in IECs led to significant reductions in the promoter
activity of DRA and its expression. In chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, p65 
bound directly to the promoter of DRA, at the regions of -935 to -629 and -375
to -84. Injection of mice with TNF or incubation of crypt-derived enteroids with 
TNF reduced their expression of DRA messenger RNA and protein.
CONCLUSIONS: In human IECs and intestinal tissues from mice, we found TNF to
activate NF-κB, which reduced expression of the Cl- / HCO3- exchanger DRA
(SLC26A3), via direct binding to the promoter of DRA. This pathway is an
important therapeutic target for inflammatory bowel disease-associated diarrhea.
