Keratinocytes represent the major cell population in the epithelial skin barrier 
and actively participate in innate immune responses by recognizing pathogenic
microorganisms, followed by a fine-tuned production of cytokines, chemokines and 
antimicrobial peptides or proteins (AMPs). Patients with atopic dermatitis (AD)
suffer from a defective permeability barrier which favors pathogen infection
indicating that the permeability and antimicrobial barrier functions are
interdependent. Several early studies showed that the inducible AMPs LL-37, HBD-2
and HBD-3 are expressed at lower levels in atopic skin compared to psoriatic
skin. However, recent data indicate that AMP induction is not compromised in AD
patients and that several AMPs are expressed at significantly higher amounts in
AD compared to healthy skin. AD patients have an increased susceptibility to
Staphylococcus aureus skin infection suggesting that AMP levels expressed by
keratinocytes of AD patients might not be sufficient to combat pathogenic skin
infection or that AMP function is disturbed. Increasing AMP expression in AD skin
and repairing the skin barrier defect might have a therapeutic effect in AD
patients enabling the skin to mount an enhanced response to pathogens.
