Flow cytometry is an established tool in fundamental studies of single-cell
microbial physiology. Here we show that it can also provide valuable information 
for process development. Using recombinant Escherichia coli strains, which
express the protein-based polymer (GVGIP)(260)GVGVP, the utility of flow
cytometry in monitoring and optimization of fermentations is demonstrated. Single
cell right angle light scatter was found to be significantly affected by
intracellular product formation possibly due to the formation of inclusion
bodies. Translational fusions with green fluorescent protein (GFP) enabled
monitoring of product accumulation, as well as plasmid free cell fraction (PFCF).
Such fusions also allowed rapid evaluation of induction strategies and three
different expression systems based on the T7 promoter, T7-lac promoter and the
P(BAD) promoter. The expression system based on the P(BAD) promoter was found to 
be superior to the T7-based system.
