Macrolide-Resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae Infections in Pediatric
Community-Acquired Pneumonia.

Chen YC, Hsu WY, Chang TH.

A high prevalence rate of macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has
been reported in Asia. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to
investigate the effect of macrolide resistance on the manifestations and clinical
judgment during M. pneumoniae infections. We found no difference in clinical
severity between MRMP and macrolide-sensitive Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MSMP)
infections. However, in the pooled data, patients infected with MRMP had a longer
febrile period (1.71 days), length of hospital stay (1.61 day), antibiotic drug
courses (2.93 days), and defervescence time after macrolide treatment (2.04 days)
compared with patients infected with MSMP. The risk of fever lasting for >48
hours after macrolide treatment was also significantly increased (OR 21.24), and 
an increased proportion of patients was changed to second-line treatment (OR
4.42). Our findings indicate diagnostic and therapeutic challenges after the
emergence of MRMP. More precise diagnostic tools and clearly defined treatment
should be appraised in the future.
