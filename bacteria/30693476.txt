BACKGROUND: Human skin is populated by diverse bacteria and there is increasing
evidence that resident bacteria play a key role initiating immune responses in
cutaneous diseases such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and hidradenitis
suppurativa. Bacteria are present at all layers of the skin but many studies have
relied on swabs to profile the skin microbiota.
OBJECTIVES: As the pathogenesis of many skin conditions is dermal, we wanted to
compare the microbiota obtained in swabs (surface) and biopsies (dermis).
METHODS: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing we established the microbial profiles of 
skin swabs and skin biopsies in 16 patients.
RESULTS: We found differences in both diversity and taxonomic composition of the 
microbiome obtained from swabs and biopsies of the same individual. Several taxa 
were found to be more abundant in the swabs, which displayed significantly higher
community richness, but Clostridiales and Bacteroidetes were significantly
enriched in the biopsies. Most published research on cutaneous microbiota has
been based on skin swabs, which represent the surface of the skin.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated a clear difference between the microbiome
observed from skin swabs and skin biopsies. These findings may be highly relevant
in disorders such as psoriasis where pathogenesis arises in the dermis. What's
already known about this topic? 16S RNA gene sequencing has facilitated study of 
the skin microbiome. Several studies have sequenced the microbiome sampled by
skin swabs. What does this study add? The microbiome data obtained using swabs
and biopsies were different. Diseases that are predominantly dermal should be
studied using both swabs and biopsies.
