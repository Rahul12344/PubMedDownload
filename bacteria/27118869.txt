The role of plasma membrane transporters in cancer is receiving increasing
attention in recent years. Several transporters for essential nutrients are
up-regulated in cancer and serve as tumour promoters. Transporters could also
function as tumour suppressors. To date, four transporters belonging to the SLC
gene family have been identified as tumour suppressors. SLC5A8 is a Na(+)-coupled
transporter for monocarboxylates. Among its substrates are the bacterial
fermentation products butyrate and propionate and the ubiquitous metabolite
pyruvate. The tumour-suppressive function of this transporter relates to the
ability of butyrate, propionate and pyruvate to inhibit histone deacetylases
(HDAC). SLC5A8 functions as a tumour suppressor in most tissues studied thus far,
and provides a molecular link to Warburg effect, a characteristic feature in most
cancers. It also links colonic bacteria and dietary fibre to the host. SLC26A3 as
a tumour suppressor is restricted to colon; it is a Cl(-)/HCO(-) 3 exchanger,
facilitating the efflux of HCO(-) 3 The likely mechanism for the
tumour-suppressive function of SLC26A3 is related to intracellular pH regulation.
SLC39A1 is a Zn(2+) transporter and its role in tumour suppression has been shown
in prostate. Zn(2+) is present at high concentrations in normal prostate where it
elicits its tumour-suppressive function. SLC22A18 is possibly an organic cation
transporter, but the identity of its physiological substrates is unknown. As
such, there is no information on molecular pathways responsible for the
tumour-suppressive function of this transporter. It is likely that additional SLC
transporters will be discovered as tumour suppressors in the future.
