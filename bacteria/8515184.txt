The purpose of this review is to provide an interpretative view of work from our 
laboratory on the DRA gene, and incorporate it with work from other laboratories.
Specially, we will deal with: (a) the functional roles of transcription factors
in DRA gene regulation; (b) the mechanisms of DRA induction by cytokines; (c) the
analysis of DRA gene control in primary untransformed cells, and (d) interactions
among transcription factors critical for DRA gene expression.
