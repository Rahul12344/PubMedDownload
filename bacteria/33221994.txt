N-butanol is an important chemical and can be naturally synthesized by
Clostridium species; however, the poor n-butanol tolerance of Clostridium impedes
the further improvement in titer. In this study, Lactobacillus brevis, which
possesses a higher butanol tolerance, was selected as host for heterologous
butanol production. The Clostridium acetobutylicum genes thl, hbd, and crt which 
encode thiolase, β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and crotonase, and the
Treponema denticola gene ter, which encodes trans-enoyl-CoA reductase were cloned
into a single plasmid to express the butanol synthesis pathway in L. brevis. A
titer of 40 mg/L n-butanol was initially achieved with plasmid pLY15-opt, in
which all pathway genes are codon-optimized. A titer of 450 mg/L of n-butanol was
then synthesized when ter was further overexpressed in this pathway. The role of 
metabolic flux was reinforced with pLY15, in which only the ter gene was
codon-optimized, which greatly increased the n-butanol titer to 817 mg/L. Our
strategy significantly improved n-butanol synthesis in L. brevis and the final
titer is the highest achieved amongst butanol-tolerant lactic acid bacteria.
