PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral
blood stem cells are widely used to reconstitute hematopoiesis; however,
preclinical and clinical studies show that improvements to this mobilization can 
be achieved. We discuss the development of new mobilizing regimens and evaluation
of new findings on mobilized stem cell populations that may improve the utility
and convenience of peripheral blood stem cell transplant.
RECENT FINDINGS: Chemokines and their receptors regulate leukocyte trafficking,
and altering chemokine signaling pathways mobilizes stem cells. In recent trials,
combination use of the chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 antagonist AMD3100 and 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilized more CD34 cells in fewer days
than granulocyte colony-stimulating factor alone and allowed more patients to
proceed to autotransplant. In preclinical studies the chemokine GRObeta
synergizes with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and when used alone or with
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor mobilizes more primitive hematopoietic stem
cells with less apoptosis, higher integrin activation, lower CD26 expression and 
enhanced marrow homing compared with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
Hematopoietic stem cells mobilized by GRObeta or AMD3100 demonstrate superior
engraftment and contribution to chimerism in primary and secondary transplant
studies in mice, and peripheral blood stem cells mobilized by AMD3100 and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in patients demonstrate enhanced
engraftment capabilities in immunodeficient mice.
SUMMARY: Alternate regimens differentially mobilize stem cell populations with
unique intrinsic properties with the potential to expand the utility of
hematopoietic transplantation. Continued mechanistic evaluation will be critical 
to our understanding of mechanisms of mobilization and their use in regenerative 
medicine.
