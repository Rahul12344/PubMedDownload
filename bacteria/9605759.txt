Due to the potential clinical relevance of HLA class I antigen losses in melanoma
cells and the scanty information about the molecular mechanisms underlying these 
defects, we have characterized the cause of the HLA-A2 antigen loss by autologous
melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-29.1.22 and SK-MEL-29.1.29. Both cell lines have
structural defects of HLA-A2 genes, which cause lack of their transcription. In
SK-MEL-29.1.22 cells the 5'-flanking region, exon 1, intron 1, and a region at
the 5' end of exon 2 of the HLA-A2 gene are deleted. The breakpoint of the HLA-A2
gene, which is recombined with a DNA fragment of unknown origin, was localized
between two GTTCG sequence repeats at position 101 of exon 2. These repeats may
provide the sequence basis for misalignment in the process of DNA deletion. In
SK-MEL-29.1.29 cells, loss of HLA-A2 antigens, as well as of HLA-B44 and HLA-Cw5 
alleles, is caused by the loss of one copy of chromosome 6. Down-regulation of
the expressed HLA class I alleles in the two HLA-A2 loss variants and in the
parental cells was found to be associated with a low TAP1 expression and a
reduced function of peptide transporters. Therefore, multiple defects result in
loss or down-regulation of HLA class I alleles in SK-MEL-29.1.22 and
SK-MEL-29.1.29 melanoma cells.
