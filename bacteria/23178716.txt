SnoN/SkiL (TGFβ regulator) is dysregulated in ovarian cancer, a disease
associated with acquired drug-resistance. Arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃, used in
treating APL) induces SnoN to oppose the apoptotic response in ovarian cancer
cells. We now report that As₂O₃ increases phosphorylation of EGFR/p66ShcA and
EGFR degradation. As₂O₃ activates Src(Y416) whose activity (inhibited by PP2)
modulates EGFR activation, its interaction with Shc/Grb2, and p-AKT. Inhibition
of PI3K reduces SnoN and cell survival. Although EGFR or MAPK1 siRNA did not
alter SnoN expression, As₂O₃-induced cleaved PARP was reduced together with
increased XIAP. Collectively, As₂O₃ mediates an initial rise in pY-Src(416) to
regulate the PI3K/AKT pathway which increases SnoN and cell survival; these early
events may counter the cell death response associated with increased pY-EGFR/MAPK
activation.
