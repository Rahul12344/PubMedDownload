Stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment play a supportive role in tumor
growth, progression, and treatment resistance; therefore, these nonmalignant
cells are potential therapeutic targets. In this issue of the JCI, Szot et al.
devised a strategy to exploit the cell-surface marker TEM8 (also known as
ANTXR1), which is expressed by cancer-associated stromal cells, as a zip code to 
deliver an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) linked to the potent cancer-killing drug
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). In preclinical tumor and experimental metastasis 
models of multiple cancer types, TEM8-ADC targeted TEM8-expressing
cancer-associated stromal cells, which processed and liberated membrane-permeable
MMAE and released this drug via the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) drug transporter.
Released MMAE killed cancer cells through a bystander mechanism that did minimal 
damage to the stromal cells themselves. P-gp-expressing tumor cells displayed
MMAE resistance, suggesting that P-gp expression status may identify patients who
might benefit the most from TEM8-ADC. This strategy, termed DAaRTS (drug
activation and release through stroma), represents an elegant example of how
selective expression of a cell-surface molecule on cancer-associated stroma can
be exploited to facilitate drug delivery and shrink solid tumors.
