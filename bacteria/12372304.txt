Methylation of lysine residues in the N-terminal tails of histones is thought to 
represent an important component of the mechanism that regulates chromatin
structure. The evolutionarily conserved SET domain occurs in most proteins known 
to possess histone lysine methyltransferase activity. We present here the crystal
structure of a large fragment of human SET7/9 that contains a N-terminal
beta-sheet domain as well as the conserved SET domain. Mutagenesis identifies two
residues in the C terminus of the protein that appear essential for catalytic
activity toward lysine-4 of histone H3. Furthermore, we show how the cofactor
AdoMet binds to this domain and present biochemical data supporting the role of
invariant residues in catalysis, binding of AdoMet, and interactions with the
peptide substrate.
