The D-alanyl-D-alanine-adding enzyme encoded by the murF gene catalyzes the
ATP-dependent formation of
UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-gamma-D-Glu-meso-diaminopimelyl-D-Ala-D-Ala
(UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide). MurF has been cloned from Escherichia coli and expressed
as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion using the tac promoter-based pGEX-KT 
vector. From induced, broken cell preparations, highly active fusion was
recovered and purified in one step by affinity chromatography. The purified
fusion protein was strongly inhibited by substrate UDPMurNAc-tripeptide, a
response unaltered by changes in assay pH or by cleavage from the fusion partner.
However, this effect was suppressed by the addition of 0.5 M NaCl. Initial
velocity and dead-end inhibitor studies with the fusion enzyme were most
consistent with a sequential ordered kinetic mechanism for the forward reaction
in which ATP binds to free enzyme, followed by tripeptide and D-Ala-D-Ala in
sequence prior to product release. Reported homologies between the MurF protein
and the three preceding steps of cytoplasmic murein biosynthesis, MurC, -D, and
-E, [Ikeda et al. (1990) J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 36, 179-187], raise the
prospect that all of these enzymes will be found to proceed via this mechanism.
