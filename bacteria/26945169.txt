OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to evaluate, in rats: i) the effects 
of Bacillus species on the development of experimental periodontitis (EP) via
microtomographic, immunological and hematological assays (Experiment 1-E1); ii)
the effects of Bacillus species as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (SRP) for
the treatment of EP via histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses
(Experiment 2-E2).
METHODS: In E1, 24 rats were divided into groups C1 (control), PROB1, EP1 and
EP-PROB1. In groups with EP, the mandibular first molar of each animal received a
ligature for 14 days. In groups PROB1, animals received Bacillus species for 44
days, starting 30 days before EP induction in Group EP-PROB1. In E2, 24 rats were
assigned to groups C2 (control), PROB2, EP-SRP2 and EP-SRP-PROB2. In groups with 
SRP, EP was induced as described in E1. The ligatures were removed after 14 days 
and SRP was performed. In groups PROB2, animals received Bacillus species for 15 
days, starting after SRP in Group EP-SRP-PROB2.
RESULTS: In E1, Group EP1 presented bone loss (BL) and eosinophil numbers greater
than Group EP-PROB1 (P<0.05). In Group EP-PROB1, the receptor activator of
nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) ratio was similar to that 
of groups without EP. In E2, Group EP-SRP-PROB2 presented fewer TRAP-positive
osteoclasts, lower immunolabeling pattern for a proinflammatory cytokine and
decreased BL and attachment loss than Group EP-SRP2 (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Bacillus species supplementation provided a protective effect
against BL and enhanced the effects of SRP in the treatment of EP in rats.
