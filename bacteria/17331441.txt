OBJECTIVE: To observe the effects of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg),
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (Aa), Escherichia coli (Ec)
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the production of IL-11 and IL-6 from healthy human 
gingival fibroblasts (HGF), and the effects of endogenous prostaglandin on HGF
IL-11 and IL-6 production stimulated with the above LPS.
METHODS: HGF were stimulated with Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS of different concentrations
(0.1, 1, 10 mg/L) for 24 h. And HGF were also stimulated with the combinations of
10 mg/L Pg-, Aa-, Ec-LPS and 10(-6) mol/L indomethacin respectively for 24 h.
Levels of IL-11 and IL-6 in the supernatants were quantitated by ELISA.
RESULTS: LPS from Aa, Ec, at the concentration of 10 mg/L and from Pg at the
concentrations 1, 10 mg/L significantly augmented IL-11 production by HGF. IL-6
production was also significantly increased by stimulation with Aa-LPS at
concentrations 1, 10 mg/L and with Ec-, Pg-LPS at concentrations 0.1, 1, 10 mg/L.
In addition, IL-11 production was lower than IL-6 production by HGF stimulated
with LPS. Indomethacin significantly inhibited IL-6 and IL-11 production in
LPS-stimulated HGF.
CONCLUSIONS: Aa-, Pg-, Ec-LPS may significantly increase IL-11 and IL-6 level in 
the supernatants of HGF, and endogenous prostaglandin may upregulate IL-11 and
IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated HGF.
