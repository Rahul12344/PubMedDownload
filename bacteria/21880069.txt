BACKGROUND AND AIM: In order to explore a new therapeutic method, we investigated
the effects of exogenously expressed hepatocyte growth factor mediated by
attenuated salmonella (TPH) on rats with ulcerative colitis (UC) induced by 2-,
4-, 6-trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid.
METHODS: The UC rats were treated with TPH, attenuated salmonella with a
eukaryotic expression vector (TP) or sodium bicarbonate (model control [MC])
every other day. Cluster of differentiation (CD)4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and
immunoglobulins in the blood were analyzed by flow cytometry. The HGF expression 
was determined by immunohistochemistry. A macroscopic-scale observation of the
colon and a histological assessment were also carried out.
RESULTS: The CD4(+) T counts and the CD4(+) /CD8(+) ratio in the TPH group were
significantly lower than that in the MC group. The immunoglobulin M and
immunoglobulin G(1) levels in the TPH group were significantly lower than that in
the MC group and TP group. After treatment with TPH, the symptoms of the
ulcerative rats were significantly alleviated. The colonic lesion grades in the
TPH group were lower than that in the TP group and MC group. Significant
improvement occurred after the TPH treatment, as evidenced by alleviated mucosal 
inflammation. At 7 days post-treatment, the HGF expression in the colonic tissues
that were treated with TPH was stronger than that in the samples treated with TP.
CONCLUSIONS: TPH inhibits the proliferation of T lymphocytes and the antibody
production of B lymphocytes. Furthermore, it ameliorates mucosal inflammation and
promotes the regeneration of mucosa and the healing of the colonic ulceration.
