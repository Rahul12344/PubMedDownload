Fyn kinase is implicated in prostate cancer. We illustrate the role of
miR-125a-3p in cellular pathways accounted for motility and migration of prostate
cancer cells, probably through its regulation on Fyn expression and
Fyn-downstream proteins. Prostate cancer PC3 cells were transiently transfected
with empty miR-Vec (control) or with miR-125a-3p. Overexpression of miR-125a-3p
reduced migration of PC3 cells and increased apoptosis. Live cell confocal
imaging indicated that overexpression of miR-125a-3p reduced the cells' track
speed and length and impaired phenotype. Fyn, FAK and paxillin, displayed reduced
activity following miR-125a-3p overexpression. Accordingly, actin rearrangement
and cells' protrusion formation were impaired. An inverse correlation between
miR-125a-3p and Gleason score was observed in human prostate cancer tissues. Our 
study demonstrated that miR-125a-3p may regulate migration of prostate cancer
cells.
