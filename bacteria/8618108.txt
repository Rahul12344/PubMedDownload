In this open comparative and prospective study 180 adults of either sex were
randomised to treatment with either amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) 500/125mg
tid or cefetamet pivoxil (CAT) 500mg bid for 7 days. Demographic data and
assessable findings were similar in both groups. Clinical outcomes of 169
assessable patients showed high efficacy of both drugs: 92% with AMC and 96% with
CAT. Bacteriological response rates were equivalent in 141 evaluable cases: 84%
vs. 89%, respectively. Baseline susceptibility testing (DIN) revealed a notable
number of Haemophilus species either intermediately susceptible or resistant to
AMC. Gastrointestinal disorders predominated among the adverse events with
diarrhea occurring nearly twice as often in the AMC group. CAT is an effective
and safe alternative option in the treatment of AECB in adults. The advantage of 
CAT is its enhanced activity against gram-negative bacteria. It is well
tolerated.
