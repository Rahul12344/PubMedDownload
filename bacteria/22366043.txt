CD56+ T cells were studied in samples of peripheral blood from small-cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients compared with
healthy controls. Relative numbers of CD56+CD3+ cells were increased in NSCLC (P 
= 0.001) and SCLC (P = 0.002) compared with normal subjects but their ability to 
respond to activation by up-regulating CD25 or producing IFN-Î³ were both
significantly impaired. Expression of the killer-immunoglobulin-like receptor
CD158a was significantly lower on CD56+CD3+ cells in SCLC than controls and also 
in early stage compared with late stage NSCLC patients. Mean levels of CD158e
were higher in NSCLC patients than controls. CD158e levels on CD56+CD3+ cells
were increased in the presence of its ligand HLA-Bw4 compared with controls.
Although the precise role of CD56+CD3+ cells is not clear, they appear to be
functionally impaired in lung cancer, which may have implications for a reduction
of direct or indirect anti-tumour responses.
