CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) is the main receptor for CSF1 and
has crucial roles in regulating myelopoeisis. CSF1R can be proteolytically
released from the cell surface by ADAM17 (A disintegrin and metalloprotease 17). 
Here, we identified CSF1R as a major substrate of ADAM17 in an unbiased
degradomics screen. We explored the impact of CSF1R shedding by ADAM17 and its
upstream regulator, inactive rhomboid protein 2 (iRhom2, gene name Rhbdf2), on
homeostatic development of mouse myeloid cells. In iRhom2-/- mice, we found
constitutive accumulation of membrane-bound CSF1R on myeloid cells at steady
state, although cell numbers of these populations were not altered. However, in
the context of mixed bone marrow (BM) chimera, under competitive pressure,
iRhom2-/- BM progenitor-derived monocytes, tissue macrophages and lung DCs showed
a repopulation advantage over those derived from wild-type (WT) BM progenitors,
suggesting enhanced CSF1R signaling in the absence of iRhom2. In vitro
experiments indicate that iRhom2-/- Lin- SCA-1+ c-Kit+ (LSKs) cells, but not
granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs), had faster growth rates than WT cells 
in response to CSF1. Our results shed light on an important role of iRhom2/ADAM17
pathway in regulation of CSF1R shedding and repopulation of monocytes,
macrophages and DCs.
