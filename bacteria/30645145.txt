Rationale: Two biologic phenotypes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 
have been identified based on plasma protein markers in four previous studies.
Objectives: To determine if blood leukocyte gene expression is different between 
the "reactive" and "uninflamed" phenotype. Methods: This is a new study adding
blood leukocyte transcriptomics and bioinformatics analysis to an existing
patient cohort of ARDS in patients with sepsis admitted to two ICUs during a
1.5-year period. Canonical pathway analysis was performed. Measurements and Main 
Results: A total of 210 patients with sepsis and ARDS were included, of whom 128 
had a reactive and 82 an uninflamed phenotype. A total of 3,332/11,443 (29%)
transcripts were significantly different between the phenotypes. Canonical
pathway analysis showed upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation genes
indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction (52% of genes in pathway). The uninflamed
phenotype was characterized by upregulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathways. Conclusions: A third of genes are differentially expressed between
biologic phenotypes of ARDS supporting the observation that the subgroups of ARDS
are incomparable in terms of pathophysiology. These data provide additional
support for biologic heterogeneity in patients with ARDS and suggests that a
personalized approach to intervention focusing on oxidative phosphorylation is
pivotal in this condition.
