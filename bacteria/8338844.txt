To understand the structure of the hormone binding domain (HBD) of human beta 1
thyroid hormone nuclear receptor (h-TR beta 1), truncated h-TR beta 1 fragments, 
MD32 (M169-D456), KD29 (K201-D456), DD28 (D211-D456), KD25 (K235-D456), and KP28 
(K201-P448), were analyzed by circular dichorism (CD). MD32 and KD29 show intense
CD spectra with double minima at 222 and 208-210 nm, indicating the presence of
extensive regions of alpha-helix. DD28 and KD25 have spectra which are reduced in
intensity with minima around 215 nm, characteristic of a beta-sheet. The observed
spectra are compatible with sequence analysis which predicts that HBD contains
alternating stretches of alpha-helix and beta-strand. These extensive decreases
in secondary structure in DD28 and KP28 in which the predicted first beta-strand 
or last alpha-helix was deleted, respectively, were accompanied by the loss of
hormone binding activity. On the basis of these results, we suggest a new model
for h-TR beta 1 consisting of the known DNA binding domain linked by an
alpha-helical hinge to the HBD, with the tertiary structure of an alpha/beta
barrel. The model is compatible with previous chemical and genetic studies on the
structure of this protein.
