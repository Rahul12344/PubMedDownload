Mammary gland development is fueled by stem cell self-renewal and
differentiation. External cues from the microenvironment coupled with internal
cues such as post-transcriptional regulation exerted by microRNAs regulate stem
cell behavior and fate. Here, we have identified a miR-205 regulatory network
required for mammary gland ductal development and stem cell regeneration
following transplantation into the cleared mammary fat pad. In the postnatal
mammary gland, miR-205 is predominantly expressed in the basal/stem cell enriched
population. Conditional deletion of miR-205 in mammary epithelial cells impairs
stem cell self-renewal and mammary regenerative potential in the in vitro
mammosphere formation assay and in vivo mammary reconstitution. miR-205 null
transplants display significant changes in basal cells, basement membrane, and
stroma. NKD1 and PTPA, which inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway, and AMOT, which
causes YAP cytoplasmic retention and inactivation were identified as miR-205
downstream mediators. These studies also confirmed that miR-205 is a direct ΔNp63
target gene that is critical for the regulation of basal cell identity. Stem
