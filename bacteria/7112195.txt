Catheter-associated septic thrombophlebitis.

Garrison RN, Richardson JD, Fry DE.

The clinical presentation and results of management of septic thrombophlebitis in
35 patients over a seven-year period are reviewed. There were 25 men and ten
women; 20 patients were over age 50. At diagnosis, fever was present in 33
patients (94%), and 33 (94%) had local signs of inflammation. Pus was expressed
from the infusion site in 25 patients (71%). All patients had plastic catheters, 
with 95% present longer than 48 hours. Klebsiella-Enterobacter was the dominant
organism both at the infusion site and in the blood. All patients had surgical
excision of the infected vein, followed in 60% by rapid lysis of fever. Other
infections were responsible for persistent fever after total excision. Septic
thrombophlebitis is best prevented by strict asepsis in catheter placement and
rotation of infusion sites every 48 hours. Total excision of the infected vein
remains the treatment of choice.
