The short-chain fatty acid receptors FFA2 (GPR43) and FFA3 (GPR41) are activated 
by acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These ligands are produced by bacteria in
the gut. In addition, the body itself can in particular produce acetate, and
acetate plasma levels have been shown to be increased, e.g., in diabetic patients
or during periods of starvation. FFA2 and FFA3 are both expressed by
enteroendocrine cells and pancreatic Î²-cells. In addition, FFA2 is found on
immune cells and adipocytes, whereas FFA3 is expressed by some peripheral
neurons. It has therefore been speculated that short-chain fatty acid receptors
are involved in the regulation of various body functions under different
nutritional and metabolic conditions. Here we summarize recent data on the role
of FFA2 and FFA3 in the regulation of metabolic, immunological, and neuronal
functions and discuss the potential pharmacological relevance of this receptor
system.
