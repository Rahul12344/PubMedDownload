The spleen is an immune lymphatic organ linked with control of the immune
response, which is important to fish health. Recent evidence has suggested the
involvement of purinergic signaling in the modulation of immune and inflammatory 
responses through the nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the nucleoside 
adenosine (Ado), which are regulated by the enzymes nucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase), 5'-nucleotidase, and adenosine deaminase (ADA).
Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether purinergic signaling can
modulate the immune and inflammatory responses in the spleen of silver catfish
(Rhamdia quelen) naturally infected with Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Splenic
NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities increased in infected animals compared
with uninfected animals, while the splenic ADA activity decreased. These data
indicate that purinergic signaling can modulate the splenic immune and
inflammatory responses through the regulation of ATP and Ado levels, which are
known to participate in the physiological and pathological responses as
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules, respectively. In summary,
modulation of the splenic purinergic cascade has an anti-inflammatory role in
reducing or preventing inflammatory damage.
