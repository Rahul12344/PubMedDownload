Exogenic allergic alveolitides are caused by organic dusts which contain
bacteria, moulds or vegetable and animal antigens. The farmer's lung as a form of
the exogenic allergic alveolitis is a rare disease. The uncharacteristic
symptomatology in the initial phase and in particular the retarded beginning of
the symptom after several hours handicap the timely recognition in an early phase
of the disease so that curative therapeutic measures are rarely possible. The
cases of the disease are found only at the chronic stage, at the stage of the
pulmonary fibrosis. Then the prognosis is unfavourable. In the Central Clinic for
Heart and Lung Diseases Bad Berka 1,110 patients with alveolitides and lung
fibroses were diagnosed in the period from 1975 to 1988. 306 of them could be
clarified as exogenic allergic alveolitis, 61 of them (19.8%) were farmer's
lungs.
