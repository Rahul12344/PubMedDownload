BACKGROUND: The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) determined the etiologic 
agents of moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children under 5 years old in
Africa and Asia. Here, we describe the prevalence and antimicrobial
susceptibility of non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) serovars in GEMS and examine the
phylogenetics of Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 isolates.
METHODS: Salmonella isolated from children with MSD or diarrhea-free controls
were identified by classical clinical microbiology and serotyped using antisera
and/or whole genome sequence data. We evaluated antimicrobial susceptibility
using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Salmonella Typhimurium sequence
types were determined using multi-locus sequence typing and whole genome
sequencing was performed to assess the phylogeny of ST313.
RESULTS: Out of 370 Salmonella-positive individuals, 190 (51.4%) were MSD cases
and 180 (48.6%) were diarrhea-free controls. The most frequent Salmonella
serovars identified were Salmonella Typhimurium, serogroup O:8 (C2-C3), serogroup
O:6,7 (C1), Salmonella Paratyphi B Java and serogroup O:4 (B). The prevalence of 
NTS was low but similar across sites, regardless of age, and was similar amongst 
both cases and controls except in Kenya, where Salmonella Typhimurium was more
commonly associated with cases than controls. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
these Salmonella Typhimurium isolates, all ST313, were highly genetically related
to isolates from controls. Generally, Salmonella isolates from Asia were
resistant to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone but African isolates were susceptible 
to these antibiotics.
CONCLUSION: Our data confirms that NTS is prevalent, albeit at low levels, in
Africa and South Asia. Our findings provide further evidence that multi-drug
resistant Salmonella Typhimurium ST313 can be carried asymptomatically by humans 
in sub-Saharan Africa.
