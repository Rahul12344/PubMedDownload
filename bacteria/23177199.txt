Motile predatory Myxobacteria are producers of multiple secondary metabolites
and, on starvation, undergo concerted cellular differentiation to form
multicellular fruiting bodies. These abilities demand myxobacterial genomes to
encode sophisticated regulatory networks that are not satisfactorily understood. 
Here, we present two bacterial enhancer binding proteins (bEBPs) encoded in
Myxococcus xanthus acting as direct regulators of secondary metabolites
intriguingly exhibiting activating and inhibitory effects. Elucidation of a
regulon for each bEBP enabled us to unravel their role in myxococcal development,
predation, and motility. Interestingly, both bEBPs are able to interact by
forming a hetero-oligomeric complex. Our findings represent an alternative mode
of operation of bEBPs, which are currently thought to enhance promoter activity
by acting as homo-oligomers. Furthermore, a direct link between secondary
metabolite gene expression and predation, motility, and cellular development
could be shown for the first time.
