The bare lymphocyte syndrome, a severe combined immunodeficiency due to loss of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II gene expression, is caused by
inherited mutations in the genes encoding the heterotrimeric transcription factor
RFX (RFX-B, RFX5, and RFXAP) and the class II transactivator CIITA. Mutagenesis
of the RFX genes was performed, and the properties of the proteins were analyzed 
with regard to transactivation, DNA binding, and protein-protein interactions.
The results identified specific domains within each of the three RFX subunits
that were necessary for RFX complex formation, including the ankyrin repeats of
RFX-B. DNA binding was dependent on RFX complex formation, and transactivation
was dependent on a region of RFX5. RFX5 was found to interact with CIITA, and
this interaction was dependent on a proline-rich domain within RFX5. Thus, these 
studies have defined the protein domains required for the functional regulation
of MHC class II genes.
