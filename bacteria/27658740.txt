BACKGROUND: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are bone marrow-derived cells
that contribute to vascular repair. EPCs may be reduced in HIV-infected (HIV+)
persons, contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Telmisartan is an
angiotensin receptor blocker that increases EPCs in HIV-uninfected adults.
OBJECTIVE: To assess telmisartan's effects on EPC number and immunophenotype in
older HIV + adults at risk for CVD.
METHODS: HIV + persons ≥50 years old with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL on suppressive
antiretroviral therapy and ≥1 CVD risk factor participated in a prospective,
open-label, pilot study of oral telmisartan 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Using CD34 
and CD133 as markers of early maturity and KDR as a marker of endothelial lineage
commitment, EPCs were quantified via flow cytometry and defined as viable
CD3-/CD33-/CD19-/glycophorin- cells of four immunophenotypes: CD133+/KDR+,
CD34+/KDR+, CD34+/CD133+, or CD34+/KDR+/CD133+. The primary endpoint was a
12-week change in EPC subsets (NCT01578772).
RESULTS: Seventeen participants (88% men, median age 60 years and peripheral CD4+
T lymphocyte count 625 cells/mm3) enrolled and completed the study. After 6 and
12 weeks of telmisartan, frequencies of all EPC immunophenotypes were higher than
baseline (all p < 0.10 except week 12 CD133+/KDR+ EPC, p = 0.13). Participants
with lower baseline EPC levels had the largest gains. Additionally, the
percentage of CD34+ cells with endothelial commitment (KDR+) increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that telmisartan use is associated with an increase
in circulating EPCs in older HIV + individuals with CVD risk factors. Further
controlled studies are needed to assess whether EPC increases translate to a
reduction in CVD risk in this population.
