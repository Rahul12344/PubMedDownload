A protocol was devised which permitted the extraction of DNA from deep marine
sediments up to 503 m below the sea floor. These sediments have been laid down
over the last 3 million years. 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from the
DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. The details of the successful extraction
and polymerase chain reaction methodology varied between samples from different
depths. This emphasizes the attention to detail required to allow the diversity
of bacteria in these deep sediments to be studied.
