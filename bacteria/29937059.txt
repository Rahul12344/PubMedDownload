A series of quinoylalkyl side chains was designed and synthesized, followed by
introduction into ketolides by coupling with building block 6 or 32. The
corresponding targets 7a-n, 33b, and 33e were tested for their in vitro
activities against a series of macrolide-sensitive and macrolide-resistant
pathogens. Some of them showed a similar antibacterial spectrum and comparable
activity to telithromycin. Among them, two C2-F ketolides, compounds 33b and 33e,
displayed excellent activities against macrolide-sensitive and
macrolide-resistant pathogens.
