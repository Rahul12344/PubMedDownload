In this study we show the inheritance of a CD4+ CD8+ peripheral Tcell population 
in the H.B15 chicken strain. A large proportion of alphabeta T cells in
peripheral blood (20-40%), spleen (10-20%) and intestinal epithelium (5-10%)
coexpress CD4 and CD8alpha, but not CD8beta. CD4+ CD8alpha alpha cells are
functionally normal T cells, since they proliferate in response to mitogens and
signals delivered via the alphabeta T cell receptor as well as via the CD28
co-receptor. These cells induce in vivo a graft versus host-reaction, providing
further evidence for their function as CD4+ T cells. The CD4+ CD8alpha alpha T
cell population was found in 75% of the first progeny and in 100% of further
progenies, demonstrating that coexpression of CD4 and CD8 on peripheral T cells
is an inherited phenomenon. In addition, cross-breeding data suggest a dominant
Mendelian form of inheritance. The hereditary expression of CD8alpha on
peripheral CD4+ T cells in chicken provides a unique model in which to study the 
regulation of CD4 and CD8 expression.
