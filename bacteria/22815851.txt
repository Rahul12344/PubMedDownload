The Bacille-Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine does not provide consistent protection 
against adult pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) worldwide. As novel TB vaccine
candidates advance in studies and clinical trials, it will be critically
important to evaluate their global coverage by assessing the impact of host and
pathogen variability on vaccine efficacy. In this study, we focus on the impact
that host genetic variability may have on the protective effect of TB vaccine
candidates Ag85B-ESAT-6, Ag85B-TB10.4, and Mtb72f. We use open-source epitope
binding prediction programs to evaluate the binding of vaccine epitopes to Class 
I HLA (A, B, and C) and Class II HLA (DRB1) alleles. Our findings suggest that
Mtb72f may be less consistently protective than either Ag85B-ESAT-6 or
Ag85B-TB10.4 in populations with a high TB burden, while Ag85B-TB10.4 may provide
the most consistent protection. The findings of this study highlight the utility 
of bioinformatics as a tool for evaluating vaccine candidates before the costly
stages of clinical trials and informing the development of new vaccines with the 
broadest possible population coverage.
