T helper 17 (Th17)-cell differentiation triggered by interleukin-6 (IL-6) via
STAT3 activation promotes inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
patients. However, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6 family cytokine,
restricts inflammation by blocking Th17-cell differentiation via an unknown
mechanism. Here, we report that microbiota dysregulation promotes LIF secretion
by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in a mouse colitis model. LIF greatly
activates STAT4 phosphorylation on multiple SPXX elements within the C-terminal
transcription regulation domain. STAT4 and STAT3 act reciprocally on both
canonical cis-inducible elements (SIEs) and noncanonical "AGG" elements at
different loci. In lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs), STAT4 activation by LIF
blocks STAT3-dependent Il17a/Il17f promoter activation, whereas in IECs, LIF
bypasses the extraordinarily low level of STAT4 to induce YAP gene expression via
STAT3 activation. In addition, we found that the administration of LIF is
sufficient to restore microbiome homeostasis. Thus, LIF effectively inhibits Th17
accumulation and promotes repair of damaged intestinal epithelium in inflamed
colon, serves as a potential therapy for IBD.
