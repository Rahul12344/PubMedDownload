A population of Vdelta1(+)Vgamma9(-) gammadelta T cells that represented almost
the totality (84%) of circulating lymphocytes in a patient with chronic,
non-HIV-related, CD4 lymphocytopenia complicated by a disseminated Mycobacterium 
intracellulare infection was characterized. These gammadelta(+) T cells expressed
a single killer inhibitory receptor (CD158b) and their phenotype
(CD8(+)CD57(+)CD27(-)CD28(-)) indicated that, although CD45RA(+), they were not
naive. However, the absence of large granular lymphocyte morphology, the impaired
proliferative activity, the high susceptibility to apoptosis, and the total lack 
of cytotoxic ability suggested that these gammadelta cells were in a resting
state. A high percentage of the cells did not harbor the CD11b integrin alpha
chain and exhibited a decreased capability to bind endothelial cells. This defect
might represent the mechanism whereby they remained trapped in the circulation.
