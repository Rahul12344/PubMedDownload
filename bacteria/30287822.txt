Herein we introduce a high-throughput method, INTERFACE, to reveal the capacity
of contiguous RNA nucleotides to establish in vivo intermolecular RNA
interactions for the purpose of functional characterization of intracellular RNA.
INTERFACE enables simultaneous accessibility interrogation of an unlimited number
of regions by coupling regional hybridization detection to transcription
elongation outputs measurable by RNA-seq. We profile over 900 RNA interfaces in
71 validated, but largely mechanistically under-characterized, Escherichia coli
sRNAs in the presence and absence of a global regulator, Hfq, and find that
two-thirds of tested sRNAs feature Hfq-dependent regions. Further, we identify in
vivo hybridization patterns that hallmark functional regions to uncover mRNA
targets. In this way, we biochemically validate 25 mRNA targets, many of which
are not captured by typically tested, top-ranked computational predictions. We
additionally discover direct mRNA binding activity within the GlmY terminator,
highlighting the information value of high-throughput RNA accessibility data.
