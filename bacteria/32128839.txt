The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway plays an essential role in epithelial cells
during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. However, the molecular
mechanism linking stromal signals to YAP-mediated intestinal regeneration and
tumorigenesis is poorly defined. Here, we report a stroma-epithelium ISLR-YAP
signaling axis essential for stromal cells to modulate epithelial cell growth
during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis. Specifically, upon inflammation
and in cancer, an oncogenic transcription factor ETS1 in stromal cells induces
expression of a secreted protein ISLR that can inhibit Hippo signaling and
activate YAP in epithelial cells. Deletion of Islr in stromal cells in mice
markedly impaired intestinal regeneration and suppressed tumorigenesis in the
colon. Moreover, the expression of stromal cell-specific ISLR and ETS1
significantly increased in inflamed mucosa of human IBD patients and in human
colorectal adenocarcinoma, accounting for the epithelial YAP hyperactivation.
Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the signaling crosstalk
between stroma and epithelium during tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.
