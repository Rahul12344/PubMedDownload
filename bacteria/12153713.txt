The dcw cluster of genes involved in cell division and cell wall synthesis from
the piezophilic deep-sea bacterium Shewanella violacea was isolated and
characterized. It comprises 15 open reading frames, of which the organization is 
mraZ-mraW-ftsL-ftsI-murE-murF-mraY-murD-ftsW-murG-murC-ftsQ-ftsA-ftsZ-envA, in
that order. To analyze transcription upstream from the ftsZ gene, Northern blot
and primer extension analyses were performed. The results showed that gene
expression is not pressure dependent. Western blot analysis showed that the FtsZ 
protein is equally expressed under several pressure conditions in the range of
atmospheric (0.1 MPa) to high (50 MPa) pressures. Using immunofluorescence
microscopy, the FtsZ ring was observed in the center of cells at pressure
conditions of 0.1 to 50 MPa. These results imply that the FtsZ protein function
is not affected by elevated pressure in this piezophilic bacterium.
