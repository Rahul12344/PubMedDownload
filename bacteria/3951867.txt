Halitosis.

Bogdasarian RS.

Halitosis, or bad breath, is a universally experienced condition that is usually 
resolved by common practices of oral hygiene. Medical or dental evaluation is
sought by many patients with halitosis of elusive etiology. The physician
knowledgeable in the many causes of halitosis can appropriately diagnose and
manage these cases.
