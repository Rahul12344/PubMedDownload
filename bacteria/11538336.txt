Normal sulfur isotope effects averaging epsilon = -5.2 +/- 1.4% (s.d.) were
consistently observed for the oxidation of sulfide in aqueous solution. Reaction 
products were sulfate, thiosulfate and sulfite at pH 10.8-11 in distilled water; 
S0 was formed in two experiments with synthetic seawater at pH 8-9.5. Because the
-5.2% normal isotope effect differs significantly from the previously measured
+2% inverse effect associated with anaerobic oxidation of sulfide by
photosynthetic bacteria, stable sulfur isotopic measurements are potentially
useful for distinguishing aerobic vs. anaerobic sulfide oxidation in marine and
freshwater sulfureta.
