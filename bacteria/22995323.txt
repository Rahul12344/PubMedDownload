BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that a CXCR2 receptor antagonist would inhibit the
recruitment and activation of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the
lung in subjects with cystic fibrosis. The objective of this study was to
evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacodynamics of SB-656933, an oral
CXCR2 antagonist.
METHODS: 146 adult CF patients were randomized to receive either placebo or
SB-656933 20mg or 50mg once daily for 28days. The primary endpoint was safety;
secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, blood and sputum biomarkers,
sputum microbiology, pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms.
RESULTS: SB-656933 was generally well tolerated. The most frequent adverse event 
was headache. Five subjects were withdrawn due to adverse events. In subjects
receiving SB-656933 50mg, sputum neutrophils and elastase were reduced compared
to baseline (probability of a true reduction, 0.889 and 0.882 respectively), and 
free DNA reduced compared to placebo (probability of a true reduction, 0.967),
while blood levels of fibrinogen, CRP and CXCL8 were increased. There were no
changes in lung function or respiratory symptoms. Average plasma concentrations
of SB-656933 were lower than predicted based on previous studies, only breaching 
IC50 for ~4h at the 50mg dose.
CONCLUSIONS: SB-656933 was well-tolerated in adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
Patients receiving a daily dose of 50mg showed trends for improvement in sputum
inflammatory biomarkers despite potential blunting of effects by lower than
expected plasma concentrations. Although the increase in systemic inflammatory
markers requires further evaluation, CXCR2 antagonism may be a useful approach
for modulating airway inflammation in patients with cystic fibrosis. Clinical
trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00903201).
