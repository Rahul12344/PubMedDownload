Polymers of glucose, the most abundant and one of the biologically important
natural products, named glucans are widely present in fungi, bacteria, mammals,
and plants with various anomeric configurations and glycosidic linkages. Because 
of their structural diversity, the unified strategy for the assembly of pure
glucans is yet to be developed. Herein, we describe a general strategy that is
applicable to construction of all types of glucans by exploiting a bimodal
glycosyl donor equipped with C2-o-TsNHbenzyl ether (TAB), which enables
stereocontrolled synthesis of both α- and β-glycosides by switching reaction
conditions.
