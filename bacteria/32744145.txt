Current combination therapies elicit high response rates in B cell malignancies, 
often using CD20 antibodies as the backbone of therapy. However, many patients
eventually relapse or develop progressive disease. Therefore, novel CD20
antibodies combining multiple effector mechanisms were generated. To study
whether neutrophil-mediated destruction of B cell malignancies can be added to
the arsenal of effector mechanisms, we chimerized a panel of five previously
described murine CD20 antibodies to the human IgG1, IgA1 and IgA2 isotype. Of
this panel, we assessed in vitro antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and direct cell death induction
capacity and studied the efficacy in two different in vivo mouse models. IgA
antibodies outperformed IgG1 antibodies in neutrophil-mediated killing in vitro, 
both against CD20-expressing cell lines and primary patient material. In these
assays, we observed loss of CD19 with both IgA and IgG antibodies. Therefore, we 
established a novel method to improve the assessment of B-cell depletion by CD20 
antibodies by including CD24 as a stable cell marker. Subsequently, we
demonstrated that only IgA antibodies were able to reduce B cell numbers in this 
context. Additionally, IgA antibodies showed efficacy in both an intraperitoneal 
tumor model with EL4 cells expressing huCD20 and in an adoptive transfer model
with huCD20-expressing B cells. Taken together, we show that IgA, like IgG, can
induce ADCC and CDC, but additionally triggers neutrophils to kill (malignant) B 
cells. We conclude that antibodies of the IgA isotype offer an attractive
repertoire of effector mechanisms for the treatment of CD20-expressing
malignancies.
