Sixty years ago Professor Nico Swellengrebel wrote his famous book 'Malaria in
the Netherlands' (Swellengrebel and de Buck, 1938). At that time tertian malaria 
was still endemic, with its epidemic ups and downs. Malaria disappeared as
recently as 1960 and the Rockefeller Foundation (RF) contributed substantially to
this effect. The Rockefeller Archives proved a valuable source of anecdotal
information, which puts the scientific publications of the Dutch malariologists
in a more vivid perspective. Following the course of history, first the already
existing links with the RF are explained along with some peculiarities of tertian
malaria in the Dutch temperate climate. The emergence of a new epidemic during
the war years and the implication of new tools and principles for control as
advocated by the RF are described. The subsequent shriveling of the vector
population and the disappearance of malaria are presented, along with some
details about the reluctance of WHO to declare the Netherlands malaria-free.
Finally, recent unrest about possible return of malaria is put into perspective.
