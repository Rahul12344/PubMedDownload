Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the principal stimulator of host defense against
gram-negative bacteria. LPS-binding protein (LBP),
bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), and soluble CD14 (sCD14) bind
LPS and regulate its toxicity. Lipoarabinomannan, a cell wall component of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resembles LPS with respect to induction of
inflammatory responses through recognition by LBP and sCD14. LBP, BPI, and sCD14 
were measured in serum of 124 patients with tuberculosis in various stages of
disease, in persons who had been in close contact with patients with contagious
pulmonary tuberculosis, and in healthy controls. Levels of these LPS
toxicity-regulating proteins were elevated in patients with active tuberculosis
compared with those in contacts and controls and declined during treatment. The
levels of LBP and sCD14 were higher in patients with fever and anorexia.
LPS-regulating proteins may play a role in host defense during tuberculosis,
presumably through interaction with lipoarabinomannan.
