Ectopic expression of defined transcription factors (TFs) for cell fate handling 
has proven high potential interest in reprogramming differentiated cells, in
particular for regenerative medicine, ontogenesis study and cell based modelling.
Pluripotency or transdifferentiation induction as TF mediated differentiation is 
commonly produced by transfer of genetic information with safety concerns. The
direct delivery of proteins could represent a safer alternative but still needs
significant advances to be efficient. We have successfully developed the direct
delivery of proteins by an attenuated bacterium with a type 3 secretion system
that does not require challenging and laborious steps for production and
purification of recombinant molecules. Here we show that this natural
micro-syringe is able to inject TFs to primary human fibroblasts and cord blood
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. The signal sequence for vectorization of the TF
Oct4 has no effect on DNA binding to its nucleic target. As soon as one hour
after injection, vectorized TFs are detectable in the nucleus. The injection
process is not associated with toxicity and the bacteria can be completely
removed from cell cultures. A three days targeted release of Oct4 or Sox2
embryonic TFs results in the induction of the core pluripotency genes expression 
in fibroblasts and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. This micro-syringe
vectorization represents a new strategy for TF delivery and has potential
applications for cell fate reprogramming.
