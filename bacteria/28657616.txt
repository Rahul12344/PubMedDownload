A t6A nucleoside was efficiently and stereospecifically transformed into a
hydantoin cyclic form of N6-l-threonylcarbamoyladenosine (ct6A) by the use of
polymer bounded carbodiimide (EDC-P) and HOBt. The procedure was successfully
applied for a post-synthetic conversion of t6A-containing RNA 17-mers (of the
sequences of anticodon stem and loop (ASL) fragments of S. pombe tRNAi and E.
coli tRNALys) into the products bearing the ct6A unit.
