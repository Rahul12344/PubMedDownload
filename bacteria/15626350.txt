In this review we report recent findings of our lab showing that Mycoplasma
pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae are present in higher amount, associated with
adventitial inflammation and positive vessel remodeling, in thrombosed coronary
artery segments (CAS) of patients who died due to acute myocardial infarction.
CD8T cell was the predominant lymphocytes in the plaque and CD24(B) cell in the
adventitia. The mean numbers of lymphocytes were significantly higher in
adventitia than in the plaque. Vulnerable plaques were usually associated with
focal positive vessel remodeling and large lipidic atheromas. Mycoplasma is the
only bacterium that needs cholesterol for proliferation. We hypothesized that the
association of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae increases virulence
of both bacteria, inducing inflammation and rupture of the plaque. The search of 
CMV and Helicobacter pylori resulted negative.
