BACKGROUND: Neuronal injury in pneumococcal meningitis is a consequence of
microglial activation and direct toxicity by bacterial products and systemic
inflammation.
METHODS: The treatment effect of the TEPC-15 antibody recognizing teichoic and
lipoteichoic acids was investigated in murine microglial cells and in a rabbit
model of pneumococcal meningitis.
RESULTS: In vitro, the TEPC-15 antibody recognizing teichoic and lipoteichoic
acids increased Streptococcus pneumoniae phagocytosis by murine microglial cells.
In rabbit ceftriaxone-treated S. pneumoniae meningitis, intracisternal TEPC-15
reduced the density of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (116 ± 
70 vs. 221 ± 132/mm(2); p = 0.03). Cerebrospinal fluid inflammatory parameters
(protein, lactate, leukocytes, prostaglandins) were not reduced in
TEPC-15-treated rabbits.
CONCLUSION: Intracisternal treatment with the TEPC-15 antibody reduced neuronal
damage probably by promoting rapid phagocytosis of bacterial products.
