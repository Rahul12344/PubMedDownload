Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) are chemical building blocks for industries, and are 
mainly produced via the petrochemical pathway. However, the anaerobic
fermentation (AF) process gives a potential alternative to produce these organic 
acids using renewable resources. For this purpose, waste streams, such as
microalgae biomass, might constitute a cost-effective feedstock to obtain VFAs.
The present review is intended to summarize the inherent potential of microalgae 
biomass for VFA production. Different strategies, such as the use of
pretreatments to the inoculum and the manipulation of operational conditions (pH,
temperature, organic loading rate or hydraulic retention time) to promote VFA
production from different microalgae strains, are discussed. Microbial structure 
analysis using microalgae biomass as a substrate is pointed out in order to
further comprehend the roles of bacteria and archaea in the AF process. Finally, 
VFA applications in different industry fields are reviewed.
