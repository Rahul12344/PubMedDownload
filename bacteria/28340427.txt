Antimicrobial peptides are small peptides that play important roles in a host's
innate immune response. As an important antimicrobial peptide, β-defensin widely 
distribute in mammals, insects and plants with broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity. In this study, the β-defensin gene of the channel catfish, Ictalurus
punctatus, was cloned, sequenced, and subjected to a bioinformatic analysis. The 
β-defensin gene of the channel catfish contains three exons and two introns, and 
encodes a precursor peptide consisting of two domains: a signal peptide of 24
amino acid residues and a mature peptide of 43 amino acid residues. The mature
peptide is estimated to have a molecular mass of 7.1kDa and a theoretical
isoelectric point of 8.21. Channel catfish β-defensin (ccBD) has six conserved
cysteine residues, forming three disulfide bridges at C1-C5, C2-C4, and C3-C6,
and a β-sheet in the predicted three-dimensional structure. A phylogenetic
analysis suggests that ccBD belongs to the type 1 β-defensins. Real-time
quantitative PCR showed that channel catfish β-defensin transcripts are
constitutively expressed in various tissues in healthy fish, with highest
expression in the skin. The expression of ccBD in vivo increased significantly in
the head kidney (2.9-fold), gill (2.2-fold), and skin (6.6-fold) at 48h after
bacterial (Edwardsiella ictaluri) challenge. In vitro, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 
a bacterial mimic, induced significant changes in ccBD expression in leukocytes
from the spleen (3.4-fold) and head kidney (3.9-fold) 24h after stimulation.
Chemically synthesized ccBD displayed marked inhibitory activity against a broad 
range of bacteria. These results suggest that ccBD is involved in the innate
antibacterial defenses of the channel catfish.
