Notes from the field: Botulism caused by consumption of commercially produced
potato soups stored improperly--Ohio and Georgia, 2011.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In January and April 2011, CDC provided antitoxin for treatment of two persons
with toxin type A botulism associated with consumption of potato soup produced by
two companies. On January 28, 2011, an Ohio resident, aged 29 years, was
hospitalized after 5 days of progressive dizziness, blurred vision, dysphagia,
and difficulty breathing. The patient required mechanical ventilation and
botulism antitoxin. On January 18, he had tasted potato soup from a bulging
plastic container, noted a bad taste, and discarded the remainder. The soup had
been purchased on December 7, 2010, from the refrigerated section of a local
grocer, but it had been kept unrefrigerated for 42 days. He was hospitalized for 
57 days and then was transferred with residual weakness to a rehabilitation
facility.
