BACKGROUND: Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is a life-threatening complication
occurring after intensive chemotherapy; however, no data are available on NE
development after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). The aim of this 
study was to determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of NE after
high-dose chemotherapy and autologous SCT (autoSCT).
METHODS: A total of 297 adult patients who qualified for autoSCT with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, and acute
myeloid leukemia were analyzed. Patients were conditioned with carmustine,
etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan (BEAM); melphalan alone; or busulfan and
cyclophosphamide (BuCy2), and transplanted with peripheral blood or bone marrow
CD34(+) cells. Diagnosis of NE was established in case of neutropenic fever,
abdominal pain or diarrhea, and bowel wall thickening >4 mm on abdominal
sonography.
RESULTS: Neutropenic infections occurred in 262 patients (88%). NE was diagnosed 
in 32 patients (12%), a median +3 (1-5) days after SCT. Bloodstream infections
were present in 18 patients, with gram-negative bacteria in 11 patients. All
patients were treated conservatively with carbapenems and total parenteral
nutrition with bowel rest. The course of disease was complicated by ileus or
septic shock in 9 patients, and was fatal for 3 (9.6%) patients. In univariate
analysis, the initial diagnosis of NHL (P = 0.017) and conditioning with BEAM (P 
= 0.043) had prognostic value. In multivariate analysis, only initial diagnosis
of NHL (P = 0.017) had prognostic significance.
CONCLUSIONS: NE is a rare but severe complication in patients undergoing autoSCT.
Gram-negative bacteria remain the main causative pathogen. Abdominal sonography
allows early diagnosis and treatment, effective in most of patients without
surgery. In our analysis, NE was seen more often in NHL patients treated with a
BEAM regimen.
