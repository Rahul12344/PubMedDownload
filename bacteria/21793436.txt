Salmonellosis is a common food-borne illness in humans caused by
Salmonella-contaminated poultry and their products. In hatcheries, 110 Salmonella
isolates were identified, mostly from first enrichment, and few from delayed
enrichment. The Salmonella prevalence in goose and duck hatcheries was higher
when measured by four multiplex PCR methods than by traditional culture (73.8%
vs. 44.35%, P < 0.05); 97.3% of 110 isolates were Salmonella Potsdam of serogroup
C1 and other isolates were Salmonella Montevideo of C1 and Salmonella Albany of
C2. Plasmid and pulsed field gel electrophoresis genetic analysis revealed that
isolates from duck hatcheries were more diverse than those from goose hatcheries.
In Salmonella Potsdam, host species-specific genotypes were observed in geese for
genotypes 3, 4, and 5 and in ducks for genotypes 7, 8, and 9, suggesting that
Salmonella Potsdam may evolve into goose- and duck-specific isolates. An
examination of 1121 eggs found that only Salmonella Potsdam was identified in
1.8% (7/591) of eggs from chickens fed on the ground, not housed in cages, and in
egg content (6/7) as well as eggshell membrane (1/7). In conclusion, Salmonella
Potsdam may be a major Salmonella infection in waterfowl and chicken eggs.
