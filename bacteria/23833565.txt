The Natural Killer Group 2D (NKG2D) receptor plays an important role in
protecting the host from infections and cancer. By recognizing ligands induced on
infected or tumor cells, NKG2D modulates lymphocyte activation and promotes
immunity to eliminate ligand-expressing cells. Because these ligands are not
widely expressed on healthy adult tissue, NKG2D ligands may present a useful
target for immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer. Novel therapies targeting
NKG2D ligands for the treatment of cancer have shown preclinical success and are 
poised to enter into clinical trials. In this review, the NKG2D receptor and its 
ligands are discussed in the context of cancer, infection, and autoimmunity. In
addition, therapies targeting NKG2D ligands in cancer are also reviewed.
