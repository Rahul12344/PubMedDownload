Blood transfusion given before renal transplantation has been shown to have a
powerful immune modulating effect on recipient response to kidney allograft. The 
mechanism responsible for this effect is still unknown. Here it is assumed that, 
due to incompatibility for HLA-A related class I antigens between blood donor and
recipient, pretransplant blood transfusion may allospecifically induce in the
recipient the generation of T cells that have a suppressive effect on T
lymphocyte response to incompatible HLA class II antigens present on kidney
allograft. Although in many respects this interpretation is still speculative, it
is in accord with findings reported from clinical and experimental studies of the
effect on graft survival of blood transfusion, both random and donor specific.
