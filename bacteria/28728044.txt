In this paper we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate the surface
morphology of Escherichia coli, after being subjected to decontamination
treatments, at sub-MICs levels (minimal inhibitory concentrations), with
different disinfectants used in hospitals, pharmaceutical, food industry and even
in our home, as an essential means to prevent the spreading of microorganisms.
This article focuses on different morphological modifications adopted by E. coli 
cells as responses to the different modes of action of these substances. For
high-resolution AFM images bacterial cells were immobilized on mica (Muscovite)
disks. Each kind of treatment induces its distinct morphological changes, due to 
different mechanisms of action.
