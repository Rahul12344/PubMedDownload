Thymic induction of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells relies on CD28
costimulation and high-affinity T-cell receptor (TCR) signals, whereas Foxp3
(forkhead box P3) induction on activated peripheral CD4(+) T cells is inhibited
by these signals. Accordingly, the inhibitory molecule CTLA-4 (cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte antigen 4) promoted, but was not essential for CD4(+) T-cell Foxp3
induction in vitro. We show that CTLA-4-deficient cells are equivalent to
wild-type cells in the thymic induction of Foxp3 and maintenance of Foxp3
populations in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, but their accumulation in
the colon, where Treg cells specific for commensal bacteria accumulate, is
impaired. In a T cell-transfer model of colitis, the two known CTLA-4 ligands,
B7-1 and B7-2, had largely redundant roles in inducing inflammation and promoting
Treg cell function. However, B7-2 proved more efficient than B7-1 in inducing
Foxp3 in vitro and in vivo. Our data reveal an unappreciated role for CTLA-4 in
establishing the Foxp3(+) compartment in the intestine.
