HLA-G and HLA-E are nonclassical human MHC class I molecules, which promote
tolerance to NK cytotoxicity. MICA and MICB are known to enhance the functions of
NK and T cells. However, the expression of these molecules has never been
investigated in liver cancer. Using RT-PCR and western blot, we aimed to identify
the expression of HLA-G, HLA-E, MICA and MICB in a panel of 41 tissues dissecting
from liver cancer patients in China. HLA-G mRNA was expressed in 8 of 41 Human
Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) specimens and in 1 adjacent normal hepatocellular 
tissue. The expression of HLA-G protein was found in 7 of the 8 HLA-G
mRNA-positive HCC tissues. HLA-E mRNA was up-regulated in 56% HCC specimens but
the expression of HLA-E protein was only upregulated in 29% HCC tissues in
comparison with their adjacent normal counterpart. MICA and MICB mRNA was
decreased in 5% and 8% HCC specimens, while the expression of their proteins
decreased in 21% and 24% HCC tissues. These results suggested that the
expressions of HLA-G, HLA-E, MICA and MICB were differently up-regulated in HCC
tissues. Furthermore, HLA-E and MICA/B genes showed obviously distinctive
expression pattern at transcription and translation level.
