Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) are the undifferentiated melanocytic cells of the
mammalian hair follicle (HF) responsible for recurrent generation of a large
number of differentiated melanocytes during each HF cycle. HF McSCs reside in
both the CD34+ bulge/lower permanent portion (LPP) and the CD34- secondary hair
germ (SHG) regions of the HF during telogen. Using Dct-H2BGFP mice, we separate
bulge/LPP and SHG McSCs using FACS with GFP and anti-CD34 to show that these two 
subsets of McSCs are functionally distinct. Genome-wide expression profiling
results support the distinct nature of these populations, with CD34- McSCs
exhibiting higher expression of melanocyte differentiation genes and with CD34+
McSCs demonstrating a profile more consistent with a neural crest stem cell. In
culture and in vivo, CD34- McSCs regenerate pigmentation more efficiently whereas
CD34+ McSCs selectively exhibit the ability to myelinate neurons. CD34+ McSCs,
and their counterparts in human skin, may be useful for myelinating neurons in
vivo, leading to new therapeutic opportunities for demyelinating diseases and
traumatic nerve injury.
