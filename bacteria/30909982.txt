Infections with Bartonella bacilliformis result in Carrion's disease in humans.
In the first phase of infection, the pathogen causes a hemolytic fever ("Oroya
fever") with case-fatality rates as high as ~90% in untreated patients, followed 
by a chronical phase resulting in angiogenic skin lesions ("verruga peruana").
Bartonella bacilliformis is endemic to South American Andean valleys and is
transmitted via sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.). Humans are the only known reservoir 
for this old disease and therefore no animal infection model is available. In the
present review, we provide the current knowledge on B. bacilliformis and its
pathogenicity factors, vectors, possible unknown reservoirs, established and
potential infection models and immunological aspects of the disease.
