Investigating HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR and -Dw antigens and MLR, CML, and PLT
reactivity in two unrelated persons, it was found that, despite their HLA-D/DR
identity, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) could be induced in the CML assay. The
HLA-DP antigens proved to provide the proliferative impetus for the generation of
CTL.
