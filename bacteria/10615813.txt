Urinary tract infections are accounted to serious complications, particularly in 
pregnancy complicated by diabetes. In this paper, cases of pregnancy have been
analysed, affected by diabetes of type 1 and type 2, according to status of
metabolic control and the type of urinary tract infection. In a group of 217
diabetic pregnant women, the incidence of urinary tract infections was 26.7%,
19.0% of them being recurrent. In the group with bad metabolic control,
infections were statistically more frequent (17.4% vs. 37.3%, p = 0.001);
bacteriuria without clinical demonstrations 10.4% vs. 19.6% (p > 0.05),
pyelonephritis (7.0% vs. 17.7%, p = 0.001). The following types of pathogenic
bacteria were found: E. coli--44.4%, Staphylococcous--28.9%,
Enterococcocus--18.7%. A high frequency of Gram (+) bacteria was observed. A good
metabolic control without chronic diabetic complications correlated with less
frequent infections of the urinary tract.
