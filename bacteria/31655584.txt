BACKGROUND: α-Amylases specifically catalyse the hydrolysis of the internal α-1, 
4-glucosidic linkages of starch. Glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 13 is the main
α-amylase family in the carbohydrate-active database. Lactobacillus plantarum
WCFS1 possesses eleven proteins included in GH13 family. Among these, proteins
annotated as maltose-forming α-amylase (Lp_0179) and maltogenic α-amylase
(Lp_2757) were included.
RESULTS: In this study, Lp_0179 and Lp_2757 L. plantarum α-amylases were
structurally and biochemically characterized. Lp_2757 displayed structural
features typical of GH13_20 subfamily which were absent in Lp_0179. Genes
encoding Lp_0179 (Amy2) and Lp_2757 were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia 
coli BL21(DE3). Purified proteins showed high hydrolytic activity on
pNP-α-D-maltopyranoside, being the catalytic efficiency of Lp_0179 remarkably
higher. In relation to the hydrolysis of starch-related carbohydrates, Lp_0179
only hydrolysed maltopentaose and dextrin, demonstrating that is an exotype
glucan hydrolase. However, Lp_2757 was also able to hydrolyze cyclodextrins and
other non-cyclic oligo- and polysaccharides, revealing a great preference towards
α-1,4-linkages typical of maltogenic amylases.
CONCLUSIONS: The substrate range as well as the biochemical properties exhibited 
by Lp_2757 maltogenic α-amylase suggest that this enzyme could be a very
promising enzyme for the hydrolysis of α-1,4 glycosidic linkages present in a
broad number of starch-carbohydrates, as well as for the investigation of an
hypothetical transglucosylation activity under appropriate reaction conditions.
