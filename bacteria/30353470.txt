Acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) seriously affects patient quality of life. We
explored the role of the intestinal microbiota on oxidative stress and autophagy 
in stroke, and Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) reversed the changes induced by
intestinal microbiota. We determined the characteristics of the intestinal
microbiota of AIS and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients by 16S sequencing
and found that the structure and diversity of the intestinal microbiota in
patients with AIS and TIA were significantly different from those in healthy
subjects. Specifically, the abundance of genus Bifidobacterium, Megamonas,
Blautia, Holdemanella, and Clostridium, content of homocysteine and triglyceride 
was increased significantly, thus it may be as a potential mechanism of AIS and
TIA. Furthermore, germ-free mice were infused intracolonically with fecal
supernatants of TIA and AIS with/without feed AS-IV for 12 weeks, and we found
that the feces of AIS up-regulated the autophagy markers Beclin-1, light chain 3 
(LC3)-II and autophagy-related gene (Atg)12, and the expression of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and NADPH oxidase 2/4 (NOX2/4), malondialdehyde (MDA),
however, the expression of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and activity of
superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) was down-regulated in brain
tissue, the content of homocysteine and free fatty acids (FFA) in serum of the
mice. Meanwhile, AS-IV could reverse the above phenomenon, however, it does not
affect the motor function of mice. AS-IV reversed these changes and it may be a
potential drug for AIS therapeutics.
