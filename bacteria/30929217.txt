Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the commonest bacteria that cause morbidity
and mortality in children and the elderly. The two extremes of age and
individuals with underlying disease are particularly at risk of developing
pneumococcalÂ disease. The pneumococcus is responsible for a wide range of
infectious diseases, ranging from mild, non-invasive infections such as otitis
media and sinusitis, to more severe infections including pneumonia, septicemia,
and meningitis. Despite the licensure of highly effective pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines, the control of pneumococcal disease is still challenging. Here we
describe the critical role of Streptococcus pneumoniae in public health.
