Objectives: Paediatric and adolescent patients in need of allogeneic
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) generally receive stem cells from
older, unrelated or parental donors when a sibling donor is not available.
Despite encouraging clinical outcomes, it has been suggested that immune
reconstitution accompanied by increased replicative stress and a large difference
between donor and recipient age may worsen immunosenescence in paediatric
recipients.
Methods: In this study, paired samples were collected at the same time from
donors and recipients of haploidentical haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HaploSCT). We then conducted flow cytometry-based phenotypic and functional
analyses and telomere length (TL) measurements of 21 paired T-cell sets from
parental donors and children who received T-cell-replete HaploSCT with
post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy).
Results: Senescent T cells, CD28- or CD57+ cells, were significantly expanded in 
patients. Further, not only CD4+CD28- T cells, but also CD4+CD28+ T cells showed 
reduced cytokine production capacity and impaired polyfunctionality compared with
parental donors, whereas their TCR-mediated proliferation capacity was
comparable. Of note, the TL in patient T cells was preserved, or even slightly
longer, in senescent T cells compared with donor cells. Regression analysis
showed that senescent features of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients were
influenced by donor age and the frequency of CD28- cells, respectively.
Conclusion: Our data suggest that in paediatric HaploSCT, premature
immunosenescent changes occur in T cells from parental donors, and therefore,
long-term immune monitoring should be conducted.
