This study sought to explore the effect of staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
on autophagy in mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and then influence
osteogenesis through the change of autophagy. C3H10T1/2 cells were induced by
osteogenic medium with the treatment of LTA at different concentrations (1, 5,
10 μg/mL); 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were used as the autophagy inhibitor, and
rapamycin (rapamycin, Rap) were used to activate autophagy; the effects on
osteogenesis were detected by alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red
staining, real-time quantitative PCR, and western blotting; autophagic activity
was investigated by the expression of LC3-Ⅱand p62 proteins. Compared with
control group, the expression of osteogenesis markers was significantly
up-regulated with the LTA treatment on the mRNA and protein level; the positive
rate of alkaline phosphatase was enhanced in the LTA groups; and the formation of
calcium nodules was increased simultaneously. The expression of LC3-Ⅱ protein was
increased in LTA groups, while the expression of p62 protein was decreased.
Inhibition of autophagy significantly reduced the effect of LTA on osteogenesis
of MSCs; the promotion of LTA on osteogenic differentiation was further enhanced 
when adding rapamycin to activate autophagic activity. It provides new insight of
prevention and treatment for bone infection.
