RATIONALE: We hypothesised that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) can be clustered based on concentrations of plasma biomarkers and that the
thereby identified biological phenotypes are associated with mortality.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with ARDS were included in this prospective
observational cohort study. Cluster analysis of 20 biomarkers of inflammation,
coagulation and endothelial activation provided the phenotypes in a training
cohort, not taking any outcome data into account. Logistic regression with
backward selection was used to select the most predictive biomarkers, and these
predicted phenotypes were validated in a separate cohort. Multivariable logistic 
regression was used to quantify the independent association with mortality.
RESULTS: Two phenotypes were identified in 454 patients, which we named
'uninflamed' (N=218) and 'reactive' (N=236). A selection of four biomarkers
(interleukin-6, interferon gamma, angiopoietin 1/2 and plasminogen activator
inhibitor-1) could be used to accurately predict the phenotype in the training
cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve: 0.98, 95% CI
0.97 to 0.99). Mortality rates were 15.6% and 36.4% (p<0.001) in the training
cohort and 13.6% and 37.5% (p<0.001) in the validation cohort (N=207). The
'reactive phenotype' was independent from confounders associated with intensive
care unit mortality (training cohort: OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.23; validation
cohort: OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.31).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ARDS can be clustered into two biological phenotypes, 
with different mortality rates. Four biomarkers can be used to predict the
phenotype with high accuracy. The phenotypes were very similar to those found in 
cohorts derived from randomised controlled trials, and these results may improve 
patient selection for future clinical trials targeting host response in patients 
with ARDS.
