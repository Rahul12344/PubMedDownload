A novel non-dsrAB (without dissimilatory sulfite reductase genes)
sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Clostridium sp. BXM was isolated from a paddy
soil. Incubation experiments were then performed to investigate the formation of 
reduced sulfur compounds (RSC) by Clostridium sp. BXM, and RSC-induced
dechlorination of p,p'-DDT in culture medium and soil solution. The RSCs produced
were 5.8 mM and 4.5 mM in 28 mM sulfate amended medium and soil solution
respectively after 28-day cultivation. The p,p'-DDT dechlorination ratios were
74% and 45.8% for 5.8mM and 4.5 mM RSCs respectively at 6h. The metabolites of
p,p'-DDT found in the two reaction systems were identified as p,p'-DDD and
p,p'-DDE. The dechlorination pathways of p,p'-DDT to p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE were
proposed, based on mass balance and dechlorination time-courses. The results
indicated that RSC-induced natural dechlorination may play an important role in
the fate of organochlorines.
