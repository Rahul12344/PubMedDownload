Human exposure to arsenic in drinking water is known to contribute to many
different health outcomes such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiopulmonary disease. 
Several epidemiological studies suggest that T cell function is also altered by
drinking water arsenic exposure. However, it is unclear how individual responses 
differ to various levels of exposure to arsenic. Our laboratory has recently
identified differential responses of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(HPMBC) T cells as measured by polyclonal T cell activation by mitogens during
sodium arsenite exposure. T cells from certain healthy individuals exposed to
various concentrations (1-100 nM) of arsenite in vitro showed a dose-dependent
suppression at these extremely low concentrations (∼ 0.1-10 ppb) of arsenite,
whereas other individuals were not suppressed at low concentrations. In a series 
of more than 30 normal donors, two individuals were found to be sensitive to low 
concentration (10 nM equivalent ∼ 1 ppb drinking water exposure) to sodium
arsenite-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation produced by
phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and anti-CD3/anti-CD28. In an arsenite-susceptible
individual, arsenite suppressed the activation of Th1 (Tbet) cells, and decreased
the percentage of cells in the double positive Th17 (RORγt) and Treg (FoxP3)
population. While the majority of normal blood donors tested were not susceptible
to inhibition of proliferation at the 1-100 nM concentrations of As(+3), it was
found that all donors were sensitive to suppression by 100 nM monomethylarsonous 
acid (MMA+3), a key metabolite of arsenite. Thus, our studies demonstrate for the
first time that low ppb-equivalent concentrations of As(+3) are immunosuppressive
to HPBMC T cells in some individuals, but that most donor HPBMC are sensitive to 
suppression by MMA(+3) at environmentally relevant exposure levels.
