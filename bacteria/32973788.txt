Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a risk factor for COPD. Our previous study
revealed more severe emphysema in COPD patients (mostly smokers) with prior
tuberculosis. However, the mechanisms of interactions between cigarette smoke
(CS) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are unknown. In this study, we found
that the frequencies of both M1 and M2 macrophages, and levels of MMP9 and MMP12 
in bronchoalveolar lavage were increased in PTB patients with smoking.
Between-group analysis showed that the frequency of M1 macrophages was higher in 
non-smoker PTB patients while more M2 macrophages were found in smokers without
PTB, as compared to the non-smoker healthy controls. Bacille Calmette-Guérin
(BCG) infection in CS extract (CSE)-incubated MH-S cells further enhanced
secretion of M1-related (iNOS, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and M2-related (TGF-β and IL-10) 
cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cellular apoptosis,
concomitantly with up-regulation of MMP9 and MMP12, but not TIMP1. Moreover, BCG 
infection in acutely CS-exposed mice promoted macrophage polarization toward both
M1 and M2 phenotypes, along with increased lung inflammatory infiltration. MMP9
and MMP12, but not TIMP1, were further up-regulated in lung tissues and BAL fluid
after BCG infection in this model. Taken together, Mtb Infection promoted
CS-exposed macrophages to polarize toward both M1 and M2 phenotypes, along with
enhanced production of MMP9 and MMP12. These findings provide insights into the
mechanistic interplay between CS exposure and tuberculosis in the pathogenesis of
COPD.
