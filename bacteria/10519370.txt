The frequency of each A*10 allele was determined in 5 major United States ethnic 
populations randomly selected from a pool containing 82,979 unrelated
individuals. The phenotype frequency of A10 was 10.5% in Caucasians, 14.0% in
African-Americans, 21.1% in Asians/Pacific Islanders, 10.6% in Hispanics, and
9.8% in Native Americans. Fifty-nine individuals who had at least one A10 antigen
were randomly chosen from each ethnic group for polymerase chain reaction using
sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes (PCR-SSOP) typing. Thirteen of sixteen
known A10 alleles were identified in this pool. The most common alleles observed 
were: A*2601 in Caucasians (55%), Hispanics (58%), and Native Americans (45%);
A*3402 in African-Americans (34%); and A*3401 in Asians/Pacific Islanders (61%). 
The African-American and Asian/Pacific Islander populations differ from all other
populations in the distribution of A*10 alleles, particularly, A*2601, A*3401,
and A*3402.
