Older adults, especially men and/or those with diabetes, hypertension and/or
obesity, are prone to severe COVID-19. In some countries, older adults,
particularly those residing in nursing homes, have been prioritised to receive
COVID-19 vaccines due to high risk of death. In very rare instances,the COVID-19 
vaccines can induce anaphylaxis, and the management of anaphylaxis in older
people should be considered carefully. An ARIA-EAACI-EuGMS (Allergic Rhinitis and
its Impact on Asthma, European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, and
European Geriatric Medicine Society)Working Group has proposed some
recommendations for older adults receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. Anaphylaxis to 
COVID-19 vaccines is extremely rare (from 1 per 100,000 to 5 per million
injections). Symptoms are similar in younger and older adults but they tend to be
more severe in the older patients. Adrenaline is the mainstay treatment and
should be readily available. A flowchart is proposed to manage anaphylaxis in the
older patients.
