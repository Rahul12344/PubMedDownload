Increase of phagocytic activity and new appearance of a C4b (guinea pig)
recognizing capability in peritoneal macrophages from Corynebacterium parvum and 
thioglycollate-stimulated mice.

Wellek B, Kessel G, Loos M, Hahn H.

Activated mouse macrophages displayed enhanced phagocytic activity towards
particles opsonized with IgG antibody and homologous C3. In addition, they were
able to recognize guinea pig C4b. It is concluded that activated macrophages
develop phagocytically active receptors for heterologous C4b.
