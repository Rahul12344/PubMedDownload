T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling is initiated by recruiting ZAP-70 to the
cytosolic part of TCR. ZAP-70, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, is composed of an 
N-terminal tandem SH2 (tSH2) domain connected to the C-terminal kinase domain.
The ZAP-70 is recruited to the membrane through binding of tSH2 domain and the
doubly phosphorylated ITAM motifs of CD3 chains in the TCR complex. Our results
show that the tSH2 domain undergoes a biphasic structural transition while
binding to the doubly phosphorylated ITAM-ζ1 peptide. The C-terminal SH2 domain
binds first to the phosphotyrosine residue of ITAM peptide to form an encounter
complex leading to subsequent binding of second phosphotyrosine residue to the
N-SH2 domain. We decipher a network of noncovalent interactions that
allosterically couple the two SH2 domains during binding to doubly phosphorylated
ITAMs. Mutation in the allosteric network residues, for example, W165C, uncouples
the formation of encounter complex to the subsequent ITAM binding thus explaining
the altered recruitment of ZAP-70 to the plasma membrane causing autoimmune
arthritis in mice. The proposed mechanism of allosteric coupling is unique to
ZAP-70, which is fundamentally different from Syk, a close homolog of ZAP-70
expressed in B-cells.
