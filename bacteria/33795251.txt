New therapeutic options for patients with ovarian cancer are urgently needed.
Therefore, we evaluated the efficacy of two second-generation mesothelin
(MSLN)-directed CAR T cells in orthotopic mouse models of ovarian cancer.
Treatment with CAR T cells expressing an MSLN CAR construct including the CD28
domain (M28z) significantly prolonged survival, but no persistent tumor control
was observed. Despite lower response rates, MSLN-4-1BB (MBBz) CAR T cells induced
long-term remission in some SKOV-3-bearing mice. Tumor-infiltrating M28z and MBBz
CAR T cells upregulated PD-1 and LAG-3 in an antigen-dependent manner while MSLN+
tumor cells expressed the corresponding ligands (PD-L1 and HLA-DR), demonstrating
the co-inhibitory pathways impede CAR T cell persistence in the ovarian tumor
microenvironment. Furthermore, profiling plasma soluble factors identified a
cluster of M28z and MBBz-treated mice characterized by elevated T cell secreted
factors that had increased survival, higher CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration, less 
exhausted CAR T cell phenotypes, and increased HLA-DR expression by tumor cells. 
Altogether, our study demonstrates the therapeutic potential of MSLN-CAR T cells 
to treat ovarian cancer.
