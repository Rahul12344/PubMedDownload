Expression vectors have been constructed for a region of the human retinoic acid 
receptor-alpha (hRAR-alpha) and transferred into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC)
cells. When the vectors are overexpressed in F9 cells, clones can be selected for
resistance to retinoic acid-induced differentiation. This effect is obtained even
when the hRAR-alpha region is expressed as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein.
Using the beta-galactosidase component of the fusion protein as a marker,
overexpression of the fusion protein has been correlated with the retinoic
acid-resistance effect. The clones resistant to retinoic acid no longer exhibit
the normal retinoic acid induction of endo B cytokeratin, laminin B-1, and tissue
plasminogen activator mRNAs observed with normal F9 cells. Retinoic acid
induction of type IV alpha-1 collagen and Hox-1.3 RNAs is observed with these
clones. When transfected with a thyroid receptor DNA-binding sequence
(TRE)/thymidine kinase promoter/luciferase construct, the retinoic acid-resistant
clones do not yield the same retinoic acid-induced level of luciferase obtained
with F9 cells. It is hypothesized that the RAR vectors are interfering with
endogenous RAR(s) in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit retinoic acid-induced 
differentiation of F9 EC cells.
