The heritability of lifespan is 20-30%, but only a few genes associated with
longevity have been identified. To explain this discrepancy, the inheritance of
epigenetic features, such as DNA methylation, have been proposed to contribute to
the heritability of lifespan.We investigated whether parental lifespan is
associated with DNA methylation profile in nonagenarians. A regression model,
adjusted for differences in blood cell proportions, identified 659 CpG sites
where the level of methylation was associated with paternal lifespan. However, no
association was observed between maternal lifespan and DNA methylation. The 659
CpG sites associated with paternal lifespan were enriched outside of CpG islands 
and were located in genes associated with development and morphogenesis, as well 
as cell signaling. The largest difference in the level of methylation between the
progeny of the shortest-lived and longest-lived fathers was identified for CpG
sites mapping to CXXC5. In addition, the level of methylation in three
Notch-genes (NOTCH1, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) was also associated with paternal
lifespan.There are implications for the inheritance of acquired traits via
epigenetic mechanisms in mammals. Here we describe DNA methylation features that 
are associated with paternal lifespan, and we speculate that the identified CpG
sites may represent intergenerational epigenetic inheritance.
