Tuberculous meningitis (TM) is a severe complication of tuberculosis that mainly 
occurs during childhood. No murine models are available to study this disease.
The purpose of the present study was to develop a murine model to investigate the
pathogenesis of TM. Mice were intracerebrally injected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Bacilli could be cultured from brain homogenates, and, on
histopathological examination, all mice were found to have meningeal cellular
infiltration. We found elevated levels of chemoattractants for mononuclear
phagocytes and neutrophilic granulocytes. This is the first murine model for TM
that can be used for research on the host response to TM, in particular the
innate immune response.
