The intestinal mucosa of Crohn disease (CD) patients is abnormally colonized by
adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). Upon AIEC infection, autophagy is induced in
host cells to restrain bacterial intracellular replication. The underlying
mechanism, however, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the
EIF2AK4-EIF2A/eIF2α-ATF4 pathway in the autophagic response to AIEC infection. We
showed that infection of human intestinal epithelial T84 cells with the AIEC
reference strain LF82 activated the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway, as evidenced by
increased phospho-EIF2AK4, phospho-EIF2A and ATF4 levels. EIF2AK4 depletion
inhibited autophagy activation in response to LF82 infection, leading to
increased LF82 intracellular replication and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine
production. Mechanistically, EIF2AK4 depletion suppressed the LF82-induced ATF4
binding to promoters of several autophagy genes including MAP1LC3B, BECN1,
SQSTM1, ATG3 and ATG7, and this subsequently inhibited transcription of these
genes. LF82 infection of wild-type (WT), but not eif2ak4(-/-), mice activated the
EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway, inducing autophagy gene transcription and autophagy
response in enterocytes. Consequently, eif2ak4(-/-) mice exhibited increased
intestinal colonization by LF82 bacteria and aggravated inflammation compared to 
WT mice. Activation of the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway was observed in ileal
biopsies from patients with noninflamed CD, and this was suppressed in inflamed
CD, suggesting that a defect in the activation of this pathway could be one of
the mechanisms contributing to active disease. In conclusion, we show that
activation of the EIF2AK4-EIF2A-ATF4 pathway upon AIEC infection serves as a host
defense mechanism to induce functional autophagy to control AIEC intracellular
replication.
