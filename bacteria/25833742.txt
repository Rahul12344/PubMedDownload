BACKGROUND/AIMS: Probiotic strains have been recognized to exert important roles 
in many biological systems, including immune response, growth, development and
reproduction. However, to date, no studies have focused either on the relation
among probiotics and maternal factors or on probiotics' ability to qualitatively 
and/or quantitatively modulate maternal transcripts.
METHODS: In this study, the effects of Lactobacillus rhamnosus administered to
parental fish on the control of maternal factors involved in autophagic,
apoptotic and dorsalizing processes during zebrafish embryo development were
assessed through q-PCRs, WMISH and TUNEL assay.
RESULTS: The results we obtained show that probiotic induced significant changes 
in both maternal and zygotic mRNA levels involved in embryo development. The
maternal autophagy-regulating genes herein investigated--ambra1a, ambra1b,
beclin, lc3-, as well as those involved in the apoptotic process--caspase3, bcl2,
bax--were modulated in disfavor and favor of the treated group, respectively.
Also, the key transcripts ruling the dorsalizing process--goosecoid and
chordin--were subject to a significant regulation of their gene expression.
CONCLUSION: The results we acquired demonstrated that parentally administered
Lactobacillus rhamnosus is able to modulate important physiological processes
involved in zebrafish embryo development.
