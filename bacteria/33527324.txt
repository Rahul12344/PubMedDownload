Ex vivo expansion of human cord blood (CB) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is one
approach to overcome limited numbers of HSCs in single CB units. However, there
is still no worldwide acceptable HSC ex vivo expansion system. A main reason is
that we still have very limited knowldege regarding mechanisms underlying
maintenance and expansion of CB HSCs. Here we report that retinoid X receptor
(RXR) activity is of significance for CB HSC ex vivo expansion. RXR antagonist
HX531 significantly promoted ex vivo expansion of CB HSCs and progenitor cells
(HPCs). RXR agonist Bexarotene notably suppressed ex vivo expansion of CB HSCs.
Activation of RXR by Bexarotene significantly blocked expansion of phenotypic
HSCs and HPCs and expressed increased functional HPCs as assessed by colony
formation induced by UM171 and SR1. In vivo transplantation experiments in
immune-deficient mice demonstrated that HX531 expanded CB HSCs possess long-term 
reconstituting capacities, and Bexarotene treatment inhibited expansion of
functional CB HSCs. RNA-seq analysis revealed that RXR regulates expression of
FBP1 (a negative regulator of glucose metabolism) and many genes involved in
differentation. ECAR analysis showed that HX531 significantly promoted glycolytic
activity of CB CD34+ HSCs and HPCs. Our studies suggest that RXR is a negative
regulator of ex vivo expansion of CB HSCs and HPCs.
