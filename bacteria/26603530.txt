INTRODUCTION: Fractalkine is a chemokine implicated as a mediator in a variety of
inflammatory conditions. Knowledge of fractalkine release in patients presenting 
with infection to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is highly limited. The primary
objective of this study was to establish whether plasma fractalkine levels are
elevated in sepsis and associate with outcome. The secondary objective was to
determine whether fractalkine can assist in the diagnosis of infection upon ICU
admission.
METHODS: Fractalkine was measured in 1103 consecutive sepsis patients (including 
271 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)) upon ICU admission and at
days 2 and 4 thereafter; in 73 ICU patients treated for suspected CAP in whom
this diagnosis was refuted in retrospect; and in 5 healthy humans intravenously
injected with endotoxin.
RESULTS: Compared to healthy volunteers, sepsis patients had strongly elevated
fractalkine levels. Fractalkine levels increased with the number of organs
failing, were higher in patients presenting with shock, but did not vary by site 
of infection. Non-survivors had sustained elevated fractalkine levels when
compared to survivors. Fractalkine was equally elevated in CAP patients and
patients treated for CAP but in whom the diagnosis was retrospectively refuted.
Fractalkine release induced by intravenous endotoxin followed highly similar
kinetics as the endothelial cell marker E-selectin.
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma fractalkine is an endothelial cell derived biomarker that,
while not specific for infection, correlates with disease severity in sepsis
patients admitted to the ICU.
