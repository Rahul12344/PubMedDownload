We report NMR studies of transient hydrogen bonding in a polysaccharide (PS)
dissolved in water without cosolvent at ambient temperature. The PS portion of
the Escherichia coli O142 lipopolysaccharide is comprised of repeating
pentasaccharide units of GalNAc (N-acetyl galactosamine), GlcNAc (N-acetyl
glucosamine), and rhamnose in a 3:1:1 ratio, respectively. A 105-ns molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation on one pentasaccharide repeat unit predicts transient
inter-residue hydrogen bonds from the GalNAc NH groups in the PS. To investigate 
these predictions experimentally, the PS was uniformly ¹³C,¹⁵N enriched and the
NH, carbonyl, C2, C4, and methyl resonances of the GalNAc and GlcNAc residues
assigned using through-bond triple-resonance NMR experiments. Temperature
dependence of amide NH chemical shifts and one-bond NH J couplings support that
NH groups on two of the GalNAc residues are donors in transient hydrogen bonds.
The remaining GalNAc and GlcNAc NHs do not appear to be donors from either
temperature-dependent chemical shifts or one-bond NH J couplings. These results
substantiate the presence of weak or partial hydrogen bonds in carbohydrates, and
that MD simulations of repeating units in PSs provide insight into overall PS
structure and dynamics.
