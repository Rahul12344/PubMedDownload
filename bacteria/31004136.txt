BACKGROUND: Following programmatic introduction of the 13-valent pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV13), there is residual carriage and disease due to
PCV13-covered serotypes.
METHODS: PCV13-immunized children aged 13-48 months, N = 988, were enrolled
between February 2014 and August 2015 ("late PCV13"), and had nasopharyngeal
pneumococcal carriage compared with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV7) immunized children, N = 567, enrolled between November 2010 and September 
2011 ("early PCV13"). Nasopharyngeal pneumococci were molecular-serotyped by
microarray. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases were identified through
enhanced national surveillance.
RESULTS: Compared with PCV7-immunized children, carriage among PCV13-immunized
children was significantly lower for serotypes 19A (odds ratio [OR], 0.08 [95%
confidence interval {CI}, .02-.25]), 6C (OR, 0.11 [95% CI, .03-.32]), and 7F (8
vs 0 cases). IPD incidence in children <5 years was significantly lower for
serotypes 1 (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.03 [95% CI, 0-.19]) and 7F (IRR, 0.13 
[95% CI, .05-.36]) but not 19A (IRR, 0.6 [95% CI, .3-1.12]) or serotype 3 (IRR,
2.3 [95% CI, .86-6.15]) in the late PCV13 period than in the early PCV13 period. 
The most significant rises in IPD incidence were for serotypes 8, 12F, and 24F.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV13 has reduced serotype 19A carriage among vaccinated children.
We found no impact of PCV13 on serotype 3 carriage or disease, and emergence of
non-PCV13-serotype disease.
