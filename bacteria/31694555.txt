BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) especially in the elderly is a serious
disease, with a worse prognosis.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. A total of 405 patients with
definite IE were divided into three groups: 205 patients under 50 years old, 141 
patients between 50 and 64 years old and 59 patients over 65 years old.
RESULTS: For older patients, clinical symptoms such as fever, anemia, and heart
murmur were as common as the younger patients. IE in old patients had more
frequent nosocomial origin (P = 0.007) and tended to be more frequent with bad
oral hygiene (p = 0.008). The most frequent isolated pathogens in the old groups 
was streptococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci. The old patients had a
lower operation rate (40.7% vs 58.9% vs 62.4%, P = 0.012) and higher in-hospital 
mortality (20.3% vs 10.6% vs 8.8%, P = 0.044) compared with the younger patients.
Surgical treatment was a significant predictor of one-year mortality even after
adjusting for the confounders (HR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.027-10.598, P = 0.009). The
one-year survival rate was higher for older patients with surgical intervention
than those without (95.8% vs 68.6%, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with IE presented with more comorbidities, bad oral
hygiene, more nosocomial origin and a more severe prognosis than younger
patients. Streptococci was the most frequent micro-organisms in this group.
Surgery were underused in old patients and those with surgical treatment had
better prognosis.
