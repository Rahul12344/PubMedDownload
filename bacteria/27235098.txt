It is tempting to look at bacteria from our human egocentric point of view and
label them as either 'good' or 'bad'. However, a microbial society has its own
system of government - 'microcracy' - and its own rules of play. Lactic acid
bacteria are often referred to as representatives of the good ones, and there is 
little doubt that those belonging to the normal intestinal flora are beneficial
for human health. But we should stop thinking of lactic acid bacteria as always
being 'friendly' - they may instead behave like fledgling cuckoos.
