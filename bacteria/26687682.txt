The molecular basis by which receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) recruit and
phosphorylate Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing substrates has remained
elusive. We used X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and cell-based assays
to demonstrate that recruitment and phosphorylation of Phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), a
prototypical SH2 containing substrate, by FGF receptors (FGFR) entails formation 
of an allosteric 2:1 FGFR-PLCγ complex. We show that the engagement of
pTyr-binding pocket of the cSH2 domain of PLCγ by the phosphorylated tail of an
FGFR kinase induces a conformational change at the region past the cSH2 core
domain encompassing Tyr-771 and Tyr-783 to facilitate the binding/phosphorylation
of these tyrosines by another FGFR kinase in trans. Our data overturn the current
paradigm that recruitment and phosphorylation of substrates are carried out by
the same RTK monomer in cis and disclose an obligatory role for receptor
dimerization in substrate phosphorylation in addition to its canonical role in
kinase activation.
