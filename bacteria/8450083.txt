This study describes activation of serum complement by lipoteichoic acid (LTA)
from Streptococcus mutans OMZ 176, while in solution. Serum from 16 healthy
students was taken. Test samples were incubated with increasing doses (1-5,000
micrograms/ml) of LTA or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli 0111:B4
for 1 h at 37 degrees C; then assayed for degradation of C3, C4 or factor B by
crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Each preparation caused a significant (p < 0.05)
dose-dependent conversion of C3. The response curves obtained were not
statistically different. LPS was a stronger activator of the alternative pathway 
than LTA, as judged from analysis of C3 degradation in the presence of Mg2+/EGTA,
and from their effects on factor B cleavage. LTA caused, however, pronounced
alterations in the shape of C4 precipitation in the gels. Functional (hemolytic) 
assays showed that, when tested at 200 micrograms/ml, LTA and LPS triggered
significant (p < 0.05) consumptions of both classical and alternative pathway
proteins. LPS was a significantly (p < 0.05) stronger activator than LTA.
Apparently, the C3 degradation found for this LTA involved the alternative
pathway to a small extent; thus some other mechanism of fluid-phase C3 cleavage
seemed also to be operative.
