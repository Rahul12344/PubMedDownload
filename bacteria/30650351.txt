Fanconi anemia (FA) is characterized by developmental abnormalities, bone marrow 
failure, and cancer predisposition. FA cells are hypersensitive to DNA
replicative stress and accumulate co-transcriptional R-loops. Here, we use the
Damage At RNA Transcription assay to reveal colocalization of FANCD2 with R-loops
in a highly transcribed genomic locus upon DNA damage. We further demonstrate
that highly purified human FANCI-FANCD2 (ID2) complex binds synthetic
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and R-loop substrates with high affinity, preferring 
guanine-rich sequences. Importantly, we elucidate that human ID2 binds an R-loop 
structure via recognition of the displaced ssDNA and ssRNA but not the RNA:DNA
hybrids. Finally, a series of RNA and R-loop substrates are found to strongly
stimulate ID2 monoubiquitination, with activity corresponding to their binding
affinity. In summary, our results support a mechanism whereby the ID2 complex
suppresses the formation of pathogenic R-loops by binding ssRNA and ssDNA
species, thereby activating the FA pathway.
