AIMS: This comparative study investigated the occurrence of cadF, cj1349, ciaB,
pldA, tlyA, hecA, hecB, mviN, irgA and IroE genes in 212 Arcobacter butzleri
isolated from three different environmental sites linked to the dairy chain
(farms, industrial and artisanal dairy plants) located in three Italian regions
(Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Calabria).
METHODS AND RESULTS: According to the presence of these genes, different
pathotypes (P-types) were determined. The main genes detected were ciaB, mviN,
tlyA, cj1349, pldA and cadF, while the least common genes were iroE, hecA, hecB
and irgA. TlyA, irgA, hecA, hecB and iroE, which were significantly more frequent
in isolates recovered in industrial dairy plants. Twelve P-types were detected.
The occurrence of the most frequently detected P-types (P-types 1, 2, 3 and 5)
differed significantly (P < 0·001) in relation to both the environmental site and
geographical area of isolation. The highest diversity in P-types was observed in 
industrial dairy plants and in the Calabria region.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show a correlation between the occurrence 
of putative virulence genes and virulence genotype variability depending on the
environmental site and geographical origin of the isolates.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study provides insights into
the similar distribution of putative virulence genes in a dairy chain and other
sources' isolates and also into a geographical distribution of some P-types. We
have shown that industrial dairy plants may represent an environmental site
favouring a selection of the isolates with a higher pathogenetic pattern.
