Pre-treatment of fermentation brines from green olives has been carried out by
the Fe(II)/Fe(III)/H(2)O(2) system. Reagent concentration exerted a positive
influence on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal. Hydrogen peroxide uptake
showed values in the range 0.3-1.6mol of COD eliminated per mol of H(2)O(2)
consumed depending on operating conditions. The optimum working pH was found to
be in the interval 2.0-3.5. Reaction temperature increased the COD degradation
rate, although similar COD conversion values were obtained after 5h of treatment 
regardless of the value of this parameter. An analysis of the biodegradability of
this type of effluent demonstrated the beneficial effect of the chemical
pre-oxidation. According to the experimental results, it is suggested that there 
is an inhibitory effect of the wastewater due to its COD content and nature
rather than attributable to the presence of high amounts of sodium chloride.
Biodegradation efficiency increased as temperature was raised up to 30 degrees C.
A further increase of this parameter up to 40 degrees C resulted in the death of 
the microorganisms.
