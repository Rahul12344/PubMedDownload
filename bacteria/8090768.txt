An Escherichia coli expression system has been developed to produce milligram
quantities of the variable domains of a human T-cell receptor from a cytotoxic T 
cell that recognizes the HLA-A2-influenza matrix peptide complex as a single
polypeptide chain. The recombinant protein was purified by metal-chelate
chromatography and then refolded in a redox buffer system. The refolded protein
was shown to directly bind both Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B and the major
histocompatibility complex protein-peptide complex using a BIAcore biosensor.
Thus this preparation of a single-chain, variable-domain, T-cell receptor
fragment can bind both of its natural ligands and some of it is therefore a
functional fragment of the receptor molecule.
