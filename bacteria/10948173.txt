Gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo are shown to constitutively express
the peptide antibiotic human beta-defensin type 1 (hBD-1). In contrast, hBD-2
expression is regulated in gastric epithelial cells and increases in response to 
infection with Helicobacter pylori or stimulation with the proinflammatory
cytokine interleukin-1. These data suggest that hBD-2 is a component of the
regulated host gastric epithelial cell response to H. pylori infection and
proinflammatory mediators.
