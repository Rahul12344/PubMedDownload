In general, mortality rates associated with systemic fungal infections have not
improved much in more than a decade, although the number of antifungal agents
available for the treatment of serious fungal infections has increased in the
past few years. A possible approach to decreasing mortality rates associated with
fungal infections may be to treat patients with combinations of different classes
of antifungals. Recently, in vitro and animal studies evaluating different
combinations of antifungal agents have demonstrated important synergistic and/or 
additive activity against many genera of fungi. However, prudence is required,
because some antifungal combinations have demonstrated antagonistic activity.
Well-controlled clinical trials are still necessary to define the most
efficacious antifungal combination. In addition, these clinical trials should
evaluate the adverse event profile of the combination regimens, as well as their 
pharmacoeconomic impact.
