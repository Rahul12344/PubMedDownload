BACKGROUND: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a blood disorder caused by a point
mutation on the beta globin gene resulting in the synthesis of abnormal
hemoglobin. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) reduces disease severity, but the levels vary 
from one individual to another. Most research has focused on common genetic
variants which differ across populations and hence do not fully account for HbF
variation.
METHODS: We investigated rare and common genetic variants that influence HbF
levels in 14 SCD patients to elucidate variants and pathways in SCD patients with
extreme HbF levels (≥7.7% for high HbF) and (≤2.5% for low HbF) in Tanzania. We
performed targeted next generation sequencing (Illumina_Miseq) covering exonic
and other significant fetal hemoglobin-associated loci, including BCL11A, MYB,
HOXA9, HBB, HBG1, HBG2, CHD4, KLF1, MBD3, ZBTB7A and PGLYRP1.
RESULTS: Results revealed a range of genetic variants, including bi-allelic and
multi-allelic SNPs, frameshift insertions and deletions, some of which have
functional importance. Notably, there were significantly more deletions in
individuals with high HbF levels (11% vs 0.9%). We identified frameshift
deletions in individuals with high HbF levels and frameshift insertions in
individuals with low HbF. CHD4 and MBD3 genes, interacting in the same
sub-network, were identified to have a significant number of pathogenic or
non-synonymous mutations in individuals with low HbF levels, suggesting an
important role of epigenetic pathways in the regulation of HbF synthesis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights in selecting essential variants and
identifying potential biological pathways associated with extreme HbF levels in
SCD interrogating multiple genomic variants associated with HbF in SCD.
