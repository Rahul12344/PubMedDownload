Lyme disease is a debilitating infection that is caused upon a bite of Borrelia
burgdorferi (Bb)-infected ticks. One of the most prominent clinical
manifestations is the development of chronic Lyme arthritis. Months after Bb
infection, approximately 60% of untreated Lyme patients experience intermittent
arthritic attacks that may last for years. The use of the CD28(-/-) mouse in Bb
infection has helped to shed light into the mechanisms that govern this
inflammatory process, which seems to be tightly regulated. In this current
review, the effect of immunoregulation, as well as CD28 deficiency in the
development of chronic Lyme arthritis is discussed.
