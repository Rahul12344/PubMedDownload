The MSI2 RNA-binding protein is a potent oncogene playing key roles in
haematopoietic stem cell homeostasis and malignant haematopoiesis. Here we
demonstrate that MSI2 is expressed in the intestinal stem cell compartment, that 
its expression is elevated in colorectal adenocarcinomas, and that MSI2
loss-of-function abrogates colorectal cancer cell growth. MSI2 gain-of-function
in the intestinal epithelium in a drug-inducible mouse model is sufficient to
phenocopy many of the morphological and molecular consequences of acute loss of
the APC tumour suppressor in the intestinal epithelium in a Wnt-independent
manner. Transcriptome-wide RNA-binding analysis indicates that MSI2 acts as a
pleiotropic inhibitor of known intestinal tumour suppressors including Lrig1,
Bmpr1a, Cdkn1a and Pten. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of the
PDK-AKT-mTORC1 axis rescues oncogenic consequences of MSI2 induction. Taken
together, our findings identify MSI2 as a central component in an unappreciated
oncogenic pathway promoting intestinal transformation.
