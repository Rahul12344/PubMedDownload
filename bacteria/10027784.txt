The frequency of each A*28 allele was determined by PCR-SSOP typing in 5 major
U.S. ethnic populations: Caucasians, African Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders,
Hispanics, and Native Americans. The percent of serologically defined
A28-positive individuals in the 5 populations ranged from 2.7-17.9%. Fifty-nine
individuals who were previously serologically typed as A28, A68 or A69 were
randomly chosen for allele-level typing from each ethnic group from a database of
82,979 consecutively typed unrelated individuals. The most common A*28 allele for
Caucasians, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans was
A*68012, while A*6802 was found in the majority of African Americans. Only four
and three A*28 alleles were seen in Caucasians and African Americans,
respectively, while five to six A*28 alleles were seen in the other population
groups. The A*6804 and A*6806 alleles were not observed in any of the five ethnic
groups.
