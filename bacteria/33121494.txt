BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis is an immune-mediated disease of the central
nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, oligodendrocytes loss,
demyelination, and damaged axons. Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK belong to a family of
receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate innate immune responses and CNS
homeostasis. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mRNA
expression of MerTK, Gas6, and Axl significantly increase, whereas Tyro3 and
ProS1 remain unchanged. We have shown that Gas6 is neuroprotective during EAE,
and since Gas6 activation of Axl may be necessary for conferring neuroprotection,
we sought to determine whether α-Axl or α-MerTK antibodies, shown by others to
activate their respective receptors in vivo, could effectively reduce
inflammation and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Mice received either α-Axl, α-MerTK, IgG isotype control, or PBS before 
the onset of EAE symptoms. EAE clinical course, axonal damage, demyelination,
cytokine production, and immune cell activation in the CNS were used to determine
the severity of EAE.
RESULTS: α-Axl antibody treatment significantly decreased the EAE clinical
indices of female mice during chronic EAE and of male mice during both acute and 
chronic phases. The number of days mice were severely paralyzed also
significantly decreased with α-Axl treatment. Inflammatory macrophages/microglia 
and the extent of demyelination significantly decreased in the spinal cords of
α-Axl-treated mice during chronic EAE, with no differences in the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. α-MerTK antibody did not influence EAE induction or
progression.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that the beneficial effect of Gas6/Axl signaling
observed in mice administered with Gas6 can be partially preserved by
administering an activating α-Axl antibody, but not α-MerTK.
