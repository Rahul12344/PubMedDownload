guinea pigs immunized against tularemia].

The activities of NADP-oxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in
mononuclear phagocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) during the
phagocytosis of Francisella tularensis and the influence of immunization of on
the activity of oxygen-dependent metabolism were studied. The phagocytosis of
F.tularensis was found to be accompanied by a rise in the activity of
NADP.H-oxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In the process of
immunogenesis the rearrangement of the enzymatic system ensuring the
antimicrobial action of phagocytes occurred. Macrophages exhibited higher
enzymatic activity than PML.
