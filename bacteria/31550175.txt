Complement factor B/C2 family (Bf/C2F) proteins are core complement system
components in vertebrates that are absent in invertebrates and have been lost by 
numerous species, raising evolutionary questions. At least 3 duplication events
have occurred from Cnidaria (ancestor) to mammals. Type II Bf/C2 genes appeared
during separation of Proterostomia and Deuterostomes. The second event occurred
during separation of vertebrates and invertebrates, yielding type II-2 Bf/C2. The
third event occurred when jawed and jawless fish were separated, eventually
producing Bf and C2 genes. Herein, we report the second mollusc Sinonovacula
constricta Bf/C2-type gene (ScBf). ScBf is similar to Ruditapes decussatus
Bf-like because both lack the first complement control protein module at the N
terminus present in mammalian Bf/C2 proteins. Uniquely, the Ser protease (SP)
module at the C terminus of ScBf is âˆ¼50 aa longer than in other complement factor
B/C2-type (Bf/C2T) proteins, and is Glu-rich. Bf/C2T proteins in molluscs lack
the catalytic Ser in the SP module. Surprisingly, ScBf regulates rabbit
erythrocyte agglutination, during which it is localized on the erythrocyte
surface. Thus, ScBf may mediate the agglutination cascade and may be an upstream 
regulator of this process. Our findings provide new insight into the origin of
the Bf/C2F.-Peng, M., Li, Z., Niu, D., Liu, X., Dong, Z., Li, J. Complement
factor B/C2 in molluscs regulates agglutination and illuminates evolution of the
