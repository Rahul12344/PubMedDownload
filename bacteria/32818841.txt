Aberrantly activated kinase signaling pathways drive invasion and dissemination
in medulloblastoma (MB). A majority of tumor-promoting kinase signaling pathways 
feed into the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) extracellular regulated
kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. The activation status of ERK1/2 during invasion of MB
cells is not known and its implication in invasion control unclear. We
established a synthetic kinase activation relocation sensor (SKARS) for the MAPK 
ERK1/2 pathway in MB cells for real-time measuring of drug response. We used 3D
invasion assays and organotypic cerebellum slice culture to test drug effects in 
a physiologically relevant tissue environment. We found that hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF) caused rapid nuclear ERK1/2 activation in MB cells, which persisted for
several hours. Concomitant treatment with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib 
completely repressed nuclear ERK1/2 activity induced by HGF and EGF but not by
bFGF. Increased nuclear ERK1/2 activity correlated positively with speed of
invasion. Dasatinib blocked ERK-associated invasion in the majority of cells, but
we also observed fast-invading cells with low ERK1/2 activity. These ERK1/2-low, 
fast-moving cells displayed a rounded morphology, while ERK-high fast-moving
cells displayed a mesenchymal morphology. Dasatinib effectively blocked
EGF-induced proliferation while it only moderately repressed tissue invasion,
indicating that a subset of cells may evade invasion repression by dasatinib
through non-mesenchymal motility. Thus, growth factor-induced nuclear activation 
of ERK1/2 is associated with mesenchymal motility and proliferation in MB cells
and can be blocked with the BCR/ABL kinase inhibitor dasatinib.
