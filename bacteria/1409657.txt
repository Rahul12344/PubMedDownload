The arsenic resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 consists of 
three genes, arsR (encoding the repressor regulatory protein), arsB (the
determinant of the membrane efflux protein that confers resistance by pumping
arsenic from the cells), and arsC (the small gene whose protein product is
required for arsenate resistance only, not for arsenite resistance). ArsC has now
been shown to be an arsenate reductase, converting intracellular arsenate [As(V)]
to arsenite [As(III)], which is then exported from the cells by an
energy-dependent efflux process. The arsenate reductase activity was found in the
soluble cytoplasmic fraction in Escherichia coli (and not associated with the
periplasmic fraction or the sedimentable cell envelope). Purified ArsC protein
coupled in vitro with thioredoxin plus dithiothreitol (but not 2-mercaptoethanol 
or reduced glutathione) to reduce arsenate to arsenite.
