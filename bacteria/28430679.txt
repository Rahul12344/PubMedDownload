OBJECTIVE: This study included women attending primary health care units in
Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, to assess the cervicovaginal levels of human
β-defensin (hBD) 1, 2, 3, and 4 during Chlamydia trachomatis infection.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cervicovaginal samples were collected for Pap testing and
assessing the presence of infection by C. trachomatis, human papillomavirus,
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Vaginal smears were taken to
evaluate local microbiota. Human β-defensin levels were determined using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cervicovaginal fluid samples. Seventy-four
women with normal vaginal microbiota and no evidence of infection were included
in hBD quantification assays; 37 tested positive for C. trachomatis and 37 were
negative. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Women positive for C. trachomatis had significantly lower cervicovaginal
hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 compared with those who tested negative (hBD-1: 0 pg/mL
[0-2.1] vs 1.6 pg/mL [0-2.4], p < .0001; hBD-2: 0 pg/mL [0-3.9] vs 0.61 pg/mL
[0-8.9], p = .0097; and hBD-3: 0 pg/mL [0-4.3] vs 0.28 pg/mL [0-8.4], p = .0076).
Human β-defensin 4 was not detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 in cervicovaginal fluid were
detected in the presence of C. trachomatis infection.
