AIMS: To examine the modulation of the interacting partners of the calcineurin
(CaN)-NFAT pathway in T cells during Cryptococcus neoformans fungal infection and
post-T11TS immunotherapy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Wistar rats were infected with C. neoformans and followed by
immunotherapy with immune-potentiator T11TS. T cells were analysed by flow
cytometry, immunoblotting and nuclear translocation study. The signalling
proteins LCK, FYN, LAT, PLCγ1 and CaN in T cells were regulated by C. neoformans 
infection resulting in reduced nuclear translocation of NFAT and IL-2 expression.
Following T11TS immunotherapy, the expressions of the above-mentioned proteins
were boosted and thus resulting in the clearance of C. neoformans from lung and
spleen.
CONCLUSIONS: The precise mechanism of suppression of the T-cell function by C.
neoformans is still unknown. Previously, we have shown that T11TS positively
regulates the function of T cells to abrogate glioma and other immunosuppressive 
conditions. T11TS immunotherapy increased the expression of the above signalling 
partners of the CaN-NFAT pathway in T cells and improved nuclear retention of
NFAT. As a result, an increased IL-2 expression leads to activation and
proliferation of T cells.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results demonstrate the role of T11TS
in restoring the CaN-NFAT signalling pathway in T cells. It identifies T11TS as
an immunotherapeutic agent with potential clinical outcomes to counteract C.
neoformans infection.
