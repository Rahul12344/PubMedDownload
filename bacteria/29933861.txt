BACKGROUND: Cytokines are fundamental elements in mediating and stimulating the
immune response against tuberculosis (TB). Growing evidence indicated that
polymorphisms in the interleukin-17 (IL-17) A and F genes are implicated in TB.
OBJECTIVES: This meta-analysis was aimed to re-evaluate and update the
relationship between IL-17A rs2275913 G/A and IL17F rs763780 T/C polymorphisms
and TB risk.
METHODS: Using inclusive searches of the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science 
and Elsevier Science Direct, we identified outcome data from all articles
estimating the association between IL-17 A and F polymorphisms and TB risk.
RESULTS: A total of 15 studies comprising 7130 patients and 7540 controls were
included. Our pooled analysis demonstrated that the IL-17A rs2275913 G/A SNP was 
not associated with the risk of TB in overall, or in Asians and Caucasians, but
it conferred resistance to TB in Latin Americans using allele (OR=0.53),
codominant (OR=0.53 and 0.38), dominant (OR=0.49) and recessive (OR=0.46)
inheritance models. For IL-17F rs763780 T/C, the pooled evidence indicated that
this variation was a risk factor for TB in allele (C vs T) and dominant (TC+CC vs
TT) models in overall (OR of 1.35) and among Asians (OR=1.40), but not in
Caucasians.
CONCLUSION: In summary, our meta-analysis suggested that the IL-17A rs2275913 was
a protective factor against TB, but -17F rs763780 T/C was a risk factor for TB.
