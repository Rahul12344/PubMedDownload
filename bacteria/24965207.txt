BACKGROUND: We previously reported on subtypes of polypoidal choroidal
vasculopathy (PCV), and categorized PCV as polypoidal choroidal
neovascularization (CNV) and typical PCV. The aim of this study was to clarify
whether complement component 2 (C2) and complement factor B (CFB) genotypes are
associated with subtypes of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, such as polypoidal
CNV and typical PCV.
METHODS: First, we categorized 677 patients into typical age-related macular
degeneration (tAMD; 250 patients), PCV (376) and retinal angiomatous
proliferation (RAP; 51). Second, we categorized 282 patients with PCV as having
polypoidal CNV (84 patients) or typical PCV (198) based on indocyanine green
angiographic findings. In total, 274 subjects without AMD, such as PCV and CNV,
served as controls. A SNP (rs547154) in the C2 gene and three SNPs (rs541862,
rs2072633, rs4151667) in the CFB gene were genotyped, and case-control studies
were performed in subjects with these PCV subtypes.
RESULTS: In tAMD, no SNPs were associated with allele distributions. In PCV,
rs547154 and rs2072633 were associated with allele distributions. RAP was only
associated with rs2072633. After logistic regression analysis with adjustment for
confounding factors, tAMD, PCV and RAP were found to be associated with
rs2072633.As to PCV subtypes, there were significant differences in the
distributions of rs547154, rs541862 and rs2072633 in the case-control studies for
polypoidal CNV, but not between the typical PCV and control groups. Logistic
regression analysis with adjustment for confounding factors showed the
distributions of rs547154, rs541862 and rs2072633 to differ significantly between
the controls and polypoidal CNV cases and that these SNPs were protective. The
A/A genotype of rs2072633 was significantly more common in the polypoidal CNV
than in the typical PCV group (p = 0.03), even with adjustment for polyp number
and greatest linear dimension.
CONCLUSIONS: PCV might be genetically divisible into polypoidal CNV and typical
PCV. The C2 and CFB gene variants were shown to be associated with polypoidal
CNV. Typical PCV was not associated with variants in these genes.
