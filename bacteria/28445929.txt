Kif7 is a ciliary kinesin motor protein that regulates mammalian Hedgehog pathway
activation through influencing structure of the primary cilium. Here we show that
Kif7 is required for normal T-cell development, despite the fact that T-cells
lack primary cilia. Analysis of Kif7-deficient thymus showed that Kif7-deficiency
increases the early CD44+CD25+CD4-CD8- thymocyte progenitor population but
reduces differentiation to CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) cell. At the transition 
from DP to mature T-cell, Kif7-deficiency selectively delayed maturation to the
CD8 lineage. Expression of CD5, which correlates with TCR signal strength, was
reduced on DP and mature CD4 and CD8 cells, as a result of thymocyte-intrinsic
Kif7-deficiency, and Kif7-deficient T-cells from radiation chimeras activated
less efficiently when stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 in vitro.
Kif7-deficient thymocytes showed higher expression of the Hedgehog target gene
Ptch1 than WT, but were less sensitive to treatment with recombinant Shh, and
Kif7-deficient T-cell development was refractory to neutralisation of endogenous 
Hh proteins, indicating that Kif7-deficient thymocytes were unable to interpret
changes in the Hedgehog signal. In addition, Kif7-deficiency reduced cell-surface
MHCII expression on thymic epithelial cells.
