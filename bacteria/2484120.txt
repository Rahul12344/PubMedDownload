We studied the importance of changes in plasma protein concentrations in patients
with hematologic systemic diseases treated by selective decontamination of the
digestive tract. The concentrations of albumin, acute-phase proteins,
immunoglobulins and fibronectin were determined by laser nephelometry in 125
serum samples of eight patients. Results obtained allow the following
conclusions: 1. There was a correlation between the clinical condition and
concentrations of acid alpha-1-glycoprotein, IgG, CRP and fibronectin. These
concentrations might be important for assessment of the course of the disease,
effectiveness of therapy and the detection of pathogenetic relations. 2. The acid
alpha-1-glycoprotein is of particular importance since relations exist between
changes in its concentration and therapeutic results as well as the prognosis of 
the disease.
