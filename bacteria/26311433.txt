Using our previously reported maps of the electrostatic surface of horse heart
ferri- and ferro-cyt c, comparisons were made between the complementary
electrostatic surfaces of three cyt c peroxidase-cyt c complexes and the
photosynthetic reaction center-cyt c complex, considering both iron oxidation
states. The results obtained were consistent with a sliding mechanism for the
electron shuttle on the surface of the protein complexes, promoted by the change 
in iron oxidation state. This mechanism was found to be in agreement with
theoretical and NMR studies reported in the literature. Importantly, the analysis
also provided a rationale for recognition of nonproductive associations. As we
have previously reported the same conclusion on examination of redox partners of 
cyt c in the mitochondrial respiratory pathway, our hypothesis is that the
proposed mechanism could represent a general exit strategy of monoheme cyts c and
c2 in electron transfer complexes.
