gammadelta T cells play an important role in regulating the immune response to
stress stimuli; however, the mean by which these innate lymphocytes fulfill this 
function remains poorly defined. The main subset of human peripheral blood
gammadelta T cells responds to nonpeptidic antigens, such as
isopentylpyrophosphate (IPP), a metabolite in the mevalonate pathway for both
eukaryote and prokaryote cells. IPP-primed gammadelta T cells significantly
augment the inflammatory response mediated by monocytes and alphabeta T cells to 
TSST-1, the staphylococcal superantigen that is the major causative agent of
toxic shock syndrome. Here we show that the small pool of activated peripheral
gammadelta T cells induces an early upregulation of CD40 on monocytes and the
local release of High Mobility Group Box-1 (HMGB-1), the molecule designated as
the late mediator of systemic inflammation. This finding provides a new basis for
how gammadelta T cells may serve as influential modulators of both endogenous and
exogenous stress stimuli.
