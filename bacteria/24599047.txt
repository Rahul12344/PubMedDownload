Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is complicated by peritonitis episodes that cause loss
of mesothelium and eventually sclerosing peritonitis. An improved understanding
of the molecular contributors to peritoneal injury and defense may increase the
therapeutic armamentarium to optimize peritoneal defenses while minimizing
peritoneal injury. There is no information on the expression and function of the 
cytokine TWEAK and its receptor Fn14 during peritoneal injury. Fn14 expression
and soluble TWEAK levels were measured in human PD peritoneal effluent cells or
fluids with or without peritonitis. Fn14 expression was also analyzed in
peritoneal biopsies from PD patients. Actions of intraperitoneal TWEAK were
studied in mice in vivo. sTWEAK levels were increased in peritoneal effluent in
PD peritonitis. Effluent sTWEAK levels correlated with the number of peritoneal
macrophages (r=0.491, p=0.002). Potential TWEAK targets that express the receptor
Fn14 include mesothelial cells and macrophages, as demonstrated by flow cytometry
of peritoneal effluents and by analysis of peritoneal biopsies. Peritoneal biopsy
Fn14 correlated with mesothelial injury, fibrosis and inflammation, suggesting a 
potential deleterious effect of TWEAK/Fn14. In this regard, intraperitoneal TWEAK
administration to mice promoted peritoneal inflammation characterized by
increased peritoneal effluent MCP-1, Fn14 and Gr1+ macrophages, increased
mesothelial Fn14, MCP-1 and CCL21 expression and submesothelial tissue macrophage
recruitment. Taken together these data suggest that the TWEAK/Fn14 system may
promote inflammation and tissue injury during peritonitis and PD.
