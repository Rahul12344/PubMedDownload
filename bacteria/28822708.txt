Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide which is
closely related to metastasis. Our previous study has shown that MRTF-A promote
the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells and WDR1 promotes breast cancer cell migration.
But the exact molecular mechanism on metastasis is still not fully understood, we
now report that WDR1 enhanced the effect of MRTF-A induced-MDA-MB-231 cell
migration by promoting the expression of the EMT markers and migration markers
via RhoA-MRTF-A signaling pathway. Importantly, WDR1 promoted the nuclear
importion of MRTF-A by affecting the expression of nuclear transport protein
importin. But WDR1 did not affect the expression of MRTF-A. Interestingly, MRTF-A
promoted the expression of miR-206 via its promoter CArG box but miR-206 inhibits
the migration of breast cancer cells through suppressing the expression of WDR1
and MRTF-A via targeted their 3'UTR. Our data thus provide important and novel
insights into MRTF-A-miR-206-WDR1 form feedback loop to regulate breast cancer
cell migration.
