The spread of multidrug resistant bacteria owing to the intensive use of
antibiotics is challenging current antibiotic therapies, and making the discovery
and evaluation of new antimicrobial agents a high priority. The evaluation of
novel peptide sequences of predicted antimicrobial peptides from different
sources is valuable approach to identify alternative antibiotic leads. Two
strategies were pursued in this study to evaluate novel antimicrobial peptides
from the human β-defensin family (hBD). In the first, a 32-residue peptide was
designed based on the alignment of all available hBD primary structures, while in
the second a putative 35-residue peptide, hBD10, was mined from the gene DEFB110.
Both hBDconsensus and hBD10 were chemically synthesized, folded and purified.
They showed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus
aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but were not hemolytic on human red blood
cells. The NMR-based solution structure of hBDconsensus revealed that it adopts a
classical β-defensin fold and disulfide connectivities. Even though the mass
spectrum of hBD10 confirmed the formation of three disulfide bonds, it showed
limited dispersion in 1 H NMR spectra and structural studies were not pursued.
The evaluation of different β-defensin structures may identify new antimicrobial 
agents effective against multidrug-resistant bacterial strains.
