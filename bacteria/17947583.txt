The complex between the DnaB helicase and the DnaG primase unwinds duplex DNA at 
the eubacterial replication fork and synthesizes the Okazaki RNA primers. The
crystal structures of hexameric DnaB and its complex with the helicase binding
domain (HBD) of DnaG reveal that within the hexamer the two domains of DnaB pack 
with strikingly different symmetries to form a distinct two-layered ring
structure. Each of three bound HBDs stabilizes the DnaB hexamer in a conformation
that may increase its processivity. Three positive, conserved electrostatic
patches on the N-terminal domain of DnaB may also serve as a binding site for DNA
and thereby guide the DNA to a DnaG active site.
