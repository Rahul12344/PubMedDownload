Transketolase (TK) catalyzes a reversible transfer of a two-carbon (C2 ) unit
between phosphoketose donors and phosphoaldose acceptors, for which the
group-transfer reaction that follows a one- or two-electron mechanism and the
force that breaks the C2"-C3" bond of the ketose donors remain unresolved.
Herein, we report ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures of a TK (TKps) from
Pichia stipitis in previously undiscovered intermediate states and support a
diradical mechanism for a reversible group-transfer reaction. In conjunction with
MS, NMR spectroscopy, EPR and computational analyses, it is concluded that the
enzyme-catalyzed non-Kekulé diradical cofactor brings about the C2"-C3" bond
cleavage/formation for the C2 -unit transfer reaction, for which suppression of
activation energy and activation and destabilization of enzymatic intermediates
are facilitated.
