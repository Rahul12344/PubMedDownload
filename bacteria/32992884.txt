The promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is an essential component of nuclear
compartments called PML bodies. This protein participates in several cellular
processes, including growth control, senescence, apoptosis, and differentiation. 
Previous studies have suggested that PML regulates gene expression at a subset of
loci through a function in chromatin remodeling. Here we have studied global gene
expression patterns in mouse embryonic skin derived from Pml depleted and wild
type mouse embryos. Differential gene expression analysis at different
developmental stages revealed a key role of PML in regulating genes involved in
epidermal stratification. In particular, we observed dysregulation of the late
cornified envelope gene cluster, which is a sub-region of the epidermal
differentiation complex. In agreement with these data, PML body numbers are
elevated in basal keratinocytes during embryogenesis, and we observed reduced
epidermal thickness and defective hair follicle development in PML depleted mouse
embryos.
