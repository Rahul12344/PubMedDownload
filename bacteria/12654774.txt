Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a potent cytokine with many different proinflammatory
activities. To study the role of IL-18 in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas
pneumonia, IL-18-deficient (IL-18(-/-)) and wild-type mice were intranasally
inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. IL-18 deficiency was associated with
reduced outgrowth of Pseudomonas in the lungs and diminished dissemination of the
infection. In addition, pulmonary inflammation (histopathology) and levels of
tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-6, and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 in lungs
and plasma were lower in IL-18(-/-) mice. Consistent with results obtained for
IL-18(-/-) mice, treatment of wild-type mice with a neutralizing IL-18 binding
protein-immunoglobulin G Fc fusion construct also attenuated outgrowth of
Pseudomonas compared with that for mice treated with a control protein. These
results demonstrate that the presence of endogenous IL-18 activity facilitates
inflammatory responses in the lung during Pseudomonas pneumonia, concurrently
impairing bacterial clearance.
