Is SIBO A Real Condition?

Ruscio M.

Context: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has gained popularity on
the internet in addition to certain clinical and research circles. This interest 
has expanded awareness of important new dietary, nutraceutical, and
pharmaceutical treatments in addition to laboratory evaluation assessment
options. Concomitantly, there appears a loss of parsimony regarding how to use
these tools resulting in an untenable degree of testing and treatment for this
condition.
Objectives: A balanced review of the data regarding SIBO testing, treatment, and 
management with the goal of establishing non-biased best practices.
Design: Non-systematic review.
Results: The results for the review fall into two categories. Ineffective Action:
Treat only SIBO labs; Treat for SIBO if no symptoms are exhibited; Recommending
eating or avoiding foods because they might be good or bad for SIBO; Recommending
treatments that are non-validated. Effective Action: Use SIBO breath results, in 
addition to history and current symptoms, to determine the best treatment; Find
foods that work for patients based on dietary elimination and reintroduction;
Apply validated treatment for SIBO and IBS in a logical 'step-up' like treatment 
approach.
Conclusions: Testing and treating for SIBO can offer patients clinically
significant relief. However, these tests and treatments must be applied with
circumspection to prevent over-testing, over-treatment, squandering resources, or
creating a fear around certain foods.
