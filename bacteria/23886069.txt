BACKGROUND: The genome of the important industrial host Bacillus subtilis does
not encode the glyoxylate shunt, which is necessary to utilize overflow
metabolites, like acetate or acetoin, as carbon source. In this study, the operon
encoding the isocitrate lyase (aceB) and malate synthase (aceA) from Bacillus
licheniformis was transferred into the chromosome of B. subtilis. The resulting
strain was examined in respect to growth characteristics and qualities as an
expression host.
RESULTS: Our results show that the modified B. subtilis strain is able to grow on
the C2 compound acetate. A combined transcript, protein and metabolite analysis
indicated a functional expression of the native glyoxylate shunt of B.
lichenifomis in B. subtilis. This metabolically engineered strain revealed better
growth behavior and an improved activity of an acetoin-controlled expression
system.
CONCLUSIONS: The glyoxylate shunt of B. licheniformis can be functionally
transferred to B. subtilis. This novel strain offers improved properties for
industrial applications, such as growth on additional carbon sources and a
greater robustness towards excess glucose feeding.
