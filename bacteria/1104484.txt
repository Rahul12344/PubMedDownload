Isolation and purification of two antigenically active, "complimentary"
polypeptide fragments of tetanus neurotoxin.

Matsuda M, Yoneda M.

Tetanus neurotoxin (molecular weight approximately 160,000) was purified from
bacterial extracts (intracellular toxin) and mildly trypsinized and from culture 
filtrates (extracellular toxin). Both purified preparations could be dissociated 
reversibly into two polypeptide chains, with molecular weights of 53,000
(fragment alpha) and 107,000 (fragment beta), by treatment with 100 mM
dithiothreitol (DTT) and 4 M urea with concomitant loss of toxicity. Upon removal
of DDT and urea from the dissociated toxin preparation by dialysis, these
fragments reassociated, forming the whole toxin. The two fragments were isolated 
and purified from the dissociated toxin by gel filtration on an Ultrogel AcA 44
column equilibrated with buffer containing 2 M urea and 1 mM DTT. The preparation
of fragment alpha was nontoxic whereas that of fragment beta was slightly toxic. 
Immunodiffusion analyses, using horse antitoxin, showed that the antigenicities
of fragment alpha and fragment beta were distinct from each other but were
partially identical with that of undissociated toxin. The abilities of these
fragments to precipitate antitoxin were lost on heating at 60 C for 5 min. The
molecular substructure of tetanus neurotoxin is discussed on the basis of these
findings.
