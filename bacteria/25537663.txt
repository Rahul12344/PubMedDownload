Pamamycins are macrodiolides of polyketide origin with antibacterial activities. 
Their biosynthesis has been proposed to utilize succinate as a building block.
However, the mechanism of succinate incorporation into a polyketide was unclear. 
Here, we report identification of a pamamycin biosynthesis gene cluster by
aligning genomes of two pamamycin-producing strains. This unique cluster contains
polyketide synthase (PKS) genes encoding seven discrete ketosynthase (KS) enzymes
and one acyl-carrier protein (ACP)-encoding gene. A cosmid containing the entire 
set of genes required for pamamycin biosynthesis was successfully expressed in a 
heterologous host. Genetic and biochemical studies allowed complete delineation
of pamamycin biosynthesis. The pathway proceeds through 3-oxoadipyl-CoA, a key
intermediate in the primary metabolism of the degradation of aromatic compounds. 
3-Oxoadipyl-CoA could be used as an extender unit in polyketide assembly to
facilitate the incorporation of succinate.
