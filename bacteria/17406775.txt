A web-based resource, Microbial Community Analysis (MiCA), has been developed to 
facilitate studies on microbial community ecology that use analyses of
terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (T-RFLP) of 16S and 18S rRNA
genes. MiCA provides an intuitive web interface to access two specialized
programs and a specially formatted database of 16S ribosomal RNA sequences. The
first program performs virtual polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
rRNA genes and restriction of the amplicons using primer sequences and
restriction enzymes chosen by the user. This program, in silico PCR and
Restriction (ISPaR), uses a binary encoding of DNA sequences to rapidly scan
large numbers of sequences in databases searching for primer annealing and
restriction sites while permitting the user to specify the number of mismatches
in primer sequences. ISPaR supports multiple digests with up to three enzymes.
The number of base pairs between the 5' and 3' primers and the proximal
restriction sites can be reported, printed, or exported in various formats. The
second program, APLAUS, infers a plausible community structure(s) based on T-RFLP
data supplied by a user. APLAUS estimates the relative abundances of populations 
and reports a listing of phylotypes that are consistent with the empirical data.
