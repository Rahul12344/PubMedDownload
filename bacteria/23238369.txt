The IQ-motif is an amphipathic, often positively charged, α-helical, calmodulin
binding sequence found in a number of eukaryote signalling, transport and
cytoskeletal proteins. They share common biophysical characteristics with
established, cationic α-helical antimicrobial peptides, such as the human
cathelicidin LL-37. Therefore, we tested eight peptides encoding the sequences of
IQ-motifs derived from the human cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins IQGAP2 and
IQGAP3. Some of these peptides were able to inhibit the growth of Escherichia
coli and Staphylococcus aureus with minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC)
comparable to LL-37. In addition some IQ-motifs had activity against the fungus
Candida albicans. This antimicrobial activity is combined with low haemolytic
activity (comparable to, or lower than, that of LL-37). Those IQ-motifs with
anti-microbial activity tended to be able to bind to lipopolysaccharide. Some of 
these were also able to permeabilise the cell membranes of both Gram positive and
Gram negative bacteria. These results demonstrate that IQ-motifs are viable lead 
sequences for the identification and optimisation of novel anti-microbial
peptides. Thus, further investigation of the anti-microbial properties of this
diverse group of sequences is merited.
