Relatively simple objective criteria are now available to predict which patients 
are at risk for bad outcomes from community-acquired pneumonia. In general, these
include older patients and those with certain coexisting illnesses (especially
neoplastic disease) or findings of altered mental status, hypotension, severe
tachycardia, tachypnea, fever, acidemia, azotemia, hypoxemia, hyperglycemia,
anemia, or hyponatremia. The major causes of severe pneumonia are S pneumoniae, H
influenzae, and L pneumophila. Less common causes include mixed aerobic and
anaerobic mouth flora, as well as M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, gram-negative
bacilli, and S aureus. Specific diagnosis is hampered by a lack of reliable
diagnostic tests, but Gram's stain of expectorated sputum and cultures of sputum 
and blood may occasionally be helpful. Many empirical treatment regimens have
been recommended, including those of the American Thoracic Society and the
Infectious Diseases Society of America, which are reviewed here. It is hoped that
better diagnostic tools will permit future targeting of microbes with
narrow-spectrum therapy to diminish the risk of selection of resistant strains
with empirical regimens.
