The pqs quorum sensing communication system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa controls
virulence factor production and is involved in biofilm formation, therefore
playing an important role for pathogenicity. In order to attenuate P. aeruginosa 
pathogenicity, we followed a ligand-based drug design approach and synthesized a 
series of compounds targeting PqsR, the receptor of the pqs system. In vitro
evaluation using a reporter gene assay in Escherichia coli led to the discovery
of the first competitive PqsR antagonists, which are highly potent (K(d,app) of
compound 20: 7 nM). These antagonists are able to reduce the production of the
virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa. Our finding offers insights into the
ligand-receptor interaction of PqsR and provides a promising starting point for
further drug design.
