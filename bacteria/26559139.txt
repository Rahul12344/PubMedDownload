BACKGROUND: Brain volume atrophy is observed in relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis (RRMS).
METHODS: Brain volume changes were evaluated in 23 patients with RRMS treated
with interferon β-1a 44 μg given subcutaneously (SC) three times a week (tiw) and
15 healthy controls. Percentages of whole brain and tissue-specific volume change
were measured from baseline (0 months) to 3 months, from 3 to 6 months, and from 
baseline to 6 months using SIENAX Multi Time Point (SX-MTP) algorithms.
Immunological status of patients was also determined and correlations between
subsets of T cells and changes in brain volume were assessed.
RESULTS: Interferon β-1a 44 μg SC tiw in 23 patients with RRMS resulted in
significant reductions in whole brain and gray matter tissue volume early in the 
treatment course (baseline to 3 months; mean change; -0.95%; P = 0.030, -1.52%; P
= 0.004, respectively), suggesting a short-term treatment-induced pseudoatrophy
effect. From baseline to 6 months, there were significant correlations observed
between decreased T- cell expression of IL-17 F and decreased whole brain and
brain tissue-specific volume.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with the interpretation of the
pseudoatrophy effect as resolution of inflammation following treatment initiation
with interferon β-1a 44 μg SC tiw, rather than disease-related tissue loss.
