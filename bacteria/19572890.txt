INTRODUCTION: The nuclear protein high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) acts as a
late mediator of inflammation when secreted in the extracellular milieu. In this 
study, we examined the effect of lipopolysaccharides from periodontal pathogens
and apoptotic and necrotic cell death on HMGB1 production in human gingival
fibroblasts (HGF).
METHODS: HGF from healthy periodontal tissue were cultured and stimulated with
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,
Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Escherichia coli. We also initiated apoptotic and
necrotic cell deaths in HGF. The HMGB1 released in the supernatants from
stimulated or dying cells was measured. Immunocytochemical staining against HMGB1
was performed in LPS-stimulated HGF.
RESULTS: A significantly higher amount of HMGB1 was detected from necrotic and
apoptotic HGF. LPS from A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and E. coli
significantly induced the production of HMGB1 in a time-dependent manner. After 6
h of LPS stimulation, HMGB1 was present in the cytoplasm of cells whereas its
location was mainly nuclear after 24 h.
CONCLUSIONS: LPS from two major periodontal pathogens, A. actinomycetemcomitans
and P. gingivalis, induced HMGB1 secretion from HGF. Apoptotic and necrotic cell 
deaths resulted in the enhancement of HMGB1. Our results suggest that HGF can be 
a source of HMGB1 by both active secretion and passive release, and that HMGB1
from HGF may contribute to periodontal tissue destruction.
