The synthesis of high-affinity reversible competitive inhibitors of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis type II dehydroquinase, an essential enzyme in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis bacteria, is reported. The inhibitors reported here are mimics of
the enol intermediate and the effect of substitution on C2 was studied. The
crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis type II dehydroquinase in
complex with three of the reported inhibitors are also described. The results
show that an aromatic substituent on C2 prevents the closure of the active site
by impeding the hydrogen-bonding interaction of Arg108 with the essential Tyr24
of the flexible loop, the residue that initiates catalysis. Chemical
modifications of the reported acids were also carried out to improve
internalization into Mycobacterium tuberculosis through an ester prodrug
approach. Propyl esters proved to be the most efficient in achieving optimal in
vitro activities.
