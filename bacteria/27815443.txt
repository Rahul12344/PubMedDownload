The B-1 B cell population is an important bridge between innate and adaptive
immunity primarily because B-1 cells produce natural Ab. Murine B-1 and B-2 cells
arise from distinct progenitors; however, in humans, in part because it has been 
difficult to discriminate between them phenotypically, efforts to pinpoint the
developmental origins of human B-1 and B-2 cells have lagged. To characterize
progenitors of human B-1 and B-2 cells, we separated cord blood and bone marrow
Lin-CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells into Lin-CD34+CD38lo and Lin-CD34+CD38hi
populations. We found that transplanted Lin-CD34+CD38lo cells, but not
Lin-CD34+CD38hi cells, generated a CD19+ B cell population after transfer into
immunodeficient NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1wjl/SxJ neonates. The emergent CD19+ B
cell population was found in spleen, bone marrow, and peritoneal cavity of
humanized mice and included distinct populations displaying the B-1 or the B-2
cell phenotype. Engrafted splenic B-1 cells exhibited a mature phenotype, as
evidenced by low-to-intermediate expression levels of CD24 and CD38. The
engrafted B-1 cell population expressed a VH-DH-JH composition similar to cord
blood B-1 cells, including frequent use of VH4-34 (8 versus 10%, respectively).
Among patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation, B-1 cells were found in the circulation as early as 8 wk
posttransplantation. Altogether, our data demonstrate that human B-1 and B-2
cells develop from a Lin-CD34+CD38lo stem cell population, and engrafted B-1
cells in humanized mice exhibit an Ig-usage pattern comparable to B-1 cells in
cord blood.
