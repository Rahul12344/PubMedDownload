Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a conserved cytosolic enzyme,
which plays a key role in glycolysis. GAPDH catalyzes the oxidative
phosphorylation of D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate using NAD or NADP as a cofactor. 
In addition, GAPDH localized on the surface of some bacteria is thought to be
involved in macromolecular interactions and bacterial pathogenesis. GAPDH on the 
surface of group B streptococcus (GBS) enhances bacterial virulence and is a
potential vaccine candidate. Here, the crystal structure of GBS GAPDH from
Streptococcus agalactiae in complex with NAD is reported at 2.46 Å resolution.
Although the overall structure of GBS GAPDH is very similar to those of other
GAPDHs, the crystal structure reveals a significant difference in the area
spanning residues 294-307, which appears to be more acidic. The amino-acid
sequence of this region of GBS GAPDH is also distinct compared with other GAPDHs.
This region therefore may be of interest as an immunogen for vaccine development.
