During T cell activation, the engagement of costimulatory molecules is often
crucial to the development of an effective immune response, but the mechanism by 
which this is achieved is not known. Here, it is shown that beads attached to the
surface of a T cell translocate toward the interface shortly after the start of T
cell activation. This movement appears to depend on myosin motor proteins and
requires the engagement of the major costimulatory receptor pairs, B7-CD28 and
ICAM-1-LFA-1. This suggests that the engagement of costimulatory receptors
triggers an active accumulation of molecules at the interface of the T cell and
the antigen-presenting cell, which then increases the overall amplitude and
duration of T cell signaling.
