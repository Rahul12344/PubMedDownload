BACKGROUND: Skin burns are an acute trauma involving an extensive vascular damage
and an intense inflammatory response. Bone marrow-derived circulating endothelial
progenitor cells (EPC) are known to migrate to sites of neovascularization in
response to mediators (vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal
cell-derived factor-1) released after trauma and ischemia, to contribute to wound
healing, and to increase neovascularization of animal prefabricated flaps. Recent
data showed an increase in EPC number in burned patients and a positive
correlation between EPC number and total body surface area (TBSA) burnt, but data
were limited to the first 5 days after thermal injury.
METHODS: By using flow cytometry, we studied EPC (CD34, CD133, CD45, and KDR
cells) blood levels, apoptosis, and homing (stromal cell-derived factor-1
receptor expression and CXC chemokine receptor 4) in a 1-month follow-up postburn
in 25 patients with ≥15% TBSA burnt, at least grade II burns and escharectomy
performed at days 5 to 6, with respect to 31 controls.
RESULTS: EPC count at admission showed a positive linear correlation with TBSA
burnt. The EPC blood levels of the patients were low (50.7 cells/mL±61.8
cells/mL) immediately after thermal injury, then increased with two peaks, at day
1 (188.3 cells/mL±223.2 cells/mL) and day 12 (253.1 cells/mL±430.7 cells/mL) with
respect to controls (95.2 cells/mL±28.5 cells/mL, p<0.05), and then returned to
normal levels in 1 month. EPC apoptotic rate and inflammatory parameters
paralleled EPC blood count. No significant variations were found in CXC chemokine
receptor 4 expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Thermal injury and escharectomy seem to induce an intense response
in EPC production. In particular, escharectomy could improve physiologic wound
repair by increasing EPC levels.
