Chemerin receptor (CMKLR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) implicated in
macrophage-mediated inflammation and in several forms of human arthritis.
Analogous to other GPCR, CMKLR1 is likely regulated by G protein-coupled receptor
kinase (GRK) phosphorylation of intracellular domains in an activation-dependent 
manner, which leads to recruitment and termination of intracellular signaling via
desensitization and internalization of the receptor. The ubiquitously expressed
GRK family members include GRK2, GRK3, GRK5, and GRK6, but it is unknown which
GRK regulates CMKLR1 cellular and signaling functions. Our data show that
activation of CMKLR1 by chemerin in primary macrophages leads to signaling and
functional outcomes that are regulated by GRK6 and β-arrestin 2. We show that
arrestin recruitment to CMKLR1 following chemerin stimulation is enhanced with
co-expression of GRK6. Further, internalization of endogenous CMKLR1, following
the addition of chemerin, is decreased in inflammatory macrophages from GRK6- and
β-arrestin 2-deficient mice. These GRK6- and β-arrestin 2-deficient macrophages
display increased migration toward chemerin and altered AKT and
Extracellular-signal Related Kinase (ERK) signaling. Our findings show that
chemerin-activated CMKLR1 regulation in inflammatory macrophages is largely GRK6 
and β-arrestin mediated, which may impact innate immunity and have therapeutic
implications in rheumatic disease.
