PROBLEM: Angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in secretory endometrium represent 
one of the crucial steps in pregnancy establishment, for which uterine NK (uNK)
cells have an important role. Impairment of these steps may proceed to
implantation and instigate initial pathology of recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL).
In this study, we aim to investigate vascular development and density of uNK
cells in secretory endometrium of women with RPL.
METHODS OF STUDY: Mid-secretory phase endometrial tissues from women with RPL
(n = 15) and fertile controls (n = 7) were investigated. CD56+ and CD16+ uNK
cells, CD31+ vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle myosin (SMM)+ .
Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) expressing SMM were investigated using
immunohistochemistry and western blot. High-throughput quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used as well.
RESULTS: CD56+ uNK number was significantly higher in women with RPL compared to 
controls (P < 0.0001). uNK cell density by immunohistochemistry was positively
correlated with CD56 mRNA expression by qRT-PCR (r2  = 0.43, P = 0.0137). The
number of blood vessels represented by the expression of either CD31 or SMM was
higher in women with RPL as compared to controls (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001,
respectively), and correlated with the number of uNK cell (r2  = 0.18, P < 0.04, 
and r2  = 0.65, P < 0.0001, respectively). The wall thickness of spiral arteries 
was significantly higher in women with RPL as compared with that of controls
(P = 0.0027).
CONCLUSION: Increased uNK cells in mid-secretory endometrium are associated with 
increased vascularization and defective vascular transformation of spiral
arteries in women with RPL.
