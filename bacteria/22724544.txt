BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates (PCs) still
represents an ongoing risk. As a result of septic complications, particularly
observed with older PCs, the shelf life of PCs has been reduced in Germany to 4
days. In this study, bacterial screening of PCs by BactiFlow (BF) flow cytometry 
was introduced in three German blood services to evaluate the robustness and
applicability of the assay. Results were used to discuss the potential for the
extension of PC shelf life to 5 days.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 1956 PCs were tested on days 4 or 5+ after
PC production using the BF, whereas the BacT/Alert culture system served as
reference method.
RESULTS: Two PCs were confirmed positive by culture only and were identified as
Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus species. Two PCs were confirmed
positive for Streptococcus mitis by BF and culture. Additionally, two PCs were
culture-positive only in one culture bottle (aerobic: S. mitis and anaerobic: S. 
hominis). Retrospective analysis of bacterial growth kinetics provide the
indication that corresponding bacterial titres were most likely below the BF
analytical detection limit (<150 CFU mL(-1) ) and had probably no transfusion
relevance. All remaining specimens were tested negative.
CONCLUSIONS: Testing of PCs by BF was successfully implemented. The BF proved
sufficient as a rapid screening method to improve PC safety. This study further
provides data supporting the extension of PC shelf life to 5 days after negative 
BF testing on day 4.
