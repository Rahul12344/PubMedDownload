BACKGROUND: Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) leads to the
initiation of innate immune responses with increased antimicrobial peptide (AMP) 
expression in the gastric epithelium. This study aimed to determine the
expression of the novel peptides beta-defensin 4 (hBD-4) and RNase 7 in
infectious and non-infectious gastritis. Furthermore, pattern recognition
receptors and mechanisms of regulation were characterized.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of AMPs was quantified by real-time PCR in
biopsies obtained from healthy individuals and patients with infectious and
non-infectious gastritis as well as in AGS gastric epithelial cells infected with
H. pylori. Distribution of hBD-4 in the gastric mucosa was characterized by
in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry. The role of Toll-like receptors
(TLRs) 2 and 4 and associated signalling pathways was addressed.
RESULTS: hBD-4 was expressed at low levels in gastric epithelial cells and was
significantly upregulated in infectious and non-infectious gastritis. Standard
eradication but not acid suppression therapy significantly decreased hBD-4
expression. Cytotoxin associated gene (cag)A positive H. pylori significantly
increased the expression of hBD-4 whereas cagA negative organisms, non-viable
bacteria or culture supernatants had no significant effect. Overexpression and
downregulation of TLRs was not associated with an altered hBD-4 expression.
However, blocking experiments revealed an essential role for the p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase. RNase7 was inconsistently expressed in biopsies
and not significantly upregulated by H. pylori.
CONCLUSIONS: hBD-4 may play a significant role in H. pylori associated gastritis.
Inconsistent expression of RNase 7 does not support a pivotal role for this
peptide in response to infection with H. pylori.
