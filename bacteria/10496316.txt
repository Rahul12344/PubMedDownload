Chemokines induce chemotaxis of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), and
suppress their proliferation. In this study we report that SLC/
Exodus2/6Ckine/TCA4 (hereafter termed SLC) is a chemoattractant for human CD34+
HPC. SLC mainly induces preferential chemotaxis of macrophage progenitors. We
examined the chemotactic activity of CXCR3 ligands on CD34+ HPC because it has
been reported that SLC is a potential ligand of CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR3, in
addition to a CC chemokine receptor, CCR7. It was found that the CXCR3 ligands,
MIG and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 (IP-10), unlike SLC, did not induce
chemotaxis of CD34+ HPC. In this regard, CCR7 ligands (SLC and CKbeta-11), but
not IP-10 and MIG, induce actin polymerization in CD34+ cells. On the other hand,
CCR7 ligands and CXCR3 ligands, but not the CXCR4 ligand SDF-1, showed inhibitory
activity for proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. Our results suggest that 
SLC is a potential trafficking factor for HPC, and that chemokines that bind
CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR3 have differential biological activities on HPC in terms of
suppression and chemotaxis.
