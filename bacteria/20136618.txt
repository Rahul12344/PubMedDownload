Tuberculosis is caused by an intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) and poses a persistent threat to global health. MHC class I-restricted CD8 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are essential for protective immunity to
Tuberculosis. Information for CTL epitopes derived from Mtb is desirable for
vaccine design and assessment of T cell responses. However, the knowledge about
CTL epitopes of Mtb, particularly those non-A2 HLA alleles restricted is rare. In
this study, beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2m, beta(2)m) linked HLA-A24 single chain 
was expressed on RMA-S cell line defective in the endogenous antigen processing
and applied for screening of peptides which could stabilize the HLA-A24 complex
on the cell surface. From a group of peptides predicted as binders by a computer 
algorithm, five peptides were shown to bind to HLA-A24 protein on the cell
surface. As comparison we have also identified a dozen Mtb proteins derived
peptides that bind to HLA-A2 specifically. The cell line and HLA binders present 
here would be useful for further identification of CD8 restricted Mtb epitopes.
