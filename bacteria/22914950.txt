The clinical potential of therapeutic quantities of primary hematopoietic cells, 
either unmodified or altered via genetic modification, has stimulated the search 
for techniques that allow the production of large numbers of hematopoietic
precursors, more primitive progenitors, and perhaps hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC) themselves. Modifications of in vitro culture conditions to promote
progenitor cell expansion have included combinations of polypeptide cytokines,
small molecules, and transcription factors. Here we describe the methods for use 
of the transcription factor linked to a TAT-based protein transcription domain,
in combination with cytokines and serum-free culture condition to stimulate the
proliferation of primary cells. Human peripheral blood (PB) CD34(+) cells treated
with TAT-NF-Ya fusion protein and grown in vitro for 1 month proliferate four
times more than did cells in cultures that contained only cytokines, including
increased production of hematopoietic cells of all maturities. These results and 
techniques should be suitable for multiple applications of ex vivo generation of 
hematopoietic cells using protein transduction.
