The nature of the initially excited state of the primary electron donor or
special pair has been investigated by Stark effect spectroscopy for reaction
centers from the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodopseudomonas viridis and Rhodobacter
sphaeroides at 77 K. The data provide values for the magnitude of the difference 
in permanent dipole moment between the ground and excited state,
[unk]Deltamu[unk], and the angle [unk] between Deltamu and the transition dipole 
moment for the electronic transition. [unk]Deltamu[unk] and [unk] for the
lowest-energy singlet electronic transition associated with the special pair
primary electron donor were found to be very similar for the two species.
[unk]Deltamu[unk] for this transition is substantially larger than for the Q(y)
transitions of the monomeric pigments in the reaction center or for pure
monomeric bacteriochlorophylls, for which Stark data are also reported. We
conclude that the excited state of the special pair has substantial
charge-transfer character, and we suggest that charge separation in bacterial
photosynthesis is initiated immediately upon photoexcitation of the special pair.
Data for Rhodobacter sphaeroides between 340 and 1340 nm are presented and
discussed in the context of the detection of charge-transfer states by Stark
effect spectroscopy.
