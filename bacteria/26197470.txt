Inflammation is an important feature of carcinogenesis. Tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) can be associated with either poor or improved prognosis,
depending on their properties and polarization. Current knowledge of the
prognostic significance of TAMs in bladder cancer is limited and was investigated
in this study. We analyzed 184 urothelial bladder cancer patients undergoing
transurethral resection of a bladder tumor or radical cystectomy. CD68
(pan-macrophage marker), MAC387 (polarized towards type 1 macrophages), and
CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1 (type 2 macrophages and lymphatic/blood vessels) were
detected immunohistochemically. The median follow-up time was 6.0 years. High
macrophage counts associated with a higher pT category and grade. Among patients 
undergoing transurethral resection, all studied markers apart from
CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1 were associated with increased risk of progression and poorer
disease-specific and overall survival in univariate analyses. High levels of two 
macrophage markers (CD68/MAC387+/+ or CD68/CLEVER-1+/+ groups) had an independent
prognostic role after transurethral resection in multivariate analyses. In the
cystectomy cohort, MAC387, alone and in combination with CD68, was associated
with poorer survival in univariate analyses, but none of the markers were
independent predictors of outcome in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, this
study demonstrates that macrophage phenotypes provide significant independent
prognostic information, particularly in bladder cancers undergoing transurethral 
resection.
