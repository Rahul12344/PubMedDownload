To assess removal efficiency of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the wastewater 
treatment plant (WWTP), fluorescence excitation emission matrices (EEM) with
parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) and second derivative synchronous fluorescence
(SDSF) were used for the characterization of DOM in wastewater. In A(2)/O
process, tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like materials were removed to the much
greater extent than that of fulvic-like. The protein-like material might be
mostly decomposed by anaerobic and aerobic bacteria in anaerobic/anoxic and oxic 
zones. C1, C2, I276, I286, AP1 and AP2 were much better in tracing variations of 
tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like materials than C3, I329 and AF1 in tracing
fulvic-like. The number of sampling sites should be reduced, as concentration
variations of DOM components were subtle among sampling sites in the oxic zone
and secondary sedimentation tank. SDSF may be a useful tool as PARAFAC to monitor
removal efficiency of DOM fractions from wastewater in the WWTP.
