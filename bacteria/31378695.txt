BACKGROUND: Antibody-mediated rejection, a leading cause of renal allograft graft
failure, is diagnosed by histological assessment of invasive allograft biopsies. 
Accurate non-invasive biomarkers are not available.
METHODS: In the multicentre, prospective BIOMARGIN study, blood samples were
prospectively collected at time of renal allograft biopsies between June 2011 and
August 2016 and analyzed in three phases. The discovery and derivation phases of 
the study (N = 117 and N = 183 respectively) followed a case-control design and
included whole genome transcriptomics and targeted mRNA expression analysis to
construct and lock a multigene model. The primary end point was the diagnostic
accuracy of the locked multigene assay for antibody-mediated rejection in a third
validation cohort of serially collected blood samples (N = 387). This trial is
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02832661.
FINDINGS: We identified and locked an 8-gene assay (CXCL10, FCGR1A, FCGR1B, GBP1,
GBP4, IL15, KLRC1, TIMP1) in blood samples from the discovery and derivation
phases for discrimination between cases with (N = 49) and without (N = 134)
antibody-mediated rejection. In the validation cohort, this 8-gene assay
discriminated between cases with (N = 41) and without antibody-mediated rejection
(N = 346) with good diagnostic accuracy (ROC AUC 79·9%; 95% CI 72·6 to 87·2,
p < 0·0001). The diagnostic accuracy of the 8-gene assay was retained both at
time of stable graft function and of graft dysfunction, within the first year and
also later after transplantation. The 8-gene assay is correlated with
microvascular inflammation and transplant glomerulopathy, but not with the
histological lesions of T-cell mediated rejection.
INTERPRETATION: We identified and validated a novel 8-gene expression assay that 
can be used for non-invasive diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection.
