The study of human macrophages and their ontogeny is an important unresolved
issue. Here, we use a humanized mouse model expressing human cytokines to dissect
the development of lung macrophages from human hematopoiesis in vivo. Human CD34+
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) generated three macrophage
populations, occupying separate anatomical niches in the lung. Intravascular cell
labeling, cell transplantation, and fate-mapping studies established that
classical CD14+ blood monocytes derived from HSPCs migrated into lung tissue and 
gave rise to human interstitial and alveolar macrophages. In contrast,
non-classical CD16+ blood monocytes preferentially generated macrophages resident
in the lung vasculature (pulmonary intravascular macrophages). Finally,
single-cell RNA sequencing defined intermediate differentiation stages in human
lung macrophage development from blood monocytes. This study identifies distinct 
developmental pathways from circulating monocytes to lung macrophages and reveals
how cellular origin contributes to human macrophage identity, diversity, and
localization in vivo.
