Glioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor with dismal prognosis. Current
therapeutic options, consisting of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, have only
served to marginally increase patient survival. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) 
are dysregulated in approximately 90% of GBM; attributed to this, research has
focused on inhibiting RTKs as a novel and effective therapy for GBM.
Overexpression of RTK mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET), and its ligand,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), in GBM highlights a promising new therapeutic
target. This review will discuss the role of MET in cell cycle regulation, cell
proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, cell migration and invasion, angiogenesis
and therapeutic resistance in GBM. It will also discuss the modes of deregulation
of HGF/MET and their regulation by microRNAs. As the HGF/MET pathway is a vital
regulator of multiple pro-survival pathways, efforts and strategies for its
exploitation for GBM therapy are also described.
