BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To prevent bacterial adherence and translocation, the
colonic mucosa is covered by a protecting mucus layer and the epithelium
synthesizes antimicrobial peptides. The present qualitative study investigated
the contents and interaction of these peptides in and with rectal mucus.
METHODS: Rectal mucus extracts were analyzed for antimicrobial activity and
screened with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
spectrometry, Dot blot and immunohistochemistry for antimicrobial peptides. In
addition, binding of AMPs to mucins was investigated by Western blot and
enzyme-linked lectin assays.
RESULTS: In functional tests the mucus layer exhibited a strong antimicrobial
activity. We detected 11 antimicrobial peptides in mucus extracts from healthy
persons including the defensins HBD-1 and -3, the cathelicidin LL-37, ubiquitin, 
lysozyme, histones, high mobility group nucleosome-binding domain-containing
protein 2, ubiquicidin and other ribosomal proteins. AMPs were bound by mucins
but this was demonstrated to be reversible and inhibition of antibacterial
activity was limited.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that epithelial antimicrobial peptides are
retained in the intestinal mucus layer without losing their efficacy. Thus, the
mucus layer and its composition provide an attractive drug target to restore
antimicrobial barrier function in intestinal diseases.
