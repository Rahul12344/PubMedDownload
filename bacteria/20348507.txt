Intracellular protozoans of the genus Cryptosporidium are a major cause of
diarrheal illness worldwide, especially in immunocompromised individuals. CD4(+) 
T cells and interferon-gamma are key factors in the control of cryptosporidiosis 
in human and murine models. Previous studies led us to hypothesize that CD8(+) T 
cells contribute to clearance of intestinal epithelial Cryptosporidium infection 
in humans. We report here that antigen expanded sensitized CD8(+) T cells reduce 
the parasite load in infected intestinal epithelial cell cultures and lyse
infected intestinal epithelial cells. These effects are most likely mediated by
the release of cytotoxic granules. Elimination of parasites seems to require
antigen presentation through both human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and HLA-B.
These data suggest that cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells play a role in clearing
Cryptosporidium from the intestine, a previously unrecognized feature of the
human immune response against this parasite.
