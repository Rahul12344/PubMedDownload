The Met tyrosine kinase receptor is the only known receptor for hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF). Downstream Met signaling is essential for embryonic development;
however, aberrant Met signaling promotes tumor progression by facilitating cell
proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and metastasis. Tumor cell invasion
is considered an important step in distant metastatic foci formation. Several
recent reviews have focused on the pleiotropic effects of Met signaling in both
tumor cells and in the surrounding stromal cells. This review will summarize the 
currently described mechanisms driving Met induced tumor cell progression and
invasion, the role played by cells in the tumor stroma, and therapeutic
approaches to block receptor activity. In addition, this review will also
highlight two new areas of development: 1) attenuation of Met signaling via
multiple mechanisms of action targeting tumor cells and cells in the surrounding 
stroma using plant-derived polyphenols and 2) the induction by HGF of atypical
lysosome trafficking, leading to increased protease secretion and tumor cell
invasion. These new areas of research will help to uncover novel therapeutic
targets to block the HGF/Met signaling axis to slow cancer progression.
