A novel method for reconstituting sperm chromatin was used to investigate how
protamine 1 condenses DNA. Complexes formed in vitro using linearized plasmid DNA
were imaged and measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The structures formed 
were found to be highly dependent on the sample preparation method used for
reconstitution. Interstrand, side-by-side fasiculation of DNA and toroidal-like
structures only 1-2 DNA diameters thick were observed for complexes formed in
solution following direct mixing of the DNA and protamine. Large chromatin
aggregates were also observed on the mica. However, if the DNA was first allowed 
to attach to the mica prior to addition of the protamine, well-defined toroidal
complexes were formed without any observed DNA fasiculation or aggregate
formation. The diameter of the toroids measured 30.6-50.2 nm (mean 39.4 nm). The 
dimensions of these structures indicate that the condensed DNA is stacked
vertically by four to five turns, with each coil containing as little as 360-370 
bp of 'B'-form DNA. This approach for preparing and imaging DNA-protamine
complexes permits the analysis of intermediate structures 'trapped' on the mica
as partially formed toruses of nucleoprotamine.
