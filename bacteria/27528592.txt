Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate the genetic features of the
recently identified lsa(E) gene in porcine S. aureus ST9 isolates. Three
quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant isolates harboring the lsa(E) gene (two MRSA 
and one MSSA) were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of 184S. aureus genomes
showed that ST9 porcine isolates belong to a distinct sequence cluster. Further
analysis showed that all isolates were deficient in the recently described type
IV restriction-modification system and SCCmec type XII was identified in the two 
MRSA isolates, which included a rare class C2 mec gene complex. A 24kb ΨSCC
fragment was found in the MRSA and MSSA isolates sharing 99% nucleotide sequence 
homology with the ΨSCCJCSC6690 (O-2) element of a ST9 MRSA isolate from Thailand 
(accession number AB705453). Comparison of these ST9 isolates with 181 publically
available S. aureus genomes identified 24 genes present in all (100%) ST9
isolates, that were absent from the most closely related human isolate. Our
analysis suggests that the sequenced quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant ST9
lineage represent a reservoir of mobile genetic elements associated with
resistance and virulence features.
