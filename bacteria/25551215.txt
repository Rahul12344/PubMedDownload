Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight disease, has been
reported in North America since the mid-nineteenth century. In the United States 
the lack of or very limited sexual reproduction has resulted in largely clonal
populations of P. infestans. In 2010 and 2011, but not in 2012 or 2013, 20 rare
and diverse genotypes of P. infestans were detected in a region that centered
around central New York State. The ratio of A1 to A2 mating types among these
genotypes was close to the 50∶50 ratio expected for sexual recombination. These
genotypes were diverse at the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase locus, differed in
their microsatellite profiles, showed different banding patterns in a restriction
fragment length polymorphism assay using a moderately repetitive and highly
polymorphic probe (RG57), were polymorphic for four different nuclear genes and
differed in their sensitivity to the systemic fungicide mefenoxam. The null
hypothesis of linkage equilibrium was not rejected, which suggests the population
could be sexual. These new genotypes were monomorphic in their mitochondrial
haplotype that was the same as US-22. Through parentage exclusion testing using
microsatellite data and sequences of four nuclear genes, recent dominant lineages
US-8, US-11, US-23, and US-24 were excluded as possible parents for these
genotypes. Further analyses indicated that US-22 could not be eliminated as a
possible parent for 14 of the 20 genotypes. We conclude that US-22 could be a
parent of some, but not all, of the new genotypes found in 2010 and 2011. There
were at least two other parents for this population and the genotypic
characteristics of the other parents were identified.
