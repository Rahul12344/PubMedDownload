OBJECTIVES: This study describes early childhood caries prevalence and caries
risk in a group of Lebanese preschoolers.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: 99 healthy children, aged four years or less, were
recruited at the Dental medicine faculty, Saint-Joseph university, Beirut,
Lebanon. After parental consent, questionnaires investigated children's dietary
and oral hygiene habits and parents' education and health behaviors. Oral
examinations, with bite-wing radiographs when necessary, determined
decayed-filled surfaces and plaque scores. Salivary testing assessed buffer
capacity and streptococcus mutans (Sm) and lactobacillus (Lb) presence. The three
tests (questionnaire, oral examination, salivary testing) established a caries
risk assessment tool, determining subjects' caries risk scores, classified as low
(C0), moderate (C1), high (C2) or very high (C3).
RESULTS: 25.3% of subjects were caries-free, 24.2% had 4 carious lesions or less,
28.3%, 5 to 9 lesions and 22.2% over 10 lesions. 11.1% of plaque scores were low 
to mild, 18.2% moderate, 46.4% high, and 24.3% very high. Salivary buffer
capacity was: 29.3% high, 57.6% medium and 13.1% low. High levels of Sm, (66.7%) 
correlated with plaque presence and proximal caries. High levels of Lb (52.5%)
correlated with plaque presence and smooth-surface caries, and correlated
significantly with occlusal caries. Regular tooth brushing yielded lower plaque, 
but not significantly lower caries levels. Systemic fluorides were associated
with lower plaque and caries scores. Children of educated parents with regular
dental visits and oral hygiene had lower plaque and caries scores. Caries risk
distribution was: CO: 16.2%, C1: 29.3%, C2: 15.1% and C3: 39.4%.
CONCLUSION: Most subjects had at least one carious lesion (74.7%), and 70.7%
showed high to very high plaque scores. Over half the sample presented high or
very high caries risk. These findings deserve further investigation of the
Lebanese preschoolers' population.
