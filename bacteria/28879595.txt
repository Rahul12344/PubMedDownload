Filgrastim is usually combined with chemotherapy to mobilize hematopoietic
progenitor cells in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. Limited information is
available on the efficacy of a preemptive plerixafor (PLER) injection in poor
mobilizers after chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim. In this prospective study, 72
patients with NHL received chemotherapy plus pegfilgrastim, and 25
hard-to-mobilize patients received also PLER. The usefulness and efficacy of our 
previously developed algorithm for PLER use in pegfilgrastim-containing
mobilization regimen were evaluated as well as the graft cellular composition,
hematological recovery, and outcome after autologous stem cell transplantation
(auto-SCT) according to the PLER use. A median 3.4-fold increase in blood CD34+
cell counts was achieved after the first PLER dose. The minimum collection target
was achieved in the first mobilization attempt in 66/72 patients (92%) and 68
patients (94%) proceeded to auto-SCT. An algorithm for PLER use was fulfilled in 
76% of the poor mobilizers. Absolute numbers of T-lymphocytes and NK cells were
significantly higher in the PLER group, whereas the number of CD34+ cells
collected was significantly lower. Early neutrophil engraftment was slower in the
PLER group, otherwise hematological recovery was comparable within 12 months from
auto-SCT. No difference was observed in survival according to the PLER use.
Chemotherapy plus pegfilgrastim combined with preemptive PLER injection is an
effective and convenient approach to minimize collection failures in NHL patients
intended for auto-SCT. A significant effect of PLER on the graft cellular
composition was observed, but no difference in outcome after auto-SCT was
detected.
