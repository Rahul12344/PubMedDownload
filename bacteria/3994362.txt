Bacterial and fungal cometabolism of
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its breakdown products.

Subba-Rao RV, Alexander M.

Resting cells of bacteria grown in the presence of diphenylmethane oxidized
substituted analogs such as 4-hydroxydiphenylmethane,
bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane, bis(4-chlorophenyl)methane (DDM), benzhydrol, and
4,4'-dichlorobenzhydrol. Resting cells of bacteria grown with benzhydrol as the
sole carbon source oxidized substituted benzhydrols such as 4-chlorobenzhydrol,
4,4'-dichlorobenzhydrol, and other metabolites of
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), such as DDM and
bis(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid. Bacteria and fungi converted
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane to
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene,
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane, DDM, 4,4'-dichlorobenzhydrol, and
4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone. Aspergillus conicus converted 55% of
bis(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid to unidentified or unextractable water-soluble
products. Aspergillus niger and Penicillium brefeldianum converted 12.4 and
24.6%, respectively, of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane to
water-soluble and unidentified products. 4-Chlorophenylacetic acid, a product of 
ring cleavage, was formed from DDM by a false smut fungus of rice. A. niger
converted 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone to 4-chlorobenzophenone and a methylated
4-chlorobenzophenone.
