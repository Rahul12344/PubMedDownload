The current study proposed that previously characterized individual antigenic
proteins could represent potential replacement for conventional purified protein 
derivative (PPD) in tuberculosis skin testing when used in cocktails triggered by
suitable TLR-stimulants that would provide the missing pro-inflammatory stimulus.
Three different cocktails of previously selected antigens, including C1
(ESAT-6/CPF-10/MPB-83); C2 (ESAT-6/MPB-64/MPB-83); and C3 (CPF-10/MPB-64/MPB-83),
were evaluated in vitro using lymphocytic proliferation and IFN-γ production
assays, as well as mRNA and protein expression levels of TNF-α, IL-12p40, and
IL-2 as pro-inflammatory molecules. C1 showed the highest significant induction
of pro-inflammatory molecules as compared to other cocktails, yet still
significantly lower than that induced by conventional PPD. Interestingly,
inclusion of the synthetic Mycobacterium tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein
(Pam3Cys-SSNKSTTGSGETTTA) as a TLR-stimulant resulted in obvious augmentation of 
C1-induced pro-inflammatory molecules to levels comparable to that of PPD. In
addition, skin testing using sensitized guinea pig model revealed comparable
significant reaction to that of conventional PPD. ESAT-6/CPF-10/MPB-83 cocktail
is suggested as a potential alternative skin-testing reagent when used in
combination with the M. tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein as a TLR-stimulant.
