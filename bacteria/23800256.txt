BACKGROUND: Ambulatory consolidation chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) is frequently associated with bloodstream infections but the spectrum of
bacterial pathogens in this setting has not been well-described.
METHODS: We evaluated the emergence of bacteremias and their respective
antibiotic susceptibility patterns in AML patients receiving ambulatory-based
consolidation therapy. Following achievement of complete remission, 207 patients 
received the first cycle (C1), and 195 the second cycle (C2), of consolidation on
an ambulatory basis. Antimicrobial prophylaxis consisted of ciprofloxacin,
amoxicillin and fluconazole.
RESULTS: There were significantly more positive blood cultures for E. coli in C2 
as compared to C1 (10 vs. 1, p=0.0045); all E. coli strains for which
susceptibility testing was performed demonstrated resistance to ciprofloxacin. In
patients under age 60 there was a significantly higher rate of Streptococccus
spp. bacteremia in C2 vs. C1; despite amoxicillin prophylaxis all Streptococcus
isolates in C2 were sensitive to penicillin. Patients with Staphylococcus
bacteremia in C1 had significantly higher rates of Staphylococcus bacteremia in
C2 (p=0.009, OR=8.6).
CONCLUSIONS: For AML patients undergoing outpatient-based intensive consolidation
chemotherapy with antibiotic prophylaxis, the second cycle is associated with
higher rates of ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli, penicillin-sensitive
Streptococcus bacteremias and recurrent Staphylococcus infections.
