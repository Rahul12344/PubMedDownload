IL-4 acts as a potent stimulator of IFN-γ expression in CD8+ T cells through
STAT6-dependent and independent induction of Eomesodermin and T-bet.

CD8+ T cell synthesis of IFN-γ is an important component of the CD8+ T cell
immune response. In short-term cultures of murine pan-T cells, we found that IL-4
was the principal cytokine responsible for driving IFN-γ synthesis by
CD3/CD28-activated CD8+ T cells. IL-4 was able to induce low levels of IFN-γ mRNA
in CD8+ T cells even in the absence of CD3/CD28 engagement, although concomitant 
CD3/CD28 stimulation was necessary for IFN-γ secretion. IL-4 induction of IFN-γ
was explained by its ability to induce Eomesodermin and T-bet transcription
factors whose expression was further increased by CD3/CD28. Expression of
Eomesodermin, T-bet and IFN-γ induced by IL-4 was partially dependent upon
activation of MAPK and PI3K but independent of the canonical IL-4-activated
transcription factor, STAT6. In contrast, expression of IFN-γ induced by
IL-4/CD3/CD28 stimulation showed additional dependency upon STAT6 which functions
to increase expression of Eomesodermin specifically. These novel findings point
to a function for IL-4 as a direct regulator of IFN-γ expression in CD8+ T cells 
and reveal the molecular mechanisms involved.
