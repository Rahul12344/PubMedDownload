Umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived primitive hematopoietic stem progenitor cells
(HSPC) are a promising source for stem cell-based gene therapy due to the reduced
incidence and severity of graftversus- host disease (GVHD) after human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA)-disparate CB transplantation. Cell-surface markers such as CD34 and
CD133 have been used in combination to enrich primitive HSPC for research and
clinical applications. To understand the molecular characteristics of the CB
HSPC, we compared the global gene expression of freshly isolated CB CD34+ CD133+ 
cells with their progenies using a cDNA microarray containing 22,000 human cDNA
clones printed on a single chip. A total of 139 genes were differentially
expressed between CB HSPC and their progenies. These transcripts included a
number of known genes that might play roles in key functions of CB HSPC as well
as many genes of unknown function. Among the genes showing the greatest
differential expression levels in HSPC were: psoriasin 1, CRHBP, HDAC3, MLLT3,
HBEX2, SPINK2, c-kit, H2BFQ, CD133, HHEX, TCF4, ALDH1A1, and FHL1. These data
provide more information on the molecular phenotype of CB HSPC and may lead to
the identification of new genes critical to stem cell function.
