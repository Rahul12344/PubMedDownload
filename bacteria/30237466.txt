Peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD) is a virulence factor unique to pathogenic
Porphyromonas species, especially P. gingivalis. Mechanistically, PPAD activity, 
in conjunction with Arg-specific gingipains, generates protein fragments with
citrullinated C-termini. Such polypeptides are potential de novo epitopes that
are key drivers of rheumatoid arthritis. This process could underlie the observed
clinical association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. However, the
role of PPAD in host colonization by P. gingivalis and, subsequently, in
triggering periodontitis is not known. Therefore, the aim of the current study
was to delineate the role of PPAD in bacterial biofilm formation, and to define
whether adherence to, invasion of, and host responses to bacteria of gingival
keratinocytes depend on PPAD activity. We studied these aspects using
PPAD-competent and PPAD-incompetent strains of P. gingivalis, and demonstrated
that neither biofilm formation nor its composition was affected by PPAD activity.
Similarly, flow cytometry revealed that PPAD did not impact the ability of P.
gingivalis to adhere to and, subsequently, invade keratinocytes. Network analyses
of gene expression patterns, however, revealed a group of host genes that were
sensitive to PPAD activity (CXCL8, IL36G, CCL20, and IL1B). These genes can be
categorized as potent immune modulators belonging to the interleukin 1 system, or
chemoattractants of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Thus, we conclude that PPAD,
although it is a potent modulator of the immune response, does not affect
bacterial biofilm formation or the ability of P. gingivalis to adhere to and
invade gingival epithelial cells.
