OBJECTIVE: Knowledge on characteristics and outcome of ICU patients with AIDS is 
highly limited. We aimed to determine the main reasons for admission and outcome 
in ICU patients with AIDS and trends over time therein.
DESIGN: A retrospective study within the Dutch National Intensive Care Evaluation
registry.
SETTING: Dutch ICUs.
PATIENTS: We used data collected between 1997 and 2014. Characteristics of
patients with AIDS were compared with ICU patients without AIDS, matched for age,
sex, admission type, and admission year. Joinpoint regression analysis was
applied to study trends over time.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 1,127 patients with AIDS and 4,479
matched controls. The main admission diagnoses of patients with AIDS were
respiratory infection (28.6%) and sepsis (16.9%), which were less common in
controls (7.7% and 7.5%, respectively; both p < 0.0001). Patients with AIDS had
increased severity of illness and in-hospital mortality (28.2% vs 17.8%; p <
0.0001) compared with controls, which was associated with a higher rate of
infections at admission in patients with AIDS (58.4% vs 25.5%). Over time, the
proportion of patients with AIDS admitted with an infection decreased (75% in
1999 to 56% in 2013). Mortality declined in patients with AIDS (39% in 1999 to
16% in 2013), both in patients with or without an infection. Mortality also
declined in matched controls without AIDS, but to a lesser extent.
CONCLUSION: Infections are still the main reason for ICU admission in patients
with AIDS, but their prevalence is declining. Outcome of patients with AIDS
continued to improve during a time of widespread availability of combination
antiretroviral therapy, and mortality is reaching levels similar to ICU patients 
without AIDS.
