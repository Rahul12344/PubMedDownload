Alterations of oxygen metabolism in experimental bacteremia.

Fry DE, Kaelin CR, Giammara BL, Rink RD.

To examine the mechanisms underlying organ failure and disordered cellular
metabolism in sepsis, systemic oxygenation, hepatic tissue oxygenation, and
hepatic mitochondrial metabolism were studied in rats subjected to an LD100 dose 
of E. coli bacteria administered intravascularly. The animals maintained normal
systemic oxygenation and remained normotensive during the six-hour study period. 
Hepatic tissue pO2 declined nearly 90% in comparison to controls. Isolated
hepatic mitochondria demonstrated statistically increased respiratory control
indices that are characteristic of cellular hypoxia. Histologic examination of
liver tissue showed obliteration of the sinusoids with debris and cellular
aggregates. The data suggest that altered cellular oxygen delivery secondary to
sinusoidal obliteration may have significance in hepatic failure and subsequent
death in septic patients.
