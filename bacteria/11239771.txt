The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes invades a variety of cells in vitro and in
vivo. Two proteins are crucial in this process: internalin, which interacts with 
E-cadherin, and InlB. The first identified ligand for InlB was gC1qR, which has
no cytoplasmic domain. The newly discovered InlB receptor, Met, fits with the
known InlB-induced signals.
