This study was conducted to compare the effects of commercially available (C) and
green synthesized (GS) Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) on immunological
responses of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) skin mucus. GS ZnO-NPs were generated 
using Thymus pubescent and characterized by UV-vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Fish (n = 150) were randomly allocated into five groups
in triplicate and received a waterborne concentration of 0% (control), 25%, and
50% of LC50 96 h of commercially available (C1 and C2) and green synthesized
ZnO-NPs (GS1 and GS2) for 21 days. Results from XRD displayed ZnO-NPs with 58 nm 
in size and UV-vis DRS, EDX, and FT-IR analysis showed that some functional
groups from plant extract bonded to the surface of NPs. The SEM images showed
that ZnO-NPs have conical morphology. Acute toxicity study showed a higher dose
of LC5096h for green synthesized ZnO-NPs (78.9 mg.L-1) compared to the commercial
source (59.95 mg.L-1). The highest activity of lysozyme and alternative
complement activity (ACH50) were found in control and GS1 groups. A significant
decrease in alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) was found in C1 and C2 groups
compared to other treatments. Protease activity (P) was significantly decreased
in the C2 group compared to the control and GS groups. Total immunoglobulin
(total Ig) content was the highest in the control. In addition, total Ig in the
GS1 group was higher than GS2. The exposure to ZnO-NPs lowered total protein
content in all experimental groups when compared to control. Present findings
revealed lower induced immunosuppressive effects by green synthesized ZnO-NPs on 
key parameters of fish skin mucus.
