Professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are potent generators of tumor
antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for adoptive immunotherapy;
however, generation of APCs is cumbersome, expensive, and subject to the tumor
microenvironment. Artificial APCs (aAPCs) have been developed as a cost-effective
alternative to APCs. We developed a cellular aAPC that efficiently generated
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)-specific CTLs. We genetically modified the human B cell
lymphoma cell line BJAB with a lentiviral vector to establish an aAPC called
BA15. The expression of AFP(158-166)-HLA-A*02:01 complex, CD80, CD86, and
interleukin (IL)-15 in BA15 cells was assessed. The efficiency of BA15 at
generating AFP-specific CTLs and the specific cytotoxicity of CTLs against AFP+
cells were also determined. BA15 cells expressed high levels of AFP(158-166)
peptide, HLA-A2, CD80, CD86, and IL-15. BA15 cells also exhibited higher
efficiency in generating AFP-specific CTLs than did dendritic cells. These CTLs
had greater cytotoxicity against AFP+ hepatocellular carcinoma cells than did
CTLs obtained from dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo. Our novel aAPC system
could provide a robust platform for the generation of functional AFP-specific
CTLs for adoptive immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.
