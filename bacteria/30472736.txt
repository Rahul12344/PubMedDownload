Recent studies have suggested that neutrophils can exert anti-inflammatory
effects. To determine the role of neutrophils in the acute response to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall,
we challenged neutrophil-depleted and control mice with LPS and analyzed the
plasma concentrations of biomarkers indicative of the cytokine and chemokine
network, activation of coagulation and the vascular endothelium, and cellular
injury. We here show that neutrophils serve an anti-inflammatory role upon LPS
administration, as reflected by sustained elevations of multiple cytokines and
chemokines, and enhanced release of nucleosomes in mice depleted of neutrophils, 
compared with control mice.
