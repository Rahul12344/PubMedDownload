The CD34 antigen defines a subset of hematopoietic progenitor cells with
self-renewal capacity and the ability to reconstitute hematopoiesis in irradiated
primates and marrow-ablated humans, but its function remains unknown. The c-myb
protooncogene plays a fundamental role in hematopoiesis, most likely via its
transcriptional regulator function. We report that c-myb protein transactivates
the CD34 promoter via specific interaction with multiple Myb binding sites in the
5' flanking region of the gene and induces expression of the endogenous CD34 mRNA
in rodent fibroblasts. Also, constitutive expression of c-myb in CD34-negative
human glioblastoma cells induces expression of CD34 mRNA and synthesis of the
surface membrane antigen. These data directly demonstrate that c-myb regulates
the expression of the hematopoietic stem cell antigen CD34 and raise the
possibility that c-myb regulates hematopoiesis inducing a cascade of
differentiation-related events.
