Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most refractory subtype of breast
cancer. It causes the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, which has been
largely associated with the plasticity of tumor cells and persistence of cancer
stem cells (CSCs). Conventional chemotherapeutics enrich CSCs and lead to drug
resistance and disease relapse. Development of a strategy capable of inhibiting
both bulk and CSC populations is an unmet medical need. Inhibitors against
estrogen receptor 1, HDACs, or mTOR have been studied in the treatment of TNBC;
however, the results are inconsistent. In this work, we found that patient TNBC
samples expressed high levels of mTORC1 and HDAC genes in comparison to luminal
breast cancer samples. Furthermore, co-inhibition of mTORC1 and HDAC with
rapamycin and valproic acid, but neither alone, reproducibly promoted ESR1
expression in TNBC cells. In combination with tamoxifen (inhibiting ESR1), both
S6RP phosphorylation and rapamycin-induced 4E-BP1 upregulation in TNBC bulk cells
was inhibited. We further showed that fractionated CSCs expressed higher levels
of mTORC1 and HDAC than non-CSCs. As a result, co-inhibition of mTORC1, HDAC, and
ESR1 was capable of reducing both bulk and CSC subpopulations as well as the
conversion of fractionated non-CSC to CSCs in TNBC cells. These observations were
partially recapitulated with the cultured tumor fragments from TNBC patients.
Furthermore, co-administration of rapamycin, valproic acid, and tamoxifen
retarded tumor growth and reduced CD44high/+/CD24low/- CSCs in a human TNBC
xenograft model and hampered tumorigenesis after secondary transplantation. Since
the drugs tested are commonly used in clinic, this study provides a new
therapeutic strategy and a strong rationale for clinical evaluation of these
combinations for the treatment of patients with TNBC.
