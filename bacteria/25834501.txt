OBJECTIVE: This study measured the human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) and CA125
levels in Chinese women with benign gynecological disorders.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sera were obtained from Chinese women prior to surgery for 
a pelvic mass and HE4 and CA125 levels were determined. The proportions of
patients with HE4 and CA125 levels were compared.
RESULTS: There were 68 Chinese women with benign diseases. HE4 levels were less
elevated than CA125 (1% V.S. 29%, P<0.001). The significant difference was
observed in patients with endometriosis/endometriomas in which HE4 was not
elevated patients and CA125 was elevated in 53% (P<0.001). Serum HE4 level was
not elevated in patients with cystadenoma (0% V.S. 23%, P<0.001) and in patients 
with germ cell tumors (0% V.S. 5%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: HE4 was less elevated and more suitable as a biomarker than CA125 in 
chinese women with benign disease.
