BACKGROUND: There is great interest in characterizing the proteins of the gastric
pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, especially those proteins to which humans respond 
immunologically. Such proteins have potential importance in diagnosis and vaccine
development.
METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with Western blotting
was used to separate and identify potential antigens of Helicobacter pylori
strain Z-170. Proteins found to be reactive with pooled sera from 14 infected
patients were individually digested in situ with endoproteinase Lys-C, and the
resulting fragments were analyzed by matrix assisted laser desorption
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).
RESULTS: Over 20 proteins were reactive in Western blots with pooled sera from 14
infected patients. The mass spectral data was compared with predictions from the 
H. pylori genome DNA sequence. Each of the 20 proteins was readily identified.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose that this "proteome" approach for identification of
previously unknown proteins will be useful in examining regulation of H. pylori
gene expression and protein localization in the development of improved serologic
tests to detect and monitor H. pylori infection. This approach will also be
useful for identifying potential targets for antimicrobial or vaccine development
for H. pylori and other pathogens whose genomes have been sequenced.
