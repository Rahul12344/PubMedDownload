Biomaterials can improve the safety and presentation of therapeutic agents for
effective immunotherapy, and a high level of control over surface
functionalization is essential for immune cell modulation. Here, we developed
biocompatible immune cell-engaging particles (ICEp) that use synthetic short DNA 
as scaffolds for efficient and tunable protein loading. To improve the safety of 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, micrometre-sized ICEp were
injected intratumorally to present a priming signal for systemically administered
AND-gate CAR-T cells. Locally retained ICEp presenting a high density of priming 
antigens activated CAR T cells, driving local tumour clearance while sparing
uninjected tumours in immunodeficient mice. The ratiometric control of
costimulatory ligands (anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies) and the surface
presentation of a cytokine (IL-2) on ICEp were shown to substantially impact
human primary T cell activation phenotypes. This modular and versatile
biomaterial functionalization platform can provide new opportunities for
immunotherapies.
