Phytophthora infestans has been a named pathogen for well over 150 years and yet 
it continues to "emerge", with thousands of articles published each year on it
and the late blight disease that it causes. This review explores five attributes 
of this oomycete pathogen that maintain this constant attention. First, the
historical tragedy associated with this disease (Irish potato famine) causes many
people to be fascinated with the pathogen. Current technology now enables
investigators to answer some questions of historical significance. Second, the
devastation caused by the pathogen continues to appear in surprising new
locations or with surprising new intensity. Third, populations of P. infestans
worldwide are in flux, with changes that have major implications to disease
management. Fourth, the genomics revolution has enabled investigators to make
tremendous progress in terms of understanding the molecular biology (especially
the pathogenicity) of P. infestans. Fifth, there remain many compelling
unanswered questions.
