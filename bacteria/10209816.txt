Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry and fingerlings with clinical signs of
rainbow trout fry syndrome, and rainbow trout (0.5 to 3.5 g) with experimentally 
induced infections with Flavobacterium psychrophilum, were examined
histopathologically and electron microscopically. Severe hypertrophy of the
spleen and cellular degeneration were consistently observed. Distinctive features
of the disease were the loss of definition of the splenic border and its
replacement by a loosely structured eosinophilic layer, fibrinous inflammation
and intercellular oedema within the spleen, and the presence of numerous
filamentous bacteria interspersed throughout the organ.
