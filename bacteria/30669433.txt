A variety of natural compounds have been shown to modulate T cell receptor (TCR) 
activation, including natural sesquiterpene lactones (SLs). In the present
studies, we evaluated the biological activity of 11 novel semi-synthetic SLs to
determine their ability to modulate TCR activation. Of these compounds, α
-epoxyarglabin, cytisinyl epoxyarglabin, 1 β ,10 α -epoxyargolide, and
chloroacetate grosheimin inhibited anti-CD3-induced Ca2+ mobilization and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation in Jurkat T
cells. We also found that the active SLs depleted intracellular glutathione (GSH)
in Jurkat T cells, supporting their reactivity towards thiol groups. Because the 
zeta-chain associated tyrosine kinase 70 kDa (ZAP-70) is essential for TCR
signaling and contains a tandem SH2 region that is highly enriched with multiple 
cysteines, we performed molecular docking of natural SLs and their semi-synthetic
derivatives into the ZAP-70 binding site. The docking showed that the distance
between the carbon atom of the exocyclic methylene group and the sulfur atom in
Cys39 of the ZAP-70 tandem SH2 module was 3.04⁻5.3 Å for active compounds.
Furthermore, the natural SLs and their derivatives could be differentiated by
their ability to react with the Cys39 SH-group. We suggest that natural and/or
semi-synthetic SLs with an α -methylene- γ -lactone moiety can specifically
target GSH and the kinase site of ZAP-70 and inhibit the initial phases of TCR
activation.
