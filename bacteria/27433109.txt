Objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of coated edible
films with chitosan solutions enriched with essential oil (EO) on the chemical,
microbial and sensory properties of Kashar cheese during ripening time.
Generally, no differences were found in total aerobic mesophilic bacteria,
streptococci and lactoccocci counts among cheeses but these microorganism counts 
increased during 60 and 90 d storage especially in C1 (uncoated sample) as
compared with coated samples. Antimicrobial effectiveness of the films against
moulds was measured on 30, 60, and 90 d of storage. In addition of fish EO into
chitosan edible films samples were showed to affect significantly decreased the
moulds (p<0.05) as 1.15 Log CFU/g in C4 (with fish oil (1% w/v) fortified
chitosan film) on the 90(th) d, while in C1 as 3.89 Log CFU/g on the 90(th) d of 
ripening. Compared to other cheese samples, C2 (coated with chitosan film) and C4
coated cheese samples revealed higher levels of water-soluble nitrogen and
ripening index at the end of storage. C2 coated cheese samples were preferred
more by the panellists while C4 coated cheese samples received the lowest scores.
