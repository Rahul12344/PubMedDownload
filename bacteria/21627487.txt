In the present study, we report on the reduced susceptibility to teicoplanin
among clinical isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus in a hematology ward of a 
teaching hospital. The molecular characterization of 17 S. haemolyticus strains
was performed using mec gene complex classification, pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis analysis, and minimum inhibitory concentration examination.
Pulsotype A strains carrying a class C2 mec gene complex were the most prevalent 
strains, at 64.7%. In vivo selection of stepwise increase in resistance to
vancomycin and teicoplanin was observed in three S. haemolyticus strains serially
isolated from a case patient. The results of the present study suggest the
regional spread of certain S. haemolyticus clones with diminished susceptibility 
to glycopeptides, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring of minimum
inhibitory concentration levels of vancomycin and teicoplanin in S. haemolyticus 
strains, and the importance of infection control practices to prevent its
transmission.
