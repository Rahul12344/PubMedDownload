High-level heterologous expression of human 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)
24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) in Escherichia coli was attained via a fusion construct 
by appending the mature CYP24A1 without the leader sequence to the maltose
binding protein (MBP). Facile purification was achieved efficiently through
affinity chromatography and afforded fully functional enzyme of near homogeneity,
with a k(cat) of 0.12 min(-1) and a K(M) of 0.19 μM toward 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D(3) [1,25(OH)(2)D(3)]. A convenient and reliable cell-free assay was established
and used to screen vitamin D analogues with potential inhibitory properties
toward CYP24A1. Some of the compounds exhibited potent inhibition with K(I)
values as low as 0.021 μM. Furthermore, TS17 and CPA1 exhibited superior
specificity toward CYP24A1 over 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), 
with selectivities of 39 and 80, respectively. Addition of TS17 or CPA1 to a
mouse osteoblast culture sustained the level of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in the medium.
Their activities in vitamin D receptor (VDR) binding, CYP24A1 transcription, and 
HL-60 cell differentiation were evaluated as well.
