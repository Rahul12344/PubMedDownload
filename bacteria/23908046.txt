Monalysin was recently described as a novel pore-forming toxin (PFT) secreted by 
the Drosophila pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila. Recombinant monalysin is
multimeric in solution, whereas PFTs are supposed to be monomeric until target
membrane association. Monalysin crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion method using PEG 8000 as precipitant. Preliminary X-ray
diffraction analysis revealed that monalysin crystals belonged to the monoclinic 
space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 162.4, b = 146.2, c = 144.4 Å, β = 
122.8°, and diffracted to 2.85 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation.
Patterson self-rotation analysis and Matthews coefficient calculation indicate
that the asymmetric unit contains nine copies of monalysin. Heavy-atom derivative
data were collected and a Ta6Br14 cluster derivative data set confirmed the
presence of ninefold noncrystallographic symmetry.
