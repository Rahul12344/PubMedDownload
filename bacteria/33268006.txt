Using the "chiral pool" approach, two modified total syntheses of the
biologically active δ-lactone cleistenolide (1) have been achieved starting from 
d-glucose. These approaches also enabled the preparation of novel analogues and
derivatives of natural product 1. The applied strategy for the synthesis of 1
involves: the initial degradation of the chiral precursor for a single C-atom,
C2-fragment chain extension using Z-selective Wittig reaction, and the final
δ-lactonization. All tested cleistenolide analogues displayed antimicrobial
activity against a panel of nine microbial strains, most of them superseding the 
activity of cleistenolide itself, and, in some cases, coming close in value to
the observed minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol. Increased
lipophilicity of the derivatives and the non-sterically congested conjugated
lactone moiety were a prerequisite for analogues with high inhibitory activity
against S. aureus and, in general, Gram-positive bacteria.
