Platinum-based therapy is most often used to treat advanced cases of head and
neck cancers, but only a small fraction of the patient population responds to
cisplatin, with a median survival time of less than a year. Although gene
signatures and molecular etiology of head and neck cancers have been previously
described, none of them are predictive indicators of cisplatin treatment response
in particular. Therefore, currently, there is a lack of clinically employable
predictive indicators of the disease beyond HPV status to specifically predict
patients' response to platinum-based therapy. It beckons a substantial effort to 
look for predictive indicators of cisplatin treatment response. In this regard,
CD24 expression level appears to be a significant molecular phenotype of
cisplatin-resistant residual cells in laryngeal carcinoma lines. CD24 expression 
level directly affects cisplatin sensitivity and affects the expression of
critical apoptotic, stem and drug resistance genes. A relatively small
retrospective patient tumor analysis suggests that CD24 high tumors go on to show
an unfavorable response to cisplatin treatment. Overall, based on the strength of
further analysis, CD24 presents a strong rationale to be utilized as a predictive
indicator to stratify head and neck cancer patients for platinum-based therapy.
It also provides a rationale for using CD24 as a therapeutic adjuvant target
along with standard cisplatin therapy.
