Human keratinocytes are known to kill living microbes. They express different
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2),
TLR4, the CD1d molecule and a keratinocyte mannose-binding receptor (KcMR). In
response to challenge with microbes or microbial-derived substances the
activation and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, the production of nitric oxide
(NO) and inflammatory cytokines occur in keratinocytes, in a TLR-dependent
manner. Blocking of NF-kappaB activation or NO production inhibit the Candida
albicans-killing activity of keratinocytes. This Candida killing activity could
be inhibited by blocking of KcMR. Recognition of invading pathogens in the
epidermis triggers cytokine production in keratinocytes leading to elimination of
pathogens and the activation of the adaptive immune system. These findings stress
the importance of the role of keratinocytes in innate immunity.
