contributes to efficient and prolonged fecal shedding.

Little is known about factors which enable Salmonella serotypes to circulate
within populations of livestock and domestic fowl. We have identified a DNA
region which is present in Salmonella serotypes commonly isolated from livestock 
and domestic fowl (S. enterica subspecies I) but absent from reptile-associated
Salmonella serotypes (S. bongori and S. enterica subspecies II to VII). This DNA 
region was cloned from Salmonella serotype Typhimurium and sequence analysis
revealed the presence of a 6,105-bp open reading frame, designated shdA, whose
product's deduced amino acid sequence displayed homology to that of AIDA-I from
diarrheagenic Escherichia coli, MisL of serotype Typhimurium, and IcsA of
Shigella flexneri. The shdA gene was located adjacent to xseA at 52 min, in a
30-kb DNA region which is not present in Escherichia coli K-12. A serotype
Typhimurium shdA mutant was shed with the feces in reduced numbers and for a
shorter period of time compared to its isogenic parent. A possible role for the
shdA gene during the expansion in host range of S. enterica subspecies I to
include warm-blooded vertebrates is discussed.
