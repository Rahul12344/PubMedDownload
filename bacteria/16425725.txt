This study conducted from 1999 to 2000 in the suburbs of Bobo Dioulasso a town in
the South of Burkina, aimed at investigating the susceptibility of the local
population of Culex quinquefasciatus to various insecticides and proposing
alternative strategies allowing a better management of insecticide resistance in 
the field. Eggs of C. quinquefasciatus were first collected in stagnant waste
water places. The larvae were reared to early 4rth instar and tested by larval
bioassays to determine the LC50/95 and the resistance ratios (RR50 and RR95) as
well as their confidence intervals. A susceptible reference Strain "Slab" was
used as control. Resistance was found to DDT and pyrethroids, but reduced
susceptibility was found for carbamates, organophosphorates, phenyl pyrazole and 
in a less extend to Bacillus sphaericus. Resistance to pyrethroides is quite
alarming since these insecticides are mainly used for bed net impregnation for
the Roll Back malaria programme implemented in Africa. The high levels of
insecticide resistance in C. quinquefasciatus suggest that alternative strategies
have to be implemented to minimize the pressure of selection on resistant genes. 
The use of bio-larvicides (Bacillus sphaericus) alone or in rotation with
different compounds may be a promising strategy for controlling C.
quinquefasciatus in Bobo Dioulasso.
