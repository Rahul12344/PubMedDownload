BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) -1 and TREM-2
are key regulators of the inflammatory response that are involved in the
clearance of invading pathogens. Melioidosis, caused by the "Tier 1" biothreat
agent Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a common form of community-acquired sepsis in
Southeast-Asia. TREM-1 has been suggested as a biomarker for sepsis and
melioidosis. We aimed to characterize the expression and function of TREM-1 and
TREM-2 in melioidosis.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Wild-type, TREM-1/3 (Trem-1/3-/-) and TREM-2
(Trem-2-/-) deficient mice were intranasally infected with live B. pseudomallei
and killed after 24, and/or 72 h for the harvesting of lungs, liver, spleen, and 
blood. Additionally, survival studies were performed. Cellular functions were
further analyzed by stimulation and/or infection of isolated cells. TREM-1 and
TREM-2 expression was increased both in the lung and liver of B.
pseudomallei-infected mice. Strikingly, Trem-2-/-, but not Trem-1/3-/-, mice
displayed a markedly improved host defense as reflected by a strong survival
advantage together with decreased bacterial loads, less inflammation and reduced 
organ injury. Cellular responsiveness of TREM-2, but not TREM-1, deficient blood 
and bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) was diminished upon exposure to B.
pseudomallei. Phagocytosis and intracellular killing of B. pseudomallei by BMDM
and alveolar macrophages were TREM-1 and TREM-2-independent.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We found that TREM-2, and to a lesser extent TREM-1,
plays a remarkable detrimental role in the host defense against a clinically
relevant Gram-negative pathogen in mice: TREM-2 deficiency restricts the
inflammatory response, thereby decreasing organ damage and mortality.
