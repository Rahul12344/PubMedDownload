Crystalline membranes reconstituted from Escherichia coli OmpF porin and
phospholipids were adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica and imaged in solution by the
atomic force microscope. The extracellular as well as the periplasmic side of the
porin trimers could be identified and the conditions to record topographs at 1-nm
lateral and 0.1-nm vertical resolution were established.
