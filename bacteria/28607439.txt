Lens ervoides, a wild relative of lentil is an important source of allelic
diversity for enhancing the genetic resistance of the cultivated species against 
economically important fungal diseases, such as anthracnose and Stemphylium
blight caused by Colletotrichum lentis and Stemphylium botryosum, respectively.
To unravel the genetic control underlying resistance to these fungal diseases, a 
recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (n = 94, F9) originating from a cross
between two L. ervoides accessions, L01-827A and IG 72815, was genotyped on the
Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 289.07 million 100 bp paired-end reads
were generated, giving an average 7.53-fold genomic coverage to the RILs and
identifying 2,180 high-quality SNPs that assembled in 543 unique haplotypes.
Seven linkage groups were resolved among haplotypes, equal to the haploid
chromosome number in L. ervoides. The genetic map spanned a cumulative distance
of 740.94 cM. Composite interval mapping revealed five QTLs with a significant
association with resistance to C. lentis race 0, six QTLs for C. lentis race 1
resistance, and three QTLs for S. botryosum resistance. Taken together, the data 
obtained in the study reveal that the expression of resistance to fungal diseases
in L. ervoides is a result of rearrangement of resistant alleles contributed by
both parental accessions.
