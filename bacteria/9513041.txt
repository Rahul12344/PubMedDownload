The vitamin D receptor (VDR) heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR)
and requires additional protein-protein interactions to regulate the expression
of target genes. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the previously 
described protein L7, that specifically interacted with the VDR in the presence
of vitamin D. Deletion analysis indicated, that the N-terminus of L7, which
harbours a basic region leucine zipper like domain, mediated interaction with the
VDR. Binding assays with purified GST-L7 demonstrated, that L7 specifically
pulled down the VDR, that was either expressed in yeast or endogenously contained
in the cell line U937. Interestingly, L7 inhibited ligand-dependent VDR-RXR
heterodimerization, when constitutively expressed in yeast. We also demonstrate
that L7 repressed binding of VDR-RXR heterodimers to a vitamin D response
element. Surprisingly, L7 recruited RXR to the same response element in the
presence of 9-cis retinoic acid. Ligand-dependent protein-protein interaction in 
the yeast two-hybrid system confirmed, that binding of L7 also was targeted at
the RXR. Our data suggest, that protein L7 is a coregulator of VDR-RXR mediated
transactivation of genes, that modulates transcriptional activity by interfering 
with binding of the receptors to genomic enhancer elements.
