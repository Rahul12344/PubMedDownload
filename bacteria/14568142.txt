The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and the 
glyoxylate bypass enzyme isocitrate lyase are involved in catabolism of
isocitrate and play a key role in controlling the metabolic flux between the TCA 
cycle and the glyoxylate shunt. Two IDH genes icd1 and icd2 of Ralstonia eutropha
HF39, encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2
(IDH2), were identified and characterized. Icd1 was functionally expressed in
Escherichia coli, whereas icd2 was expressed in E. coli but no activity was
obtained. Interposon-mutants of icd1 (HF39Deltaicd1) and icd2 (HF39Deltaicd2) of 
R. eutropha HF39 were constructed and their phenotypes were investigated.
HF39Deltaicd1 retained 43% of IDH activity, which was not induced by acetate, and
HF39Deltaicd2 expressed 74% of acetate-induced IDH activity. Both
HF39Deltaicd1and HF39Deltaicd2 kept the same growth rate on acetate as the
wild-type. These data suggested that IDH1 is induced by acetate. The
interposon-mutants HF39Deltaicd1 and HF39Deltaicd2 accumulated the same amount of
poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) as the wild-type.
