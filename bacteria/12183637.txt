COP9 signalosome (CSN) cleaves the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 from the Cul1
subunit of SCF ubiquitin ligases. The Jab1/MPN domain metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif 
in the Jab1/Csn5 subunit was found to underlie CSN's Nedd8 isopeptidase activity.
JAMM is found in proteins from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes, including the
Rpn11 subunit of the 26S proteasome. Metal chelators and point mutations within
JAMM abolished CSN-dependent cleavage of Nedd8 from Cul1, yet had little effect
on CSN complex assembly. Optimal SCF activity in yeast and both viability and
proper photoreceptor cell (R cell) development in Drosophila melanogaster
required an intact Csn5 JAMM domain. We propose that JAMM isopeptidases play
important roles in a variety of physiological pathways.
