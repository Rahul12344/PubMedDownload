BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to compare the diagnostic accuracy of
blood smear review criteria, by means of three different panel rules, those
proposed by: the International Consensus Group for Hematology [41-ICGH rules],
the Italian Survey [IS rules] and the Working Group on Hematology-SIBioC (WGH)
consensus rules (WGH rules).
METHODS: This study is based on 2707 peripheral blood (PB) samples referred for
routine hematological testing to the WGH-associated laboratories displaced all
over the Italian territory. The PB samples were processed on seven different
hematology analyzers (HAs): Advia 2120i, XE-2100, BC-6800, ABX Pentra, XN-1000,
Cell-DYN Sapphire, and DxH800, respectively. All the results provided by the HAs 
were analyzed through the application of three different blood smear review
criteria: that is, the 41-ICGH, IS, and WGH rules. Finally, data were compared
with those obtained by optical microscopy (OM), as the current gold standard.
RESULTS: The overall the agreement OM classification with ICGH, IS, and WGH panel
rules is 0.83, 0.83, and 0.85, respectively. The false negatives are 2.1%, 3.0%, 
and 2.9%, while false positives are 15.1%, 13.7%, and 11.7%, respectively. All
the seven HAs showed variable interinstrument performance, as three different
criteria for OM review were adopted on each of them from time to time.
CONCLUSION: These results presented show that the customization of validation
rules is necessary for enhancing the quality of hematological testing and
optimizing workflow.
