PURPOSE: To investigate the effects of T-cell-derived cytokines on gene and
protein expression of chemokines in a human RPE cell line (ARPE-19).
METHODS: We used an in vitro coculture system in which the RPE and
CD3/CD28-activated T-cells were separated by a membrane. RPE cell expression of
chemokine genes was quantified using three different types of microarrays.
Protein expression was determined by single and multiplex ELISA and
immunoblotting.
RESULTS: Coculture with activated T-cells increased RPE mRNA and protein
expression of chemokines CCL2 (MCP-1); CCL5 (RANTES); CCL7 (MCP-3); CCL8 (MCP-2);
CXCL1 (GRO-α); IL8 (CXCL8); CXCL9 (MIG); CXCL10 (IP10); CXCL11 (ITAC); and CX3CL1
(fractalkine). CCL7, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were secreted significantly more
in the apical direction. Using recombinant human cytokines and neutralizing
antibodies, we identified IFNγ and TNFα as the two major T-cell-derived cytokines
responsible for the RPE response. For CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16, and
CX3CL1, we observed a synergistic effect of IFNγ and TNFα in combination. CCL20, 
CXCL1, CXCL6, and IL8 were negatively regulated by IFNγ.
CONCLUSIONS: RPE cells responded to exposure to T-cell-derived cytokines by
upregulating expression of multiple chemokines related to microglial, T-cell, and
monocyte chemotaxis and activation. This inflammatory stress response may have
implications for immune homeostasis in the retina, and for the further
understanding of inflammatory ocular diseases such as uveitis and AMD.
