Chemokines represent central players of the innate and adaptive immunity and are 
involved in the regulation of inflammatory events occurring during infectious
complications or during graft vs. host disease (GvHD). Patients after allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) are at a high risk for the development of
acute GvHD or to suffer from fungal infections. Susceptibility to fungal
infections and the course of GvHD can be genetically influenced by single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which regulate expression or biological activity
of chemokines, and therefore have an impact on the outcome of invasive
aspergillosis and GvHD. High lightened studies of abetting factors for GvHD
revealed SNPs in TNFA, IL-6, IL-10, INF-γ, CCL2, CCL5 (RANTES), IL-1Ra, IL-23R,
IL-7Ralpha, IL-10RB, and CCR9 genes as prevalent considerable. Furthermore,
additional SNPs were described to be significantly associated with fungal
infections (Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans), including markers in CCL3, 
CCL4, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL8, CXCL10, CCR1, and CCR2. This review summarizes the
current knowledge about the growing number of genetic markers in chemokine genes 
and their relevance for patients after alloSCT.
