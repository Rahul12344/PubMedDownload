BACKGROUND/AIMS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is reported to be involved in
gastric carcinogenesis. However, only a small percentage of HP-infected patients 
actually develop gastric cancer. In the present study, we assessed HLA antigen
polymorphism and investigated its relationship with the development of gastric
epithelial tumors in patients who had HP infection.
METHODOLOGY: Among patients with serologically proven HP infection, 80 cases who 
underwent endoscopic mucosectomy for gastric epithelial tumors (24 adenomas and
56 carcinomas) were recruited in the study (the tumor group), and 20 cases
without tumors were also included as controls (the nontumor group). HLA status
(HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1) was determined by HLA-DNA typing.
RESULTS: HLA-B*05401, HLA-DQB1*0601 and HLA-DRB1*1502 genes showed a
significantly higher frequency in the control group than in the tumor group
(0.225 vs. 0.088, P=0.015; 0.3 vs. 0.163, P = 0.047; 0.175 vs. 0.069, P = 0.036, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: It suggests that HLA-B*5401, HLA-DQB1*0601 and HLA-DRB1*1502 may
contribute to the inhibition of gastric carcinogenesis. Thus, HP-infected
patients without these genotypes should undergo HP eradication therapy and close 
follow-up.
