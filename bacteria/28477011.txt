Previously, we found that most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
expressed at least one of the leukemic associated antigens (LAAs) WT1, survivin
and TERT, and different combinations of the three LAAs predicted negative
clinical outcomes. Multi-tumor antigen-specific T cells were generated to
overcome antigenic variation and may be sufficient to maximize antitumoral
effects. To generate triple antigen-specific (Tri)-T cells that recognize three
LAAs, dendritic cells (DCs) were transfected with three tumor antigen-encoding
RNAs. These DCs were used to stimulate both CD8 and CD4 T cells and to overcome
the limitation of known human leukocyte antigen-restricted epitopes. The sum of
the antigen-specific T cell frequencies was higher in the Tri-T cells than in the
T cells that recognized a single antigen. Furthermore, the Tri-T cells were more 
effective against leukemic blasts that expressed all three LAAs compared with
blasts that expressed one or two LAAs, suggesting a proportional correlation
between IFN-Î³ secretion and LAA expression. Engrafted leukemic blasts in the bone
marrow of mice significantly decreased in the presence of Tri-T cells. This
technique represents an effective immunotherapeutic strategy in AML.
