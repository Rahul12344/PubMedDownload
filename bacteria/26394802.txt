Whooping cough, or pertussis, incidence has reached levels not seen since the
1950s. Previous studies have shown that antibiotics fail to improve the course of
disease unless diagnosed early. Early diagnosis is complicated by the
non-diagnostic presentation of disease early in infection. This review focuses on
previous attempts at developing novel host-directed therapies for the treatment
of pertussis. In addition, two novel approaches from our group are discussed.
Manipulation of the signaling pathway of sphingosine-1-phosphate, a lipid
involved in many immune processes, has shown great promise, but is in its
infancy. Pendrin, a host epithelial anion exchanger upregulated in the airways
with B. pertussis infection, appears to drive mucus production and dysregulation 
of airway surface liquid pH and salinity. In addition to detailing these
potential new therapeutic targets, the need for greater focus on the neonatal
model of disease is highlighted.
