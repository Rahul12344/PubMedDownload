The ability to grow at moderate acidic conditions (pH 4.0-5.0) is important to
Escherichia coli colonization of the host's intestine. Several regulatory systems
are known to control acid resistance in E. coli, enabling the bacteria to survive
under acidic conditions without growth. Here, we characterize an acid-tolerance
response (ATR) system and its regulatory circuit, required for E. coli
exponential growth at pH 4.2. A two-component system CpxRA directly senses
acidification through protonation of CpxA periplasmic histidine residues, and
upregulates the fabA and fabB genes, leading to increased production of
unsaturated fatty acids. Changes in lipid composition decrease membrane fluidity,
F0F1-ATPase activity, and improve intracellular pH homeostasis. The ATR system is
important for E. coli survival in the mouse intestine and for production of
higher level of 3-hydroxypropionate during fermentation. Furthermore, this ATR
system appears to be conserved in other Gram-negative bacteria.
