Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy appears to be effective in
the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory disease of the
gastrointestinal tract. However, the mechanisms involved are not completely
understood.
Methods: Fifty-seven active CD patients were enrolled, and cytokine profiles in
colonic biopsies of patients with active CD receiving anti-TNF monoclonal
antibody (mAb) (infliximab [IFX]) treatment were determined using quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Colonic biopsies of active CD
patients and healthy donors were cultured with IFX in vitro, and cytokine
profiles were measured by qRT-PCR. Peripheral blood (PB)-CD4+ T cells were
stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs in the presence of human immunoglobin
(HIg), IFX, recombinant human TNF-Î± converting enzyme (rhTACE), and aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) inhibitor (CH-223191), respectively, to determine
interleukin (IL)-22 expression by CD4+ T cells. Caco2 cells were also utilized to
study their potential role in modulating epithelial cell barrier repairs in
vitro.
Results: IFX therapy markedly upregulated IL-22 mRNA expression in the gut mucosa
of CD patients. In vitro treatment with IFX greatly promoted CD CD4+ T cells to
express IL-22, which was inhibited by rhTACE, indicating that reverse signaling
through binding to membrane-bound TNF mediates anti-TNF-induced IL-22 expression 
of CD CD4+ T cells. However, blockade of AhR markedly inhibited anti-TNF-induced 
IL-22+CD4+ T (Th22) cell differentiation in CD patients. Moreover, treatment with
IL-22 induced intestinal epithelial cell expression of tight junction proteins
(eg, claudin1 and ZO-1) and facilitated transepithelial resistance, indicating
that IL-22 protects intestinal mucosa from inflammation via maintenance of
epithelial barrier integrity.
Conclusions: Our results uncover a novel mechanism whereby anti-TNF therapy
upregulates IL-22 production in CD patients through promoting Th22 cell
differentiation and contributes to intestinal epithelial barrier repairs.
