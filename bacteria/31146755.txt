BACKGROUND: Environmental resistomes include transferable microbial genes. One
important resistome component is resistance to arsenic, a ubiquitous and toxic
metalloid that can have negative and chronic consequences for human and animal
health. The distribution of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in the
environment is not well understood. However, microbial communities and their
resistomes mediate key transformations of arsenic that are expected to impact
both biogeochemistry and local toxicity.
RESULTS: We examined the phylogenetic diversity, genomic location (chromosome or 
plasmid), and biogeography of arsenic resistance and metabolism genes in 922 soil
genomes and 38 metagenomes. To do so, we developed a bioinformatic toolkit that
includes BLAST databases, hidden Markov models and resources for gene-targeted
assembly of nine arsenic resistance and metabolism genes: acr3, aioA, arsB, arsC 
(grx), arsC (trx), arsD, arsM, arrA, and arxA. Though arsenic-related genes were 
common, they were not universally detected, contradicting the common conjecture
that all organisms have them. From major clades of arsenic-related genes, we
inferred their potential for horizontal and vertical transfer. Different types
and proportions of genes were detected across soils, suggesting microbial
community composition will, in part, determine local arsenic toxicity and
biogeochemistry. While arsenic-related genes were globally distributed,
particular sequence variants were highly endemic (e.g., acr3), suggesting
dispersal limitation. The gene encoding arsenic methylase arsM was unexpectedly
abundant in soil metagenomes (median 48%), suggesting that it plays a prominent
role in global arsenic biogeochemistry.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis advances understanding of arsenic resistance,
metabolism, and biogeochemistry, and our approach provides a roadmap for the
ecological investigation of environmental resistomes.
