The mechanisms of interaction of inorganic complexes with DNA are important in
the design and development of new metal-based drug molecules. The limitations of 
cis-platin have encouraged the design and development of new metal-based
target-specific anticancer drugs having reduced side effects. The complex
cis-dichloridobis(1,2,5-thiadiazolo[3,4-f][1,10]phenanthroline-Îº2N1,N10)copper(II
), [CuCl2(C12H6N4S)2], has been synthesized and characterized. The complex
crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c. The covalent binding of the
complex with DNA was studied by absorption spectroscopy. The anticancer activity 
of the complex on the Human Lung Carcinoma (A549) cell line was investigated by
MTT assay. The complex exhibits higher toxicity than cis-platin and induces an
apoptotic mode of cell death.
