[Whole-gut irrigation for large bowel preparation in colorectal surgery (author's
transl)].

[Article in German]

Schiessel R.

In a controlled trial with 32 patients, whole-gut irrigation (wgi) was compared
with elemental diet as a method of large-bowel preparation. Cleansing effect,
caloric intake (bad taste of diet), and preparation time were significantly
better in the first group (wgi). Since 1976, 203 patients have undergone wgi.
Investigations concerning the effect of addition of antibiotics to the irrigant
revealed optimum reduction of fecal flora with neomycin--bacitracin--clindamycin.
