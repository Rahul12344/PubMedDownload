OBJECTIVE: Infection of the placenta has been associated with preterm birth as
well as neurocognitive impairment. This study aimed to determine whether specific
bacterial species in the placenta of extremely preterm pregnancies are associated
with neurological deficits later in life.
STUDY DESIGN: Using data from 807 children in the ELGAN study the risks of a low 
score on six neurological assessments in relation to 15 different microbes were
quantified with odds ratios.
RESULTS: The presence of certain microbial species in the placenta was associated
with lower scores on numerical and oral language assessments. Lactobacillus sp.
was associated with decreased risk of a low oral language score and a composite
measure of IQ and executive function.
CONCLUSION: Placental microorganisms were associated with neurocognitive, but not
social-communicative, outcomes at age 10. In contrast, the presence of the
anti-inflammatory Lactobacillus sp. in the placenta was associated with a lower
risk of impaired neurocognitive functions.
