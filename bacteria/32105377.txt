Urea amidolyase (UA), a bifunctional enzyme that is widely distributed in
bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants, plays a pivotal role in the recycling of
nitrogen in the biosphere. Its substrate urea is ultimately converted to
ammonium, via successive catalysis at the C-terminal urea carboxylase (UC) domain
and followed by the N-terminal allophanate hydrolyse (AH) domain. Although our
previous studies have shown that Kluyveromyces lactis UA (KlUA) functions
efficiently as a homodimer, the architecture of the full-length enzyme remains
unresolved. Thus how the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain is
transferred within the UC domain remains unclear. Here we report the structures
of full-length KlUA in its homodimer form in three different functional states by
negatively-stained single-particle electron microscopy. We report here that the
ADP-bound structure with or without urea shows two possible locations of BCCP
with preferred asymmetry, and that when BCCP is attached to the carboxyl
transferase domain of one monomer, it is attached to the biotin carboxylase
domain in the second domain. Based on this observation, we propose a
BCCP-swinging model for biotin-dependent carboxylation mechanism of this enzyme.
