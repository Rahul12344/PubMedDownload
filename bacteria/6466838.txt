The effect of neisserial sensitization on the protein spectra and phospholipid
composition of acetyscholine receptor-rich membrane fragments was investigated in
rat skeletal muscles. The sensitization led to substantial changes in the protein
spectrum of the cell membranes of the skeletal muscles with high receptor
activity in respect to choline. The phospholipid composition of the membranes was
found to experience profound transformations. A considerable increase was noted
in the content of sphingomye lin and phosphatidylcholine together with a marked
drop in the content of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinosite and
phosphatidylserine.
