Melanoma is a predominant cause of skin cancer-related deaths. It was reported
that, the methanolic extract of Pouzolzia Indica (P. indica) on chromatography
gave five compounds (1-hentriacontanyl palmitate, myricyl alcohol,
6,7-dimethoxycoumarin, trichadonic acid and friedelane), which inhibited the
acute promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, NB4, and HT93A. Friedelane was extracted
as active compound from methanolic extract of P. indica. In this study,
friedelane was tested on murine metastatic B16F10 and B16BL6 melanoma cell lines.
To achieve the target, the cell viability using trypan blue exclusion, acridine
orange/EtBr staining and cell cytotoxicity were tested using MTT assay.
Caspase-3, caspase-9, Cyt-c, BAD and Bax protein were assayed to evidence the
apoptosis induction. The compound friedelane shows potent cytotoxic effect
against metastatic melanoma mouse cell lines in 10 µg/ml concentration.
