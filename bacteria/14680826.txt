An efficient system for producing human cytochrome c variants is important to
help us understand the roles of this protein in biological processes relevant to 
human diseases including apoptosis and oxidative stress. Here, we describe an
Escherichia coli expression system for producing recombinant human cytochrome c. 
We also characterize the structure, stability, and function of the protein and
show its utility for studying apoptosis. Yields of greater than 8 mg of pure
protein per liter culture were attained. Circular dichroism spectropolarimetry
studies show that the secondary and tertiary structures of the human protein are 
nearly identical to those of the horse protein, but the human protein is more
stable than other eukaryotic cytochromes c. Furthermore, recombinant human
cytochrome c is capable of inducing caspase-3 activity in a cell-free caspase
activation assay. We use data from this assay along with data from the literature
to define the apaf-1 binding site on human cytochrome c.
