iNKT cells are a subset of innate T cells that recognize glycolipids presented on
CD1d molecules and protect against bacterial infections, including S. pneumoniae.
Using lung intravital imaging, we examined the behavior and mechanism of
pulmonary iNKT cell activation in response to the specific iNKT cell ligand
α-galactosylceramide or S. pneumoniae infection. In untreated mice, the major
fraction of iNKT cells resided in the vasculature, but a small critical
population resided in the extravascular space in proximity to monocyte-derived
DCs. Administration of either α-GalCer or S. pneumoniae induced CD1d-dependent
rapid recruitment of neutrophils out of the vasculature. The neutrophils guided
iNKT cells from the lung vasculature via CCL17. Depletion of monocyte-derived DCs
abrogated both the neutrophil and subsequent iNKT cell extravasation. Moreover,
impairing iNKT cell recruitment by blocking CCL17 increased susceptibility to
S. pneumoniae infection, suggesting a critical role for the influx of iNKT cells 
in host defense.
