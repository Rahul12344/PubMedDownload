Ikaros proteins are pleiotropic regulators of hematopoiesis and are critically
required for the production of lymphocyte and dendritic cell (DC) lineages in
mice. Here, we asked if Ikaros proteins could also play a role in the late stages
of dendritic cell differentiation. Nuclear Ikaros proteins were up-regulated
during the in vitro differentiation of human monocytes into mature DC, suggesting
potential implications in this process. To address this question, a dominant
negative mutant Ikaros isoform IK7 was over-expressed by retroviral gene transfer
in human DC precursor cells, to interfere with the function of Ikaros family
members during DC development. Expression of IK7 in CD34+ cells inhibited the
production of IL-12-producing APCs. The resulting progeny of CD34+ cells and in
particular, committed CD1a+ DC or CD14+ cell-derived DC, expressed low levels of 
MHC class II antigens and of the CD83 maturation marker on the cell surface. Such
IK7-expressing DC induced na√Øve allogeneic T cells to produce Th2 cytokines. Our 
results therefore delineate a new role for Ikaros family members, showing that
normal levels of Ikaros proteins are essential in DC to regulate the terminal
stages of maturation and the capacity to induce optimal Th1 T cell responses.
