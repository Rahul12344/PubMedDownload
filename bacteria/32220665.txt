There is a continuous need to develop new antibacterial agents with
non-traditional mechanisms to combat the nonstop emerging resistance to most of
the antibiotics used in clinical settings. We identified novel pyrazolidinone
derivatives as antibacterial hits in an in-house library screening and
synthesized several derivatives in order to improve the potency and increase the 
polarity of the discovered hit compounds. The oxime derivative 24 exhibited
promising antibacterial activity against E. coli TolC, B. subtilis and S. aureus 
with MIC values of 4, 10 and 20 µg/mL, respectively. The new lead compound 24 was
found to exhibit a weak dual inhibitory activity against both the E. coli MurA
and MurB enzymes with IC50 values of 88.1 and 79.5 µM, respectively, which could 
partially explain its antibacterial effect. A comparison with the previously
reported, structurally related pyrazolidinediones suggested that the oxime
functionality at position 4 enhanced the activity against MurA and recovered the 
activity against the MurB enzyme. Compound 24 can serve as a lead for further
development of novel and safe antibiotics with potential broad spectrum activity.
