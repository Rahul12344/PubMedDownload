The structure and thermal stability of empty and peptide-filled forms of the
murine class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule I-E(k) were
studied at neutral and mildly acidic pH. The two forms have distinct circular
dichroic spectra, suggesting that a conformational change may accompany peptide
binding. Thermal stability profiles indicate that binding of peptide
significantly increases the thermal stability of the empty heterodimers at both
neutral and mildly acidic pH. Free energies calculated from these data provide a 
direct measure of this stabilization and show that the empty form of I-E(k) is
significantly more stable than that of class I MHC proteins. Furthermore, for the
two MHC class II proteins that were analyzed (I-E(k) and I-A(d)), thermal
stability was not significantly altered by acidification. In contrast, of four
class I MHC molecules studied, three have shown a significant loss in complex
stability at low pH. The marked stability exhibited by their empty form, as well 
as their resistance to low pH, as observed in this study, correlate well with the
ability of class II MHC molecules to traverse and bind peptides in acidic
endosomal vesicles.
