Numerous small RNAs regulators of gene expression exist in bacteria. A large
class of them binds to the RNA chaperone Hfq and act by base pairing interactions
with their target mRNA, thereby affecting their translation and/or stability.
They often have multiple direct targets, some of which may be regulators
themselves, and production of a single sRNA can therefore affect the expression
of dozens of genes. We show in this study that the synthesis of the Escherichia
coli pleiotropic PhoPQ two-component system is repressed by MicA, a
sigma(E)-dependent sRNA regulator of porin biogenesis. MicA directly pairs with
phoPQ mRNA in the translation initiation region of phoP and presumably inhibits
translation by competing with ribosome binding. Consequently, MicA downregulates 
several members of the PhoPQ regulon. By linking PhoPQ to sigma(E), our findings 
suggest that major cellular processes such as Mg(2+) transport, virulence, LPS
modification or resistance to antimicrobial peptides are modulated in response to
envelope stress. In addition, we found that Hfq strongly affects the expression
of phoP independently of MicA, raising the possibility that even more sRNAs,
which remain to be identified, could regulate PhoPQ synthesis.
