We previously reported a genetic analysis of heart failure traits in a population
of inbred mouse strains treated with isoproterenol to mimic catecholamine-driven 
cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we apply a co-expression network algorithm, wMICA, to 
perform a systems-level analysis of left ventricular transcriptomes from these
mice. We describe the features of the overall network but focus on a module
identified in treated hearts that is strongly related to cardiac hypertrophy and 
pathological remodeling. Using the causal modeling algorithm NEO, we identified
the gene Adamts2 as a putative regulator of this module and validated the
predictive value of NEO using small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown in
neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Adamts2 silencing regulated the expression of 
the genes residing within the module and impaired isoproterenol-induced cellular 
hypertrophy. Our results provide a view of higher order interactions in heart
failure with potential for diagnostic and therapeutic insights.
