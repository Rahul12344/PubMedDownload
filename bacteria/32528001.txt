The fate of plastic debris entering the oceans is largely unconstrained.
Currently, intensified research is devoted to the abiotic and microbial
degradation of plastic floating near the ocean surface for an extended period of 
time. In contrast, the impacts of environmental conditions in the deep sea on
polymer properties and rigidity are virtually unknown. Here, we present unique
results of plastic items identified to have been introduced into deep-sea
sediments at a water depth of 4150 m in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean more
than two decades ago. The results, including optical, spectroscopic, physical and
microbial analyses, clearly demonstrate that the bulk polymer materials show no
apparent sign of physical or chemical degradation. Solely the polymer surface
layers showed reduced hydrophobicity, presumably caused by microbial
colonization. The bacterial community present on the plastic items differed
significantly (p < 0.1%) from those of the adjacent natural environment by a
dominant presence of groups requiring steep redox gradients (Mesorhizobium,
Sulfurimonas) and a remarkable decrease in diversity. The establishment of
chemical gradients across the polymer surfaces presumably caused these
conditions. Our findings suggest that plastic is stable over extended times under
deep-sea conditions and that prolonged deposition of polymer items at the
seafloor may induce local oxygen depletion at the sediment-water interface.
