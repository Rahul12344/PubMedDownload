Background: Infective endocarditis (IE) is a complex infectious disease with high
morbidity and mortality. The inflammation mechanism of IE is a complex network
including interactions of inflammatory cytokines and other components of host
response. As an important inflammation marker, the prediction ability of
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in IE deserves further investigation.
Methods: NLR values were measured and compared between IE patients and healthy
controls, good and bad clinical outcome groups. The receiver operating
characteristic curves (ROCs) of NLR and cut-off values were measured in IE
patients, pathogen-subgroups, and different clinical outcome groups.
Results: There were 678 IE patients and 2520 healthy controls enrolled in our
study. The number of good and bad clinical outcome patients was 537 and 141,
respectively. The value of NLR was significantly higher in IE patients than
healthy controls (6.29 ± 9.36 vs. 1.87 ± 0.34, p < 0.001), and the area under the
ROC (AUC) was 0.817 (95% CI (0.794, 0.839), p < 0.001). The critical value of NLR
for diagnosis of IE was 2.68, with a sensitivity of 69%, and a specificity of
88%. The value of NLR was significantly higher in bad clinical outcome patients
than in good clinical outcome patients (5.8 ± 6.02 vs. 3.62 ± 2.61, p < 0.001).
The critical value of NLR to predict the outcome of IE was 5.557, with a
sensitivity of 39.0% and a specificity of 85.3%.
Conclusions: NLR is a predictive marker for IE patients, especially in
Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria-infected IE patients. NLR also 
can predict the outcome of IE. Early detecting NLR upon admission may assist in
early diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with IE.
