T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a poor-prognostic neoplasm.
Differentiation stage and immune-effector functions of the underlying tumor cell 
are insufficiently characterized. Constitutive activation of the T-cell leukemia 
1A (TCL1A) oncogene distinguishes the (pre)leukemic cell from regular postthymic 
T cells. We assessed activation-response patterns of the T-PLL lymphocyte and
interrogated the modulatory impact by TCL1A. Immunophenotypic and gene expression
profiles revealed a unique spectrum of memory-type differentiation of T-PLL with 
predominant central-memory stages and frequent noncanonical patterns. Virtually
all T-PLL expressed a T-cell receptor (TCR) and/or CD28-coreceptor without
overrepresentation of specific TCR clonotypes. The highly activated leukemic
cells also revealed losses of negative-regulatory TCR coreceptors (eg, CTLA4).
TCR stimulation of T-PLL cells evoked higher-than-normal cell-cycle transition
and profiles of cytokine release that resembled those of normal memory T cells.
More activated phenotypes and higher TCL1A correlated with inferior clinical
outcomes. TCL1A was linked to the marked resistance of T-PLL to activation- and
FAS-induced cell death. Enforced TCL1A enhanced phospho-activation of TCR
kinases, second-messenger generation, and JAK/STAT or NFAT transcriptional
responses. This reduced the input thresholds for IL-2 secretion in a
sensitizer-like fashion. Mice of TCL1A-initiated protracted T-PLL development
resembled such features. When equipped with epitope-defined TCRs or chimeric
antigen receptors, these Lckpr-hTCL1Atg T cells gained a leukemogenic growth
advantage in scenarios of receptor stimulation. Overall, we propose a model of
T-PLL pathogenesis in which TCL1A enhances TCR signals and drives the
accumulation of death-resistant memory-type cells that use amplified low-level
stimulatory input, and whose loss of negative coregulators additionally maintains
their activated state. Treatment rationales are provided by combined interception
in TCR and survival signaling.
