Genome-wide mapping approaches in diverse populations are powerful tools to
unravel the genetic architecture of complex traits. The main goals of our study
were to investigate the potential and limits to unravel the genetic architecture 
and to identify the factors determining the accuracy of prediction of the
genotypic variation of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat (Triticum
aestivum L.) based on data collected with a diverse panel of 372 European
varieties. The wheat lines were phenotyped in multi-location field trials for FHB
resistance and genotyped with 782 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, and 9k
and 90k single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. We applied genome-wide
association mapping in combination with fivefold cross-validations and observed
surprisingly high accuracies of prediction for marker-assisted selection based on
the detected quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Using a random sample of markers not
selected for marker-trait associations revealed only a slight decrease in
prediction accuracy compared with marker-based selection exploiting the QTL
information. The same picture was confirmed in a simulation study, suggesting
that relatedness is a main driver of the accuracy of prediction in
marker-assisted selection of FHB resistance. When the accuracy of prediction of
three genomic selection models was contrasted for the three marker data sets, no 
significant differences in accuracies among marker platforms and genomic
selection models were observed. Marker density impacted the accuracy of
prediction only marginally. Consequently, genomic selection of FHB resistance can
be implemented most cost-efficiently based on low- to medium-density SNP arrays.
