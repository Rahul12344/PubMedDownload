OBJECTIVE: To study Thy1 as a fibroblast marker, SSEA1 as a marker of
intermediate pluripotency, and Oct4 as a marker of established pluripotency in
rat model of endometriosis.
DESIGN: In vivo animal study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endometriosis was induced in 20 albino female rats through
autologous transplantation of one uterine horn to mesentery of intestine. Other
20 rats had their horn removed without transplantation (controls). Rats were
sacrificed 4 weeks after induction surgery. Ectopic, eutopic, and control
endometria were harvested from endometriosis and control animals respectively.
Quantitative syber green based RT-PCR was used to detect expression of Thy-1
(CD90), FUT4 (SSEA1), and POU5F1 (Oct4) genes in tissues. Relative expression was
normalized to that of β actin. Thy1, SSEA1, and Oct4 protein expression were
detected by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Ectopic endometrium expressed significantly higher mRNA of Oct4 and
SSEA1 as compared to control endometrium. Expression levels of Oct4 and SSEA1
were comparable between ectopic and eutopic endometria and between eutopic and
control endometria. Thy1 (CD90) gene expression level was comparable among
ectopic, eutopic, and control endometria. Oct4 immunoscore were significantly
higher in ectopic (6.6±0.91) than eutopic (2.5±0.78) or control endometrium
(3.7±0.1) (P value 0.02). Thy1 and SSEA1 immunoscores were comparable among all
three types of endometria.
CONCLUSIONS: Using rat model of endometriosis, ectopic endometrium showed
significantly higher Oct4, and SSEA1, but similar Thy1 gene expression to that of
control endometrium. This indicates increased transition from somatic to
pluripotent cell states in ectopic endometrium which may play a role in
endometriosis pathogenesis.
