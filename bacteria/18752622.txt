The deep subseafloor biosphere supports a diverse population of prokaryotes
belonging to the Bacteria and Archaea. Most of the taxonomic groups identified by
molecular methods contain mainly uncultured phylotypes. Despite this several
cultured strains have been isolated from this habitat, but they probably do not
represent the majority of the population. Evidence is starting to suggest that
some of the activities measured, such as sulphate reduction and methanogenesis,
reflected in geochemical profiles, are carried out by a small subset of the
community detected by molecular methods. It is further possible that heterotrophy
may be the most important mode of metabolism in subsurface sediments and
heterotrophic microorganisms could dominate the uncultured prokaryotic
population. Although, heterotrophy is limited by the increasing recalcitrance of 
organic matter with depth, this may be counteracted by thermal activation of
buried organic matter providing additional substrates at depth.
