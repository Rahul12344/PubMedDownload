Esterases are widely used in the food industry. Here, a new thermophilic
bacterium, Geobacillus thermodenitrificans PS01, was isolated and the
esterase-encoding gene est1 was cloned, sequenced, and recombinant expressed in
Escherichia coli Tuner (DE3). The highest activity of recombinant Est1 was
detected at pH 8.0, and 40 °C and the extreme stability was observed at pH 6-9
over 30 days at 4 °C. In particular, Est1 can hydrolyze short- to medium-chain
(C2-C10) triglycerides and p-nitrophenyl esters (C2-C12) and was not inhibited by
most metal ions. Kinetic parameters of p-nitrophenyl butyrate hydrolysis under
optimal conditions were determined: Km, 22.76 μM; kcat, 10,415 s-1; and kcat/Km, 
457.53 μM-1 s-1. The outstanding specification of Est1 indicates its potential
for use in industrial applications.
