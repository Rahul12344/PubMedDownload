AT2433 from Actinomadura melliaura is an indolocarbazole antitumor antibiotic
structurally distinguished by its unique aminodideoxypentose-containing
disaccharide moiety. The corresponding sugar nucleotide-based biosynthetic
pathway for this unusual sugar derives from comparative genomics where AtmS13 has
been suggested as the contributing sugar aminotransferase (SAT). Determination of
the AtmS13 X-ray structure at 1.50-Å resolution reveals it as a member of the
aspartate aminotransferase fold type I (AAT-I). Structural comparisons of AtmS13 
with homologous SATs that act upon similar substrates implicate potential active 
site residues that contribute to distinctions in sugar C5 (hexose vs. pentose)
and/or sugar C2 (deoxy vs. hydroxyl) substrate specificity.
