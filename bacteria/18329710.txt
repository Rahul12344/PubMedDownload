Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) development requires interaction with the
intestinal microbiota. Because murine secondary lymphoid tissue development is
driven by positive feedback interactions between B cells and stromal cells, we
used in situ hybridization to determine whether intestinal commensals influence
such interactions during rabbit appendix development. The features of positive
feedback interactions we examined (CXCL13 mRNA expression, B cell accumulation
and FDC differentiation) increased during early follicle development, but stalled
in the absence of intestinal commensals. These features were reinitiated by
commensals that stimulated follicle development and intrafollicular B cell
proliferation. Our results suggest that rabbit appendix follicles develop in two 
phases: an initial phase of B cell recruitment to nascent follicles, possibly
through positive feedback interactions, and a subsequent phase of intrafollicular
B cell proliferation stimulated by intestinal commensals. In addition, we found
that intestinal commensals stimulate appendix CCL21 mRNA expression and T cell
area formation.
