The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is a phytopathogenic organism that causes citrus
variegated chlorosis, a disease which attacks economically important crops,
mainly oranges. In this communication, the crystallization and preliminary X-ray 
crystallographic analysis of XfSurE, a survival protein E from X. fastidiosa, are
reported. Data were collected for two crystal forms, I and II, to 1.93 and 2.9 Å 
resolution, respectively. Crystal form I belonged to space group C2, with
unit-cell parameters a = 172.36, b = 84.18, c = 87.24 Å, α = γ = 90, β = 96.59°, 
whereas crystal form II belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
88.05, b = 81.26, c = 72.84 Å, α = γ = 90, β = 94.76°.
