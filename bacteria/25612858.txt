BACKGROUND: In adults with acute stroke, infections occur commonly and are
associated with an unfavourable functional outcome. In the Preventive Antibiotics
in Stroke Study (PASS) we aimed to establish whether or not preventive
antimicrobial therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin, ceftriaxone,
improves functional outcome in patients with acute stroke.
METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, open-label trial with masked endpoint
assessment, patients with acute stroke were randomly assigned to intravenous
ceftriaxone at a dose of 2 g, given every 24 h intravenously for 4 days, in
addition to stroke unit care, or standard stroke unit care without preventive
antimicrobial therapy; assignments were made within 24 h after symptom onset. The
primary endpoint was functional outcome at 3 months, defined according to the
modified Rankin Scale and analysed by intention to treat. The primary analysis
was by ordinal regression of the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included
death, infection rates, antimicrobial use, and length of hospital stay.
Participants and caregivers were aware of treatment allocation but assessors of
outcome were masked to group assignment. This trial is registered with
controlled-trials.com, number ISRCTN66140176.
FINDINGS: Between July 6, 2010, and March 23, 2014, a total of 2550 patients from
30 sites in the Netherlands, including academic and non-academic medical centres,
were randomly assigned to the two treatment groups: 1275 patients to ceftriaxone 
and 1275 patients to standard treatment (control group). 12 patients (seven in
the ceftriaxone group and five in the control group) withdrew consent immediately
after randomisation, leaving 2538 patients available for the
intention-to-treat-analysis (1268 in the ceftriaxone group and 1270 in the
control group). 2514 (99%) of 2538 patients (1257 in each group) completed
3-month follow-up. Preventive ceftriaxone did not affect the distribution of
functional outcome scores on the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months (adjusted
common odds ratio 0·95 [95% CI 0·82-1·09], p=0·46). Preventive ceftriaxone did
not result in an increased occurrence of adverse events. Overgrowth infection
with Clostridium difficile occurred in two patients (<1%) in the ceftriaxone
group and none in the control group.
INTERPRETATION: Preventive ceftriaxone does not improve functional outcome at 3
months in adults with acute stroke. The results of our trial do not support the
use of preventive antibiotics in adults with acute stroke.
