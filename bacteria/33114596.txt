Although many studies have been conducted on leukemia, only a few have analyzed
the metabolomic profiles of various leukemic cells. In this study, the
metabolomes of THP-1, U937, KG-1 (acute myelogenous leukemia, AML), K562 (chronic
myelogenous leukemia, CML), and cord blood-derived CD34-positive hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and
specific metabolic alterations were found using multivariate statistical
analysis. Compared to HSCs, leukemia cell metabolomes were found to have
significant alterations, among which three were related to amino acids, three to 
sugars, and five to fatty acids. Compared to CML, four metabolomes were observed 
specifically in AML. Given that overall more metabolites are present in leukemia 
cells than in HSCs, we observed that the activation of glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism facilitated the incidence of leukemia and the
proliferation of leukemic cells. Analysis of metabolome profiles specifically
present in HSCs and leukemia cells greatly increases our basic understanding of
cellular metabolic characteristics, which is valuable fundamental knowledge for
developing novel anticancer drugs targeting leukemia metabolism.
