Recent political unrest has highlighted the importance of understanding the
short- and long-term effects of gamma-radiation exposure on human health and
survivability. In this regard, effective treatment for acute radiation syndrome
(ARS) is a necessity in cases of nuclear disasters. Here, we propose 20
therapeutic targets for ARS identified using a systematic approach that
integrates gene coexpression networks obtained under radiation treatment in
humans and mice, drug databases, disease-gene association, radiation-induced
differential gene expression, and literature mining. By selecting gene targets
with existing drugs, we identified potential candidates for drug repurposing.
Eight of these genes (BRD4, NFKBIA, CDKN1A, TFPI, MMP9, CBR1, ZAP70, IDH3B) were 
confirmed through literature to have shown radioprotective effect upon
perturbation. This study provided a new perspective for the treatment of ARS
using systems-level gene associations integrated with multiple biological
information. The identified genes might provide high confidence drug target
candidates for potential drug repurposing for ARS.
