Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are essential ingredients of
the human diet. They are synthesized by LC-PUFA synthases (PFASs) expressed in
marine bacteria and other organisms. PFASs are large enzyme complexes that are
homologous to mammalian fatty acid synthases and microbial polyketide synthases. 
One subunit of each PFAS harbors consecutive ketosynthase (KSc) and chain length 
factor (CLF) domains that collectively catalyze the elongation of a nascent fatty
acyl chain via iterative carbon-carbon bond formation. We report the X-ray
crystal structure of the KS-CLF didomain from a well-studied PFAS in Moritella
marina. Our structure, in combination with biochemical analysis, provides a
foundation for understanding the mechanism of substrate recognition and chain
length control by the KS-CLF didomain as well as its interaction with a cognate
acyl carrier protein partner.
