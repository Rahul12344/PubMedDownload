Human memory-like NK cells are commonly defined by either a lack of FcεRIγ or
gain of NKG2C expression. Here, we investigated the heterogeneity of human
CD56dim NK cell subpopulations according to the expression of FcεRIγ and NKG2C in
a large cohort (n = 127). Although the frequency of FcεRIγ- and NKG2C+ NK cells
positively correlated, the FcεRIγ- and NKG2C+ NK cell populations did not exactly
overlap. The FcεRIγ+NKG2C+, FcεRIγ-NKG2C+, and FcεRIγ-NKG2C- NK cell populations 
were only evident after HCMV infection, but each had distinct characteristics.
Among the subpopulations, FcεRIγ-NKG2C+ NK cells exhibited the most restricted
killer immunoglobulin-like receptor repertoire, suggesting clonal expansion.
Moreover, FcεRIγ-NKG2C+ NK cells exhibited the lowest Ki-67 and highest Bcl-2
expression, indicating the long-lived quiescent memory-like property.
Functionally, FcεRIγ-NKG2C+ NK cells had weak natural effector function against
K562 but strong effector functions by CD16 engagement, whereas FcεRIγ+NKG2C+ NK
cells had strong effector functions in both settings. Anatomically, the
FcεRIγ+NKG2C+, FcεRIγ-NKG2C+, and FcεRIγ-NKG2C- NK cell populations were present 
in multiple human peripheral organs. In conclusion, we demonstrate the
heterogeneity of memory-like NK cells stratified by FcεRIγ and NKG2C and suggest 
both markers be utilized to better define these cells.
