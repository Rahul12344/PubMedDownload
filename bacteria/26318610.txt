Acyl-CoA mutases are a growing class of adenosylcobalamin-dependent radical
enzymes that perform challenging carbon skeleton rearrangements in primary and
secondary metabolism. Members of this class of enzymes must precisely control
substrate positioning to prevent oxidative interception of radical intermediates 
during catalysis. Our understanding of substrate specificity and catalysis in
acyl-CoA mutases, however, is incomplete. Here, we present crystal structures of 
IcmF, a natural fusion protein variant of isobutyryl-CoA mutase, in complex with 
the adenosylcobalamin cofactor and four different acyl-CoA substrates. These
structures demonstrate how the active site is designed to accommodate the
aliphatic acyl chains of each substrate. The structures suggest that a
conformational change of the 5'-deoxyadenosyl group from C2'-endo to C3'-endo
could contribute to initiation of catalysis. Furthermore, detailed bioinformatic 
analyses guided by our structural findings identify critical determinants of
acyl-CoA mutase substrate specificity and predict new acyl-CoA mutase-catalyzed
reactions. These results expand our understanding of the substrate specificity
and the catalytic scope of acyl-CoA mutases and could benefit engineering efforts
for biotechnological applications ranging from production of biofuels and
commercial products to hydrocarbon remediation.
