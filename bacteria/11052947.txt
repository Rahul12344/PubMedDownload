The effective regulation of T cell responses is dependent on opposing signals
transmitted through two related cell-surface receptors, CD28 and cytotoxic T
lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4). Dimerization of CTLA-4 is required for 
the formation of high-avidity complexes with B7 ligands and for transmission of
signals that attenuate T cell activation. We determined the crystal structure of 
the extracellular portion of CTLA-4 to 2.0 angstrom resolution. CTLA-4 belongs to
the immunoglobulin superfamily and displays a strand topology similar to Valpha
domains, with an unusual mode of dimerization that places the B7 binding sites
distal to the dimerization interface. This organization allows each CTLA-4 dimer 
to bind two bivalent B7 molecules and suggests that a periodic arrangement of
these components within the immunological synapse may contribute to the
regulation of T cell responsiveness.
