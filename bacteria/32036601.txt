Neutrophils are the first responders to inflammation, infection, and injury. As
one of the most abundant leukocytes in the immune system, neutrophils play an
essential role in cancer progression, through multiple mechanisms, including
promoting angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and cancer metastasis. Recent studies 
demonstrating elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios suggest neutrophil as a
potential therapeutic target and biomarker for disease status in cancer. This
chapter will discuss the phenotypic and functional changes in the neutrophil in
the tumor microenvironment, the underlying mechanism(s) of neutrophil facilitated
cancer metastasis, and clinical potential of neutrophils as a
prognostic/diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.
