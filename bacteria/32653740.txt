The aim of this work was to study the role of hepatic metabolism of compensatory 
growth in piglets induced by protein restriction and subsequent protein
realimentation. Thirty-six weaned piglets were randomly distributed in a control 
group and a treatment group. The control group piglets were fed with a normal
protein level diet (18.83% CP) for the entire experimental period (day 1-28). The
treatment group piglets were fed with a protein-restriction diet (13.05% CP) for 
day 1 to day 14, and the diet was restored to normal protein level diet for day
15 to day 28. RNA-seq is used to analyze samples of liver metabolism on day 14
and day 28, respectively. Hepatic RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that some KEGG
signaling pathways involved in glycolipid metabolism (eg, "AMPK signaling
pathway," "insulin signaling pathway," and "glycolysis or gluconeogenesis") were 
significantly enriched on day 14 and day 28. On day 14, protein restriction
promoted hepatic lipogenesis by increasing the genes expression level of ACACA,
FASN, GAPM, and SREBP1C, decreasing protein phosphorylation levels of AMPKɑ and
ACC in AMPK signaling pathway. In contrast, on day 28, protein realimentation
promoted hepatic gluconeogenesis by increasing the concentration of G6Pase and
PEPCK, decreasing protein phosphorylation levels of IRS1, Akt, and FoXO1 in
insulin signaling pathway. In addition, protein realimentation activated the
GH-IGF1 axis between the liver and skeletal muscle. Overall, these findings
revealed the importance of liver metabolism in achieving compensatory growth.
