Many gram-negative bacteria are killed after treatment with normal non-immune
sera and directly bind and activate C1 in the absence of antibodies. For the
immediate killing of such serum-sensitive bacteria, like R-forms of Salmonella
strains, all serum complement components are essential. When purified serum C1 to
C9 are used, further activation of the cascade requires an additional serum
factor. This glycoprotein differs from antibody and mediates the attachment of
C4b to the bacterial cell surface. The antibody-independent interaction with C1
occurs via C1q, which binds to LPS. In addition outer membrane proteins bind C1q 
and C1. The association of these porins with LPS may potentiate the
antibody-independent C1q and C1 binding to serum-sensitive bacteria. Porins can
contribute to complement activation mainly through the classical pathway. LPS and
porins from bacterial cell walls are also involved in the binding of
gram-negative bacteria to macrophages. This antibody-independent attachment and
ingestion of gram-negative bacteria is mediated by endogenous macrophage-membrane
associated C1q.
