ZAP-70 deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive form of combined immunodeficiency
(CID) characterized by selective absence of circulating CD8 T cells with low,
normal, or increased CD4 T cells in peripheral blood. Up to now, 14 unique
mutations in the ZAP70 gene have been identified in patients with ZAP-70-related 
CID. We present a 3-year-old boy with a history of recurrent bacterial infections
and autoimmunity. Initial laboratory findings showed a normal total lymphocyte
count, but low levels of CD8 and CD4 T cells and an abnormal lymphocyte
proliferation response. Immunoglobulin levels were normal, but the specific
antibody response was impaired. Whole exome sequencing revealed a mutation within
the kinase domain of ZAP-70. ZAP-70 deficiency should be considered in infants
and young children with recurrent bacterial infections, in spite of having
palpable lymph nodes, a notable thymus shadow, and a normal total lymphocyte
count.
