PURPOSE: The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-MET and its ligand hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) are deregulated and promote malignancy in cancer and brain
tumors. Consequently, clinically applicable c-MET inhibitors have been developed.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the not-well-known molecular
determinants that predict responsiveness to c-MET inhibitors and to explore new
strategies for improving inhibitor efficacy in brain tumors.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the molecular factors and pathway activation
signatures that determine sensitivity to c-MET inhibitors in a panel of
glioblastoma and medulloblastoma cells, glioblastoma stem cells, and established 
cell line-derived xenografts using functional assays, reverse protein
microarrays, and in vivo tumor volume measurements, but validation with animal
survival analyses remains to be done. We also explored new approaches for
improving the efficacy of the inhibitors in vitro and in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that HGF coexpression is a key predictor of response to c-MET
inhibition among the examined factors and identified an ERK/JAK/p53 pathway
activation signature that differentiates c-MET inhibition in responsive and
nonresponsive cells. Surprisingly, we also found that short pretreatment of cells
and tumors with exogenous HGF moderately but statistically significantly enhanced
the antitumor effects of c-MET inhibition. We observed a similar ligand-induced
sensitization effect to an EGF receptor small-molecule kinase inhibitor.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings allow the identification of a subset of patients that
will be responsive to c-MET inhibition and propose ligand pretreatment as a
potential new strategy for improving the anticancer efficacy of RTK inhibitors.
