BACKGROUND: Different cell populations from bone marrow were used in various
clinical trials for cardiac diseases during last decade. Four clinical studies
are ongoing in our institution and enroll patients with cardiac diseases,
coronary disease, type 2 diabetes, and osteoarthritis. The density gradient is
used to separate bone marrow mononuclear cells. Joint replacement procedures were
associated with significant loss of tissue. Usually, excess tissue as bone
marrow, peripheral blood and fat are removed to clean operation site. The aim of 
this study is to prove whether removed tissue during joint replacement procedure 
can be considered as a significant source of mononuclear cells.
METHODS: Excised tissue obtained during joint replacement procedure was collected
by AutoLog system. Bone marrow tissue was collected by iliac crest puncture.
Mononuclear cells from both sources were isolated by using Ficoll density
gradient centrifugation. Flow cytometry was used to detect mononuclear cell,
CD34+ population counts and cell viability. Tissue processing yields between the 
group of joint replacement and iliac crest puncture group were compared.
RESULTS: Together, 34 bone marrow tissue processings were performed. On average, 
samples contained 46.31 ± 9.35 ml of bone marrow solution. Average cell yield in 
final product was 28.64 ± 9.35 × 106 MNCs and 0.77 ± 1.51 × 106 CD34+ population.
In case of tissue removed during joint replacement nine processings were
performed. On average samples contained 450 ± 157.69 ml of tissue solution.
Average cell yield in final product was 76.67 ± 35.42 × 106 MNCs and
1.33 ± 0.97 × 106 CD34+ population.
CONCLUSIONS: Tissue processing analysis shows that tissue removed during joint
replacement procedure can be assumed as a significant source of mononuclear
cells. Methods used for bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell extraction can be
applied to the excess tissue.
