Catalytic (SH1) domains of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) demonstrate
specificity for peptide substrates. Whether SH1 domains differentiate between
tyrosines in a physiological substrate has not been confirmed. Using purified
proteins, we studied the ability of Syk, Fyn, and Abl to differentiate between
tyrosines in a common PTK substrate, c-Cbl. We found that each kinase produced a 
distinct pattern of c-Cbl phosphorylation, which altered the
phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions between c-Cbl and CrkL or
phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K). Our data support the concept that SH1
domains determine the final sites of phosphorylation once PTKs reach their target
proteins.
