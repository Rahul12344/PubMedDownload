Multidrug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) is one of the major causes of hospital-acquired and community infections
and pose a challenge to the human health care system. Therefore, it is important 
to find new drugs that show activity against these bacteria, both in monotherapy 
and in combination with other antimicrobial drugs. Gliotoxin (GT) is a mycotoxin 
produced by Aspergillus fumigatus and other fungi of the Aspergillus genus. Some 
evidence suggests that GT shows antimicrobial activity against S. aureus in
vitro, albeit its efficacy against multidrug-resistant strains such asMRSA or
vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strainsis not known. This work aimedto
evaluate the antibiotic efficacy of GT as monotherapy or in combination with
other therapeutics against MRSA in vitro and in vivo using a Caenorhabditis
elegans infection model.
