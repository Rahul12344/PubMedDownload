A large number of Escherichia coli cells become viable but nonculturable at early
stationary phase, most of which are directed to lysis in cells with an enhanced
active σ(E) level. In this study, we examined the effect of small noncoding RNAs,
MicA and RybB, as σ(E) regulon as well as regulators of outer membrane protein
(Omp) genes, on the lysis process. micA- and rybB-disrupted mutations almost
completely suppressed the cell lysis. Increased expression of micA and rybB or
disrupted mutation of ompA, ompC and ompW led to a significant level of cell
lysis. The suppression by Mg(2+) was found to maintain the integrity of the
Omp-repressed outer membrane. Taken together, the results suggest that the cell
lysis proceeds in the cascade of σ(E) → expression of micA and rybB → reduction
in Omp proteins → disintegration of the outer membrane.
