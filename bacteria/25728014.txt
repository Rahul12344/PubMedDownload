Prenatal exposure to cocaine is a significant source of fetal and neonatal
developmental defects. While cocaine associated neurological and cardiac
pathologies are well-documented, it is apparent that cocaine use has far more
diverse physiological effects. It is known that in some cell types, the sigma-1
receptor mediates many of cocaine's cellular effects. Here we present a novel and
concise investigation into the mechanism that underlies cocaine associated
hematopoietic pathology. Indeed, this is the first examination of the effects of 
cocaine on hematopoiesis. We show that cocaine impairs multilineage hematopoiesis
from human progenitors from multiple donors and tissue types. We go on to present
the first demonstration of the expression of the sigma-1 receptor in human CD34 +
human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these
cocaine-induced hematopoietic defects can be reversed through sigma-1 receptor
blockade.
