The CD24 cell surface receptor promotes apoptosis in developing B cells, and we
recently found that it induces B cells to release plasma membrane-derived,
CD24-bearing microvesicles (MVs). Here we have performed a systematic
characterization of B cell MVs released from WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells in
response to CD24 stimulation. We found that B cells constitutively release MVs of
approximately 120 nm, and that CD24 induces an increase in
phosphatidylserine-positive MV release. RNA cargo is predominantly comprised of
5S rRNA, regardless of stimulation; however, CD24 causes a decrease in the
incorporation of protein coding transcripts. The MV proteome is enriched with
mitochondrial and metabolism-related proteins after CD24 stimulation; however,
these changes were variable and could not be fully validated by Western blotting.
CD24-bearing MVs carry Siglec-2, CD63, IgM, and, unexpectedly, Ter119, but not
Siglec-G or MHC-II despite their presence on the cell surface. CD24 stimulation
also induces changes in CD63 and IgM expression on MVs that is not mirrored by
the changes in cell surface expression. Overall, the composition of these MVs
suggests that they may be involved in releasing mitochondrial components in
response to pro-apoptotic stress with changes to the surface receptors
potentially altering the cell type(s) that interact with the MVs.
