SVIP (small p97/VCP-interacting protein) was initially identified as one of many 
cofactors regulating the valosin containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ ATPase
involved in endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Our
previous study showed that SVIP is expressed exclusively in the nervous system.
In the present study, SVIP and VCP were seen to be co-localized in neuronal cell 
bodies. Interestingly, we also observed that SVIP co-localizes with myelin basic 
protein (MBP) in compact myelin, where VCP was absent. Furthermore, using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic measurements, 
we determined that SVIP is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). However,
upon binding to the surface of membranes containing a net negative charge, the
helical content of SVIP increases dramatically. These findings provide structural
insight into interactions between SVIP and myelin membranes.
