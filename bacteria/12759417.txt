Although costimulation plays an important role in activating naive T cells, its
role in negative selection is controversial. By following thymocyte deletion
induced by endogenous superantigens in mice lacking B7-1 and/or B7-2, we have
identified a role for both B7-1 and B7-2 in negative selection. Studies using
CD28-deficient and CD28/CTLA-4-double-deficient mice have revealed that either
CD28 or another as yet undefined coreceptor can mediate these B7-dependent
signals that promote negative selection. Finally, CTLA-4 delivers signals that
inhibit selection, suggesting that CTLA-4 and CD28 have opposing functions in
thymic development. Combined, the data demonstrate that B7-1/B7-2-dependent
signals help shape the T cell repertoire.
