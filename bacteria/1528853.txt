An important family of regulatory molecules is made up of proteins that possess
the DNA-binding and dimerization motif known as the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)
domain. The bHLH family includes subgroups of closely related proteins that share
common functional properties and overlapping patterns of expression (e.g., the
MyoD1 and achaete-scute subgroups). In this report we describe HEN1 and HEN2,
mammalian genes that encode a distinct subgroup of bHLH proteins. The HEN1 gene
was identified on the basis of cross-hybridization with TAL1, a known bHLH gene
implicated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In situ fluorescence
hybridization was used to localize the human HEN1 gene to chromosome band 1q22.
HEN1 and HEN2 are coexpressed in the IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cell line, and
they encode highly related proteins of 133 and 135 residues, respectively, that
share 98% amino acid identity in their hHLH domains. These data imply that the
bHLH protein subgroup encoded by HEN1 and HEN2 may serve important regulatory
functions in the developing nervous system.
