Oral malodor (halitosis, bad breath) is a condition affecting millions of
Americans. In healthy individuals complaining of bad breath, the mouth is the
main source of their oral malodor, more specifically the posterior dorsum of the 
tongue. Nonoral sources should also be considered. It is always easy to recognize
halitosis, but identifying the exact cause is more complex.
