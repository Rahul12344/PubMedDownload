The geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is expected to be an important
component of future global carbon emission mitigation, but there is a need to
understand the impacts of a CO2 leak on the marine environment and to develop
monitoring protocols for leakage detection. In the present study, sediment cores 
were exposed to CO2-acidified seawater at one of five pH levels (8.0, 7.5, 7.0,
6.5 and 6.0) for 10 weeks. A bloom of Spirulina sp. and diatoms appeared on
sediment surface exposed to pH 7.0 and 7.5 seawater. Quantitative PCR
measurements of the abundance of 16S rRNA also indicated an increase within the
pH 7.0 and 7.5 treatments after 10 weeks incubation. More detailed analysis of
the microbial communities from the pH 7.0, 7.5 and 8.0 treatments confirmed an
increase in the relative abundance of Spirulina sp. and Navicula sp. sequences,
with changes in the relative abundance of major archaeal and bacterial groups
also detected within the pH 7.0 treatment. A decreased flux of silicate from the 
sediment at this pH was also detected. Monitoring blooms of microphytobenthos may
prove useful as an indicator of CO2 leakage within coastal areas.
