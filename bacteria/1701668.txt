In the hematopoietic system, the B-cell associated antigen CD24 is expressed at
high density on B cells, B-cell precursors, and B-cell malignancies as well as at
low density on peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The 42-Kd
sialoglycoprotein has not been previously demonstrated to be expressed on T
cells, thymocytes, or T-cell malignancies. We identified three patients with
mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome that showed low density expression of the
CD24-related epitope recognized by antibody BA-1 on circulating T cells. All
three patients had Sézary cells by morphologic assessment and clonal T-cell
populations in the peripheral blood by gene rearrangement studies. In two of
these patients, indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of six anti-CD24
monoclonal antibodies demonstrated reactivity for two of six antibodies in one
case and only one of six antibodies in the other. The biologic significance of
CD24-related epitope expression on circulating T cells in mycosis
fungoides/Sézary syndrome is unclear. However, these findings suggest that
differential, low density expression of CD24-related epitopes (BA-1+, OKB2-) may 
be a useful phenotypic marker for identifying circulating Sézary cells.
