Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have a significantly increased risk
for the development of lung cancer. The morbidity and mortality of this disease
combination are substantial, and, unfortunately, there are currently few data to 
help guide clinicians in its diagnosis and treatment. In a recent issue of this
journal, Hwang et al presented one of the first studies to evaluate lung cancer
in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at the molecular level. They
demonstrate variants in regulators of the cell cycle, which are known to be
important in malignant transformation and may also be important in the
pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Further understanding of the
pathogenic overlap between lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis could
help point the direction to specific diagnostic modalities and targeted treatment
of both conditions in the future. Copyright © 2017 Pathological Society of Great
