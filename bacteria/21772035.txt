NKT cells that express the semi-invariant TCR are innate-like lymphocytes whose
functions are regulated by self and foreign glycolipid ligands presented by the
Ag-presenting, MHC class I-like molecule CD1d. Activation of NKT cells in vivo
results in rapid release of copious amounts of effector cytokines and chemokines 
with which they regulate innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens,
certain types of cancers, and self-antigens. The nature of CD1d-restricted
ligands, the manner in which they are recognized, and the unique effector
functions of NKT cells suggest an immunoregulatory role for this T cell subset.
Their ability to respond fast and our ability to steer NKT cell cytokine response
to altered lipid ligands make them an important target for vaccine design and
immunotherapies against autoimmune diseases. This review summarizes our current
understanding of CD1d-restricted ligand recognition by NKT cells and how these
innate-like lymphocytes regulate inflammation.
