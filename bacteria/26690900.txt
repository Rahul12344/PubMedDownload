STUDY HYPOTHESIS: In women with preterm premature rupture of the membranes
(PPROM), increased oxidative stress may accelerate premature cellular senescence,
senescence-associated inflammation and proteolysis, which may predispose them to 
rupture.
STUDY FINDING: We demonstrate mechanistic differences between preterm birth (PTB)
and PPROM by revealing differences in fetal membrane redox status, oxidative
stress-induced damage, distinct signaling pathways and senescence activation.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Oxidative stress-associated fetal membrane damage and cell
cycle arrest determine adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous PTB and
PPROM.
STUDY DESIGN, SAMPLES/MATERIALS, METHODS: Fetal membranes and amniotic fluid
samples were collected from women with PTB and PPROM. Molecular, biochemical and 
histologic markers were used to document differences in oxidative stress and
antioxidant enzyme status, DNA damage, secondary signaling activation by
Ras-GTPase and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and activation of senescence
between membranes from the two groups.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Oxidative stress was higher and antioxidant 
enzymes were lower in PPROM compared with PTB. PTB membranes had minimal DNA
damage and showed activation of Ras-GTPase and ERK/JNK signaling pathway with
minimal signs of senescence. PPROM had higher numbers of cells with DNA damage,
prosenescence stress kinase (p38 MAPK) activation and signs of senescence.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Samples were obtained retrospectively after
delivery. The markers of senescence that we tested are specific but are not
sufficient to confirm senescence as the pathology in PPROM.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Oxidative stress-induced DNA damage and
senescence are characteristics of fetal membranes from PPROM, compared with PTB
with intact membranes. PTB and PPROM arise from distinct pathophysiologic
pathways. Oxidative stress and oxidative stress-induced cellular damages are
likely determinants of the mechanistic signaling pathways and phenotypic outcome.
