This year eradication of H. pylori was applied for not only peptic ulcer but also
chronic gastritis on National insurance system. However recently decrease in
first line eradication rate of H. pylori using PPI/AC regimen. Certainly
eradication rate after 2000 decreased in intention to treat (ITT) and per
protocol(PP) compared to that before 2000. This tendency was induced by increase 
in CAM-resistant H. pylori. But after 2007 eradication rate decreased only in
ITT, eradication rate didn't decrease in PP. That tendency was induced by bad
compliance and evaluation of the eradication.
