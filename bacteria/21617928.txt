When Pseudomonas mendocina NK-01 was cultivated in a 200-L fermentor using
glucose as carbon source, 0.316 g L(-1) medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate 
(PHA(MCL)) and 0.57 g L(-1) alginate oligosaccharides (AO) were obtained at the
end of the process. GC/MS was used to characterize the PHA(MCL), which was found 
to be a polymer mainly consisting of 3HO (3-hydroxyoctanoate) and 3HD
(3-hydroxydecanoate). T (m) and T (g) values for the PHA(MCL) were 51.03 °C and
-41.21 °C, respectively, by DSC. Its decomposition temperature was about 300 °C. 
The elongation at break was 700% under 12 MPa stress. MS and GPC were also
carried out to characterize the AO which had weight-average molecular weights of 
1,546 and 1,029 Da, respectively, for the two main components at the end of the
fermentation process. MS analysis revealed that the AO were consisted of
β-D-mannuronic acid and/or α-L-guluronic acid, and the β-D-mannuronic acid and/or
α-L-guluronic acid residues were partially acetylated at position C2 or C3.
