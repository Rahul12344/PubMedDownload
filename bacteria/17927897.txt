In this report, we describe an optimized method for generation of ephA8 BAC
transgenic mice expressing the lacZ reporter gene under ephA8 regulatory
sequences. First, we constructed a targeting vector that carries a 1.2 kb ephA8
DNA upstream of its first exon, a lacZ expression cassette, a kanamycin cassette,
and a 0.7 kb ephA8 DNA downstream of its first exon. Second, the targeting vector
was electroporated into cells containing the ephA8 BAC and pKOBEGA, in which
recombinases induce a homologous recombination between the ephA8 BAC DNA and the 
targeting vector. Third, the FLP plasmid expressing the Flipase was
electroporated into these bacteria to eliminate a kanamycin cassette from the
recombinant BAC DNA. The appropriate structures of the modified ephA8 BAC DNA
were confirmed by Southern analysis. Finally, BAC transgenic mouse embryos were
generated by pronuclear injection of the recombinant BAC DNA. Whole mount X-gal
staining revealed that the lacZ reporter expression is restricted to the anterior
region of the developing midbrain in each transgenic embryo. These results
indicate that the ephA8 BAC DNA contains most, if not all, regulatory sequences
to direct temporal and spatial expression of the lacZ gene in vivo.
