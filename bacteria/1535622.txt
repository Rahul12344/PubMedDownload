The ars operon of the conjugative R-factor R773 encodes an oxyanion pump that
catalyzes extrusion of arsenicals from cells of Escherichia coli. The oxyanion
translocation ATPase is composed of two polypeptides, the catalytic ArsA protein 
and the intrinsic membrane protein, ArsB. The topology of regions of the ArsB
protein in the inner membrane was determined using a variety of gene fusions.
Random gene fusions with lacZ and phoA were generated using transposon
mutagenesis. A series of gene fusions with blaM were constructed in vitro using a
beta-lactamase fusion vector. To localize individual segments of the ArsB
protein, a ternary fusion method was developed, where portions of the arsB gene
were inserted in-frame between the coding regions for two heterologous proteins, 
in this case a portion of a newly identified arsD gene and the blaM sequence
encoding the mature beta-lactamase. The location of a periplasmic loop was
determined from V8 protease digestion of an ArsA-ArsB chimera. From analysis of
data from 26 fusions, a topological model of the ArsB protein with 12
membrane-spanning regions is proposed.
