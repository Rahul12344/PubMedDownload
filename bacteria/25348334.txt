Psoriasis is not an autoimmune disease?

The concept that psoriasis is an autoimmune disease needs to be questioned. The
autoimmune label has been based on molecular mimicry between streptococcal and
keratin proteins and the existence of homologous peptides between these proteins.
However, it is only peripheral blood CD8, and not CD4, T lymphocytes that respond
to the homologous peptides. This ignores the fact that it is CD4 T cells which
are necessary to initiate psoriasis. Recent studies on skin bacterial microbiota 
have found a variety of bacteria in both normal skin and psoriatic lesions. In
biopsy specimens, the most common phylum was Firmicutes and the most common genus
streptococcus in both psoriasis and normal skin. The innate immune system is
activated in psoriasis, and recent genetic findings have shown the majority of
susceptibility loci are associated with innate immunity. There is a known
clinical relationship between both Crohn's disease (CD) and periodontitis, and
psoriasis, and patients with psoriasis share mutations in some innate immunity
genes with individuals with CD. It is now accepted that CD is due to a breakdown 
of immune tolerance (dysbiosis) to bacteria in the intestine. These findings
suggest that psoriasis is initiated by an abnormal response to bacteria in the
skin due to genetic factors.
