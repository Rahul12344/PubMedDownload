An orange-coloured myxobacterium, MNa11734T, was isolated from desert in Iran.
MNa11734T had rod-shaped vegetative cells, moved by gliding and was
bacteriolytic. No real fruiting body formation could be observed, but
sporangioles were produced on water agar. The strain was mesophilic, strictly
aerobic and chemoheterotrophic. 16S rRNA gene analyses revealed that MNa11734T
belonged to the family Nannocystaceae, genus Nannocystis and was closely related 
to Nannocystis pusilla Na p29T (DSM 14622T) and Nannocystis exedens Na e1T (DSM
71T), with 97.8 and 97.6 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively.
Laboratory-measured DNA-DNA hybridization showed only 9.5/15.7 % (reciprocal)
similarity between the novel strain and N. pusilla Na p29T, and 14.1/20.4 %
between the strain and N. exedens Na e1T, whereas DNA-DNA hybridization estimates
derived from draft genome sequences were 21.8-23.0 % and 22.2-23.7 %,
respectively, depending on the calculation method. The G+C content of DNA from
Nannocystis konarekensis MNa11734T was 73.3 mol%, for N. pusilla Nap29T it was
71.8 mol% and for N. exedens Nae1T it was 72.2 mol%. The major fatty acids of the
new strain were C16 : 1 (56.2 %), iso-C17 : 0 (14.4 %), C14 : 0 (8.2 %), C16 : 0 
(6.6 %) and iso-C15 : 0 (5.9 %). Strain MNa11734T exhibited phylogenetic and
physiological similarities to the two other species of Nannocystis, i.e. N.
pusilla and N. exedens, but the differences were sufficient enough to represent a
novel species, for which the name Nannocystiskonarekensis sp. nov. is proposed.
The type strain is MNa11734T (=DSM 104509T=NCCB 100618T).
