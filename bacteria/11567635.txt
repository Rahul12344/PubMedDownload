In this report, we show that the Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) plays an
important role in thymocyte development. SLAP expression is developmentally
regulated; it is low in CD4-CD8- thymocytes, it peaks in the CD4+CD8+ subset, and
it decreases to low levels in more mature cells. Disruption of the SLAP gene
leads to a marked upregulation of TCR and CD5 expression at the CD4+CD8+ stage.
The absence of SLAP was also developmentally significant because it enhanced
positive selection in mice expressing the DO11.10 transgenic T cell receptor.
Moreover, SLAP deletion at least partially rescued the development of
ZAP-70-deficient thymocytes. These results demonstrate that SLAP participates in 
a novel mechanism of TCR downregulation at the CD4+CD8+ stage and regulates
positive selection.
