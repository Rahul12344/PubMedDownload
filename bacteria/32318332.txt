The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway is a member of the TGFβ signaling
family and has complex roles in cancer. BMP signaling is rarely mutated and can
be frequently overexpressed in many human cancers. The dichotomous role of BMPs
as both tumor promoters and suppressors appears to be largely context based in
both the cancer cell and the surrounding microenvironment. Myeloid cells
including macrophages and neutrophils have been shown to be tumor promoting when 
stimulated from BMPs. We found that conditional deletion of BMPR1a in myeloid
cells (LysMCre) restricts tumor progression in a syngeneic mouse prostate cancer 
model. Specific changes occurred in myeloid cells both in tumor bearing mice and 
tumor naïve mice throughout multiple tissues. We profiled myeloid subsets in the 
bone marrow, spleen and primary tumor and found myeloid BMPR1a loss altered the
differentiation and lineage capability of distinct populations by histologic,
flow cytometry and high dimensional mass cytometry analysis. We further confirmed
the requirement for BMP signaling with pharmacologic inhibition of THP-1 and
Raw264.7 activated into M2 macrophages with the BMP inhibitor DMH1. M2 polarized 
primary bone marrow derived cells from LysMCre BMPR1a knockout mice indicated a
distinct requirement for BMP signaling in myeloid cells during M2 activation.
These results indicate a unique necessity for BMP signaling in myeloid cells
during tumor progression.
