BACKGROUND: Chronic infections have been proposed to play a role in the aetiology
or progression of atherosclerotic plaques. Increased risk of coronary artery
disease has been suggested in patients seropositive for Helicobacter pylori.
AIM: To analyse coronary specimens in patients with severe (coronary artery
disease) for Helicobacter pylori specific DNA.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Atherosclerotic plaques were obtained in 46 consecutive
patients (9 female, 37 male, mean age 62.7+/-9.17 years) during coronary bypass
procedures. Serum was analysed for IgG -/cagA-antibodies specific for
Helicobacter pylori. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis were used to
identify bacterial DNA. Coronary artery biopsies from 19 autopsies without
coronary artery disease were examined as a control group.
RESULTS: Of the 46 coronary artery disease patients, 32 (69.6%) were Helicobacter
pylori seropositive. Positive results for Helicobacter pylori DNA showed 18
seropositive and 4 seronegative (with anamnesis of eradication therapy). A total 
of 22 patients (47.8%) of the coronary artery disease group but none of controls 
revealed positive DNA. In the coronary artery disease group, a correlation
between DNA presence and prior myocardial infarction (p=0.008) and unstable
angina (p<0.001) was found.
CONCLUSION: Identification of DNA in atherosclerotic plaques of patients with
severe coronary artery disease supports the hypothesis that Helicobacter pylori
infection may influence the development of atherosclerosis. Our results may
indicate an direct involvement of Helicobacter pylori in the progression and
instability of plaques in these patients.
