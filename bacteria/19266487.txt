Human invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are a unique subset of T cells, which recognize 
glycolipids presented by the CD1d. Among the iNKT cells, several functionally
distinct subsets have been characterized according to CD4 and/or CD8 co-receptor 
expression. The current study is focussed on the CD4(+) iNKT cell subset and its 
role in an anti-infectious response. We have examined the role of CD4(+) iNKT
cells on the intracellular Brucella suis growth. Our results indicate that CD4(+)
iNKT cells impair the intramacrophagic growth of Brucella. This inhibition is due
to a combination of soluble and contact-dependent mechanisms: IFN-gamma is weakly
involved while cytotoxic activities such as the induction of the Fas pathway and 
the release of lytic granules are major mechanisms. The impairment of Brucella
growth by CD4(+) iNKT cells requires an interaction with CD1d on macrophage
surface. Also, we have shown that although CD4 regulates several biological
responses of CD4(+) iNKT cells, it is not involved in their antibacterial
activity. Here, we have shown for the first time that the CD4(+) iNKT cell
population has antibacterial activity and thus, participates directly in the
elimination of bacteria and/or in the control of bacterial growth by killing
infected cells.
