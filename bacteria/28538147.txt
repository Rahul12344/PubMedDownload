Ubiquitin-specific protease 25 (Usp25) is a deubiquitinase that is involved in
multiple biological processes. The N-terminal ubiquitin-binding region (UBR) of
Usp25 contains one ubiquitin-associated domain, one small ubiquitin-like modifier
(SUMO)-interacting motif and two ubiquitin-interacting motifs. Previous studies
suggest that the covalent sumoylation in the UBR of Usp25 impairs its enzymatic
activity. Here, we raise the hypothesis that non-covalent binding of SUMO, a
prerequisite for efficient sumoylation, will impair Usp25's catalytic activity as
well. To test our hypothesis and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism, we
investigated the structure and function of the Usp25 N-terminal UBR. The solution
structure of Usp251-146 is obtained, and the key residues responsible for
recognition of ubiquitin and SUMO2 are identified. Our data suggest inhibition of
Usp25's catalytic activity upon the non-covalent binding of SUMO2 to the Usp25
SUMO-interacting motif. We also find that SUMO2 can competitively block the
interaction between the Usp25 UBR and its ubiquitin substrates. Based on our
findings, we have proposed a working model to depict the regulatory role of the
Usp25 UBR in the functional display of the enzyme.
