KEY MESSAGE: Compared with independent validation, cross-validation
simultaneously sampling genotypes and environments provided similar estimates of 
accuracy for genomic selection, but inflated estimates for marker-assisted
selection. Estimates of prediction accuracy of marker-assisted (MAS) and genomic 
selection (GS) require validations. The main goal of our study was to compare the
prediction accuracies of MAS and GS validated in an independent sample with
results obtained from fivefold cross-validation using genomic and phenotypic data
for Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat. In addition, the applicability of
the reliability criterion, a concept originally developed in the context of
classic animal breeding and GS, was explored for MAS. We observed that prediction
accuracies of MAS were overestimated by 127% using cross-validation sampling
genotype and environments in contrast to independent validation. In contrast,
prediction accuracies of GS determined in independent samples are similar to
those estimated with cross-validation sampling genotype and environments. This
can be explained by small population differentiation between the training and
validation sets in our study. For European wheat breeding, which is so far
characterized by a slow temporal dynamic in allele frequencies, this assumption
seems to be realistic. Thus, GS models used to improve European wheat populations
are expected to possess a long-lasting validity. Since quantitative trait loci
information can be exploited more precisely if the predicted genotype is more
related to the training population, the reliability criterion is also a valuable 
tool to judge the level of prediction accuracy of individual genotypes in MAS.
