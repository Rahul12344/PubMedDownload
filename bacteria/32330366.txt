AIM: To express amylomaltase from Thermus filiformis (TfAM) in a generally
recognized as safe (GRAS) organism and to use the enzyme in starch modification.
METHODS AND RESULTS: TfAM was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using 2%
(w/v) galactose inducer under GAL1 promoter. The enzyme was thermostable with
high disproportionation and cyclization activities. The main large-ring
cyclodextrin (CD) products were CD24-CD29, with CD26 as maximum at all incubation
times. TfAM was used to modify cassava and pea starches, the amylose content
decreased 18% and 30%, respectively, when 5% (w/v) starch was treated with
0·5 U TfAM g-1 starch. The increase in short branched chain (DP, degree of
polymerization, 1-5) and the broader chain length distribution pattern which
extended to the longer chain (DP40) after TfAM treatment were observed. The
thermal property was changed, with an increase in retrogradation of starch as
suggested by a lower enthalpy.
CONCLUSIONS: TfAM was successfully expressed in S. cerevisiae and was used to
make starches with new functionality.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first report on the expression 
of AM in the GRAS yeast and the production of a modified starch gel from pea
starch to improve the versatility of starch for food use.
