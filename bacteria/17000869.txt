Natural killer T cells (NKT cells) are selected in the thymus by self-glycolipid 
antigens presented by CD1d molecules. It is currently thought that one specific
component of the lysosomal processing pathway, which leads to the production of
isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3), is essential for normal NKT cell development. 
New evidence now shows that NKT cell development can be disrupted by a diverse
range of mutations that interfere with different elements of the lysosomal
processing and degradation of glycolipids. This suggests that lysosomal storage
diseases (LSDs) in general, rather than one specific defect, can disrupt CD1d
antigen presentation, leading to impaired development of NKT cells.
