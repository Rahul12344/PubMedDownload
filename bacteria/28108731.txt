The Endothelial cell specific molecule-1 (ESM1) protein has been involved in
proliferation and metastatic progression in multiple tumors. However, there are
no studies regarding the mechanism of ESM1 in prostate cancer. We found that ESM1
knockdown in prostate cancer cells resulted in increased cell proliferation and
colony formation ability response evidenced by decreased expression of p21 and
increased expression of cyclin D1 in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, we revealed
that knockdown ESM1 also induced the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
motility and invasiveness in accordance with the upregulated the MMP-9
expression, while downregulated the TIMP-1 expression. Recombinant human (Rh)
TIMP-1 significantly attenuated ESM1-mediated cell migration and invasion.
Additionally, ESM1 knockdown increased in vivo tumorigenicity and metastasis of
prostate cancer cells. These findings provide the first evidence that the
imbalance of MMP-9/TIMP-1, is one of the regulation mechanisms by which ESM1
promotes tumorigenicity and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.
