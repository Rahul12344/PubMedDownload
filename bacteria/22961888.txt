Who's first? Aldol cyclization occurs before hydrolysis in the resorcinol ring
formation catalyzed by the type III polyketide synthase, ArsB. Synthetic
C(20)-TKA was not converted to alkylresorcinol by ArsB, but rather inhibited the 
enzyme activity, thus indicating that C(20)-TKA is not an intermediate in
ArsB-catalyzed alkylresorcinol formation.
