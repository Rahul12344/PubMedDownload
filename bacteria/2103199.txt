67 patients with miliary TB diagnosed over a 15 year period (1973-1987) have been
retrospectively studied. The clinical and analysis data were evaluated,
highlighting different factors associated to higher mortality. 53 patients
diagnoses were made premortem and 14 had the diagnosis made post-mortem. The age 
of the patients was of 48 +/- 21 (mean +/- DE) years, inferior to other series,
this showing a higher prevalence and early age of infection in the area. 63% had 
miliary radiological features; the most frequent tests performed were liver
biopsy with profitability of 80% and bronchoscopy which, together with
transbronchial biopsy and bacterial analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage,
showed a positive diagnosis of 60%. The factors which were associated with bad
prognosis were cavitated or chronic lesions (P less than 0.01), chronic diseases 
and immunosuppression factors associated, this not being statistically
significant.
