A paradigm in transplantation states that graft-infiltrating T cells are largely 
non-alloreactive "bystander" cells. However, the origin and specificity of
allograft T cells over time has not been investigated in detail in animals or
humans. Here, we use polychromatic flow cytometry and high throughput TCR
sequencing of serial biopsies to show that gut-resident T cell turnover kinetics 
in human intestinal allografts are correlated with the balance between
intra-graft host-vs-graft (HvG) and graft-vs-host (GvH) reactivities and with
clinical outcomes. In the absence of rejection, donor T cells were enriched for
GvH-reactive clones that persisted long-term in the graft. Early expansion of GvH
clones in the graft correlated with rapid replacement of donor APCs by the
recipient. Rejection was associated with transient infiltration by blood-like
recipient CD28+ NKG2DHi CD8+ alpha beta T cells, marked predominance of HvG
clones, and accelerated T cell turnover in the graft. Ultimately, these recipient
T cells acquired a steady state tissue-resident phenotype, but regained CD28
expression during rejections. Increased ratios of GvH to HvG clones were seen in 
non-rejectors, potentially mitigating the constant threat of rejection posed by
HvG clones persisting within the tissue-resident graft T cell population.
