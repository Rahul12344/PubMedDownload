BACKGROUND: Cellular prion protein (PrP(C) ) is expressed on various cell types
including red blood cells (RBCs). The PrP(C) plays a key role in the pathogenesis
of prion diseases, but its physiologic function remains unclear. PrP(C) is
expressed on CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells and its expression is regulated
during blood cell differentiation including the erythroid line.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the role of PrP(C) in RBC survival in
circulation by transfusing a mix of biotin-labeled RBCs from wild-type (WT) and
PrP knockout (KO) mice to groups of recipient mice (WT and KO). The proportion of
biotinylated RBCs in peripheral blood was estimated by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: KO RBCs displayed a markedly higher first-day posttransfusion recovery
but had a decreased survival in circulation when compared to WT RBCs. Similar
results were obtained in all groups of transfused mice, irrespective of RBCs
biotinylation level. In addition, we confirmed this finding in an analogous study
using Tga20 mice overexpressing PrP(C) and KO mice of a different genetic
background.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that PrP(C) expression affects RBC recovery
and survival in circulation.
