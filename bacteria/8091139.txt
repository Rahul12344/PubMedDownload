The functional role of the chicken homologue of CD28 was studied. It is expressed
on all thymocytes, and both V beta 1- and V beta 2-family expressing peripheral
alpha beta T cells. Peripheral gamma delta T cells are CD28-negative. Monoclonal 
antibody against CD28 had a costimulatory effect on T cells stimulated by phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA), concanavalin A or MoAb against TCR. V beta 1 and V beta 
2 expressing cells responded equally well to stimulation with anti-CD28 in
combination with PMA. These responses were resistant to cyclosporin A, but
inhibited by herbimycin A, suggesting that CD28 employs a signalling pathway at
least partly distinct from that triggered by TCR/CD3. These data indicate a
striking conservation of the costimulatory function of CD28 and emphasize the
importance of this costimulatory pathway.
