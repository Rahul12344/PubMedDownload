To determine the effects of penicillin and erythromycin on cytokine production
induced by heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae (HKSP), we studied the effects of
those drugs on cytokine production induced by S. pneumoniae in human whole blood 
in vitro and ex vivo. In whole blood in vitro, erythromycin, but not penicillin, 
caused a dose-dependent decrease in HKSP-induced production of tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), while the production of IL-10,
IL-12, and gamma interferon was inhibited only at the highest erythromycin
concentration tested (10(-3) M). The production of TNF and IL-6 in whole blood
obtained from healthy subjects after a 30-min infusion of erythromycin (1,000 mg)
was lower after ex vivo stimulation with HKSP than that in blood drawn before the
infusion. Inhibition of TNF contributed to erythromycin-induced inhibition of
IL-6 synthesis. Inhibition of TNF and IL-6 production by erythromycin may have a 
negative impact on host defense mechanisms during pneumococcal pneumonia.
