The Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transfer of foreign DNA to the
phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea was investigated. Fifteen stable
transformants per 10(6) conidia were consistently produced. Monokaryons were
purified in a single step and their molecular analysis demonstrated the random
integration of predominantly single or tandem copies of the foreign DNA into
their genome. Thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR performed directly on conidia led
to the rapid identification of the genomic DNA sequences that flanked the
integration sites of the transfer-DNA. Transcriptional fusions of green
fluorescent protein and beta-glucuronidase-encoding genes to the promoter of the 
secreted proteolytic enzyme ACP1 were realised to validate the system. We provide
herein observations of B. cinerea hyphae producing green fluorescent protein or
beta-glucuronidase under growth conditions similar to those known to induce
transcription of the acp1 gene.
