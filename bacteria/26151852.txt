In anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Anammox) process, a harsh ratio of nitrite to
ammonia in influent was demanded, and the max nitrogen removal efficiency could
only achieve to 89%, both of which limited the development of Anammox. The aim of
this work was to study the nitrate removal by organotrophic anaerobic ammonium
oxidizing bacteria (AAOB) with C2/C3 fatty acid in upflow anaerobic sludge
blanket (UASB) reactors. In this study, organotrophic AAOB was successfully
enriched by adding acetate and propionate with the total organic carbon to
nitrogen (TOC/N) ratio of 0.1. In the condition of low substrate, the TN removal 
efficiency reached 90%, with the effluent TN of around 11.8 mg L(-1). After the
addition of acetate and propionate, the predominant species in Anammox granular
sludge transformed to Candidatus Jettenia that belonging to organotrophic AAOB
from the Candidatus Kuenenia relating to general AAOB.
