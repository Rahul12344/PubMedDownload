Disturbances in anaerobic digestion (AD) negatively impact the overall reactor
performance. These adverse effects have been widely investigated for methane
generation. However, AD recently appeared as a potential technology to obtain
volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and thus, the impact of process disturbances must be 
evaluated. In this sense, microbial response towards a starvation period of two
weeks was investigated resulting in a conversion of organic matter into VFAs of
0.39 ± 0.03 COD-VFAs/CODin. However, the lack of feeding reduced the yield to
0.30 ± 0.02 COD-VFAs/CODin. Microbial analysis revealed that the starvation
period favored the syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria coupled with
hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Finally, the system was fed at 9 g COD/Ld resulting
in process recovery (0.39 ± 0.04 COD-VFAs/CODin). The different microbiome
obtained at the end of the process was proved to be functionally redundant,
highlighting the AD robustness for VFAs production.
