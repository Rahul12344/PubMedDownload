Emergence and spread of resistance among vectors toward different insecticides is
a serious problem for the Japanese encephalitis (JE) control program. Regularly
monitoring the status of susceptibility of vector species to insecticides is
important for formulating proper vector control measures. In this study, we
studied the susceptibility status of major JE vectors from northern West Bengal, 
toward 4% DDT, 0.05% deltamethrin, and 5% malathion. Two- to three-day-old unfed 
female mosquitoes were subjected to a susceptibility bioassay using a World
Health Organization kit. Corrected mortality (CM) and knockdown times were
estimated. Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx.
gelidus were the major JE vectors present in the study areas. All 4 vector
species were highly tolerant to DDT with CM ＜ 90%. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, Cx.
vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. gelidus were tolerant to deltamethrin with CM
＜ 90%, except for Cx. gelidus of Darjeeling and Malbazar. At most of the study
sites, malathion was effective against Cx. vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx.
gelidus with CM ≥ 98%. In contrast, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus was tolerant to
malathion in all study areas. Predominant JE vector populations were highly
tolerant to all 3 analyzed insecticides, except deltamethrin for Cx. gelidus and 
malathion for Cx. vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. gelidus. The results of
this study may be useful for better planning and implementing a JE control
strategy.
