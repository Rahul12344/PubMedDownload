OBJECTIVES: To compare ion exchange and boronate affinity chromatography for
HbA(1c) estimation in patients with type I and II diabetes having hemoglobin D.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Systems based on ion exchange and boronate affinity
chromatography were evaluated and compared for their performance for HbA(1c)
estimation in patients with homozygous and heterozygous D disease.
RESULTS: Boronate affinity chromatography shows least interference by HbD in
heterozygous as well as homozygous diabetic patients for HbA(1c) estimation.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of boronate affinity chromatography was found to be helpful 
in evaluating glycemic control in diabetic subjects with HbD.
