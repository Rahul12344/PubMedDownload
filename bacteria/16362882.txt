BACKGROUND: Acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging pathogen in nosocomial
pneumonia. Trauma and postsurgical patients display a profound acute-phase
protein response and are susceptible to pneumonia.
METHODS: To study the way in which the acute-phase response induced by sterile
tissue injury influences pulmonary host defense, mice were injected
subcutaneously with turpentine or saline in both hind limbs either 2 or 5 days
before intranasal inoculation with A. baumannii.
RESULTS: Turpentine-injected mice demonstrated strong increases in levels of the 
acute-phase proteins serum amyloid A (SAA) and serum amyloid P. The inflammatory 
response to A. baumannii was significantly impaired in turpentine-injected mice, 
as shown by decreased local cytokine and chemokine levels, reduced neutrophil
influx and lung myeloperoxidase activity, less pulmonary inflammation on
histological examination, and lower total protein levels in their bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid, which was associated with reduced bacterial clearance of A.
baumannii. The late acute-phase protein response still caused lower pulmonary
cytokine levels and neutrophil recruitment. Furthermore, previous injection of
SAA, a major acute-phase protein, also reduced inflammatory responses to A.
baumannii pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the acute-phase response and SAA inhibit the
local inflammatory response to A. baumannii pneumonia, which may facilitate
bacterial outgrowth.
