Precise signaling by the T cell receptor (TCR) is crucial for a proper immune
response. To ensure that T cells respond appropriately to antigenic stimuli, TCR 
signaling pathways are subject to multiple levels of regulation. Sts-1 negatively
regulates signaling pathways downstream of the TCR by an unknown mechanism(s).
Here, we demonstrate that Sts-1 is a phosphatase that can target the tyrosine
kinase Zap-70 among other proteins. The X-ray structure of the Sts-1 C terminus
reveals that it has homology to members of the phosphoglycerate mutase/acid
phosphatase (PGM/AcP) family of enzymes, with residues known to be important for 
PGM/AcP catalytic activity conserved in nature and position in Sts-1. Point
mutations that impair Sts-1 phosphatase activity in vitro also impair the ability
of Sts-1 to regulate TCR signaling in T cells. These observations reveal a
PGM/AcP-like enzyme activity involved in the control of antigen receptor
signaling.
