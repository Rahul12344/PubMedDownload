Aberrant activation of EGFR represents a common event in non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) and activates various downstream signaling pathways. While EGFR
activation of β-catenin signaling was previously reported, the mediating
mechanism remains unclear. Our current study found that EGFR activation in NSCLC 
cells releases SHC-binging protein 1 (SHCBP1) from SHC adaptor protein 1 (SHC1), 
which subsequently translocates into the nucleus and directly promotes the
transactivating activity of β-catenin, consequently resulting in development of
NSCLC cell stemness and malignant progression. Furthermore, SHCBP1 promotes
β-catenin activity through enhancing the CBP/β-catenin interaction, and most
interestingly, a candidate drug that blocks the CBP/β-catenin binding effectively
abrogates the aforementioned biological effects of SHCBP1. Clinically, SHCBP1
level in NSCLC tumors was found to inversely correlate with patient survival.
Together, our study establishes a novel convergence between EGFR and β-catenin
pathways and highlights a potential significance of SHCBP1 as a prognostic
biomarker and a therapeutic target.
