Erythromycin has been shown to be beneficial for panbronchiolitis, a disorder
linked to infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Erythromycin, but not the
anti-Pseudomonas antibiotics imipenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin,
caused a dose-dependent decrease in the production of tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha by whole blood stimulated with heat-killed P. aeruginosa. The release
of interleukin (IL)-10, IL-6, interferon-gamma and IL-8 was inhibited only at the
highest erythromycin concentration. Inhibition of TNF-alpha production by
erythromycin may, at least in part, explain the efficacy of this macrolide during
panbronchiolitis despite its lack of activity for P. aeruginosa.
