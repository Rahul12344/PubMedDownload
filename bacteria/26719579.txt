T cells recognize cancer cells via HLA/peptide complexes, and when disease
overtakes these immune mechanisms, immunotherapy can exogenously target these
same HLA/peptide surface markers. We previously identified an HLA-A2-presented
peptide derived from macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and generated
antibody RL21A against this HLA-A2/MIF complex. The objective of the current
study was to assess the potential for targeting the HLA-A2/MIF complex in ovarian
cancer. First, MIF peptide FLSELTQQL was eluted from the HLA-A2 of the human
cancerous ovarian cell lines SKOV3, A2780, OV90, and FHIOSE118hi and detected by 
mass spectrometry. By flow cytometry, RL21A was shown to specifically stain these
four cell lines in the context of HLA-A2. Next, partially matched HLA-A*02:01+
ovarian cancer (n = 27) and normal fallopian tube (n = 24) tissues were stained
with RL21A by immunohistochemistry to assess differential HLA-A2/MIF complex
expression. Ovarian tumor tissues revealed significantly increased RL21A staining
compared with normal fallopian tube epithelium (P < 0.0001), with minimal
staining of normal stroma and blood vessels (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.001 compared
with tumor cells) suggesting a therapeutic window. We then demonstrated the
anticancer activity of toxin-bound RL21A via the dose-dependent killing of
ovarian cancer cells. In summary, MIF-derived peptide FLSELTQQL is
HLA-A2-presented and recognized by RL21A on ovarian cancer cell lines and patient
tumor tissues, and targeting of this HLA-A2/MIF complex with toxin-bound RL21A
can induce ovarian cancer cell death. These results suggest that the HLA-A2/MIF
complex should be further explored as a cell-surface target for ovarian cancer
immunotherapy.
