Methods are described for the characterization of CD34 antigen modulation and its
relationship to cell proliferation in early human hematopoietic cells. Toward
that end, quiescent primitive CD34+ and CD34NEG cells are purified from mobilized
peripheral blood (MoPB). Unlike CD34NEG cells from other sources, those from MoPB
grow readily in stroma-free culture, facilitating their analysis. Using a
lineage-depleted, low-density mononuclear cell fraction, CD34NEGCD38NEGLINNEG and
CD34+CD38NEGLINNEG cells are purified by cell sorting. Cells are cultured in
serum-free medium supplemented with early acting cytokines. Up- and
downmodulation of CD34 antigen can be observed within 40 h of incubation. Samples
are removed for analysis of expression of CD34, CD38 and lineage-commitment
antigens as well as for cell proliferation as determined by expression of Ki67
antigen and uptake of pyronin Y. This approach permits an assessment of changes
in CD34 and CD38 antigen expression by primitive LINNEG cells as they are
activated for growth or remain in a quiescent state.
