In May, 2017, an outbreak of rotavirus gastroenteritis was reported that
predominantly impacted Aboriginal children â‰¤4 years of age in the Kimberley
region of Western Australia. G2P[4] was identified as the dominant genotype
circulating during this period and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed
the majority of samples exhibited a conserved electropherotype. Full genome
sequencing was performed on representative samples that exhibited the archetypal 
DS-1-like genome constellation: G2-P[4]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2 and
phylogenetic analysis revealed all genes of the outbreak samples were closely
related to contemporary Japanese G2P[4] samples. The outbreak samples
consistently fell within conserved sub-clades comprised of Hungarian and
Australian G2P[4] samples from 2010. The 2017 outbreak variant was not closely
related to G2P[4] variants associated with prior outbreaks in Aboriginal
communities in the Northern Territory. When compared to the G2 component of the
RotaTeq vaccine, the outbreak variant exhibited mutations in known antigenic
regions; however, these mutations are frequently observed in contemporary G2P[4] 
strains. Despite the level of vaccine coverage achieved in Australia, outbreaks
continue to occur in vaccinated populations, which pose challenges to regional
areas and remote communities. Continued surveillance and characterisation of
emerging variants are imperative to ensure the ongoing success of the rotavirus
vaccination program in Australia.
