Thaxtomin A is a phytotoxin produced by Streptomyces scabies and other
Streptomyces species, the causative agents of common scab disease in potato and
other taproot crops. At nanomolar concentrations, thaxtomin causes dramatic cell 
swelling, reduced seedling growth, and inhibition of cellulose synthesis in
Arabidopsis. We identified a mutant of Arabidopsis, designated txr1, that
exhibits increased resistance to thaxtomin as a result of a decrease in the rate 
of toxin uptake. The TXR1 gene was identified by map-based cloning and found to
encode a novel, small protein with no apparent motifs or organelle-targeting
signals. The protein, which has homologs in all fully sequenced eukaryotic
genomes, is expressed in all tissues and during all developmental stages
analyzed. Microarray transcript profiling of some 14,300 genes revealed two
stomatin-like genes that were expressed differentially in the txr1 mutant and the
wild type. We propose that TXR1 is a regulator of a transport mechanism.
