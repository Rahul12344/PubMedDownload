The role of the unique T-cell population, natural killer T (NKT) cells, which
have similar functions to NK cells in pancreatic cancer (PC), is not yet
evaluated. To address the regulatory roles of NKT cells on tumour progression
through tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) and their production of microsomal
prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) in (Kras)-driven 
pancreatic tumour (KPT) progression, we crossed CD1d-/- mice deficient in both
invariant and variant NKT cells with the KrasG12D mice. Loss of NKT cells
significantly increased pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions and 
also increased 5-LOX and mPGES-1 expression in M2-type macrophages and cancer
stem-like cells in pancreatic tumours. Pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 and 
5-LOX in M2 macrophages with specific inhibitor YS-121 in KPT-CD1d-/- mice
decreased PanIN lesions and suppressed tumour growth in association with elevated
levels of active CD8a cells. Hence, NKT cells regulate PC by modulating TAMs (M2)
through mPGES-1 and 5-LOX; and the absence of NKT cells leads to aggressive
development of PC.
