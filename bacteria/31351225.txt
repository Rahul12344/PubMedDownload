Microorganisms in animal gut produce unusual fatty acids from the ingested diet. 
Two types of hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs), 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid
(HYA) and 10-hydroxy-octadecanoic acid (HYB), are linoleic acid (LA) metabolites 
produced by Lactobacillus plantarum. In this study, we investigated the
metabolism of these HFAs in mammalian cells. When Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)
cells were cultured with HYA, approximately 50% of the supplemented HYA
disappeared from the dish within 24 h. On the other hand, the amount of HYA that 
disappeared from the dish of peroxisome (PEX)-deficient CHO cells was lower than 
20%. Significant amounts of C2- and C4-chain-shortened metabolites of HYA were
detected in culture medium of HYA-supplemented CHO cells, but not in medium of
PEX-deficient cells. These results suggested that peroxisomal β-oxidation is
involved in the disappearance of HYA. The PEX-dependent disappearance was
observed in the experiment with HYB, but not with LA. We also found that HYA
treatment up-regulates peroxisomal β-oxidation activity of human gastric MKN74
cells and intestinal Caco-2 cells. These results indicate a possibility that HFAs
produced from gut bacteria affect lipid metabolism of host via modulation of
peroxisomal β-oxidation activity.
