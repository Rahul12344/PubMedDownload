Pseudouridine synthase 1 (Pus1p) is an unusual site-specific modification enzyme 
in that it can modify a number of positions in tRNAs and can recognize several
other types of RNA. No consensus recognition sequence or structure has been
identified for Pus1p. Human Pus1p was used to determine which structural or
sequence elements of human tRNA(Ser) are necessary for pseudouridine (Ψ)
formation at position 28 in the anticodon stem-loop (ASL). Some point mutations
in the ASL stem of tRNA(Ser) had significant effects on the levels of
modification and compensatory mutation, to reform the base pair, restored a
wild-type level of Ψ formation. Deletion analysis showed that the tRNA(Ser) TΨC
stem-loop was a determinant for modification in the ASL. A mini-substrate
composed of the ASL and TΨC stem-loop exhibited significant Ψ formation at
position 28 and a number of mutants were tested. Substantial base pairing in the 
ASL stem (3 out of 5 bp) is required, but the sequence of the TΨC loop is not
required for modification. When all nucleotides in the ASL stem other than U28
were changed in a single mutant, but base pairing was retained, a near wild-type 
level of modification was observed.
