Paneth cells secrete bactericidal substances in response to bacterial
proliferation on the mucosal surface without directly contacting bacteria.
However, the induction mechanism of this transient secretion has not been
clarified, although nervous system and/or immunocompetent cells in the lamina
propria (LP) might be involved. In this study, we ultrastructurally and
immunohistochemically investigated which LP cells are localized beneath Paneth
cells and examined the relationship between the Paneth cell-derived cellular
processes which extended into the LP and the LP cells. The results showed that
various cells-including blood capillary, subepithelial stromal cell, and nerve
fiber-were present in the LP beneath Paneth cells. Endothelial cells of blood
capillary were the cells most frequently found in this location; they were
situated within 1 μm of the Paneth cells and possessed fenestration on the
surfaces adjacent to Paneth cells. The Paneth cells rarely extended the cellular 
processes toward the LP across the basal lamina. Most of the cellular processes
of Paneth cells contacted the subepithelial stromal cells. Immunohistochemistry
revealed that the CD34+ CD31- αSMA- stromal cells preferentially localized in the
LP beneath the intestinal crypt base, while PDGFRαhi αSMA+ stromal cells mainly
localized around the lateral portions of the intestinal crypt and PDGFRαhi αSMA- 
stromal cells localized in the intestinal villus. From these findings, the
existence of blood capillaries beneath Paneth cells might reflect the active
exocrine function of Paneth cells. Furthermore, subepithelial stromal cells,
probably with a CD34+ CD31- αSMA- PDGFRα-/lo phenotype, beneath the crypt base
might affect Paneth cell activity by interacting with their cellular processes.
