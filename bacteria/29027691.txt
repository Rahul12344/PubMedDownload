Adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity, through adenosine (Ado) levels, as well as
xanthine oxidase (XO) activity through uric acid levels exerts an essential role 
on immune and inflammatory responses during infectious diseases. Thus, the aim of
this study was to evaluate the involvement of seric ADA and XO activities in the 
inflammatory and oxidative status of silver catfish naturally infected with
Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. Seric ADA activity decreased, while Ado levels
increased in infected animals compared to uninfected animals. Moreover, the seric
XO activity increased in infected animals compared to uninfected animals,
alongside the seric levels of uric acid, metabolites of nitric oxide (NOx) and
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on this evidence, the downregulation of
seric ADA activity exerts an anti-inflammatory profile, contributing to
restricting the inflammatory process. The most important finding is that
upregulation of seric XO activity leads to an excessive formation of uric acid,
which contributes to oxidative and inflammatory processes. Moreover, uric acid
induces the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative mediators, such NOx and
ROS, which contribute directly to disease pathogenesis. In summary, the
upregulation of XO activity may be considered a pathway involved in NOx and ROS
production in silver catfish infected with I. multifiliis.
