The genus Bifidobacterium is well known to have beneficial health effects. We
discovered that quercetin and related polyphenols enhanced the secretion of
anti-inflammatory substances by Bifidobacterium adolescentis. This study
investigated characteristics of the anti-inflammatory substances secreted by B.
adolescentis. The culture supernatant of B. adolescentis with quercetin reduced
the levels of inflammatory mediators in activated macrophages. Spontaneous
quercetin degradant failed to increase anti-inflammatory activity, while the
enhancement of anti-inflammatory activity by quercetin was sustained after
washout of quercetin. Physicochemical treatment of the culture supernatant
indicated that its bioactive substances may be heat-stable, non-phenolic, and
acidic biomolecules with molecular weights less than 3Â kDa. Acetate and lactate
have little or no effect on nitric oxide production. Taken together, the
anti-inflammatory substances secreted by B. adolescentis may be small molecules
but not short chain fatty acids. In agreement with these findings, stearic acid
was tentatively identified as a bioactive candidate compound.
