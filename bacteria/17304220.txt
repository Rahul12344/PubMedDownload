Fanconi anemia (FA) is a chromosome fragility syndrome characterized by bone
marrow failure and cancer susceptibility. The central FA protein FANCD2 is known 
to relocate to chromatin upon DNA damage in a poorly understood process. Here, we
have induced subnuclear accumulation of DNA damage to prove that histone H2AX is 
a novel component of the FA/BRCA pathway in response to stalled replication
forks. Analyses of cells from H2AX knockout mice or expressing a
nonphosphorylable H2AX (H2AX(S136A/S139A)) indicate that phosphorylated H2AX
(gammaH2AX) is required for recruiting FANCD2 to chromatin at stalled replication
forks. FANCD2 binding to gammaH2AX is BRCA1-dependent and cells deficient or
depleted of H2AX show an FA-like phenotype, including an excess of chromatid-type
chromosomal aberrations and hypersensitivity to MMC. This MMC hypersensitivity of
H2AX-deficient cells is not further increased by depleting FANCD2, indicating
that H2AX and FANCD2 function in the same pathway in response to DNA
damage-induced replication blockage. Consequently, histone H2AX is functionally
connected to the FA/BRCA pathway to resolve stalled replication forks and prevent
chromosome instability.
