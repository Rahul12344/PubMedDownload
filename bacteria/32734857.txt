We report a case of Legionella pneumonia in a dishwasher of a restaurant in Rome,
Italy, just after the end of the lockdown that was in place to control the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. The case highlights the importance of strict monitoring of
water and air systems immediately before reopening business or public sector
buildings, and the need to consider Legionella infections among the differential 
diagnosis of respiratory infections after lockdown due to the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.
