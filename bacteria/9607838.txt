Enteric infections induce a response of circulating pathogen-specific
antibody-secreting cells (ASC). The expression of homing receptors (HRs) on these
cells was studied in patients with diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae in
Bangladesh, an area in which cholera is endemic. The gut HR, alpha4beta7, was
expressed by approximately 80% of the ASC, indicating mucosal homing of these
cells. However, the peripheral lymph node HR, L-selectin, was also expressed by
approximately 80% of the ASC specific to either cholera toxin or O antigen. In
earlier findings after oral immunization in nonendemic areas, alpha4beta7 has
been expressed by approximately 100% and L-selectin by approximately 50% of the
ASC. In comparison, the present data speak for a more systemic targeting of the
immune response associated with long-lasting immunity in an endemic area. The
results thus provide insight for the continued development and evaluation of
vaccines.
