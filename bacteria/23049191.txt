According to Sushruta, disease in which plaque formed on teeth and hardened by
the action of deranged Vayu, lies in a crystallized form at root of teeth is
called as Dantasharkara. According to Vagbhata, accumulation of dirt on teeth by 
not cleaning them daily or of Kapha dehydrated by Vata adhering to the teeth,
becoming hard and emits bad odor is known as Dantasharkara (Tartar). Tartar
manifests as a deposit of inorganic salts composed primarily of calcium carbonate
and phosphate mixed with food debris, bacteria and desquamated epithelial cells
which reduce the quality of whiteness and strength of the teeth. Teeth loss is
also not uncommon in tartar sufferers. Such deposits tend to destroy the healthy 
growth and function of teeth. It should be removed in such a way as not to hurt
the roots of the teeth and then parts should be rubbed (Pratisarana) with Laksha 
Churna and Madhu. In trial group, management of tartar is attempted by local
rubbing of Laksha Churna with Madhu on the surface of teeth and gingiva.
Regeneration, repair and new attachment are the aspects of periodontal healing
that are achieved by gingival physiotherapy on scaling wound. Pratisarana of
Laksha Churna with Madhu is easy to apply, cost effective and free from side
effects in comparison to systemic use of modern drugs.
