Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) express
superantigen (SAg) exotoxin proteins capable of inducing lethal shock. To induce 
toxicity, SAgs must bind not only to the major histocompatibility complex II
molecule of antigen-presenting cells and the variable Î² chain of the T-cell
receptor but also to the dimer interface of the T-cell costimulatory receptor
CD28. Here, we show that the CD28-mimetic peptide AB103 (originally designated
"p2TA") protects mice from lethal challenge with streptococcal exotoxin A, as
well as from lethal GAS bacterial infection in a murine model of necrotizing
soft-tissue infection. Administration of a single dose of AB103 increased
survival when given up to 5 hours after infection, reduced inflammatory cytokine 
expression and bacterial burden at the site of infection, and improved muscle
inflammation in a dose-dependent manner, without compromising cellular and
humoral immunity. Thus, AB103 merits further investigation as a potential
therapeutic in SAg-mediated necrotizing soft-tissue infection.
