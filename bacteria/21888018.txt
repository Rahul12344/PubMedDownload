BACKGROUND: Cyclosporin A (CsA) is an immunosuppressant with side effects
including gingival hyperplasia. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease characterized
by granulomas. Here, we report on a rare case of sarcoidosis with gingival
hyperplasia to clarify whether clinical observation corresponds to in vitro
results.
METHODS: Gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) were isolated from healthy gingiva and
cultured with CsA. Total RNA was collected and expression of mRNAs examined using
semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Cathepsin B, D, and L expression in overgrown 
gingiva of the patient was examined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Cathepsin D, L, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 mRNA
were markedly suppressed in CsA-treated HGFs, whereas cathepsin B, matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) 
mRNA were not reduced. Next, the decrease of cathepsin B and L expression in
enlarged gingiva was observed, whereas an increase of cathepsin D expression was 
observed. Clinically, the enlarged gingival lesions were fully resolved by
performing oral infection control.
CONCLUSIONS: Cathepsins regulation might be an important factor in the
development of CsA-mediated gingival hyperplasia.
