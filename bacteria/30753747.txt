We studied cytokine profiles in BAL of LTRs with Aspergillus spp colonization who
did not progress to IPA in the absence of antifungal prophylaxis. This was a
retrospective, single center case-control study. BAL samples were analyzed for
cytokines. Patients with Aspergillus spp in BAL who did not receive prophylaxis
and did not develop IPA were compared to LTRs with Aspergillus spp that received 
prophylaxis, LTRs with IPA and controls. Twenty-one patients with Aspergillus
colonization who did not develop IPA, seven patients with suspected IPA who
received prophylaxis, 4 IPA and 19 controls were included. IPA group had
significantly higher levels (median [IQR]) of MIP-1 beta compared to the
Suspected IPA group (5 vs 5 P: 0.03). The Suspected IPA group had significantly
higher levels of IL-12 (11.38 vs 1 P: 0.0001), IL-1 RA (86.11 vs 23.98 P:
0.0118), IP-10 (22.47 vs 0.86 P: 0.0151), HGF (40.92 vs 16.82 P: 0.0055), and MIG
(169.62 vs 5 P: 0.0005) than Colonization group. We have identified a unique
cytokine signature in patients with Aspergillus colonization that do not develop 
IPA. Our study forms basis for a larger study to use these cytokines profile to
identify patients at a lower risk of developing IPA.
