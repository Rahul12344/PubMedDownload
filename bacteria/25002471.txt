Clinical-grade T cells are genetically modified ex vivo to express chimeric
antigen receptors (CARs) to redirect their specificity to target tumor-associated
antigens in vivo. We now have developed this molecular strategy to render
cytotoxic T cells specific for fungi. We adapted the pattern-recognition receptor
Dectin-1 to activate T cells via chimeric CD28 and CD3-ζ (designated "D-CAR")
upon binding with carbohydrate in the cell wall of Aspergillus germlings. T cells
genetically modified with the Sleeping Beauty system to express D-CAR stably were
propagated selectively on artificial activating and propagating cells using an
approach similar to that approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
manufacturing CD19-specific CAR(+) T cells for clinical trials. The D-CAR(+) T
cells exhibited specificity for β-glucan which led to damage and inhibition of
hyphal growth of Aspergillus in vitro and in vivo. Treatment of D-CAR(+) T cells 
with steroids did not compromise antifungal activity significantly. These data
support the targeting of carbohydrate antigens by CAR(+) T cells and provide a
clinically appealing strategy to enhance immunity for opportunistic fungal
infections using T-cell gene therapy.
