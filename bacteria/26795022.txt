The complete nucleotide sequences of three multidrug resistance (MDR) IncA/C-like
plasmids from Enterobacteriaceae isolates carrying the VIM-type
carbapenemase-encoding integrons In4863 (blaVIM-19-aacA7-dfrA1-ΔaadA1-smr2) or
In4873 (blaVIM-1-aacA7-dfrA1-ΔaadA1-smr2) were determined, which are the first
In416-like elements identified in Greece. Plasmids pKP-Gr642 and pKP-Gr8143 were 
from Klebsiella pneumoniae ST383 isolates, whereas plasmid pEcl-Gr4873 was from
an Enterobacter cloacae ST88 isolate. Sequencing showed that pKP-Gr642 (162787bp)
and pKP-Gr8143 (154395bp) consisted of the type 1 IncA/C2 conserved backbone, the
blaCMY-2-like gene-containing region, and the ARI-B (with the sul2 gene) and
ARI-A (with a class 1 integron) resistance islands, like the plasmid pUMNK88_161 
from the USA. The third plasmid, pEcl-Gr4873 (153958bp), exhibited extensive
similarity with the type 2 IncA/C2 plasmid pR55 from France. pEcl-Gr4873 carried 
only one resistance island of a hybrid transposon structure inserted in a
different location to ARI-A in type 1 A/C2 plasmids. In all three plasmids, the
In416-like integrons In4863 or In4873 were identified within non-identical class 
II transposon structures. All three In416-like-carrying regions presented
significant similarities with the MDR region of the IncA/C2 plasmid pCC416 from
Italy, carrying the prototype In416 integron (blaVIM-4-aacA7-dfrA1-ΔaadA1-smr2). 
These findings provided the basis for speculations regarding the evolution of
IncA/C2 plasmids with In416-like integrons, and confirmed the rapid evolution of 
some IncA/C2 plasmid lineages. Considering the broad host range of IncA/C2
molecules, it seems that pKP-Gr642, pKP-Gr8143 and pEcl-Gr4873 plasmids might
support the diffusion of In416-like integrons among Enterobacteriaceae.
