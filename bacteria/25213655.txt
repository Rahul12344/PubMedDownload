Few studies have been conducted to explore the community composition in
denitrifying biocathode. Herein, the microbial communities of denitrifying
biocathodes yielding current of 1 mA (reactor C1) and 1.5 mA (reactor C2) were
characterized by 454 pyrosequencing. The nitrate removal efficiencies in C1 and
C2 were about 93 and 85%, respectively. The optimization of data generated
high-quality sequences of 18509 in C1 and 14857 in C2. Proteobacteria was the
predominant phylum, and Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes were the
subdominant groups. Classes of Alphaproteobacteria, Anaerolineae, and
Phycisphaerae may benefit the performance of current production and nitrate
removal. Twenty-nine dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) accounted for 64
and 65% of sequences in C1 and C2, respectively. A denitrifying pathway was
constructed based on the phylogenetic analysis and function inferring of the
dominant OTUs. Obviously, the 454 pyrosequencing provided a high-resolution
profile of bacteria community in denitrifying biocathode.
