The insertion of central venous catheters (CVC) represent a very common procedure
in intensive care units. The purpose of this study was to determine the via that 
provide the best chance for a good location of the tip of a CVC. The 563 CVCs
that were inserted percutaneously and that had a radiology control were analyzed.
The infraclavicular via was used for 303 (25%) CVCs; the jugular via had 142
(25%) CVCs and the supraclavicular via was used in 118 (21%) CVCs. The rate of
bad location of the tip of the CVC were 17%, 6% and 9%, respectively. There was a
significant difference when the insertion through infraclavicular via and jugular
via were compared. There were 9 pneumothorax (1.4%). 127 CVCs were sent to
microbiology laboratory, 26 (20%) had positive culture (> 15 colony forming
units). The most frequent agents isolates were: Candida spp (7), S. aureus (5),
S. epidermidis (4) and P. aeruginosa (3).
