Mutations of the reelin gene cause severe defects in cerebral cortex development 
and profound intellectual impairment. While many aspects of the reelin signaling 
pathway have been identified, the molecular and ultimate cellular consequences of
reelin signaling remain unknown. Specifically, it is unclear if termination of
reelin signaling is as important for normal cortical neuron migration as
activation of reelin signaling. Using mice that are single or double deficient,
we discovered that combined loss of the suppressors of cytokine signaling, SOCS6 
and SOCS7, recapitulated the cortical layer inversion seen in mice lacking reelin
and led to a dramatic increase in the reelin signaling molecule disabled (DAB1)
in the cortex. The SRC homology domains of SOCS6 and SOCS7 bound DAB1 ex vivo.
Mutation of DAB1 greatly diminished binding and protected from degradation by
SOCS6. Phosphorylated DAB1 was elevated in cortical neurons in the absence of
SOCS6 and SOCS7. Thus, constitutive activation of reelin signaling was observed
to be equally detrimental as lack of activation. We hypothesize that, by
terminating reelin signaling, SOCS6 and SOCS7 may allow new cycles of reelin
signaling to occur and that these may be essential for cortical neuron migration.
