Calcineurin inhibitor Tacrolimus, is a potent immunosuppressive drug widely used 
in order to prevent acute graft rejection. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the
most frequent infectious complication in renal transplant patients and long-term 
use of Tacrolimus might be involved in higher susceptibility to bacterial
infections. It remains largely unknown how Tacrolimus affects the host innate
immune response against lower and upper UTI. To address this issue, we used
experimental UTI model by intravesical inoculation of uropathogenic E.coli in
female wild-type mice pre-treated with Tacrolimus or solvent (CTR). We found that
Tacrolimus pre-treated mice displayed higher bacterial loads (cystitis,
pyelonephritis and bacteremia) than CTR mice. Granulocytes from Tacrolimus
pre-treated mice phagocytized less E. coli, released less MPO and expressed
decreased levels of CXCR2 receptor upon infection. Moreover, Tacrolimus reduced
TLR5 expression in bladder macrophages during UTI. This immunosuppressive state
can be explained by the upregulation of TLR-signaling negative regulators (A20,
ATF3, IRAK-M and SOCS1) and parallel downregulation of TLR5 as observed in
Tacrolimus treated granulocytes and macrophages. We conclude that Tacrolimus
impairs host innate immune responses against UTI.
