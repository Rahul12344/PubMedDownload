Little is known about the impact of different microbial signals on skin barrier
organ function and the interdependency between resident microflora and pathogenic
microorganisms. This study shows that commensal and pathogenic staphylococci
differ in their ability to induce expression of antimicrobial peptides/proteins
(AMPs) and activate different signaling pathways in human primary keratinocytes. 
Whereas secreted factors of skin commensals induce expression of the AMPs HBD-3
and RNase7 in primary human keratinocytes via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, EGFR,
and NF-κB activation, those of pathogenic staphylococci activate the
mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling 
pathways and suppress NF-κB activation. Interestingly, commensal bacteria are
able to amplify the innate immune response of human keratinocytes to pathogens by
increased induction of AMP expression and abrogation of NF-κB suppression,
suggesting that the two activation pathways can act in a synergistic way. These
data indicate that commensal and pathogenic microorganisms evolved specific
mechanisms to modulate innate immunity of the skin.
