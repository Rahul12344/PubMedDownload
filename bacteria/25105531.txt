NOx, a significant portion of fossil fuel flue gases, are among the most serious 
environmental issues in the world and must be removed in an additional costly gas
treatment step. This study evaluated the growth of the green alga Chlorella sp.
C2 under a nitrite-simulated NOx environment and the removal rates of actual flue
gas fixed salts (FGFSs) from Sinopec's Shijiazhuang refinery along with lipid
production. The results showed that nitrite levels lower than 176.5 mM had no
significant adverse effects on the cell growth and photosynthesis of Chlorella
sp. C2, demonstrating that this green alga could utilize nitrite and NOx as a
nitrogen source. High concentrations of nitrite (88.25-176.5 mM) also resulted in
the accumulation of neutral lipids. A 60% nitrite removal efficiency was obtained
together with the production of 33% algae lipids when cultured with FGFS.
Notably, the presence of nitrate in the FGFS medium significantly enhanced the
nitrite removal capability, biomass and lipid production. Thus, this study may
provide a new insight into the economically viable application of microalgae in
the synergistic combination of biological DeNOx of industrial flue gases and
biodiesel production.
