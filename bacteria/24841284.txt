Several serious gastrointestinal diseases, which are widespread all over the
world, are caused by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. The monomeric
autotransporter AIDA-I (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence) represents an
important virulence factor of these strains and is involved in adhesion, biofilm 
formation, aggregation and invasion into host cells. Here, we present the crystal
structure of the transport unit of AIDA-I at 3.0Å resolution, which forms a
12-stranded β-barrel harboring the linker domain in its pore. Mutagenesis studies
of the C-terminal amino acid demonstrated the great impact of this terminal
residue on membrane integration of AIDA-I and passenger translocation.
