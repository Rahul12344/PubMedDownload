BACKGROUND: Phosphohistidine phosphatase 1 (PHPT1), also named protein histidine 
phosphatase (PHP), is a eukaryotic enzyme dephosphorylating proteins and peptides
that are phosphorylated on a histidine residue. A preliminary finding that
histone H1, which lacks histidine, was phosphorylated by phosphoramidate and
dephosphorylated by PHPT1 prompted the present investigation.
METHODS: Histone H1 and polylysine were phosphorylated at a low concentration
(3.9 mM) of phosphoramidate. Their dephosphorylation by recombinant human PHPT1
was investigated by using a DEAE-Sepharose spin column technique earlier
developed by us for studies on basic phosphoproteins and phosphopeptides.
Determination of protein-bound, acid-labile phosphate was performed by a
malachite green method. Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to investigate the
occurrence of N-ε-phospholysine residues in a phosphorylated histone H1.2
preparation, and to measure the activity of PHPT1 against free
N-ω-phosphoarginine.
RESULTS: Histone H1.2, which lacks histidine, was phosphorylated by
phosphoramidate on several lysine residues, as shown by MS. PHPT1 was shown to
dephosphorylate phosphohistone H1 at a rate similar to that previously described 
for the dephosphorylation of phosphohistidine-containing peptides. In addition,
phosphopolylysine was an equally good substrate for PHPT1. However, no
dephosphorylation of free phosphoarginine by PHPT1 could be detected.
CONCLUSION: The finding that PHPT1 can dephosphorylate phospholysine in
chemically phosphorylated histone H1 and polylysine demonstrates a broader
specificity for this enzyme than known so far.
