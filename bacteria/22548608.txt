AIMS:   To evaluate the antagonistic effect of Pseudomonas M162 against
Flavobacterium psychrophilum.
METHODS AND RESULTS:   The antagonistic activity of M162 was tested in vivo and
in vitro, and its mode of action examined by siderophore production and
immunological responses of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry. Pseudomonas
M162 inhibited the growth of Fl. psychrophilum in vitro and increased the
resistance of the fish against the pathogen, resulting in a relative per cent
survival (RPS) of 39·2%. However, the siderophores produced by M162 did not have 
an inhibitory effect on Fl. psychrophilum. In fish fed with M162, the probiotic
colonized the gastrointestinal tract and stimulated peripheral blood leucocyte
counts, serum lysozyme activity and total serum immunoglobulin levels after
3 weeks from the start of feeding.
CONCLUSIONS:   This study showed the potential of Pseudomonas M162 as a probiotic
by reducing the mortalities that occurred during an experimental Fl.
psychrophilum infection, resulting mainly through the immunostimulatory effects
of the bacterium.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:   Rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS) causes 
high mortalities during the early life stages of the fish's life cycle, partly
because their adaptive immunity has not yet fully developed. Thus,
immunomodulation by probiotics could be an effective prophylactic method against 
RTFS.
