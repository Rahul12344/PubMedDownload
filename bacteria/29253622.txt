BACKGROUND: Given the importance of monitoring healthcare-associated infections
(HCAIs) and the consumption of antibiotics, a regional point prevalence survey
was conducted in Liguria between March and April 2016.
AIM: To measure the overall prevalence of HCAI and describe the use of
antibiotics in all public hospitals.
METHODS: Data on risk factors and use of antibiotics were collected for each
hospitalized patient. To define the variables significantly associated with HCAI,
univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Standardized infection ratio
and standardized antimicrobial use ratio were measured for each participating
hospital.
FINDINGS: A total of 3647 patients were enrolled. In all, 429 HCAIs were
diagnosed in 376 patients, giving a prevalence of HCAI of 10.3%. Respiratory
tract (21.7%) and urinary tract (20%) were the most frequent sites of infection. 
High rates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (47.4%) and
Enterobacteriaceae resistant to carbapenems (26.3%) were isolated. Forty-six
percent of patients received at least one antibiotic. Combinations of penicillins
including β-lactamase inhibitors (24.1%) were the most widely used; the main
indication (46.7%) was the treatment of a community-acquired infection.
CONCLUSION: There was an increase in HCAI prevalence compared to a similar survey
conducted in 2007; however, the performance of overlapping investigations will
enable more reliable considerations. Nevertheless, data on antimicrobial
resistance and use of antibiotics are consistent with the national trend. Despite
methodological limitations, prevalence studies are useful to monitor HCAI over
time and encourage greater awareness of the problem by all stakeholders.
