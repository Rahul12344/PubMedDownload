BACKGROUND: Plasmodium ovale, considered the rarest of the malaria parasites of
humans, consists of two morphologically identical but genetically distinct
sympatric species, Plasmodium ovale curtisi and Plasmodium ovale wallikeri. These
parasites resemble morphologically to Plasmodium vivax with which they also share
a tertian periodicity and the ability to cause relapses, making them easily
misidentified as P. vivax. Plasmodium ovale infections are rarely reported, but
given the likelihood of misidentification, their prevalence might be
underestimated.
METHODS: Morphological and molecular analysis of confirmed malaria cases admitted
in Singapore in 2012-2014 detected nine imported P. ovale cases that had been
misidentified as P. vivax. Since P. ovale had not been previously officially
reported in Singapore, a retrospective analysis of available, frozen, archival
blood samples was performed and returned two additional misidentified P. ovale
cases in 2003 and 2006. These eleven P. ovale samples were characterized with
respect to seven molecular markers (ssrRNA, Potra, Porbp2, Pog3p, dhfr-ts, cytb, 
cox1) used in recent studies to distinguish between the two sympatric species,
and to a further three genes (tufa, clpC and asl).
RESULTS: The morphological features of P. ovale and the differential diagnosis
with P. vivax were reviewed and illustrated by microphotographs. The genetic
dimorphism between P. ovale curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri was assessed by ten
molecular markers distributed across the three genomes of the parasite (Genbank
KP050361-KP050470). The data obtained for seven of these markers were compared
with those published and confirmed that both P. ovale species were present. This 
dimorphism was also confirmed for the first time on: (1) two genes from the
apicoplast genome (tufA and clpC genes); and, (2) the asl gene that was used for 
phylogenetic analyses of other Plasmodium species, and that was found to harbour 
the highest number of dimorphic loci between the two P. ovale species.
CONCLUSION: Misidentified P. ovale infections are reported for the first time
among imported malaria cases in Singapore. Genetic dimorphism between P. ovale
curtisi and P. ovale wallikeri was confirmed using markers from the parasites'
three genomes. The apparent increase of imported P. ovale since 2012 (with yearly
detection of cases) is puzzling. Given decrease in the overall number of malaria 
cases recorded in Singapore since 2010 the 'resurgence' of this neglected species
raises public health concerns.
