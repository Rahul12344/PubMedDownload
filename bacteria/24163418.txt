Leptospirosis is an infectious disease of public health importance. To
successfully colonize the host, pathogens have evolved multiple strategies to
escape the complement system. Here we demonstrate that the culture supernatant of
pathogenic but not saprophytic Leptospira inhibit the three complement pathways. 
We showed that the proteolytic activity in the supernatants of pathogenic strains
targets the central complement molecule C3 and specific proteins from each
pathway, such as factor B, C2, and C4b. The proteases cleaved α and β chains of
C3 and work in synergy with host regulators to inactivate C3b. Proteolytic
activity was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting the participation of
metalloproteases. A recombinant leptospiral metalloprotease from the thermolysin 
family cleaved C3 in serum and could be one of the proteases responsible for the 
supernatant activity. We conclude that pathogenic leptospiral proteases can
deactivate immune effector molecules and represent potential targets to the
development of new therapies in leptospirosis.
