BACKGROUND: Rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV are highest
in the southern United States but vary widely by sex, age, and risk behavior.
Current guidelines recommend annual screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis,
and trichomoniasis in all sexually active women with HIV.
METHODS: Screening rates and test positivity for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, 
and trichomoniasis were determined per calendar year in this retrospective cohort
study of women in care at an urban HIV clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, from 2013
to 2015. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomonas infections were detected by
molecular diagnostics and syphilis by serology. A combined end point for
chlamydia/gonorrhea/syphilis (STI-3) was created based on similar test positivity
and predictors. Predictors of STI-3 were identified using logistic regression and
generalized estimating equations.
RESULTS: Among 745 women with HIV, median age was 46.8 years, 78.8% were black,
and 61% were sexually active. In 2015, 83.7% of women were tested for STI. Test
positivity was 1.0% for chlamydia, 0.5% for gonorrhea, 1.6% for syphilis, and
13.3% for trichomoniasis. Independent predictors of STI-3 were recent chlamydia
or gonorrhea (odds ratio [OR], 3.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1-13.4; P =
0.047), public insurance compared with private (OR, 3.5; CI, 1-11.8; P = 0.048), 
and sex after drugs/alcohol (OR, 3.0; CI, 1.2-8.0; P = 0.025). Women 50 years or 
older were less likely to have STI (OR, 0.3; CI, 0.1-1; P = 0.040).
CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of women engaged in HIV care in the southern United
States, detection of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis was infrequent but
trichomoniasis was common. Many women screened for STI were low risk and
universal testing strategies warrant evaluation.
