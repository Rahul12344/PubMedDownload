An outbreak of Salmonella enteritidis in a maternity and neonatal intensive care 
unit is described. The outbreak involved six babies and three mothers over a
period of 23 days. The index case presented with premature labour with
chorioamnionitis caused by S. enteritidis. There was no history of diarrhoea at
the time of her admission of during her pregnancy. The absence of illness led to 
a delay in instituting standard isolation procedures until S. enteritidis had
been isolated from the placenta four days after delivery. It appeared that the
resuscitator in the labour ward operating theatre acted as a reservoir for the
initial transmission with secondary person-to-person spread. Early introduction
of universal infection control measures including handwashing and appropriate
disinfection of equipment would have prevented the outbreak.
