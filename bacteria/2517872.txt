The influence of drugs used for selective decontamination, given in
therapeutically effective concentrations, was examined in healthy controls and
immunocompromised patients with hematologic systemic diseases by measuring the
zymosan-induced and luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence of peripheral leucocytes. 
Drug-induced repression of phagocytic activity could usually be found both in
healthy controls and in patients with hematologic systemic diseases. The
combination of trimethoprim and sulfamerazine had a pronounced repressive effect.
Such indications should be taken as a basis for further investigations in order
to avoid additional iatrogenic restriction of defence. If possible, drugs with
effects leading to repression of phagocytosis should not be used for selective
decontamination.
