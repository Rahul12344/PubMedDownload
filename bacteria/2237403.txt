Expression of the L-arabinose BAD operon in Escherichia coli is regulated by AraC
protein which acts both positively in the presence of arabinose to induce
transcription and negatively in the absence of arabinose to repress
transcription. The repression of the araBAD promoter is mediated by DNA looping
between AraC protein bound at two sites near the promoter separated by 210 base
pairs, araI and araO2. In vivo and in vitro experiments presented here show that 
an AraC dimer, with binding to half of araI and to araO2, maintains the repressed
state of the operon. The addition of arabinose, which induces the operon, breaks 
the loop, and shifts the interactions from the distal araO2 site to the
previously unoccupied half of the araI site. The conversion between the two
states does not require additional binding of AraC protein and appears to be
driven largely by properties of the protein rather than being specified by the
slightly different DNA sequences of the binding sites. Slight reorientation of
the subunits of AraC could specify looping or unlooping by the protein. Such a
mechanism could account for regulation of DNA looping in other systems.
