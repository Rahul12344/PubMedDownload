BACKGROUND: Glioma is the most common of all primary brain tumors with poor
prognosis and high mortality. The 2016 World Health Organization classification
of the tumors of central nervous system uses molecular parameters in addition to 
histology to redefine many tumor entities. The new classification scheme divides 
diffuse gliomas into low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) as per
histology. LGGs are further divided into isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild type
or mutant, which is further classified into either oligodendroglioma that harbors
1p/19q codeletion or diffuse astrocytoma that has an intact 1p/19q loci but
enriched for ATRX loss and TP53 mutation. GBMs are divided into IDH wild type
that corresponds to primary or de novo GBMs and IDH mutant that corresponds to
secondary or progressive GBMs. To make the 2016 WHO subtypes of diffuse gliomas
more robust, we carried out Prediction Analysis of Microarrays (PAM) to develop
DNA methylation signatures for these subtypes.
RESULTS: In this study, we applied PAM on a training set of diffuse gliomas
derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and identified DNA methylation
signatures to classify LGG IDH wild type from LGG IDH mutant, LGG IDH mutant with
1p/19q codeletion from LGG IDH mutant with intact 1p/19q loci and GBM IDH wild
type from GBM IDH mutant with an accuracy of 99-100%. The signatures were
validated using the test set of diffuse glioma samples derived from TCGA with an 
accuracy of 96 to 99%. In addition, we also carried out additional validation of 
all three signatures using independent LGG and GBM cohorts. Further, the
methylation signatures identified a fraction of samples as discordant, which were
found to have molecular and clinical features typical of the subtype as
identified by methylation signatures.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we identified methylation signatures that classified different
subtypes of diffuse glioma accurately and propose that these signatures could
complement 2016 WHO classification scheme of diffuse glioma.
