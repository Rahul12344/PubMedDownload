BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) plays an important role in
innate immunity. MBL deficiency is usually caused by mutations in exon 1 of the
MBL structural gene (MBL2). Our aim was to investigate MBL2 polymorphisms and
their relation to salivary levels of periodontal inflammatory/tissue destruction 
markers and two major periodontitis-associated bacteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Salivary samples from 222 subjects were available for
genotyping by pyrosequencing. The subjects between 40 and 60 years of age and
having a minimum of 20 teeth were divided into three periodontal groups: 80 had
generalized periodontitis, 65 had localized periodontitis and 77 were
periodontitis-free. A comparison between their MBL2 genotypes and salivary
detection rates and levels of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and
Porphyromonas gingivalis as well as interleukin -1β, matrix metalloproteinase -8,
and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 was performed.
RESULTS: The frequencies of the MBL2 wild-type (A/A), heterozygote variants (A/O)
and homozygote variants (O/O) were 69.4%, 26.6% and 4%, respectively. In A.
actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects having homozygote or heterozygote MBL2
variants, the salivary concentrations of IL-1β (p = 0.010) were elevated and
those of TIMP-1 (p = 0.001) were decreased. In addition their matrix
metalloproteinase -8/TIMP-1 ratio was higher (p < 0.001) and they had more pocket
teeth (p = 0.012) than subjects negative for A. actinomycetemcomitans.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the carriage of A. actinomycetemcomitans
may facilitate extended periodontal inflammation and destruction in subjects with
a variant form of human MBL2.
