In this study, engineered butanologenic Escherichia coli T5 constructed by the
OGAB method was used for 1-butanol production. The results showed the feasibility
of the artificial butanologenic operon, (Promoter
Pr)-thil-crt-bcd-etfB-etfA-hbd-adhe1-adhe, where the 1-butanol titer, specific
BuOH yield, and BuOH yield were 4.50 mg/L, 4.50 mg-BuOH/g cell, and 0.35
mg-BuOH/g-glucose, respectively. Fermentation conditions of anaerobic, low
initial concentrations of carbon sources, low oxidation state of carbon source,
pH of 6, addition of glutathione and citrate, had been shown for efficiently
improving the 1-butanol production. The premise behind these fermentation
approaches can be categorized into two lines of reasoning, either elevated the
availability of acetyl-CoA or lowered the intracellular redox state. By comparing
the fermentation conditions tested in this study, pH has been shown to be the
most efficiency strategies for 1-butanol production while the replacement of
glucose with glycerol provides the highest improvement in butanol yield.
