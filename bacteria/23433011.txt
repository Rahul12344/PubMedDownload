The oral and intestinal host tissues both carry a heavy microbial burden.
Although commensal bacteria contribute to healthy intestinal tissue structure and
function, their contribution to oral health is poorly understood. A crucial
component of periodontal health is the recruitment of neutrophils to periodontal 
tissue. To elucidate this process, gingival tissues of specific-pathogen-free and
germ-free wild-type mice and CXCR2KO and MyD88KO mice were examined for
quantitative analysis of neutrophils and CXCR2 chemoattractants (CXCL1, CXCL2).
We show that the recruitment of neutrophils to the gingival tissue does not
require commensal bacterial colonization but is entirely dependent on CXCR2
expression. Strikingly, however, commensal bacteria selectively upregulate the
expression of CXCL2, but not CXCL1, in a MyD88-dependent way that correlates with
increased neutrophil recruitment as compared with germ-free conditions. This is
the first evidence that the selective use of chemokine receptor ligands
contributes to neutrophil homing to healthy periodontal tissue.
