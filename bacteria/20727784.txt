Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is a source of primitive hematopoietic stem (HSC) and 
progenitor cells, that served as an alternative to bone marrow (BM) for effective
transplantation therapy. Success of HSC transplantation (HSCT) is limited in part
by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft rejection and delayed immune
reconstitution, which all relate to immunological complications. GVHD after UCB
transplantation is lower compared to that of BM HSCT. This may relate to the
tolerogenic nature of T cells, mononuclear cells (MNCs) and especially immune
regulatory cells existing in UCB. UCB contains limiting numbers of HSC or CD34(+)
cell dose for adult patients resulting in delayed engraftment after UCB
transplantation (UCBT). This needs to be improved for optimal transplantation
outcomes. Approaches have been undertaken to promote HSC engraftment, including
co-infusion of multiple units of UCB cells. These new methods however added
additional immunological complications. Herein, we describe current knowledge on 
features of UCB immune cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) and their potential future usage to reduce 
GVHD.
