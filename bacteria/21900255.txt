To understand the role of the splice regulator muscleblind 1 (MBNL1) in the
development of RNA splice defects in myotonic dystrophy I (DM1), we purified
RNA-independent MBNL1 complexes from normal human myoblasts and examined the
behavior of these complexes in DM1 myoblasts. Antibodies recognizing MBNL1
variants (MBNL1(CUG)), which can sequester in the toxic CUG RNA foci that develop
in DM1 nuclei, were used to purify MBNL1(CUG) complexes from normal myoblasts. In
normal myoblasts, MBNL1(CUG) bind 10 proteins involved in remodeling
ribonucleoprotein complexes including hnRNP H, H2, H3, F, A2/B1, K, L, DDX5,
DDX17, and DHX9. Of these proteins, only MBNL1(CUG) colocalizes extensively with 
DM1 CUG foci (>80% of foci) with its partners being present in <10% of foci.
Importantly, the stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes is altered in DM1
myoblasts, demonstrating an increase in the steady state levels of nine of its
partner proteins. These changes are recapitulated by the expression of expanded
CUG repeat RNA in Cos7 cells. Altered stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes
results from aberrant protein synthesis or stability and is unlinked to PKCÎ±
function. Modeling these changes in normal myoblasts demonstrates that increased 
levels of hnRNP H, H2, H3, F, and DDX5 independently dysregulate splicing in
overlapping RNA subsets. Thus expression of expanded CUG repeats alters the
stoichiometry of MBNL1(CUG) complexes to allow both the reinforcement and
expansion of RNA processing defects.
