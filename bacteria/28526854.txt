Glioblastoma is the most common type of adult brain tumour and has a median
survival after diagnosis of a little more than a year. Glioblastomas have a high 
frequency of mutations in the TERT promoter and CDKN2A locus that are expected to
render them resistant to both replicative and oncogene-induced senescence.
However, exposure of PriGO8A primary glioblastoma cells to media with 10% serum
induced a senescence-like phenotype characterized by increased
senescence-associated β galactosidase activity, PML bodies and p21 and
morphological changes typical of senescence. Microarray expression analysis
showed that 24 h serum exposure increased the expression of genes associated with
the TGFβ pathway. Treatment of PriGO8A cells with TGFβ was sufficient to induce
senescence in these cells. The response of PriGO8A cells to serum was dependent
on basal expression of the TGFβ activator protein thrombospondin. Primary
glioblastoma cells from three additional patients showed a variable ability to
undergo senescence in response to serum. However all were able to undergo
senescence in response to TGFβ, although for cells from one patient this required
concomitant inhibition of Ras pathway signalling. Primary glioblastoma cells
therefore retain a functional senescence program that is inducible by acute
activation of the TGFβ signalling pathway.
