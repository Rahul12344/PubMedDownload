OBJECTIVE: To estimate prevalence and determine association between antimicrobia 
resistance and toxin gene profile of Clostridium difficile in commercial pigs at 
the preharvest food-safety level.
ANIMALS: 68 sows and 251 young pigs from 5 farms in North Carolina and 3 in Ohio.
PROCEDURES: Fecal samples were collected from sows (8/farm) and matched young
pigs (32/farm) at farrowing and again at the nursery and finishing stages.
Clostridium difficile isolates were tested for susceptibility to 6
antimicrobials. A PCR assay was used to detect genes coding for enterotoxin A
(tcdA), cytotoxin B (tcdB), and binary toxin (cdtB).
RESULTS: C difficile prevalence in young pigs at farrowing was 73% (n=183) with
significantly higher prevalence in Ohio (875%) than in North Carolina (64%).
Clostridium difficile was isolated from 32 (47%) sows with no significant
difference between the 2 regions. A single pig had a positive test result at the 
nursery, and no isolate was recovered at the finishing farms. Resistance to
ciprofloxacin was predominant in young pigs (91.3% of isolates) and sows (94%).
The antimicrobial resistance profile ciprofloxacin-erythromycin-tetracycline was 
detected in 21.4% and 11.7% of isolates from young pigs and sows, respectively.
Most isolates had positive results for tcdA (65%), tcdB (84%), and the binary
toxin cdtB (77%) genes. Erythromycin resistance and tetracycline resistance were 
significantly associated with toxin gene profiles.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The common occurrence of
antimicrobial-resistant C difficile and the significant association of toxigenic 
strains with antimicrobial resistance could contribute to high morbidity in farms
with farrowing pigs.
