OBJECTIVE: Differentiation of infection from aseptic inflammation represents a
major clinical issue. None of the commercially available compounds (labeled
granulocytes, antigranulocyte antibodies, Ga-citrate, labeled immunoglobulin G,
F-FDG) is capable of this differentiation, producing a nonnegligible
false-positive rate. Recently, our group reported on a reliable labeling
procedure of the antimicrobial peptide human β-defensin 3 (HBD-3) with Tc. The
aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo Tc-HBD-3 uptake in a rat model of
infection.
METHODS: Recombinant HBD-3 was radiolabeled with Tc. Radiolabeling yield and
specific activity of the compound were calculated. Chromatographic behavior and
biological activity of Tc-HBD-3 were also assessed. An experimental model
involving Staphylococcus aureus-induced infection and carrageenan-induced aseptic
inflammation was performed in 5 Wistar rats. Serial planar scintigraphic
acquisitions were performed from 15 to 180 minutes after Tc-HBD-3 intravenous
administration. Radiotracer uptake was evaluated qualitatively and
semiquantitatively as a target-to-nontarget ratio.
RESULTS: Radiolabeling yield of Tc-HBD-3 was 70% with a specific activity of 6 to
8 MBq/μg. A significant and progressive Tc-HBD-3 uptake was observed in the site 
of S. aureus-induced infection, with a maximum average target-to-nontarget ratio 
of 5.7-fold higher in the infection site compared with an inflammation site
observed at 140 minutes.
CONCLUSIONS: In vivo imaging with Tc-HBD-3 in a rat model of S. aureus-induced
infection demonstrated favorable uptake in the infection site compared with
sterile inflammation and background. These promising results, together with
previous ex vivo uptake and toxicity assessment, suggest the potential of
Tc-HBD-3 as a novel agent for specific infection imaging.
