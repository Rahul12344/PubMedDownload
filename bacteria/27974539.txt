Streptococcus pneumoniae infections arising in hospitalized patients are often
assumed to be sporadic and linked to community acquisition. Here, whole-genome
sequencing was used to demonstrate nosocomial acquisition of
antimicrobial-resistant sequence type 156 (ST156) serotype 9V S. pneumoniae in 3 
respiratory patients that resulted in two bacteremias and one lower respiratory
tract infection. Two of the cases arose in patients who had recently been
discharged from the hospital and were readmitted from the community. Nosocomial
spread was suspected solely because of the highly unusual resistance pattern and 
case presentations within 24 h of one another. The outbreak highlights the
potential for rapid transmission and the short incubation period in the
respiratory ward setting.
