1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) is a toxic and recalcitrant
pesticide that has been greatly used to eradicate malaria mosquitos since the
1940s. However, the US Environmental Protection Agency banned and classified DDT 
as priority pollutants due to its negative impact on wildlife and human health.
Considering its negative effects, it is necessary to develop effective methods of
DDT degradation. A synergistic interaction of a consortium consisting of the
brown-rot fungus Fomitopsis pinicola and the bacterium Ralstonia pickettii was
adopted to degrade DDT. For the microbial consortia, F. pinicola was mixed with
R. pickettii at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 ml (1 ml ≈ 1.44 × 1013 CFU) in a potato
dextrose broth (PDB) medium to degrade DDT throughout the seven days incubation
period. The degradation of DDT by only the fungus F. pinicola was roughly 42%,
while by only R. pickettii was 31%. The addition of 3 ml of R. pickettii into
F. pinicola culture presented appropriate optimization for efficient DDT
degradation at roughly 61%. The DDT transformation pathway by co-inoculation of
F. pinicola and R. pickettii showed that DDT was converted to
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD), further transformed to
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), and then ultimately
transformed to 1-chloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU). These
metabolites are less toxic than DDT. This research showed that R. picketti
synergistically interacts with F. pinicola by enhancing DDT degradation.
