beta-defensin 2 is produced by a variety of epithelial cell types in the body and
exhibits potent antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens, including 
the bacteria that are most commonly associated with otitis media (OM). The human 
beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) gene is an NF-kappa B regulated gene and a variety of
proinflammatory stimuli can induce its expression. Although the presence of
molecules of innate immunity such as lysozyme and lactoferrin has been
demonstrated in the middle ear, to date there have been no reports on the
expression of beta-defensin 2. In the present study, we demonstrate that
beta-defensin 2 is expressed in the middle ear mucosa of humans and rats. We also
show that it is expressed in a human middle ear epithelial cell line and that its
expression is induced by proinflammatory stimuli such as interleukin 1 alpha
(IL-1 alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Moreover, we demonstrate that the transcriptional activation of hBD-2 gene
by IL-1 alpha is mediated through an Src-dependent Raf-MEK1/2-ERK signaling
pathway.
