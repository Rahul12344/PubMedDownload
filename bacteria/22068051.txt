Autophagy controls the quality and quantity of the eukaryotic cytoplasm while
performing two evolutionarily highly conserved functions: cell-autonomous
provision of energy and nutrients by cytosol autodigestion during starvation, and
removal of defunct organelles and large aggregates exceeding the capacity of
other cellular degradative systems. In contrast to these autodigestive processes,
autophagy in yeast has additional, biogenesis functions. However, no equivalent
biosynthetic roles have been described for autophagy in mammals. Here, we show
that in mammalian cells, autophagy has a hitherto unappreciated positive
contribution to the biogenesis and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine
IL-1β via an export pathway that depends on Atg5, inflammasome, at least one of
the two mammalian Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) paralogues, GRASP55
(GORASP2) and Rab8a. This process, which is a type of unconventional secretion,
expands the functional manifestations of autophagy beyond autodigestive and
quality control roles in mammals. It enables a subset of cytosolic proteins
devoid of signal peptide sequences, and thus unable to access the conventional
pathway through the ER, to enter an autophagy-based secretory pathway
facilitating their exit from the cytoplasm.
