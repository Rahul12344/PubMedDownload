CD28 is the major costimulatory receptor required for activation of naïve T
cells, yet CD28 costimulation affects the expression level of surprisingly few
genes over those altered by TCR stimulation alone. Alternate splicing of genes
adds diversity to the proteome and contributes to tissue-specific regulation of
genes. Here we demonstrate that CD28 costimulation leads to major changes in
alternative splicing during activation of naïve T cells, beyond the effects of
TCR alone. CD28 costimulation affected many more genes through modulation of
alternate splicing than by modulation of transcription. Different families of
biological processes are over-represented among genes alternatively spliced in
response to CD28 costimulation compared to those genes whose transcription is
altered, suggesting that alternative splicing regulates distinct biological
effects. Moreover, genes dependent upon hnRNPLL, a global regulator of splicing
in activated T cells, were enriched in T cells activated through TCR plus CD28 as
compared to TCR alone. We show that hnRNPLL expression is dependent on CD28
signaling, providing a mechanism by which CD28 can regulate splicing in T cells
and insight into how hnRNPLL can influence signal-induced alternative splicing in
T cells. The effects of CD28 on alternative splicing provide a newly appreciated 
means by which CD28 can regulate T cell responses.
