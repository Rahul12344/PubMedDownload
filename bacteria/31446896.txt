BACKGROUND: Insufficient co-stimulation accounts for a great deal of the
suboptimal activation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTLs) and presumably
unsatisfactory clinical expectation of PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Tumor-derived soluble
NKG2D ligands are associated with poor clinical response to PD1/PD-L1 blockade
therapy in cancer patients. One of the mostly occurring tumor-derived soluble
NKG2D ligands, the soluble MHC I chain related molecule (sMIC) can impair
co-stimulation to CD8 T cells. We investigated whether co-targeting sMIC can
provide optimal co-stimulation to CTLs and enhance the therapeutic effect of
PD1/PD-L1 blockades.
METHODS: Single agent therapy of a PD1/PD-L1 blockade antibody or a
sMIC-targeting non-blocking antibody or a combination therapy of the two
antibodies were implied to well-characterized pre-clinical MIC/sMIC+ tumor models
that closely resemble the NKG2D-mediated oncoimmune dynamics of MIC+ cancer
patients. Therapeutic efficacy and associated effector mechanisms were evaluated.
RESULTS: We show that antibody co-targeting sMIC enables or enhances the response
of sMIC+ tumors to PD1/PD-L1 blockade therapy. The therapy response of the
combination therapy was associated with enhanced antigen-specific CD8 T cell
enrichment and function in tumors. We show that co-targeting sMIC with a
nonblocking antibody provides antigen-specific CD8 T cells with NKG2D and CD28
dual co-stimulation, in addition to elimination of inhibitory signals, and thus
amplifies antigen-specific CD8 T cell anti-tumor responses.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide the proof-of-concept rationale and previously
undiscovered mechanisms for co-targeting sMIC to enable and enhance the response 
to PD1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in sMIC+ cancer patients.
