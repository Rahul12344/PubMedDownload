HLA-A, -B and -C alleles of 285 individuals, representing three Iranian Lur
populations and one Iranian Kurd population were sequenced completely, yielding
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I genotypes at high resolution and filling
four fields of the official HLA nomenclature. Each population has 87-99 alleles, 
evenly distributed between the three HLA class I genes, 145 alleles being
identified in total. These alleles were already known, named and deposited in the
HLA database. The alleles form 316 different HLA A-B-C haplotypes, with each
population having between 80 and 112 haplotypes. The four Iranian populations
form a related group that is distinguished from other populations, including
other Iranians. All four KIR ligands - the A3/11, Bw4, C1 and C2 epitopes - are
well represented, particularly Bw4, which is carried by three high-frequency
allotypes: HLA-A*24:02, HLA-A*32:01 and HLA-B*51:01. In the Lur and Kurd
populations, between 82% and 94% of individuals have the Bw4 epitope, the ligand 
for KIR3DL1. HLA-B*51:01 is likely of Neandertal origin and associated with
Behcet's disease, also known as the Silk Road disease. The Lordegan Lur have the 
highest frequency of HLA-B*51:01 in the world. This allele is present on 46 Lur
and Kurd haplotypes. Present at lower frequency is HLA-B*51:08, which is also
associated with Behcet's disease. In the four Iranian populations, 31 haplotypes 
encode both Bw4(+) HLA-A and Bw4(+) HLA-B, a dual combination of Bw4 epitopes
that is relatively rare in other populations, worldwide. This study both
demonstrates and emphasizes the value of studying HLA class I polymorphism at
highest resolution in anthropologically well-defined populations.
