Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of corneal infection. CXC receptor 2
binding chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa keratitis. The role of this receptor in immune responses during
Staphylococcus keratitis remains to be fully understood. Corneas of CXC receptor 
2 knockout and wild-type mice (Cmkar -/- & Cmkar +/+) were scratched and
1 × 10(8) cfu/ml of strain Staph 38 applied. Twenty-four hours post-infection,
mice were sacrificed and eyes harvested for enumeration of bacteria and
measurement of myeloperoxidase levels. Production of inflammatory mediators,
cellular adhesion molecules and chemokines in response to infection were
investigated by ELISA, and PCR. 24 h after challenge with S. aureus, Cmkar -/-
mice had developed a more severe response with a 50-fold higher bacterial load
than WT mice. PMNs failed to penetrate the corneas of Cmkar -/- mice. However,
concentrations of KC, MIP-2, IL-1β and IL-6 were significantly elevated (6-13
fold) in Cmkar-/- mice. The concentration of LTB4 was decreased (2 fold).
Cmkar-/- mice failed to upregulate mRNA for VCAM-1 or PECAM-1 in response to
infection, but had constitutively higher levels of ICAM-1. A lack of CXC receptor
2 lead to an inability to control bacterial numbers as a result of failure of
PMNs to penetrate the cornea to the site of infection, even when chemokines were 
more highly produced. These results imply that CXCR2-mediated signaling through
upregulation of adhesion molecules is essential to margination of PMNs in this
infection model.
