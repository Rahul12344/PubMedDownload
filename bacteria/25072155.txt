Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are crucial components of host defense against
microbial challenge but the associations of HLA types with oral infectious
diseases have not been studied in detail. This prospective cross-sectional study 
examined associations of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 types with common oral diseases in a
healthy Swiss adult population. 257 subjects (107 m, 150 f, mean age: 43.5 yr;
range: 21-58 yr) with known HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 profiles and comprehensive
medical records were included. A thorough anamnesis was followed by oral
examinations including saliva flow measurements, the DMFT score for cariological 
status, complete periodontal status with plaque and bleeding indexes as well as
assessment of mucosal alterations and temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD).
Student's t-test and Pearson chi-square test were utilized to compare the oral
diseases between HLA positive and negative subjects. Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons was used and PBonf<0.05 was considered statistically
significant. HLA types -B15 (PBonf = 0.002), -B51 (PBonf = 0.02) and -DRB1*12
(PBonf = 0.02) were associated with less periodontal disease manifestations.
HLA-A32 had a positive association with TMD dysfunction (PBonf = 0.012). No other
statistically significant associations were observed. In conclusion, HLA types
may contribute to the development of oral diseases in generally healthy Caucasian
adults.
