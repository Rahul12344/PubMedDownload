Conjugation plays an important role in the horizontal movement of DNA between
bacterial species and even genera. Large conjugative plasmids in Gram-negative
bacteria are associated with multi-drug resistance and have been implicated in
the spread of these phenotypes to pathogenic organisms. A/C plasmids often carry 
genes that confer resistance to multiple classes of antibiotics. Recently,
transcription factors were characterized that regulate A/C conjugation. In this
work, we expanded the regulon of the negative regulator Acr2. We developed an A/C
variant, pARK01, by precise removal of resistance genes carried by the plasmid in
order to make it more genetically tractable. Using pARK01, we conducted RNA-Seq
and ChAP-Seq experiments to characterize the regulon of Acr2, an H-NS-like
protein. We found that Acr2 binds several loci on the plasmid. We showed, in
vitro, that Acr2 can bind specific promoter regions directly and identify key
amino acids which are important for this binding. This study further
characterizes Acr2 and suggests its role in modulating gene expression of
multiple plasmid and chromosomal loci.
