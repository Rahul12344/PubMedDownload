The inflammatory human chemokine CXCL5 interacts with the G protein-coupled
receptor CXCR2 to induce chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils. CXCL5 also has
weak agonist activity toward CXCR1. The N-terminus of CXCL5 can be modified by
proteolytic cleavage or deimination of Arg9 to citrulline (Cit), and these
modifications can occur separately or together. Here, we chemically synthesized
native CXCL5(1-78), truncated CXCL5 [CXCL5(9-78)], and the citrullinated (Cit9)
versions and characterized their functions in vitro and in vivo. Compared with
full-length CXCL5, N-terminal truncation resulted in enhanced potency to induce G
protein signaling and β-arrestin recruitment through CXCR2, increased
CXCL5-initiated internalization of CXCR2, and greater Ca2+ signaling downstream
of not only CXCR2 but also CXCR1. Citrullination did not affect the capacity of
CXCL5 to activate classical or alternative signaling pathways. Administering the 
various CXCL5 forms to mice revealed that in addition to neutrophils, CXCL5
exerted chemotactic activity toward monocytes and that this activity was
increased by N-terminal truncation. These findings were confirmed by in vitro
chemotaxis and Ca2+ signaling assays with primary human CD14+ monocytes and human
THP-1 monocytes. In vitro and in vivo analyses suggested that CXCL5 targeted
monocytes through CXCR1 and CXCR2. Thus, truncation of the N-terminus makes CXCL5
a more potent chemoattractant for both neutrophils and monocytes that acts
through CXCR1 and CXCR2.
