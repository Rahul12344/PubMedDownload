To elucidate the involvement of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in systemic
inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis, we investigated the plasma
levels of HGF, as well as those of various proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, in 50 patients who visited our emergency department (ED). The patients
were divided into four groups, depending on the existence of SIRS and infection: 
group 1 (G1), no infection and no SIRS; group 2 (G2), infection and no SIRS;
group 3 (G3), no infection and SIRS; and group 4 (G4), infection and SIRS (e.g., 
sepsis). We found that plasma HGF levels in G4 were significantly higher than
those in the groups without infection (G1 and G3). However, the correlations
between HGF and other cytokines were comparatively low compared with those
between any other pairs of cytokines, suggesting independent regulation of HGF
production in vivo. High plasma HGF was significantly correlated with the
presence of infection and with serum total bilirubin (TB) level on multivariate
logistic regression analysis. Considering HGF's known functions, we speculated
that high plasma HGF levels may indicate the occurrence or necessity for tissue
protection and regeneration after acute systemic insults in sepsis.
