The need of alkaline detergent-stable lipases has been growing rapidly as they
are highly attractive for the production of detergents, biodiesel,
pharmaceuticals agents, and various other applications. Lipase from Pseudomonas
mendocina (PML) is one such candidate with triglyceride activity and
non-homologous with other reported Pseudomonas lipases. The present work provides
insights on the role of amino acids toward structural stability of PML. PML was
subjected to mutagenesis through in silico point mutations for emulating its
structural stability, the foremost property to enhance biophysiochemical
properties for industrial process. The structural effects of identified mutants
on PML have been analyzed through comparative atomistic molecular dynamics
simulations on wild type and mutants. The in silico mutants P187A and P219A were 
found to stabilize their respective local dynamics and improved the structural
stability of PML. The current study sheds light on the rational engineering of
PML through in silico methodologies to improvise its structural stability as well
as prototype for rational engineering of the lipases.
