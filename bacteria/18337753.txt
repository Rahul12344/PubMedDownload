Autophagy is a newly recognized innate defense mechanism, acting as a
cell-autonomous system for elimination of intracellular pathogens. The signals
and signalling pathways inducing autophagy in response to pathogen invasion are
presently not known. Here we show that autophagy is controlled by recognizing
conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). We screened a PAMP
library for effects on autophagy in RAW 264.7 macrophages and found that several 
prototype Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands induced autophagy. Single-stranded RNA
and TLR7 generated the most potent effects. Induction of autophagy via TLR7
depended on MyD88 expression. Stimulation of autophagy with TLR7 ligands was
functional in eliminating intracellular microbes, even when the target pathogen
was normally not associated with TLR7 signalling. These findings link two innate 
immunity defense systems, TLR signalling and autophagy, provide a potential
molecular mechanism for induction of autophagy in response to pathogen invasion, 
and show that the newly recognized ability of TLR ligands to stimulate autophagy 
can be used to treat intracellular pathogens.
