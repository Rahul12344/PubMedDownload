The causes and mechanisms of autoimmune disease pose continuing challenges to the
scientific community. Recent clues implicate a peculiar feature of neutrophils,
their ability to release nuclear chromatin in the form of neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs), in the induction or progression of autoimmune
disease. Efforts to define the beneficial versus detrimental effects of NET
release have, as yet, only partially revealed mechanisms that guide this process.
Evidence suggests that the process of NET release is highly regulated, but the
details of regulation remain controversial and obscure. Without a better
understanding of the factors that initiate and control NET formation, the
judicious modification of neutrophil behaviour for medically useful purposes
appears remote. We highlight gaps and inconsistencies in published work, which
make NETs and their role in health and disease a puzzle that deserves more
focused attention.
