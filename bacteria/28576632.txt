We identified a di-substituted triazolopyrimidine with anti-tubercular activity
against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Three segments of the scaffold were examined 
rationally to establish a structure-activity relationship with the goal of
improving potency and maintaining good physicochemical properties. A number of
compounds displayed sub-micromolar activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis
with no cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells. Non-substituted aromatic rings at 
C5 and a two-carbon chain connecting a terminal aromatic at C7 were preferred
features; the presence of NH at C7 and a lack of substituent at C2 were essential
for potency. We identified compounds with acceptable metabolic stability in
rodent and human liver microsomes. Our findings suggest that the
easily-synthesized triazolopyrimidines are a promising class of potent
anti-tubercular agents and warrant further investigation in our search for new
drugs to fight tuberculosis.
