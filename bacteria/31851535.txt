The chemokine receptor CXCR2 is a receptor for CXC chemokines, including CXCL1
and CXCL2. CXCR2 is expressed by resident cells of the central nervous system,
including neurons, microglia, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and
oligodendrocytes. CXCR2 signaling is important in regulating OPC biology with
regard to positional migration and myelination during development. More recently,
studies have argued that CXCR2 is involved in controlling events related to
remyelination after experimentally induced demyelination. This review examines
the concept that targeting CXCR2 may offer a novel therapeutic target for
promoting remyelination.
