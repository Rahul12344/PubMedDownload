Multidrug-resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6/ABCC6) belongs to the ABC
transporter family, whose members share many characteristic features including
membrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2). These
function cooperatively to bind and hydrolyze ATP for the transport of substrates 
across biological membranes. In this study, MRP6-NBD2 (residues 1252-1503) was
expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and structurally and functionally
characterized. CD spectra suggested that the protein is folded. Furthermore, NBD2
is shown to be biologically active as it binds ATP and presents ATPase activity
although significantly lower compared with isolated NBD1. The mixture of NBD2 and
NBD1 exhibited an activity similar to the NBD2 alone, indicating that NBD1 and
NBD2 form a heterodimer with the latter limiting ATP hydrolysis. These findings
suggest that NBD1 has a higher tendency to form an active homodimer, which is
also supported by in silico analysis of energy-minimized dimers of the homology
models of the two domains.
