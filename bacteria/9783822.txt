The lipopolysaccharides (LPS) of Porphyromonas gingivalis are implicated in the
initiation and development of periodontal diseases. However, the mechanisms
underlying P. gingivalis LPS-mediated periodontal destruction are still unknown. 
Here, it was found that P. gingivalis LPS activates human gingival fibroblasts
(HGF) to release interleukin 6 (IL-6) via CD14. Flow-cytometric analysis showed
that HGFs bind to fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled LPS, and express
CD14 on their surfaces. The binding of FITC LPS was competitively suppressed by
unlabelled synthetic lipid A as well as by LPS. LPS-induced IL-6 production was
inhibited by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody in a dose-dependent manner. The
binding of FITC LPS to HGF was abrogated by anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody.
Engagement of LPS initiated the protein tyrosine phosphorylation of several
intracellular proteins including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1
and 2, and these events were suppressed by the anti-CD14 monoclonal. These
results suggest that CD14 is a cell surface binding site for LPS and is involved 
in the LPS-mediated activation of HGF.
