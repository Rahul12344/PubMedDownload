Knockout mice for CXC receptor 2 (CXCR2) chemokine receptor were used to study
the recruitment of neutrophils during acute and chronic inflammatory responses.
When treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), either intraperitoneally or
intratracheally, these animals had a significant reduction in the neutrophil
recruitment in the first 24-48 h as compared with control mice. During 15 days of
intraperitoneal infection by Mycobacterium avium, the knockout mice showed
significantly reduced numbers of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity as compared
with the control mice. In contrast, the recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs
during an aerogenic M. avium infection was not affected by the CXCR2 mutation
throughout the 60 days of the study. Finally, we could not find any impact of the
mutation on the mycobacterial growth of the infected animals. These findings
indicate that CXCR2 may be essentially involved in acute inflammatory responses
where an early and rapid recruitment of neutrophils is observed.
