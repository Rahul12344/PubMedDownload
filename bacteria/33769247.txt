In March 2019, a pertussis outbreak occurred in children in a junior school (7-11
years) in England who had been offered pertussis-containing booster vaccine at 40
months of age. In a case-control investigation, we assessed the extent of
transmission and any difference in protection afforded to those who had
previously received a booster 3- or 5-component acellular pertussis vaccine (aP).
We took oral fluid specimens from the students to determine IgG antibodies
against pertussis toxin (anti-PT). Parents of students attending the school were 
sent a questionnaire on pertussis symptoms and vaccination status was retrieved
from general practitioner records for all students. Of 381 students, 134 (35.2%) 
were classified as pertussis cases, 133 by demonstration of significant anti-PT
IgG titres and one clinically. There was no significant difference in the risk of
pertussis between students receiving 3-component (33.7%) or 5-component (32.3%)
aP boosters. However, pertussis infection differed significantly in school year
4, with 22.9%, 50.0%, 23.7% and 38.1% pertussis cases in years 3, 4, 5 and 6,
respectively. The proportion of students with incomplete vaccinations recorded
was higher than the proportion of those not covered according to the national
reported coverage, possibly contributing to sustained transmission within the
school.
