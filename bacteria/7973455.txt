CD28 interaction with B7 molecules, expressed on the membranes of
antigen-presenting cells, co-stimulates cytokine production, T-cell proliferation
and generation of cytotoxic lymphocytes. The expression of CD28 markers on CD4+
and CD8+ lymphocytes was studied in a group of subjects at various stages of HIV 
infection. A reduction in the percentage of CD28-bearing CD4+ and CD8+ cell
subsets was observed during the asymptomatic stage of the disease. This reduction
was more pronounced in AIDS than in non-AIDS patients. At the same time, an
increase in the absolute CD8+CD28- cell number (greater in stage A than in stage 
B and C subjects) was observed in HIV-infected patients. The finding of an
altered pattern of CD28 expression on T cells might per se explain certain early 
defects in the cytokine pattern and in the immune response peculiar to
HIV-infected patients.
