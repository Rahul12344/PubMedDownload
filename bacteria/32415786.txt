OBJECTIVE: Sodium valproate (VPA), the most effective antiepileptic drug for
patients with genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE), is a potent human teratogen
that increases the risk of a range of congenital malformations, including spina
bifida. The mechanisms underlying this teratogenicity are not known, but may
involve genetic risk factors. This study aimed to develop an animal model of
VPA-induced birth defects.
METHODS: We used three different rat strains: inbred Genetic Absence Epilepsy
Rats From Strasbourg (GAERS), a model of GGE with absence seizures; inbred
Non-Epileptic Controls (NEC); and outbred nonepileptic Wistars. Female rats were 
fed standard chow or VPA (20 g/kg food) mixed in standard chow for 2 weeks prior 
to conception, and then mated with same-strain males. Treatment continued
throughout pregnancy. Fetuses were extracted via C-section on gestational day 21 
and examined for birth defects, including external assessment and spinal
measurements.
RESULTS: VPA-exposed pups showed significant reductions in weight, length, and
whole-body development compared with controls of all three strains (P < .0001).
Gestational VPA treatment altered intravertebral distances, and resulted in
underdeveloped vertebral arches between thoracic region T11 and caudal region C2 
in most pups (GAERS, 100%; NEC, 95%; Wistar, 80%), more frequently than in
controls (9%, 13%, 19%).
SIGNIFICANCE: Gestational VPA treatment results in similar developmental and
morphological abnormalities in three rat strains, including one with GGE,
indicating that the genetic underpinnings of epilepsy do not contribute markedly 
to VPA-induced birth defects. This model may be used in future studies to
investigate mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of antiepileptic drug-induced
birth defects.
