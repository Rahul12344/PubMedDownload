BACKGROUND: Patient activation is associated with better outcomes and lower
costs. Although the concept is widely investigated, little attention was given to
patient activation and its predictors in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Hence,
we aimed to investigate the level of patient activation and aimed to determine
patient- and treatment-related predictors of activation in patients undergoing
hemodialysis.
METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study recruited patients undergoing
hemodialysis in three Flemish hospitals. Participants were questioned about
patient characteristics (i.e., age, sex, education, employment, children, social 
support, leisure-time, living condition, and care at home), treatment- and
health-related characteristics (i.e., hospital, time since first dialysis,
transplantation, self-reported health (EQ-VAS) and depressive symptoms (PHQ-2)), 
and patient activation (PAM-13). Univariate and multiple linear regression
analyses with dummy variables were conducted to investigate the associations
between the independent variables and patient activation.
RESULTS: The average patient activation-score was 51. Of 192 patients, 44%
patients did not believe they had an important role regarding their health.
Multiple linear regression showed that older patients, who reported being in bad 
health, treated in a particular hospital, without leisure-time activities, and
living in a residential care home, had lower patient activation. These variables 
explained 31% of the variance in patient activation. Based on literature, we
found that activation of patients on hemodialysis is low, compared to that of
other chronic patient groups.
CONCLUSION: It could be useful to implement patient activation monitoring, since 
the level of activation is low in patients undergoing hemodialysis. Older
patients, who reported being in bad health, treated in a particular hospital,
without leisure-time activities, living in a residential care home, are at higher
risk for lower activation.
