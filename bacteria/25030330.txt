We report a case of infective endocarditis (IE) involving the posterior mitral
leaflet (PML) with calcific embolization in a patient with hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Amongst HOCM patients with IE, the anterior
mitral leaflet and basal septal myocardium are almost always involved due to the 
endocardial damage caused by recurrent outflow obstruction and valvular
regurgitation. The management of our patient was complicated by moderate mitral
stenosis, repeated calcific embolic strokes, dynamic left ventricular outflow
track obstruction, and respiratory failure due to flash pulmonary edema. To our
knowledge, this is the first reported case of PML involvement in HOCM presenting 
in this manner.
