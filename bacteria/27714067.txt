Nanoassemblies presenting multivalent displays of biologically active
carbohydrates are of significant interest for a wide array of biomedical
applications ranging from drug delivery to immunotherapy. In this study,
glycodendron-lipid hybrids were developed as a new and tunable class of dendritic
amphiphiles. A modular synthesis was used to prepare dendron-lipid hybrids
comprising distearylglycerol and 0 through 4th generation polyester dendrons with
peripheral protected amines. Following deprotection of the amines, an
isothiocyanate derivative of C-linked α-galactose (α-Gal) was conjugated to the
dendron peripheries, affording amphiphiles with 1 to 16 α-Gal moieties.
Self-assembly in water through a solvent exchange process resulted in vesicles
for the 0 through 2nd generation systems and micelles for the 3rd and 4th
generation systems. The critical aggregation concentrations decreased with
increasing dendron generation, suggesting that the effects of increasing molar
mass dominated over the effects of increasing the hydrophilic weight fraction.
The binding of the assemblies to Griffonia simplicifolia Lectin I (GSL 1), a
protein with specificity for α-Gal was studied by quantifying the binding of
fluorescently labeled assemblies to GSL 1-coated beads. It was found that binding
was enhanced for amphiphiles containing higher generation dendrons. Despite their
substantial structural differences with the natural ligands for the CD1d
receptor, the glycodendron-lipid hybrids were capable of stimulating invariant
natural killer T (iNKT) cells, a class of innate-like T cells that recognize
lipid and glycolipid antigens presented by CD1d and that are implicated in a wide
range of diseases and conditions including but not limited to infectious
diseases, diabetes and cancer.
