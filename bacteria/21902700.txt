AIM: To evaluate and observe the cellular reactions that occur during the
interaction/integration between 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate/host tissue/microbial
environment, in a co-culture of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and
Streptococcus mitis strains.
METHODOLOGY: Streptococcus mitis were cultured with strains in the presence of 3 
mmol L(-1) HEMA for 48 h and 72 h. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the trypan blue 
dye exclusion test. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL analysis. Adhesion was
evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. Quantitative analyses 
of the results were acquired by Qwin Plus 3.5 and QuantityOne I-D analysis
software, respectively. The statistical significance of the results was evaluated
using t-tests and linear regression tests.
RESULTS: The trypan blue dye test revealed 47.3% and 46.5% of dead fibroblasts
after 48 and 72 h HEMA treatment, respectively, while bacterial viability was not
influenced by the presence of HEMA and fibroblasts. The expression of
pro-collagen I, involved in fibroblast adhesion, in untreated samples ranged from
12.49% to 6.91% of the positive area after 48 and 72 h, respectively, dropping to
below 2% of the positive area in the other experimental conditions. Unlike the
trypan blue test, co-cultured samples treated with HEMA showed 20% and 25% versus
17% and 21% (after 48 and 72 h, respectively) of apoptotic cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for HEMA toxicity and anti-adhesive effects against
eukaryotic cells was reduced in the presence of bacteria, suggesting that dental 
resins should be well polymerized to avoid the spread of toxic monomers within
the mouth.
