The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of L. pneumophila in hot
water samples from hot water tanks and instantaneous devices. Tanks and devices
were all operated by heat exchangers employed in the town's district heating
system. Thirty-six out of 171 (21%) hot water samples tested positive for L.
pneumophila isolation, with 14.6% belonging to serogroup 1 and 6.4% to serogroups
2-14. The proportion of L. pneumophila detected in hot water reservoirs (30%) was
higher than that observed in hot water instantaneous devices (6.2%). Differences 
in L. pneumophila isolation reflected different temperatures registered at the
faucet: </=50 degrees C for hot water from reservoir devices, and >60 degrees C
for hot water from instantaneous devices. These data emphasize the need to
control temperature in hot water distribution devices, thus inhibiting the
formation of biofilm and L. pneumophila colonization.
