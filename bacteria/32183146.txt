Evodiamine (EVO) is an indoloquinazoline alkaloid that exerts its various
anti-oncogenic actions by blocking phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B
(PI3K/Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), c-Met, and nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathways, thus leading to apoptosis of tumor cells. We 
investigated the ability of EVO to affect hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced 
c-Met/Src/STAT3 activation cascades in castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC). First, we noted that EVO showed cytotoxicity and anti-proliferation
activities in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Next, we found that EVO markedly inhibited
HGF-induced c-Met/Src/STAT3 phosphorylation and impaired the nuclear
translocation of STAT3 protein. Then, we noted that EVO arrested the cell cycle, 
caused apoptosis, and downregulated the expression of various carcinogenic
markers such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), 
cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), survivin, vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and matrix metallopeptidases 9 (MMP-9). Moreover, it was observed that in
cPC-3 and DU145 cells transfected with c-Met small interfering RNA (siRNA),
Src/STAT3 activation was also mitigated and led to a decrease in EVO-induced
apoptotic cell death. According to our results, EVO can abrogate the activation
of the c-Met/Src/STAT3 signaling axis and thus plays a role as a robust
suppressor of tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis.
