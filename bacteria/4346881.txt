Identification of the synthesis of guanosine tetraphosphate (MS I) as insertion
of a pyrophosphoryl group into the 3'-position in guanosine 5'-diphosphate.

Sy J, Lipmann F.

The phosphate transfer system of Haseltine et al., consisting of a ribosomal wash
obtained from a stringent strain of Escherichia coli, washed ribosomes, GTP, and 
ATP, was used to prepare large quantities of guanosine tetra- and
pentaphosphates, the magic spot compounds MS I and MS II of Cashel and Gallant.
In our hands, the Haseltine et al. system yielded predominantly guanosine
tetraphosphate, ppGpp. This system was used exclusively in the described
experiments, with ATP labeled with (32)P in the beta- and gamma-positions as
donor. The beta-label was found to produce a ppG[unk]p and the gamma-label a ppGp
0001000 1101011 0011100 0011100 1101011 0001000 0000000 0101100 1110010 0100001
0100001 0100001 0110010 0101100 0100000 0100000 1110000 . Furthermore, [(3)H]GDP 
+ [gamma-(32)P]ATP yielded ppGpp in a (3)H:(32)P ratio of 1:1. The results
indicate a transfer of the terminal pyrophosphoryl group of ATP as a unit. The
position of the transferred pyrophosphoryl was assayed for by preparation of pG
from ppGp with Zn(++)-activated inorganic pyrophosphatase from yeast. The pG was 
then assayed with 3'-nucleotidase, which liberated practically all the labeled
phosphate. This result indicate that the phosphate transfer from ATP to GDP
yields guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate.
