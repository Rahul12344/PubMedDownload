The stimulation of programmed cell death can either enhance or inhibit antigen
presentation by classic major histocompatibility complex molecules. In the
current study, we report that the induction of apoptosis by topoisomerase I
inhibition or elevation of intracellular ceramide levels substantially impairs
CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. In the former case, such a reduction occurred
via the regulation of both the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein 
kinase C delta signal transduction pathways as well as the caspase cascade,
whereas the latter was p38-(but not caspase)-dependent. Confocal microscopic
analysis showed an altered intracellular distribution of CD1d following the
inhibition topoisomerase I or by an increase in intracellular ceramide levels,
that was prevented by p38 and caspase inhibitors. Thus, the induction of
apoptosis in antigen presenting cells severely compromises CD1d-mediated antigen 
presentation by multiple mechanisms.
