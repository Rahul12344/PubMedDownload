Phytoremediation together with microorganisms may confer the advantages of both
phytoremediation and microbial remediation of soils containing organic
contaminants. In this system biosurfactants produced by Pseudomonas sp. SB may
effectively help to increase the bioavailability of organic pollutants and
thereby enhance their microbial degradation in soil. Plants may enhance the
rhizosphere environment for microorganisms and thus promote the bioremediation of
contaminants. In the present pot experiment study,
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) residues underwent an apparent decline
after soil bioremediation compared with the original soil. The removal efficiency
of fertilizer + tall fescue, fertilizer + tall fescue + Pseudomonas,
fertilizer + perennial ryegrass, and fertilizer + perennial
ryegrass + Pseudomonas treatments were 59.4, 65.6, 69.0, and 65.9%, respectively,
and were generally higher than that in the fertilizer control (40.3%). Principal 
coordinates analysis (PCoA) verifies that plant species greatly affected the soil
bacterial community irrespective of inoculation with Pseudomonas sp. SB.
Furthermore, community composition analysis shows that Proteobacteria,
Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria were the three dominant phyla in all groups. In 
particular, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas for fertilizer + tall
fescue + Pseudomonas (0.25%) was significantly greater than fertilizer + tall
fescue and this was related to the DDT removal efficiency.
