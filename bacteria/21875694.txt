Mechanisms of peripheral tolerance maintain a controlled balance between
self-tolerance, protective immunity against a spectrum of non-self antigens, and 
suppressing pathology in various disorders. CD4(+) regulatory T cells (T(reg))
expressing the Foxp3 transcription factor dominantly control the activity and
pathological consequences of a variety of effector T cell lineages in various
inflammatory settings. This review will focus on recent advances on the roles of 
B7 family members in regulating Treg cell development, function and homeostasis
during tolerance induction and organ-specific autoimmunity.
