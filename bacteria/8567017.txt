It is well documented that the proliferative capacity of T cells declines with
advancing age. There are, however, conflicting data as to the role of the
accessory cell and whether or not this loss in responsiveness extends to all
T-cell stimuli and to all T cells. We report here on the capacity of
subpopulations of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from the healthy aged to
proliferate in response to anti-CD2 receptor-induced activation in the complete
absence of accessory cells by using various exogenous cofactors as second
signals. These costimulatory factors included phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-7 and the monoclonal antibodies,
anti-CD28 and anti-CD44. Under these conditions, the proliferative responsiveness
of CD4+CD45RO+ T cells from the aged was found to be comparable to young control 
cells for all stimuli tested, except anti-CD2 plus IL-7. This suggests that
signal transduction pathways involving CD2, except IL-7-mediated events, are
essentially intact in 'old' memory CD4+ T cells. On the other hand, several
cofactors, namely IL-2, IL-6, IL-7 and to a lesser extent IL-1 beta and PMA,
failed to support adequately CD2-induced activation in 'old' CD4+CD45RA+ T cells 
suggesting severe and multiple signalling deficiencies in this subset.
