CD45 is a major membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) expressed in T cells 
where it regulates the activity of Lck, a Src family kinase important for T cell 
receptor-mediated activation. PTPalpha is a more widely expressed transmembrane
PTP that has been shown to regulate the Src family kinases, Src and Fyn, and is
also present in T cells. Here, PTPalpha was phosphorylated at Tyr-789 in CD45(-) 
T cells but not in CD45(+) T cells suggesting that CD45 could regulate the
phosphorylation of PTPalpha at this site. Furthermore, CD45 could directly
dephosphorylate PTPalpha in vitro. Expression of PTPalpha and PTPalpha-Y789F in T
cells revealed that the mutant had a reduced ability to decrease Fyn and Cbp
phosphorylation, to regulate the kinase activity of Fyn, and to restore T cell
receptor-induced signaling events when compared with PTPalpha. Conversely, this
mutant had an increased ability to prevent Pyk2 phosphorylation and CD44-mediated
cell spreading when compared with PTPalpha. These data demonstrate distinct
activities of PTPalpha and PTPalpha-Y789F in T cells and identify CD45 as a
regulator of PTPalpha phosphorylation at tyrosine 789 in T cells.
