INTRODUCTION: The association between belatacept, a CD28 costimulation blocker,
and invasive mycoses is unclear.
CASE REPORT: We describe a patient who initiated belatacept 3 years after lung
transplantation and developed invasive tracheobronchial aspergillosis, a disease 
encountered almost exclusively within the first 6 months after transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: Belatacept may have played a causative role. Until more data are
available, belatacept should be used cautiously after lung transplantation.
