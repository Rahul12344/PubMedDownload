Stereochemical structure recognized by the L-fucose-specific hemagglutinin
produced by Streptomyces sp.

Kameyama T, Oishi K, Aida K.

A hemagglutinin has been purified 4000-fold from the culture filtrate of a strain
of Streptomyces by affinity chromatography. The purified preparation was judged
to be homogeneous by gel electrophoresis and its molecular weight was estimated
to be about 70 000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 
It may exhibit its full hemagglutinating activity in the monomer form. This
hemagglutinin strongly agglutinated human blood group O erythrocytes and was
inhibited by L-fucose. It was, however, distinct from the known L-fucose-specific
hemagglutinins; first, the hemagglutinating activity of the purified preparation 
was more than 100-times stronger than that of others; second, D-mannose was a
potent inhibitor of this hemagglutinin besides L-fucose but not or scarcely
inhibitory to others; and third, p-nitrophenyl-beta-L-fucoside was more
inhibitory to this hemagglutinin than p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-fucoside as opposed
to the case of others.
