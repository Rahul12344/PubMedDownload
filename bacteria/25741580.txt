BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the effects on clinical and biochemical
parameters of Lactobacillus reuteri-containing probiotic supplementation
adjunctive to initial periodontal therapy in patients with chronic periodontitis 
(CP).
METHODS: Thirty patients with CP were included and divided into two groups. Every
patient had, in each quadrant, ≥2 teeth each with approximal sites with a probing
depth (PD) of 5 to 7 mm and gingival index (GI) of ≥2. The test group received
scaling and root planing (SRP) and probiotic-containing lozenges. The control
group received SRP and placebo lozenges. Plaque index (PI), GI, bleeding on
probing (BOP), PD, and attachment gain were measured. Gingival crevicular fluid
(GCF) was sampled for the analysis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-8 and tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. All
evaluations were performed at baseline and on days 21, 90, 180, and 360.
RESULTS: Differences in intergroup comparisons of PI, GI, BOP, and PD were found 
to be significant (P <0.05) in favor of the test group at all time points.
Decreased GCF MMP-8 levels and increased TIMP-1 levels were found to be
significant up to day 180 (P <0.05). Mean values of attachment gain were
significantly higher in the test group compared with the control group on days
90, 180, and 360.
CONCLUSIONS: Lozenges containing L. reuteri may be a useful supplement in
moderately deep pockets of patients with CP. Low MMP-8 and high TIMP-1 levels may
indicate the role of the lozenges in reduction of inflammation-associated markers
up to day 180.
