A new antibacterial chlorinated benzophenone derivative, (±)-pestalachloride D
(1), along with a related analog, (±)-pestalachloride C (2), was recently
isolated from the marine-derived fungus Pestalotiopsis sp. isolated from a soft
coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from Yongxing Island in the South China Sea. Both
chiral HPLC analysis and single-crystal X-ray data indicated that 1 is a racemic 
mixture. Interestingly, 1 did not exhibit any effect in the zebrafish embryo
teratogenicity assay, while 2 led to abnormal growth. The potential impact on
zebrafish embryo growth is discussed based on their crystal structures. The main 
difference of crystal structures between 1 and 2 is that the six-member
non-aromatic ring (O4, C10, C9, C8, C2', and C3') in 1 exhibits a distorted chair
conformation, while 2 shows a distorted boat conformation. Moreover, compounds 1 
and 2 both exhibited moderate antibacterial activity.
