The release of target protein with high efficiency and low cost from expressed
fusion protein is a key requirement for commercial production of target proteins.
To establish such a cleavage system, we have designed four formic acid (FA)
cleavage sites C1 (DPDPDP), C2 (DPPDPP), C3 (DDDDPI) and C4 (IVDPNP), which was
placed in between the E and G fusion protein. Four expression vectors were
individually constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified proteins
were reacted with a series of FA concentrations or under different temperatures
followed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis to verify the degree of cleavage
efficiency. Results showed that the C2 was the most efficient site compared with 
the other three. After optimization of cleavage conditions for E-C2-G, the
cleavage efficiently could reach as high as 87.3% within 2.5 h in 37% FA at 45
Â°C. Comparing with previous reports, a significant reduction (26%) of FA
concentration at a lower temperature in a short duration of reaction (18 times
less) was achieved. We believe the cleavage site of DPPDPP identified in this
study can be used in the large-scale production of valuable fusion proteins to
save the cost, time and energy.
