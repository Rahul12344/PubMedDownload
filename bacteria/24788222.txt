BACKGROUND: Treatment with the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, was previously shown to 
protect against experimental colitis in the severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) T-cell transfer model. Here, we investigate trpv1 gene expression in
lymphoid organs and cells from SCID and BALB/c mice to identify a potential
target for the anti-inflammatory effect of capsaicin.
METHODS: The trpv1 expression was studied by real-time PCR in lymphoid tissues
and gut of untreated and capsaicin-treated colitic SCID mice. Effects of
capsaicin and a TRPV1 antagonist on T cells were studied in vitro.
RESULTS: In contrast to BALB/c mice, spleen, lymph nodes, and rectum of colitic
and noncolitic SCID mice express trpv1 mRNA. Capsaicin treatment in vivo
attenuated T-cell transfer colitis and capsaicin in vitro also attenuated T-cell 
proliferation induced by enteroantigen, mitogen, and anti-CD3/CD28 beads in
BALB/c, C57BL/6 mice, and B6.129X1-trpv1tm1Jul/J trpv1 knockout mice.
Proliferation and cytokine secretion were fully comparable in mice with and
without trpv1 expression. Likewise, enteroantigen- and mitogen-stimulated T cells
from wild-type and trpv1 knockout mice were equally inhibited by capsaicin.
Surprisingly, the TRPV1 antagonist BCTC also inhibited enteroantigen- and
mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation.
CONCLUSIONS: The trpv1 mRNA expression in lymphoid organs and the rectum of SCID 
mice suggests that the TRPV1 signaling in these organs could play a role in
capsaicin-mediated attenuation of colitis. In addition, capsaicin-induced
inhibition of T-cell proliferation of wild-type T cells lacking trpv1 expression 
suggests that capsaicin inhibits colitogenic T cells in a TRPV1
receptor-independent way, which might be linked to its anti-inflammatory effect.
