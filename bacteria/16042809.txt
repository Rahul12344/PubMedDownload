BACKGROUND: It has been reported that some persons with hemochromatosis have low 
total blood lymphocyte counts, but the reason for this is unknown.
METHODS: We measured total blood lymphocyte counts using an automated blood cell 
counter in 146 hemochromatosis probands (88 men, 58 women) with HFE C282Y
homozygosity who were diagnosed in medical care. Univariate and multivariate
analyses of total blood lymphocyte counts were evaluated using these variables:
sex; age, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin concentration at diagnosis; 
units of blood removed by phlebotomy to achieve iron depletion; and human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B alleles and haplotypes.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 49 +/- 14 years (range 18 - 80 years) in
men and 50 +/- 13 years (range 22-88 years) in women. The correlations of total
blood lymphocyte counts with sex, age, transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin
concentration at diagnosis, and units of blood removed by phlebotomy to achieve
iron depletion were not significant at the 0.05 level. Univariate analyses
revealed significant associations between total blood lymphocyte counts and
presence of the HLA-A*01, -B*08, and -B*14 alleles, and the A*01-B*08 haplotype. 
Presence of the A*01 allele, B*08 allele, or A*01-B*08 haplotype were associated 
with a lower total blood lymphocyte count, whereas presence of the B*14 allele
was associated with a greater total blood lymphocyte count. There was an inverse 
association of total blood lymphocyte count with units of phlebotomy to achieve
iron depletion, serum ferritin concentration, and with presence of the A*01-B*08 
haplotype.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that there is a significant inverse relationship of total
blood lymphocyte counts and severity of iron overload in hemochromatosis probands
with HFE C282Y homozygosity. The presence of the HLA-A*01 allele or the -B*08
allele was also associated with significantly lower total blood lymphocyte
counts, whereas presence of the -B*14 allele was associated with significantly
higher total blood lymphocyte counts. In univariate and multivariate analyses,
total blood lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in probands with the
HLA-A*01-B*08 haplotype than in probands without this haplotype.
