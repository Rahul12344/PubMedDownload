Despite their broad anti-infective utility, the biosynthesis of the paradigm
carbapenem antibiotic, thienamycin, remains largely unknown. Apart from the first
two steps shared with a simple carbapenem, the pathway sharply diverges to the
more structurally complex members of this class of Î²-lactam antibiotics, such as 
thienamycin. Existing evidence points to three putative cobalamin-dependent
radical S-adenosylmethionine (RS) enzymes, ThnK, ThnL, and ThnP, as potentially
being responsible for assembly of the ethyl side chain at C6, bridgehead
epimerization at C5, installation of the C2-thioether side chain, and C2/3
desaturation. The C2 substituent has been demonstrated to be derived by stepwise 
truncation of CoA, but the timing of these events with respect to C2-S bond
formation is not known. We show that ThnK of the three apparent
cobalamin-dependent RS enzymes performs sequential methylations to build out the 
C6-ethyl side chain in a stereocontrolled manner. This enzymatic reaction was
found to produce expected RS methylase coproducts S-adenosylhomocysteine and
5'-deoxyadenosine, and to require cobalamin. For double methylation to occur, the
carbapenam substrate must bear a CoA-derived C2-thioether side chain, implying
the activity of a previous sulfur insertion by an as-yet unidentified enzyme.
These insights allow refinement of the central steps in complex carbapenem
biosynthesis.
