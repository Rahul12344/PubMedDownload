The DEAH-box helicase Prp43 is a key player in pre-mRNA splicing as well as the
maturation of rRNAs. The exact modus operandi of Prp43 and of all other
spliceosomal DEAH-box RNA helicases is still elusive. Here, we report crystal
structures of Prp43 complexes in different functional states and the analysis of 
structure-based mutants providing insights into the unwinding and loading
mechanism of RNAs. The Prp43•ATP-analog•RNA complex shows the localization of the
RNA inside a tunnel formed by the two RecA-like and C-terminal domains. In the
ATP-bound state this tunnel can be transformed into a groove prone for RNA
binding by large rearrangements of the C-terminal domains. Several conformational
changes between the ATP- and ADP-bound states explain the coupling of ATP
hydrolysis to RNA translocation, mainly mediated by a β-turn of the RecA1 domain 
containing the newly identified RF motif. This mechanism is clearly different to 
those of other RNA helicases.
