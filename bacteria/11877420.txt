beta-Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane protein 
of unknown function that is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. 
The cytoplasmic tail of APP interacts with phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain
containing proteins (Fe65, X11, mDab-1, and JIP-1) and may modulate gene
expression and apoptosis. We now identify Shc A and Shc C, PTB-containing adapter
proteins that signal to cellular differentiation and survival pathways, as novel 
APP-interacting proteins. The APP cytoplasmic tail contains a PTB-binding motif
(Y(682)ENPTY(687)) that, when phosphorylated on Tyr(682), precipitated the PTB
domain of Shc A and Shc C, as well as endogenous full-length Shc A. APP and Shc C
were physically associated in adult mouse brain homogenates. Increase in
phosphorylation of APP by overexpression of the nerve growth factor receptor Trk 
A in 293T cells promoted the interaction of transfected APP and endogenous Shc A.
Pervanadate treatment of N2a neuroblastoma cells resulted in tyrosine
phosphorylation and association of endogenous APP and Shc A. Thus, APP and Shc
proteins interact in vitro, in cells, and in the mouse brain. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of APP may promote the interaction with Shc proteins.
