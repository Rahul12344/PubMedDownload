AIMS: Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, represents the
leading cause of death in critically ill patients. However, the pathogenesis of
sepsis remains incompletely understood. Carbon monoxide (CO), when administered
at low physiologic doses, can modulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and
inflammation in pre-clinical tissue injury models, though its mechanism of action
in sepsis remains unclear.
RESULTS: CO (250â€‰ppm) inhalation increased the survival of C57BL/6J mice injured 
by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) through the induction of autophagy, the
down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and by decreasing the levels of
bacteria in blood and vital organs, such as the lung and liver. Mice deficient in
the autophagic protein, Beclin 1 (Becn1(+/-)) were more susceptible to
CLP-induced sepsis, and unresponsive to CO therapy, relative to their
corresponding wild-type (Becn1(+/+)) littermate mice. In contrast, mice deficient
in autophagic protein microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3B (LC3B)
(Map1lc3b(-/-)) and their corresponding wild-type (Map1lc3b(+/+)) mice showed no 
differences in survival or response to CO, during CLP-induced sepsis. CO enhanced
bacterial phagocytosis in Becn1(+/+) but not Becn1(+/-) mice in vivo and in
corresponding cultured macrophages. CO also enhanced Beclin 1-dependent induction
of macrophage protein signaling lymphocyte-activation molecule, a regulator of
phagocytosis.
INNOVATION: Our findings demonstrate a novel protective effect of CO in sepsis,
dependent on autophagy protein Beclin 1, in a murine model of CLP-induced
polymicrobial sepsis.
CONCLUSION: CO increases the survival of mice injured by CLP through systemic
enhancement of autophagy and phagocytosis. Taken together, we suggest that CO gas
may represent a novel therapy for patients with sepsis.
