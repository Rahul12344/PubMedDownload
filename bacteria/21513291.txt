In the course of our search for novel secondary metabolites, the CHCl3-MeOH
extract of the novel myxobacterial strain Sorangiineae SBNa008 was shown to be
active against human SW480 colon adinocarcinoma cells. Bioassay-guided
fractionation of the extract yielded a highly conjugated novel, sterol
9α,11α-dihydroxyergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one, 1. The structure and the
relative stereochemistry of 1 were established from interpretation of
spectroscopic data and X-ray crystallography.
