Platelet-activating factor (PAF), a glycerophospholipid with proinflammatory
properties, exerts its biological effects by interacting with the PAF receptor
(PAFR) expressed on many different cell types. The PAFR specifically binds
phosphorylcholine, the biologically active component of PAF. However,
phosphorylcholine is also a component of the cell wall of nontypeable Haemophilus
influenzae (NTHi). In recently published in vitro experiments, the invasion of
respiratory epithelial cells by NTHi was mediated by the PAFR. To determine the
role of the PAFR in host defense against pneumonia induced by NTHi,
PAFR-deficient (PAFR-/-) and normal wild-type mice were intranasally inoculated
with NTHi. The absence of a functional PAFR was associated with a normal innate
immune response as indicated by similar bacterial counts, myeloperoxidase
activity, and inflammation within the pulmonary compartment of PAFR-/- and
wild-type mice. These data indicate that the PAFR does not interfere with the
clearance of NTHi from the respiratory tract.
