PURPOSE: In cases of septic knee arthritis, there is excess of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) over tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs),
due to enhanced expression and activation that are induced by bacteria in
comparison with rheumatic or degenerative arthritis. The aim of this study was to
explore the expression levels of synovial gelatinase MMP-9 and its specific
inhibitor TIMP-1 in septic and aseptic arthritis and their potential use as
additional aids to clinical investigation.
METHODS: Gelatin zymography and western blot analysis were applied in effusions
from knees of the patients with septic (SA-10 patients), rheumatic (RA-10
patients) and osteoarthritis (OA-10 patients).
RESULTS: Zymographic analysis revealed that all samples contained latent MMP-2
activity, albeit activated MMP-2 appeared in more of the septic than aseptic
effusions. MMP-9 was not detected in osteoarthritic synovial fluid samples. Only 
trace amounts of MMP-9 activity were detected in 4 of 10 patients with RA,
whereas higher MMP-9 levels were evident in all samples from SA (P = 0.0241). In 
immunoblotting assays, samples from SA showed significantly higher levels of
MMP-9 compared with samples from RA (P = 0.0052), confirming zymographic results.
Although no significant difference in TIMP-1 levels was observed, the estimated
MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio of septic effusions was significantly higher compared with
aseptic ones (P = 0.0029).
CONCLUSIONS: The data presented suggest enhanced expression and activation of
MMP-9 in septic native knee arthritis compared with aseptic. The presence of high
levels of MMP-9 with concomitantly increased MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio and activated
gelatinases in effusions, independent of neutrophilic counts, may be indicative
for infection.
