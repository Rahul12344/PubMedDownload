A new linear polyketide, juniperolide A (1), was produced by the terrestrial
actinomycete (Lv1-48) isolated from the rhizosphere of the plant Juniperus
excelsa. The juniperolide A (1) structure contains a THP unit and a
3-amino-2,3,6-trideoxyhexose as the glycosidic moiety. Mosher's analysis was used
for absolute stereochemistry determinations at C-2, C-8, C-20, and C-4', while
the relative stereochemistry assignments of the remaining stereocenters were
based on ROESY correlations and J-based coupling.
