The hyperthermophilic endoglucanase Cel5A from Thermotoga maritima can find
applications in lignocellulosic biofuel production, because it catalyzes the
hydrolysis of glucan- and mannan-based polysaccharides. Here, we report the
crystal structures in apo-form and in complex with three ligands, cellotetraose, 
cellobiose and mannotriose, at 1.29Å to 2.40Å resolution. The open
carbohydrate-binding cavity which can accommodate oligosaccharide substrates with
extensively branched chains explained the dual specificity of the enzyme.
Combining our structural information and the previous kinetic data, it is
suggested that this enzyme prefers β-glucosyl and β-mannosyl moieties at the
reducing end and uses two conserved catalytic residues, E253 (nucleophile) and
E136 (general acid/base), to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds. Moreover, our
results also suggest that the wide spectrum of Tm_Cel5A substrates might be due
to the lack of steric hindrance around the C2-hydroxyl group of the glucose or
mannose unit from active-site residues.
