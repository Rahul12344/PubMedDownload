The apical surface of the terminally differentiated mammalian urothelial umbrella
cell is mechanically stable and highly impermeable, in part due to its coverage
by urothelial plaques consisting of 2D crystals of uroplakin particles. The
mechanism for regulating the uroplakin/plaque level is unclear. We found that
genetic ablation of the highly tissue-specific sorting nexin Snx31, which
localizes to plaques lining the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in urothelial
umbrella cells, abolishes MVBs suggesting that Snx31 plays a role in stabilizing 
the MVB-associated plaques by allowing them to achieve a greater curvature.
Strikingly, Snx31 ablation also induces a massive accumulation of
uroplakin-containing mitochondria-derived lipid droplets (LDs), which mediate
uroplakin degradation via autophagy/lipophagy, leading to the loss of apical and 
fusiform vesicle plaques. These results suggest that MVBs play an active role in 
suppressing the excessive/wasteful endocytic degradation of uroplakins. Failure
of this suppression mechanism triggers the formation of mitochondrial LDs so that
excessive uroplakin membranes can be sequestered and degraded. Because
mitochondrial LD formation, which occurs at a low level in normal urothelium, can
also be induced by disturbance in uroplakin polymerization due to individual
uroplakin knockout and by arsenite, a bladder carcinogen, this pathway may
represent an inducible, versatile urothelial detoxification mechanism.
