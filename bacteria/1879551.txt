Internal deletions of the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) cDNA have been generated in 
the region encoding residues 29 to 42. Mutant proteins were produced by in vitro 
transcription-translation or in Escherichia coli and tested for their biological 
activity using the hybridoma growth factor (HGF) assay or a transcriptional
activation assay on human hepatoma cells. The folding of the mutants was also
checked by immunoprecipitation with conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. 
The results show that only residues 29 to 34 are crucial for IL-6 activity and
that the first two amino acids are probably involved in the definition of the
IL-6 active site.
