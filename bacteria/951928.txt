Kasabov R, Nachev S.

An enzootic of necrotic dermatosis in hen layers was described. The changes
consisted in that they had constant localization and demarkated sites on the skin
between the back and the neck. The disease was observed on a farm for 5000 layers
in the course of two consecutive years. All birds contracted the disease and in
the first year they recovered the 10 months; in second year they recovered for
three months. Each bird showed symptoms for 3 weeks. The skin lesions resulted in
cicatrization. The etiologic agent (a Pasteurella-like organism) was isolated
from the necrotic foci. It proved pathogenic for albino mice and manifested
biochemical activity and morphology characteristic of Pasteurella multocida. The 
disease was successfully reproduced with a broth culture applied on a scarified
skin of test birds. Histopathologically, the spontaneous lesions proved
undistinguishable from the experimental ones and represented coagulation necrosis
of the epidermis, derm, and subcutis. It is supposed that the constant
localization was due to the porte d'entrer of the infection, associated with the 
bad habit of picage on the neck as demonstrated on a large scale by the birds of 
the infected flock. This is characteristic of some lines of the White Leghorn
breed.
