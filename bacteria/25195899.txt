Elongation factor P (EF-P) plays an essential role in the translation of
polyproline-containing proteins in bacteria. It becomes functional by the
post-translational modification of its highly conserved lysine residue. It is
first β-lysylated by PoxA and then hydroxylated by YfcM. In this work, the YfcM
protein from Escherichia coli was overexpressed, purified and crystallized. The
crystal of YfcM was obtained by the in situ proteolysis crystallization method
and diffracted X-rays to 1.45 Å resolution. It belonged to space group C2, with
unit-cell parameters a = 124.4, b = 37.0, c = 37.6 Å, β = 101.2°. The calculated 
Matthews coefficient (VM) of the crystal was 1.91 Å(3) Da(-1), indicating that
one YfcM molecule is present in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of
35.7%.
