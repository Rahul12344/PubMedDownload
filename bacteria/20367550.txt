Escherichia coli enterotoxigenic strains produce one or more toxins which action 
result in production of diarrhea in animals including Man. One of these toxins,
STb, has been mainly associated with colibacillosis in swine. Although highly
prevalent in pigs with diarrhea, a relation between STb and disease was arduous
to establish. With the recent recognition of a new adhesin, originally found in
human E. coli isolates, named AIDA (adhesin involved in diffuse adherence) and
its association with new E. coli pathotypes to which STb is linked, new light was
shed on STb toxic potency. In this review, the association of STb and AIDA is
examined according to the recent knowledge gained with newly described E. coli
pathotypes.
