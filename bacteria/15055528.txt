We investigated whether stem cells (MDSC) from primary cultures of rat skeletal
muscle can differentiate into the smooth muscle lineage in response to vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and coculture with bladder smooth muscle cells. 
The MDSC were isolated from gastrocnemius muscle biopsies of normal 3-6 week-old 
Sprague-Dawley rats and purified by the preplate technique. Cells that took
approximately 6 days to adhere to the collagen-coated flasks were termed late
preplate (LP) cells, and were used in all the experiments. The early plate (EP)
cells (pp1-pp4) contained some myogenic cells but were mostly fibroblasts (< 15% 
desmin+ cells) whereas the LP cells (pp5-pp6) were highly purified muscle-derived
cells (pp6) (> 90% desmin+ cells). The muscle-derived stem cells (LP cells) were 
CD34+ or Sca-1+, CD45- and desmin+ by immunohistochemical staining. After two
days of co-culture with bladder smooth muscle cells, about 25% of the
muscle-derived stem cells were positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin
(alpha-SMA)+. RT-PCR for alpha-SMA was positive in the VEGF stimulated MDSC, but 
negative in the absence of VEGF. In conclusion, rat muscle-derived stem cells
exhibited stem cell properties (CD34+ or Sca-1+), and were not of hematogeous
(CD45-) but of myogenic origin (desmin+). RT-PCR of alpha-SMA was positive in the
VEGF stimulated muscle-derived stem cells.
