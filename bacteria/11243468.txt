Human acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs) are associated with chromosomal
translocations that replace the NH2 terminus of wild-type retinoic acid receptor 
(RAR) alpha with portions of the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) or
promyelocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (PLZF). The wild-type RARalpha readily
forms heterodimers with the retinoid X receptors (RXRs), and these RAR/RXR
heterodimers appear to be the principal mediators of retinoid signaling in normal
cells. In contrast, PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARa display an enhanced ability to
form homodimers, and this enhanced homodimer formation is believed to contribute 
to the neoplastic properties of these chimeric oncoproteins. We report here that 
the DNA recognition specificity of the RXRalpha/RARa heterodimer, which is
presumed to be the dominant receptor species in normal cells, differs from that
of the PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha homodimers, which are thought to prevail in
the oncogenic cell. We suggest that differences in target gene recognition by the
normal and oncogenic RARalpha proteins may contribute to the leukemogenic
phenotype.
