OBJECTIVES: The mechanism of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue
inhibitors (TIMPs) in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) is unclear. The purpose of this
study was to describe changes in MMP-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 levels during DFU
healing, and to search for any correlation in the changes in MMP levels with
wound healing, in order to find possible predictors of healing.
METHODS: Patients with a DFU were recruited and placed into two groups, according
to the degree of wound healing: 'good healers' and 'poor healers'. Levels of
MMP-1, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 were analysed by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay).
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients participated in the study. The MMP-1 level was
significantly higher at weeks zero (W0) and 12 (W12) in 'good healers' than in
'poor healers' (p=0.045 and 0.008, respectively). In contrast, the MMP-9 level
was significantly lower in 'good healers' than in 'poor healers' at W0, W4, and
W12 (p=0.001, 0.001 and 0.028, respectively). Receiver operator curve (ROC)
analysis of the MMP-9 level, MMP-1/TIMP-1 ratio, and MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio at W0
provided cut-off levels of 0.38, 0.056, and 9.06, respectively, which were best
predictive of a reduction in wound area at W4 ('good healers' versus 'poor
healers'; thereby predicting wound healing condition at W12) with a sensitivity
of 81.8%, 81.8%, and 90.9%, and a specificity of 64.6%, 55%, and 64.6%,
respectively.
CONCLUSION: A 'poor healing scoring system' is therefore proposed that could be
determined on patient admission, which has the potential to be used clinically as
a predictor of healing, thus allowing an appropriate treatment plan to be
developed.
