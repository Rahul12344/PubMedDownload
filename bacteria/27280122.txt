Natural killer T (NKT) cells bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune
system, and manipulating their effector functions can have therapeutic
significances in the treatment of autoimmunity, transplant biology, infectious
disease and cancer. This important lymphocyte subset regulates the immune system 
through their potent cytokine production following the recognition of lipid
antigen present in the context of the MHC class I-like CD1d molecule, in addition
their ability to directly mediate cytotoxicity. Here, we describe a method of
expanding mouse invariant NKT (iNKT) cell lines from mononuclear cells isolated
from the thymus, spleen, or liver using bone marrow derived dendritic cells.
These iNKT cell lines can be used study their co-signaling requirements, cytokine
profiles and cytotoxic functions which will greatly enhance our knowledge of iNKT
cell biology.
