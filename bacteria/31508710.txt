OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to formulate experimental orthodontic 
bracket adhesives and test their mechanical properties, fluoride release and
antibacterial activity.
METHODS: Four experimental antibacterial orthodontic bracket adhesives were
prepared with different compositions of synthesized antibacterial monomers
replacing total 5% of dental monomers in the control Transbond XT (3M): 5%C11,
3.5%C11+1.5%C2, 5%C16, and 3.5%C16+1.5%C2. Transbond XT alone was used as
control. These groups were used to bond premolar brackets to extracted premolars.
Shear bond strength (SBS) was tested using an Instron machine. For antibacterial 
test, disk specimens (10mm diameter, 1mm thick, n=4) were fabricated and
incubated with cultures of cariogenic Streptococcus mutans for 48h, and following
gentle sonication, S. mutans biofilms in colony-forming-units (CFU) on the disks 
were enumerated by plating on agar medium. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and
Tukey test (Î±=0.05).
RESULTS: All experimental groups had similar shear bond strength (no significant 
difference) to the control. All experimental groups showed significant inhibitory
effect against S. mutans biofilm formation, when compared to the control, but
there was no significant difference between experimental groups.
CONCLUSION: Antibacterial orthodontic adhesive can be fabricated to have similar 
mechanical properties but better caries-inhibitory effect than current adhesive.
