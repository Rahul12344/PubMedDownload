BACKGROUND & AIMS: Loss of claudin 18 (CLDN18), a membrane-spanning tight
junction protein, occurs during early stages of development of gastric cancer and
associates with shorter survival times of patients. We investigated whether loss 
of CLDN18 occurs in mice that develop intraepithelial neoplasia with invasive
glands due to infection with Helicobacter pylori, and whether loss is sufficient 
to promote the development of similar lesions in mice with or without H pylori
infection.
METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical analyses in levels of CLDN18 in
archived tissues from B6:129 mice infected with H pylori for 6 to 15 months. We
analyzed gastric tissues from B6:129S5-Cldn18tm1Lex/Mmucd mice, in which the
CLDN18 gene was disrupted in gastric tissues (CLDN18-knockout mice), or from
control mice with a full-length CLDN18 gene (CLDN18+/+; B6:129S5/SvEvBrd) or
heterozygous disruption of CLDN18 (CLDN18+/-; B6:129S5/SvEvBrd) that were
infected with H pylori SS1 or PMSS1 at 6 weeks of age and tissues collected for
analysis at 20 and 30 weeks after infection. Tissues from CLDN18-knockout mice
and control mice with full-length CLDN18 gene expression were also analyzed
without infection at 7 weeks and 2 years after birth. Tissues from control and
CLDN18-knockout mice were analyzed by electron microscopy, stained by
conventional methods and analyzed for histopathology, prepared by laser capture
microdissection and analyzed by RNAseq, and immunostained for lineage markers,
proliferation markers, and stem cell markers and analyzed by super-resolution or 
conventional confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: CLDN18 had a basolateral rather than apical tight junction localization 
in gastric epithelial cells. B6:129 mice infected with H pylori, which developed 
intraepithelial neoplasia with invasive glands, had increasing levels of CLDN18
loss over time compared with uninfected mice. In B6:129 mice infected with H
pylori compared with uninfected mice, CLDN18 was first lost from most gastric
glands followed by disrupted and reduced expression in the gastric neck and in
surface cells. Gastric tissues from CLDN18-knockout mice had low levels of
inflammation but increased cell proliferation, expressed markers of
intestinalized proliferative spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia, and
had defects in signal transduction pathways including p53 and STAT signaling by 7
weeks after birth compared with full-length CLDN18 gene control mice. By 20 to 30
weeks after birth, gastric tissues from uninfected CLDN18-knockout mice developed
intraepithelial neoplasia that invaded the submucosa; by 2 years, gastric tissues
contained large and focally dysplastic polypoid tumors with invasive glands that 
invaded the serosa.
CONCLUSIONS: H pylori infection of B6:129 mice reduced the expression of CLDN18
early in gastric cancer progression, similar to previous observations from human 
gastric tissues. CLDN18 regulates cell lineage differentiation and cellular
signaling in mouse stomach; CLDN18-knockout mice develop intraepithelial
neoplasia and then large and focally dysplastic polypoid tumors in the absence of
H pylori infection.
