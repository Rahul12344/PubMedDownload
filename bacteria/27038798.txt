BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians account for the majority of antibiotic
prescribing in ambulatory care in Germany. Respiratory diseases are, regardless
of effectiveness, often treated with antibiotics. Research has found this use
without indication to be caused largely by communication problems (e.g.
expectations on the patient's part or false assumptions about them by the
physician). The present randomised controlled trial (RCT) study evaluates whether
communication training for primary care physicians can reduce the antibiotic
prescribing rate for respiratory tract infections.
METHODS/DESIGN: The study consists of three groups: group A will receive
communication training; group B will be given the same, plus additional, access
to an evidence-based point-of-care tool; and group C will function as the control
group. The primary endpoint is the difference between intervention and control
groups regarding the antibiotic prescribing rate before and after the
intervention assessed through routine data. The communication skills are captured
with the help of the communication instrument MAAS-Global-D, as well as
individual videos of physician-patient consultations recorded by the primary care
physicians. These skills will also be regarded with respect to the antibiotic
prescribing rate. A process evaluation using qualitative as well as quantitative 
methods should provide information about barriers and enablers to implementing
the communication training.
DISCUSSION: The trial contributes to an insight into the effectiveness of the
different components to reduce antibiotic prescribing, which will also be
supported by an extensive evaluation. Communication training could be an
effective method of reducing antibiotic prescribing in primary care.
