AIMS: To isolate highly effective aerobic As(V)-reducing bacteria from
arsenic(As)-contaminated soils in Northwest China and to identify their dynamic
As(V) reduction processes and genomic detoxification mechanisms.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Enrichment cultures were performed aerobically in tryptone, 
yeast extract and glucose medium in the presence of As(V). Strain SXB isolated
from soil in Shanxi Province, belonging to Bacillus genus, reduced As(V) more
effectively under aerobic conditions than under anaerobic conditions. Strain IMH,
a strictly aerobic isolate obtained from soil in Inner Mongolia, identified as
Pantoea, is reported for the first time to reduce As(V). Both isolates could
reduce over 90% As(V) in 36 h under aerobic conditions. Putative gene fragments
for the ArsB efflux pump gene were obtained from both strains. The putative
arsenate reductase gene was only amplified from strain SXB. A putative arsH gene 
was amplified from strain IMH.
CONCLUSIONS: Strains SXB and IMH isolated from the As-contaminated soils reduce
As(V) effectively under aerobic conditions via a detoxification mechanism
regulated by ars operons.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Pantoea genus is reported to reduce As(V)
for the first time. This study provides a full understanding of the highly
effective As(V)-reducing bacteria SXB and IMH, which could influence the As
biogeochemical cycle in soils.
