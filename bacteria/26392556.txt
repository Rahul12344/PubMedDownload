Successful induction of B-cell activation and memory depends on help from CD4+ T 
cells. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells (glycolipid-specific,
CD1d-restricted innate lymphocytes) provide both cognate (direct) and noncognate 
(indirect) helper signals to enhance B-cell responses. Both forms of iNKT-cell
help induce primary humoral immune responses, but only noncognate iNKT-cell help 
drives humoral memory and plasma cells. Here, we show that iNKT cognate help for 
B cells is fundamentally different from the help provided by conventional CD4+ T 
cells. Cognate iNKT-cell help drives an early, unsustained germinal center B-cell
expansion, less reduction of T follicular regulatory cells, an expansion of
marginal zone B cells, and early increases in regulatory IL-10-producing B-cell
numbers compared with noncognate activation. These results are consistent with a 
mechanism whereby iNKT cells preferentially provide an innate form of help that
does not generate humoral memory and has important implications for the
application of glycolipid molecules as vaccine adjuvants.
