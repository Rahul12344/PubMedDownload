Within an individual, six different HLA class II heterodimers are expressed
co-dominantly by two alleles of HLA-DR, -DQ, and -DP loci. However, it remained
unclear which HLA allotypes were used in T cell responses to a given antigen. For
the measurement of the CD4+ T cell responses restricted by a single HLA allotype,
we established a panel of artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing 
each single HLA allele of 20 HLA-DRB1, 16 HLA-DQ, and 13 HLA-DP alleles. CD4+ T
cell responses to cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65 restricted by single HLA class II
allotype defined in 45 healthy donors. The average magnitude of CD4+ T cell
responses by HLA-DR allotypes was higher than HLA-DQ and HLA-DP allotypes. CD4+ T
cell responses by DRA*01:01/DRB1*04:06, DQA1*01:02/DQB1*06:02,
DPA1*02:02/DPB1*05:01 were higher among the other alleles in each HLA-DR, -DQ,
and -DP locus. Interestingly, the frequencies of HLA-DR alleles and the
positivity of specific allotypes showed an inverse correlation. One allotype
within individuals is dominantly used in CD4+ T cell response in 49% of donors,
and two allotypes showed that in 7% of donors, and any positive response was
detected in 44% of donors. Even if one individual had several dominant alleles,
CD4+ T cell responses tended to be restricted by only one of them. Furthermore,
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses by HLA class I and class II were correlated. Our
results demonstrate that the CD4+ T cell preferentially use a few dominant HLA
class II allotypes within individuals, similar to CD8+ T cell response to CMV
pp65.
