Membrane-anchored mucins are present in the apical surface glycocalyx of mucosal 
epithelial cells, each mucosal epithelium having at least two of the mucins. The 
mucins have been ascribed barrier functions, but direct comparisons of their
functions within the same epithelium have not been done. In an epithelial cell
line that expresses the membrane-anchored mucins, MUC1 and MUC16, the mucins were
independently and stably knocked down using shRNA. Barrier functions tested
included dye penetrance, bacterial adherence and invasion, transepithelial
resistance, tight junction formation, and apical surface size. Knockdown of MUC16
decreased all barrier functions tested, causing increased dye penetrance and
bacterial invasion, decreased transepithelial resistance, surprisingly,
disruption of tight junctions, and greater apical surface cell area. Knockdown of
MUC1 did not decrease barrier function, in fact, barrier to dye penetrance and
bacterial invasion increased significantly. These data suggest that barrier
functions of membrane-anchored mucins vary in the context of other membrane
mucins, and MUC16 provides a major barrier when present.
