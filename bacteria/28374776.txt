Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induces cell migration and scattering by
mechanisms that are thought to tip a local balance of competing physical forces; 
cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate forces. In this local process, HGF is known to
attenuate local cadherin-dependent adhesion forces for cell-cell junction
development and enhance local integrin-dependent contractile forces for pulling
neighboring cells apart. Here we use an expanding island of confluent Madin-Darby
canine kidney (MDCK) cells as a model system to quantify the collective cell
migration. In the absence of HGF, cell trajectories are highly tortuous whereas
in the presence of HGF, they become far less so, resembling free expansion of a
gas. At the level of cell-to-cell junctions, HGF attenuates the linkage of stress
fibers to cell-to-cell junctions with concomitant decrease in intercellular
stress. At the level of cell-to-substrate junctions, HGF augments the linkage of 
stress fibers to cell-to-substrate junctions with no apparent effect on traction.
Together, HGF induces both structural changes in the actin-bound junctional
protein complex and physical forces spanning multicellular clusters, which
further promotes the expansion of confluent cellular layer.
