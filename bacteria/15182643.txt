AIM: To express HLA-A2 heavy chain (HC) and light chain beta(2m) in bacteria and 
to prepare soluble HLA-A2-peptide complex.
METHODS: HC and beta(2m) expressing engineering bacteria was induced for 5 h with
0.5 mmol/L IPTG. After sonification of the bacteria,crude inclusion body was
obtained which was then refined, renaturated, ultrafiltrated, and purified by
DEAE Sepherose Fast Flow anion exchange chromatography. Then HC and beta(2m) were
connected with two specific peptides, purified through Superdex 75 gel
filtration, and identified with mAb W6/32 which can recognize native HLA-A2.
RESULTS: The expression rates of HC and beta(2m) in engineering bacteria was both
about 50%. The purity of both expression products reached to 95%.Moreover, the
two HLA-A2-peptide complexes could be recognized by mAb W6/32, even after being
stored at 4 degrees Celsius for 2 months.
CONCLUSION: The two soluble HLA-A2-peptide complexes prepared by us are stable
and lay the foundation for further research of CTL recognition and response.
