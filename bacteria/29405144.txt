PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes in
major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) by using online
software and also to analyse the secondary structure of MOMP through
bioinformatics tools.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The predictions of secondary structure of MOMP protein
were carried out using SOPMA software, and the prediction of B-cell epitopes in
MOMP protein was carried out using IEDB and LEPS software, while the T-cell
epitopes were predicted by the software of IEBD and SYFPEITHI. The predictions
from the software were combined with MOMP protein characteristics, including
surface features, hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility and plasticity, to
analyse the common epitope areas' response by T-cells and B-cells.
RESULTS: In the secondary structure of CT MOMP, the alpha-helices accounted for
41.62% of total amino acid, while the beta sheets and random coil accounted for
19.80% and 32.49%, respectively. Predictions combined with MOMP protein surface
features, hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility and plasticity were further 
characterised, and three high-score B-cell epitope areas were found as located in
24-31, 307-311 and 318-327 amino acids of MOMP protein, respectively; in the
meanwhile, three high-score T-cell epitope areas were found in 234-236, 323-329
and 338-343 amino acids of MOMP using major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I HLA-A 0201 restrictive T-cell epitope analyser.
CONCLUSION: We established the methods by using the biological information
network technologies for looking the T-cell antigen epitopes and B-cell antigen
epitopes in MOMP of CT, and three novel T-cell epitopes as well as three novel
B-cell epitopes were identified in the current study. It provides important
information for further studying the antigenicity of CT MOMP protein and also
provides useful information for developing highly efficient subunit vaccines for 
CT.
