Routine application of antimicrobials is the current treatment of choice for
rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS) or bacterial coldwater disease (BCWD) caused by
Flavobacterium psychrophilum. In this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities
of 133 F. psychrophilum isolates, 118 of which were from the UK, were evaluated
by broth microdilution and disc diffusion methods following VET04-A2 and VET03-A 
guidelines of Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI), respectively.
Isolates were categorized as wild type (fully susceptible, WT) or non-wild type
(NWT) using normalized resistance interpretation (NRI)-determined cut-off values 
(COWT ). Broth microdilution testing showed that only 12% of UK isolates were WT 
to oxolinic acid (MIC COWT  ≤ 0.25 mg/L) and 42% were WT for oxytetracycline (MIC
COWT  ≤ 0.25 mg/L). In contrast, all the isolates tested were WT (MIC COWT
 ≤ 2 mg/L) for florfenicol, the main antimicrobial for RTFS control in the UK.
Disc diffusion-based COWT values were ≥51 mm for 10 μg amoxicillin, ≥44 mm for
30 μg florfenicol, ≥30 mm for 2 μg oxolinic acid and ≥51 mm for 30 μg
oxytetracycline. There was a high categorical agreement between the
classifications of the isolates by two testing methods for florfenicol (100%),
oxytetracycline (93%) and oxolinic acid (99%).
