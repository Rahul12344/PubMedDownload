Bioequivalence studies are the pivotal clinical trials submitted to regulatory
agencies to support the marketing applications of generic drug products. Average 
bioequivalence (ABE) is used to determine whether the mean values for the
pharmacokinetic measures determined after administration of the test and
reference products are comparable. Two-stage 2×2 crossover adaptive designs
(TSDs) are becoming increasingly popular because they allow making assumptions on
the clinically meaningful treatment effect and a reliable guess for the unknown
within-subject variability. At an interim look, if ABE is not declared with an
initial sample size, they allow to increase it depending on the estimated
variability and to enroll additional subjects at a second stage, or to stop for
futility in case of poor likelihood of bioequivalence. This is crucial because
both parameters must clearly be prespecified in protocols, and the strategy
agreed with regulatory agencies in advance with emphasis on controlling the
overall type I error. We present an iterative method to adjust the significance
levels at each stage which preserves the overall type I error for a wide set of
scenarios which should include the true unknown variability value. Simulations
showed adjusted significance levels higher than 0.0300 in most cases with type I 
error always below 5%, and with a power of at least 80%. TSDs work particularly
well for coefficients of variation below 0.3 which are especially useful due to
the balance between the power and the percentage of studies proceeding to stage
2. Our approach might support discussions with regulatory agencies.
