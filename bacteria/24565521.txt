The purification of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) from human adipose 
tissue cells (stromal vascular fraction) was investigated using membrane
filtration through poly(lactide-co-glycolic acid)/silk screen hybrid membranes.
Membrane filtration methods are attractive in regenerative medicine because they 
reduce the time required to purify hADSCs (i.e., less than 30 min) compared with 
conventional culture methods, which require 5-12 days. hADSCs expressing the
mesenchymal stem cell markers CD44, CD73, and CD90 were concentrated in the
permeation solution from the hybrid membranes. Expression of the surface markers 
CD44, CD73, and CD99 on the cells in the permeation solution from the hybrid
membranes, which were obtained using 18 mL of feed solution containing 50 × 10⁴
cells, was statistically significantly higher than that of the primary adipose
tissue cells, indicating that the hADSCs can be purified in the permeation
solution by the membrane filtration method. Cells expressing the stem
cell-associated marker CD34 could be successfully isolated in the permeation
solution, whereas CD34⁺ cells could not be purified by the conventional culture
method. The hADSCs in the permeation solution demonstrated a superior capacity
for osteogenic differentiation based on their alkali phosphatase activity, their 
osterix gene expression, and the results of mineralization analysis by Alizarin
Red S and von Kossa staining compared with the cells from the suspension of human
adipose tissue. These results suggest that the hADSCs capable of osteogenic
differentiation preferentially permeate through the hybrid membranes.
