The role of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene A
(MICA), a ligand of NKG2D, has been defined in human diseases by its allele
associations with various autoimmune diseases, hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) and cancer. This study describes a practical system to
develop MICA genotyping by allele-specific primer extension (ASPE) on
microarrays. From the results of 20 control primers, strict and reliable cut-off 
values of more than 30,000 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as positive and less
than 3000 MFI as negative, were applied to select high-quality specific extension
primers. Among 55 allele-specific primers, 44 primers could be initially selected
as optimal primer. Through adjusting the length, six primers were improved. The
other failed five primers were corrected by refractory modification. MICA
genotypes by ASPE on microarrays showed the same results as those by nucleotide
sequencing. On the basis of these results, ASPE on microarrays may provide
high-throughput genotyping for MICA alleles for population studies, disease-gene 
associations and HSCT.
