The atomic force microscope was used to image adsorption of a monoclonal IgM on
mica in real time. Under the smallest possible force we could achieve (<4 nN),
the cantilever tip behaved as a molecular broom and was observed to orient
protein aggregates in strands oriented perpendicularly to the facet of the
cantilever tip. Rotating the scan direction preserved the orientational
relationship, as seen by the formation of rotated strands. When the applied force
was increased, the distance between the strands increased, indicating the amount 
of protein that can be swept depends on the applied force. The effect of scanning
increased the apparent surface coverage of IgM. Manipulation of a deposited
fibrinogen layer with a 4-nN repulsive force was observed only after tens of
minutes, but not to the extent that strands formed, indicating a greater adhesion
between the fibrinogen and mica than between IgM and mica. With an applied
repulsive force of 30 nN, fibrinogen strands formed and the protein was
manipulated to produce the block letter U. At a much higher repulsive force, the 
entire scanning area was swept clean.
