Fur (ferric uptake regulator) protein is a DNA-binding protein which regulates
iron-responsive genes. Recombinant Fur from the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium
Anabaena PCC 7119 has been purified and characterized, and polyclonal antibodies 
obtained. The experimental data show that Fur from Anabaena dimerizes in solution
with the involvement of disulphide bridges. Cross-linking experiments and
MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight) MS also
show several oligomerization states of Fur, and the equilibrium of these forms
depends on protein concentration and ionic strength. In intact recombinant Fur,
four cysteine residues out of five were inert towards DTNB
[5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)], and their modification required sodium
borohydride. Metal analysis and electrospray ionization MS revealed that neither 
zinc nor other metals are present in this Fur protein. Purified recombinant Fur
bound to its own promoter in gel-shift assays. Fur was shown to be a constitutive
protein in Anabaena cells, with no significant difference in its expression in
cells grown under iron-sufficient compared with iron-deficient conditions.
