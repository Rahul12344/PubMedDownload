A strain of Bacillus methylotrophicus was isolated from a soil sample collected
in Aswan eastern desert, which is known for its extremely arid climate. After
fermentation of the strain in liquid culture and subsequent extraction, a
bioassay-guided isolation procedure yielded five compounds:
2-benzyl-4H-pyran-4-one, named bacillopyrone (1), pyrophen (2), macrolactin A (3)
and the cyclopeptides malformin A1 (4), and bacillopeptin A (5). The structures
were determined by interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) data. This is the
first report on the isolation of compounds 1 and 2 from Bacillus species;
compound 1 was reported previously as synthetic product. Bacillopyrone (1)
exhibited moderate activity against the Gram-negative Chromobacterium violaceum
with minimum inhibitory concentration 266.6 μg/mL, while macrolactin A (3) and
malformin A1 (4) inhibited Staphylococcus aureus (minimum inhibitory
concentrations 13.3 and 133.3 μg/mL, respectively).
