Acral fibromyxoma (AF) is a slow growing benign soft tissue tumor with
predilection to subungal and periungal region of the hands or feet. CD34 is
consistently expressed whereas very recently loss of Rb1 expression was described
as a possible driver molecular event for this entity. Herein we present two
additional cases of AF with loss of Rb1 expression by IHC and subsequent
confirmation of loss of the RB1 gene locus by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH). We hope to raise awareness in dermatopathology community of this new
discovery, which can be diagnostically exploitable for this distinct and probably
underreported neoplasm.
