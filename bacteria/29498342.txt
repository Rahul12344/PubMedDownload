Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of infertility 
in women of reproductive age. Insulin resistance is a main pathophysiologic
feature in these patients. According to some studies, the intake of probiotic
bacteria may improve glucose homoeostasis. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of synbiotics on metabolic parameters and apelin in PCOS
patients. This randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted on 
eighty-eight PCOS women aged 19-37 years old. The participants were randomly
assigned to two groups receiving (1) synbiotic supplement (n 44), and (2) placebo
(n 44) for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken at baseline and after 12
weeks. The two groups showed no difference in fasting blood sugar (adjusted mean 
difference: 0·60; 95 % CI -3·80, 5·00, P=0·727), plasma glucose fasting 2-h
(adjusted mean difference 2·09; 95 % CI -9·96, 14·15, P=0·134), HbA1c (adjusted
mean difference 0·06; 95 % CI -0·09, 0·22, P=0·959), homoeostatic model
assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (adjusted mean difference: 0·02; 95 % CI 
-0·99, 1·03, P=0·837), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI)
(adjusted mean difference: -0·02; 95 % CI -0·33, 0·29, P=0·940) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) (adjusted mean difference: 0·24; 95 % CI -1·61, 2·08, P=0·141) by
the end of the intervention. A significant difference was observed in the mean
apelin 36 before and after the intervention between synbiotic and placebo groups 
(adjusted mean difference: -4·05; 95 % CI -7·15, -0·96, P=0·004). A 12-week
synbiotic supplementation has no significant beneficial effects on HOMA-IR and
CRP in PCOS patients, whereas the level of apelin 36 significantly decreased.
