The adhesion of spores of Bacillus anthracis - the cause of anthrax and a likely 
biological threat - to solid surfaces is an important consideration in cleanup
after an accidental or deliberate release. However, because of safety concerns,
directly studying B. anthracis spores with advanced instrumentation is
problematic. As a first step, we are examining the electrostatic potential of
Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which is a closely related species that is often
used as a simulant to study B. anthracis. Scanning surface potential microscopy
(SSPM), also known as Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), was used to
investigate the influence of relative humidity (RH) on the surface electrostatic 
potential of Bt that had adhered to silica, mica, or gold substrates. AFM/SSPM
side-by-side images were obtained separately in air, at various values of RH,
after an aqueous droplet with spores was applied on each surface and allowed to
dry before measurements. In the SSPM images, a negative potential on the surface 
of the spores was observed compared with that of the substrates. The surface
potential decreased as the humidity increased. Spores were unable to adhere to a 
surface with an extremely negative potential, such as mica.
