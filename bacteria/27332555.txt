Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as chemical spoilage indexes (CSIs) of raw
chicken breast stored aerobically at 4, 10, and 21 °C were identified and
quantified using solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The growth dynamics of total viable
count (TVC), psychrotrophs, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria (LAB),
Brochothrix thermosphacta and H2 S producing bacteria were characterized based on
maximum growth rates (μmax ), maximal microbial concentration (Nmax ) and at the 
moment of microbial shelf life (Svalues ), calculated from Gompertz-fitted growth
curves. Pseudomonas spp. was predominant species, while B. thermosphacta was
characterized by the highest μmax . The microbiological and sensory shelf lives
were estimated based on TVC, Pseudomonas spp., and B. thermosphacta counts and
sensory evaluation, respectively. Among 27 VOCs identified by GC-MS in spoiled
chicken samples, ethanol (EtOH), 1-butanol-3-methyl (1But-3M), and acetic acid
(C2 ) achieved the highest Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.66, 0.61, and 
0.59, respectively, with TVC, regardless of storage temperature. Partial least
squares (PLS) regression revealed that the synthesis of 1But-3M and C2 was most
likely induced by the metabolic activity of B. thermosphacta and LAB, while EtOH 
was attributed to Pseudomonas spp. The increase in concentration of selected
volatile spoilage markers (EtOH, 1But-3M, and C2 ) in the headspace over spoiled 
chicken breast was found to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) with TVC
growth. These findings highlight the possibility of analyzing the combination of 
3 selected spoilage markers: EtOH, 1But-3M, and C2 as rapid evaluation for
poultry quality testing using SPME-GC-MS.
