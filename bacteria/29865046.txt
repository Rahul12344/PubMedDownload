BACKGROUND: It is known that obesity is associated with alterations in blood
rheology and venous hemodynamics. Another recent study has confirmed that adipose
tissue is actively involved in angiogenesis through secretion of biologically
active substances.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact on the venous
haemodynamics of the femoral vein on angiogenesis status in morbidly obese
patients.
METHODS: We studied venous haemodynamics and angiogenesis in a prospective study 
of obese and non-obese individuals. The venous wall shear stress (WSS) was
calculated from the blood viscosity and the shear rate was calculated assuming
Newton's law. Angiogenesis was detected using Bio-Plex Pro Human Angiogenesis
Multiplex Assays (Bio-Plex 200 Systems).
RESULTS: The shear rate (P < 0.000005) and the wall shear stress (P < 0.01) were 
significantly lower in the obese patients compared with the control subjects. All
angiogenesis biomarkers were significantly higher in obese patients compared to
the control group. Multivariate analyses identified waist circumference as an
independent predictor for PECAM-1 (β = - 0.69, P < 0.0001) and for VEGF (β = -
0.60, P < 0.001); analyses identified WSS as an independent predictor for
follistatin (β = - 0.59, P < 0.001), for PECAM-1 (β = - 036, P < 0.05) and for
VEGF (β = - 0.42, P < 0.05). For angiopoietin 2 (β = - 0.35, P = 0.064) and HGF
(β = - 0.31, P = 0.074), WSS tended to be a significant predictor.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that obesity-associated decreases in shear
stress of the venous system lead to upregulation of angiogenesis, expressed by
increased levels of endogenous positive regulators of angiogenesis.
