OBJECTIVE: To develop silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using epigallocatechin gallate
(EGCG) and evaluate its biocompatibility and inhibition effect on Streptococcus
mutans biofilm growth.
DESIGN: AgNPs were synthesized using EGCG as a reducing agent. Cytotoxicity was
assessed using half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) against human
gingival fibroblast (HGF-1) and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth 
(SHED). Antibacterial properties were evaluated with minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against S.
mutans. Dentine blocks were treated with AgNPs, silver nitrate (AgNO3), or water 
before being incubated with S. mutans. The kinetics, morphology and viability of 
the biofilm at different time points were assessed by colony-forming units
(CFUs), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and confocal laser scanning
microscopy (CLSM), respectively. Lactic acid and polysaccharide production of the
biofilm were also investigated.
RESULTS: Spherical AgNPs with diameter 17 ± 7 nm were developed. The IC50 of
AgNPs and AgNO3 against HGF-1 were 44.88 ± 11.39 μg/mL and 11.53 ± 6.96 μg/mL,
respectively (p < 0.001), whereas those against SHED were 68.02 ± 24.48 μg/mL and
9.54 ± 6.63 μg/mL, respectively (p = 0.02). The MIC of AgNPs and AgNO3 were
32.22 ± 7.34 μg/mL and 48.89 ± 15.11 μg/mL, respectively (p = 0.01), whereas
their MBC was 63.33 ± 11.73 μg/mL and 85.00 ± 20.77 μg/mL, respectively
(p = 0.02). Log CFUs of the AgNPs group were the lowest among the groups
(p < 0.001). SEM and CLSM found a confluent biofilm in AgNO3 and water groups but
not in AgNPs group. Biofilms in AgNPs group was revealed with lowest level of
acidic acid and polysaccharides production (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study developed biocompatible AgNPs which inhibited the growth
of a cariogenic biofilm.
