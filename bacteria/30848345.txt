Botcinic acid biosynthesis in Botrytis cinerea relies on a subtelomeric gene
cluster surrounded by relics of transposons and is regulated by the Zn2Cys6
transcription factor BcBoa13.

Botcinic acid is a phytotoxic polyketide involved in the virulence of the gray
mold fungus Botrytis cinerea. Here, we aimed to investigate the specific
regulation of the cluster of Bcboa genes that is responsible for its
biosynthesis. Our analysis showed that this cluster is located in a subtelomeric 
genomic region containing alternating G + C/A + T-balanced regions, and
A + T-rich regions made from transposable elements that underwent RIP
(Repeat-Induced Point mutation). Genetic analyses demonstrated that BcBoa13, a
putative Zn2Cys6 transcription factor, is a nuclear protein with a major positive
regulatory role on the expression of other Bcboa1-to-Bcboa12 genes, and botcinic 
acid production. In conclusion, the structure and the regulation of the botcinic 
acid gene cluster show similar features with the cluster responsible for the
biosynthesis of the other known phytotoxin produced by B. cinerea, i.e., the
sesquiterpene botrydial. Both clusters contain a gene encoding a pathway-specific
Zn2Cys6 positive regulator, and both are surrounded by relics of transposons
which raise some questions about the role of these repeated elements in the
evolution and regulation of the secondary metabolism gene clusters in Botrytis.
