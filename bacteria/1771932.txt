This study examines whether infections with Helicobacter pylori are more frequent
in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis than in patients with
non-inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The study furthermore examines whether the
colonisation by H. pylori is favoured by antiphlogistic-antirheumatic treatment. 
For this purpose gastric biopsies obtained by endoscopy from 123 patients were
histologically evaluated for the presence of H. pylori. 85 patients with
rheumatoid arthritis were compared with 38 patients with non-inflammatory
rheumatic diseases. Although an increased susceptibility for infections can be
expected in persons with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing long-term antirheumatic 
treatment, this could not be confirmed by our results for the colonisation of the
stomach by H. pylori. It is therefore statistically confirmed that rheumatoid
arthritis itself and treatment with short-term effective antirheumatic drugs has 
no significant influence on the colonisation rate. Still it is doubtful whether
any lesion associated with NSAR and H. pylori must necessarily be considered an
NSAR-"induced". Future studies will have to elaborate whether NSAR in H. pylori
infected mucosa will lead to higher incidence of damage.
