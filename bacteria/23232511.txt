AIM: To clone human secreted IL-16 cDNA, construct its prokaryotic expression
vector and express it in E.coli DH5α.
METHODS: The secreted IL-16 gene fragment from the cDNA library of human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was amplified by PCR. After purified,
the product was cloned into pUC18 T-vector. The recombinant plasmid was confirmed
by PCR, endonuclease digestion and sequencing analysis and then subcloned into
prokaryotic expression vector pMAL-C2. Then the recombinant expression plasmid
pMAL-IL-16 was transformed into E.coli DH5α. The expression of secreted hIL-16
was induced with IPTG and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
RESULTS: Using PCR, we obtained the human secreted IL-16 cDNA fragment which was 
393 bp and encoded 130 amino acids. The prokaryotic expression vector pMAL-IL-16 
we constructed was successfully transformed into E.coli DH5α, and under the
induction of IPTG, we found the expression of the recombinant fusion protein with
relative molecular weight (M(r);) being 56 000 as expected and confirmed by
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
CONCLUSION: We successfully cloned the human secreted IL-16 cDNA and constructed 
its prokaryotic expression vector and expressed it in E.coli, which is helpful
for further purification of human secreted IL-16 protein.
