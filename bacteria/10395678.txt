MAPK signaling pathway.

CD28 costimulation amplifies TCR-dependent signaling in activated T cells,
however, the biochemical mechanism(s) by which this occurs is not precisely
understood. The small GTPase Rac-1 controls the catalytic activity of the
mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and cell cycle progression through G1. 
Rac-1 activation requires the phospho-tyrosine (p-Tyr)-dependent recruitment of
the Vav GDP releasing factor (GRF) to the plasma membrane and assembly of
GTPase/GRF complexes, an event critical for Ag receptor-triggered T cell
activation. Here, we show that TCR/CD28 costimulation synergistically induces
Rac-1 GDP/GTP exchange. Our findings, obtained by using ZAP-70-negative Jurkat T 
cells, indicate that CD28 costimulation augments TCR-mediated T cell activation
by increasing the ZAP-70-mediated Tyr phosphorylation of Vav. This event
regulates the Rac-1-associated GTP/GDP exchange activity of Vav and downstream
pathway(s) leading to PAK-1 and p38 MAPK activation. CD28 amplifies TCR-induced
ZAP-70 activity and association of Vav with ZAP-70 and linker for activation of T
cells (LAT). These results favor a model in which ZAP-70 regulates the
intersection of the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways, which elicits the coupling
of TCR and CD28 to the Rac-1, PAK-1, and p38 MAPK effector molecules.
