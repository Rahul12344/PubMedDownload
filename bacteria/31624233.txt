Chronic stressful occurrences are documented as a vital cause of both depression 
and anxiety disorders. However, the stress-induced molecular mechanisms
underlying the common and distinct pathophysiology of these disorders remains
largely unclear. We utilized a chronic mild stress (CMS) rat model to
differentiate and subgroup depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, and
insusceptible rats. The hippocampus was analyzed for differential proteomes by
combining mass spectrometry and the isobaric tags for relative and absolute
quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling technique. Out of 2593 quantified proteins, 367
were aberrantly expressed. These hippocampal protein candidates might be
associated with susceptibility to stress-induced depression or anxiety and stress
resilience. They provide the potential protein systems involved in various
metabolic pathways as novel investigative protein targets. Further, independent
immunoblot analysis identified changes in Por, Idh2 and Esd; Glo1, G6pdx, Aldh2, 
and Dld; Dlat, Ogdhl, Anxal, Tpp2, and Sdha that were specifically associated to 
depression-susceptible, anxiety-susceptible, or insusceptible groups
respectively, suggesting that identical CMS differently impacted the
mitochondrial and metabolic processes in the hippocampus. Collectively, the
observed alterations to protein abundance profiles of the hippocampus provided
significant and novel insights into the stress regulation mechanism in a CMS rat 
model. This might serve as the molecular basis for further studies that would
contributed to a better understanding of the similarities and differences in
pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying stress-induced depression or anxiety, and 
stress resiliency.
