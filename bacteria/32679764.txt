The aged population is currently at its highest level in human history and is
expected to increase further in the coming years. In humans, aging is accompanied
by impaired angiogenesis, diminished blood flow and altered metabolism, among
others. A cellular mechanism that impinges upon these manifestations of aging can
be a suitable target for therapeutic intervention. Here we identify cell surface 
receptor CD47 as a novel age-sensitive driver of vascular and metabolic
dysfunction. With the natural aging process, CD47 and its ligand thrombospondin-1
were increased, concurrent with a reduction of self-renewal transcription factors
OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and cMYC (OSKM) in arteries from aged wild-type mice and older
human subjects compared to younger controls. These perturbations were prevented
in arteries from aged CD47-null mice. Arterial endothelial cells isolated from
aged wild-type mice displayed cellular exhaustion with decreased proliferation,
migration and tube formation compared to cells from aged CD47-null mice. CD47
suppressed ex vivo sprouting, in vivo angiogenesis and skeletal muscle blood flow
in aged wild-type mice. Treatment of arteries from older humans with a CD47
blocking antibody mitigated the age-related deterioration in angiogenesis.
Finally, aged CD47-null mice were resistant to age- and diet-associated weight
gain, glucose intolerance and insulin desensitization. These results indicate
that the CD47-mediated signaling maladapts during aging to broadly impair
endothelial self-renewal, angiogenesis, perfusion and glucose homeostasis. Our
findings provide a strong rationale for therapeutically targeting CD47 to
minimize these dysfunctions during aging.
