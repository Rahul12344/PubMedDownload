Recent evidence suggests that interactions among proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and cancer cell-recruited neutrophils result in enhanced metastasis
and chemotherapy resistance. Nonetheless, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.
Our aim was to discover the role of IL-17, CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2)
ligands, and cancer-associated neutrophils in chemotherapy resistance and
metastasis in breast cancer. Mice were injected with Cl66 murine mammary tumor
cells, Cl66 cells resistant to doxorubicin (Cl66-Dox), or Cl66 cells resistant to
paclitaxel (Cl66-Pac). Higher levels of IL-17 receptor, CXCR2 chemokines, and
CXCR2 were observed in tumors generated from Cl66-Dox and Cl66-Pac cells in
comparison with tumors generated from Cl66 cells. Tumors generated from Cl66-Dox 
and Cl66-Pac cells had higher infiltration of neutrophils and T helper 17 cells. 
In comparison with primary tumor sites, there were increased levels of CXCR2,
CXCR2 ligands, and IL-17 receptor within the metastatic lesions. Moreover, IL-17 
increased the expression of CXCR2 ligands and cell proliferation of Cl66 cells.
The supernatant of Cl66-Dox and Cl66-Pac cells enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis. In
addition, IL-17-induced neutrophil chemotaxis was dependent on CXCR2 signaling.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that the IL-17-CXCR2 axis facilitates the
recruitment of neutrophils to the tumor sites, thus allowing them to play a
cancer-promoting role in cancer progression.
