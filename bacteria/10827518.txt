Invasive pneumococcal infections may be severe. We have examined epidemiology,
risk factors and outcome of these infections. In the years 1980-95, 76 children
below the age of 15 with invasive pneumococcal infections were admitted to the
hospitals in the counties of Troms, Nordland and Sør-Trøndelag in Norway. The
incidence rate in children 0-2 years old was 10.3 cases per 100,000 persons per
year, and 1.8 in children 3-14 years. Of the patients 24 had meningitis and 52
bacteraemia. All bacteriological isolates were sensitive to benzylpenicillin.
Seven patients died and five developed sequelae. Thirty-one of the children had
risk factors prior to the infection. Children with hypo- or hyperventilation at
the time of arrival, and/or impaired circulation fared worse than those with
normal findings. Children with underlying risk factors have a much higher
frequency of invasive pneumococcal infections than other children. Patients who
had impaired circulation or ventilation on admission have a bad prognosis for
healthy survival.
