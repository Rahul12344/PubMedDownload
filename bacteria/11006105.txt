A majority of thymocytes undergo apoptosis during differentiation due to lack of 
survival signals provided by T cell receptor (TCR) activation. As glucocorticoids
(GC) have been suggested to be involved in this process, we have investigated the
GC sensitivity in thymocytes from mice expressing a transgenic selecting TCR. We 
now report that immature CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive thymocytes from these mice 
are comparatively more resistant to corticosterone-induced apoptosis. This is
associated with reduced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression, increased levels
of membrane CD28, increased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, and increased binding
to the CD28 response element in the interleukin-2 gene promoter. Analysis of
NF-kappaB/Rel proteins from nuclear extracts demonstrated altered levels of some 
of these proteins. Our results suggest that TCR recognition of self major
histocompatibility antigens generates intracellular signals which alter the
thymocyte GC sensitivity and thereby protect them against apoptosis induced by
endogenous GC.
