Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) activates the Met receptor tyrosine kinase by
binding and promoting receptor dimerization. Here we describe a mechanistic basis
for designing Met antagonists based on NK1, a natural variant of HGF containing
the N-terminal and the first kringle domain. Through detailed biochemical and
structural analyses, we demonstrate that both mouse and human NK1 induce Met
dimerization via a conserved NK1 dimer interface. Mutations designed to alter the
NK1 dimer interface abolish its ability to promote Met dimerization but retain
full Met-binding activity. Importantly, these NK1 mutants act as Met antagonists 
by inhibiting HGF-mediated cell scattering, proliferation, branching, and
invasion. The ability to separate the Met-binding activity of NK1 from its Met
dimerization activity thus provides a rational basis for designing Met
antagonists. This strategy of antagonist design may be applicable for other
growth factor receptors by selectively abolishing the receptor activation ability
but not the receptor binding of the growth factors.
