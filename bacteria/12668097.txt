Atomic force microscopy has been used to characterise populations of extracted
water-soluble wheat endosperm arabinoxylans. The adsorbed molecules are extended 
structures with an estimated Kuhn statistical segment length of 128 nm,
suggesting that they adopt an ordered helical structure. However, estimates of
the molecular weight distribution, coupled with size exclusion data, suggest
that, in solution, the polysaccharides behave as semi-flexible coils, with a Kuhn
length of 16 nm. These data imply that adsorption of the arabinoxylan structures 
onto mica promotes formation of the helical structure. Adoption of this ordered
structure is fortunate because it has permitted characterisation of branching
observed in a small proportion (approximately 15%) of the population of otherwise
linear molecules. The degree of branching has been found to increase with the
contour length of the molecules. Degradation of the polysaccharides with xylanase
has been used to confirm that both the backbone and branches are based on
beta-(1-->4) linked D-xylopyranosyl residues.
