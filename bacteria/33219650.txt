Global expansion of antimicrobial drug-resistant Escherichia coli sequence type
(ST) 131 is unrivaled among human bacteria. Understanding trends among ST131
clades will help with designing prevention strategies. We screened E. coli from
blood samples (n = 1,784) obtained in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, during 2006,
2012, and 2016 by PCR for ST131 and positive samples (n = 344) underwent
whole-genome sequencing. The incidence rate per 100,000 residents increased from 
4.91 during 2006 to 12.35 during 2012 and 10.12 during 2016. ST131 belonged to
clades A (10%), B (9%), and C (81%). Clades C1-nonM27 and B were common during
2006, and C2 containing blaCTX-M-15, C1-M27 containing blaCTX-M-27, and A were
responsible for the increase of ST131 during 2012 and 2016. C2 was the most
antimicrobial drug-resistant subclade and increased exponentially over time.
Eradicating ST131, more specifically the C2 subclade, will lead to considerable
public health benefits for persons in Calgary.
