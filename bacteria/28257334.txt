OBJECTIVE: The prevailing theory of host response during sepsis states that an
excessive production of pro-inflammatory mediators causes early deaths, whereas a
predominantly anti-inflammatory response may lead to immunosuppression, secondary
infection, and late deaths. We assessed inflammatory (im)balance by measuring
pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 and anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 during three 
distinct time periods after sepsis, and assessed its association with mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort.
SETTING: Two tertiary mixed ICUs in The Netherlands.
PATIENTS: Consecutive patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock from
2011 to 2013.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We repeatedly measured plasma interleukin-6 and
interleukin-10 concentrations using cytometric bead array. Poisson regression was
used to analyze the relation between inflammatory markers measured on 1) ICU
admission and day 4 mortality, 2) day 4 and day 28 mortality, and 3) ICU
discharge and 1-year mortality. Secondary outcome was development of ICU-acquired
infections. Among 708 patients, 86 (12%) died within 4 days, 140 (20%) died
between days 4 and 28, and an additional 155 (22%) died before 1 year.
Interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 levels were both independently associated with
mortality, but the balance of this response as modelled by an interleukin-6 and
interleukin-10 interaction term was not (relative risk, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.95-1.04
on admission; relative risk, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98-1.06 on day 4; and relative risk,
1.12; 95% CI, 0.98-1.29 at ICU discharge). However, inflammatory imbalance on day
4 was associated with development of ICU-acquired infections (subdistribution
hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.98).
CONCLUSIONS: Although both interleukin-6 and interleukin-10 productions are
associated with death, the balance of these inflammatory mediators does not seem 
to impact either early, intermediate, or late mortality in patients presenting to
the ICU with sepsis.
