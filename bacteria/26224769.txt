BACKGROUND: The hollow fiber system model of tuberculosis (HFS-TB), in tandem
with Monte Carlo experiments, represents a drug development tool (DDT) with the
potential for use to develop tuberculosis treatment regimens. However, the
predictive accuracy of the HFS-TB, or any other nonclinical DDT such as an animal
model, has yet to be robustly evaluated.
METHODS: To avoid hindsight bias, a literature search was performed to identify
clinical studies published at least 6 months after HFS-TB experiments'
quantitative predictions. Steps to minimize bias and for reporting systematic
reviews were applied as outlined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Publications were scored for quality of evidence.
Accuracy was calculated using the mean absolute percentage error, then summated
with weighting assigned by sample size and quality-of-evidence score. Given the
lack of a gold-standard tuberculosis DDT, the forecasting accuracy of a
completely unreliable tool was also calculated from 1000 simulated experiments
for a random or "total guesswork" model.
RESULTS: The quantitative forecasting accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]) for
the "total guesswork" model was 15.6% (95% CI, 8.7%-22.5%); bias was -0.1% (95%
CI, -2.5% to 2.2%). Twenty clinical studies were published after HFS-TB
experiments predicted optimal drug exposures and doses, susceptibility
breakpoints, and optimal combination regimens. Based on these clinical studies,
the predictive accuracy of the HFS-TB was 94.4% (95% CI, 84.3%-99.9%), and bias
was 1.8% (95% CI, -13.7% to 6.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: The HFS-TB model is highly accurate at forecasting optimal drug
exposures, doses, and dosing schedules for use in the clinic.
