High molecular weight (Mr around 175 KD) forms of C4d and C3d as well as free C4d
and C3d (Mr about 40 KD) were demonstrable in normal human serum (NHS). Following
in vitro C activation in NHS by delta IgG, the 40 KD C4d component increased
markedly. By immunofixation it was shown that the high molecular forms of C4d and
C3d reacted with biotinylated anti-human albumin IgG, whereas the 40 KD-free C4d 
and C3d fragments did not. Furthermore, the incorporation of anti-albumin IgG in 
the first dimensional gel in crossed immunoelectrophoresis caused retention of
the 175 KD C4d component but not of free C4d. The 175 KD C4d had a distinctly
higher electrophoretic migration velocity (post-albumin region) than the 40 KD
C4d fragment. The C3d-, C4d-serum albumin complexes could not be dissociated by
reducing agents (DTT, mercaptoethanol), a non-ionic detergent, or exposure to
high and low ionic strength.
