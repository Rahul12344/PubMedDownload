Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are a major
global public health concern. Presently, Escherichia coli with CTX-Ms are the
most common species associated with global ESBLs; CTX-M-15 is the most frequent
CTX-M worldwide and is followed by CTX-M-14, which is often found in South-East
Asia. Recent surveillance studies showed that CTX-M-27 is emerging in certain
parts of the world especially in Japan and Europe. The population structure of
ESBL-producing E. coli is dominated globally by an high-risk clone named ST131.
Escherichia coli ST131 belongs to three clades (A, B, and C) and three different 
subclades (C1, C1-M27, and C2). Clade C1-M27 is associated with blaCTX-M-27, and 
C2 with blaCTX-M-15. Recent whole genome sequencing studies have shown that clade
C has evolved from clade B in a stepwise fashion, resulting in one of the most
influential global antimicrobial resistance clones that has emerged during the
2000's. Other important E. coli clones that have been detected among ESBL
producers include ST405, ST38, ST648, ST410, and ST1193. The INCREMENT project
has shown that ertapenem is as effective as other carbapenems for treating
serious infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The results of the
MERINO open-label randomized controlled study has provided clear evidence that
piperacillin-tazobactam should be avoided for targeted therapy of blood-stream
infections due to ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, regardless of the
patient population, source of infection, bacterial species, and susceptibility
result of piperacillin-tazobactam. Research is still warranted to define the
optimal therapy of less severe infections due to ESBL-producing
Enterobactericeae.
