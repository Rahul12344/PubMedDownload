Lantibiotics are a group of highly post-translationally modified bacterial
antimicrobial peptides characterized by the presence of the thioether-containing 
amino acids lanthionine and methyllanthionine. Carnobacterium maltaromaticum C2
was found to produce a two-component lantibiotic homologous to enterococcal
cytolysin. Through tandem mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, the
post-translational modifications of carnolysin were established, and the
topologies of the lanthionine and methyllanthionine rings were determined. Chiral
GC-MS analysis revealed that, like cytolysin, carnolysin contained lanthionine
and methyllanthionine residues of unusual stereochemistry. Carnolysin, unlike
cytolysin, was shown to contain d-alanine and unprecedented D-aminobutyrate
derived from serine and threonine, respectively. Carnolysin was heterologously
expressed in Escherichia coli, demonstrating that reductase CrnJ is involved in
the formation of the D-amino acids.
