Synthetic peptides Phd1-3 spanning the cationic carboxy-terminal region of human 
beta-defensins HBD-1-3 have been shown to have antibacterial activity. Gross
morphological changes were seen in E. coli cells treated with these peptides. In 
this paper, we have studied the surface-active properties of peptides Phd1-3 and 
their interactions with different phospholipids using Langmuir-Blodgett
monolayers. Compression isotherms and increase in pressure on insertion of
peptides into lipid monolayers at different initial pressures indicate the
affinity of these peptides for negatively charged lipids. Phd3 inserted less
effectively into monolayers as compared to Phd1 and Phd2. The peptides differed
in their ability to permeabilize the inner membrane of E. coli, with Phd3 being
least effective. It is likely that the peptides kill Gram-negative bacteria by
more than one mechanism. When hydrophobicity and net charge favor insertion into 
lipid membranes, then membrane permeabilization could be the primary event in the
killing of bacteria. In cases where membrane insertion does not occur,
interaction with phospholipid interface induces highly selective stress that
leads to stasis and cell death, as proposed for polymyxin B and bactenecin.
