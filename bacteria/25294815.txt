M2 macrophages promote tumor growth and metastasis, but their interactions with
specific tumor cell populations are poorly characterized. Using a mouse model of 
spontaneous melanoma, we showed that CD34- but not CD34+ tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) depend on M2 macrophages for survival and proliferation. Tumor-associated 
macrophages (TAMs) and macrophage-conditioned media protected CD34- TICs from
chemotherapy in vitro. In vivo, while inhibition of CD115 suppressed the
macrophage-dependent CD34- TIC population, chemotherapy accelerated its
development. The ability of TICs to respond to TAMs was acquired during melanoma 
progression and immediately preceded a surge in metastatic outgrowth. TAM-derived
transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and polyamines produced via the Arginase
pathway were critical for stimulation of TICs and synergized to promote their
growth.
