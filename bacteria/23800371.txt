The article deals with a novel electrochemical method of preparing
nano-photocatalysts suspended in aqueous solution and their application for water
treatment from chloro-organic compounds and bacteria. The nano-photocatalysts
have been electrolytically synthesized in the cell with titanium and graphite
electrodes. The synthesized nano-photocatalysts based on nanocarbon-titanium
composition have the active functional groups including carbonyl (>C=O), hydroxyl
(-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), and photocatalytic -Ti(OH)-O-Ti(OH)- formed on the
surface of carbon nanoparticles. Here, we report that the synthesized
nano-photocatalysts can destroy chloro-organic compounds including
dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT), aldrin (C12H8Cl6), lindane (C6H6Cl6),
and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bacteria Escherichia coli in water under
UV and sunlight. In addition, the method of nano-photocatalysts detection in
water has been described.
