HSPC144 is a newly identified gene in human CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor
cells. In this work, we have expressed and purified the 225-residue protein from 
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and identified a stable fragment HSPC144-P (residues 
44-225) by limited proteolysis method. The HSPC144-P fragment exhibits high
stability with a little increase of secondary structure percentage as compared
with the full-length protein. We anticipated that the N-terminally truncated
protein possesses a more compact structure. By sequence analysis, the proteolytic
fragment shares a great similarity with DUF589 domain, a previously identified
domain with unknown function. This novel domain is highly conserved in Thy28
proteins and is worthy of structural and functional studies. We have subcloned
this homologous domain from HSPC144 protein and purified to homogeneity for
structure analysis. The (15)N and (15)N/(13)C-labeled DUF589 domain samples have 
been prepared successfully and determination of the NMR structure is in progress.
