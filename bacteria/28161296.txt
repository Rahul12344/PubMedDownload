Infections due to Talaromyces spp. are uncommon, but they have been reported
previously as causative agents of disease in immunocompromised patients. The
prognosis of hemato-oncological patients with an invasive fungal infection is
generally poor and the identification of the causative agent is usually not
achieved or in some cases the isolated agent is taken as a contaminant and not
treated, which contributes to their bad outcome. We report a case of Talaromyces 
amestolkiae pulmonary infection in an acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient, which
was successfully treated with voriconazole, and discuss the importance of
molecular identification and treatment of non-traditionally pathogenic fungi in
this specific subset of patients.
