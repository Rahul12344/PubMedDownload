We analysed the effect of HLA loci on the secondary sex ratio, and investigated
whether allele sharing between parents and between mother and child, or child
homozygosity, affected the viability of male embryos, which are generally less
resistant to unfavourable conditions during pregnancy. The sharing conditions at 
the B and DR loci showed significantly differing effects: HLA-B seemed to favour 
female births, while, in pregnancies subsequent to the first, HLA-DR seemed to
favour male births. Both HLA-B and DR loci seemed to work through immunological
mechanisms.
