BACKGROUND: The most frequent infectious complication in transfusion therapy in
developed countries is related to the bacterial contamination of platelet
concentrates (PCs). Rapid and cultural screening methods for bacterial detection 
in platelets are available, but external performance evaluation, especially of
rapid methods, has been difficult to realize so far. Here we summarize the
results of three individual collaborative trials using an external quality
assessment program (EQAP) for the application of current rapid and cultural
screening methods.
METHODS: Three different modules were available for the detection of bacterial
contamination: module 1: rapid methods, module 2: culture methods, module 3:
bacterial identification methods. The sample set-up included up to six different 
bacterial strains, 1-2 negative samples and 4-6 positive samples with stabilized 
bacterial cell counts (approximately 10(3)/10(4)/10(5) CFU/ml). Time schedule for
testing was limited (module 1: 6 h, module 2 and 3: 7 days).
RESULTS: Samples of module 1 were analyzed with two different rapid methods
(BactiFlow, NAT). The results of the three individual collaborative trials showed
that all participants detected the negative samples with both assays correctly.
Samples spiked with 10(4) to 10(5) CFU/ml of bacteria obtained positive results
with both rapid screening methods, whereas samples spiked with only 10(3) CFU/ml 
disclosed a lower number of correctly identified positive results by NAT
(86.6-93.8% sensitivity) compared to BactiFlow (100% sensitivity). The results
for modules 2 and 3 revealed a 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in all
three collaborative trials.
CONCLUSION: This proficiency panel facilitates the verification of the analytical
sensitivity of rapid and cultural bacterial detection systems under controlled
routine conditions. The concept of samples provided in this EQAP has three main
advantages: i) samples can be examined by both rapid and culture methods, ii) the
provided material is matrix-equivalent, and iii) the sample material is
ready-to-use.
