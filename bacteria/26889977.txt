BACKGROUND: The novel chemokine CXCL17 acts as chemoattractant for monocytes,
macrophages and dendritic cells. CXCL17 also has a role in angiogenesis of
importance for tumour development.
METHODS: Expression of CXCL17, CXCL10, CXCL9 and CCL2 was assessed in primary
colon cancer tumours, colon carcinoma cell lines and normal colon tissue at mRNA 
and protein levels by real-time qRT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, two-colour
immunofluorescence and immunomorphometry.
RESULTS: CXCL17 mRNA was expressed at 8000 times higher levels in primary tumours
than in normal colon (P < 0.0001). CXCL17 protein was seen in 17.2% of cells in
tumours as compared with 0.07% in normal colon (P = 0.0002). CXCL10, CXCL9 and
CCL2 mRNAs were elevated in tumours but did not reach the levels of CXCL17.
CXCL17 and CCL2 mRNA levels were significantly correlated in tumours. Concordant 
with the mRNA results, CXCL10- and CXCL9-positive cells were detected in tumour
tissue, but at significantly lower numbers than CXCL17. Two-colour
immunofluorescence and single-colour staining of consecutive sections for CXCL17 
and the epithelial cell markers carcinoembryonic antigen and BerEP4 demonstrated 
that colon carcinoma tumour cells indeed expressed CXCL17.
CONCLUSIONS: CXCL17 is ectopically expressed in primary colon cancer tumours. As 
CXCL17 enhances angiogenesis and attracts immune cells, its expression could be
informative for prognosis in colon cancer patients.
