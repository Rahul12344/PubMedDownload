BACKGROUND: We evaluated the association between mortality and colistin
resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii infections and the interaction with
antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of
patients with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections treated
with colistin or colistin-meropenem combination. We evaluated patients with
infection caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) identified as
colistin susceptible (CoS) at the time of treatment and compared patients in
which the isolate was confirmed as CoS with those whose isolates were
retrospectively identified as colistin resistant (CoR) when tested by broth
microdilution (BMD). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality.
RESULTS: Data were available for 266 patients (214 CoS and 52 CoR isolates).
Patients with CoR isolates had higher baseline functional capacity and lower
rates of mechanical ventilation than patients with CoS isolates. All-cause 28-day
mortality was 42.3% (22/52) among patients with CoR strains and 52.8% (113/214)
among patients with CoS isolates (P = .174). After adjusting for variables
associated with mortality, the mortality rate was lower among patients with CoR
isolates (odds ratio [OR], 0.285 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .118-.686]). This
difference was associated with treatment arm: Mortality rates among patients with
CoR isolates were higher in those randomized to colistin-meropenem combination
therapy compared to colistin monotherapy (OR, 3.065 [95% CI, 1.021-9.202]).
CONCLUSIONS: Colistin resistance determined by BMD was associated with lower
mortality among patients with severe CRAB infections. Among patients with CoR
isolates, colistin monotherapy was associated with a better outcome compared to
colistin-meropenem combination therapy.
