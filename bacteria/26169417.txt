A Salmonella enterica serovar Corvallis strain was isolated from a wild bird in
Germany. This strain carried the IncA/C2 pRH-1238 plasmid. Complete sequencing of
the plasmid was performed, identifying the blaNDM-1, blaCMY-16, fosA3, sul1,
sul2, strA, strB, aac(6')-Ib, aadA5, aphA6, tetA(A), mphA, floR, dfrA7, and merA 
genes, which confer clinically relevant resistance to most of the antimicrobial
classes, including β-lactams with carbapenems, fosfomycin, aminoglycosides,
co-trimoxazole, tetracyclines, and macrolides. The strain likely originated from 
the Asiatic region and was transferred to Germany through the Milvus migrans
migratory route.
