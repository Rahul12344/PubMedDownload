Significant improvement in the resolution and quality of the X-ray diffraction of
crystals of MTCP-1 protein was observed on post-crystallization soaking. The
MTCP-1 crystals grown from 1.5 M ammonium sulfate diffracted to only 3.0 A
resolution with some disorder in the diffraction. After post-crystallization
soaking in a solution containing 2.0 M ammonium sulfate, the disorder was
eliminated and diffraction extended to better than 2.0 A resolution. Both native 
and selenomethionine-enriched crystals demonstrated better diffraction after
soaking for several months. This simple technique may be useful to improve the
diffraction quality of protein crystals generally.
