The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If
anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it
could drive further planetary warming. Despite evidence that warming enhances
carbon fluxes to and from the soil, the net global balance between these
responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of
warming-induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field
experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the
effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock,
with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this 
empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon
sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections.
Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper
soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of 
carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of
warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil
carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario
would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons 
by 2050. This value is around 12-17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic
emissions over this period. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our
estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across 
all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising
temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere,
driving a positive land carbon-climate feedback that could accelerate climate
change.
