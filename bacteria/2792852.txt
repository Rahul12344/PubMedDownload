[Article in Polish]

Rzepka-Górska I, Sowińska E, Wilczyńska E.

Having examined 538 patients of the Outpatient Clinic of Children Nephrology
directed to the Clinic of Gynaecology of Developmental age in Szczecin, the
authors found that urinary tract infections are in 58.5% of cases accompanied by 
vaginitis. This refers to 81.6% of girls in the period of the so called "hormonal
silence". Among the girls examined, 51,5% of them had III microbiological picture
of vagina and cultures from vagina revealed the presence of enteric bacteria. It 
was also found that bad sanitary and hygienic conditions have an unfavourable
influence on the microbiological state of vagina in girls. A symptom of
appreciation of the problem of urinary system infections accompanied by
inflammatory process in vagina by a pediatrician and children's gynaecologist is 
an increase in visiting a children's gynaecologist from 35-56% in particular
years.
