PURPOSE: The aberrant Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/ mesenchymal-epithelial
transition factor (c-Met) signaling pathway in various malignancies and its
correlation with tumor invasion and poor prognosis has validated c-Met as a
compelling therapeutic target. Up to now, several monoclonal antibodies and small
molecule inhibitors targeting c-Met have been introduced with different outcomes,
none are yet clinically approved. Toward the generation of novel fully human
anti-c-Met molecules, we generated a large naïve Fab antibody library using phage
display technology, which subsequently screened for novel Fabs against c-Met.
METHODS: A phage library, with a functional size of 5.5 × 1010 individual
antibody clones, was prepared using standard protocols and screened for
c-Met-specific Fabs by successive rounds of panning. A panel of Fabs targeting
c-Met were isolated, from which four clones were selected and further
characterized by DNA sequencing. The c-Met binding ability of our selected Fabs
was evaluated by c-Met ELISA assay and flow cytometry techniques.
RESULTS: Among the confirmed anti-c-Met Fabs, clone C16, showed the highest
affinity (Kaff: 0.3 × 109 M-1), and 63% binding to MKN45 cells (a human gastric
adenocarcinoma cell-line) as compared to c-Met negative T47D cell-line (9.03%).
CONCLUSION: Together, our study presents a single-pot antibody library, as a
valuable source for finding a range of antigen-specific Fab antibodies, and also,
a fully human, high affinity and specific anti c-Met Fab antibody, C16, which has
the potential of developing as a therapeutic or chemotherapeutic delivery agent
for killing c-Met-positive tumor cells.
