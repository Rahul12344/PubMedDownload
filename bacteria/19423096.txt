Primary human uterine, cervical, and ectocervical stromal fibroblasts
constitutively secrete hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), yet only uterine stromal
fibroblasts increase HGF secretion in response to estradiol. Estradiol-induced
HGF secretion by uterine stromal fibroblasts may have a significant effect on
uterine cancer and endometriosis.
