The transformation dynamics of 2- and 4-cyanopyridines by cells suspended and
adsorbed on inorganic carriers has been studied in the Rhodococcus ruber gt 1
strain possessing nitrile hydratase activity and the Pseudomonas fluorescens C2
strain containing nitrilase. It was shown that both nitrile hydratase and
nitrilase activities of immobilized cells against 2-cyanopyridine were 1.5-4
times lower compared to 4-cyanopyridine and 1.6-2 times lower than the activities
of free cells against 2-cyanpopyridine. The possibility of obtaining isonicotinic
acid during the combined conversion of 4-cyanopyridine by a mixed suspension of
R. ruber gt 1 cells with a high level of nitrile hydratase activity and R.
erythropolis 11-2 cells with a pronounced activity of amidase has been shown.
Immobilization of Rhodococcus cells on raw coal and Pseudomonas cells on china
clay was shown to yield a heterogeneous biocatalyst for the efficient
transformation of cyanopyridines into respective amides and carbonic acids.
