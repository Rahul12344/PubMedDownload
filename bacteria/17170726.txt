T-, B- and NK-lymphoid, but not myeloid cells arise from human
CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) common lymphoid progenitors expressing lymphoid-specific
genes.

Hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) give rise to all blood cells.
According to the classic model of hematopoiesis, the differentiation paths
leading to the myeloid and lymphoid lineages segregate early. A candidate 'common
lymphoid progenitor' (CLP) has been isolated from CD34(+)CD38(-) human cord blood
cells based on CD7 expression. Here, we confirm the B- and NK-differentiation
potential of CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells and show in addition that this population
has strong capacity to differentiate into T cells. As CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+) cells 
are virtually devoid of myeloid differentiation potential, these cells represent 
true CLPs. To unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphoid commitment, we
performed genome-wide gene expression profiling on sorted CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(+)
and CD34(+)CD38(-)CD7(-) cells. Interestingly, lymphoid-affiliated genes were
mainly upregulated in the CD7(+) population, while myeloid-specific genes were
downregulated. This supports the hypothesis that lineage commitment is
accompanied by the shutdown of inappropriate gene expression and the upregulation
of lineage-specific genes. In addition, we identified several highly expressed
genes that have not been described in hematopoiesis before.
