Three new phthalide derivatives, emefuranones A1, A2 and B (1-3); six new
phthalane derivatives, emefuran A, B1, B2, C1, C2 and D (4-9); three new
farnesylated phthalide derivatives, farnesylemefuranones A-C (10-12); xylarinol C
(13); and emericelloxide (14), along with four known compounds (dustanin,
sorbicillin, aspergillodiol and xylarinol A), were isolated from the culture
extracts of Emericella sp. IFM57991. Structures of 1-14 were elucidated on the
basis of spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence. Compounds 4-7 and 13
showed moderate antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis.
