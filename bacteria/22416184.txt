AIM: To investigate the correlation between autoimmune thyroid diseases (ATDs)
and the prevalence of Cag-A positive strains of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)
in stool samples.
METHODS: Authors investigated 112 consecutive Caucasian patients (48 females and 
4 males with Graves' disease and 54 females and 6 males with Hashimoto's
thyroiditis HT), at their first diagnosis of ATDs. Authors tested for H. pylori
in stool samples using an amplified enzyme immunoassay and Cag-A in serum samples
using an enzyme-linked immunoassay method (ELISA). The results were analyzed
using the two-sided Fisher's exact test and the respective odds ratio (OR) was
calculated.
RESULTS: A marked correlation was found between the presence of H. pylori (P ≤
0.0001, OR 6.3) and, in particular, Cag-A positive strains (P ≤ 0.005, OR 5.3) in
Graves' disease, but not in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, where authors found only a
correlation with Cag-A strains (P ≤ 0.005, OR 8.73) but not when H. pylori was
present.
CONCLUSION: The marked correlation between H. pylori and Cag-A, found in ATDs,
could be dependent on the different expression of adhesion molecules in the
gastric mucosa.
