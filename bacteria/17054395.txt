Anthrax toxin receptors 1 and 2 (ANTXR1 and ANTXR2) have a related integrin-like 
inserted (I) domain which interacts with a metal cation that is coordinated by
residue D683 of the protective antigen (PA) subunit of anthrax toxin. The
receptor-bound metal ion and PA residue D683 are critical for ANTXR1-PA binding. 
Since PA can bind to ANTXR2 with reduced affinity in the absence of metal ions,
we reasoned that D683 mutant forms of PA might specifically interact with ANTXR2.
We show here that this is the case. The differential ability of ANTXR1 and ANTXR2
to bind D683 mutant PA proteins was mapped to nonconserved receptor residues at
the binding interface with PA domain 2. Moreover, a D683K mutant form of PA that 
bound specifically to human and rat ANTXR2 mediated killing of rats by anthrax
lethal toxin, providing strong evidence for the physiological importance of
ANTXR2 in anthrax disease pathogenesis.
