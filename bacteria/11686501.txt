In up to 90% of cases, severe halitosis is a result of gastrointestinal or
orolaryngeal problems. This case study reports on a girl with bad breath caused
by increased formation of malodorous intestinal gases (halitosis), which could be
successfully treated with a suspension of living non-pathogenic bacteria
Escherichia coli.CONCLUSION: in unclear cases of bad breath, an increased
formation of intestinal gases should also be considered.
