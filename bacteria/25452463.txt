αβ and γδ T cells are disparate T cell lineages that can respond to distinct
antigens (Ags) via the use of the αβ and γδ T cell Ag receptors (TCRs),
respectively. Here we characterize a population of human T cells, which we term
δ/αβ T cells, expressing TCRs comprised of a TCR-δ variable gene (Vδ1) fused to
joining α and constant α domains, paired with an array of TCR-β chains. We
demonstrate that these cells, which represent ∼50% of all Vδ1(+) human T cells,
can recognize peptide- and lipid-based Ags presented by human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) and CD1d, respectively. Similar to type I natural killer T (NKT) cells,
CD1d-lipid Ag-reactive δ/αβ T cells recognized α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer);
however, their fine specificity for other lipid Ags presented by CD1d, such as
α-glucosylceramide, was distinct from type I NKT cells. Thus, δ/αβTCRs contribute
new patterns of Ag specificity to the human immune system. Furthermore, we
provide the molecular bases of how δ/αβTCRs bind to their targets, with the
Vδ1-encoded region providing a major contribution to δ/αβTCR binding. Our
findings highlight how components from αβ and γδTCR gene loci can recombine to
confer Ag specificity, thus expanding our understanding of T cell biology and TCR
diversity.
