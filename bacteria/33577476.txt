OBJECTIVE: The aim: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of
treatment-and-prophylactic complex in patients addicted to tobacco with chronic
generalized periodontitis with chronic hyperacid gastritis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 68 patients (men and women) aged
25-44 years were examined. They were distributed into two groups: the main group 
- 48 patients addicted to tobacco with chronic generalized 1 degree periodontitis
and chronic hyperacid gastritis, associated with Helicobacter pylori, the control
group - 20 healthy individuals without bad habits. Patients of the main group
were distributed at random into 2 subgroups (1.1, 1.2) depending on the chosen
therapy. The patients of the subgroup 1.1 received the basic therapy and the
developed treatment and prophylactic complex, the subgroup 1.2 received the basic
therapy and the ultraphonophoresis procedures with placebo. Assessment of the
effectiveness of therapy was carried out by determining hygienic index OHI-S and 
periodontal indices (PI, PMA index and Muhlemann bleeding index (MBI)).
RESULTS: Results: The usage of the treatment-and-prophylactic complex resulted in
improvement of the hygienic index OHI-S and periodontal indices (PI, PMA index
and MBI) at the immediate and late observation period.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Results of the study confirmed the effectiveness of the 
proposed treatment-and-prophylactic complex in therapy of chronic generalized 1
degree periodontitis in patients addicted to tobacco smoking with chronic
hyperacid gastritis.
