In Jurkat T lymphocytes, hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) potentiates the
phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
caused by T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 or
anti-CD3 alone. Submillimolar concentrations of H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation 
of ERK1/2 and MAP/ERK kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2) without antigenic stimulation.
H(2)O(2) also induced the electrophoretic mobility shift of Lck from 56 to 60
kDa. The MEK inhibitor, PD98059 attenuated ERK1/2 and MEK1/2 phosphorylation, as 
well as the migration shift of Lck induced by H(2)O(2). The phospholipase C (PLC)
inhibitor, U73122, and EGTA reduced the phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and MEK1/2
induced by H(2)O(2). Interestingly, an increase of intracellular cAMP level with 
forskolin or 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP augmented ERK1/2 phosphorylation by
H(2)O(2), while inhibiting MEK1/2 phosphorylation by H(2)O(2). These results
demonstrate an alternative pathway that results in augmentation of ERK1/2
phosphorylation without concomitant MEK1/2 phosphorylation in T cells.
