BACKGROUND: Adults with IgG subclass deficiency (IgGSD) with subnormal IgG2 are
inadequately characterized.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed observations in unrelated adults with IgGSD 
evaluated in a single hematology clinic (1991-2019) and selected those with
subnormal serum IgG2 (<117 mg/dL (<1.2 g/L)) without corticosteroid therapy to
describe: age; prevalence of women; upper/lower respiratory infection; autoimmune
condition(s); atopy; other allergy; frequent or severe respiratory tract
infection in first-degree relatives; IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, and IgM; blood
lymphocyte subpopulations; human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A and -B types and
haplotypes; and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination (PPSV23)
responses. We determined the prevalence of subnormal IgG2 among unrelated adults 
with IgGSD without corticosteroid therapy and compared general characteristics of
those with and without subnormal IgG2.
RESULTS: There were 18 patients (94.4% women) with subnormal IgG2. Mean age was
52 Â± 11 y. Upper/lower respiratory infection occurred in 94.4%/74.8%,
respectively. Autoimmune condition(s), atopy, other allergy, and frequent or
severe respiratory infection in first-degree relatives occurred in 44.4%, 44.4%, 
61.1%, and 22.2%, respectively. Median IgG2 was 105 mg/dL (83, 116). Subnormal
IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG4, IgA, and IgM was observed in 66.7%, 50.0%, 100.0%, 5.6%,
33.3%, and 0%, respectively. Lymphocyte subpopulations were normal in most
patients. HLA frequencies were similar in patients and controls. Three of 4
patients had no protective S. pneumoniae serotype-specific IgG levels before or
after PPSV23. These 18 patients represent 7.6% of 236 adults with IgGSD.
Prevalence of subnormal IgG, subnormal IgG3, and subnormal IgA was significantly 
greater in 18 adults with subnormal IgG2 than 218 adults without subnormal IgG2. 
Prevalence of subnormal IgM was significantly lower in patients with subnormal
IgG2.
CONCLUSIONS: Characteristics of adults with IgGSD with subnormal IgG2 include
female predominance, other immunologic abnormalities, subnormal IgG3 and/or IgG1,
lack of HLA-A and -B association, and suboptimal PPSV23 response.
