Surfaces formed by extracellular polymeric substances enclosing individual and
some small communities of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans on plates of hydrophobic
silicon and hydrophilic mica are analyzed by means of atomic force microscopy
imaging. Accurate nanoscale descriptions of such coverage surfaces are obtained. 
The good agreement with the predictions of a rather simple but realistic
theoretical model allows us to conclude that they correspond, indeed, to minimal 
area (constant mean curvature) surfaces enclosing a given volume associated with 
the encased bacteria. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first shape
characterization of the coverage formed by these biomolecules, with potential
applications to the study of biofilms.
