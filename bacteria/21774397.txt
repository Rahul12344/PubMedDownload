An efficient and inexpensive laboratory approach for the generation and the
purification of polyclonal antibodies to human antigen CD34 was developed. It was
shown that cloned refolded and purified from Escherichia coli recombinant
extracellular fragment of CD34 antigen retained immunogenic determinants of
cell-surface expressed CD34. Immunization of mice with unglycosylated truncated
recombinant protein elicit polyclonal antibodies specific for the native human
antigen CD34. The antibodies generated are applicable for phenotyping of CD34+
cells using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry assays.
