We used the autodisplay system AIDA-I, which belongs to the type V secretion
system (TVSS), to display the β-glucosidase BglC from Thermobifida fusca on the
outer membrane of the ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain MS04 (MG1655 ∆pflB,
∆adhE, ∆frdA, ∆xylFGH, ∆ldhA, PpflB::pdc (Zm)-adhB (Zm)). MS04 that was
transformed with the plasmid pAIDABglCRHis showed cellobiase activity (171
U/g(CDW)) and fermented 40 g/l cellobiose in mineral medium in 60 h with an
ethanol yield of 81 % of the theoretical maximum. Whole-cell protease treatment, 
SDS-PAGE, and Western-blot analysis demonstrated that BglC was attached to the
external surface of the outer membrane of MS04. When attached to the cells, BglC 
showed 93.3 % relative activity in the presence of 40 g/l ethanol and retained
100 % of its activity following 2 days of incubation at 37 °C with the same
ethanol concentration. This study shows the potential of the TVSS (AIDA-I) and
BglC as tools for the production of lignocellulosic bio-commodities.
