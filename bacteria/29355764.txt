The complement system is a significant component of innate immunity. Here, we
identified a Bf/C2 homolog (gcBf/C2b) in grass carp. gcBf/C2b shares a high
similarity with Bf/C2b counterparts in other teleosts. gcBf/C2b transcription was
widely distributed in different tissues, induced by Aeromonas hydrophila in vivo 
and in vitro, and affected by lipopolysaccharide and flagellin stimulation in
vitro. In cells over-expressing gcBf/C2b, transcript levels of all components
except gcC5 were significantly enhanced, and gcBf/C2b, gcIL1β, gcTNF-α, gcIFN,
gcCD59, gcC5aR1, and gcITGβ-2 were significantly upregulated after A. hydrophila 
challenge or stimulation with bacterial pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs). However, gcBf/C2b in interference cells down-regulated the transcript
levels after A. hydrophila challenge, and gcBf/C2b induced NF-κB signaling. These
findings indicate the vital role of gcBf/C2b in innate immunity in grass carp.
