Tolerance against self-antigens is regulated by a variety of cell types with
immunoregulatory properties, such as CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells. In many experimental models of autoimmunity, iNKT cells promote
self-tolerance and protect against autoimmunity. These findings are supported by 
studies with patients suffering from autoimmune diseases. Based on these studies,
the therapeutic potential of iNKT cells in autoimmunity has been explored. Many
of these studies have been performed with the potent iNKT cell agonist KRN7000 or
its structural variants. These findings have generated promising results in
several autoimmune diseases, although mechanisms by which iNKT cells modulate
autoimmunity remain incompletely understood. Here, we will review these
preclinical studies and discuss the prospects for translating their findings to
patients suffering from autoimmune diseases.
