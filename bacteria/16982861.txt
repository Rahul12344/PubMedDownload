CD3(-)CD4(+)CD45(+) inducer cells are required for the initiation of
mucosa-associated organogenesis of both nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissues
(NALT) and Peyer's patches (PP) in the aerodigestive tract. CXCL13(-/-) mice and 
mice carrying the paucity of lymph node T cell (plt) mutation and lacking
expression of CCL19 and CCL21 accumulate CD3(-)CD4(+)CD45(+) cells at the site of
NALT but not of PP genesis. Although NALT was observed to develop in adult
CXCL13(-/-) and plt/plt mice, the formation of germinal centers in CXCL13(-/-)
mice was affected, and their population of B cells was much lower than in the
NALT of CXCL13(+/-) mice. Similarly, fewer T cells were observed in the NALT of
plt/plt mice than in control mice. These findings indicate that the initiation of
NALT organogenesis is independent of CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21. However, the
expression of these lymphoid chemokines is essential for the maturation of NALT
microarchitecture.
