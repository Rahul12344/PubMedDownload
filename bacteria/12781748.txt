The availability of complete genomic sequence data allows one to develop new
methods of reconstructing phylogenetic trees. A simple method of reconstructing
branching orders based on gene transposition (or lateral transfer) is presented. 
It is argued that specific gene arrangements on four different genomes could
determine a branching order. A computer search for such gene arrangements was
carried out against gene order data of completely sequenced Gram-positive
bacteria. Gene arrangements around ribosomal protein S4 gene, murC
(UDP-N-acetylmuramate:alanine ligase) gene and dnaE (DNA polymerase III alpha
chain) gene each suggest a branching order in which actinobacteria with a high
genomic G+C content first branched off from other Gram-positives with a low G+C
content and then a split occurred between Mycoplasma species and a group closely 
related to Bacillus subtilis. A recently sequenced thermophilic bacterium
Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis is suggested to have branched off from the
lineage leading to the low G+C Gram-positives prior to the split between the
Mycoplasma and Bacillus groups. By contrast to the indel analysis in which a
single evolutionary event of insertion or deletion of a signature sequence is
assumed, the present method does not necessarily require such a parsimonious
assumption of gene transposition.
