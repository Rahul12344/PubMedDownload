BACKGROUND: Roles of cancer stem cells and early growth response gene 1 (Egr1) in
carcinogenesis have been extensively studied in lung cancer. However, the role of
Egr1 in the metastasis of lung cancer remains undetermined, especially in regard 
to stem cell-related pathways.
METHODS: Egr1, osteopontin (OPN) and Oct4 expression in human lung cancer was
determined by performing immunohistochemistry. Immunoblotting, ELISA, luciferase 
reporter assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and RT-PCR were performed to 
validate the regulation of Oct4-Egr1-OPN axis. Moreover, the effect of
Oct4-Egr1-OPN axis on lung cancer progression was evaluated by cell migration
assay and mice study.
RESULTS: We detected Oct4, Egr1, and OPN expression in clinical specimens from 79
lung cancer patients, including 72 adenocarcinomas and 7 squamous cell
carcinomas. High expression of Oct4, Egr1, and OPN accounted for 53, 51, and 57% 
of the patients, respectively. All of the three biomarkers were positively
correlated in clinical human lung cancer. Patients with high expression of OPN
were significantly associated with shorter disease-free survivals than those with
low expression of OPN (p < 0.05). In lung cancer cells, Oct4 transactivated the
Egr1 promoter and upregulated Egr1 expression. In a human lung cancer xenograft
model, Oct4-overexpressing tumors expressed elevated levels of Egr1. Furthermore,
overexpression of Oct4 in lung cancer cells increased the metastatic potential.
CONCLUSIONS: Egr1 exerts a promoting effect on cancer metastasis in
Oct4-overexpressing lung cancer. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting the
Oct4/Egr1/OPN axis may be further explored for the treatment of lung cancer,
especially when lung cancer is refractory to conventional treatment due to cancer
stem cells.
