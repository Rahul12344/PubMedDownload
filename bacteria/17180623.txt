Caspase activation and degradation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response
factors occur during in vitro T-cell proliferation, and an increased frequency of
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT)-negative variants have been
reported in conditions associated with in vivo T-cell proliferation. We have
applied two human somatic cell mutation reporter assays, for the HPRT and
phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) genes, to human T cells activated in 
vitro with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We demonstrate proliferation throughout 6
weeks of cultivation, and find that the frequency of variant cells phenotypically
negative for HPRT and PIG-A, respectively, increases from 10(-5) up to 10(-3)
-10(-2). We also report preliminary evidence for low-density CpG methylation in
the HPRT promoter suggesting that epigenetic modification may contribute to this 
markedly heightened rate of gene inactivation.
