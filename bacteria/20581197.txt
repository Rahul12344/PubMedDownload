In this study, a methylotrophic bacterium, Methylobacterium rhodesianum MB 126,
was used for the production of the chiral compound (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate (R-3HB) 
from methanol. R-3HB is formed during intracellular degradation of the storage
polymer (R)-3-polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Since the monomer R-3HB does not
accumulate under natural conditions, M. rhodesianum was genetically modified. The
gene (hbd) encoding the R-3HB-degrading enzyme, R-3HB dehydrogenase, was
inactivated in M. rhodesianum. The resulting hbd mutant still exhibited low
growth rates on R-3HB as the sole source of carbon and energy, indicating the
presence of alternative pathways for R-3HB utilization. Therefore, transposon
mutagenesis was carried out with the hbd mutant, and a double mutant unable to
grow on R-3HB was obtained. This mutant was shown to be defective in lipoic acid 
synthase (LipA), resulting in an incomplete citric acid cycle. Using the hbd lipA
mutant, we produced 3.2 to 3.5 mM R-3HB in batch and 27 mM (2,800 mg liter(-1))
in fed-batch cultures. This was achieved by sequences of cultivation conditions
initially favoring growth, then PHB accumulation, and finally PHB degradation.
