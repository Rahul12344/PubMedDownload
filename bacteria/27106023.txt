The pathogenic bacteria Clostridium botulinum and Bacillus anthracis produce the 
binary protein toxins C2 and lethal toxin (LT), respectively. These toxins
consist of a binding/transport (B7) component that delivers the separate enzyme
(A) component into the cytosol of target cells where it modifies its specific
substrate and causes cell death. The B7 components of C2 toxin and LT, C2IIa and 
PA63, respectively, are ring-shaped heptamers that bind to their cellular
receptors and form complexes with their A components C2I and lethal factor (LF), 
respectively. After receptor-mediated endocytosis of the toxin complexes, C2IIa
and PA63 insert into the membranes of acidified endosomes and form trans-membrane
pores through which C2I and LF translocate across endosomal membranes into the
cytosol. C2IIa and PA63 also form channels in planar bilayer membranes, and we
used this approach earlier to identify chloroquine as a potent blocker of C2IIa
and PA63 pores. Here, a series of chloroquine derivatives was investigated to
identify more efficient toxin inhibitors with less toxic side effects.
Chloroquine, primaquine, quinacrine, and fluphenazine blocked C2IIa and PA63
pores in planar lipid bilayers and in membranes of living epithelial cells and
macrophages, thereby preventing the pH-dependent membrane transport of the A
components into the cytosol and protecting cells from intoxication with C2 toxin 
and LT. These potent inhibitors of toxin entry underline the central role of the 
translocation pores for cellular uptake of binary bacterial toxins and as
relevant drug targets, and might be lead compounds for novel pharmacological
strategies against severe enteric diseases and anthrax.
