CC chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) attracts CC chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6)-expressing
cells. Using endoscopic biopsies taken from the gastric antrum of 42 subjects
infected with H. pylori and 42 uninfected subjects, mucosal CCL20 mRNA and
protein levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. CCL19 mRNA and protein levels,
as well as CCL21 mRNA levels, were also measured. The CCL20 mRNA and protein
levels were significantly elevated in H. pylori-positive patients and
substantially decreased after successful eradication. CCL19 and CCL21 expression 
levels were comparable in the H. pylori-infected and the uninfected groups. The
CCL20 concentrations correlated with the degree of chronic gastritis.
Immunohistochemistry and the in vitro infection assay showed that CCL20 was
principally produced by the gastric epithelium. CCR6-expressing cells, including 
CD45RO(+) memory T lymphocytes and fascin(+)-CD1a(+) immature dendritic cells,
infiltrated close to the CCL20-expressing epithelial cells. The CCL20/CCR6
interaction may be involved in the development of H. pylori-associated gastritis.
