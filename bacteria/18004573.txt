Data from recent animal experiments and clinical studies show that interleukin-17
(IL-17A, B, C, D, E, and F) plays an important role as proinflammatory cytokine
in the host response to extracellular bacteria and in chronic inflammatory and
autoimmune diseases. These findings have led to a revision of the well-known
T(H)1/T(H)2 hypothesis. In rheumatoid arthritis elevated IL-17 serum levels,
Th-17 cells in synovial fluid and in T-cell-rich areas of inflamed synovia are
found. In Wegener's granulomatosis, IL-17D is expressed in nasal granulomas. In
Crohn's disease IL-17 as well as IL-17 plus IFN-gamma producing CD4(+) T-cells
are detected in peripheral blood and inflamed intestinal mucosa. So far,
CD4(+)IL-17(+)IFN-gamma(+) T-cells have been described only in humans. These and 
other findings indicate a number of differences in the cytokine response between 
murine models and human beings.
