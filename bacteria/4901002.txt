Probes of DNA structure and interactions. Effects of copper II on
ultraviolet-induced pyrimidine dimer formation.

Sutherland BM, Sutherland JC.

Cu(II) affects the yield of cyclobutyl dimers induced in DNA by 254 nm radiation.
The effects are a function of r, the ratio of Cu(II) to DNA phosphate, and of the
ultraviolet (UV) fluence; they seem to reflect two types of copper complexes with
DNA. The first probably involves "exterior" binding to the bases of native DNA
and increases [unk]TT formation (without affecting [unk]UT yield) by raising the 
energy levels of bases other than thymine. The second seems to occur only at high
ratios (rs) and only after the structure has been opened locally by UV radiation;
it involves "interior" binding of Cu(II) to the bases. This complex tends to
decrease dimer yield by holding the bases apart and/or by lowering the energy
levels of bases other than thymine. These results illustrate the potential use of
DNA photoproducts and ligands to probe the structure and interactions of DNA in
vitro and perhaps also in vivo.
