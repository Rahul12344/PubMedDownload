The generation of an optimal humoral immune response requires fully activated
T-cells. For complete activation at least two signals are needed. The first one
is an antigen dependent one via the T cell receptor, the second one is a
costimulatory signal which can be delivered by the CD28 molecule after binding to
CD80 (B7.1) or CD86 (B7.2). Fully activated T helper cells are competent to
deliver help to B-cells by secreting cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL)-4) or
up-regulating CD40 ligand for proliferation and differentiation of B cells. These
interactions mainly take place in germinal centres (GC) that arise after antigen 
stimulation in B cell-follicles of peripheral lymphatic tissues and are the sites
of massive B-cell proliferation, affinity maturation and class switch. The roles 
of CD28 and IL-4 were investigated in GC formation and antibody production. A
markedly diminished humoral immune response was observed in IL-4(-/-) xCD28(-/-) 
mice whereas in CD28(-/-) and IL-4(-/-) mice the defect was less severe.
Especially the formation of germinal centres was significantly reduced in
CD28(-/-) or IL-4(-/-) mice and almost undetectable in IL-4(-/-) xCD28(-/-) mice.
Taken together these data indicate that CD28 and IL-4 are synergistically
involved in GC formation and immunoglobulin production.
