OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare concentration of
selected human beta-defensins (hBD-1, hBD-2) in cervico-vaginal lavage (CVL),
obtained from women with candidiasis, chlamydiasis and other bacterial
infections.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: beta-defensins were detected quantitatively by RT-PCR (7000
Taqman, Applied Biosystems) in cervico-vaginal lavage collected from 120 (79
women in the study group and 41 controls) non-pregnant women, aged 18-40 (mean
age 28.5 +/- 6.29). The study group patients were divided into three subgroups on
the basis of clinical and microbiological diagnosis: women with candidiasis
(n=13); with chlamydiasis (n=13), and with other bacterial infections (n=12).
RESULTS: The highest count of hBD-1 RNA copies was found in women with bacterial 
infections and candidiasis (335.84 and 320.10 respectively), and hBD-2--with
chlamydiasis. The difference between RNA copies of hBD-1/microg in candidiasis,
chlamydiasis and bacterial pathogens was statistically significant; for hBD-2
only in case of chlamydiasis.
CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia trachomatis infection activates the production of hBD-2.
Candida albicans, Chlamydia trachomatis, and bacterial pathogens induced variable
increases of hBD-1 concentration.
