BACKGROUND: High on-aspirin treatment platelets reactivity (HPR) is a significant
problem in long-term secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. We
hypothesize that imbalance between platelets MMPs/TIMPs results in cardiovascular
disorders. We also explored whether chronically elevated blood glucose affects
MMP-2/TIMP-4 release from platelets.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy patients with stable coronary artery disease,
supplemented with aspirin, participated in this pilot study. The presence of HPR 
and/or diabetes mellitus was considered as the differentiating factor. Light
aggregometry, impedance aggregometry, and ELISA tests for TXB2, MMP-2, MMP-9, and
TIMP-4 were performed in serum, plasma, platelet-rich plasma, and platelets-poor 
plasma, as appropriate.
RESULTS: Aspirin-HPR did not affect plasma MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-4. Arachidonic 
acid-induced aggregation of platelets from aspirin-HPR patients did not lead to
increased release of MMP-2, MMP-9, and TIMP-4. Studying patients at the lowest
TXB2 serum concentration quartile revealed that high concentration of plasma
TIMP-4 and TIMP-4 negatively correlated with TXB2 and platelet aggregation.
Diabetics showed an increased plasma MMP-2 as well as an increased MMP-2 in
supernatants after platelet aggregation. However, diabetes mellitus did not
affect MMP-9 and TIMP-4.
CONCLUSION: Aspirin-HPR did not affect the translocation and release of MMPs and 
TIMP-4 from platelets. TIMP-4 may serve as a marker of TXA2-mediated platelet
aggregation. Chronically elevated plasma glucose increases plasma MMP-2, and HPR 
potentiates this phenomenon.
