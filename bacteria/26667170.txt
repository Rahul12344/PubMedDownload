Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall glycolipid, lipoarabinomannan, can inhibit
CD4(+) T cell activation by downregulating the phosphorylation of key proximal
TCR signaling molecules: Lck, CD3ζ, ZAP70, and LAT. Inhibition of proximal TCR
signaling can result in T cell anergy, in which T cells are inactivated following
an Ag encounter, yet remain viable and hyporesponsive. We tested whether
mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (LAM)-induced inhibition of CD4(+) T cell
activation resulted in CD4(+) T cell anergy. The presence of LAM during primary
stimulation of P25 TCR-transgenic murine CD4(+) T cells with M. tuberculosis
Ag85B peptide resulted in decreased proliferation and IL-2 production. P25
TCR-transgenic CD4(+) T cells primed in the presence of LAM also exhibited
decreased response upon restimulation with Ag85B. The T cell anergic state
persisted after the removal of LAM. Hyporesponsiveness to restimulation was not
due to apoptosis, generation of Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells, or inhibitory 
cytokines. Acquisition of the anergic phenotype correlated with upregulation of
gene related to anergy in lymphocytes (GRAIL) protein in CD4(+) T cells.
Inhibition of human CD4(+) T cell activation by LAM also was associated with
increased GRAIL expression. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GRAIL
before LAM treatment abrogated LAM-induced hyporesponsiveness. In addition,
exogenous IL-2 reversed defective proliferation by downregulating GRAIL
expression. These results demonstrate that LAM upregulates GRAIL to induce anergy
in Ag-reactive CD4(+) T cells. Induction of CD4(+) T cell anergy by LAM may
represent one mechanism by which M. tuberculosis evades T cell recognition.
