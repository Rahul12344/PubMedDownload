Naturally acquired iummunity against clinical malaria is slow to develop, taking 
years of repeated exposure to parasites to acquire sufficiently broad and potent 
antibody responses. Increasing evidence suggests that Plasmodium infection and
the resulting immune stimulation contribute to changes in the B cell compartment.
In particular, accumulation of atypical memory B cells (atMBCs) is common in
Plasmodium-exposed individuals. Similarities to B cell subsets present in other
acute and chronic disease settings have provided insight into the development and
potential function of these cells; however, their contribution to protection
against malaria is still poorly understood. Here, we discuss recent findings that
have increased our understanding of atMBCs and outline outstanding questions
related to their function and development in the protective immune response to
malaria.
