Despite the rising knowledge about ribosome function and structure and how
ribosomal subunits assemble in vitro in bacteria, the in vivo role of many
ribosomal proteins remains obscure both in pro- and eukaryotes. Our systematic
analysis of yeast ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) of the small subunit revealed
that most eukaryotic r-proteins fulfill different roles in ribosome biogenesis,
making them indispensable for growth. Different r-proteins control distinct steps
of nuclear and cytoplasmic pre-18S rRNA processing and, thus, ensure that only
properly assembled ribosomes become engaged in translation. Comparative analysis 
of dynamic and steady-state maturation assays revealed that several r-proteins
are required for efficient nuclear export of pre-18S rRNA, suggesting that they
form an interaction platform with the export machinery. In contrast, the presence
of other r-proteins is mainly required before nuclear export is initiated. Our
studies draw a correlation between the in vitro assembly, structural
localization, and in vivo function of r-proteins.
