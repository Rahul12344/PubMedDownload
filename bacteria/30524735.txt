Background: Faecal dysbiosis associated with the use of metformin has been
conceived as a favourable ("good") dysbiosis and that with intake of
non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) as unfavourable ("bad"). The study aimed to
construct an alternative dysbiosis index (ADI) for the separation of the
dysbioses into "good" and "bad", and to validate the ADI.
Methods: Subjects with morbid obesity were included. Use of NNS and drugs were
noted, IBS was classified according to the Rome III criteria and the severity
measured with the Irritable bowel severity scoring system (IBSSS). Faecal
dysbiosis was tested with GA-Map ™ Dysbiosis test (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo,
Norway). The result was given as Dysbiosis Index (DI) scores 1-5, score > 2
indicates dysbiosis. An ADI was constructed and validated in subjects with IBS at
another hospital.
Results: Seventy-six women and 14 men aged 44.7 years (SD 8.6) with BMI
41.8 kg/m2 (SD 3.6) were included. Dysbiosis was associated with the use of NNS
and metformin, but not with IBS or IBSSS. An ADI based on differences in 7
bacteria was positively and negatively associated with the "good" metformin
dysbiosis and the "bad" NNS dysbiosis respectively. The ADI was also negatively
associated with IBSSS (a "bad" dysbiosis). The negative associations between ADI 
and IBS and IBSS were confirmed in the validation group.
Conclusions: The new ADI, but not the DI, allowed separation of the "good" and
"bad" faecal dysbiosis. Rather than merely reporting dysbiosis and degrees of
dysbiosis, future diagnostic tests should distinguish between types of dysbiosis.
