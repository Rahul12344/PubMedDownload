A deoxyribonucleic acid probe assay (PACE 2, Gen-Probe, San Diego) was compared
with a standard tissue culture method for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis
endocervical infection in both asymptomatic and symptomatic women. The results of
the probe test were expressed as a ratio of relative light units of the specimen 
per relative light units of the cutoff recommended by the manufacturer. Samples
with sample/cutoff ratios near 1.0 were repeated until two or more consistent
ratios were obtained. A total of 426 specimens were obtained, with an overall
disease prevalence of 10.1%. Of the 426 specimens examined, seven (1.6%) were
near the cutoff and were retested. The results of 426 samples with matching
cultures indicated that the manufacturer's discrete cutoff was adequate for
results determination. The deoxyribonucleic acid probe test was essentially
equivalent to standard tissue culture in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and
positive and negative predictive values in a low-prevalence patient population.
