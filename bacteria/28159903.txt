Although CD31 expression on human thymocytes has been reported, a detailed
analysis of CD31 expression at various stages of T cell development in the human 
thymus is missing. In this study, we provide a global picture of the evolution of
CD31 expression from the CD34+ hematopoietic precursor to the CD45RA+ mature CD4+
and CD8+ single-positive (SP) T cells. Using nine-color flow cytometry, we show
that CD31 is highly expressed on CD34+ progenitors and stays high until the early
double-positive stage (CD3-CD4+CD8α+β-). After β-selection, CD31 expression
levels become low to undetectable. CD31 expression then increases and peaks on
CD3highCD4+CD8+ double-positive thymocytes. However, following positive
selection, CD31 expression differs dramatically between CD4+ and CD8+ lineages:
homogeneously high on CD8 SP but lower or negative on CD4 SP cells, including a
subset of CD45RA+CD31- mature CD4+ thymocytes. CD31 expression on TCRγδ
thymocytes is very similar to that of CD4 SP cells. Remarkably, there is a
substantial subset of semimature (CD45RA-) CD4 SP thymocytes that lack CD31
expression. Moreover, FOXP3+ and ICOS+ cells are overrepresented in this CD31-
subpopulation. Despite this CD31-CD45RA- subpopulation, most egress-capable
mature CD45RA+ CD4 SP thymocytes express CD31. The variations in CD31 expression 
appear to coincide with three major selection processes occurring during
thymopoiesis: β-selection, positive selection, and negative selection.
Considering the ability of CD31 to modulate the TCR's activation threshold via
the recruitment of tyrosine phosphatases, our results suggest a significant role 
for CD31 during T cell development.
