Antitumor T cells are subject to multiple mechanisms of negative regulation.
Recent findings that innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) regulate adaptive T cell
responses led us to examine the regulatory potential of ILCs in the context of
cancer. We identified a unique ILC population that inhibits tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) from high-grade serous tumors, defined their suppressive
capacity in vitro, and performed a comprehensive analysis of their phenotype.
Notably, the presence of this CD56+CD3- population in TIL cultures was associated
with reduced T cell numbers, and further functional studies demonstrated that
this population suppressed TIL expansion and altered TIL cytokine production.
Transcriptome analysis and phenotypic characterization determined that regulatory
CD56+CD3- cells exhibit low cytotoxic activity, produce IL-22, and have an
expression profile that overlaps with those of natural killer (NK) cells and
other ILCs. NKp46 was highly expressed by these cells, and addition of anti-NKp46
antibodies to TIL cultures abrogated the ability of these regulatory ILCs to
suppress T cell expansion. Notably, the presence of these regulatory ILCs in TIL 
cultures corresponded with a striking reduction in the time to disease
recurrence. These studies demonstrate that a previously uncharacterized ILC
population regulates the activity and expansion of tumor-associated T cells.
