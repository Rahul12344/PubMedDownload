One-month-old Chinook salmon fry from a cold-water hatchery were presented live
for euthanasia and necropsy. Gross lesions were emaciation in 90% of the fry and 
ascites and increased cutaneous pigmentation in the remaining 10%. A cause for
the emaciation was not determined. Histologically, the fry with ascites and
increased pigmentation had visceral mycosis with aerocystitis, myositis,
peritonitis, and dermatitis. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor, a rare human pathogen, 
was isolated and identified in tissue sections from affected fry.
