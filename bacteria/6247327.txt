Deoxyribonucleic acid sequence of araBAD promoter mutants of Escherichia coli.

Horwitz AH, Morandi C, Wilcox G.

The controlling site region for the araBAD operon is defined, in part, by two
classes of cis-acting constitutive mutations. The aralc mutations allow low-level
constitutive expression of ara-BAD in the absence of the positive regulatory
protein coded for by the araC gene, whereas the araXc mutations allow expression 
of araBAD in the absence of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate receptor protein. 
Six independently isolated aralc mutations and three independently isolated araXc
mutations were cloned onto the plasmid pBR322 using in vitro recombinant
deoxyribonucleic acid techniques and in vivo recombination between plasmid and
chromosomal deoxyribonucleic acid. The location of these mutations was determined
by deoxyribonucleic acid sequence analysis. All of the aralc mutations occurred
at position -35 within the araBAD promoter (+1 = messenger ribonucleic acid start
for araBAD) and resulted from an AT leads to GC transition. All of the araXc
mutations occurred at position -10 within the araBAD promoter and resulted from a
GC leads to AT transition. Models are presented to explain the mode of action of 
the aralc and araXc mutations.
