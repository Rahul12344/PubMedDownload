The past five years have led to a tremendous increase in our molecular
understanding of the mode of action of the anthrax toxin, one of the two main
virulence factors produced by Bacillus anthracis. The structures of each of the
three components of the toxin--lethal factor (LF), edema factor (EF) and
protective antigen (PA)--have been solved not only in their monomeric forms but, 
depending on the subunit, in a heptameric form, bound to their substrate,
co-factor or receptor. The endocytic route followed by the toxin has also been
unraveled and the enzymatic mechanisms of EF and LF elucidated.
