BACKGROUND: Trafficking and differentiation of naive CD4+ and regulatory T cells 
(Treg) within the lymph node (LN) are integral for tolerance induction. The LN is
comprised of stromal fibers that dictate lymphocyte migration and LN structure,
organization, and microanatomic domains. Distribution of the stromal fiber ER-TR7
changes within the LN after antigenic challenge, but the contributions of ER-TR7 
to the resulting immune response remain undefined. We hypothesized that these
stromal fiber structural changes affect T cell fate and subsequently allograft
survival.
METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were left naive (untreated) or made immune or tolerant
(donor-specific BALB/c splenocyte transfusion -/+ anti-CD40L monoclonal
antibody), or made tolerant and received anti-ER-TR7 monoclonal antibody.
Donor-specific T-cell migration was visualized by adoptive transfer of
carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester-labeled TEa T cell receptor
transgenic CD4+ cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed on LNs to detect
stromal fiber distribution, structure, CCL21 presence, and Treg and
donor-specific cell location relative to high endothelial venules (HEV). Naive,
tolerant, and tolerant + anti-ER-TR7 mice received BALB/c heterotopic cardiac
allografts and graft survival was monitored.
RESULTS: The ER-TR7 distribution changed after the induction of tolerance vs.
immunity. Treating tolerant mice with anti-ER-TR7 altered HEV basement membrane
structure and the distribution of CCL21 within the LN. These differences were
mirrored by changes in the migration of naive and Treg cells within and
surrounding the HEV. Anti-ER-TR7 prevented tolerance induction and resulted in
allograft inflammation and rejection.
CONCLUSIONS: These results identify ER-TR7 as an important component of LN
structure in tolerance and a direct target for immune modulation.
