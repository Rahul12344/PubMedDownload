OBJECTIVES: To characterize granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor
(CD114) expression in normal (n = 20), myelodysplastic (n = 34), and chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML; n = 5) bone marrow by flow cytometry.
METHODS: Clinical bone marrow samples were analyzed using
CD33/CD114/CD34/CD117/CD45. CD114 density (mean fluorescence intensity) and
cellular distribution were evaluated on early blasts (CD33-), late blasts
(CD33+), promyelocytes, and granulocytes.
RESULTS: Normal CD114 acquisition occurred on early blasts, peaked on
promyelocytes, and decreased on granulocytes. Forty percent of CD34+ blasts
expressed CD114 and one-third were early blasts. In myelodysplastic syndromes,
altered CD114 distribution was more informative than density changes. In CML,
CD114 density was significantly decreased on early blasts and expression was
essentially limited to late blasts. We observed a specific blast dysmaturation
pattern in CML involving CD33, CD34, and CD114 that was 83% sensitive and 100%
specific in initial diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: CD114 provides useful additional detail in phenotypic assessment of 
hematopoietic precursor maturation.
