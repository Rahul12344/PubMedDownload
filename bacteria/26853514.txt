The demand of a plasmid encoding human hepatocyte growth factor gene (pUDK-HGF)
in large quantities at high purity and concentration has increased for gene
therapy of critical limb ischemia (CLI) in clinical trials. In this article, we
produced pUDK-HGF in compliance with current good manufacturing practices at gram
scale. The process included a 50-L batch fermentation, continuous alkaline lysis,
and integrated three-step chromatography on Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, PlasmidSelect 
Xtra, and Source 15Q. The production process has been scaled up to yield
4.24 ± 0.41 g of pharmaceutical pUDK-HGF from 1.0 kg bacterial cell paste and the
overall yield reached range from 58.37 to 66.70%. The final pUDK-HGF product
exhibited high purity with supercoiled percentage of > 95.8% and undetectable
residual RNA, contaminated protein, and bacterial endotoxin. The phase I clinical
study indicates that intramuscular injection of pUDK-HGF is safe, well tolerated,
and may provide symptomatic relief to CLI patients. These results show that our
manufacturing process of pUDK-HGF is efficient in producing pharmaceutical-grade 
plasmid DNA and is safe for clinical applications.
