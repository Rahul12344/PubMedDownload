The mucosal immune system of the intestine is separated from a vast array of
microbes by a single layer of epithelial cells. Cues from the commensal
microflora are needed to maintain epithelial homeostasis, but the molecular and
cellular identities of these cues are unclear. Here we provide evidence that
signals from the commensal microflora contribute to the differentiation of a
lymphocyte population coexpressing stimulatory natural killer cell receptors and 
the transcription factor RORgammat that produced interleukin 22 (IL-22). The
emergence of these IL-22-producing RORgammathiNKp46+NK1.1(int) cells depended on 
RORgammat expression, which indicated that these cells may have been derived from
lymphoid tissue-inducer cells. IL-22 released by these cells promoted the
production of antimicrobial molecules important in the maintenance of mucosal
homeostasis.
