The bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) is a hereditary immunodeficiency resulting
from the absence of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) expression.
Considering the central role of MHCII molecules in the development and activation
of CD4(+) T cells, it is not surprising that the immune system of the patients is
severely impaired. BLS is the prototype of a "disease of gene regulation." The
affected genes encode RFXANK, RFX5, RFXAP, and CIITA, four regulatory factors
that are highly specific and essential for MHCII genes. The first three are
subunits of RFX, a trimeric complex that binds to all MHCII promoters. CIITA is a
non-DNA-binding coactivator that functions as the master control factor for MHCII
expression. The study of RFX and CIITA has made major contributions to our
comprehension of the molecular mechanisms controlling MHCII genes and has made
this system into a textbook model for the regulation of gene expression.
