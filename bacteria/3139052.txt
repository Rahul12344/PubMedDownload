Five strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and 4 strains of Lactobacillus ssp.
isolated from fresh meat contained between 1 and 5 plasmids ranging in Mr from
1.3 to 49 MDa. Plasmid-curing studies suggested that maltose utilization is
associated with a 49 MDa plasmid (pML291) in Lactobacillus sp. DB29 and 34.5 MDa 
plasmids in Lactobacillus ssp. DB27, DB28 and DB31. Restriction digestion of
pML291 and a putative plasmid deletion derivative, pML292, isolated from a
maltose negative mutant of DB29, generated common restriction fragments. Southern
blot DNA-DNA hybridization using pML 291 as a probe indicated that there is
strong homology between putative maltose plasmids.
