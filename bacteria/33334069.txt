Inflammatory colon diseases, which are a global health concern, include a variety
of gastrointestinal tract disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon
cancer. The pathogenesis of these colon disorders involves immune alterations
with the pronounced infiltration of innate and adaptive immune cells into the
intestines and the augmented expression of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokines
stimulated by commensal microbiota. Epidemiological studies during the past half 
century have shown that the proportion of obese people in a population is
associated with the incidence and pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tract
disorders. The advancement of understanding of the immunological basis of colon
disease has shown that adipocyte-derived biologically active substances
(adipokines) modulate the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in the
progress of intestinal inflammation. The biomedical significance in immunological
homeostasis of adipokines, including adiponectin, leptin, apelin and resistin, is
clear. In this review, we highlight the existing literature on the effect and
contribution of adipokines to the regulation of immunological homeostasis in
inflammatory colon diseases and discuss their crucial roles in disease etiology
and pathogenesis, as well as the implications of these results for new therapies 
in these disorders.
