Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia and invasive disease,
particularly, in the elderly. S. pneumoniae lung infection of aged mice is
associated with high bacterial burdens and detrimental inflammatory responses.
Macrophages can clear microorganisms and modulate inflammation through two
distinct lysosomal trafficking pathways that involve 1A/1B-light chain 3
(LC3)-marked organelles, canonical autophagy, and LC3-associated phagocytosis
(LAP). The S. pneumoniae pore-forming toxin pneumolysin (PLY) triggers an
autophagic response in nonphagocytic cells, but the role of LAP in macrophage
defense against S. pneumoniae or in age-related susceptibility to infection is
unexplored. We found that infection of murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) by PLY-producing S. pneumoniae triggered Atg5- and Atg7-dependent
recruitment of LC3 to S. pneumoniae-containing vesicles. The association of LC3
with S. pneumoniae-containing phagosomes required components specific for LAP,
such as Rubicon and the NADPH oxidase, but not factors, such as Ulk1, FIP200, or 
Atg14, required specifically for canonical autophagy. In addition, S. pneumoniae 
was sequestered within single-membrane compartments indicative of LAP.
Importantly, compared to BMDMs from young (2-mo-old) mice, BMDMs from aged (20-
to 22-mo-old) mice infected with S. pneumoniae were not only deficient in LAP and
bacterial killing, but also produced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Inhibition of LAP enhanced S. pneumoniae survival and cytokine responses in BMDMs
from young but not aged mice. Thus, LAP is an important innate immune defense
employed by BMDMs to control S. pneumoniae infection and concomitant
inflammation, one that diminishes with age and may contribute to age-related
susceptibility to this important pathogen.
