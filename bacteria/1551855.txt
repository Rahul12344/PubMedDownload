The gene encoding the proton-glutamate carrier (GltP) of Escherichia coli K-12
was sequenced, and the primary structure of the protein was analyzed. The
nucleotide sequence was found to differ in several aspects from the previously
published sequence (B. Wallace, Y. Yang, J. Hong, and D. Lum, J. Bacteriol.
172:3214-3220, 1990). The corrected open reading frame encodes a protein of 437
(instead of 395) amino acids. Hydropathy analysis predicts 12 membrane-spanning
alpha-helical regions. The complementary strand does contain an open reading
frame possibly encoding a highly hydrophilic polypeptide of 272 amino acids.
