Within the budding yeasts, the opportunistic pathogen Candida glabrata and other 
members of the Nakaseomyces clade have developed virulence traits independently
from C . albicans and C. auris To begin exploring the genetic basis of C.
glabrata virulence and its innate resistance to antifungals, we launched the
Hermes transposon from a plasmid and sequenced more than 500,000 different
semi-random insertions throughout the genome. With machine learning, we
identified 1278 protein-encoding genes (25% of total) that could not tolerate
transposon insertions and are likely essential for C. glabrata fitness in vitro
Interestingly, genes involved in mRNA splicing were less likely to be essential
in C. glabrata than their orthologs in S. cerevisiae, whereas the opposite is
true for genes involved in kinetochore function and chromosome segregation. When 
a pool of insertion mutants was challenged with the first-line antifungal
fluconazole, insertions in several known resistance genes (e.g., PDR1, CDR1,
PDR16, PDR17, UPC2A, DAP1, STV1) and 15 additional genes (including KGD1, KGD2,
YHR045W) became hypersensitive to fluconazole. Insertions in 200 other genes
conferred significant resistance to fluconazole, two-thirds of which function in 
mitochondria and likely down-regulate Pdr1 expression or function. Knockout
mutants of KGD2 and IDH2, which consume and generate alpha-ketoglutarate in
mitochondria, exhibited increased and decreased resistance to fluconazole through
a process that depended on Pdr1. These findings establish the utility of
transposon insertion profiling in forward genetic investigations of this
important pathogen of humans.
