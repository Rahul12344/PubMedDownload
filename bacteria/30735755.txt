HLA class I molecules are highly polymorphic cell surface proteins that trigger
immune responses by CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Most humans
express six different HLA class I proteins encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C 
genes. HLA class I molecules bind to peptide antigens and present these antigens 
to T cell receptors (TCR) of CD8+ T cells. HLA class I expression levels also
regulate NK cell activation. The presence of individual HLA class I genes is
linked to many different disease, transplantation and therapy outcomes. An
understanding of HLA class I expression and stability patterns is fundamentally
important towards a better understanding of the associations of HLA class I genes
with disease and treatment outcomes, and towards HLA class I targeting for
vaccine development. Quantitative flow cytometry allows for assessments of
variations in expression levels of HLA class I molecules in cells from a single
blood donor over time, as well as averaged measurements across donors for the
same allotype. Since all HLA class I molecules are structurally-related, cellular
measurements of the HLA class I expression levels and stabilities of individual
variants in human cells require careful choices of donors and antibodies, which
are discussed here.
