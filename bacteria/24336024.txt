Appendicitis represents a common and severe gastrointestinal illness in younger
individuals worldwide. The disease is characterized by an excessive inflammatory 
response and it is believed that bacterial overgrowth due to blockage of the
appendix lumen might be involved. Despite the high incidence, only limited data
on the pathophysiological changes exist; in particular, the innate immune
responses involved are largely unknown. Real-time PCR analysis of tissue samples 
from inflamed and normal appendices demonstrated differentially regulated
expression patterns of epithelial-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMP). The
α-defensins human neutrophil peptides 1-3, HD5 and HD6, as well as the two
β-defensins, human β-defensins (hBD)-2 and hBD-3, were up-regulated, whereas
hBD-1 was down-regulated in acute appendicitis. Expression of upstream regulators
of AMP expression, NOD-2 and TLRs 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and 10 was significantly
increased as detected by real-time PCR. Finally, we confirmed the involvement of 
the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-8, and detected characteristic
changes in microbial community composition in appendicitis tissue specimens by
16S rDNA based detection techniques. In this study, we demonstrate a differential
regulation of the innate immune system along with an altered bacterial diversity 
in acute appendicitis.
