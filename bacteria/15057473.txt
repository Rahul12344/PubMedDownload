We examined the antimicrobial effects of human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) on 17
species of oral streptococci to investigate the involvement of antimicrobial
peptide activity in oral microflora development and the clinical use of the
antimicrobial peptide for oral microflora control. Oral streptococci exhibit
diverse levels of susceptibility to human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2). Two major
cariogenic bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans ( S. mutans) and S. sobrinus, 
were found to be susceptible to the peptide, indicating that it is a potential
therapeutic agent for preventing dental caries. S. mitis exhibited the lowest
susceptibility to the peptide. S. mitis is a major indigenous bacterium in the
oral microflora, and our results suggest that it might possess a certain
resistance mechanism against hBD-2.
