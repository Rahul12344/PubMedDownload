The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) are publishing a new edition of the ESMO/ASCO Global
Curriculum (GC) thanks to contribution of 64 ESMO-appointed and 32 ASCO-appointed
authors. First published in 2004 and updated in 2010, the GC edition 2016 answers
to the need for updated recommendations for the training of physicians in medical
oncology by defining the standard to be fulfilled to qualify as medical
oncologists. At times of internationalisation of healthcare and increased
mobility of patients and physicians, the GC aims to provide state-of-the-art
cancer care to all patients wherever they live. Recent progress in the field of
cancer research has indeed resulted in diagnostic and therapeutic innovations
such as targeted therapies as a standard therapeutic approach or personalised
cancer medicine apart from the revival of immunotherapy, requiring specialised
training for medical oncology trainees. Thus, several new chapters on technical
contents such as molecular pathology, translational research or molecular imaging
and on conceptual attitudes towards human principles like genetic counselling or 
survivorship have been integrated in the GC. The GC edition 2016 consists of 12
sections with 17 subsections, 44 chapters and 35 subchapters, respectively.
Besides renewal in its contents, the GC underwent a principal formal change
taking into consideration modern didactic principles. It is presented in a
template-based format that subcategorises the detailed outcome requirements into 
learning objectives, awareness, knowledge and skills. Consecutive steps will be
those of harmonising and implementing teaching and assessment strategies.
