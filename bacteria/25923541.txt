We examined the effect of biochar on the water-soluble arsenic (As) concentration
and the extent of organochlorine degradation in a co-contaminated historic
sheep-dip soil during a 180-d glasshouse incubation experiment. Soil microbial
activity, bacterial community and structure diversity were also investigated.
Biochar made from willow feedstock (Salix sp) was pyrolysed at 350 or 550Â°C and
added to soil at rates of 10 g kg-1 and 20 g kg-1 (representing 30 t ha-1 and 60 
t ha-1). The isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH
(lindane), underwent 10-fold and 4-fold reductions in concentration as a function
of biochar treatment. Biochar also resulted in a significant reduction in soil
DDT levels (P < 0.01), and increased the DDE:DDT ratio. Soil microbial activity
was significantly increased (P < 0.01) under all biochar treatments after 60 days
of treatment compared to the control. 16S amplicon sequencing revealed that
biochar-amended soil contained more members of the Chryseobacterium,
Flavobacterium, Dyadobacter and Pseudomonadaceae which are known bioremediators
of hydrocarbons. We hypothesise that a recorded short-term reduction in the
soluble As concentration due to biochar amendment allowed native soil microbial
communities to overcome As-related stress. We propose that increased
microbiological activity (dehydrogenase activity) due to biochar amendment was
responsible for enhanced degradation of organochlorines in the soil. Biochar
therefore partially overcame the co-contaminant effect of As, allowing for
enhanced natural attenuation of organochlorines in soil.
