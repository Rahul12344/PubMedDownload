The antibiotic bacitracin (Bac) inhibits cell wall synthesis of gram-positive
bacteria. Here, we discovered a totally different activity of Bac: the
neutralization of bacterial exotoxins. Bac prevented intoxication of mammalian
cells with the binary enterotoxins Clostridium botulinum C2, C. perfringens ι, C.
difficile transferase (CDT), and Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin. The transport
(B) subunits of these toxins deliver their respective enzyme (A) subunits into
cells. Following endocytosis, the B subunits form pores in membranes of
endosomes, which mediate translocation of the A subunits into the cytosol. Bac
inhibited formation of such B pores in lipid bilayers in vitro and in living
cells, thereby preventing translocation of the A subunit into the cytosol. Bac
preserved the epithelial integrity of toxin-treated CaCo-2 monolayers, a model
for the human gut epithelium. In conclusion, Bac should be discussed as a
therapeutic option against infections with medically relevant toxin-producing
bacteria, including C. difficile and B. anthracis, because it inhibits bacterial 
growth and neutralizes the secreted toxins.-Schnell, L., Felix, I., Müller, B.,
