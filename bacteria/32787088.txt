Host-defense peptides have drawn significant attention as new drugs or drug
adjuvants to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we report the
development of cyclic derivatives of the immunomodulatory and antibiofilm innate 
defense regulator peptide (IDR)-1018 based on three different synthetic
strategies including head-to-tail cyclization (C1), side-chain-to-tail
cyclization (C2), and a disulfide bond cross-linkage (C3). The generated mimetics
showed enhanced proteolytic stability and reduced aggregation in vitro and in
vivo. The C2 derivative exhibited exceptional ability to suppress inflammation
and significantly reduce bacterial loads in a high-density Staphylococcus aureus 
murine skin infection model. The findings describe different routes to the
creation of enzymatically stable mimetics of IDR-1018 and identify a promising
new cyclic analogue against bacterial infections.
