BACKGROUND: We sought to characterise a refined rat model of respiratory
infection with P. aeruginosa over an acute time course and test the antibiotic
ciprofloxacin.
METHODS: Agar beads were prepared ± SPAN(®)80. Rats were inoculated with sterile 
agar beads or those containing 10(5) colony forming units (cfu) P. aeruginosa via
intra-tracheal dosing. Bacterial load and inflammatory parameters were measured.
RESULTS: Differing concentrations of SPAN(®) 80 modified median agar bead
diameter and reduced particle size distribution. Beads prepared with 0.01% v/v
SPAN(®)80 were evaluated in vivo. A stable lung infection up to 7 days post
infection was achieved and induced BALF neutrophilia 2 and 5 days post infection.
Ciprofloxacin (50mg/kg) significantly attenuated infection without affecting the 
inflammatory parameters measured.
CONCLUSION: SPAN(®) 80 can control the particle size and lung distribution of
agar beads and P. aeruginosa-embedded beads prepared with 0.01%v/v SPAN(®)80 can 
induce infection and inflammation over 7 days.
