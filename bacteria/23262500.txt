OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effects of HAART
initiation on CD4(+) T-cell repopulation and T-cell immune activation in rectal
and duodenal mucosa.
DESIGN: The effects of HAART on the gastrointestinal tract remain controversial, 
and studies have reached different conclusions regarding its effectiveness at
restoring mucosal CD4(+) T cells depending upon time of initiation, duration of
treatment and gastrointestinal tract region studied.
METHODS: We obtained blood, rectal biopsies and duodenal biopsies from 14
chronically infected individuals at baseline and at 4-9 months post-HAART
initiation. We examined CD4(+) T-cell frequencies in blood, rectum and duodenum
at both time points, and performed a detailed assessment of CD4(+) T-cell
phenotype, immune activation marker expression and HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell
responses in blood and rectal mucosa.
RESULTS: CD4(+) T-cell percentages increased significantly in blood, rectal and
duodenal mucosa after 4-9 months of HAART (P = 0.02, 0.0005, 0.0002), but
remained lower than in uninfected controls. HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses 
in blood and rectal mucosa declined following HAART initiation (P = 0.0015,
0.021). CD8(+) T-cell coexpression of CD38 and HLA-DR in blood and mucosa, as
well as plasma sCD14, declined significantly. CD28 expression on blood and
mucosal CD8(+) T cells increased, whereas programmed death receptor-1 expression 
on blood HIV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells decreased.
CONCLUSION: Within the first months of HAART, limited CD4(+) T-cell
reconstitution occurs in small and large intestinal mucosa. Nevertheless,
decreased immune activation and increased CD28 expression suggest rapid
immunological benefits of HAART despite incomplete CD4(+) T-cell reconstitution.
