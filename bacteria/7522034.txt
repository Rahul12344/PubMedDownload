The serine/threonine protein kinase NIMA of Aspergillus nidulans is required for 
entry into mitosis and may function in parallel to the universal mitotic inducer 
p34cdc2. Here, we report the isolation of complementary DNAs encoding Nek2 and
Nek3, two novel human protein kinases structurally related to NIMA. Sequence
comparisons revealed several unique features which may define a family of
NIMA-related protein kinases. Nek2 was chosen for further study since it
represents the closest known mammalian relative of NIMA. Chromosomal mapping of
the nek2 gene identified two independent loci on chromosomes 1 and 14, and
Northern blot analyses revealed the expression of two distinct mRNAs of
approximately 2.4 and 4.7 kilobases in all human cell lines examined. In HeLa
cells synchronized by both drug arrest and elutriation, a strikingly cell
cycle-dependent pattern of Nek2 expression could be observed; Nek2 protein was
almost undetectable during G1 but accumulated progressively throughout S,
reaching maximal levels in late G2. These observations demonstrate that Nek2
resembles Aspergillus NIMA, not only in its catalytic domain, but also in its
cell cycle-dependent expression. Hence, the human Nek2 protein kinase may also
function at the onset of mitosis.
