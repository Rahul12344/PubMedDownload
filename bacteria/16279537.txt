The generation of ripe dendrite cells (DC) of marrow origin was obtained with the
use of the vaccine Immunovac-BN-4, an immunomodulator of microbial origin, as
well as Klebsiella pneumoniae LPS and TNF-alpha, as ripening inducers. These
inducers equally led to the ripening of DC. The generation of ripe DC was
characterized by morphological, phenotypical and functional changes. The
immunophenotype of cells altered from CD34+, CD38-, CD40-, CD80-, CD86-, MHC I-, 
MHC II-, F4/80- to CD34-, CD38+, CD40+, CD80+, MHC I+, MHC II+, F4/ 80(low). In
parallel with the ripening of DC their phagocytic activity decreased. In culture 
medium with ripe DC the levels of such cytokines as IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12,
IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha significantly increased and the production of IL-4
decreased. The content of IL-2 and IL-10 remained unchanged.
