OBJECTIVES: Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous malignancy. Therefore, it is
difficult to find single predictive markers. Moreover, most studies focus on
either the immunohistochemical or molecular assessment of tumor tissues by
next-generation sequencing (NGS) or PCR, while a combination of
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR for tumor marker assessment might have the
strongest impact to predict outcome and select optimal therapies in real-world
application. We investigated the role of proliferation survivin/BIRC5 and
macrophage infiltration (CD68, MAC387, CLEVER-1) on the basis of molecular
subtypes of bladder cancer (KRT5, KRT20, ERBB2) to predict outcomes of adjuvant
treated muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients with regard to progression-free
survival (PFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used tissue microarrays (TMA) from n = 50 patients (38 
males, 12 female) with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. All patients had been
treated with radical cystectomy followed by adjuvant triple chemotherapy. Median 
follow-up time was 60.5 months. CD68, CLEVER-1, MAC387, and survivin protein were
detected by immunostaining and subsequent visual inspection. BIRC5, KRT5, KRT20, 
ERBB2, and CD68 mRNAs were detected by standardized RT-qPCR after tissue dot RNA 
extraction using a novel stamp technology. All these markers were evaluated in
three different centers of excellence.
RESULTS: Nuclear staining rather than cytoplasmic staining of survivin predicted 
DSS as a single marker with high levels of survivin being associated with better 
PFS and DSS upon adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.0138 and p = 0.001, respectively). 
These results were validated by the quantitation of BIRC5 mRNA by PCR (p = 0.0004
and p = 0.0508, respectively). Interestingly, nuclear staining of survivin
protein was positively associated with BIRC5 mRNA, while cytoplasmic staining was
inversely related, indicating that the translocation of survivin protein into the
nucleus occurred at a discrete, higher level of its mRNA. Combining
survivin/BIRC5 levels based on molecular subtype being assessed by KRT20
expression improved the predictive value, with tumors having low survivin/BIRC5
and KRT20 mRNA levels having the best survival (75% vs. 20% vs. 10% 5-year DSS, p
= 0.0005), and these values were independent of grading, node status, and tumor
stage in multivariate analysis (p = 0.0167). Macrophage infiltration dominated in
basal tumors and was inversely related with the luminal subtype marker gene
expression. The presence of macrophages in survivin-positive or ERBB2-positive
tumors was associated with worse DSS.
CONCLUSIONS: For muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients, the proliferative
activity as determined by the nuclear staining of survivin or RT-qPCR on the
basis of molecular subtype characteristics outperforms single marker detections
and single technology approaches. Infiltration by macrophages detected by IHC or 
PCR is associated with worse outcome in defined subsets of tumors. The
limitations of this study are the retrospective nature and the limited number of 
patients. However, the number of molecular markers has been restricted and based 
on predefined assumptions, which resulted in the dissection of muscle-invasive
disease into tumor-biological axes of high prognostic relevance, which warrant
further investigation and validation.
