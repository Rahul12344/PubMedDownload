Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb) and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the
host's immune response system, T cells play a critical role in mediating
protection against Mtb infection, but the role of CD8+ T cells is still
controversial. We evaluated the phenotypical characterization and cytotoxic
ability of CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry-based assay. Cytokine levels in serum
were measured by multiplex cytokine assay. Our data show that cells from TB
patients have an increased percentage of peripheral blood CD8+ αβ+ T (p = 0.02)
and CD56+ CD8+ T (p = 0.02) and a decreased frequency of NKG2D+ CD8+ T (p = 0.02)
compared with healthy donors. Unlike CD8+ T cells from healthy donors, CD8+ T
cells from TB patients exhibit greater cytotoxicity, mediated by HLA class I
molecules, on autologous monocytes in the presence of mycobacterial antigens
(p = 0.005). Finally, TB patients have a proinflammatory profile characterized by
serum high level of TNF-α (p = 0.02) and IL-8 (p = 0.0001), but, interestingly,
IL-4 (p = 0.002) was also increased compared with healthy donors. Our data show
evidence regarding the highly cytotoxic status of CD8+ T cells in Mtb infection. 
These cytotoxic cells restricted to HLA-A, B, and C could be used to optimize
strategies for designing new TB vaccines or for identifying markers of disease
progression.
