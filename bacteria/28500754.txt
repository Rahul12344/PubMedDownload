XRCC4 and DNA Ligase 4 (LIG4) form a tight complex that provides DNA ligase
activity for classical non-homologous end joining (the predominant DNA
double-strand break repair pathway in higher eukaryotes) and is stimulated by
XLF. Independently of LIG4, XLF also associates with XRCC4 to form filaments that
bridge DNA. These XRCC4/XLF complexes rapidly load and connect broken DNA,
thereby stimulating intermolecular ligation. XRCC4 and XLF both include
disordered C-terminal tails that are functionally dispensable in isolation but
are phosphorylated in response to DNA damage by DNA-PK and/or ATM. Here we
concomitantly modify the tails of XRCC4 and XLF by substituting fourteen
previously identified phosphorylation sites with either alanine or aspartate
residues. These phospho-blocking and -mimicking mutations impact both the
stability and DNA bridging capacity of XRCC4/XLF complexes, but without affecting
their ability to stimulate LIG4 activity. Implicit in this finding is that
phosphorylation may regulate DNA bridging by XRCC4/XLF filaments.
