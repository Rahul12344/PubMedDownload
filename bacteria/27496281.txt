Modifications of the bacterial ribosome regulate the function of the ribosome and
modulate its susceptibility to antibiotics. By modifying a highly conserved
adenosine A2503 in 23S rRNA, methylating enzyme Cfr confers resistance to a range
of ribosome-targeting antibiotics. The same adenosine is also methylated by RlmN,
an enzyme widely distributed among bacteria. While RlmN modifies C2, Cfr modifies
the C8 position of A2503. Shared nucleotide substrate and phylogenetic
relationship between RlmN and Cfr prompted us to investigate evolutionary origin 
of antibiotic resistance in this enzyme family. Using directed evolution of RlmN 
under antibiotic selection, we obtained RlmN variants that mediate low-level
resistance. Surprisingly, these variants confer resistance not through the
Cfr-like C8 methylation, but via inhibition of the endogenous RlmN C2 methylation
of A2503. Detection of RlmN inactivating mutations in clinical resistance
isolates suggests that the mechanism used by the in vitro evolved variants is
also relevant in a clinical setting. Additionally, as indicated by a phylogenetic
analysis, it appears that Cfr did not diverge from the RlmN family but from
another distinct family of predicted radical SAM methylating enzymes whose
function remains unknown.
