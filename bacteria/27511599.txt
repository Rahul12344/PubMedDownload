Natural(ly) fit: The X-ray crystal structure of the bacterial membrane protein
MraY in complex with its natural product inhibitor muraymycin D2 is discussed.
MraY catalyzes one of the membrane-associated steps in peptidoglycan biosynthesis
and, therefore, represents a promising target for novel antibiotics. Structural
insights derived from the protein-inhibitor complex might now pave the way for
the development of new antimicrobial drugs.
