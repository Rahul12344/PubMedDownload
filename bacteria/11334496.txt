The onset of autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes and multiple sclerosis
is often thought to be associated with infection. This has led to studies of
molecular mimicry between infectious agents and the self-antigens associated with
autoimmunity. Despite many claims, however, a single causative infectious agent
for autoimmunity has not been found. An alternative possibility is that many
infectious agents are capable of non-specifically enhancing the likelihood of an 
autoimmune attack. Here we show how infectious agents may activate
antigen-presenting cells leading to the activation of autoreactive T cells by
otherwise innocuous antigens. The mechanism of activation involves upregulation
of co-stimulatory molecules on the antigen-presenting cell resulting in a
lowering of the threshold required for activation. These results help explain how
diverse infectious agents could cause autoimmune disease in susceptible
individuals.
