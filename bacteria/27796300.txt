Despite the global impact of macrophage activation in vascular disease, the
underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we show, with global proteomic
analysis of macrophage cell lines treated with either IFNγ or IL-4, that PARP9
and PARP14 regulate macrophage activation. In primary macrophages, PARP9 and
PARP14 have opposing roles in macrophage activation. PARP14 silencing induces
pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1 phosphorylation in M(IFNγ) cells, whereas it
suppresses anti-inflammatory gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in M(IL-4)
cells. PARP9 silencing suppresses pro-inflammatory genes and STAT1
phosphorylation in M(IFNγ) cells. PARP14 induces ADP-ribosylation of STAT1, which
is suppressed by PARP9. Mutations at these ADP-ribosylation sites lead to
increased phosphorylation. Network analysis links PARP9-PARP14 with human
coronary artery disease. PARP14 deficiency in haematopoietic cells accelerates
the development and inflammatory burden of acute and chronic arterial lesions in 
mice. These findings suggest that PARP9 and PARP14 cross-regulate macrophage
activation.
