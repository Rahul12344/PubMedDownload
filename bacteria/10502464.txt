The tyrosine phosphatase YopH is an essential virulence effector of pathogenic
Yersinia spp. YopH, which is translocated from extracellularly located bacteria
into interacting target cells, blocks phagocytosis by professional phagocytes. We
show here that immunoprecipitation of YopH from lysates of J774 cells infected
with Y. pseudotuberculosis expressing an inactive form of YopH resulted in
co-precipitation of certain phosphotyrosine proteins. The association between the
inactive YopH and phosphotyrosine proteins in the 120 kDa range was rapid and
could be detected after 2 min of infection. The proteins were identified as the
docking proteins Cas and Fyn-binding protein (FYB). Upon infection of J774 cells 
with Y. pseudotuberculosis lacking YopH expression both of these proteins became 
tyrosine phosphorylated. Moreover, this infection caused recruitment of Cas to
peripheral focal complexes, and FYB was relocalized to areas surrounding these
structures. Both Cas and FYB became dephosphorylated upon infection with Y.
pseudotuberculosis expressing active YopH, and this was associated with
disruption of focal complexes. With regard to the previous identification of Cas 
and focal complexes as targets of YopH in HeLa cells, the present study supports 
an important role for these targets in a general mechanism of bacterial uptake.
