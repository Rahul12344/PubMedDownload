Covalent linkage of a bacterial polysaccharide to an immunogenic protein greatly 
enhances the carbohydrate's immunogenicity and induces polysaccharide-specific
B-cell memory in vivo. These findings have spurred the development of
glycoconjugate vaccines for serious bacterial infections. The specific
B-cell-T-cell interactions responsible for recruitment of T-cell help by
glycoconjugate vaccines are not well defined. We used mice deficient in molecules
critical for stimulatory, cognate B-cell-T-cell interactions to study how T cells
improve the immunogenicity of a glycoconjugate vaccine against group B
streptococcal disease. Isotype switching to immunoglobulin G (IgG) was abrogated 
in mice deficient in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen
(Ag)-T-cell receptor (TCR), B7-CD28, or CD40-CD40L interactions. However,
expression of either the B7-1 or the B7-2 molecule on antigen-presenting cells
was sufficient for optimal T-cell costimulation. T cells activated by the vaccine
also played a pivotal role in determining the magnitude of the IgM response to
the polysaccharide. Comparable results were obtained with pathway antagonists.
These data suggest that MHC class II Ag-TCR, B7-CD28, and CD40-CD40L interactions
are critical for immune responses to glycoconjugate vaccines in vivo.
