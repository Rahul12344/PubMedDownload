Multi drug resistance capacity for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-Mtb) demands
the profound need for developing new anti-tuberculosis drugs. The present work is
on Mtb-MurC ligase, which is an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of peptidoglycan,
a component of Mtb cell wall. In this paper the 3-D structure of Mtb-MurC has
been constructed using the templates 1GQQ and 1P31. Structural refinement and
energy minimization of the predicted Mtb-MurC ligase model has been carried out
by molecular dynamics. The streochemical check failures in the energy minimized
model have been evaluated through Procheck, Whatif ProSA, and Verify 3D. Further 
torsion angles for the side chains of amino acid residues of the developed model 
were determined using Predictor. Docking analysis of Mtb-MurC model with ligands 
and natural substrates enabled us to identify specific residues viz. Gly125,
Lys126, Arg331, and Arg332, within the Mtb-MurC binding pocket to play an
important role in ligand and substrate binding affinity and selectivity. The
availability of Mtb-MurC ligase built model, together with insights gained from
docking analysis will promote the rational design of potent and selective
Mtb-MurC ligase inhibitors as antituberculosis therapeutics.
