A new solventogenic bacterium, strain GT6, was isolated from standing water
sediment. 16S-rRNA gene analysis revealed that GT6 belongs to the heterogeneous
Clostridium tetanomorphum group of bacteria exhibiting 99% sequence identity with
C. tetanomorphum 4474(T). GT6 can utilize a wide range of carbohydrate substrates
including glucose, fructose, maltose, xylose and glycerol to produce mainly
n-butanol without any acetone. Additional products of GT6 metabolism were
ethanol, butyric acid, acetic acid, and trace amounts of 1,3-propanediol. Medium 
and substrate composition, and culture conditions such as pH and temperature
influenced product formation. The major fermentation product from glycerol was
n-butanol with a final concentration of up to 11.5 g/L. 3% (v/v) glycerol lead to
a total solvent concentration of 14 g/L within 72 h. Growth was not inhibited by 
glycerol concentrations as high as 15% (v/v). The solventogenesis genes crt, bcd,
etfA/B and hbd composing the bcs (butyryl-CoA synthesis) operon of C.
tetanomorphum GT6 were sequenced. They occur in a genomic arrangement identical
to those in other solventogenic clostridia. Furthermore, the sequence of a
potential regulator gene highly similar to that of the NADH-sensing Rex family of
regulatory genes was found upstream of the bcs operon. Potential binding sites
for Rex have been identified in the promoter region of the bcs operon of solvent 
producing clostridia as well as upstream of other genes involved in NADH
oxidation. This indicates a fundamental role of Rex in the regulation of
fermentation products in anaerobic, and especially in solventogenic bacteria.
