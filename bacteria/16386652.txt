We present two familial cases of complement factor 2 (C2) type I deficiency.
Probands had experienced severe pyogenic bacteria infections in childhood and had
undetectable levels of C2 and very low level of CH50. Both children were
homozygous for the deletion of 28 bp in exon 6 of the C2 gene. Human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) typing in family 1 had the commonly reported associations, but
family 2 demonstrated a new association of the mutated C2 gene to HLA-A*3101,
-Cw*0602, -B*1801, and -DRB1*0901. In addition, for the first time, the frequency
of the 28-bp deletion of C2 and its HLA haplotypic associations have been
analyzed in a sample of the Spanish population containing 790 haplotypes and 105 
phenotypes. Cw*0602 is frequently found in Spanish haplotypes linked to the C2
mutated gene instead of the commonly reported -Cw*1203. The presence of
heterozygous or homozygous individuals for the C2 deletion with low levels of IgD
in both families supports the existence of a putative dominant susceptibility
gene for IgD deficiency in haplotype HLA-B18, -S042, and -DR2. The frequency of
the C2 28-bp deletion in heterozygosis is 1.4% (gene frequency 0.007) in Spanish 
healthy controls, similar to that reported in other white populations.
