Mechanisms for human memory T cell differentiation and maintenance have largely
been inferred from studies of peripheral blood, though the majority of T cells
are found in lymphoid and mucosal sites. We present here a multidimensional,
quantitative analysis of human T cell compartmentalization and maintenance over
six decades of life in blood, lymphoid, and mucosal tissues obtained from 56
individual organ donors. Our results reveal that the distribution and tissue
residence of naive, central, and effector memory, and terminal effector subsets
is contingent on both their differentiation state and tissue localization.
Moreover, T cell homeostasis driven by cytokine or TCR-mediated signals is
different in CD4+ or CD8+ T cell lineages, varies with their differentiation
stage and tissue localization, and cannot be inferred from blood. Our data
provide an unprecedented spatial and temporal map of human T cell
compartmentalization and maintenance, supporting distinct pathways for human T
cell fate determination and homeostasis.
