We describe here the identification and characterization of two novel enzymes
belonging to the IlvD/EDD protein family, the D-xylonate dehydratase from
Caulobacter crescentus, Cc XyDHT, (EC 4.2.1.82), and the L-arabonate dehydratase 
from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii, Rl ArDHT (EC 4.2.1.25), that produce
the corresponding 2-keto-3-deoxy-sugar acids. There is only a very limited amount
of characterization data available on pentonate dehydratases, even though the
enzymes from these oxidative pathways have potential applications with plant
biomass pentose sugars. The two bacterial enzymes share 41 % amino acid sequence 
identity and were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli as homotetrameric 
proteins. Both dehydratases were shown to accept pentonate and hexonate sugar
acids as their substrates and require Mg(2+) for their activity. Cc XyDHT
displayed the highest activity on D-xylonate and D-gluconate, while Rl ArDHT
functioned best on D-fuconate, L-arabonate and D-galactonate. The configuration
of the OH groups at C2 and C3 position of the sugar acid were shown to be
critical, and the C4 configuration also contributed substantially to the
substrate recognition. The two enzymes were also shown to contain an iron-sulphur
[Fe-S] cluster. Our phylogenetic analysis and mutagenesis studies demonstrated
that the three conserved cysteine residues in the aldonic acid dehydratase group 
of IlvD/EDD family members, those of C60, C128 and C201 in Cc XyDHT, and of C59, 
C127 and C200 in Rl ArDHT, are needed for coordination of the [Fe-S] cluster. The
iron-sulphur cluster was shown to be crucial for the catalytic activity (kcat)
but not for the substrate binding (Km) of the two pentonate dehydratases.
