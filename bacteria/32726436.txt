DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) is employed by eukaryotic cells to bypass
replication-blocking lesions induced by DNA-damaging agents. In budding yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DDT is mediated by RAD6 epistatic group genes and the
central event for DDT is sequential ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen (PCNA), a DNA clamp required for replication and DNA repair. DDT consists
of two parallel pathways: error-prone DDT is mediated by PCNA monoubiquitination,
which recruits translesion synthesis DNA polymerases to bypass lesions with
decreased fidelity; and error-free DDT is mediated by K63-linked
polyubiquitination of PCNA at the same residue of monoubiquitination, which
facilitates homologous recombination-mediated template switch. Interestingly, the
same PCNA residue is also subjected to sumoylation, which leads to inhibition of 
unwanted recombination at replication forks. All three types of PCNA
posttranslational modifications require dedicated conjugating and ligation
enzymes, and these enzymes are highly conserved in eukaryotes, from yeast to
human.
