The initiation of protein synthesis uses initiation factor 2 (IF2) in prokaryotes
and a related protein named eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (eIF5B) in
eukaryotes. IF2 is a GTPase that positions the initiator tRNA on the 30S
ribosomal initiation complex and stimulates its assembly to the 50S ribosomal
subunit to make the 70S ribosome. The 3.1-Ã… resolution X-ray crystal structures
of the full-length Thermus thermophilus apo IF2 and its complex with GDP
presented here exhibit two different conformations (all of its domains except C2 
domain are visible). Unlike all other translational GTPases, IF2 does not have an
effecter domain that stably contacts the switch II region of the GTPase domain.
The domain organization of IF2 is inconsistent with the "articulated lever"
mechanism of communication between the GTPase and initiator tRNA binding domains 
that has been proposed for eIF5B. Previous cryo-electron microscopy
reconstructions, NMR experiments, and this structure show that IF2 transitions
from being flexible in solution to an extended conformation when interacting with
ribosomal complexes.
