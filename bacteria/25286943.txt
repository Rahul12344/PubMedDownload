Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is one of the most important enzymes in the
glycolytic pathway and catalyzes the reversible cleavage of
fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate. The full-length fbaB gene encoding fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
aldolase class I (FBPA I) was cloned from Escherichia coli strain BL21. FBPA I
was overexpressed in E. coli and purified. Biochemical analysis found that the
optimum reaction temperature of FBPA I is 330.5 K and that the enzyme has a high 
temperature tolerance. Crystals of recombinant FBPA I were obtained by the
sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique in a condition consisting of 19 mg ml(-1)
FBPA I in 0.1 M Tris pH 9.0, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 and diffracted to 
2.0 Å resolution. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with
unit-cell parameters a = 217.7, b = 114.9, c = 183.9 Å, β = 124.6°. The
asymmetric unit of these crystals may contain ten molecules, giving a Matthews
coefficient of 2.48 Å(3) Da(-1) and a solvent content of 50.5%.
