Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors exhibit impressive
cardio-renal benefits in patients with a high cardiovascular risk. Genital yeast 
infections are important side effects of this class of drugs. We report a case of
Candida glabrata sepsis secondary to a Candida infection of the urostomy of a
patient on SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. In urostomy patients, one should critically
evaluate the risk of mycotic infections against the cardiovascular and glycaemic 
benefits of SGLT2 inhibition. Urostomy patients without a high cardiovascular
risk should not be treated with SGLT2 inhibitors.
