Phenylethanoids, including 2-phenylethanol, tyrosol, and salidroside are a group 
of phenolic compounds with a C6-C2 carbon skeleton synthesized by plants.
Phenylethanoids display a variety of biological activities, including
antibacterial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anti-asthmatic
activities. Recently, successful microbial synthesis of phenylethanoids through
metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches has been reported and
could allow phenylethanoid production from alternative microbial sources. Here,
we review the recent achievements in the synthesis of phenylethanoids by
microorganisms. The work done so far will contribute to the production of diverse
phenylethanoids using various microbial systems and facilitate exploration of
further diverse biological activities of phenylethanoids.
