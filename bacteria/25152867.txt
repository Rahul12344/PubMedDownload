Regulatory T (Treg) cells are essential for normal immune surveillance systems,
and their dysfunction leads to development of diseases, such as autoimmune
disorders. CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells are well-known suppressive cells, which
express the transcription factor Foxp3, are indispensable for the maintenance of 
immune self-tolerance and homeostasis by suppressing aberrant or excessive immune
response. Other Foxp3(-) Treg cells include Tr1, Th3, CD8(+)CD28(-/-), and
Qa1-restricted T cells; however, the contribution of these Treg cells to
self-tolerance, immune homeostasis as well as preventing autoimmunity is not well
defined. Here, we discuss the phenotypes and function of Foxp3(+) Treg cells and 
the potential use of such Treg cells against rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of note, 
even though most expanded populations of Foxp3(+) Treg cells exhibit suppressive 
activity, tissue-associated or antigen-specific Treg cells appear superior in
suppressing local autoimmune disorders such as RA. In addition, utilizing
tissue-associated Foxp3(+) Treg cells from stem cells may stable Foxp3 expression
and avoid induction of a potentially detrimental systemic immunosuppression.
