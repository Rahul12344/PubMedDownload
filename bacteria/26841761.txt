RNA helicases are indispensable for all organisms in each domain of life and have
implications in numerous cellular processes. The DEAH-box RNA helicase Prp43 is
involved in pre-mRNA splicing as well as rRNA maturation. Here, the crystal
structure of Chaetomium thermophilum Prp43 at 2.9 Å resolution is revealed.
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Prp43 from C. thermophilum is capable of
functionally replacing its orthologue from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in
spliceosomal disassembly assays.
