CD73 (5'-ectonucleotidase) is expressed by two distinct mouse CD4 T cell
populations: CD25+ (FoxP3+) T regulatory (Treg) cells that suppress T cell
proliferation but do not secrete IL-2, and CD25- uncommitted primed precursor Th 
(Thpp) cells that secrete IL-2 but do not suppress in standard Treg suppressor
assays. CD73 on both Treg and Thpp cells converted extracellular 5'-AMP to
adenosine. Adenosine suppressed proliferation and cytokine secretion of Th1 and
Th2 effector cells, even when target cells were activated by anti-CD3 and
anti-CD28. This represents an additional suppressive mechanism of Treg cells and 
a previously unrecognized suppressive activity of Thpp cells. Infiltration of
either Treg or Thpp cells at inflammatory sites could potentially convert 5'-AMP 
generated by neutrophils or dying cells into the anti-inflammatory mediator
adenosine, thus dampening excessive immune reactions.
