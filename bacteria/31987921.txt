Mitochondrial Lon is a chaperone protein whose upregulation increases the
production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, there is a
lack of information in detail on how mitochondrial Lon regulates cancer
metastasis through ROS production in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Our
results show that elevated Lon promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
via ROS-dependent p38 and NF-κB-signaling. We further identified
pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) as a client of chaperone Lon, which
induces mitochondrial ROS and EMT by Lon. Mitochondrial Lon induces ROS-dependent
production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF-β, IL-6, IL-13, and VEGF-A,
which consequently activates EMT, angiogenesis, and M2 macrophage polarization.
In addition, Lon expression is induced upon the activation and M2 polarization of
macrophages, which further promotes M2 macrophages to enhance the
immunosuppressive microenvironment and metastatic behaviors in the TME. This
raises the possibility that manipulation of the mitochondrial redox balance in
the TME may serve as a therapeutic strategy to improve T cell function in cancer 
immunotherapy.
