A homogeneous monomeric laccase (ASL) from Agaricus sinodeliciosus, with a
molecular mass of 65 kDa, was isolated using ion-exchange chromatography
(CM-cellulose and Q-Sepharose) and gel-filtration chromatography (Superdex 75).
This laccase exhibited maximum activity at 50 °C and pH 5.0. Hg2+ and Cd2+
significantly inhibited its activity. The laccase displayed a Km value of 0.9 mM 
toward 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). In addition to
ABTS, ASL exhibited higher affinity toward o-toluidine and benzidine than other
substrates. ASL is able to decolorize malachite green and Eriochrome black T.
