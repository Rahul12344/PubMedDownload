Genetic factors are implicated in the response of normal subjects to hepatitis B 
vaccine. In order to investigate the immunogenetic factors associated with
nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine, 93 health care workers were vaccinated 
with hepatitis B vaccine. Initial nonresponders (antibody not detected or
antibody detected but < 10 mlU/ml) were revaccinated. Only 12 (12.9%) of the 93
health care workers, who had anti-HBs levels of 10 mlU/ml or less after
revaccination were defined as absolute nonresponders. HLA typing were performed
in these 12 nonresponders, Anti-HBs levels were determined by ELISA method in
mlU/ml units. HLA-A,B,C,DR, and DQ typing was performed using the
microcytotoxicity test. The HLA-A10 (pc less than 0.01) and CW4 (pc less than
0.006) were decreased whereas DR7 (pc less than 0.09) was increased in
nonresponders. Although our initial results suggest the importance of genetic
modulation of responsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine, a formal demonstration of
the mode of inheritance of unresponsiveness to hepatitis B vaccine and the
explanation of the role of genes in this matter will require further studies of
families.
