Members of actinobacterial genus Streptomyces possess a sophisticated life cycle 
and are the deepest source of bioactive secondary metabolites. Although
morphogenesis and secondary metabolism are subject to transcriptional
co-regulation, streptomycetes employ an additional mechanism to initiate the
aforementioned processes. This mechanism is based on delayed translation of rare 
leucyl codon UUA by the only cognate tRNALeu UAA (encoded by bldA). The
bldA-based genetic switch is an extensively documented example of translational
regulation in Streptomyces. Yet, after five decades since the discovery of bldA, 
factors that shape its function and peculiar conditionality remained elusive.
Here we address the hypothesis that post-transcriptional tRNA modifications play 
a role in tRNA-based mechanisms of translational control in Streptomyces.
Particularly, we studied two Streptomyces albus J1074 genes, XNR_1074 (miaA) and 
XNR_1078 (miaB), encoding tRNA (adenosine(37)-N6)-dimethylallyltransferase and
tRNA (N6-isopentenyl adenosine(37)-C2)-methylthiotransferase respectively. These 
enzymes produce, in a sequential manner, a hypermodified ms2 i6 A37 residue in
most of the A36-A37-containing tRNAs. We show that miaB and especially miaA null 
mutant of S. albus possess altered morphogenesis and secondary metabolism. We
provide genetic evidence that miaA deficiency impacts translational level of gene
expression, most likely through impaired decoding of codons UXX and UUA in
particular.
