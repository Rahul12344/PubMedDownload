In the present study, the antibacterial activity of several ent-labdane
derivatives of salvic acid (7α-hydroxy-8(17)-ent-labden-15-oic acid) was
evaluated in vitro against the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli and the
Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. For all of the 
compounds, the antibacterial activity was expressed as the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) in liquid media and minimum inhibitory amount (MIA) in solid 
media. Structure activity relationships (SAR) were employed to correlate the
effect of the calculated lipophilicity parameters (logPow) on the inhibitory
activity. Employing a phospholipidic bilayer (POPG) as a bacterial membrane
model, ent-labdane-membrane interactions were simulated utilizing docking
studies. The results indicate that (i) the presence of a carboxylic acid in the
C-15 position, which acted as a hydrogen-bond donor (HBD), was essential for the 
antibacterial activity of the ent-labdanes; (ii) an increase in the length of the
acylated chain at the C-7 position improved the antibacterial activity until an
optimum length of five carbon atoms was reached; (iii) an increase in the length 
of the acylated chain by more than five carbon atoms resulted in a dramatic
decrease in activity, which completely disappeared in acyl chains of more than
nine carbon atoms; and (iv) the structural factors described above, including one
HBD at C-15 and a hexanoyloxi moiety at C-7, had a good fit to a specific
lipophilic range and antibacterial activity. The lipophilicity parameter has a
predictive characteristic feature on the antibacterial activity of this class of 
compounds, to be considered in the design of new biologically active molecules.
