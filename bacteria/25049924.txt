Influence of Yeast Fermented Cassava Chip Protein (YEFECAP) and Roughage to
Concentrate Ratio on Ruminal Fermentation and Microorganisms Using In vitro Gas
Production Technique.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein sources and
roughage (R) to concentrate (C) ratio on in vitro fermentation parameters using a
gas production technique. The experimental design was a 2Ã—5 factorial arrangement
in a completely randomized design (CRD). Factor A was 2 levels of protein sources
yeast fermented cassava chip protein (YEFECAP) and soybean meal (SBM) and factor 
B was 5 levels of roughage to concentrate (R:C) ratio at 80:20, 60:40, 40:60,
20:80, and 0:100, respectively. Rice straw was used as a roughage source. It was 
found that gas production from the insoluble fraction (b) of YEFECAP supplemented
group was significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in SBM supplemented group.
Moreover, the intercept value (a), gas production from the insoluble fraction
(b), gas production rate constants for the insoluble fraction (c), potential
extent of gas production (a+b) and cumulative gas production at 96 h were
influenced (p<0.01) by R:C ratio. In addition, protein source had no effect
(p>0.05) on ether in vitro digestibility of dry matter (IVDMD) and organic
(IVOMD) while R:C ratio affected the IVDMD and IVOMD (p<0.01). Moreover, YEFECAP 
supplanted group showed a significantly increased (p<0.05) total VFA and C3 while
C2, C2:C3 and CH4 production were decreased when compared with SBM supplemented
group. In addition, a decreasing R:C ratio had a significant effect (p<0.05) on
increasing total VFA, C3 and NH3-N, but decreasing the C2, C2:C3 and CH4
production (p<0.01). Furthermore, total bacteria, Fibrobacter succinogenes,
Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Ruminococcus albus populations in YEFECAP
supplemented group were significantly higher (p<0.05) than those in the SBM
supplemented group while fungal zoospores, methanogens and protozoal population
remained unchanged (p>0.05) as compared between the two sources of protein.
Moreover, fungal zoospores and total bacteria population were significantly
increased (p<0.01) while, F. succinogenes, R. flavefaciens, R. albus, methanogens
and protozoal population were decreased (p<0.01) with decreasing R:C ratio. In
conclusion, YEFECAP has a potential for use as a protein source for improving
rumen fermentation efficiency in ruminants.
