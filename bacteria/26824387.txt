HLA class I presentation of pathogen-derived peptide ligands is essential for
CD8+ T-cell recognition of Toxoplasma gondii infected cells. Currently, little
data exist pertaining to peptides that are presented after T. gondii infection.
Herein we purify HLA-A*02:01 complexes from T. gondii infected cells and
characterize the peptide ligands using LCMS. We identify 195 T. gondii encoded
ligands originating from both secreted and cytoplasmic proteins. Surprisingly, T.
gondii ligands are significantly longer than uninfected host ligands, and these
longer pathogen-derived peptides maintain a canonical N-terminal binding core yet
exhibit a C-terminal extension of 1-30 amino acids. Structural analysis
demonstrates that binding of extended peptides opens the HLA class I F' pocket,
allowing the C-terminal extension to protrude through one end of the binding
groove. In summary, we demonstrate that unrealized structural flexibility makes
MHC class I receptive to parasite-derived ligands that exhibit unique C-terminal 
peptide extensions.
