Activity of key-enzymes of C2-metabolism was determined in the cells of
strain-producer of surface-active substances Acinetobacter calcoaceticus K-4
grown on ethanol. It is shown that ethanol and acetaldehyde oxidation in the
strain K-4 is performed by pyroquinolinquinon (PQQ) and
4-nitroso-N,N-dimethylaniline (NDMA)-dependent dehydrogenases. Activity of
NDMA-dependent enzymes was maximum (100-300 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein) in
the early exponential growth phase of A. calcoaceticus K-4. Availability of
NDMA-dependent alcohol and acetaldehyde dehydrogenases in gram-negative bacteria 
was established for the first time. Acetate is involved in metabolism in the
strain K-4 with participation of both acetate kinase and acetate-KoA-synthetase; 
replenishment of the pool of C4-dicarbonic acids is performed in glioxylate cycle
(activity of isocytrate lyase is 600 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein) and in
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase reaction (1600 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein).
Both key enzymes of gluconeogenesis take place in synthesis of carbohydrates:
FEP-carboxykinase and FEP-synthetase (1200 and 4400 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of
protein, respectively). Enzymatic investigations have confirmed the capacity of
strain K-4 to synthesis of surface-active trehalosemycolates (activity of
trehalosephosphate synthase is 150-160 nmol min(-1) mg(-1) of protein).
