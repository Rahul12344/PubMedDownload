Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis.
Production of IFN-gamma is stimulated by synergistic effects of interleukin
(IL)-18, IL-12, and IL-15. To investigate the regulation of IFN-gamma production 
during severe gram-negative infection, the plasma concentrations of IFN-gamma,
IL-18, IL-12, and IL-15 were measured in 83 patients with suspected melioidosis. 
The diagnosis was confirmed in 62 patients, 31 of whom had blood cultures
positive for Burkholderia pseudomallei, of whom 12 died. Compared with healthy
controls, patients had elevated levels of IFN-gamma, IL-18, IL-12p40, and IL-15
on admission, with significantly higher levels in blood culture-positive
patients, and these levels remained elevated during the 72-h study period. In
whole blood stimulated with heat-killed B. pseudomallei, anti-IL-12 had a
stronger inhibitory effect than anti-IL-18 and anti-IL-15 on IFN-gamma
production. This effect of anti-IL-12 was further enhanced by anti-IL-18. These
data suggest that during gram-negative sepsis, IFN-gamma production is controlled
at least in part by endogenous IL-18, IL-12, and IL-15.
