Back-propagation neural networks were trained to recognize promoter sequences of 
each of the three major spacing classes found in E. coli. These networks were
trained with the object of maximizing their ability to generalize while
maintaining the level of false positive identifications at a fraction of 1
percent. These objectives were generally met. Networks for the 16 base spacing
class captured between 78 and 100% of previously unseen promoters in different
tests; networks for the 17 base class identified 97% of the test promoters;
networks for the 18 base class identified 79% of the test promoters. A tandem
poll of networks for all three spacing classes produced a cumulative false
positive level of less than 0.5%. In each case, the weight matrices used by the
networks in their classification were analyzed to determine the relative weight
assigned to the occurrence of a given base at a given position within the
promoter. In this fashion, an approximate description of the network's definition
of the promoter can be obtained.
