CONCLUSIONS: T cells in adenoid surface secretion (AdSS) possess the property of 
cytokine production and are mainly downregulatory or of Th1 type. These results
strengthen the hypothesis of an active immunological defense in AdSS.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, we demonstrated the presence of activated T cells in AdSS. 
The aims of this study were to elucidate the ability of these T cells to produce 
cytokines and to reveal their cytokine profile.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight children subjected to adenoidectomy were enrolled.
Samples of AdSS, adenoid tissue and peripheral blood were obtained, as well as a 
nasopharyngeal culture. T cells obtained from AdSS, adenoid tissue and peripheral
blood were then cultured and stimulated with anti-CD3 and -CD28 for 5 days. The
production of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and IL-2, -4,
-5 and -10 was then analyzed using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: All children had T cells in AdSS capable of cytokine production. T cells
in AdSS, adenoid tissue and peripheral blood samples from all children produced
IFN-gamma. Of the cytokines analyzed, IFN-gamma was produced in the highest
concentrations. In 6/8 children, T cells in AdSS also produced TNF-a and IL-10.
