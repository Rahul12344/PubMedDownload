Notch has a well-defined role in controlling cell fate decisions in the embryo
and the adult epidermis and immune systems, yet emerging evidence suggests Notch 
also directs non-cell-autonomous signalling in adult tissues. Here, we show that 
Notch1 works as a damage response signal. Epidermal Notch induces recruitment of 
immune cell subsets including RORγ(+) ILC3s into wounded dermis; RORγ(+) ILC3s
are potent sources of IL17F in wounds and control immunological and epidermal
cell responses. Mice deficient for RORγ(+) ILC3s heal wounds poorly resulting
from delayed epidermal proliferation and macrophage recruitment in a
CCL3-dependent process. Notch1 upregulates TNFα and the ILC3 recruitment
chemokines CCL20 and CXCL13. TNFα, as a Notch1 effector, directs ILC3
localization and rates of wound healing. Altogether these findings suggest that
Notch is a key stress/injury signal in skin epithelium driving innate immune cell
recruitment and normal skin tissue repair.
