OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate incorporation of polyacrylic acid
(PAA) coated copper iodide (CuI) nanoparticles into dental adhesives, and to
evaluate for the first time, their antibacterial properties, bond strength and
cytotoxicity.
METHODS: PAA-CuI nanoparticles were synthesized and incorporated into
commercially available adhesives Optibond XTR (1.0mg/ml) and XP Bond (0.5 and
1.0mg/ml). The antibacterial properties of experimental and control specimens
were evaluated (n=8), after ageing for 18h or 1 year, against Streptococcus
mutans (1×10(8)cells/ml). Bond strength to human dentine of the control and
experimental adhesives was evaluated by shear bond strength (n=10). For
cytotoxicity evaluation, HGF cells were cultured with gingival fibroblast media
and exposed to control and experimental adhesive blends (n=3). An MTT cell
viability assay was used to assess cell metabolic function. A one-way analysis of
variance followed by Tukey's test was used for data analysis.
RESULTS: Significantly greater antibacterial properties were demonstrated for
PAA-CuI containing adhesives after ageing for 18h or 1 year relative to all
control groups. A reduction in Streptococcus mutans viable cell count of 99.99%, 
99.99% and 79.65% was shown for XP Bond - 0.5mg/ml, XP Bond - 1.0mg/ml and
Optibond XTR - 1.0mg/ml PAA-CuI after ageing for 18h, and 99.99% for both XP Bond
- 0.5mg/ml and XP Bond - 1.0mg/ml PAA-CuI after ageing for 1 year. No significant
variations in shear bond strength or cytotoxicity were detected between the
experimental resins and their corresponding controls.
CONCLUSIONS: PAA-CuI nanoparticles are an effective additive to adhesive blends
as it renders them antibacterial without adversely affecting their bond strength 
or cytotoxicity.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The incorporation of PAA-coated copper iodide particles
into adhesive resins renders the adhesive antibacterial to S. mutans for at least
1 year in vitro. This may prevent or delay bacterial invasion and the consequent 
development of caries lesions if the adhesive interface becomes defective.
