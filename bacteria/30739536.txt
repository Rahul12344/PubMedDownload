Somatic mutations have been identified in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs)
in genes that include KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D. Based on independent
studies, there appears to be racial differences in the prevalence of somatic
KCNJ5 mutations, particularly between East Asians and Europeans. Despite the high
cardiovascular disease mortality of blacks, there have been no studies focusing
on somatic mutations in APAs in this population. In the present study, we
investigated genetic characteristics of APAs in blacks using a CYP11B2
(aldosterone synthase) immunohistochemistry-guided next-generation sequencing
approach. The adrenal glands with adrenocortical adenomas from 79 black patients 
with primary aldosteronism were studied. Seventy-three tumors from 69 adrenal
glands were confirmed to be APAs by CYP11B2 immunohistochemistry. Sixty-five of
73 APAs (89%) had somatic mutations in aldosterone-driver genes. Somatic CACNA1D 
mutations were the most prevalent genetic alteration (42%), followed by KCNJ5
(34%), ATP1A1 (8%), and ATP2B3 mutations (4%). CACNA1D mutations were more often 
observed in APAs from males than those from females (55% versus 29%, P=0.033),
whereas KCNJ5 mutations were more prevalent in APAs from females compared with
those from males (57% versus 13%, P<0.001). No somatic mutations in
aldosterone-driver genes were identified in tumors without CYP11B2 expression. In
conclusion, 89% of APAs in blacks harbor aldosterone-driving mutations, and
unlike Europeans and East Asians, the most frequently mutated aldosterone-driver 
gene was CACNA1D. Determination of racial differences in the prevalence of
aldosterone-driver gene mutations may facilitate the development of personalized 
medicines for patients with primary aldosteronism.
