Cancer-testis antigen MAGE-C2 is normally expressed in testis but aberrantly
expressed in various kinds of tumors. Its functions in tumor cells are mostly
unknown. Here, we show that MAGE-C2 binds directly to the RING domain protein
Rbx1, and participates in Skp1-Cullin1-F box protein (SCF) complex. Furthermore, 
MAGE-C2 can inhibit the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of SCF complex. Ablation of 
endogenous MAGE-C2 decreases the level of cyclin E and accelerates cyclin E
turnover by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. Overexpression 
of MAGE-C2 increases the level of cyclin E and promotes G1-S transition and cell 
proliferation, and the results are further confirmed by knockdown of MAGE-C2.
Overall, the study indicates that MAGE-C2 is involved in SCF complex and
increases the stability of cyclin E in tumor cells.
