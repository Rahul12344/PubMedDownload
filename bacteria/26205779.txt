Our laboratory established a role for poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) in
asthma. To increase the clinical significance of our studies, it is imperative to
demonstrate that PARP is actually activated in human asthma, to examine whether a
PARP inhibitor approved for human testing such as olaparib blocks
already-established chronic asthma traits in response to house dust mite (HDM), a
true human allergen, in mice and to examine whether the drug modulates human
cluster of differentiation type 4 (CD4(+)) T-cell function. To conduct the study,
human lung specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a
HDM-based mouse asthma model were used. Our results show that PARP is activated
in PBMCs and lung tissues of asthmatics. PARP inhibition by olaparib or gene
knockout blocked established asthma-like traits in mice chronically exposed to
HDM including airway eosinophilia and hyper-responsiveness. These effects were
linked to a marked reduction in T helper 2 (Th2) cytokine production without a
prominent effect on interferon (IFN)-γ or interleukin (IL)-10. PARP inhibition
prevented HDM-induced increase in overall cellularity, weight and CD4(+) T-cell
population in spleens of treated mice whereas it increased the T-regulatory cell 
population. In CD3/CD28-stimulated human CD4 (+)T-cells, olaparib treatment
reduced Th2 cytokine production potentially by modulating GATA binding protein-3 
(gata-3)/IL-4 expression while moderately affecting T-cell proliferation. PARP
inhibition inconsistently increased IL-17 in HDM-exposed mice and
CD3/CD28-stimulated CD4(+) T cells without a concomitant increase in factors that
can be influenced by IL-17. In the present study, we provide evidence for the
first time that PARP-1 is activated in human asthma and that its inhibition is
effective in blocking established asthma in mice.
