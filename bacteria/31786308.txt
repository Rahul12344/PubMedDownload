G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of cell-surface
receptors in humans and regulate numerous physiological processes through the
activation of heterotrimeric G proteins. GPCR kinases (GRKs) selectively
phosphorylate active GPCRs, which promotes arrestin binding, receptor
internalization, and initiation of alternative signaling pathways. GRK5 is a
representative member of one of three GRK subfamilies that does not need
post-translational lipidation or other binding partners to exhibit full activity 
against GPCRs, rendering it a useful tool for biophysical studies directed at
characterizing GRK function. However, recombinant expression of GRK5 has thus far
been limited to insect and mammalian systems. Here, we describe the expression of
functional GRK5 in E. coli and its purification and biochemical characterization.
Bacterially expressed GRK5 is hyperphosphorylated, primarily in regions known to 
be flexible from prior crystal structures, which slightly decreases its catalytic
activity toward receptor substrates. Mutation of a single phosphorylation site,
Thr10, restores kinetic parameters to those of GRK5 purified from insect cells.
Consequently, bacterial expression will allow for production of GRK5 at a reduced
cost and faster pace and would facilitate production of isotopically labeled
kinase for NMR studies or for the incorporation of unnatural amino acids.
