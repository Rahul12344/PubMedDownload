Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a specialized subset of T cells
contributing to both, the innate and adaptive immune responses. In contrast to
conventional T lymphocytes they recognize lipid antigens. The aim of the project 
is to establish a novel model system, to study iNKT-TCR - ligand interaction. An 
iNKT reporter cell line (JE6-1REP-iNKT) was engineered by introducing the human
iNKT-TCR into a human leukemic T cell line carrying an NF-κB-driven fluorescent
transcriptional reporter construct. Antigen presenting BWSTIM cells expressing
human CD1d and CD80 were generated. Reporter induction in JE6-1REP-iNKT cells was
assessed by flow cytometry. CRISPR/Cas9 was used for β2M knock out in
JE6-1REP-iNKT cells to abrogate CD1d expression and thus excluding antigen
self-presentation. Reporter cells were shown to specifically react with iNKT
antigens presented via CD1d. Their sensitivity towards α-GalCer was comparable to
a murine iNKT hybridoma cell line. In conclusion, we created a novel iNKT
reporter platform which, compared to traditional iNKT cell assays, is
characterized by a shorter turnaround time and lower costs. It thus facilitates
the identification of antigenic structures that drive the activation of iNKT
cells in health and disease.
