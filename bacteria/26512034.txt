Chlamydia trachomatis infections can result in the development of serious
sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal infertility. In this
study, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from women who were undergoing or had
recently undergone IVF treatment were cultured ex vivo with C. trachomatis to
identify the immune responses associated with women who had serological evidence 
of a history of Chlamydia infection. Cytokines secreted into the supernatant from
the cultures were measured using ELISA, and the level of IL-1β was found to be
significantly higher in Chlamydia positive women than Chlamydia negative women.
qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of 88 immune-related genes showed trends
towards an upregulation of CXCL10, CXCL11 and HLA-A in Chlamydia positive women
compared with Chlamydia negative women. These findings support that some women
launch a more marked proinflammatory response upon infection with C. trachomatis 
and this may be associated with why C. trachomatis induces infertility in some
infected women.
