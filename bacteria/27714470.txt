An increased knowledge on the real impacts of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis in forest
species is needed to optimize forest sustainable productivity and thus to improve
forest services and their capacity to act as carbon sinks. In this study, we
investigated the response of an oak species to ectomycorrhizae formation using a 
proteomics approach complemented by biochemical analysis of carbohydrate levels. 
Comparative proteome analysis between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal cork oak
plants revealed no differences at the foliar level. However, the protein profile 
of 34 unique oak proteins was altered in the roots. Consistent with the results
of the biochemical analysis, the proteome analysis of the mycorrhizal roots
suggests a decreasing utilization of sucrose for the metabolic activity of
mycorrhizal roots which is consistent with an increased allocation of
carbohydrates from the plant to the fungus in order to sustain the symbiosis. In 
addition, a promotion of protein unfolding mechanisms, attenuation of defense
reactions, increased nutrient mobilization from the plant-fungus interface (N and
P), as well as cytoskeleton rearrangements and induction of plant cell wall
loosening for fungal root accommodation in colonized roots are also suggested by 
the results. The suggested improvement in root capacity to take up nutrients
accompanied by an increase of root biomass without apparent changes in
aboveground biomass strongly re-enforces the potential of mycorrhizal inoculation
to improve cork oak forest resistance capacity to cope with coming climate
change.
