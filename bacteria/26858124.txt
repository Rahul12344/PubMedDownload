Limited cell numbers in umbilical cord blood (UCB) grafts present a major
impediment to favorable outcomes in adult transplantation, largely related to
delayed or failed engraftment. The advent of UCB transplantation (UCBT) using two
grafts successfully circumvents this obstacle, despite the engraftment of only
one unit. Preclinical models suggested that the addition of UCB T cells at the
time of transplant can enhance engraftment. We tested whether ex vivo activation 
by CD3/CD28 costimulation and expansion of T cells from a single UCB graft would 
be safe and feasible in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies, with an
overall objective of optimizing engraftment in single unit UCBT. In this phase 1 
study, recipients of single UCB units were eligible if the unit was stored in two
adequate fractions. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 or grade 4 GVHD
within 90 days of UCBT. Four patients underwent UCBT; all were treated at the
first dose level (10(5) cells/kg). At the 10(5) cells/kg dose level two subjects 
experienced grade 3 intestinal GVHD, thus meeting stopping criteria. For three
subjects, neutrophil engraftment was early (12, 17, and 20 days), while one
subject experienced primary graft failure. We observed early donor T cell
trafficking and found that expanded T cells produced supraphysiologic levels of
cytokines relevant to engraftment and to lymphoid differentiation and function.
Taken together, these preliminary data suggest rapid engraftment in recipients of
a single UCBT combined with relatively low doses of activated T cells, though
potentially complicated by severe GVHD.
