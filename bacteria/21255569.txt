In this study we examined the effect of T cell-derived cytokines on retinal
pigment epithelial (RPE) cells with respect to expression of complement
components. We used an in vitro co-culture system in which CD3/CD28-activated
human T cells were separated from the human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) by a
membrane. Differential gene expression in the RPE cells of complement factor
genes was identified using gene arrays, and selected gene transcripts were
validated by q-RT-PCR. Protein expression was determined by ELISA and
immunoblotting. Co-culture with activated T cells increased RPE mRNA and/or
protein expression of complement components C3, factors B, H, H-like 1, CD46,
CD55, CD59, and clusterin, in a dose-dependent manner. Soluble factors derived
from activated T cells are capable of increasing expression of complement
components in RPE cells. This is important for the further understanding of
inflammatory ocular diseases such as uveitis and age-related macular
degeneration.
