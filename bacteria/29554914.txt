BACKGROUND: In industries lipolytic reactions occur in insensitive conditions
such as high temperature thus novel stout esterases with unique properties are
attracts to the industrial application. Protein engineering is the tool to obtain
desirable characters of enzymes. A novel esterase gene was isolated from South
China Sea and subjected to a random mutagenesis and site directed mutagenesis for
higher activity and thermo-stability compared to wild type.
RESULTS: A novel esterase showed the highest hydrolytic activity against
p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA, C2) and the optimal activity at 40 °C and pH 8.5. It
was a cold-adapted enzyme and retained approximately 40% of its maximum activity 
at 0 °C. A mutant, with higher activity and thermo-stability was obtained by
random mutagenesis. Kinetic analysis indicated that the mutant Val29Ala/Tyr193Cys
shown 43.5% decrease in K m , 2.6-fold increase in K cat , and 4.7-fold increase 
in K cat /K m relative to the wild type. Single mutants V29A and Y193C were
constructed and their kinetic parameters were measured. The results showed that
the values of K m , K cat , and K cat /K m of V29A were similar to those of the
wild type while Y193C showed 52.7% decrease in K m , 2.7-fold increase in K cat ,
and 5.6-fold increase in K cat /K m compared with the wild type. The 3-D
structure and docking analysis revealed that the replacement of Tyr by Cys could 
enlarge the binding pocket. Moreover Y193C also showed a better thermo-stability 
for the reason its higher hydrophobicity and retained 67% relative activity after
incubation for 3 h at 50 °C.
CONCLUSIONS: The superior quality of modified esterase suggested it has great
potential application in extreme conditions and the mutational work recommended
that important information for the study of esterase structure and function.
