Samples of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) from the Southern Yellow 
Sea (SYS) and the East China Sea (ECS) were evaluated by fluorescent Excitation
Emission Matrix (EEM) combined with Parallel Factorial Analysis (PARAFAC). Three 
terrestrial humic-like components (C1, C2 and C3) and one autochthonous
protein-like component (C4) were identified. As for seasonal variations, CDOM
displayed the following order on the whole: summer>spring>autumn. The C1, C2 and 
C3 components were mainly dominated by terrestrial inputs and their spatial
distributions and temporal variations also can be influenced by primary
productivity of phytoplankton, microbial activities and photobleaching. C4 was
produced by phytoplankton and microorganisms and consumed by marine bacteria, and
besides its distribution was attributed to the influence of riverine inputs.
Terrestrial inputs were the dominant sources of CDOM in the SYS and ECS.
