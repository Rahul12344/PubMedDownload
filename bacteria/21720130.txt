When food safety is mentioned, people would think about food which is in
compliance with Food Sanitation Act and standard, and edible food. Because there 
is difference in terms of food and additives standards between Japan and other
countries, a variety of food cannot be imported from foreign countries to Japan. 
In addition, in 2006, with the introduction of the Positive List, which takes a
close-up of pesticide remained in food and anti-biotic, we adopted an effective
policy towards imported food which does not reach the national standards. On one 
hand, in order to ensure food safety, domestic producers, hotels, fast food
stores, and restaurants all try to strengthen management on food quality and
employees health. However, food poisoning happens frequently. Chemicals and
natural poisoning play a part but the major part is played by micro-organism
(bacteria). So it become more and more important to develop food safety policies 
to avoid harm from bad food. Therefore, as an authority with the responsibility
of quarantine, inspection and registration, it is important to conduct food
inspection and it is even more important to provide comprehensive suggestions.
