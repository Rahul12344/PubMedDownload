The translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein (Tarp) is injected into the
cytosol shortly after Chlamydia trachomatis attachment to a target cell and
subsequently phosphorylated by an unidentified tyrosine kinase. A role for Tarp
phosphorylation in bacterial entry is unknown. In this study, recombinant C.
trachomatis Tarp was employed to identify the host cell kinase(s) required for
phosphorylation. Each tyrosine rich repeat of L2 Tarp harbors a sequence similar 
to a Src and Abl kinase consensus target. Furthermore, purified p60-src, Yes,
Fyn, and Abl kinases were able to phosphorylate Tarp. Mutagenesis of potential
tyrosines within a single tyrosine rich repeat peptide indicated that both Src
and Abl kinases phosphorylate the same residues suggesting that C. trachomatis
Tarp may serve as a substrate for multiple host cell kinases. Surprisingly,
chemical inhibition of Src and Abl kinases prevented Tarp phosphorylation in
culture and had no measurable effect on bacterial entry into host cells.
