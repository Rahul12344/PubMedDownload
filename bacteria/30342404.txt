Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is not easily degraded in soils, which will
pose a threat to human health. We investigated the differences of eight
vegetables' capacity to take up DDT, removing DDT from soil, and tolerating DDT
(monitoring the responses of growth, root morphology and photosynthesis of
vegetables to DDT). These vegetables included Chinese mustard (two genotypes,
B.jf and B,jm), napa cabbage (two genotypes, B.coz and B.coc) and Bok choy (four 
genotypes, B.cz, B.cq, B.cs and B.chg). The results demonstrated that 5 mg kg-1
DDT did not display significant effects on the growth of most vegetables in this 
study. As compared to the control, 5 mg kg-1 DDT significantly increased the
shoot and root biomass, the fine root numbers, and the fine root ratio for the
genotype of B.chg. However, 5 mg kg-1 DDT exposure showed a negative effect on
the shoot growth of two genotypes of napa cabbage. In general, 5 mg kg-1 DDT did 
not significantly affect the photosynthesis and root morphology of most
vegetables in this study. Consuming these vegetables had a low non-cancer health 
risk, but showed a high cancer health risk. In addition, among the eight
vegetables, B.chg accumulated less DDT in the edible parts and had low values of 
HRnon-cancer and HRcancer for consuming these vegetables containing DDT. Planting
these vegetables might promote the degradation of DDT reducing its residual
amount in soil.
