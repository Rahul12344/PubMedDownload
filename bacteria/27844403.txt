BACKGROUND: Bone repair is initiated with a local inflammatory response to
injury. The presence of systemic inflammation impairs bone healing and often
leads to malunion, although the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. Our 
research objective was to use a mouse model of cortical bone repair to determine 
the effect of systemic inflammation on cells in the bone healing
microenvironment. QUESTION/PURPOSES: (1) Does systemic inflammation, induced by
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration affect the quantity and quality of
regenerating bone in primary bone healing? (2) Does systemic inflammation alter
vascularization and the number or activity of inflammatory cells, osteoblasts,
and osteoclasts in the bone healing microenvironment?
METHODS: Cortical defects were drilled in the femoral diaphysis of female and
male C57BL/6 mice aged 5 to 9 months that were treated with daily systemic
injections of LPS or physiologic saline as control for 7 days. Mice were
euthanized at 1 week (Control, n = 7; LPS, n = 8), 2 weeks (Control, n = 7; LPS, 
n = 8), and 6 weeks (Control, n = 9; LPS, n = 8) after surgery. The quantity
(bone volume per tissue volume [BV/TV]) and microarchitecture (trabecular
separation and thickness, porosity) of bone in the defect were quantified with
time using microCT. The presence or activity of vascular endothelial cells
(CD34), macrophages (F4/80), osteoblasts (alkaline phosphatase [ALP]), and
osteoclasts (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase [TRAP]) were evaluated using
histochemical analyses.
RESULTS: Only one of eight defects was bridged completely 6 weeks after surgery
in LPS-injected mouse bones compared with seven of nine defects in the control
mouse bones (odds ratio [OR], 0.04; 95% CI, 0.003-0.560; p = 0.007). The decrease
in cortical bone in LPS-treated mice was reflected in reduced BV/TV (21% ± 4% vs 
39% ± 10%; p < 0.01), increased trabecular separation (240 ± 36 μm vs 171 ± 29
μm; p < 0.01), decreased trabecular thickness (81 ± 18 μm vs 110 ± 22 μm; p =
0.02), and porosity (79% ± 4% vs 60% ± 10%; p < 0.01) at 6 weeks postoperative.
Defective healing was accompanied by decreased CD34 (1.1 ± 0.6 vs 3.4 ± 0.9; p < 
0.01), ALP (1.9 ± 0.9 vs 6.1 ± 3.2; p = 0.03), and TRAP (3.3 ± 4.7 vs 7.2 ± 4.0; 
p = 0.01) activity, and increased F4/80 (13 ± 2.6 vs 6.8 ± 1.7; p < 0.01)
activity at 2 weeks postoperative.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that LPS-induced systemic inflammation reduced
the amount and impaired the quality of bone regenerated in mouse femurs. The
effects were associated with impaired revascularization, decreased bone turnover 
by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and by increased catabolic activity by
macrophages.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results from this preclinical study support clinical
observations of impaired primary bone healing in patients with systemic
inflammation. Based on our data, local administration of VEGF in the callus to
stimulate revascularization, or transplantation of stem cells to enhance bone
turnover represent potentially feasible approaches to improve outcomes in
clinical practice.
