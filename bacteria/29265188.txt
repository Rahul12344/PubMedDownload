INTRODUCTION: Anti-secretory factor is a protein that regulates secretory and
inflammatory processes and preterm birth is associated with inflammation.
Therefore, our hypothesis was that anti-secretory factor might play a role in
immune reactivity and homeostasis during pregnancy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following spontaneous onset of labor and preterm or term
delivery, placenta biopsies were collected. The levels of anti-secretory factor
and markers of inflammation (CD68, CD163) and vascularization (CD34, smooth
muscle actin) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The 61 placental biopsies included 31 preterm (<37 weeks of gestation)
and 30 term (37-41 weeks) samples. The preterm placentas exhibited lower levels
of anti-secretory factor (p = 0.008) and larger numbers of CD68-positive cells (p
< 0.001) compared to term. Preterm placentas had blood vessel of smaller diameter
(p = 0.036) indicative of immaturity. The level of interleukin-6 in cord blood
was higher after very preterm than term birth, suggesting a fetal inflammatory
response. The placenta level of anti-secretory factor was positively correlated
to the length of gestation (p = 0.025) and negatively correlated to the levels of
the inflammatory markers CD68 (p = 0.015) and CD163 (p = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Preterm delivery is associated with low levels of anti-secretory
factor in placenta. Inflammation, a potential trigger of preterm birth, is more
pronounced in the preterm placenta and inversely related to the placental level
of anti-secretory factor, suggesting both a link and a potential target for
intervention.
