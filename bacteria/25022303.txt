INTRODUCTION: Camels migrate between the open boundaries of Sudan and Egypt
either for grazing or for slaughtering. Bad hygiene and stress is often related
to pulmonary diseases in camels. This study investigated whether camels
slaughtered in Cairo carried pulmonary infections.
METHODOLOGY: Five hundred lung tissues of slaughtered camels were examined and
100 samples suspected for pulmonary infection were subjected to microbial
identification and histopathology.
RESULTS: A total of 70 lung tissues revealed 97 bacterial isolates of 8 species, 
including Staphylococcus aureus (37.14%), Escherichia coli (27.14%), Klebsiella
pneumoniae (26.71%), Bacillus spp. (25.72%), Streptococcus pyogenes (10%),
Corynebacterium spp. (8.85 %), Pasteurella spp. (2.85%), and Arcanobacterium
pyogenes (1.4%). Some of these species were earlier reported to be associated
with pulmonary infection. Histopathology revealed different types of pneumonia in
50% of the investigated lungs.
CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of apparently healthy camels carry pathogenic 
agents in their lower respiratory tracts. Immunosuppression and stressful
conditions might influence these pathogens to induce respiratory diseases in
camels. Thus, the infected camels might act as reservoir of these infections
agents. If adequate care is not taken, this might be a threat to abattoir workers
and may spread infections to humans.
