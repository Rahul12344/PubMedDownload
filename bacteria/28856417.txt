The ineffectiveness of anti-tuberculous therapy against dormant and
drug-resistant mycobacteria demands scrutiny of alternative candidates like
antimicrobial peptides having different mechanisms of action. The present study
was designed to explore the activity of human beta defensin-1 (HBD-1) and its in 
silico identified short motif Pep-B against active and dormant Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tb) H37Rv. Activity of HBD-1 and Pep-B was determined against
actively growing M. tb in vitro, inside monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and
dormant bacilli in in vitro potassium deficiency and human peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) granuloma models using colony-forming unit enumeration.
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of HBD-1 and Pep-B were found to be 2
and 20 μg/ml, respectively. These peptides also inhibited intracellular
mycobacterial growth at concentrations lower than in vitro MICs along with
increased IFN-γ levels. Although at higher concentration, HBD-1 (× 2 MIC) and
Pep-B (× 2 MIC) led to decrease in in vitro dormant mycobacterial load as
compared to rifampicin (× 25 MIC) and isoniazid (× 16 MIC). Similarly, both
peptides showed higher killing efficacy against dormant mycobacteria inside
granuloma as compared to rifampicin. Thus, the present study indicates that HBD-1
and its motif are effective antimicrobial players against both actively growing
and dormant mycobacteria.
