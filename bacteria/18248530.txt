CD8+ T cells are thought to play an important role in protective immunity against
tuberculosis. We report the identification of three peptides derived from
Rv1818c, Rv3812 and Rv3018c proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that bound to 
HLA-A*0201 molecules and their ability to induce in vitro T-cell response in
peripheral blood lymphocytes from HLA-A*0201-positive healthy individuals (PPD+) 
and patients with TB. The peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL)
generated were capable of recognizing peptide pulsed targets. Three 9-mer
peptides bound with high affinity to HLA-A*0201 and displayed low dissociation
rates of the bound peptide from HLA. Epitope-specific recognition was
demonstrated by the release of perforin and gamma-interferon. Overall, our
results demonstrate the presence of HLA class I-restricted CD8+ CTL against
proteins from PE and PPE proteins of M. tuberculosis and identify epitopes that
are strongly recognized by HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8+ T cells in humans. These
epitopes thus represent potential subunit components for the design of vaccines
against tuberculosis.
