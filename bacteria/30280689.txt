In early 2017, a United Kingdom (UK)-born person in their 20s presented with a
skin ulcer on the foot 3 weeks after returning from Ghana. The patient had last
received a diphtheria-containing vaccine in 2013, completing the recommended
course. MALDI-TOF of a cutaneous swab identified Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
Real-time PCR ascertained the species and presence of the diphtheria toxin gene. 
An Elek test confirmed toxigenicity. The isolate was macrolide sensitive and
penicillin resistant. The local Public Health England (PHE) Health Protection
Team obtained the patient's clinical history and traced contacts to inform
appropriate public health action. One close contact (in their early 80s with
uncertain immunisation status who had not recently travelled) had a positive
throat swab for toxigenic C. diphtheriae and reported a history of mild coryzal
symptoms. Multilocus sequence typing revealed that strains from the index case
and contact had Sequence Type 463. Diphtheria is extremely rare in the UK due to 
high vaccine coverage and this is the first documented transmission in 30 years. 
Clinicians and laboratory staff should remain highly suspicious of lesions in
overseas travellers, even when patients are fully vaccinated. Older individuals
who might not have completed a full immunisation course may have higher
diphtheria susceptibility.
