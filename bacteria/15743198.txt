Elevated aldosterone levels are key effectors for the development and progression
of congestive heart failure and myocardial fibrosis. Recently, we proposed
inhibition of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) as an innovative strategy for the
treatment of these diseases. In this study, the synthesis and biological
evaluation of E- and Z-(pyridylmethylene)tetrahydronaphthalenes and -indanes
(1a,b-38a) is described. The activity of the compounds was determined using human
CYP11B2, and the selectivity was evaluated toward the human steroidogenic enzymes
CYP11B1, CYP19, and CYP17. The biological results revealed a few rather selective
inhibitors of CYP11B1, some compounds inhibiting both CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, and a 
large number of highly selective inhibitors of CYP11B2. The most active inhibitor
was the 3-pyridyl compound 5a (IC(50) = 7 nM). The pyrimidyl-substituted
derivative 28a was found to be the most selective CYP11B2 inhibitor (IC(50) = 27 
nM) in this series, showing a 120-fold selectivity for CYP11B1 (IC(50) = 3179
nM). Molecular modeling, i.e., examination of the electronic and steric features 
of selected compounds and homology modeling and docking, was used to understand
the structure-activity/-selectivity relationships.
