BACKGROUND: In the present study, the expression and localization of three
epithelial peptides (human β-defensin [hBD]-2 and -3, and cathelicidin [LL-37])
are studied in an organotypic dento-epithelial (OD-E) model exposed to
Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) biofilm.
METHODS: Biofilm of Fn ATCC 25586 or AHN 9508 were produced by culturing each
strain on semipermeable membranes. The OD-E model was constructed by seeding
keratinocytes on fibroblast-containing collagen gels and by placing dentin pieces
on the top. A 3-day-old biofilm was placed on the top of the OD-E and the
coculture was incubated for 5 hours or 24 hours. Production of epithelial
antimicrobial peptides was determined immunohistochemically.
RESULTS: After 5 hours of incubation, the biofilm of each Fn strain stimulated
expression of hBD-2 and -3. hBD-2 was localized on superficial layers and hBD-3
on basal cell layers of the epithelium and dento-epithelial junctions, whereas
LL-37 was only weakly expressed. After 24 hours, hBD-2 expression was extended
toward basal cell layers of the epithelium. In contrast, hBD-3 expression
extended toward superficial layers of the epithelium. In the case of Fn AHN 9508 
biofilm, LL-37 was localized in the cell layers of the dento-epithelial junction.
CONCLUSION: In our OD-E model, epithelial antimicrobial peptide responses to Fn
biofilms have distinct regulation and localization characteristics, resembling
those known to occur in the gingival epithelium in vivo.
