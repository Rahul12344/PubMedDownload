Various sodium bacterial cellulose sulfates (SBCS) were prepared via the
homogeneous sulfation of bacterial cellulose (BC) with a SO3/pyridine (Py)
complex in a dimethyl acetamide/lithium chloride solution. The SBCSs were
characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, gel permeation
chromatography, elemental analyses, and thermal gravimetric analyses. A variety
of conditions (including various amounts of SO3/Py, temperatures, and reaction
times) were utilized to obtain SBCSs with DS values that ranged from 0.10 to
1.50. The XRD profiles indicated that the SBCSs had a cellulose II analog
polymorphous structure. The differences between BC and microcrystalline cellulose
(MC) were studied in their respective reactions. BC is more reactive than MC in
both the sulfation and depolymerization processes. The order of reactivity for
COH is C6>C2>C3 for both BC and MC. Cellulose sulfates with DS values >0.31 were 
soluble in deionized water.
