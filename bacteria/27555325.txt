The protective antigen (PA) moiety of anthrax toxin binds to cellular receptors
and mediates the translocation of the two enzymatic moieties of the toxin to the 
cytosol. Two PA receptors are known, with capillary morphogenesis protein 2
(CMG2) being the more important for pathogenesis and tumor endothelial marker 8
(TEM8) playing a minor role. The C-terminal PA domain 4 (PAD4) has extensive
interactions with the receptors and is required for binding. Our previous study
identified PAD4 variants having enhanced TEM8 binding specificity. To obtain PA
variants that selectively bind to CMG2, here we performed phage display
selections using magnetic beads having bound CMG2. We found that PA residue
isoleucine 656 plays a critical role in PA binding to TEM8 but has a much lesser 
effect on PA binding to CMG2. We further characterized the role of residue 656 in
distinguishing PA binding to CMG2 versus TEM8 by substituting it with the other
19 amino acids. Of the resulting variants, PA I656Q and PA I656V had
significantly reduced activity on TEM8-expressing CHO cells but maintained their 
activity on CMG2-expressing CHO cells. The preference of these PA mutants for
CMG2 over TEM8 was further demonstrated using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells
and mice deficient in the CMG2 and/or the TEM8 receptors. The structural basis of
the alterations in the receptor binding activities of these mutants is also
discussed.
