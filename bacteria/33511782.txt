Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a DNA repair mechanism that religates
double-strand DNA breaks to maintain genomic integrity during the entire cell
cycle. The Ku70/80 complex recognizes DNA breaks and serves as an essential hub
for recruitment of NHEJ components. Here, we describe intramolecular interactions
of the Ku70 C-terminal domain, known as the SAP domain. Using single-particle
cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometric analysis of intermolecular
cross-linking and molecular modelling simulations, we captured variable positions
of the SAP domain depending on DNA binding. The first position was localized at
the DNA aperture in the Ku70/80 apo form but was not observed in the DNA-bound
state. The second position, which was observed in both apo and DNA-bound states, 
was found below the DNA aperture, close to the helical arm of Ku70. The
localization of the SAP domain in the DNA aperture suggests a function as a
flexible entry gate for broken DNA. DATABASES: EM maps have been deposited in
