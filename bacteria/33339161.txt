Helicobacter pylori infection induces a plethora of DNA damages. Gastric
epithelial cells, in order to maintain genomic integrity, require an integrous
DNA damage repair (DDR) machinery, which, however, is reported to be modulated by
the infection. CagA is a major H. pylori virulence factor, associated with
increased risk for gastric carcinogenesis. Its pathogenic activity is partly
regulated by phosphorylation on EPIYA motifs. Our aim was to identify effects of 
H. pylori infection and CagA on DDR, investigating the transcriptome of AGS
cells, infected with wild-type, Î”CagA and EPIYA-phosphorylation-defective
strains. Upon RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analysis, we observed that a notable
number of DDR genes were found deregulated during the infection, potentially
resulting to base excision repair and mismatch repair compromise and an intricate
deregulation of nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination and
non-homologous end-joining. Transcriptome observations were further investigated 
on the protein expression level, utilizing infections of AGS and GES-1 cells. We 
observed that CagA contributed to the downregulation of Nth Like DNA Glycosylase 
1 (NTHL1), MutY DNA Glycosylase (MUTYH), Flap Structure-Specific Endonuclease 1
(FEN1), RAD51 Recombinase, DNA Polymerase Delta Catalytic Subunit (POLD1), and
DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1) and, contrary to transcriptome results, Apurinic/Apyrimidinic
Endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APE1) upregulation. Our study accentuates the role of
CagA as a significant contributor of H. pylori infection-mediated DDR modulation,
potentially disrupting the balance between DNA damage and repair, thus favoring
genomic instability and carcinogenesis.
