The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a conserved signalling pathway activated
on the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
termed ER stress. Upon ER stress, HAC1/XBP1 undergoes exon/intron-specific
excision by inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) to remove an intron and liberate
the 5' and 3' exons. In yeast, the 5' and 3' HAC1 exons are subsequently ligated 
by tRNA ligase (Rlg1p), whereas XBP1 ligation in mammalian cells is catalysed by 
a recently identified ligase, RtcB. In the present study, RNA ligase activity of 
the human RtcB (hRtcB) involved in the unconventional splicing of XBP1/HAC1 mRNA 
was explored in an rlg1-100 mutant yeast strain. Distinct from Escherichia coli
RtcB and Rlg1p, expression of hRtcB alone inefficiently complemented HAC1/XBP1
splicing and the hRtcB cofactor (archease) was required to promote enzymatic
activity of hRtcB to catalyse RNA ligation.
