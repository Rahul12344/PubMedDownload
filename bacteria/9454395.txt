Five hundred and ninety-nine patients with traumatic wounds of hands or feet with
underlying lesions of the bone, tendon or joint, were randomized to double blind 
treatment with either A) one injection of penicillin, B) penicillin tablets for
six days or C) no antibiotic treatment. In group A the infection rate was 4.9%,
in group B it was 6.6% and in group C 10.2%. The difference between the infection
rates in group A and C was 5.3% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) from 0.1 to
10.4%, (p = 0.046). Correction for an interim analysis and subgroup analysis
increases this p-value to 0.096. The difference between the infection rates in
group B and C was 3.6% (95%, CI from -1.9 to 8.9%, p = 0.20). Patients in group B
had gastrointestinal complaints five times as often as patients in group A and C.
Based on the results we advise that a single prophylactic injection of penicillin
is given to patients with these injuries.
