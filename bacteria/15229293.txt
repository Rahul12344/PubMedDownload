Methylating agents introduce cytotoxic 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and
3-methylcytosine (3-meC) residues into nucleic acids, and it was recently
demonstrated that the Escherichia coli AlkB protein and two human homologues,
hABH2 and hABH3, can remove these lesions from DNA by oxidative demethylation.
Moreover, AlkB and hABH3 were also found to remove 1-meA and 3-meC from RNA,
suggesting that cellular RNA repair can occur. We have here studied the
preference of AlkB, hABH2 and hABH3 for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and show that AlkB and hABH3 prefer ssDNA, while
hABH2 prefers dsDNA. This was consistently observed with three different
oligonucleotide substrates, implying that the specificity for single-stranded
versus double-stranded DNA is sequence independent. The dsDNA preference of hABH2
was observed only in the presence of magnesium. The activity of the enzymes on
single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and DNA/RNA hybrids was 
also investigated, and the results generally confirm the notion that while AlkB
and hABH3 tend to prefer single-stranded nucleic acids, hABH2 is more active on
double-stranded substrates. These results may contribute to identifying the main 
substrates of bacterial and human AlkB proteins in vivo.
