A double antibody ELISA technique is described to detect HLA antigens in extracts
of blood stains. The assay involves capture of free HLA determinants using an
immobilized monoclonal antibody directed against monomorphic regions of HLA class
I and HLA class II antigens. The captured antigens are then detected using
alloantisera directed against the polymorphic regions of the captured HLA
entities. The technique is able to detect specific HLA-A, B, and DR antigens in
extracts prepared from blood smears as well as from dried and freshly thawed
lymphocytes. The assay may be of potential use in forensic medicine, particularly
in instances where extraction of nucleic acids for fingerprinting is not
feasible.
