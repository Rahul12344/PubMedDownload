During T-cell regulation, T-cell receptors and CD28 lead to signaling activation,
while T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is known to lead to downregulation, similar
to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). In the cytoplasmic tails of CD28 and CTLA-4,
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) binds to the consensus sequence including
phosphotyrosine via SH2 domains, N- and C-terminal SH2 domains (nSH2 and cSH2),
of its regulatory subunit, p85. In this study, we determined the crystal
structure of a CTLA-4-derived phosphopeptide in complex with a Cys-substituted
mutant of cSH2, C656S/C659V/C670L, at a 1.1 Å resolution. Phosphotyrosine of the 
bound peptide is tightly accommodated by the residues Arg631, Arg649, Ser651, and
Ser652, similar to the cSH2 wild-type recognition mode of CD28, as reported
previously. Upon the Cys mutation, the cSH2 thermal stability increased while the
CTLA-4 binding affinity slightly changed. The binding experiments also showed
that the binding affinity of CTLA-4 by cSH2 was approximately two orders of
magnitude lower than that of CD28. Similar to CD28 binding, the CTLA-4 binding
affinity of nSH2 was lower than that of cSH2. The complex structure of nSH2 and
CTLA-4 was modeled, and compared with the crystal structure of cSH2 mutant and
CTLA-4. The difference in the binding affinity between CD28 and CTLA-4, along
with the difference between nSH2 and cSH2, could be explained by the 3D
structures, which would be closely correlated with the respective T-cell
signaling.
