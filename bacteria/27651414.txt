BACKGROUND:  Nasal colonization has gained attention as an effect modifier in
Staphylococcus aureus vaccine trials, suggesting interference of carriage with
T-cell immunity. Likewise, T-cell signals may be involved in regulating effectors
of epithelial innate defense.
METHODS:  Whole blood from 43 persistent carriers and 49 noncarriers was
stimulated with viable S. aureus T-helper type 1 (Th1), Th2, and Th17 cytokine
expression was measured, compared between carrier groups, and linked with data on
human β-defensin 3 (hBD-3) messenger RNA (mRNA) in skin while adjusting for
transcriptionally relevant promoter haplotypes.
RESULTS:  Compared with carriers, stimulated whole blood from noncarriers
contained on average 60% more interferon γ mRNA (P = .031) and 19% less
interleukin 17A (IL-17A) mRNA (P = .11), resulting in, on average, a 90% higher
IFN-γ to IL-17A mRNA ratio (P = .003). In a multivariable model, per duplication 
of the mRNA template, the risk of being a carrier increased by 93% for IL-17A
(odds ratio [OR], 1.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-3.41; P = .023) and
decreased by 35% for IFN-γ (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.91; P = .01). Independent of
carriage and DEFB promotor haplotype, a 1-unit increase in the IFN-γ to IL-17A
mRNA ratio (mean ± SD, 5.93 ± 1.60) led to a 24% increase in hBD-3 transcription 
in experimentally wounded human skin (P = .003).
CONCLUSIONS:  A low Th1 to Th17 mRNA ratio increases the propensity for
persistent S. aureus nasal colonization, with downregulated hBD-3 transcription
providing a potential link.
