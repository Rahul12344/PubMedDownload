Although hematopoietic precursor activity can be generated in vitro from human
embryonic stem cells, there is no solid evidence for the appearance of
multipotent, self-renewing and transplantable hematopoietic stem cells. This
could be due to short half-life of hematopoietic stem cells in culture or,
alternatively, human embryonic stem cell-initiated hematopoiesis may be
hematopoietic stem cell-independent, similar to yolk sac hematopoiesis,
generating multipotent progenitors with limited expansion capacity. Since a MYB
was reported to be an excellent marker for hematopoietic stem cell-dependent
hematopoiesis, we generated a MYB-eGFP reporter human embryonic stem cell line to
study formation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. We found CD34(+)
hemogenic endothelial cells rounding up and developing into CD43(+) hematopoietic
cells without expression of MYB-eGFP. MYB-eGFP(+) cells appeared relatively late 
in embryoid body cultures as CD34(+)CD43(+)CD45(-/lo) cells. These MYB-eGFP(+)
cells were CD33 positive, proliferated in IL-3 containing media and hematopoietic
differentiation was restricted to the granulocytic lineage. In agreement with
data obtained on murine Myb(-/-) embryonic stem cells, bright eGFP expression was
observed in a subpopulation of cells, during directed myeloid differentiation,
which again belonged to the granulocytic lineage. In contrast, CD14(+) macrophage
cells were consistently eGFP(-) and were derived from eGFP-precursors only. In
summary, no evidence was obtained for in vitro generation of MYB(+) hematopoietic
stem cells during embryoid body cultures. The observed MYB expression appeared
late in culture and was confined to the granulocytic lineage.
