Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer, promoting growth and metastasis.
Anti-angiogenic treatment has limited efficacy due to therapy-induced blood
vessel alterations, often followed by local hypoxia, tumor adaptation,
progression, and metastasis. It is therefore paramount to overcome
therapy-induced resistance. We show that Apelin inhibition potently remodels the 
tumor microenvironment, reducing angiogenesis, and effectively blunting tumor
growth. Functionally, targeting Apelin improves vessel function and reduces
polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration. Importantly, in
mammary and lung cancer, Apelin prevents resistance to anti-angiogenic receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor therapy, reducing growth and angiogenesis in lung
and breast cancer models without increased hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment.
Apelin blockage also prevents RTK inhibitor-induced metastases, and high Apelin
levels correlate with poor prognosis of anti-angiogenic therapy patients. These
data identify a druggable anti-angiogenic drug target that reduces tumor blood
vessel densities and normalizes the tumor vasculature to decrease metastases.
