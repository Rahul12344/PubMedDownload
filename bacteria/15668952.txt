BACKGROUND: The stem cell marker CD34 is expressed by leukemia blasts only for a 
subset of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is still
controversial as to whether CD34 expression (defined as at least 10-20% positive 
cells) has any prognostic effect in patients with AML who receive intensive
chemotherapy. The present study investigated whether gene expression profiling
could be used to further subclassify CD34(+) AML cell populations.
METHODS: AML blasts derived from 25 patients were examined; these patients were
randomly selected from a larger consecutive group of patients. CD34 protein
expression was determined by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of
positive cells. Gene expression profiles were determined by complementary DNA
microarrays.
RESULTS: By unsupervised hierarchical clustering our patients could be grouped
into two or three major subsets depending on the methodologic approach before
clustering analysis (filtering or flooring of data, respectively). However, both 
approaches identified a cluster characterized by high gene expression and
membrane molecule level of CD34. When using the floored expression profiles, the 
patient cluster characterized by increased CD34 gene expression was also
characterized by a high percentage of CD34(+) cells (median 82%, range 56-100%)
compared with the two other major clusters (median 19%, range <1-55%), but three 
of four outpatients also showed a high percentage of CD34(+) cells.
CONCLUSION: A major proportion of patients with AML and high CD34 expression
(usually >80% CD34(+) cells; nearly all patients had >50% positive cells) showed 
similarities in gene expression profile. In contrast, patients with lower CD34
expression often had a profile similar to those of patients regarded as CD34(-)
according to conventional criteria. Our results suggest that the possible
prognostic effect of CD34 expression should be reevaluated in clinical studies
using additional or alternative cutoff values to describe CD34 expression.
