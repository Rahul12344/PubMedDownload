OBJECTIVE: This multicentre study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic
accuracy of a wide spectrum of novel technologies nowadays available for
detection of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3)-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).
METHODS: Sera (obtained at the time of diagnosis) from 251 patients with
ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), including granulomatosis with polyangiitis and 
microscopic polyangiitis, and from 924 disease controls were tested for the
presence of cytoplasmic pattern/perinuclear pattern and atypical ANCA (A-ANCA) by
indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) (at two sites) and for the presence of PR3-ANCA
and MPO-ANCA by eight different immunoassays.
RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic 
curve to discriminate AAV from controls was 0.923 (95% CI 0.902 to 0.944) and
0.843 (95% CI 0.814 to 0.871) for the two IIF methods. For the antigen-specific
immunoassays, the AUC varied between 0.936 (95% CI 0.912 to 0.960) and 0.959 (95%
CI 0.941 to 0.976), except for one immunoassay for which the AUC was 0.919 (95%
CI 0.892 to 0.945).
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparison of various ANCA detection methods showed (i) large
variability between the two IIF methods tested and (ii) a high diagnostic
performance of PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA by immunoassay to discriminate AAV from
disease controls. Consequently, dual IIF/antigen-specific immunoassay testing of 
each sample is not necessary for maximal diagnostic accuracy. These results
indicate that the current international consensus on ANCA testing for AAV needs
revision.
