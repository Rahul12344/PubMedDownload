HA-1A has been shown clinically to decrease mortality in septic patients with
gram-negative bacteremia. In this study, the ability of HA-1A to augment the
serum complement-dependent immune adherence of 125I-labeled Escherichia coli J5
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to human erythrocytes (RBC) and polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMNL) was evaluated. In vitro studies indicated three things: HA-1A
mediates immune adherence of 125I-J5 LPS to human RBC and PMNL in a
dose-dependent manner; under these conditions, high concentrations of LPS (400
ng/mL) could be specifically bound. Immune adherence occurs via the classical
complement pathway as demonstrated by its calcium dependence; HA-1A-J5 LPS-C'
immune complexes bound to CR1 on human RBC and PMNL. PMNL binding and
internalization of immune complexes was demonstrated by trypsin stripping of
externally bound immune complexes. These studies support the proposal that HA-1A 
can lower the bioavailability of endotoxin by mediating binding and potential
clearance of LPS via human RBC through the reticuloendothelial system or via
direct internalization by peripheral blood PMNL.
