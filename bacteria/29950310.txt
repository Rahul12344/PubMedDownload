Cells sense myriad signals during G1, and a rapid response to prevent cell cycle 
entry is of crucial importance for proper development and adaptation. Cln3, the
most upstream G1 cyclin in budding yeast, is an extremely short-lived protein
subject to ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, nuclear
accumulation of Cln3 depends on chaperones that are also important for its
degradation. However, how these processes are intertwined to control G1-cyclin
fate is not well understood. Here, we show that Cln3 undergoes a challenging
ubiquitination step required for both degradation and full activation. Segregase 
Cdc48/p97 prevents degradation of ubiquitinated Cln3, and concurrently stimulates
its ER release and nuclear accumulation to trigger Start. Cdc48/p97
phosphorylation at conserved Cdk-target sites is important for recruitment of
specific cofactors and, in both yeast and mammalian cells, to attain proper
G1-cyclin levels and activity. Cdk-dependent modulation of Cdc48 would subjugate 
G1 cyclins to fast and reversible state switching, thus arresting cells promptly 
in G1 at developmental or environmental checkpoints, but also resuming G1
progression immediately after proliferative signals reappear.
