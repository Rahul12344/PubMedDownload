Type I natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like T lymphocytes that recognize 
glycolipid antigens presented by the MHC class I-like protein CD1d. Agonistic
activation of NKT cells leads to rapid pro-inflammatory and immune modulatory
cytokine and chemokine responses. This property of NKT cells, in conjunction with
their interactions with antigen-presenting cells, controls downstream innate and 
adaptive immune responses against cancers and infectious diseases, as well as in 
several inflammatory disorders. NKT cell properties are acquired during
development in the thymus and by interactions with the host microbial consortium 
in the gut, the nature of which can be influenced by NKT cells. This latter
property, together with the role of the host microbiota in cancer therapy,
necessitates a new perspective. Hence, this review provides an initial approach
to understanding NKT cells from an ecological evolutionary developmental biology 
(eco-evo-devo) perspective.
