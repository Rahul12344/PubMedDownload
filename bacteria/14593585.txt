Staphylococcal peptidoglycan suppresses production of interleukin-2 by T cells
through a T cell-derived factor induced by direct contact between T cells and
monocytes.

During the last 2 decades, the incidence of sepsis due to gram-positive bacteria 
has increased dramatically. Nevertheless, effects of the cell-wall components
that do not contain endotoxin, on immunity, are still largely unknown. Here, we
demonstrate, for the first time, that the gram-positive bacterial cell-wall
component peptidoglycan (PGN) severely inhibits the production of interleukin
(IL)-2 by cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with
anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the
inhibitory effect is mediated predominantly by a soluble mediator produced by T
cells and that the production of the inhibitory mediator is induced by direct
cell-to-cell contact of T cells with PGN-stimulated monocytes. The T cell-derived
inhibitory mediator is distinct from known immunosuppressive lymphokines, such as
IL-10 and IL-4. In light of the key role of IL-2 in cell-mediated immunity, it
can be suggested that PGN induces the dysfunction of cell-mediated immunity.
