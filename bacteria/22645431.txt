BACKGROUND: Two major causes of gastric ulcers are Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori) infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.
AIMS: This study aimed to determine if there were different expressions of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1
(TIMP-1) between H. pylori-infected and NSAID-related ulcers.
METHODS: The 126 gastric ulcer patients (H. pylori infected n = 46; NSAID related
n = 30; combined with two factors n = 50) provided ulcer and nonulcer tissues for
assessment of MMP-3, -7, and -9 and TIMP-1 expression by immunohistochemical
staining.
RESULTS: Gastric ulcer tissues had significantly higher MMP-3, -7, and -9 and
TIMP-1 expressions than nonulcer tissues (P < 0.05). H. pylori-infected gastric
ulcers had even higher MMP-7, MMP-9, and TIMP-1 expressions in epithelial cells
than NSAID-related gastric ulcers (P < 0.05). In patients with the two combined
factors, gastric ulcers expressed similar proportions of antral ulcers and MMP-7 
and MMP-9 intensities to NSAID-related gastric ulcers, but lower MMP-9 and TIMP-1
than H. pylori-infected gastric ulcers (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori-infected gastric ulcers express higher MMP-7, MMP-9, and
TIMP-1 than NSAID-related ulcers. In patients with the two combined factors,
ulcer location and MMP-7 and MMP-9 intensities are similar to NSAID use.
