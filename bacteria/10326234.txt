In dairy goats there is less evidence for relationships between udder form
traits, results of physical udder examinations and mastitis indicators in the
milk than in dairy cows. In 413 goats (predominantly Weisse Deutsche Edelziege
and Bunte Deutsche Edelziege) from five herds (free from C.A.E.) repeated
investigations of 2537 udder halves and fore milk samples were carried out in
order to compare udder traits with findings in the milk. Less than 20% positive
bacteriological findings and a low incidence of clinical mastitis testified a
good clinical udder health status of the herds. Small teat-floor distances, loose
hanging of the udders and bottle-shaped teats, findings which tended to become
more frequent as lactation and lactation numbers progressed, indurative
alterations of the mammary tissues and the teats tended to be connected with
higher milk cell counts (> 1 million/microliter), more polymorphonuclear milk
cells (> 40%), higher electrical milk conductivity (> 6.8 mS/cm) and lower milk
lactose content (< 4.6%). A similar effect had a bad state of foot trimming. It
is proposed to include the studied udder traits into herd health programs and
breeding schemes for goats.
