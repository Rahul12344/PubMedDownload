In archival samples of European-ancestry subjects, light-eyed individuals have
been found to consume more alcohol than dark-eyed individuals. No published
population-based studies have directly tested the association between alcohol
dependence (AD) and eye color. We hypothesized that light-eyed individuals have a
higher prevalence of AD than dark-eyed individuals. A mixture model was used to
select a homogeneous sample of 1,263 European-Americans and control for
population stratification. After quality control, we conducted an association
study using logistic regression, adjusting for confounders (age, sex, and genetic
ancestry). We found evidence of association between AD and blue eye color
(P = 0.0005 and odds ratio = 1.83 (1.31-2.57)), supporting light eye color as a
risk factor relative to brown eye color. Network-based analyses revealed a
statistically significant (P = 0.02) number of genetic interactions between eye
color genes and AD-associated genes. We found evidence of linkage disequilibrium 
between an AD-associated GABA receptor gene cluster, GABRB3/GABRG3, and eye color
genes, OCA2/HERC2, as well as between AD-associated GRM5 and
pigmentation-associated TYR. Our population-phenotype, network, and linkage
disequilibrium analyses support association between blue eye color and AD.
Although we controlled for stratification we cannot exclude underlying occult
stratification as a contributor to this observation. Although replication is
needed, our findings suggest that eye pigmentation information may be useful in
research on AD. Further characterization of this association may unravel new AD
etiological factors. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
