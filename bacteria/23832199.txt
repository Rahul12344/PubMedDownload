MauG has been cocrystallized with methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) with its TTQ
cofactor in the o-quinol (TTQOQ) and quinone (TTQOX) forms and the structures of 
the resulting complexes have been solved. The TTQOQ structure crystallized in
either space group P21 or C2, while the TTQOX structure crystallized in space
group P1. The previously solved structure of MauG in complex with MADH bearing an
incompletely formed TTQ cofactor (preMADH) also crystallized in space group P1,
although with different unit-cell parameters. Despite the changes in crystal
form, the structures are virtually identical, with only very minor changes at the
protein-protein interface. The relevance of these structures with respect to the 
measured changes in affinity between MauG and various forms of MADH is discussed.
