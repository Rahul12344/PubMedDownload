Chronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water causes cancer and non-cancer
diseases. However, mechanisms for chronic arsenic-induced pathogenesis,
especially in response to lower exposure levels, are unclear. In addition, the
importance of health impacts from xeniobiotic-promoted microbiome changes is just
being realized and effects of arsenic on the microbiome with relation to disease 
promotion are unknown. To investigate impact of arsenic exposure on both
microbiome and host metabolism, the stucture and composition of colonic
microbiota, their metabolic phenotype, and host tissue and plasma metabolite
levels were compared in mice exposed for 2, 5, or 10weeks to 0, 10 (low) or 250
(high) ppb arsenite (As(III)). Genotyping of colonic bacteria revealed time and
arsenic concentration dependent shifts in community composition, particularly the
Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, relative to those seen in the time-matched
controls. Arsenic-induced erosion of bacterial biofilms adjacent to the mucosal
lining and changes in the diversity and abundance of morphologically distinct
species indicated changes in microbial community structure. Bacterical spores
increased in abundance and intracellular inclusions decreased with high dose
arsenic. Interestingly, expression of arsenate reductase (arsA) and the As(III)
exporter arsB, remained unchanged, while the dissimilatory nitrite reductase
(nrfA) gene expression increased. In keeping with the change in nitrogen
metabolism, colonic and liver nitrite and nitrate levels and ratios changed with 
time. In addition, there was a concomitant increase in pathogenic arginine
metabolites in the mouse circulation. These data suggest that arsenic exposure
impacts the microbiome and microbiome/host nitrogen metabolism to support disease
enhancing pathogenic phenotypes.
