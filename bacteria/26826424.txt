The macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) family, consisting of MIF and
D-dopachrome tautomerase (DDT) in vertebrates, is evolutionarily ancient and has 
been found across Kingdoms including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and
bacteria. The mammalian MIF family are chemokines at the top of the inflammatory 
cascade in combating infections. They also possess enzymatic activities, e.g. DDT
catalysis results in the production of 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI), a precursor of 
eumelanin. MIF-like genes are widely distributed, but DDT-like genes have only
been described in vertebrates and a nematode. In this report, we cloned a
DDT-like gene, for the first time in arthropods, and a second MIF in mud crab.
The mud crab MIF family have a three exon/two intron structure as seen in
vertebrates. The identification of a DDT-like gene in mud crab and other
arthropods suggests that the separation of MIF and DDT preceded the divergence of
protostomes and deuterostomes. The MIF family is differentially expressed in
tissues of adults and during embryonic development and early life. The high level
expression of the MIF family in immune tissues, such as intestine and
hepatopancreas, suggests an important role in mud crab innate immunity. Mud crab 
DDT is highly expressed in early embryos, in megalops and crablets and this
coincides with the requirement for melanisation in egg chorion tanning and
cuticular hardening in arthropods, suggesting a potential novel role of DDT in
melanogenesis via its tautomerase activity to produce DHI in mud crab. The
clarification of the presence of both MIF and DDT in this report paves the way
for further investigation of their functional roles in immunity and in
melanogenesis in mud crab and other arthropods.
