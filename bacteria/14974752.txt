SETTING: The immunological mechanisms that lead to the control of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection are not well known.
OBJECTIVE: To study the role of lymphocyte subsets and co-stimulatory molecules
in M. tuberculosis infection.
DESIGN: In 35 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and their contacts, 29
persons with tuberculin skin test conversion (TSTC) and 20 healthy individuals
with negative tuberculin skin test (NTST), we studied T-lymphocyte subsets (CD3, 
CD4, CD8, alphabetaTCR and gammadeltaTCR), B-cells, monocytes and co-stimulatory 
molecules CD28 and CD86 in peripheral blood. The results were analysed at
univariate and multivariate level through discriminant analysis.
RESULTS: At univariate level, compared with TSTC and NTST, PTB patients presented
a decrease in CD4+ T-cells (P = 0.002), and B-cells (P = 0.02 and 0.001,
respectively). With regard to NTST subjects, PTB patients also showed a decrease 
in the percentage of CD86+ monocytes (P = 0.02) and an increase in the percentage
of CD86+ B-lymphocytes (P = 0.02). At multivariate level, CD4+ T-lymphocytes
showed statistical differences between PTB and TSTC subjects (P = 0.001).
B-lymphocytes were discriminant between PTB and NTST (P < 0.001) and between TSTC
and NTST individuals (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The number of total CD4+ T-cells is the best discriminant parameter
for distinguishing between disease and infection, whereas the B-cell count is the
best between healthy and infected individuals.
