BACKGROUND: Vancomycin is a prevalent cause of the severe hypersensitivity
syndrome drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which
leads to significant morbidity and mortality and commonly occurs in the setting
of combination antibiotic therapy, affecting future treatment choices. Variations
in HLA class I in particular have been associated with serious T cell-mediated
adverse drug reactions, which has led to preventive screening strategies for some
drugs.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether variation in the HLA region is
associated with vancomycin-induced DRESS.
METHODS: Probable vancomycin-induced DRESS cases were matched 1:2 with tolerant
control subjects based on sex, race, and age by using BioVU, Vanderbilt's
deidentified electronic health record database. Associations between DRESS and
carriage of HLA class I and II alleles were assessed by means of conditional
logistic regression. An extended sample set from BioVU was used to conduct a
time-to-event analysis of those exposed to vancomycin with and without the
identified HLA risk allele.
RESULTS: Twenty-three subjects met the inclusion criteria for
vancomycin-associated DRESS. Nineteen (82.6%) of 23 cases carried HLA-A*32:01
compared with 0 (0%) of 46 of the matched vancomycin-tolerant control subjects
(P = 1 × 10-8) and 6.3% of the BioVU population (n = 54,249, P = 2 × 10-16).
Time-to-event analysis of DRESS development during vancomycin treatment among the
HLA-A*32:01-positive group indicated that 19.2% had DRESS and did so within
4 weeks.
CONCLUSIONS: HLA-A*32:01 is strongly associated with vancomycin-induced DRESS in 
a population of predominantly European ancestry. HLA-A*32:01 testing could
improve antibiotic safety, help implicate vancomycin as the causal drug, and
preserve future treatment options with coadministered antibiotics.
