The activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in
skeletal muscle coordinates systemic metabolic responses to exercise1.
Autophagy-a lysosomal degradation pathway that maintains cellular homeostasis2-is
upregulated during exercise, and a core autophagy protein, beclin 1, is required 
for AMPK activation in skeletal muscle3. Here we describe a role for the innate
immune-sensing molecule Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)4, and its interaction with
beclin 1, in exercise-induced activation of AMPK in skeletal muscle. Mice that
lack TLR9 are deficient in both exercise-induced activation of AMPK and plasma
membrane localization of the GLUT4 glucose transporter in skeletal muscle, but
are not deficient in autophagy. TLR9 binds beclin 1, and this interaction is
increased by energy stress (glucose starvation and endurance exercise) and
decreased by a BCL2 mutation3,5 that blocks the disruption of BCL2-beclin 1
binding. TLR9 regulates the assembly of the endolysosomal phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase complex (PI3KC3-C2)-which contains beclin 1 and UVRAG-in skeletal muscle
during exercise, and knockout of beclin 1 or UVRAG inhibits the cellular AMPK
activation induced by glucose starvation. Moreover, TLR9 functions in a
muscle-autonomous fashion in ex vivo contraction-induced AMPK activation, glucose
uptake and beclin 1-UVRAG complex assembly. These findings reveal a heretofore
undescribed role for a Toll-like receptor in skeletal-muscle AMPK activation and 
glucose metabolism during exercise, as well as unexpected crosstalk between this 
innate immune sensor and autophagy proteins.
