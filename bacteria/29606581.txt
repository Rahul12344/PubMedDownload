Rapid and efficient synaptic vesicle fusion requires a pool of primed vesicles,
the nearby tethering of Ca2+ channels, and the presence of the phospholipid PIP2 
in the target membrane. Although the presynaptic active zone mediates the first
two requirements, it is unclear how fusion is targeted to membranes with high
PIP2 content. Here we find that the C2B domain of the active zone scaffold RIM is
critical for action potential-triggered fusion. Remarkably, the known RIM
functions in vesicle priming and Ca2+ influx do not require RIM C2B domains.
Instead, biophysical experiments reveal that RIM C2 domains, which lack Ca2+
binding, specifically bind to PIP2. Mutational analyses establish that PIP2
binding to RIM C2B and its tethering to the other RIM domains are crucial for
efficient exocytosis. We propose that RIM C2B domains are constitutive
PIP2-binding modules that couple mechanisms for vesicle priming and Ca2+ channel 
tethering to PIP2-containing target membranes.
