Several descriptive studies have reported that higher neutrophil count (NC) may
be correlated with poor prognosis in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. 
However, the findings from these studies are limited by methodology and data
analysis. This study is a cohort study. We nonselectively and consecutively
collected a total of 663 participants in a Chinese hospital from January 7 to
February 28. Standardized and two-piecewise Cox regression model were employed to
evaluate the association between baseline neutrophil count (bNC), neutrophil
count change rate (NCR), and death. bNC had a U-shaped association with death. In
the range of 0.1 to ≤1.49 × 109 /L (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.19, 95% confidence
interval [CI] = 0.05-0.66) and >3.55 × 109 /L of bNC (HR = 2.82, 95%
CI = 1.19-6.67), the trends on bNC with mortality were opposite. By recursive
algorithm, the bNC at which the risk of the death was lower in the range of >1.49
to ≤3.55 × 109 /L (HR = 13.64, 95% CI = 0.25-74.71). In addition, we find that
NCRs (NCR1 and NCR2) are not associated with COVID-19-related deaths. Compared
with NCR, bNC has the potential to be used for early risk stratification in
patients with COVID-19 infection. The relationship between bNC and mortality was 
U-shaped. The safe range of bNC was 1.64-4.0 × 109 /L. Identifying the
correlation may be helpful for early risk stratification and medical
decision-making.
