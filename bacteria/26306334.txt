The Impact of Egg Ozonation on Hatching Success, Larval Growth, and Survival of
Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Salmon, and Rainbow Trout.

The direct exposure of fish eggs to ozonated water has generated interest as a
means of ensuring pathogen-free eggs without the use of harsh chemicals. However,
there are numerous knowledge gaps, including safe contact times, exposure levels,
and potential long-term effects on aquaculture species in both freshwater and
seawater. The effect of different ozone (O3) doses (0.5-1.0, 1.5-2.0, and 2.5-3.0
mg of O3/L for 90 s) on recently fertilized eggs of Atlantic Cod Gadus morhua and
eyed eggs of Atlantic Salmon Salmo salar and Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss
was evaluated in comparison with the effects of two commercial disinfectants:
Perosan (0.004 mg/L) and Ovadine (100 mg/L). The impact of ozone application was 
evaluated based on hatching success, larval nucleic acid concentration, larval
growth, and survival. Overall, results indicated that ozonation of Atlantic Cod
eggs at a dose less than 3.0 mg/L for 90 s produced no negative effect on the
larvae up to 30 d posthatch. Furthermore, ozonation of Atlantic Salmon and
Rainbow Trout eggs generated no negative effect on the larvae, based on
monitoring until 85% yolk sac re-absorption (16 d posthatch).
