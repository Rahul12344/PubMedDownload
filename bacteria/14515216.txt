The phycobilisomes were isolated from blue-green alga Spirulina platensis, and
could form monolayer film at air/water interface. The monolayer film of
phycobilisomes was transferred to newly cleaved mica, and coated with gold.
Scanning tunneling microscope was used to investigate the structure of the
Langmuir-Blodgett film of phycobilisomes. It was shown that phycobilisomes in the
monolayer arrayed in rows with core attaching on the substrate surface and rods
radiating towards the air phase, this phenomenon was similar to the arrangement
of phycobilisomes on cytoplasmic surface of thylakoid membrane in vivo. The
possible applications of the Langmuir-Blodgett film of phycobilisomes were also
discussed.
