Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) is the fastest growing human tumor. Current treatment
consists of a multiagent regimen of cytotoxic drugs with serious side effjects
including tumor lysis, cardiotoxicity, hepatic impairment, neuropathy,
myelosuppression, increased susceptibility to malignancy, and death. Furthermore,
therapeutic interventions in areas of BL prevalence are not as feasible as in
high-income countries. Therefore, there exists an urgent need to identify new
therapies with a safer profile and improved accessibility. Triclosan (TCS), an
antimicrobial used in personal care products and surgical scrubs, has gained
considerable interest as an antitumor agent due to its interference with fatty
acid synthesis. Here, we investigate the antitumor properties and associated
molecular mechanisms of TCS in BL-derived BJAB cells. Dose-dependent cell death
was observed following treatment with 10-100 µM TCS for 24 h, which was
associated with membrane phospholipid scrambling, compromised permeability, and
cell shrinkage. TCS-induced cell death was accompanied by elevated intracellular 
calcium, perturbed redox balance, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation. 
TCS upregulated Bad expression and downregulated that of Bcl2. Moreover, caspase 
and JNK MAPK signaling were required for the full apoptotic activity of TCS. In
conclusion, this report identifies TCS as an antitumor agent and provides new
insights into the molecular mechanisms governing TCS-induced apoptosis in BL
cells.
