Two human CC chemokines, SLC/6Ckine/Exodus2/TCA4 and CKbeta-11/MIP-3beta/ELC, are
previously reported as efficacious chemoattractants for T- and B-cells and
dendritic cells. SLC and CKbeta-11 share only 32% amino acid identity, but are
ligands for the same chemokine receptor, CCR7. In this study, we examined
chemotactic activity of SLC and CKbeta-11 for NK cells and lymphoid progenitors
in bone marrow and thymus. It was found that these two CCR7 ligands are
chemoattractants for neonatal cord blood and adult peripheral blood NK cells and 
cell lines. SLC and CKbeta-11 preferentially attract the CD56(+)CD16(-) NK cell
subset over CD56(+)CD16(+) NK cells. SLC and CKbeta-11 also demonstrate selective
chemotactic activity on late stage CD34(-)CD19(+)IgM- B-cell progenitors and
CD4(+) and CD8(+) single-positive thymocytes, but not early stage progenitors. It
was noted that SLC is an efficient desensitizer of CKbeta-11-dependent NK cell
chemotaxis, while CKbeta-11 is a weak desensitizer of SLC-dependent chemotaxis.
Taken together, these results suggest that SLC and CKbeta-11 have the potential
to control trafficking of NK cell subsets and late stage lymphoid progenitors in 
bone marrow and thymus.
