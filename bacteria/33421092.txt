Behçet disease is a multi-system disease associated with human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) class I polymorphism. High-resolution next-generation sequencing (NGS) with
haplotype analysis has not been performed previously for this disease. Sixty
Egyptian patients diagnosed according to the International Study Group (ISG)
criteria for Behçet disease and 160 healthy geographic and ethnic-matched
controls were genotyped for HLA class I loci (HLA-A, B, C). For HLA class II loci
(DRB1, DRB3/4/5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, DPB1), 40 control samples were genotyped.
High-resolution HLA genotyping was performed using NGS and the results were
analyzed. Clinical manifestations were oral ulcers (100%), genital ulcers (100%),
eye (55%) and neurological (28%) and vascular involvement (35%). HLA-B*51:08
[odds ratio (OR) = 19·75, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 6·5-79; P < 0·0001],
HLA-B*15:03 (OR = 12·15, 95% CI = 3·7-50·7; P < 0·0001), HLA-C*16:02 (OR = 6·53, 
95% CI = 3-14; P < 0·0001), HLA-A*68:02 (OR = 3·14, 95% CI = 1·1-8·9; P < 0·01)
were found to be associated with Behçet disease, as were HLA-DRB1*13:01 and
HLA-DQB1*06:03 (OR = 3·39, 95% CI = 0·9-18·9; P = 0·04 for both). By contrast,
HLA-A*03:01 (OR = 0·13, 95% CI = 0-0·8; P = 0·01) and HLA-DPB1*17:01 were found
to be protective (OR = 0·27, 95% CI = 0·06-1·03; P = 0·02). We identified strong 
linkage disequilibrium between HLA-B*51:08 and C*16:02 and A*02:01 in a haplotype
associated with Behçet disease. HLA-B*51:08 was significantly associated with
legal blindness (OR = 2·98, 95% CI = 1·06-8·3; P = 0·01). In Egyptian Behçet
patients, HLA-B*51:08 is the most common susceptibility allele and holds poor
prognosis for eye involvement.
