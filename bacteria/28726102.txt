We studied the effect of a heterogeneous environment on the stereoselectivity of 
transformation of racemic phenylglycine nitrile. Immobilized biocatalysts were
prepared by adhesion of Pseudomonas fluorescens C2 cells on carbon-containing
supports and covalent crosslinking of nitrile hydratase and amidase of
Rhodococcus rhodochrous 4-1 to activated chitosan as well as by the method of
cross-linked aggregates. At a reaction duration of 20 h, the ratio of
phenylglycine stereoisomers changes depending on the presence of support in
medium. The highest optical purity of the product (enantiomeric excess of
L-phenylglycine solution, 98%) is achieved when enzyme aggregates of nitrile
hydratase and amidase cross-linked with 0.1% glutaraldehyde are used as a
biocatalyst.
