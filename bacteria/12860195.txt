Antimicrobial peptides and proteins are effector molecules in the protection of
epithelial surfaces. We have evaluated the presence of antimicrobial
peptides/proteins that can participate in human colonic defence against microbes.
A peptide/protein extract of normal human colon mucosa was found to be active
against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Four
polypeptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from this material and
they were identified by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis as ubiquicidin,
histone H2B, eosinophil cationic protein, and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)). Using 
immunodetection and mass spectrometry, LL-37, HNP1-3, and HBD-1 were also
identified. Combined, these results indicate that the colon mucosa is protected
by a complex mixture of polypeptides, able to kill invading microbes and working 
in synergy as a barrier against bacterial invasion.
