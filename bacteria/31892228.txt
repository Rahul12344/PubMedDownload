The ability of commercial monolayer graphene oxide (GO) and graphene oxide
nanocolloids (GOC) to interact with different unicellular systems and
biomolecules was studied by analyzing the response of human alveolar carcinoma
epithelial cells, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bacteria Vibrio
fischeri to the presence of different nanoparticle concentrations, and by
studying the binding affinity of different microbial enzymes, like the
α-l-rhamnosidase enzyme RhaB1 from the bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and the
AbG β-d-glucosidase from Agrobacterium sp. (strain ATCC 21400). An analysis of
cytotoxicity on human epithelial cell line A549, S. cerevisiae (colony forming
units, ROS induction, genotoxicity) and V. fischeri (luminescence inhibition)
cells determined the potential of both nanoparticle types to damage the selected 
unicellular systems. Also, the protein binding affinity of the graphene
derivatives at different oxidation levels was analyzed. The reported results
highlight the variability that can exist in terms of toxicological potential and 
binding affinity depending on the target organism or protein and the selected
nanomaterial.
