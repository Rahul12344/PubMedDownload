Concomitant tumor resistance refers to the ability of some large primary tumors
to hold smaller tumors in check, preventing their progressive growth. Here, we
demonstrate this phenomenon with a human tumor growing in a nude mouse and show
that it is caused by secretion by the tumor of the inhibitor of angiogenesis,
thrombospondin-1. When growing subcutaneously, the human fibrosarcoma line HT1080
induced concomitant tumor resistance, preventing the growth of experimental
B16/F10 melanoma metastases in the lung. Resistance was due to the production by 
the tumor cells themselves of high levels of thrombospondin-1, which was present 
at inhibitory levels in the plasma of tumor-bearing animals who become unable to 
mount an angiogenic response in their corneas. Animals carrying tumors formed by 
antisense-derived subclones of HT1080 that secreted low or no thrombospondin had 
weak or no ability to control the growth of lung metastases. Although purified
human platelet thrombospondin-1 had no effect on the growth of melanoma cells in 
vitro, when injected into mice it was able to halt the growth of their
experimental metastases, providing clear evidence of the efficacy of
thrombospondin-1 as an anti-tumor agent.
