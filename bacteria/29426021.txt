BACKGROUND: Variation in an individual's genetic status can impact the
development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; however, the majority of
familial pancreatic cancers (FPC) cannot yet be attributed to a specific
inherited mutation. We present data suggesting a correlation between
loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an immune regulator
gene, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO2), and an increased risk of FPC.
STUDY DESIGN: Germline DNA from patients who underwent resection for pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 79) was sequenced for the IDO2 SNPs R248W and
Y359Stop. Genotypes resulting in inactivation of IDO2 (Y325X homozygous, R248W
homozygous) were labeled as homozygous, and the other genotypes were grouped as
wild-type or heterozygous. Genotype distributions of each SNP were analyzed for
Hardy-Weinberg deviation. A genotype frequency set from the 1000 Genomes Project 
(n = 99) was used as a genetic control for genotype distribution comparisons.
RESULTS: A significant 2-fold increase in the overall prevalence of the Y359Stop 
homozygous genotype compared with the expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
noted (p < 0.05). Familial pancreatic cancer was noted in 15 cases (19%) and
comparison of the FPC cohort set to the genetic control set showed a 3-fold
increase in Y359Stop homozygous rates (p = 0.054). Overall in our cohort, the
homozygous genotype group was associated with increased risk of FPC (odds ratio
5.4; 95% CI 1.6 to 17.6; p < 0.01). Sex, age at diagnosis, and history of tobacco
use were not found to be significantly associated with FPC.
CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary data suggest a strong association between the IDO2
inactivating Y359Stop SNP and an increased risk of FPC when compared with the
control group. Future studies will evaluate the value of IDO2 genotyping as a
prognostic, early detection marker for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and a
predictive marker for novel immune checkpoint therapies.
