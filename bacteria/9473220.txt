The cellular isoform of the prion protein (PrPC) is a small glycoprotein attached
to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
anchor. This molecule is involved in the pathogenesis of prion diseases in both
humans and animals. We have characterized the expression patterns of PrPC during 
human leukocyte maturation by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies to PrPC, 
the glycan moiety CD15, and the stem cell marker CD34. We observe that prion
protein is present on CD34+ bone marrow (BM) stem cells. Although lymphocytes and
monocytes maintain PrPC expression throughout their differentiation, PrPC is
downregulated upon differentiation along the granulocyte lineage. In vitro
retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the premyeloid line HL-60 into
granulocyte-like cells mimics the suppression of PrPC in granulocyte
differentiation, as both PrPC mRNA and protein are downregulated. These data
suggest that selected BM cells and peripheral mononuclear cells may support prion
agent replication, because this process is dependent on availability of PrPC.
Additionally, retinoic acid-induced extinction of PrPC expression in HL-60 cells 
provides a potential model to study PrP gene regulation and protein function.
Finally, these data suggest the existence of cell-specific glycoforms of PrPC
that may determine cellular susceptibility to infection by the prion agent.
