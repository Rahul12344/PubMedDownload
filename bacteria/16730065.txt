Major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) genes are coordinately regulated by
conserved, upstream promoter elements that are bound cooperatively by cyclic AMP 
response element binding protein (CREB), regulatory factor X (RFX), and nuclear
factor Y (NF-Y). These DNA-binding proteins serve as a scaffold for the
transcriptional coactivator class II transactivator (CIITA). To determine how
CREB interacts with RFX and CIITA, co-immunoprecipitations and reporter assays
were performed using a variety of CREB mutants. These assays demonstrated that
CREB interacted with CIITA and the RFX5 subunit of RFX through the C-terminal
portion of CREB. This C-terminal portion of CREB was fully functional in MHC-II
promoter reporter assays. Phosphorylation of CREB enhanced transcription from the
reporter, but was not required for transcription. Phospho-CREB was found at the
HLA-DRA promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation, providing evidence for its
role. Together, these data provide genetic and biochemical evidence of the
specific associations between CREB and two elements of the MHC-II regulatory
complex and of the role played by phosphorylated CREB at MHC-II promoters.
