Background and purpose: The prevalence of leishmaniasis is reported in more than 
98 countries and Iran is one of the endemic areas. There is no vaccine for this
disease and few effective drugs are available to treat it. Moreover, drug
resistance to the disease is increasing. During the past decade, several in vitro
and in vivo studies have been performed on dihydropyrimidine derivatives as
antileishmanial agents.
Experimental approach: In the present project, a few 6-methyl-4-aryl-N-aryl
dihydropyrimidinone/thiones (A7-A11) and N-heteroaryl-3-(para-methoxy benzyl)
amino but-enamides (A1-A6) were synthesized, structurally characterized, and
finally subjected to in vitro anti-leishmanial effect against Leishmania major
promastigotes.
Findings / Results: Results of the study showed that compound A10,
4-(3-chlorophenyl)-6-methyl-N-phenyl-
2-thioxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxamide, exhibited superior
anti-leishmanial effect with IC50 value of 52.67 µg/mL (more active than standard
drug Glucantim® with IC50 71000 ± 390 µg/mL).
Conclusion and implications: It was demonstrated that some dihydropyrimidine
thiones were able to inhibit Leishmania major promastigotes. Structure-activity
relationship evaluations indicated that more electron-poor rings such as
isoxazole afforded higher activity within A1-A6 series and in these derivatives, 
N-benzothiazole rings reinforced anti-leishmanial activity concerning thiazole.
It was also observed that higher anti-parasite activities of A10 and A11
concerning A7-A9 might be related to the incorporation of the sulfur atom into C2
position, replacement of N-thiazole carboxamide by N-phenyl carboxamide on C5
position of dihydropyrimidine ring, and also replacement of para with
meta-substituted phenyls within C4 of dihydropyrimidine ring. The results may
help unveil new 4-aryl-5-carboxamide dihydropyrimidines as potential
anti-leishmanial agents and their further structural modification toward more
potent derivatives.
