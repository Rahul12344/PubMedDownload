OBJECTIVES: Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are
associated with high mortality. A relevant concern is the efficacy of antibiotic 
therapy in burn patients in whom pathophysiological changes strongly influence
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. This study aimed to describe the PK parameters
of meropenem in a population of burn patients.
METHODS: Blood samples were collected immediately before and 2 h and 5 h after
the start of intravenous drug administration. Plasma meropenem concentrations
were determined using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array
method.
RESULTS: Seventeen burn patients were enrolled in the study. Thirteen patients
(76%) were treated with meropenem for infections byPseudomonas aeruginosa or
Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from blood or wounds. Mean Cmax, Cmin, AUC0-24, 
half-life, drug clearance and volume of distribution were 28.9 mg/L, 3.7 mg/L,
280.2 mg h/L, 2.0 h, 19.0 L/h and 44.4 L, respectively. Six patients (35%)
achieved a Cmin ≥3.3 mg/L and seven patients (41%) achieved a Cmax ≥ 28.4 mg/L,
whilst nine patients (53%) achieved an AUC0-24 of >226 mg h/L. Given a minimum
inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5 mg/L, all patients satisfied the target
AUC/MIC of >125, but when the MIC rises to 2 mg/L (the ECOFF), only five patients
reached the desired AUC/MIC. Regarding fT>MIC at an MIC of 2 mg/L with a 2-h
infusion time, 13 patients (76%) achieved the PK target (>75%).
CONCLUSION: These data suggest that a combined 2-h infusion with a higher dosage 
of meropenem, including a loading dose, may be successful to achieve effective PK
parameters.
