The subunit light-harvesting 1 (LH 1) complexes isolated from photosynthetic
bacteria Rhodospirillum rubrum using n-octyl-beta-glucoside were reassociated and
adsorbed on a mica substrate using spin-coat methods with the aim of using this
LH complex in a nanodevice. The near-IR absorption and fluorescence spectra of
the LH 1 complexes indicated that the LH 1 complex on the mica was stable, and
efficient energy transfer from a carotenoid to a bacteriochlorophyll a was
observed. Atomic force microscopy of the reassociated LH 1 complexes, under air, 
showed the expected ringlike structure. The outer and inner diameters of the
ringlike structure of the LH 1 complex were approximately 30 and 8 nm,
respectively, and the ringlike structure protruded by 0.2-0.6 nm.
