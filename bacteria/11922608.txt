We identified a novel erythropoietin (Epo)-induced protein (CIP29) in lysates of 
human UT-7/Epo leukemia cells using two-dimensional gel analysis and cloned its
full-length cDNA. CIP29 contains 210 amino acids with a predicted MW of 24 kDa,
and has a N-terminal SAP DNA-binding motif. CIP29 expression was higher in cancer
and fetal tissues than in normal adult tissues. CIP29 mRNA expression is cytokine
regulated in hematopoietic cells, being up-regulated by Epo in UT7/Epo cells, and
by thrombopoietin (Tpo), FLT3 ligand (FL) and stem cell factor (SCF) in primary
human CD34(+) cells. Up-regulation of CIP29 in UT7/Epo cells by Epo was
associated with cell cycle progression but not with antiapoptosis. Epo withdrawal
reduced CIP29 expression concomitant with cell cycle arrest. Overexpression of
CIP29-GFP in HEK293 cells enhances cell cycle progression. CIP29 appears to be a 
new cytokine regulated protein involved in normal and cancer cell proliferation.
