Coincident production of IL-2 and induction of high-affinity IL-2R upon TCR
engagement has precluded a clear distinction for the biological outcome of
signaling through TCR/costimulatory molecules vs the IL-2R. Using a novel
transgenic mouse on the IL-2Rbeta(-/-) genetic background, this study has
separated the relative outcome of signaling through the TCR and IL-2R. We show
that stimulation through the TCR and CD28 or CD40 ligand directly leads to T cell
activation and several rounds of proliferation in an IL-2-independent fashion.
However, this stimulation is insufficient for extended T cell growth to multiple 
cytokines or differentiation into CTL or IFN-gamma-secreting effector T cells.
IL-2 is required for these functions in part by regulation of cyclin D3 and
granzyme B. Somewhat less efficiently, IL-4 stimulation of these transgenic T
cells redundantly rescued many of these activities. These data demonstrate a
fundamental requirement for IL-2 and perhaps other common gamma-chain-dependent
cytokines to promote selective gene expression by Ag-activated T cells for their 
subsequent growth and differentiation into effector T lymphocytes.
