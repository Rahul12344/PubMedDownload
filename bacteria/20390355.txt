The actinobacteria are arguably the richest source of small molecule diversity on
the planet. These compounds have an incredible variety of chemical structures and
biological activities (in nature and in the laboratory). Their potential for the 
development of therapeutic applications cannot be underestimated. It is suggested
that an improved understanding of the biological roles of low molecular weight
compounds in nature will lead to the discovery an inexhaustible supply of novel
therapeutic agents in the next decade. To support this objective, a functional
marriage of biochemistry, genomics, genetics, microbiology, and modern natural
product chemistry will be essential.
