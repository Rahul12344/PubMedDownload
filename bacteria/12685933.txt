BACKGROUND: p14ARF is a protein product of the alternative reading frame of the
human INK4a locus. It functions as a tumor suppressor protein. p14ARF suppresses 
growth through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways.
RESULTS: p14ARF protein localizes primarily to the nucleoli. Here we show that in
transfected cells p14ARF also appears in Hsp70 positive extranucleolar
inclusions. The formation of p14ARF inclusions induces the parallel
re-localization p53 and HDM2 to these sites that are also targeted by PML bodies 
and proteasomes.
CONCLUSION: Our data show that co-localization between p53, HDM2 and p14ARF
occurs at extranucleolar sites. Accumulation of PML and proteasomes at these
sites suggest that the components of the nuclear inclusions are targeted for
proteasome-mediated degradation.
