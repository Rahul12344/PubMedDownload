Type 1 diabetes (T1D) involves the interaction of multiple gene variants,
environmental factors, and immunoregulatory dysfunction. Major T1D genetic risk
loci encode HLA-DR and -DQ. Genetic heterogeneity and linkage disequilibrium in
the highly polymorphic HLA region confound attempts to identify additional T1D
susceptibility loci. To minimize HLA heterogeneity, T1D patients (N = 365) and
control subjects (N = 668) homozygous for the HLA-DR3 high-risk haplotype were
selected from multiple large T1D studies and examined to identify new T1D
susceptibility loci using molecular inversion probe sequencing technology. We
report that risk for T1D in HLA-DR3 homozygotes is increased significantly by a
previously unreported haplotype of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
within the first intron of HLA-DRA1. The homozygous risk haplotype has an odds
ratio of 4.65 relative to the protective homozygous haplotype in our sample.
Individually, these SNPs reportedly function as "expression quantitative trait
loci," modulating HLA-DR and -DQ expression. From our analysis of available data,
we conclude that the tri-SNP haplotype within HLA-DRA1 may modulate class II
expression, suggesting that increased T1D risk could be attributable to regulated
expression of class II genes. These findings could help clarify the role of HLA
in T1D susceptibility and improve diabetes risk assessment, particularly in
high-risk HLA-DR3 homozygous individuals.
