INTRODUCTION: Bacterial pathogens are often involved in dermatitis in reptiles.
Exact identification of reptile-specific but otherwise uncommon bacterial species
may be challenging. However, identification is crucial to evaluate the importance
of the detected bacterial species.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the number of aerobic bacterial
isolates cultured from skin-derived samples of reptiles which were not reliably
identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and to determine their identity.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Routine bacterial diagnostics were performed on 235 skin
samples, and 417 bacterial isolates were analysed by MALDI-TOF MS. The isolates
were grouped into categories based on their first score: category I (≥ 2.00),
category II (≥ 1.70 and < 2.00), and category III (< 1.70). Isolates from
category III were further investigated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the
following criteria were applied: query cover 100%, e-value rounded to 0.0 and
sequence identity (%) > 98.00% for genus identification, and > 99.00% for species
identification.
RESULTS: The majority of bacterial isolates were in category I (85.1%) or
category II (8.4%). In category III (6.5%) results achieved at first by MALDI-TOF
MS corresponded to the results of the molecular analysis in 8.0% of isolates at
the species level and in 24.0% at the genus level. Bacterial isolates classified 
as category III were heterogenic in genus (e.g. Chryseobacterium, Devriesea,
Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Uruburuella), and some have only been described in
reptiles so far.
CONCLUSIONS: Most of the aerobic bacterial isolates cultured from reptile skin
achieved high scores by MALDI-TOF MS. However, in the majority of category III
isolates MALDI-TOF MS results were different from those of the molecular
analysis. This strengthens the need to carefully examine low-scored results for
plausibility and to be familiar with the occurrence and morphology of relevant
reptile-specific bacterial species (e.g. Devriesea agamarum) as well as with the 
limits of the database used.
