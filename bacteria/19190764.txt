Chronic brucellosis patients display a defective Th1 response to PHA. We have
previously shown that heat-killed B. abortus (HKBA) can downregulate the
PHA-induced increase of CD4+/CD25+ and CD14+/CD80+ cells of brucellosis patients.
In the present study, we investigate the effect of E. coli LPS, as a potent
stimulant of monocytes and autologous T-lymphocytes, on the PHA-cultured PBMCs of
the same groups of patients. Thirteen acute brucellosis (AB) patients, 22 chronic
brucellosis (CB) patients, 11 "cured" subjects, and 15 healthy volunteers were
studied. The percentage of CD4+/CD25+ and CD4+/CD28+ T-lymphocytes as well as
CD14+/CD80+ monocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry after PBMCs culture with
PHA plus E. coli LPS. A significant decrease in the percentage of CD4+/CD25+ and 
CD4+/CD28+ T-lymphocytes was observed in CB compared to AB. In HKBA cultures,
compared to E. coli LPS-cultures, there was a significant reduction of CD4+/CD25+
T-lymphocytes in all groups and CD14+/CD80+ in patients groups. We suggest that
Brucella can modulate host immune response, leading to T-cell anergy and chronic 
infection.
