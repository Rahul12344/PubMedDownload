Migration to intestinal mucosa putatively depends on local activation because
gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue induces expression of intestinal homing
molecules, whereas skin-draining lymph nodes do not. This paradigm is difficult
to reconcile with reports of intestinal T cell responses after alternative routes
of immunization. We reconcile this discrepancy by demonstrating that activation
within spleen results in intermediate induction of homing potential to the
intestinal mucosa. We further demonstrate that memory T cells within small
intestine epithelium do not routinely recirculate with memory T cells in other
tissues, and we provide evidence that homing is similarly dynamic in humans after
subcutaneous live yellow fever vaccine immunization. These data explain why
systemic immunization routes induce local cell-mediated immunity within the
intestine and indicate that this tissue must be seeded with memory T cell
precursors shortly after activation.
