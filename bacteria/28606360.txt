Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Sex differences, 
including smaller infarcts in females and greater involvement of immune-mediated 
inflammation in males may affect the efficacy of immune-modulating interventions.
To address these differences, we sought to identify distinct stroke-modifying
mechanisms in female vs. male mice. The current study demonstrated smaller
infarcts and increased levels of regulatory CD19+CD5+CD1dhi B10 cells as well as 
anti-inflammatory CD11b+CD206+ microglia/macrophages in the ipsilateral vs.
contralateral hemisphere of female but not male mice undergoing 60min middle
cerebral artery occlusion followed by 96h of reperfusion. Moreover, female mice
with MCAO had increased total spleen cell numbers but lower B10 levels in
spleens. These results elucidate differing sex-dependent regulatory mechanisms
that account for diminished stroke severity in females and underscore the need to
test immune-modulating therapies for stroke in both males and females.
