Ferritin-like carboxylate-bridged non-heme diiron enzymes activate O2 for a
variety of difficult reactions throughout nature. These reactions often begin by 
abstraction of hydrogen from strong CH bonds. The enzymes activate O2 at their
diferrous cofactors to form canonical diferric peroxo intermediates, with a range
of possible coordination modes. Herein, we explore the ability of high-energy
resolution fluorescence detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (HERFD XAS) to
provide insight into the nature of peroxo level intermediates in non-heme diiron 
proteins. Freeze quenched (FQ) peroxo intermediates from p-aminobenzoate
N-oxygenase (AurF), aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO), and the β subunit of 
class Ia ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli (Ecβ) are investigated.
All three intermediates are proposed to adopt different peroxo binding modes, and
each exhibit different Fe Kα HERFD XAS pre-edge features and intensities. As
these FQ-trapped samples consist of multiple species, deconvolution of HERFD XAS 
spectra based on speciation, as determined by Mössbauer spectroscopy, is also
necessitated - yielding 'pure' diferric peroxo HERFD XAS spectra from dilute
protein samples. Finally, the impact of a given peroxo coordination mode on the
HERFD XAS pre-edge energy and intensity is evaluated through time-dependent
density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of the XAS spectra on a series of 
hypothetical model complexes, which span a full range of possible peroxo
coordination modes to a diferric core. The utility of HERFD XAS for future
studies of enzymatic intermediates is discussed.
