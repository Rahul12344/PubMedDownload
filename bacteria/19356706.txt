Cellular transformation is the first step in cancer development. Two features of 
cellular transformation are proliferation in reduced serum and loss of contact
inhibition. Electronic Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) measurements have 
been used to measure cellular proliferation, cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and
attachment. We have used impedance measurements to distinguish normal cells from 
cells transformed with a constitutively active chemokine receptor, CXCR2. CXCR2, 
a member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family, is normally involved in
cellular activation and migration, but a single amino acid substitution leads to 
constitutive activity. NIH3T3 cells were transformed with a constitutively active
CXCR2 (D143V_CXCR2) and growth in reduced serum and foci formation were measured 
using established biological assays and compared to data from ECIS. The results
of this study show that impedance measurements provide a quick and reliable way
of measuring cellular transformation and provide real time assessment of
transformed cellular parameters. Use of the ECIS system could allow a rapid
screening of anti-cancer drugs that alter cellular transformation.
