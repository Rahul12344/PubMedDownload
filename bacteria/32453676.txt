Diversity-focused committees continue to play essential roles in the efforts of
professional scientific societies to foster inclusion and facilitate the
professional development of underrepresented minority (URM) young scientists in
their respective scientific disciplines. Until recently, the efforts of these
committees have remained independent and disconnected from one another. Funding
from the National Science Foundation has allowed several of these committees to
come together and form the Alliance to Catalyze Change for Equity in STEM
Success, herein referred to as ACCESS. The overall goal of this meta-organization
is to create a community in which diversity-focused committees can interact,
synergize, share their collective experiences, and have a unified voice on behalf
of URM trainees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines.
In this Essay, we compare and contrast the broad approaches that scientific
societies in ACCESS use to implement and assess their travel award programs for
URM trainees. We also report a set of recommendations, including both short- and 
long-term outcomes assessment in populations of interest and specialized
programmatic activities coupled to travel award programs.
