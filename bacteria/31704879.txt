Foxp3+T regulatory cells (Tregs) control autoimmune response by suppressing
proliferation and effector functions of self-reactive Foxp3-CD4+/CD8+ T cells and
thereby maintain the critical balance between self-tolerance and autoimmunity.
Earlier, we had shown that OX40L-JAG1 cosignaling mediated through their cognate 
receptors OX40 and Notch3 preferentially expressed on murine Tregs can
selectively induce their proliferation in the absence of TCR stimulation.
However, the differential molecular mechanisms regulating TCR-independent versus 
TCR-dependent Treg proliferation and lineage stability of the expanded Tregs
remained unknown. In this study, we show that OX40L-JAG1 treatment induced
TCR-independent proliferation of Tregs in the thymus and periphery. The use of
Src kinase inhibitor permitted us to demonstrate selective inhibition of
TCR-dependent T cell proliferation with little to no effect on OX40L-JAG1-induced
TCR-independent Treg expansion in vitro, which was critically dependent on
noncanonical NF-κB signaling. OX40L-JAG1-expanded Tregs showed sustained lineage 
stability as indicated by stable demethylation marks in Treg signature genes such
as Foxp3, Il2ra, Ctla4, Ikzf2, and Ikzf4. Furthermore, OX40L-JAG1 treatment
significantly increased CTLA4+ and TIGIT+ Tregs and alleviated experimental
autoimmune thyroiditis in mice. Relevance of our findings to humans became
apparent when human OX40L and JAG1 induced TCR-independent selective expansion of
human Tregs in thymocyte cultures and increased human Tregs in the liver tissue
of humanized NSG mice. Our findings suggest that OX40L-JAG1-induced
TCR-independent Treg proliferation is a conserved mechanism that can be used to
expand lineage-stable Tregs to treat autoimmune diseases.
