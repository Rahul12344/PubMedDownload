This study aims at evaluating the impacts of PAM addition on activated sludge
performance. Four lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs), each with a working
volume of 3L, were investigated with different PAM concentrations. Experiments
were conducted with varying organic loading rate and the sludge volume index
(SVI), particle size, zeta potential, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR), mixed
liquor suspended solids (MLSS), COD and ammonium removal efficiency were
monitored over a 105-day period. The results showed that all of the PAM addition 
not only improved the removal efficiencies of COD and ammonium, but also
exhibited some advantages on sludge performance. It was found that the sludge
performance of settling property, flocculation and microbial activity increased
with increasing concentration of PAM. However, high level of PAM (1mg/L) led to
the formation of large amounts of loose-structure flocs, which eliminated
dissolved oxygen transfer and caused the sludge disintegration, resulting in bad 
settleability and lower microbial activity. In this way, when the dosage of PAM
was 0.1mg/L, the sludge had the best settling property and activity.
