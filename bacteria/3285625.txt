For the detection of C. jejuni and C. coli in waste water the content of
rifampicin in selective media was reduced from 10 micrograms/ml (Bolton and
Robertson 1982) to 5 micrograms/ml and the content of polymymyxin B was increased
from 0,25 microliter/ml (Skirrow 1977) to 2.5 micrograms/ml. On the Basis of this
modification the isolation of C. jejuni and C. coli from waste water samples by
membrane filter technique as well as by enrichment procedure was possible. Before
inoculation of waste water samples the enrichment broth was preincubated at least
1 d at 37 degrees C under microaerophilic conditions. The Campylobacter test
strains showed significant differences of growth between preincubated and non
preincubated enrichment broth in the first hours of incubation.
