Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are major type-I interferon-producing cells
that play important roles in antiviral immunity and tolerance induction. These
cells share a common DC progenitor with conventional DCs, and Fms-like tyrosine
kinase-3 ligand is essential for their development. Several subsets of pDCs have 
been identified to date including CCR9(+) , CD9(+) , and CD2(+) pDCs. Recently,
three subsets of pDCs were described, namely CD8α(-) β(-) , CD8α(+) β(-) , and
CD8α(+) β(+) subsets. Interestingly, CD8α(+) β(-) and CD8α(+) β(+) but not
CD8α(-) β(-) pDCs were shown to have tolerogenic effects in experimentally
induced allergic asthma. These tolerogenic effects were shown to be mediated by
the generation of FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells through retinoic acid and the
induction of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes. These newly described subsets
of pDCs show high potentials for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment
of allergic diseases. In this review, we will address the new progress in our
understanding of pDC biology with respect to allergic disease, in particular
allergic asthma.
