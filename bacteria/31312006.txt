Clonal lineages of ESBL (Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase)-producing E. coli
belonging to sequence type 131 (ST131) have disseminated globally during the last
30 years, leading to an increased prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones
and extended-spectrum cephalosporins in clinical isolates of E. coli. We aimed to
study if Swedish ESBL-producing ST131 isolates originated from single or multiple
introductions to the population by assessing the amount of genetic variation, on 
chromosomal and plasmid level, between Swedish and international E. coli ST131.
Bayesian inference of Swedish E. coli ST131 isolates (n = 29), sequenced using
PacBio RSII, together with an international ST131 dataset showed that the Swedish
isolates were part of the international ST131 A, C1 and C2 clades. Highly
conserved plasmids were identified in three clusters although they were separated
by several years, which indicates a strong co-evolution between some ST131
lineages and specific plasmids. In conclusion, the tight clonal relationship
observed within the ST131 clades, together with highly conserved plasmids,
challenges investigation of strain transmission events. A combination of few SNPs
on a genome-wide scale and an epidemiological temporospatial link, are needed to 
track the spread of the ST131 subclones.
