The NEIL3 DNA glycosylase is a base excision repair enzyme that excises bulky
base lesions from DNA. Although NEIL3 has been shown to unhook interstrand
crosslinks (ICL) in Xenopus extracts, how NEIL3 participants in ICL repair in
human cells and its corporation with the canonical Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA
pathway remain unclear. Here we show that the NEIL3 and the FA/BRCA pathways are 
non-epistatic in psoralen-ICL repair. The NEIL3 pathway is the major pathway for 
repairing psoralen-ICL, and the FA/BRCA pathway is only activated when NEIL3 is
not present. Mechanistically, NEIL3 is recruited to psoralen-ICL in a rapid,
PARP-dependent manner. Importantly, the NEIL3 pathway repairs psoralen-ICLs
without generating double-strand breaks (DSBs), unlike the FA/BRCA pathway. In
addition, we found that the RUVBL1/2 complex physically interact with NEIL3 and
function within the NEIL3 pathway in psoralen-ICL repair. Moreover, TRAIP is
important for the recruitment of NEIL3 but not FANCD2, and knockdown of TRAIP
promotes FA/BRCA pathway activation. Interestingly, TRAIP is non-epistatic with
both NEIL3 and FA pathways in psoralen-ICL repair, suggesting that TRAIP may
function upstream of the two pathways. Taken together, the NEIL3 pathway is the
major pathway to repair psoralen-ICL through a unique DSB-free mechanism in human
cells.
