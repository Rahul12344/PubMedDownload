Androgens are known to protect prostate cancer cells from DNA damage. Recent
studies showed regulation of DNA repair genes by androgen receptor signaling in
prostate cancers. ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) is an androgen-regulated tumor
suppressor and its intracellular localization can be modulated by ultraviolet
light, suggesting a potential role for EAF2 in androgen regulation of DNA repair 
in prostate cancer cells. Here we show that knockdown of EAF2 or its homolog EAF1
sensitized prostate cancer cells to DNA damage and the sensitization did not
require p53. EAF2 knockout mouse prostate was also sensitized to γ-irradiation.
Furthermore, EAF2 knockdown blocked androgen repression of LNCaP or C4-2 cells
from doxorubicin induction of γH2ax, a DNA damage marker. In human prostate
cancer specimens, EAF2 expression was inversely correlated with the level of
γH2ax. Further analysis showed that EAF2 and EAF1 are required for the
recruitment and retention of Ku70/Ku80 to DNA damage sites and play a functional 
role in nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair. These findings provide evidence for
EAF2 as a key factor mediating androgen protection of DNA damage via Ku70/Ku80 in
prostate cancer cells.
