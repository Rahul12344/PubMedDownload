BACKGROUND: It was the aim of this study to evaluate the antibacterial impact of 
two silver(I) carbohydrate complexes with tripodal thioglycosides, namely
tris[2-(β-D-thio-glucopyranosyl)ethyl]-amine-silver(I)-nitrate (3) and
tris[2-(α-D-thio-manno-pyranosyl)ethyl]-amine-silver(I)-nitrate (4), on five oral
pathogenic bacterial strains. Furthermore, cytocompatibility was tested using
human gingival fibroblasts (HGF).
METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined on five oral
pathogenic bacterial strains by using the broth microdilution method:
Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (ATCC
33384), Porphyromonas gingivalis (ATCC 33277), Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) 
and Enterococcus faecalis (DSMZ 20376). Furthermore, antimicrobial efficiency was
tested using agar diffusion assays. To evaluate cytocompatibility, human gingival
fibroblasts (HGFs) were exposed to AgNO3 and complex 3 followed by a live/dead
staining.
RESULTS: MIC of the silver(I) complexes ranged between 0.625 and 5.0 mmol/L. The 
silver complexes 3 and 4 showed higher antibacterial efficiency against all
tested species than AgNO3. Antibacterial efficiency of complexes 3 and 4 on F.
nucleatum (≥18 mm) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (≥23 mm) was more pronounced than
against P. gingivalis (≥15 mm). Complex 3 (20 mM) induced the largest inhibition 
zones (30 to 31 mm) on Gram-negative strains. For Gram-positive strains, the
largest inhibition zones were achieved by complex 3 (20 mM/S. mutans: 28 mm, E.
faecalis: 18 mm). Complex 3 had a lower cytotoxic impact on HGFs compared to
AgNO3 by the power of ten.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that silver(I) carbohydrate complexes 3 and 4
might function as novel antimicrobial agents for the treatment of periodontal,
carious or endodontic diseases.
