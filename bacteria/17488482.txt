The cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in many abnormalities described in
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are still unclear. Some of these abnormalities
referred to the hyperactivation of T lymphocytes and the enhanced secretion of
MMP-9 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Therefore, in this paper we 
investigated the potential role of CD147 molecule in these abnormalities. Our
results demonstrated that CD147 molecule is overexpressed on CD3+T lymphocytes
from SLE patients when compared with CD3+T lymphocytes from healthy donors.
Monoclonal anti-CD147 antibodies, MEM-M6/1 clone, were able to inhibit protein
tyrosine phosphorylation only in CD3 x CD28 costimulated T lymphocytes from SLE
patients. However, this monoclonal antibody was unable to inhibit the enhanced
activity of MMP-9 secreted by SLE PBMCs.
