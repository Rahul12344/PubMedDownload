Micromotors are man-made nano/microscale devices capable of transforming energy
into mechanical motion. The accessibility and force offered by micromotors hold
great promise to solve complex biomedical challenges. This Review highlights
current progress and prospects in the use of nano and micromotors for diagnosis
and treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. Motion-based sensing and
fluorescence switching detection strategies along with therapeutic approaches
based on direct cell capture; killing by direct contact or specific drug delivery
to the affected site, will be comprehensively covered. Future challenges to
translate the potential of nano/micromotors into practical applications will be
described in the conclusions.
