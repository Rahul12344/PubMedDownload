G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) control the signaling and activation of
G protein-coupled receptors through phosphorylation. In this study, consensus
substrate motifs for GRK2 were identified from the sequences of GRK2 protein
substrates, and 17 candidate peptides were synthesized to identify peptide
substrates with high affinity for GRK2. GRK2 appears to require an acidic amino
acid at the -2, -3, or -4 positions and its consensus phosphorylation site motifs
were identified as (D/E)X1-3(S/T), (D/E)X1-3(S/T)(D/E), or (D/E)X0-2(D/E)(S/T).
Among the 17 peptide substrates examined, a 13-amino-acid peptide fragment of
β-tubulin (DEMEFTEAESNMN) showed the highest affinity for GRK2 (Km, 33.9 μM;
Vmax, 0.35 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)), but very low affinity for GRK5. This peptide may
be a useful tool for investigating cellular signaling pathways regulated by GRK2.
