Natural phosphodiester bond CpG-DNA that contains immunomodulatory CpG motifs
(PO-DNA) upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and induces an
Ag-driven Th1 response in a CG sequence-dependent manner in mice. In humans, only
phosphorothioate backbone-modified CpG-DNA (PS-DNA) and not PO-DNA has
immunomodulatory activity. In this study, we found that liposome-encapsulated
PO-DNA upregulated the expression of human Beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) and major
histocompatibility class II molecules (HLA-DRA) in a CG sequence-dependent and
liposome- dependent manner in human B cells. Of the three different liposomes,
DOTAP has the unique ability to enhance the immunomodulatory activity of PO-DNA. 
In contrast, HLA-DRA and hBD-2 promoter activation can be induced by
liposomeencapsulated PS-DNA in a CG sequence-independent manner, depending on the
CpG-DNA species. Our observations demonstrate that, when encapsulated with a
proper liposome in the immune system, natural PO-DNA has the potential to be a
useful therapy for the regulation of the innate immune response.
