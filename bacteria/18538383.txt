BACKGROUND: Individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) have frequent colonization
and infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Rapid elimination of S. aureus depends 
on constitutive synthesis and mobilization of human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3).
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether keratinocytes in AD, compared with normal, skin
are less able to kill S. aureus rapidly, and to assess the potential role that
abnormally low mobilization of HBD-3 onto S. aureus has in this process.
METHODS: Skin samples from 10 normal individuals and 10 patients with AD were
compared for synthesis and mobilization of HBD-3 onto surface-associated S.
aureus. Furthermore, keratinocytes from 10 individuals were studied for the
effects of T(H)2 cytokines on the ability of the cells to synthesize and mobilize
HBD-3, and to kill S. aureus.
RESULTS: Keratinocytes in skin biopsies from subjects with AD were defective in
killing S. aureus relative to normal individuals (P < .001). The constitutive
levels of HBD-3 in the epidermal keratinocytes were similar between normal
individuals and those with AD. However, the cells of patients with AD were unable
to mobilize HBD-3 efficiently to kill S. aureus. Physiologic Ca(++) was essential
for development of normal HBD-3 levels by cultured human keratinocytes.
Mobilization of HBD-3 and the ability to kill S. aureus were significantly (P <
.05) inhibited by IL-4 and IL-13. Antagonism of IL-4/10/13 with antibodies
significantly (P < .01) improved mobilization of HBD-3 onto the surface of S.
aureus by skin from patients with AD.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AD have problems with S. aureus skin infection. This is
a result of increased levels of T(H)2 cytokines, which inhibit keratinocyte
mobilization of HBD-3.
