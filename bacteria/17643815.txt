Inactivation of Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway in some cancers causes increased
sensitivity to various drugs used for chemo-therapy. Several approaches have been
suggested to artificially disrupt this pathway for better treatment. In our
study, we have utilized RNA interference technique to knock-down the expression
of FANCD2 and sensitize cancer cells undergoing treatment with DNA damaging
agents. For this purpose, we transiently depleted FANCD2 by siRNA in a number of 
breast, bladder, or liver cancer cell lines and screened for mitomycin C or
gamma-irradiation sensitivity changes. We could show that knocking-down FANCD2
gene expression increases sensitivity of cancer cells to mitomycin C and to less 
extent to gamma-rays. Importantly, this effect strongly correlates to
repopulation ability of cancer cells and those cell lines with significant FANCD2
depletion revealed decreased recurrence capacity. In summary, the results we
presented show proof of principle that opens new possibilities for further
preclinical trials.
