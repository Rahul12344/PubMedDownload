In the preceding manuscript [ Moreau et al. 2018 , 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.7b01691 ]
we described a successful fragment-based lead discovery (FBLD) strategy for
discovery of bacterial phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase inhibitors (PPAT,
CoaD). Following several rounds of optimization two promising lead compounds were
identified: triazolopyrimidinone 3 and 4-azabenzimidazole 4. Here we disclose our
efforts to further optimize these two leads for on-target potency and
Gram-negative cellular activity. Enabled by a robust X-ray crystallography
system, our structure-based inhibitor design approach delivered compounds with
biochemical potencies 4-5 orders of magnitude greater than their respective
fragment starting points. Additional optimization was guided by observations on
bacterial permeability and physicochemical properties, which ultimately led to
the identification of PPAT inhibitors with cellular activity against wild-type E.
