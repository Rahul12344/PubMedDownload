Mice sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) develop allergic airway disease (AAD) with
short-term daily OVA aerosol challenge; inflammation resolves with long-term OVA 
aerosol exposure, resulting in local inhalational tolerance (LIT). Cbl-b is an E3
ubiquitin ligase involved with CD28 signaling; Cbl-b(-/-) effector T cells are
resistant to regulatory T cell-mediated suppression in vitro and in vivo. The
present study utilized Cbl-b(-/-) mice to investigate the role of Cbl-b in the
development of AAD and LIT. Cbl-b(-/-) mice exhibited increased airway
inflammation during AAD, which failed to resolve with long-term OVA aerosol
exposure. Exacerbation of inflammation in Cbl-b(-/-) mice correlated with
increased proinflammatory cytokine levels and expansion of effector T cells in
the BAL during AAD, but did not result in either a modulation of lymphocyte
subsets in systemic tissues or in OVA-specific IgE in serum. These results
implicate a role for Cbl-b in the resolution of allergic airway inflammation.
