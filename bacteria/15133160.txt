The use of bicistronic vectors, which contain two target genes under one
promoter, has been the most common practice for the heterologous production of
binary protein complexes. The major problem of this method is the much lower
expression of the second gene compared with that of the first gene next to the
promoter. We tested a simple idea of whether inclusion of an additional promoter 
in front of the second gene may remove the problem. Compared with bicistronic
vectors, corresponding two-promoter vectors yielded four to nine times larger
amounts of the complexes between BCL-2 family proteins, BCL-X(L):BAD,
BCL-X(L):BIM-S, and CED-9:EGL-1 in bacterial cells as a result of significantly
increased expression of the second genes in a manner independent of the order of 
the target genes. With the two-promoter system, we produced two other complexes
in large quantity suitable for extensive crystallization trial. The method does
not accompany any technical disadvantages, and represents a significant
improvement from the conventional method, which should enjoy wide application for
the coexpression of binary or higher order protein complexes by extension.
