In the absence of exogenous promoters, plasmid-mediated complementation of the
temperature-sensitive ftsW201 allele requires the presence of the full coding
sequence of ftsW plus upstream DNA encompassing the C-terminus of mraY and the
full coding sequence of murD. We used molecular and genetic techniques to
introduce an insertional inactivation into the chromosomal copy of ftsW, in the
presence of the plasmid-borne wild-type ftsW gene under the control of P(BAD). In
the absence of arabinose, the ftsW-null strain is not viable, and a shift from
arabinose- to glucose-containing liquid medium resulted in a block in division,
followed by cell lysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that in ftsW-null 
filaments, the FtsZ ring is absent in 50-60% of filaments, whilst between one and
three Z-rings per filament can be detected in the remainder of the population,
with the majority of these containing only one Z-ring per filament. We also
demonstrated that the expression of only ftsWS (the smaller of two ftsW open
reading frames) from P(BAD) is sufficient for complementation of the ftsW-null
allele. We conclude that FtsW is an essential cell-division protein in
Escherichia coli, and that it plays a role in the stabilization of the FtsZ ring 
during cell division.
