BACKGROUND: It is clinically important to maintain high viability and potency of 
umbilical cord blood units (CBUs) for transplantation during thawing. In the
absence of a standard thawing protocol, this study was designed to develop one
based on the consensus practice of transplant centers and address the shortage of
dextran 40 thawing solution.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Frozen CBU aliquots were thawed using dextran 40
thawing solution while manipulating temperature and volume of diluent and mode of
dilution. The effects of these on CD45+ and CD34+ cell viability were measured
through annexin V and SYTOX green staining. The developed protocol was then used 
to compare dextran 40 and PLASMA-LYTE A thawing solutions and finally tested on
whole CBUs.
RESULTS: Step-by-step investigations resulted in the development of a protocol
that thaws and dilutes CBUs with room temperature diluent to five times the
original volume using two sequential dilutions separated by equilibration times. 
PLASMA-LYTE A diluent provided superior viability of CD45+ and CD34+ cells than
dextran 40 and recovered more colony-forming units. However, both diluents were
equally effective in maintaining stability of the thawed CBU for 4 hours.
Moreover, the stem cell-enriched CD34+CD38- subpopulations appeared more
resistant to cryoinjuries than their CD34+CD38+ counterpart.
CONCLUSION: The developed thawing protocol recovers viable CD45+ and CD34+ cells 
above the standard thresholds and maintains CBU potency. PLASMA-LYTE A for
thawing solution proved to be an efficient alternative to dextran 40. Finally,
greater dilution should be avoided to maintain the viability of CD45+ cells and
maximize graft cell dose.
