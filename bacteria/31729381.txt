Type IV pilus-like systems are protein complexes that polymerize pilin fibres.
They are critical for virulence in many bacterial pathogens. Pilin polymerization
and depolymerization are powered by motor ATPases of the PilT/VirB11-like family.
This family is thought to operate with C2 symmetry; however, most of these
ATPases crystallize with either C3 or C6 symmetric conformations. The relevance
of these conformations is unclear. Here, we determine the X-ray structures of
PilT in four unique conformations and use these structures to classify the
conformation of available PilT/VirB11-like family member structures. Single
particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) structures of PilT reveal
condition-dependent preferences for C2, C3, and C6 conformations. The physiologic
importance of these conformations is validated by coevolution analysis and
functional studies of point mutants, identifying a rare gain-of-function mutation
that favours the C2 conformation. With these data, we propose a comprehensive
model of PilT function with broad implications for PilT/VirB11-like family
members.
