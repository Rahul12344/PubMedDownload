The D-Ala-D-Ala adding enzyme (MurF) from Streptococcus pneumoniae catalyzes the 
ATP-dependent formation of the UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide, a critical component of
the bacterial cell wall. MurF is a potential target for antibacterial design
because it is unique to bacteria and performs an essential non-redundant function
in the bacterial cell. The recent discovery and subsequent cocrystal structure
determination of MurF in complex with a new class of inhibitors served as a
catalyst to begin a medicinal chemistry program aimed at improving their potency.
We report here a multidisciplinary approach to this effort that allowed for rapid
generation of cocrystal structures, thereby providing the crystallographic
information critical for driving the inhibitor optimization process. This effort 
resulted in the discovery of low-nanomolar inhibitors of this bacterial enzyme.
