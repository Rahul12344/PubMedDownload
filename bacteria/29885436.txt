A novel apicomplexan parasite was serendipitously discovered in horses at the
United States - Mexico border. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rDNA showed the
erythrocyte-infective parasite to be related to, but distinct from, Theileria
spp. in Africa, the most similar taxa being Theileria spp. from waterbuck and
mountain zebra. The degree of sequence variability observed at the 18S rDNA locus
also suggests the likely existence of additional cryptic species. Among described
species, the genome of this novel equid Theileria parasite is most similar to
that of Theileria equi, also a pathogen of horses. The estimated divergence time 
between the new Theileria sp. and T. equi, based on genomic sequence data, is
greater than 33â€¯million years. Average protein sequence divergence between them, 
at 23%, is greater than that of Theileria parva and Theileria annulata proteins, 
which is 18%. The latter two represent highly virulent Theileria spp. of domestic
cattle, as well as of African and Asian wild buffalo, respectively, which differ 
markedly in pathology, host cell tropism, tick vector and geographical
distribution. The extent of genome-wide sequence divergence, as well as
significant morphological differences, relative to T. equi justify the
classification of Theileria sp. as a new taxon. Despite the overall genomic
divergence, the nine member equi merozoite antigen (EMA) superfamily, previously 
found as a multigene family only in T. equi, is also present in the novel
parasite. Practically, significant sequence divergence in antigenic loci resulted
in this undescribed Theileria sp. not being detectable using currently available 
diagnostic tests. Discovery of this novel species infective to equids highlights 
exceptional diversity within the genus Theileria, a finding with serious
implications for apicomplexan parasite surveillance.
