Human β defensin-3 (hBD-3), an epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial peptide,
mediates chemotaxis and activation of myeloid cells. In this study, we provide
evidence that hBD-3 induces the costimulatory molecule CD86 on primary human
monocytes by a mechanism involving autocrine activation of ionotropic P2X7
receptors (P2X7R) by ATP. Incubation of monocytes with hBD-3 resulted in
increased expression of both the CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules. Treatment
of monocytes with a selective P2X7R antagonist inhibited the ability of hBD-3 to 
induce expression of CD86 but not CD80. The hBD-3-dependent upregulation of CD86 
was also attenuated in monocytes incubated with apyrase, a potent scavenger of
extracellular ATP. Finally, direct activation of monocyte P2X7R by exogenous ATP 
mimicked the ability of hBD-3 to induce CD86 expression. These data suggest that 
hBD-3 induces monocyte activation by both P2X7-dependent (CD86 upregulation) and 
P2X7-independent (CD80 upregulation) signaling mechanisms and raise the
possibility that activation of P2X7R could play an important role in shaping the 
inflammatory microenvironment in conditions where hBD-3 is highly expressed, such
as psoriasis or oral carcinoma.
