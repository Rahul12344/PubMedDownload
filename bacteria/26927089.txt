The potential of two zygomycetes fungi, Mucor indicus and Rhizopus oryzae, in
assimilating citrus waste free sugars (CWFS) and producing fungal chitosan, oil, 
and protein as well as ethanol was investigated. Extraction of free sugars from
citrus waste can reduce its environmental impact by decreasing the possibility of
wild microorganisms growth and formation of bad odors, a typical problem facing
the citrus industries. A total sugar concentration of 25.1 g/L was obtained by
water extraction of citrus waste at room temperature, used for fungal cultivation
in shake flasks and airlift bioreactor with no additional nutrients. In shake
flasks cultivations, the fungi were only able to assimilate glucose, while
fructose remained almost intact. In contrast, the cultivation of M. indicus and
R. oryzae in the four-liter airlift bioreactor resulted in the consumption of
almost all sugars and production of 250 and 280 g fungal biomass per kg of
consumed sugar, respectively. These biomasses correspondingly contained 40% and
51% protein and 9.8% and 4.4% oil. Furthermore, the fungal cell walls, obtained
after removing the alkali soluble fraction of the fungi, contained 0.61 and 0.69 
g chitin and chitosan per g of cell wall for M. indicus and R. oryzae,
respectively. Moreover, the maximum ethanol yield of 36% and 18% was obtained
from M. indicus and R. oryzae, respectively. Furthermore, that M. indicus grew as
clump mycelia in the airlift bioreactor, while R. oryzae formed spherical
suspended pellets, is a promising feature towards industrialization of the
process.
