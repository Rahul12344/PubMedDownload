This study was conducted to analyze the gene expression of prognostic potential
biomarker candidates using the whole blood of cattle naturally infected with
ITALIC! Mycobacterium aviumsubsp. ITALIC! paratuberculosis(MAP). We conducted
real-time PCR to evaluate 23 potential biomarker candidates. Experimental animals
were divided into four groups based on fecal MAP PCR and serum ELISA. Seven (
ITALIC! KLRB1, ITALIC! HGF, ITALIC! MPO, ITALIC! LTF, ITALIC! SERPINE1, ITALIC!
S100A8and ITALIC! S100A9) genes were up-regulated in fecal MAP-positive cattle
and three ( ITALIC! KLRB1, ITALIC! MPOand ITALIC! S100A9) were up-regulated in
MAP-seropositive cattle relative to uninfected cattle. In subclinically infected 
animals, 17 genes ( ITALIC! TFRC, ITALIC! S100A8, ITALIC! S100A9, ITALIC! MPO,
ITALIC! GBP6, ITALIC! LTF, ITALIC! KLRB1, ITALIC! SERPINE1, ITALIC! PIGR, ITALIC!
IL-10, ITALIC! CXCR3, ITALIC! CD14, ITALIC! MMP9, ITALIC! ELANE, ITALIC! CHI3L1, 
ITALIC! HPand ITALIC! HGF) were up-regulated compared with the control group.
Moreover, six genes ( ITALIC! CXCR3, ITALIC! HP, ITALIC! HGF, ITALIC! LTF,
ITALIC! TFRCand ITALIC! GBP6) showed significant differences between experimental
groups. Taken together, our data suggest that six genes ( ITALIC! LTF, ITALIC!
HGF, ITALIC! HP, ITALIC! CXCR3, ITALIC! GBP6and ITALIC! TFRC) played essential
roles in the immune response to MAP during the subclinical stage and therefore
might be useful as prognostic biomarkers.
