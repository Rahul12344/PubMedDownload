In pathogenic bacteria, a large number of sRNAs coordinate adaptation to stress
and expression of virulence genes. To better understand the turnover of
regulatory sRNAs in the model pathogen, Salmonella typhimurium, we have
constructed mutants for several ribonucleases (RNase E, RNase G, RNase III,
PNPase) and Poly(A) Polymerase I. The expression profiles of four sRNAs conserved
among many enterobacteria, CsrB, CsrC, MicA and SraL, were analysed and the
processing and stability of these sRNAs was studied in the constructed strains.
The degradosome was a common feature involved in the turnover of these four
sRNAs. PAPI-mediated polyadenylation was the major factor governing SraL
degradation. RNase III was revealed to strongly affect MicA decay. PNPase was
shown to be important in the decay of these four sRNAs. The stability of CsrB and
CsrC seemed to be independent of the RNA chaperone, Hfq, whereas the decay of
SraL and MicA was Hfq-dependent. Taken together, the results of this study
provide initial insight into the mechanisms of sRNA decay in Salmonella, and
indicate specific contributions of the RNA decay machinery components to the
turnover of individual sRNAs.
