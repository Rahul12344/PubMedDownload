BACKGROUND: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) amplifies
Toll-like receptor-initiated responses against pathogens. We aimed to
characterize TREM-1 expression and function during sepsis caused by Burkholderia 
pseudomallei (melioidosis).
METHODS: TREM-1 expression was determined on leukocytes and plasma from 34
patients with melioidosis and 32 controls and in mice with experimentally induced
melioidosis. Responsiveness toward B. pseudomallei of TREM-1(+) and TREM-1(-)
leukocytes was tested in vitro. TREM-1 function was inhibited in mice by a
synthetic peptide mimicking the ectodomain of this receptor.
RESULTS: Patients demonstrated increased soluble (s) TREM-1 plasma levels and
TREM-1 surface expression on monocytes but not granulocytes. Similarly, mice
inoculated with B. pseudomallei displayed a gradual rise in sTREM-1 level and an 
increase in blood monocyte but not granulocyte TREM-1 expression. At the primary 
infection site, however, granulocyte TREM-1 expression was enhanced, and the rise
in sTREM-1 level occurred earlier. Additionally, purified human TREM-1(-)
granulocytes showed reduced responsiveness to B. pseudomallei relative to
TREM-1(+)granulocytes, a difference not detected for TREM-1(-) and TREM-1(+)
monocytes. Treatment with a peptide mimicking a conserved domain of sTREM-1
partially protected mice from B. pseudomallei-induced lethality.
CONCLUSIONS: During melioidosis, TREM-1 expression is differentially regulated on
granulocytes and monocytes; measurement of TREM-1 expression on blood
granulocytes may not provide adequate information on granulocyte TREM-1
expression at the infection site. TREM-1 may be a therapeutic target in
melioidosis.
