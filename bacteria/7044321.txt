Pulmonary infection complicating intra-abdominal sepsis: clinical and
experimental observations.

Richardson JD, DeCamp MM, Garrison RN, Fry DE.

Pulmonary infection complicating intra-abdominal abscess is a major clinical
problem. One hundred and forty-three patients with abdominal abscesses were
reviewed; 41 had associated pneumonia by strictly defined criteria. The causative
organisms for the pneumonia were Pseudomonas (35), Klebsiella (20), and
Enterobacter (16), while abdominal infections were caused by Escherichia coli
(22), Klebsiella (21), and Enterococcus (18). The temporal and bacteriologic
relationship between the abdominal and pulmonary infection suggested that
decreased pulmonary host defenses might be operative in the high incidence of
pneumonia observed. An experimental model for intra-abdominal abscess was created
using cecal ligation in the rat. Animals with an abdominal abscess had a marked
depression of their ability to clear E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that were
injected into the airway. Macrophages from infected animals did not differ in
quantity or viability when compared with those in control animals. The ability to
ingest bacteria appeared to be normal or enhanced in infected animals, but there 
was a significant decrease in the ability of the macrophage to kill the ingested 
organisms. Such macrophage defects may be partially responsible for the infected 
animals' inability to clear bacteria in a normal manner.
