Ethyl acetate extracts of Armillaria tabescens (strain JNB-OZ344) showed
significant fungistatic and bacteristatic activities against several major human 
pathogens including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Escherichia coli
and Mycobacterium intracellulare. Chemical analysis of these extracts led to the 
isolation and identification of four new compounds, emestrin-F (1), emestrin-G
(2),
6-O-(4-O-methyl-Î²-D-glucopyranosyl)-8-hydroxy-2,7-dimethyl-4H-benzopyran-4-one
(3) and cephalosporolide-J (4), along with five other previously known compounds,
emestrin (5), cephalosporolide-E (6), decarestrictine-C2 (7), ergosterol and
brassicasterol. Structural elucidation of all compounds was carried out by NMR
and MS analyses. Antimicrobial assays revealed that compounds 1 and 5 were
responsible for the observed growth inhibitory activities of the fungal extracts 
against the human pathogens tested.
