Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria by apoptotic signals induces
ATP/dATP-dependent formation of the oligomeric Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptosome. Here 
we show that the documented anti-apoptotic effect of the principal heat-shock
protein, Hsp70, is mediated through its direct association with the
caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) of Apaf-1 and through inhibition of apoptosome 
formation. The interaction between Hsp70 and Apaf-1 prevents oligomerization of
Apaf-1 and association of Apaf-1 with procaspase-9. On the basis of these
results, we propose that resistance to apoptosis exhibited by stressed cells and 
some tumours, which constitutively express high levels of Hsp70, may be due in
part to modulation of Apaf-1 function by Hsp70.
