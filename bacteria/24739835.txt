Tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an
infectious disease that continues to be a significant health problem in a
developing country like India. The cause of peripheral neuropathy associated with
tuberculosis is controversial. Possibilities include the toxic effects of
anti-tuberculous chemotherapy (especially, rifampicin, streptomycin &
ethambutol), immune mediated neuropathy, direct invasion of nerves, vasculitic
neuropathy, compressive neuropathy, and meningitic reaction. This report
describes an unusual finding of tuberculous granulomas in the peripheral nerve
(Greater auricular nerve) of a patient ,who presented with a painful neck
swelling. Granulomas were present in Greater auricular nerve (C2,C3) biopsy
specimen associated with tuberculous peri-neuritis, but with no more specific
indications of the mechanism of the neuropathy.
