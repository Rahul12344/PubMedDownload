Mosquito engineering. Building a disease-fighting mosquito.

Enserink M.

With resistance against insecticides on the rise and a U.N.-backed push to phase 
out DDT, several labs have embarked on the most ambitious and futuristic of all
approaches to combat malaria: They hope to replace billions and billions of
mosquitoes in the world's endemic areas with new strains, created in the lab,
that would be "refractory," or unable to transmit Plasmodium, the parasite that
causes the disease. The idea is not that farfetched, these researchers claim.
