The impact of CD28 ligation upon CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation and
cytokine production was assessed. Although costimulation increased the
proliferative response of both T cell subsets, cytokine production was most
markedly increased in the CD4+ subset, as evidenced by a 40-fold increase in
interleukin-2 (IL-2), a 14-fold increase in interleukin-3 (IL-3) and 5-fold
increases in interferon gamma and GM-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) production. 
The CD8+ T cell response to CD28 ligation was less marked, maxima being a 5-fold 
increase in IL-2 production and 2-fold increases in IL-3 and GM-CSF production.
Resolution of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells into their CD44lo (na√Øve) and CD44hi
(memory/effector) subsets revealed that naive CD4+ T cells were the most
CD28-responsive subsets. CD28-mediated costimulation promotes distinct
differentiation programs in CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells.
