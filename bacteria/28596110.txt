BACKGROUND & AIM: Natural killer T (NKT) cells are CD1d-restricted innate-like T 
cells that modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Unlike the
well-characterized invariant/type I NKT cells, type II NKT cells with a diverse T
cell receptor repertoire are poorly understood. This study defines the pathogenic
role of type II NKT cells in the etiology of chronic liver inflammation.
METHODS: Transgenic mice with the Lck promoter directing CD1d overexpression on T
cells in Jα18 wild-type (Lck-CD1dTgJα18+; type I NKT cell sufficient) and
Jα18-deficient (Lck-CD1dTgJα18o, type I NKT cell deficient) mice were analyzed
for liver pathology and crosstalk between type II NKT cells and conventional T
cells. CD1d expression on T cells in peripheral blood samples and liver sections 
from autoimmune hepatitis patients and healthy individuals were also examined.
RESULTS: Lck-CD1dTgJα18o and Lck-CD1dTgJα18+ mice developed similar degrees of
liver pathology resembling chronic autoimmune hepatitis in humans. Increased CD1d
expression on T cells promoted the activation of type II NKT cells and other T
cells. This resulted in Th1-skewing and impaired Th2 cytokine production in type 
II NKT cells. Dysfunction of type II NKT cells was accompanied by conventional T 
cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to a hepatic
T/B lymphocyte infiltration, elevated autoantibodies and hepatic injury in
Lck-CD1dTg mice. A similar mechanism could be extended to humans as CD1d
expression is upregulated on activated human T cells and increased presence of
CD1d-expressing T cells was observed in autoimmune hepatitis patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveals enhanced crosstalk between type II NKT cells and
conventional T cells, leading to a Th1-skewed inflammatory milieu, and
consequently, to the development of chronic autoimmune liver disease. Lay
summary: CD1d overexpression on T cells enhances crosstalk between type II NKT
cells and T cells, resulting in their aberrant activation and leading to the
development of chronic autoimmune liver disease.
