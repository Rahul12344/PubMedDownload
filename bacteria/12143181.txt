[Origin and treatment of bad breath].

[Article in French]

Debaty B, Rompen E.

Halitosis affects more than 60% of the population. In about 8% of the cases,
halitosis is related to an ENT pathology, and in less than 1% to gastric
dysfunction. Ninety percent of these problems are associated to an oral disease. 
Gram-bacteria are often responsible of bad breath. They transform some
amino-acids in volatile sulphur compounds. These bacteria are, also, directly
associated with periodontal diseases which affect a major part of the adult
population. These diseases are the most important cause of tooth loss after the
age of thirty-five, with progressive destruction of supporting tissues of the
teeth.
