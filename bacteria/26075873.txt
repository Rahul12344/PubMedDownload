A thermostable esterase gene (hydS14) was cloned from an Actinomadura sp. S14
gene library. The gene is 777 bp in length and encodes a polypeptide of 258 amino
acid residues with no signal peptide, no N-glycosylation site and a predicted
molecular mass of 26,604 Da. The encoded protein contains the pentapeptide motif 
(GYSLG) and catalytic triad (Ser88-Asp208-His235) of the esterase/lipase
superfamily. The HydS14 sequence shows 46%-64% identity to 23 sequences from
actinomycetes (23 α/β-hydrolases), has three conserved regions, and contains the 
novel motif (GY(F)SLG), which distinguishes it from other clusters in the
α/β-hydrolase structural superfamily. A plasmid containing the coding region
(pPICZαA-hydS14) was used to express HydS14 in Pichia pastoris under the control 
of the AOXI promoter. The recombinant HydS14 collected from the supernatant had a
molecular mass of ~30 kDa, which agrees with its predicted molecular mass without
N-glycosylation. HydS14 had an optimum temperature of approximately 70 °C and an 
optimum pH of 8.0. HydS14 was stable at 50 and 60 °C for 120 min, with residual
activities of above 80% and above 90%, respectively, as well as 50% activity at
pH 6.0-8.0 and pH 9.0, respectively. The enzyme showed higher activity with
p-nitrophenyl-C2 and C4. The Km and Vmax values for p-nitrophenyl-C4 were 0.21 ± 
0.02 mM and 37.07 ± 1.04 μmol/min/mg, respectively. The enzyme was active toward 
short-chain p-nitrophenyl ester (C2-C6), displaying optimal activity with
p-nitrophenyl-C4 (Kcat/Km = 11.74 mM(-1) · S(-1)). In summary, HydS14 is a
thermostable esterase from Actinomadura sp. S14 that has been cloned and
expressed for the first time in Pichia pastoris.
