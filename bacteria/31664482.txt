The TAM receptors-TYRO3, AXL, MERTK-are pleiotropically expressed receptors in
both healthy and diseased tissue. A complex of the ligands Protein S (PROS1) or
Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) with apoptotic phosphatidylserine activates the
TAM receptors. Hence, this receptor family is essential for the efferocytosis of 
apoptotic material by antigen-presenting cells. In addition, TAM receptors are
expressed by virtually all cells of the tumor microenvironment. They are also
potent oncogenes, frequently overexpressed in cancer and involved in survival and
therapy resistance. Due to their pro-oncogenic and immune-inhibitory traits, TAM 
receptors have emerged as promising targets for cancer therapy. Recently, TAM
receptors have been described to function as costimulatory molecules on human T
cells. TAM receptors' ambivalent functions on many different cell types therefore
make therapeutic targeting not straight-forward. In this review we summarize our 
current knowledge of the function of TAM receptors in the tumor microenvironment.
We place particular focus on TAM receptors and the recently unraveled role of
MERTK in activated T cells and potential consequences for anti-tumor immunity.
