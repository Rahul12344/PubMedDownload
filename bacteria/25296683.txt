antimicrobial agent.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of the essential oil of Pimenta
pseudocaryophyllus in inhibiting the growth of the main bacteria responsible for 
bad perspiration odor (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus hauseri, Micrococcus
yunnanensis and Corynebacterium xerosis). The chemical profile of the essential
oil was evaluated by high-resolution gas chromatography (HR-GC) and four
constituents were identified, eugenol being the major component (88.6%). The
antimicrobial activity was evaluated by means of the turbidimetric method, using 
the microdilution assay. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the
essential oil ranged from 500 to 1,000 μg mL⁻¹. Scanning electron microscope
(SEM) observations confirmed the physical damage and morphological alteration of 
the test bacteria treated with the essential oil, reference drugs and eugenol.
The findings of the study demonstrated that this essential oil can be used in the
formulation of personal care products.
