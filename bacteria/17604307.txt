The optional Escherichia coli restriction tRNase PrrC represents a family of
potential antiviral devices widespread among bacteria. PrrC comprises a
functional C-domain of unknown structure and regulatory ABC/ATPase-like N-domain.
The possible involvement of a C-domain sequence in tRNA(Lys) recognition was
investigated using a matching end-protected 11-meric peptide. This mimic, termed 
here LARP (Lys-anticodon recognizing peptide) UV-cross-linked tRNA(Lys) anticodon
stem-loop (ASL) analogs and inhibited their PrrC-catalyzed cleavage. Trimming
LARP or introducing in it inactivating PrrC missense mutations impaired these
activities. LARP appeared to mimic its matching protein sequence in ability to
dimerize in parallel, as inferred from the following results. First, tethering
Cys to the amino- or carboxy-end of LARP dramatically enhanced the
ASL-cross-linking and PrrC-inhibiting activities under suitable redox conditions.
Second, Cys-substitutions in a C-domain region containing the sequence
corresponding to LARP elicited specific intersubunit cross-links. The parallel
dimerization of PrrC's C-domains and expected head-to-tail dimerization of its
N-domains further suggest that the NTPase and tRNA(Lys)-binding sites of PrrC
arise during distinct assembly stages of its dimer of dimers form.
