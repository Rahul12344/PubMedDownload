The findings in this article illustrate the complexity residing in the regulation
of reversible S-glutathionylation of proteins, such as GAPDH. This is clearly
reflected in the design of suitable experimental approaches designed to cope with
the interaction of several redox-dependent factors. Clear interactions are
demonstrated between oxidative modification of GAPDH and its subsequent
S-glutathionylation. Similarly, a redox interaction between GSSG and GAPDH with
Grx as the catalyst is shown, suggesting that the Grx molecule may participate in
catalytic S-glutathionylation in intact cells. Furthermore, Grx itself can
readily undergo S-glutathionylation, indicating the potential for regulation of
this catalyst of the reversible S-glutathionylation of other proteins. The
methodologies detailed in this work may provide a good reference point for other 
attempts to elucidate the mechanism of reversible S-glutathionylation of purified
proteins in a manner that more closely resembles the situation arising in intact 
cells during the generation of oxidative stress.
