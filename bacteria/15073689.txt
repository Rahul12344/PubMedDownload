Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is considered to improve host
defense during infection, via increased recruitment of and enhanced performance
of neutrophils and subsequent inhibition of potentially harmful proinflammatory
mediators. The present study sought to determine the role of endogenous G-CSF in 
host defense against pneumococcal pneumonia. Patients with unilateral
community-acquired pneumonia demonstrated elevated concentrations of G-CSF in
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the infected, but not from the
contralateral, site. Treatment of mice with pneumococcal pneumonia with an
anti-G-CSF antibody reduced neutrophil counts in lung tissue and diminished CD11b
expression on pulmonary neutrophils but increased the lung concentrations of
tumor necrosis factor- alpha, interleukin-1 beta, and cytokine-induced neutrophil
chemoattractant. Treatment with anti-G-CSF did not influence the outgrowth of
pneumococci in lungs, the dissemination of the infection, or survival in murine
pneumonia. During pneumococcal pneumonia, G-CSF is produced locally at the site
of the infection, where it exerts both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects.
