Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important regulatory
roles in gene expression, from histone modification to protein stability.
However, the functions of most identified lncRNAs are not known. In this study,
we investigated the role of an lncRNA called AW112010. The expression of AW112010
was significantly increased in CD4+ T cells from C57BL/6J mice activated in vivo 
with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B, or in
vitro with anti-CD3 anti-CD28 mAbs, thereby demonstrating that activation of T
cells leads to induction of AW112010. In contrast, anti-inflammatory cannabinoids
such as cannabidiol or δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol decreased the expression of
AW112010 in T cells. Interestingly, the expression of AW112010 was high in in
vitro-polarized Th1 and Th17 cells but low in Th2 cells, suggesting that this
lncRNA may regulate inflammation. To identify genes that might be regulated by
AW112010, we used chromatin isolation by RNA purification, followed by
sequencing. This approach demonstrated that AW112010 regulated the transcription 
of IL-10. Additionally, the level of IL-10 in activated T cells was low when the 
expression of AW112010 was increased. Use of small interfering RNA to knock down 
AW112010 expression in activated T cells led to increased IL-10 expression and a 
decrease in the expression of IFN-γ. Further studies showed that AW112010
interacted with histone demethylase KDM5A, which led to decreased H3K4
methylation in IL-10 gene locus. Together, these studies demonstrate that lncRNA 
AW112010 promotes the differentiation of inflammatory T cells by suppressing
IL-10 expression through histone demethylation.
