Both CD28 and its relative, inducible costimulator (ICOS), have a binding motif
for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) in their cytoplasmic tail, and the
binding of PI3K leads to activation of a serine/threonine kinase, Akt. The role
of Akt in cytokine production and helper T (Th) cell differentiation remains
obscure. In this study, we found that enforced expression of the constitutively
active form (E40K) of Akt rendered CD4(+) T cells activated. Wild-type of Akt and
E40K promoted Th1 cell differentiation in C57BL/6-derived and Th1-polarized
BALB/c-derived CD4(+) T cells, while both promoted Th2 cell differentiation in
BALB/c-derived and Th2-polarized C57BL/6 CD4(+) T cells. E40K also facilitated
Th1 differentiation in CD4(+) T cells from IL-4-deficient mice with the BALB/c
background. E40K up-regulated expression of NF-AT and c-Myb, which may be related
to the augmentation of cytokine production by E40K. These findings indicate that 
the mechanism by which Akt augments cytokine production via CD28 and ICOS is Th
cell type-specific and reflects the intracellular status affected by the cytokine
milieu. We conclude that Akt is a neutral amplifier of T cell activation and Th
differentiation.
