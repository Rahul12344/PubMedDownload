Major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted CD8(+) cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL) are implicated in protective Th1 immunity to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection. We report the identification of three novel
HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes within mycobacterial superoxide dismutase
(SodA), L-alanine dehydrogenase (AlaDH), and L-glutamine synthetase (GlnS)
proteins.
