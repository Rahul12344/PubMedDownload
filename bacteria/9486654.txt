Non-liganded retinoic acid receptors (RARs) repress transcription of target genes
by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex through a class of silencing
mediators termed SMRT or N-CoR. Mutant forms of RARalpha, created by chromosomal 
translocations with either the PML (for promyelocytic leukaemia) or the PLZF (for
promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger) locus, are oncogenic and result in human
acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). PML-RARalpha APL patients achieve complete
remission following treatments with pharmacological doses of retinoic acids (RA);
in contrast, PLZF-RARalpha patients respond very poorly, if at all. Here we
report that the association of these two chimaeric receptors with the histone
deacetylase (HDAC) complex helps to determine both the development of APL and the
ability of patients to respond to retinoids. Consistent with these observations, 
inhibitors of histone deacetylase dramatically potentiate retinoid-induced
differentiation of RA-sensitive, and restore retinoid responses of RA-resistant, 
APL cell lines. Our findings suggest that oncogenic RARs mediate leukaemogenesis 
through aberrant chromatin acetylation, and that pharmacological manipulation of 
nuclear receptor co-factors may be a useful approach in the treatment of human
disease.
