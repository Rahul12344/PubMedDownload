Isolation and properties of complement-resistant strains of Escherichia coli
K-12.

Akiyama Y, Inoue K.

Several strains that were resistant to the bactericidal action of antibody and
complement were isolated from Escherichia coli K-12 W3110/SM by selecting them
through the medium containing antiserum and complement. They can be agglutinated 
by antiserum against the parent strain and showed similar immune adherence
reactivity to the parent when sensitized with this antiserum. Few differences
were found in the compositions of phospholipids and proteins between both inner
and outer membranes of these strains and those of the parent. However, there were
fewer short-chain and more long-chain fatty acids in these strains than in the
parent. It was also found that unsaturated fatty acide decreased and saturated
and cyclopropanoic acids increased in phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylglycerol in both inner and outer membranes of one of these strains
when compared with those from the parent. Therefore, the resistance of these
strains to the complement-mediated bactericidal action was considered to be due
to the rigidity of their membrane structures which might repel the insertion of
membrane-attack complement complex C5b-9, although they could fix the earlier
complement components up to the step of the formation of C4b,2a,3b complex
enzyme.
