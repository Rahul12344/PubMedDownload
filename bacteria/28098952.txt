Ripostatin is a promising antibiotic that inhibits RNA polymerase by binding to a
novel binding site. In this study, the characterization of the biosynthetic gene 
cluster of ripostatin, which is a peculiar polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid
cluster encoding cis- and trans-acyltransferase PKS genes, is reported. Moreover,
an unprecedented mechanism for phenyl acetic acid formation and loading as a
starter unit was discovered. This phenyl-C2 unit is derived from phenylpyruvate
(phenyl-C3) and the mechanism described herein explains the mysterious loss of
one carbon atom in ripostatin biosynthesis from the phenyl-C3 precursor. Through 
in vitro reconstitution of the whole loading process, a pyruvate dehydrogenase
like protein complex was revealed that performs thiamine pyrophosphate dependent 
decarboxylation of phenylpyruvate to form a phenylacetyl-S-acyl carrier protein
species, which is supplied to the subsequent biosynthetic assembly line for chain
extension to finally yield ripostatin.
