Aim: Infectious coryza is caused by Avibacterium paragallinarum. In Indonesia,
this infection results in a 10%-40% decrease in egg production by laying hens.
This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of tetravalent coryza
vaccine contained A. paragallinarum bacterin serovars A, B, C2, and C3; strain
A-221, B-Spross, C2-Modesto, and C-3-Akko in layers based on antibody titer and
clinical signs using a post-challenge test.
Materials and Methods: Forty four-week-old Lohmanns strain chickens were used in 
this study. Forty chickens were divided into four groups for serological and
challenge test: Group 1 (unvaccinated and challenged by A. paragallinarum serovar
A), Group 2 (unvaccinated and challenged by A. paragallinarum serovar B), Group 3
(vaccinated and challenged by A. paragallinarum serovar A), and Group 4
(vaccinated and challenged by A. paragallinarum serovar B). Vaccination was done 
using the tetravalent vaccine in oil-emulsion adjuvant contained A.
paragallinarum bacterin serovars A, B, C2, and C3; strain A-221, B-Spross,
C2-Modesto, and C-3-Akko. Vaccination was performed at day 1 and booster was done
at day 14. Blood serum was collected on days 0, 14, and 28 for the
hemagglutination-hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. The challenge test was
given at day 29 through intranasal administration using A. paragallinarum
serovars A-L2447 and B-L1710 approximately 6Ã—108 CFU/mL. Clinical signs were
observed for 14 days post-infection. At the end of the study, chickens were
euthanized, and pathological features of the infraorbital sinus, facial skin, and
trachea were recorded.
Results: Data analysis of antibody titers and pathological changes was performed 
descriptively, while clinical symptom scores were analyzed non-parametrically
with the Mann-Whitney U-test using SPSS version 21. At days 14 and 28
post-vaccination, the antibody titer in Group 3 was 5 HI and 20 HI, respectively.
However, the antibody titers in Group 4 at 28 days post-vaccination were 0 HI.
Clinical observations, the vaccinated groups that were challenged with A.
paragallinarum serovars A and B showed clinical symptoms on days 4 and 6
post-infection, namely mild unilateral facial edema and severe bilateral facial
edema, respectively. Clinical signs in Groups 3 and 4 were less severe than in
Groups 1 and 2 (p<0.05). Pathological examination findings supported clinical
observations and serological testing.
Conclusion: Tetravalent coryza vaccine in chickens has efficacy to protect
against the challenge test of A. paragallinarum serovars A and B isolated from
Indonesia.
