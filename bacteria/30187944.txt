Autologous CD19 chimeric-antigen receptor (CAR) T cells demonstrated remarkable
remission rates in relapsed and refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R
ALL). Here, we report results from a phase 1b/2 study of in-house produced CD19
CAR with a CD28 costimulatory domain. Twenty-one patients with R/R ALL were
enrolled, and 20 infused. The median age was 11 years (range, 5-48). Patients had
a median of 4 prior regimens, including blinatumomab in 6 and prior stem-cell
transplantation in 10. In total 8 patients had extramedullary (EM) leukemic
involvement, and prior to lymphodepletion and CAR 7 had active lesions, a group
underrepresented in previous trials. In vivo expansion of CAR T cells was
observed in 18 patients. In total 16 patients developed cytokine release
syndrome, and 11 patients developed neurotoxicity, with no toxic deaths. All
responding patients were referred to an allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell
transplantation. The remission rate was 90%, including resolution of all
refractory EM sites. Four responding patients relapsed, 3 who had a PCR-MRD
positive remission at 28 days following CAR-T cells and 1 patient 21 months after
an MRD-negative response. The estimated 1-year event-free survival and overall
survival are 73% and 90%, respectively. Patients with R/R EM ALL may also benefit
from CAR-T cell therapy.
