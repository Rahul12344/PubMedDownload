The vast majority of new human HLA class I alleles are formed by conversions
between existing alleles of the same locus. A notable exception to this rule is
HLA-B*4601 formed by replacement of residues 66-76 of the alpha 1 helix of B*1501
by the homologous segment of Cw*0102. This inter-locus recombination, which
brings together characteristic elements of HLA-B and HLA-C structure, is shown
here to influence function dramatically. Naturally processed peptides bound by
B*4601 are distinct from those of its parental allotypes B*1501 and Cw*0102 and
dominated by three high abundance peptides. Such increased peptide selectivity by
B*4601 is unique among HLA-A,B,C allotypes. For other aspects of function,
presence of the small segment of HLA-C-derived sequence in an otherwise HLA-B
framework converts B*4601 to an HLA-C-like molecule. Alloreactive cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTL), natural killer (NK) cells, and cellular glycosidases all
recognize B*4601 as though it were an HLA-C allotype. These unusual properties
are those of an allotype which has frequencies as high as 20% in south east Asian
populations and is associated with predisposition to autoimmune diseases and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
