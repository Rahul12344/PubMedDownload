Recent systematic genome searches revealed that bacteria encode a tremendous
number of small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs). Whereas most of these molecules remain
of unknown function, it has become increasingly clear that many of them will act 
to modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Where studied in
more detail, sRNAs have often been found to control the expression of outer
membrane proteins (OMPs). Enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella 
are now known to encode at least eight OMP-regulating sRNAs (InvR, MicA, MicC,
MicF, OmrAB, RseX and RybB). These sRNAs exert their functions under a variety of
growth and stress conditions, including the sigmaE-mediated envelope stress
response. An sRNA-OMP network is emerging in which some sRNAs act specifically on
a single omp mRNA, whereas others control multiple omp mRNA targets.
