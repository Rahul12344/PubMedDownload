Mucins are heavily O-glycosylated proteins primarily produced by glandular and
ductal epithelial cells, either in membrane-tethered or secretory forms, for
providing lubrication and protection from various exogenous and endogenous
insults. However, recent studies have linked their aberrant overexpression with
infection, inflammation, and cancer that underscores their importance in tissue
homeostasis. In this review, we present current status of the existing mouse
models that have been developed to gain insights into the functional role(s) of
mucins under physiological and pathological conditions. Knockout mouse models for
membrane-associated (Muc1 and Muc16) and secretory mucins (Muc2) have helped us
to elucidate the role of mucins in providing effective and protective barrier
functions against pathological threats, participation in disease progression, and
improved our understanding of mucin interaction with biotic and abiotic
environmental components. Emphasis is also given to available transgenic mouse
models (MUC1 and MUC7), which has been exploited to understand the
context-dependent regulation and therapeutic potential of human mucins during
inflammation and cancer.
