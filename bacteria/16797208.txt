Mycobacterium kansasii is an emerging pathogen that is able to induce pulmonary
disease resembling tuberculosis. To determine the role of interleukin (IL-)1 in
lung infection caused by this atypical mycobacterium, IL-1 receptor type 1
knockout (IL-1R(1) KO) and normal wild type mice were intranasally infected with 
M. kansasii. IL-1R(1) KO mice demonstrated a reduced antibacterial response in
the lungs and an increased dissemination to the liver, which was accompanied by
an enhanced pulmonary inflammatory response. These data identify IL-1 as an
important component of the innate immune response to lung infection by M.
kansasii.
