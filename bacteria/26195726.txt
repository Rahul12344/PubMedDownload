Physiological bone remodeling requires that bone formation by osteoblasts be
tightly coupled to bone resorption by osteoclasts. However, relatively little is 
understood about how this coupling is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that
modulation of NF-κB signaling in osteoclasts via a novel activity of charged
multivesicular body protein 5 (CHMP5) is a key determinant of systemic rates of
bone turnover. A conditional deletion of CHMP5 in osteoclasts leads to increased 
bone resorption by osteoclasts coupled with exuberant bone formation by
osteoblasts, resembling an early onset, polyostotic form of human Paget's disease
of bone (PDB). These phenotypes are reversed by haploinsufficiency for Rank, as
well as by antiresorptive treatments, including alendronate, zolendronate, and
OPG-Fc. Accordingly, CHMP5-deficient osteoclasts display increased RANKL-induced 
NF-κB activation and osteoclast differentiation. Biochemical analysis
demonstrated that CHMP5 cooperates with the PDB genetic risk factor
valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) to stabilize the inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα),
down-regulating ubiquitination of IκBα via the deubiquitinating enzyme USP15.
Thus, CHMP5 tunes NF-κB signaling downstream of RANK in osteoclasts to dampen
osteoclast differentiation, osteoblast coupling and bone turnover rates, and
disruption of CHMP5 activity results in a PDB-like skeletal disorder.
