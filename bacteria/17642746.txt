Two hundred and thirty-six women with previous bad obstetric history (BOH),
belonging to different socio-economic groups were investigated for the presence
of Toxoplasma specific antibodies (IgG/IgM) using commercial diagnostic kits. The
study showed a higher percentage of IgG seropositivity in women of low
socioeconomic group (LSG) compared to those of high socioeconomic group (HSG).
Specific IgM positivity indicative of possible acute infection, was higher in
women of HSG, emphasizing the need for educating pregnant mothers on preventive
measures. However, there is a need to undertake in-depth studies to understand
the significance of the presence of IgM in women with BOH.
