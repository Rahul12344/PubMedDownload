Purpose: Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are powerful tools to expand
antigen-specific T cells ex vivo and in vivo for tumor immunotherapy, but suffer 
from time-consuming generation and biosafety concerns raised by live cells.
Alternatively, the cell-free artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) have
been rapidly developed. Nanoscale aAPCs are recently proposed owing to their
superior biodistribution and reduced embolism than conventional cell-sized aAPCs,
but pose the challenges: easier cellular uptake and smaller contact surface area 
with T cells than the cell-sized counterparts. This study aimed to fabricate a
new "stealth" nano-aAPCs with microscale contact surface area to minimize
cellular uptake and activate antigen-specific T cells by combination uses of
ellipsoidal stretch, PEGylation, and self-marker CD47-Fc conjugation.
Methods: The spherical polylactic-co-glycolic acid nanoparticles were fabricated 
using a double-emulsion method, and then stretched twofold using film-stretching 
procedure followed by PEGylation and co-coupling with CD47-Fc,
H-2Kb/TRP2180-188-Ig dimers, and anti-CD28. The resulting PEGylated and
CD47-conjugated nanoellipsoidal aAPCs (EaAPCPEG/CD47) were co-cultured with
macrophages or spleen lymphocytes and also infused into melanoma-bearing mice.
The in vitro and in vivo effects were evaluated and compared with the
nanospherical aAPCs (SaAPC), nanoellipsoidal aAPCs (EaAPC), or PEGylated
nanoellipsoidal aAPC (EaAPCPEG).
Results: EaAPCPEG/CD47 markedly reduced cellular uptake in vitro and in vivo, as 
compared with EaAPCPEG, EaAPC, SaAPC, and Blank-NPs and expanded na√Øve
TRP2180-188-specific CD8+ T cells in the co-cultures with spleen lymphocytes.
After three infusions, the EaAPCPEG/CD47 showed much stronger effects on
facilitating TRP2180-188-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation, local infiltration, 
and tumor necrosis in the melanoma-bearing mice and on inhibiting tumor growth
than the control aAPCs.
Conclusion: The superimposed or synergistic effects of ellipsoidal stretch,
PEGylation, and CD47-Fc conjugation minimized cellular uptake of nano-aAPCs and
enhanced their functionality to expand antigen-specific T cells and inhibit tumor
growth, thus suggesting a more valuable strategy to design "stealth" nanoscale
aAPCs suitable for tumor active immunotherapy.
