In most vertebrates, the upper digestive tract is composed of muscularized jaws
linked to the esophagus that permits food ingestion and swallowing. Masticatory
and esophagus striated muscles (ESM) share a common cardiopharyngeal mesoderm
(CPM) origin, however ESM are unusual among striated muscles as they are
established in the absence of a primary skeletal muscle scaffold. Using mouse
chimeras, we show that the transcription factors Tbx1 and Isl1 are required
cell-autonomously for myogenic specification of ESM progenitors. Further, genetic
loss-of-function and pharmacological studies point to MET/HGF signaling for
antero-posterior migration of esophagus muscle progenitors, where Hgf ligand is
expressed in adjacent smooth muscle cells. These observations highlight the
functional relevance of a smooth and striated muscle progenitor dialogue for ESM 
patterning. Our findings establish a Tbx1-Isl1-Met genetic hierarchy that
uniquely regulates esophagus myogenesis and identify distinct genetic signatures 
that can be used as framework to interpret pathologies arising within CPM
derivatives.
