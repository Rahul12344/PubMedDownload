OBJECTIVE; To clone the fimA gene of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and
detect its expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli).METHODS: The fimA gene was
obtained by PCR from the genome of P. gingivalis to construct a prokaryotic
expression plasmid pT-BAD/fimA. pT-BAD/fimA was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3) competent cells and the recombination protein was characterized by means of
matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(MALDI-TOF-MS) analysis. The bound protein was eluted with different
concentrations of imidazole (250, 200, 150, 100, 50 micromol x L(-1))
respectively.
RESULTS: DNA sequencing showed that the fragment was 99.9% consistent with that
of the published. After induction with L-arabinose, a new 3.8 x 10(4) protein
appeared on SDS-PAGE gel. The protein was further identified by MALDI-TOF-MS.
Purity of 95% of the target protein was purified by Ni-NTA Purification System
after eluted with 100 micromol x L(-1) imidazole.
CONCLUSION: The fimA gene of P. gingivalis was cloned successfully and its
protein was expressed correctly in E. coli. A high purity of protein FimA was
obtained and it could be applied for follow-up researches.
