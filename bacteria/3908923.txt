Effect of induction by DDT on metabolism and mutagenicity of benzo[a]pyrene.

Bonin AM, Stupans I, Baker RS, Ryan AJ, Holder GM.

Liver microsomal enzymes are essential for the detection of benzo[a]pyrene
(B[a]P)-mediated mutagenesis in the Salmonella/mammalian microsome mutagenicity
test and, furthermore, this mutagenicity is considerably enhanced by induction of
hepatic enzymes involved with drug metabolism. Although Aroclor 1254 is most
commonly used for induction of S9 enzymes, DDT is also capable of this induction.
This paper reports a comparison of liver S9 fraction induced by the two agents:
there is a marked difference in their concentration optima for metabolism of
B[a]P; greater numbers of revertant colonies are seen with Aroclor-induced S9,
which is optimal at a concentration of 10% (v/v), whereas DDT-induced S9 is
optimal at 2.5% (v/v); Aroclor induces aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH),
cytochrome P-450 and epoxide hydrase while DDT induces only AHH, to about half
the level detected in the Aroclor-induced S9 fraction. A comparison of metabolite
distribution for Aroclor- and DDT-induced hepatic microsomes reveals quantitative
differences only. DDT-induced microsomes yield a greater proportion of
B[a]P-4,5-oxide and its metabolic product B[a]P-4,5-dihydrodiol than do
Aroclor-induced microsomes. Time course studies on the mutagen half-life measured
on the agar plate provides good evidence that metabolites responsible for
mutagenicity were different for each inducer.
