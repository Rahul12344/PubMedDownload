Amebiasis, caused by intestinal infection with Entamoeba histolytica, is one of
the leading causes of parasite infection-related mortality and morbidity
globally. Although its pathogenesis, including determinant factors of infection
outcome, remains unclear, recent clinical data indicate that the gut microbiome
plays a role in determining the severity of amebiasis. Recently, we investigated 
the effects of the gut microbiome on neutrophil mediated protection from E.
histolytica infection using a mouse model. We identified that surface expression 
of CXCR2 on neutrophils was diminished in mice with dysbiosis, which resulted in 
decreased neutrophil recruitment to the infection site, allowing more aggressive 
intestinal tissue damage by E. histolytica. Our results indicated that oxidase
activity during E. histolytica infection was also diminished after dysbiosis,
consistent with the results from prior research. Thus, the gut microbiome plays
an important role in regulating neutrophil phenotype when fighting against
external pathogens.
