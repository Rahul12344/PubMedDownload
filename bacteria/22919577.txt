There are many pathogenic Clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that
include protein toxins. Some of these bacteria, such as C. botulinum, C.
difficile, C. perfringens, and C. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals
as well as humans. These often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary 
protein toxins that follow a classic AB paradigm. Within a targeted cell, all
clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-ADP-ribosylation of 
globular actin by the A component. However, much less is known about B component 
binding to cell-surface receptors. These toxins share sequence homology amongst
themselves and with those produced by another Gram-positive, spore-forming
bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: Bacillus anthracis.
This review focuses upon the iota and C2 families of clostridial binary toxins
and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3)
sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following
toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. In summary, these protein toxins
aid diverse enteric species within the genus Clostridium.
