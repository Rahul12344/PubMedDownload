Affinity alkylation of 3-oxo-delta 5-steroid isomerase by steroidal 3
beta-oxiranes: identification of the modified amino acid by reduction with
hydroxyborohydride.

Bounds PL, Pollack RM.

The steroidal 3 beta-oxirane (3S)-spiro[5 alpha-androstane-3,2'-oxiran]-17
beta-ol (1 beta) is an active site directed irreversible inhibitor of the
3-oxo-delta 5-steroid isomerase from Pseudomonas testosteroni. Two steroid-bound 
peptides (TPS1 and TPS2) were isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) from the trypsin digest of enzyme inactivated with 1 beta. The modified
tryptic peptides (residues 14-45 of the enzyme) were further digested with
chymotrypsin, each giving rise to a single steroid-containing product (CPS1 and
CPS2, respectively) derived from residues 31 to 45 of the enzyme. The modified
chymotryptic peptides were isolated by HPLC, and the peptide-steroid ester
linkage was reduced with sodium hydroxyborohydride. Amino acid analysis of the
reduced peptides gave ca. 0.5 residue of homoserine and one less residue of
aspartic acid than the corresponding unreduced peptides. Sequence analysis of
both reduced chymotryptic peptides revealed that homoserine was located at
position 8 in the peptide sequence, corresponding to residue 38 of the enzyme.
The finding that the steroidal 3 beta-oxirane, like the 17 beta-oxiranes,
inactivates the isomerase via esterification of aspartic acid-38 is strong
evidence that this enzyme binds steroids in at least two orientations.
