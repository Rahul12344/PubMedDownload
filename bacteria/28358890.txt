The main limitation of tissue engineering lies in the inability to stimulate
osteogenesis, angiogenesis of stem cells and broad-spectrum antimicrobial
activity. However, the development of multifunctional bioactive materials with
these capabilities remains a great challenge. In this study, we prepared
mesoporous silica nanoparticles encapsulated with silver nanocrystals (AG-MSN)
with uniform sphere size and mesopores. Platelet-derived growth factor BB
(PDGF-BB) was effectively loaded in the AG-MSN mesopores (P-AG-MSN). The silicon 
ions (Si) released by P-AG-MSN stimulate osteogenic differentiation of bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSC) by activating the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
of bone-related genes and increasing protein (OCN, RUNX2 and OPN) expression. Ag+
ions could be slowly released from the interior of the shell, highlighting their 
durable antibacterial activity. The sustained release of PDGF-BB from P-AG-MSN
stimulated the angiogenic differentiation of BMSC, as indicated by the enhanced
secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), HIF-1Î±, HGF and ANG-1 and
protein expression. Our results show that P-AG-MSN can clearly promote BMSC
osteostimulation and vascularization. This research serves as a preliminary study
of the utilization of this multifunctional mixture to fabricate a new active
biological scaffold that integrates BMSC osteostimulation, vascularization and
bactericidal effects by 3D printing technology.
