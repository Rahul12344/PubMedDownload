INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes
chronic inflammation of the joints. Recent evidence indicated the epigenetic
changes may contribute to the pathogenesis of RA.
METHOD: To understand the extent and nature of dysregulated DNA methylation in RA
CD4T cells, we performed a genome-wide DNA methylation study in CD4 + T cells in 
12 RA patients compared to 12 matched normal healthy controls. Cytosine
methylation status was quantified with Illumina methylation 450K microarray.
RESULT: The DNA methylation profiling showed 383 hyper- and 785 hypo-methylated
genes in the CD4 + T cells of the RA patients (p < 3.4 × 10-7). Gene ontology
analysis indicated transcript alternative splicing and protein modification
mediated by DNA methylation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of
RA. In addition, the result showed that human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region
including HLA-DRB6, HLA-DQA1 and HLA-E was frequently hypomethylated, but
HLA-DQB1 hypermethylated in CpG island region and hypomethylated in CpG shelf
region in RA patients. Outside the MHC region, HDAC4, NXN, TBCD and TMEM61 were
the most hypermethylated genes, while ITIH3, TCN2, PRDM16, SLC1A5 and GALNT9 are 
the most hypomethylated genes.
CONCLUSION: Genome-wide DNA methylation profile revealed significant DNA
methylation change in CD4 + T cells from patients with RA.
