INTRODUCTION: Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is an antimicrobial peptide, induced 
by bacterial stimuli and inflammation, that plays a role in mucosal and skin
innate immune defense. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor
family is important in innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and
proinflammatory cytokines. NF-kappaB operates via the traditional IKKbeta
signaling, as well as an alternative pathway utilizing IKKalpha signaling, which 
is important in keratinocyte differentiation. Our previous studies showed that
pathogenic, but not commensal, bacteria used NF-kappaB signaling in hBD-2
induction. The objective of this study was to understand which arm of the
NF-kappaB pathway is involved in gingival epithelial cell responses to pathogenic
bacteria, including hBD-2 induction.
METHODS: Cultured oral epithelial cells were transfected with synthetic small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for various steps in each pathway, namely
IKKbeta, TRAF6 and MyD88 in the canonical, and IKKalpha and TRAF3 in the
alternative pathway, and subsequently stimulated with various oral bacteria.
RESULTS: The hBD-2 induction level was reduced to 21-61% in cells in which the
alternative NF-kappaB pathway was blocked and subsequently stimulated with
pathogenic bacteria, while cells in which the canonical pathway was blocked
showed reduction to 78-99%. Cells stimulated with commensals showed little change
in hBD-2 induction level regardless of the siRNA used. Microarray analysis showed
that oral epithelia differentially regulated numerous innate immune markers in
response to pathogens and commensals.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a role for the IKKalpha/TRAF3 pathway in NF-kappaB
activation by pathogenic bacteria, while commensal bacteria do not utilize either
NF-kappaB pathway, for hBD-2 induction.
