MHC class II deficiency is a severe primary immunodeficiency characterized by the
absence of Major Histocompatibility Complex class II gene expression. It is
genetically heterogenous and can result from defects in several different
transacting regulatory factors required for transcription of MHC class II genes. 
Cell lines from MHC class II deficiency patients have been assigned to three
complementation groups (A, B, C). An in vitro generated cell line (6.1.6) was
reported to be the sole representative of a fourth group (group D). The molecular
defect in 6.1.6 resides in the recently cloned RFXAP gene. Direct complementation
experiments and mutation analysis were performed with cell lines from several MHC
class II deficiency patients in which the affected gene had not been identified. 
These experiments have allowed us to define a previously unrecognized MHC class
II deficiency complementation group containing patients having mutations in the
RFXAP gene.
