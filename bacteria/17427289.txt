The bacterial envelope stress response (ESR) is triggered by the accumulation of 
misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs) upon envelope damage or excessive OMP
synthesis, and is mediated by the alternative sigma factor, sigmaE. Activation of
the GE pathway causes a rapid downregulation of major omp mRNAs, which prevents
further build-up of unassembled OMPs and liberates the translocation and folding 
apparatus under conditions that require envelope remodelling. The factors that
facilitate the rapid removal of the unusually stable omp mRNAs in the ESR were
previously unknown. We report that in Salmonella the ESR relies upon two highly
conserved, sigmaE-controlled small non-coding RNAs, RybB and MicA. By using a
transcriptomic approach and kinetic analyses of target mRNA decay in vivo, RybB
was identified as the factor that selectively accelerates the decay of multiple
major omp mRNAs upon induction of the ESR, while MicA is proposed to facilitate
rapid decay of the single ompA mRNA. In unstressed bacterial cells, the two
oE-dependent small RNAs function within a surveillance loop to maintain envelope 
homeostasis and to achieve autoregulation of oE.
