Peptidase family S46 consists of two types of dipeptidyl-peptidases (DPPs), DPP7 
and DPP11, which liberate dipeptides from the N-termini of polypeptides along
with the penultimate hydrophobic and acidic residues, respectively. Their
specificities are primarily defined by a single amino acid residue, Gly673 in
DPP7 and Arg673 in DPP11 (numbering for Porphyromonas gingivalis DPP11).
Bacterial species in the phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes generally possess
one gene for each, while Bacteroides species exceptionally possess three genes,
one gene as DPP7 and two genes as DPP11, annotated based on the full-length
similarities. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the above-mentioned 
Bacteroides S46 DPPs. A recombinant protein of the putative DPP11 gene
BF9343_2924 from Bacteroides fragilis harboring Gly673 exhibited DPP7 activity by
hydrolyzing Leu-Leu-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA). Another gene, BF9343_2925, as
well as the Bacteroides vulgatus gene (BVU_2252) with Arg673 was confirmed to
encode DPP11. These results demonstrated that classification of S46 peptidase is 
enforceable by the S1 essential residues. Bacteroides DPP11 showed a decreased
level of activity towards the substrates, especially with P1-position Glu.
Findings of 3D structural modeling indicated three potential amino acid
substitutions responsible for the reduction, one of which, Asn650Thr
substitution, actually recovered the hydrolyzing activity of Leu-Glu-MCA. On the 
other hand, the gene currently annotated as DPP7 carrying Gly673 from B. fragilis
(BF9343_0130) and Bacteroides ovatus (Bovatus_03382) did not hydrolyze any of the
examined substrates. The existence of a phylogenic branch of these putative
Bacteroides DPP7 genes classified by the C-terminal conserved region
(Ser571-Leu700) strongly suggests that Bacteroides species expresses a DPP with
an unknown property. In conclusion, the genus Bacteroides exceptionally expresses
three S46-family members; authentic DPP7, a new subtype of DPP11 with
substantially reduced specificity for Glu, and a third group of S46 family
members.
