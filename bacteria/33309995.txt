Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and protein aggresome formation is considered to be a hallmark event for 
the disease. Since dysfunction of lysosome-mediated protein degradation leads to 
enhanced accumulation of misfolded proteins and subsequent aggresome formation,
we examined the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on ESCRT-mediated sorting
in S. cerevisiae as this process is necessary for the functioning of the vacuole,
the lysosomal equivalent in yeast. An operational ESCRT pathway is essential for 
ion homeostasis and our observation that exposure to CSE caused increased
sensitivity to LiCl indicated CSE-induced impairment of ESCRT function. To
confirm the inhibition of ESCRT function, the targeting of carboxypeptidase S
(CPS), which reaches the vacuole lumen via the ESCRT pathway, was examined.
Treatment with CSE resulted in the mislocalization of GFP-tagged CPS to the
vacuolar membrane, instead of the vacuolar lumen, confirming defective
functioning of the ESCRT machinery in CSE-treated cells. Further analysis
revealed that CSE-treatment inhibited the recruitment of the ESCRT-0 component,
Vps27, to the endosome surface, which is a key event is for the functioning of
the ESCRT pathway. This lack of endosomal recruitment of Vps27 most likely
results from a depletion of the endosomally-enriched lipid, phosphatidylinositol 
3-phosphate (PI3-P), which is the target of Vps27. This is supported by our
observation that the presence of excess leucine, a known activator of the lipid
kinase responsible for the generation of PI3-P, Vps34, in the medium can rescue
the CSE-induced ESCRT misfunctioning. Thus, the current study provides an insight
into CSE-induced aggresome formation as it documents that CSE treatment
compromises vacuolar degradation due to an impairment of the ESCRT pathway, which
likely stems from the inhibition of Vps34. It also indicates that leucine has the
potential to attenuate the CSE-induced accumulation of misfolded proteins.
