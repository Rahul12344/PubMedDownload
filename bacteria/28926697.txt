Disturbed metabolism of copper ions can cause diseases such as Wilson's disease
(WD). In this work, we investigated the inhibitory effect of Cu(II) ion in vitro 
on the AlkB family DNA repair enzymes, which are members of the
Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase and include human ALKBH2,
ALKBH3, and E. coli AlkB proteins. None of the three proteins was significantly
inhibited under normal cellular copper concentrations. However, under WD related 
condition, we observed that the activities of all three enzymes were strongly
suppressed (from 95.2 to 100.0%). We also noted the repair efficiency under
ds-DNA condition was less susceptible than ss-DNA to the inhibition.
