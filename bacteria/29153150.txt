Interest in addressing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has grown recently but
little effort has been made to consider how existing and new vaccines could
impact on AMR. A 2017 Chatham House meeting considered the role of vaccines and
how to demonstrate their value through their impact on AMR. Ways existing
vaccines have reduced antibiotic prescribing and the prevalence of some resistant
organisms were reviewed. Other new vaccines could have a similar impact. In
gonorrhoea, where complete resistance has developed, vaccine may be the best
option. Valuing the impact of vaccines on AMR was challenging: there were
difficult methodological issues and a lack of data for modelling. A participant
poll suggested priorities for accelerated vaccine development were tuberculosis, 
typhoid, influenza, RSV and gonorrhoea. More evidence is needed to convince
policymakers but that vaccine development projects should be considered by
funders on the same basis as those for new antibiotics or diagnostics.
