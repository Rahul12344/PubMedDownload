Microbial utilization of estuarine dissolved organic carbon: a stable isotope
tracer approach tested by mass balance.

Hullar M, Fry B, Peterson BJ, Wright RT.

The natural stable isotope values of different plants have been used to trace the
fate of organic carbon that enters estuarine ecosystems. Experiments were
designed to determine the magnitude of (delta) (sup13)C changes of dissolved
organic carbon (DOC) derived from tidal marsh vegetation that occurred during
bacterial decomposition. Bacteria were grown on DOC leached from estuarine
Spartina alterniflora and Typhus angustifolia plants. In four experiments, 25 to 
80% of the initial carbon (2.6 to 9.1 mM organic C) was converted to bacterial
biomass and CO(inf2). Mass balance calculations showed good recovery of total C
and (sup13)C at the end of these experiments (100% (plusmn) 14% total C; (plusmn)
1(permil) (delta) (sup13)C). The (delta) (sup13)C values of DOC, bacterial
biomass, and respired CO(inf2) changed only slightly in the four experiments by
average values of -0.6, +1.4, and +0.5(permil), respectively. These changes are
small relative to the range of (delta) (sup13)C values represented by different
organic carbon sources to estuaries. Thus, microbial (delta) (sup13)C values
determined in the field helped to identify the source of the carbon assimilated
by bacteria.
