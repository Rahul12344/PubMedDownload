The secondary sex ratio (male births of total births) variation was investigated 
as a function of MHC antigens. Previous studies have indicated that at conception
male zygotes are more frequent than female ones and abortions of male fetuses
prevail. The present investigation addresses the question whether the
histocompatibility relationships either between parents or between mother and
offsprings may favor or hinder the outcome of pregnancy: particular combinations 
may cause distortions in the sex ratio. The results of the analysis of a sample
of fertile families, demonstrate that, in first parities, female births are
favored when parents share antigens at both HLA-A and -B loci (S.R. = 0.389), and
mothers and fetuses share antigens at the HLA-B locus (S.R. = 0.222). The lack of
antigens shared by parents at the three loci HLA-A, -B and -DR increases first
male births (S.R. = 0.696). In the case of fetal maternal histocompatibility at
DR locus only a slight, non-significant, increase in male first births (S.R. =
0.667) was observed. The effect of histocompatibility at HLA-B locus alone
requires further investigation in order to assess the possible selective effect
against male histocompatible embryos.
