Human β-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a potent antimicrobial peptide that participates in
defense against invading bacteria. We recently showed that bacterial components
and histamine, through histamine H4 receptor (H4R), are involved in the
pathogenesis of the potentially malignant lesion, oral lichen planus (OLP).
However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We, therefore, investigated
the role of hBD2-histamine crosstalk signaling in promoting OLP pathology.
Biopsies from OLP and oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) patients, and
healthy controls were used. Two OTSCC cell lines and normal human oral
keratinocytes (HOKs) were used. HBD-2 and other targets were mapped by
immunostaining and analyzed by ImageJ2 software. The highly sensitive
droplet-digital PCR technology and qRT-PCR were utilized to study the clinically 
derived and in vitro samples, respectively. H4R was challenged with the specific 
agonist HST-10 and inverse agonist ST-1007. HBD-2 was highly induced in OLP
lesions. In contrast, hBD2 expression was attenuated in OTSCC tissues, while very
low levels of hBD-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) were observed in OTSCC cells. Together
with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), histamine upregulated hBD-2 mRNA expression
in HOKs. Activation of H4R seems to modulate the expression of epithelial hBD-2. 
These findings suggest the involvement of hBD-2 in the pathogenesis of OLP and
may, thus, be harnessed for therapeutic interventions in OLP.
