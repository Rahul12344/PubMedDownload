There are increasing demands for informative cancer biomarkers, accessible via
minimally invasive procedures, both for initial diagnostics and for follow-up of 
personalized cancer therapy, including immunotherapy. Fine-needle aspiration
(FNA) biopsy provides ready access to relevant tissue samples; however, the
minute amounts of sample require sensitive multiplex molecular analysis to be of 
clinical biomarker utility. We have applied proximity extension assays (PEA) to
analyze 167 proteins in FNA samples from patients with breast cancer (BC; n = 25)
and benign lesions (n = 32). We demonstrate that the FNA BC samples could be
divided into two main clusters, characterized by differences in expression levels
of the estrogen receptor (ER) and the proliferation marker Ki67. This clustering 
corresponded to some extent to established BC subtypes. Our analysis also
revealed several proteins whose expression levels differed between BC and benign 
lesions (e.g., CA9, GZMB, IL-6, VEGFA, CXCL11, PDL1, and PCD1), as well as
several chemokines correlating with ER and Ki67 status (e.g., CCL4, CCL8, CCL20, 
CXCL8, CXCL9, and CXCL17). Finally, we also identified three signatures that
could predict Ki67 status, ER status, and tumor grade, respectively, based on a
small subset of proteins, which was dominated by chemokines. To our knowledge,
expression profiles of CCL13 in benign lesions and BC have not previously been
described but were shown herein to correlate with proliferation (P = 0.00095),
suggesting a role in advanced BC. Given the broad functional range of the
proteins analyzed, immune-related proteins were overrepresented among the
observed alterations. Our pilot study supports the emerging role of chemokines in
BC progression. Due to the minimally traumatic sampling and clinically important 
molecular information for therapeutic decisions, this methodology is promising
for future immunoscoring and monitoring of treatment efficacy in BC.
