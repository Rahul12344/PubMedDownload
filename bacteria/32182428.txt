The chemokines CCL21 and CCL19, through binding of their cognate receptor CCR7,
orchestrate lymph node homing of dendritic cells and naïve T cells. CCL21 differs
from CCL19 via an unstructured 32 residue C-terminal domain. Previously described
roles for the CCL21 C-terminus include GAG-binding, spatial localization to
lymphatic vessels, and autoinhibitory modulation of CCR7-mediated chemotaxis.
While truncation of the C-terminal tail induced chemical shift changes in the
folded chemokine domain, the structural basis for its influence on CCL21 function
remains largely unexplored. CCL21 concentration-dependent NMR chemical shifts
revealed weak, nonphysiological self-association that mimics the truncation of
the C-terminal tail. We generated a series of C-terminal truncation variants to
dissect the C-terminus influence on CCL21 structure and receptor activation.
Using NMR spectroscopy, we found that CCL21 residues 80-90 mediate contacts with 
the chemokine domain. In cell-based assays for CCR7 and ACKR4 activation, we also
found that residues 92-100 reduced CCL21 potency in calcium flux, cAMP
inhibition, and β-arrestin recruitment. Taken together, these structure-function 
studies support a model wherein intramolecular interactions with specific
residues of the flexible C-terminus stabilize a less active monomer conformation 
of the CCL21. We speculate that the autoinhibitory intramolecular contacts
between the C-terminal tail and chemokine body are disrupted by GAG binding
and/or interactions with the CCR7 receptor to ensure optimal functionality.
