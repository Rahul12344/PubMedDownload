Background: The vital enzymes of starch digestion and absorption are intestinal
α-glucosidases and their inhibition improves postprandial hyperglycaemia,
constituting an effective mode of therapy in diabetes.
Objectives: The present study was designed to assess the inhibitory potential of 
ethanol extract of banana flower (EF) on mammalian α-glucosidases and its
pharmacological effects on postprandial hyperglycaemia in normal and
alloxan-induced diabetic rats.
Materials and Methods: EF was evaluated for its inhibitory potential and mode of 
inhibition on mammalian α-glucosidases. Further, the role of EF and its
constituents Umbelliferone (C1) and Lupeol (C2) on glucose uptake using isolated 
rat hemi-diaphragm and insulinotropic activity using RINm5F (rat insulinoma) cell
lines were determined. The phytocomponents in EF were also evaluated using GC-MS.
Results: EF illustrated a dose-dependent inhibition for rat intestinal sucrase,
maltase and p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) hydrolysis (IC50 values:
18.76±0.22, 25.54±0.10 and 76.42±1.12 µg/ml, respectively) and the mode of
inhibition was non-competitive with low Ki values. Oral administration (100-200
mg/kg b.wt.) of EF significantly improved the maltose/glucose-induced
postprandial hyperglycaemia in normal and alloxan-induced diabetic rats. EF, C1
and C2 exhibited stimulation of glucose uptake and a dose-dependent
glucose-induced insulin secretion at both 4.5 and 16.7 mM glucose concentrations.
Further, GC-MS analysis revealed significant levels of steroids (25.61%),
diazoprogesterone (21.31%), sesquiterpene (11.78%) and other phytocomponents.
Conclusion: EF inhibited α-glucosidases besides promoting glucose uptake and
insulin secretion, resulting in antihyperglycaemic effect determining EF as a
potent anti-diabetic agent.Abbreviations used: mg/dl: milligramsper deciliter,
