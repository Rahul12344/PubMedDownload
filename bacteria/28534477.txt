Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) assemble a large group of structurally
and functionally diverse natural products. While the iterative catalytic
mechanism of bacterial NRPSs is known, it remains unclear how fungal NRPSs create
products of desired length. Here we show that fungal iterative NRPSs adopt an
alternate incorporation strategy. Beauvericin and bassianolide synthetases have
the same C1-A1-T1-C2-A2-MT-T2a-T2b-C3 domain organization. During catalysis, C3
and C2 take turns to incorporate the two biosynthetic precursors into the growing
depsipeptide chain that swings between T1 and T2a/T2b with C3 cyclizing the chain
when it reaches the full length. We reconstruct the total biosynthesis of
beauvericin in vitro by reacting C2 and C3 with two SNAC-linked precursors and
present a domain swapping approach to reprogramming these enzymes for peptides
with altered lengths. These findings highlight the difference between bacterial
and fungal NRPS mechanisms and provide a framework for the enzymatic synthesis of
non-natural nonribosomal peptides.
