Human ganglioside-like structures, such as GM1, found on some Campylobacter
jejuni strains have been linked to inducing the Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS).
This study shows that a C. jejuni strain without GM1-like molecules acquired
large DNA fragments, including lipooligosaccharide synthesis genes, from a strain
expressing GM1-like molecules and consequently transformed into a number of
potential GBS-inducible transformants, which exhibited a high degree of genetic
and phenotypic diversity.
