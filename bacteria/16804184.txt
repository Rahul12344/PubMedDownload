Functional interaction between bacterial surface-displayed autoaggregation
proteins such as antigen 43 (Ag43) of Escherichia coli and motility organelles
such as flagella has not previously been described. Here, it has been
demonstrated for the first time that Ag43-mediated aggregation can inhibit
bacterial motility. Ag43 overexpression produces a dominant aggregation phenotype
that overrides motility in the presence of low levels of flagella. In contrast,
induction of an increased flagellation state prevents Ag43-mediated aggregation. 
This phenomenon was observed in naturally occurring subpopulations of E. coli as 
phase variants expressing and not expressing Ag43 revealed contrasting motility
phenotypes. The effects were shown to be part of a general mechanism because
other short adhesins capable of mediating autoaggregation (AIDA-I and TibA) also 
impaired motility. These novel insights into the function of bacterial
autoaggregation proteins suggest that a balance between these two systems, i.e.
autoaggregation and flagellation, influences motility.
