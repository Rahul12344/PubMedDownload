BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is frequently caused by gram-negative pathogens, among
which Klebsiella pneumoniae prominently features. Recognition of
pathogen-associated molecular patterns by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is important
for an appropriate immune response during infection. TLR signaling can proceed
via 2 distinct routes that are dependent on the adaptor proteins Myeloid
differentiation primary response gene (88) (MyD88) and TIR-domain-containing
adaptor-inducing interferon-Î² (TRIF). The aim of the study was to determine the
relative contribution of MyD88 and TRIF signaling in resident and hematopoietic
cells to host defense during pneumonia.
METHODS: Bone marrow chimeras of MyD88 deficient/wild type and TRIF mutant/wild
type mice were created and infected with K. pneumoniae via the airways.
RESULTS: MyD88 in both resident and hematopoietic cells contributed to survival
and antibacterial defense in late-stage infection, whereas only TRIF in
hematopoietic cells was protective. On the other hand, resident MyD88 and
hematopoietic TRIF contributed to distant cellular injury. Resident MyD88 was
pivotal for early chemokine release and neutrophil recruitment in the
bronchoalveolar space.
CONCLUSIONS: MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling has a differential contribution 
to host defense in different cell types that changes from early- to late-stage
gram-negative pneumonia.
