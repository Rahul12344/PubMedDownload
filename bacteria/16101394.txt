Studies of the human defensins have been hampered by the lack of a simple
expression system allowing for rapid production of functional peptide forms.
Here, we describe a Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH22 expression system that meets
that condition. The 42 amino acid form of human beta-defensin-1 was expressed
under the control of the ADH1 promoter. The optimum conditions for expression
were determined and the stable maintenance of the pVT103L-hBD-1 chimeric vector
in the yeast population was confirmed. Expressed hBD-1 was secreted into the
medium (approximately 55 microg l(-1)) and purified using cation-exchange
chromatography. Isolated defensin exhibited strong bactericidal effect on
Escherichia coli ML-35p. We conclude that the expression system described here
will be a useful tool where readily prepared and active forms of the human
defensins are needed.
