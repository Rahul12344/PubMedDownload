Toll-like receptors (TLR) are crucial pattern recognition receptors in innate
immunity. The importance of TLR2 in host defense against Gram-positive bacteria
has been suggested by the fact that this receptor recognizes major Gram-positive 
cell wall components, such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid. To determine
the role of TLR2 in pulmonary Gram-positive infection, we first established that 
TLR2 is indispensable for alveolar macrophage responsiveness toward Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Nonetheless, TLR2 gene-deficient mice intranasally inoculated with S.
pneumoniae at doses varying from nonlethal (with complete clearance of the
infection) to lethal displayed only a modestly reduced inflammatory response in
their lungs and an unaltered antibacterial defense when compared with normal
wild-type mice. These data suggest that TLR2 plays a limited role in the innate
immune response to pneumococcal pneumonia, and that additional pattern
recognition receptors likely are involved in host defense against this common
respiratory pathogen.
