Defective expression or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) underlies the hypersusceptibility of cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients to chronic airway infections, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 
CFTR is involved in the specific recognition of P. aeruginosa, thereby
contributing to effective innate immunity and proper hydration of the airway
surface layer (ASL). In CF, the airway epithelium fails to initiate an
appropriate innate immune response, allowing the microbe to bind to mucus plugs
that are then not properly cleared because of the dehydrated ASL. Recent studies 
have identified numerous CFTR-dependent factors that are recruited to the
epithelial plasma membrane in response to infection and that are needed for
bacterial clearance, a process that is defective in CF patients hypersusceptible 
to infection with this organism.
