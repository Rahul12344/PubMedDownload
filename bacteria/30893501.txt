There is an urgent need for new treatments effective against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The 8-hydroxyquinoline series 
is a privileged scaffold with anticancer, antifungal, and antibacterial
activities. We conducted a structure-activity relationship study of the series
regarding its antitubercular activity using 26 analogs. The 8-hydroxyquinolines
showed good activity against M. tuberculosis, with minimum inhibitory
concentrations (MIC90) of <5 μM for some analogs. Small substitutions at C5
resulted in the most potent activity. Substitutions at C2 generally decreased
potency, although a sub-family of 2-styryl-substituted analogs retained activity.
Representative compounds demonstrated bactericidal activity against replicating
M. tuberculosis with >4 log kill at 10× MIC over 14 days. The majority of the
compounds demonstrated cytotoxicity (IC50 of <100 μM). Further development of
this series as antitubercular agents should address the cytotoxicity liability.
However, the 8-hydroxyquinoline series represents a useful tool for chemical
genomics to identify novel targets in M. tuberculosis.
