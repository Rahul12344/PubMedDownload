INTRODUCTION: Available evidence from observational studies and meta-analyses has
highlighted an increased mortality in patients with carbapenem-resistant
Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) bloodstream infections (BSI) compared with their
carbapenem-susceptible (CSKP) counterparts, but the exact reasons for this
outcome difference are still to be determined.
METHODS: We updated the search of a previous meta-analysis through four databases
up to April 2018. A two-stage individual-patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was
conducted, building an adjusting model to account for age, comorbidities and
activity of empirical and targeted antimicrobial therapy. The protocol was
registered on PROSPERO (identifier: CRD42018104256).
RESULTS: IPD data were obtained from 14 out of 28 eligible observational studies.
A total of 1952 patients were investigated: 1093 in the CRKP group and 859 in the
CSKP group. Patients with CRKP-BSI had a twofold risk of death compared with
CSKP-infected patients [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.17; 95% confidence interval
(CI) 1.56-3.04; I2 = 44.1%]. Mortality was higher in patients with CRKP BSI, in
both the subgroup of absent/inactive (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.24-2.47; I2 = 0) and of 
active initial therapy (aOR 2.66; 95% CI 1.70-4.16; I2 = 16%) as well as in case 
of active targeted therapy (aOR 2.21; 95% CI 1.36-3.59; I2 = 58%).
CONCLUSION: Resistance to carbapenem is associated with worse outcome in patients
with BSI by Klebsiella pneumoniae even adjusting for comorbidities and treatment 
appropriateness according to in vitro activity of empirical and targeted therapy.
This applies to a scenario dominated by colistin-based therapies for CRKP.
Further studies are needed to compare the mortality difference between CRKP and
CSKP cases in the light of new anti-CRKP antimicrobials.
