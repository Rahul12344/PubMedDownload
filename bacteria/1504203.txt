Based in 184 cases of Typhoid Fever bacteriologically demonstrated in the past 14
years (greater than 90% of all cases registered in the whole province), we have
observed that, with the exception of some epidemic outbreaks, the disease has
been constantly present during all these years, with a higher incidence between
August and November. Salmonella typhi infected primarily young adults, its
distribution being similar to the one among the general population. 49% of cases 
were males. The estimated incidence rate of the disease during this period was
2-3 per 100,000 population. A seroepidemiological study among healthy women with 
ages between 20 and 40 years showed a seroprevalence of anti-H:d antibodies
greater than or equal to 1/40 of 1%. Although the epidemiological situation of
Typhoid fever in our environment is not as bad as it has been referred in reports
and textbooks, an effort is needed to situate the problem at the appropriate
level, given our geographical situation and our economical development.
