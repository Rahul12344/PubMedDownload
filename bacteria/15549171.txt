Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the first human homologue of ACE to be 
described. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane protein which functions as a
carboxypeptidase, cleaving a single hydrophobic/basic residue from the C-terminus
of its substrates. ACE2 efficiently hydrolyses the potent vasoconstrictor
angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7). It is a consequence of this action that ACE2
participates in the renin-angiotensin system. However, ACE2 also hydrolyses
dynorphin A (1-13), apelin-13 and des-Arg(9) bradykinin. The role of ACE2 in
these peptide systems has yet to be revealed. A physiological role for ACE2 has
been implicated in hypertension, cardiac function, heart function and diabetes,
and as a receptor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. This
paper reviews the biochemistry of ACE2 and discusses key findings such as the
elucidation of crystal structures for ACE2 and testicular ACE and the development
of ACE2 inhibitors that have now provided a basis for future research on this
enzyme.
