Due to antibacterial characteristic, amnion has been frequently used in different
clinical situations. Developing an in vitro method to augment endogenous
antibacterial ingredient of amniotic epithelial and mesenchymal stem cells is
desirable for a higher efficacy of this promising biomaterial. In this study,
epithelial or mesenchymal side dependent effect of amniotic membrane (AM) on
antibacterial activity against some laboratory and clinical isolated strains was 
investigated by modified disk diffusion method and colony count assay. The effect
of exposure to IL-1β in production and release of antibacterial ingredients was
investigated by ELISA assay. The results showed that there is no significant
difference between epithelial and mesenchymal sides of amnion in inhibition of
bacterial growth. Although the results of disk diffusion showed that the AM
inhibitory effect depends on bacterial genus and strain, colony count assay
showed that the extract of AM inhibits all investigated bacterial strains. The
exposure of AM to IL-1β leads to a higher level of antibacterial peptides
secretion including elafin, HBD-2, HBD-3 and cathelicidic LL-37. Based on these
results, amniotic cells possess antibacterial activity which can be augmented by 
inflammatory signal inducers; a process which make amnion and its epithelial and 
mesenchymal stem cells more suitable for tissue engineering and regenerative
medicine.
