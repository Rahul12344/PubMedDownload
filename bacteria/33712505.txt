PURPOSE: To assess the association between respiratory muscle weakness (RMW) at
intensive care unit (ICU) discharge and 5-year mortality and morbidity,
independent from confounders including peripheral muscle strength.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of the prospective 5-year follow-up of the EPaNIC
cohort (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00512122), limited to 366 patients screened for
respiratory and peripheral muscle strength in the ICU with maximal inspiratory
pressure (MIP) after removal of the artificial airway, and the Medical Research
Council sum score. RMW was defined as an absolute value of MIP <30 cmH2O.
Associations between RMW at (or closest to) ICU discharge and all-cause 5-year
mortality, and key measures of 5-year physical function, comprising respiratory
muscle strength (MIP), hand-grip strength (HGF), 6 min walk distance (6MWD) and
physical function of the SF-36 quality-of-life questionnaire (PF-SF-36), were
assessed with Cox proportional hazards and linear regression models, adjusted for
confounders including peripheral muscle strength.
RESULTS: RMW was present in 136/366 (37.2%) patients at ICU discharge. RMW was
not independently associated with 5-year mortality (HR with 95% CI 1.273 (0.751
to 1.943), p=0.352). Among 156five-year survivors, those with, as compared with
those without RMW demonstrated worse physical function (MIP (absolute value,
cmH2O): 62(42-77) vs 94(78-109), p<0.001; HGF (%pred): 67(44-87) vs 96(68-110),
p<0.001; 6MWD (%pred): 87(74-102) vs 99 (80-111), p=0.009; PF-SF-36 (score): 55
(30-80) vs 80 (55-95), p<0.001). Associations between RMW and morbidity endpoints
remained significant after adjustment for confounders (effect size with 95% CI:
MIP: -23.858 (-32.097 to -15.027), p=0.001; HGF: -18.591 (-30.941 to -5.744),
p=0.001; 6MWD (transformed): -1587.007 (-3073.763 to -179.253), p=0.034; PF-SF-36
(transformed): 1.176 (0.144-2.270), p=0.036).
CONCLUSIONS: RMW at ICU discharge is independently associated with 5-year
morbidity but not 5-year mortality.
