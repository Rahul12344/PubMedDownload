Salmonella infections can be life-threatening. SiiE is a giant adhesion molecule 
of 5559 amino acids that is encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 4 (SPI4)
and that promotes the initial contact between the pathogen and polarized
epithelial cells in the intestine of the host. Starting from an engineered
deletion version of SiiE (mini-SiiE; 97 kDa), limited proteolysis was used to
reproducibly generate a 30 kDa fragment that readily crystallized. Mass
spectrometry hints that this fragment spans the predicted Ig domains 50-52 of
SiiE. Crystals of both native and selenomethionine-labelled protein could be
obtained in space group C2 and diffraction data were recorded to a resolution of 
1.85 Å.
