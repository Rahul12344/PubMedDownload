Members of the LC3/GABARAP family of ubiquitin-like proteins function during
autophagy by serving as membrane linked protein-binding platforms. Their
C-termini are physically attached to membranes through covalent linkage to
primary amines on lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine, while their
ubiquitin-like fold domains bind "LIR" (LC3-Interacting Region) sequences found
within an extraordinarily diverse array of proteins including regulators of
autophagy, adaptors that recruit ubiquitinated cargoes to be degraded, and even
proteins controlling processes at membranes that are not associated with
autophagy. Recently, LC3/GABARAP proteins were found to bind the ubiquitin E3
ligase NEDD4 to influence ubiquitination associated with autophagy in human cell 
lines. Here, we use purified recombinant proteins to define LC3B interactions
with a specific LIR sequence from NEDD4, present a crystal structure showing
atomic details of the interaction, and show that LC3B-binding can steer intrinsic
NEDD4 E3 ligase activity. The data provide detailed molecular insights underlying
recruitment of an E3 ubiquitin ligase to phagophores during autophagy.
