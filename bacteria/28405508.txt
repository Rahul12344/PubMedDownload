Recent clinical studies indicate that adoptive T-cell therapy and especially
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is a very potent and potentially
curative treatment for B-lineage hematologic malignancies. Currently, autologous 
peripheral blood T cells are used for adoptive T-cell therapy. Adoptive T cells
derived from healthy allogeneic donors may have several advantages; however, the 
expected occurrence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) as a consequence of the
diverse allogeneic T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire expressed by these cells
compromises this approach. Here, we generated T cells from cord blood
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) that were transduced to express an antigen 
receptor (AR): either a CAR or a TCR with or without built-in CD28 co-stimulatory
domains. These AR-transgenic HPCs were culture-expanded on an OP9-DL1 feeder
layer and subsequently differentiated to CD5+CD7+ T-lineage precursors, to CD4+
CD8+ double positive cells and finally to mature AR+ T cells. The AR+ T cells
were largely naive CD45RA+CD62L+ T cells. These T cells had mostly germline TCRα 
and TCRβ loci and therefore lacked surface-expressed CD3/TCRαβ complexes. The
CD3- AR-transgenic cells were mono-specific, functional T cells as they displayed
specific cytotoxic activity. Cytokine production, including IL-2, was prominent
in those cells bearing ARs with built-in CD28 domains. Data sustain the concept
that cord blood HPC derived, in vitro generated allogeneic CD3- AR+ T cells can
be used to more effectively eliminate malignant cells, while at the same time
limiting the occurrence of GvHD.
