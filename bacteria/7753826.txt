An approach was developed for the isolation and characterization of soybean
plasma membrane-associated proteins by immunoscreening of a cDNA expression
library. An antiserum was raised against purified plasma membrane vesicles. In a 
differential screening of approximately 500,000 plaque-forming units with the
anti-(plasma membrane) serum and DNA probes derived from highly abundant clones
isolated in a preliminary screening, 261 clones were selected from approximately 
1,200 antiserum-positive plaques. These clones were classified into 40 groups by 
hybridization analysis and 5'- and 3'-terminal sequencing. By searching nucleic
acid and protein sequence data bases, 11 groups of cDNAs were identified, among
which valosin-containing protein (VCP), clathrin heavy chain, phospholipase C,
and S-adenosylmethionine:delta 24-sterol-C-methyltransferase have not to date
been cloned from plants. The remaining 29 groups did not match any current data
base entries and may, therefore, represent additional or yet uncharacterized
genes. A full-length cDNA encoding the soybean VCP was sequenced. The high level 
of amino acid identity with vertebrate VCP and yeast CDC48 protein indicates that
the soybean protein is a plant homolog of vertebrate VCP and yeast CDC48 protein.
