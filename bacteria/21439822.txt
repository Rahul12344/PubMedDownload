The cholesterol metabolism pathway in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) is a
potential source of energy as well as secondary metabolite production that is
important for survival of M. tb in the host macrophage. Oxidation and
isomerization of 3β-hydroxysterols to 4-en-3-ones is requisite for sterol
metabolism and the reaction is catalyzed by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
(Rv1106c). Three series of 6-azasteroids and 4-azasteroids were employed to
define the substrate preferences of M. tb 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
6-Azasteroids with large, hydrophobic side chains at the C17 position are the
most effective inhibitors. Substitutions at C1, C2, C4 and N6 were poorly
tolerated. Our structure-activity studies indicate that the 6-aza version of
cholesterol is the best and tightest binding competitive inhibitor (K(i)=100 nM) 
of the steroid substrate and are consistent with cholesterol being the preferred 
substrate of M. tb 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.
