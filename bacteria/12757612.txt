This review attempts to illuminate the glycolipid antigen presentation properties
of CD1d, how CD1d controls the function of natural T (iNKT) cells and how CD1d
and iNKT cells interact to jump-start the immune system. It is postulated that
the CD1d-iNKT cell system functions as a sensor, sensing alterations in cellular 
lipid content by virtue of its affinity for such ligands. The presentation of a
neo-self glycolipid, presumably by infectious assault of antigen-presenting
cells, activates iNKT cells, which promptly release pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines and jump-start the immune system.
