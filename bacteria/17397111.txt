The extract of the plant Rheum officinale Baill, mainly containing the
anthraquinones physcion and chrysophanol, is highly active against plant powdery 
mildew. Experiments were conducted in the laboratory and greenhouse to determine 
the interaction of the two compounds on cucumber powdery mildew [Sphaerotheca
fuliginea (Schlecht.) Poll] and on wheat powdery mildew [Blumeria graminis (DC.) 
Speer f. sp. tritici Marchal]. Physcion was much more bioactive than chrysophanol
against these powdery mildews. There was a significant synergistic interaction
between the two compounds on the diseases when the ratios of physcion to
chrysophanol ranged from 1:9 to 5:5. The synergistic degree increased with
increase in the chrysophanol proportion in the combination. The findings indicate
that, in order to ensure constant efficacy of the extract on the disease, both
the contents and the proportion of the main active ingredients physcion and
chrysophanol have to be determined.
