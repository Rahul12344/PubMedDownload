Chemokines play a crucial role in combating microbial infection by recruiting
blood neutrophils to infected tissue. In mice, the chemokines Cxcl1/KC and
Cxcl2/MIP2 fulfill this role. Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 exist as monomers and dimers, and
exert their function by activating the Cxcr2 receptor and binding
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Here, we characterized Cxcr2 G protein and β-arrestin 
activities, and GAG heparan sulfate (HS) interactions of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 and of
the trapped dimeric variants. To understand how Cxcr2 and GAG interactions impact
in vivo function, we characterized their neutrophil recruitment activity to the
peritoneum, Cxcr2 and CD11b levels on peritoneal and blood neutrophils, and
transport profiles out of the peritoneum. Cxcl2 variants compared with Cxcl1
variants were more potent for Cxcr2 activity. Native Cxcl1 compared with native
Cxcl2 and dimers compared with native proteins bound HS with higher affinity.
Interestingly, recruitment activity between native Cxcl1 and Cxcl2, between
dimers, and between the native protein and the dimer could be similar or very
different depending on the dose or the time point. These data indicate that
peritoneal neutrophil recruitment cannot be solely attributed to Cxcr2 or GAG
interactions, and that the relationship between recruited neutrophils, Cxcr2
activation, GAG interactions, and chemokine levels is complex and highly context 
dependent. We propose that the ability of Cxcl1 and Cxcl2 to reversibly exist as 
monomers and dimers and differences in their Cxcr2 activity and GAG interactions 
coordinate neutrophil recruitment and activation, which play a critical role for 
successful resolution of inflammation.
