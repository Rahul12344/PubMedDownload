The X-ray structure determination at 2.4 Å resolution of the putative orsellinic 
acid C3 O-methyltransferase (CalO1) involved in calicheamicin biosynthesis is
reported. Comparison of CalO1 with a homology model of the functionally related
calicheamicin orsellinic acid C2 O-methyltransferase (CalO6) implicates several
residues that are likely to contribute to the regiospecificity of alkylation.
Consistent with the proposed requirement of an acyl-carrier-protein-bound
substrate, this structural study also reveals structural determinants within
CalO1 that are anticipated to accommodate an association with an acyl carrier
protein.
