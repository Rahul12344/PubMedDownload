Campylobacter strains isolated during a one-year study from a municipal waste
water treatment plant have been characterized. The study shows a considerable
release of Campylobacter strains into the receiving linked river system.
Campylobacters isolated here, are very similar to isolates originating from
enteritic cases. In contrast to other reports we conclude that the strains
released from the sewage treatment plant into the environment represent a
potential risk for public health.
