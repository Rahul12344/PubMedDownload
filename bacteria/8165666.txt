413 swabs of dogs and cats ears were examined microbiologically. Bacteria could
be isolated in 82% and yeasts or moulds in 28% of the cases. The most common
bacteria species were coagulase-positive Staphylococci, Pseudomonas spp.,
beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Proteus spp. with Staphylococci being the most
common isolate. Within the group of yeasts and moulds Malassezia pachydermatis
was isolated most frequently (90%). From the results of in vitro antibiotic
tests, a general recommendation for the treatment of otitis externa
nonparasitaria could not be given.
