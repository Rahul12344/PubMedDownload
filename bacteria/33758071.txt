Diffuse alveolar damage and thrombi are the most common lung histopathological
lesions reported in patients with severe COVID-19. Although some studies have
suggested increased pulmonary angiogenesis, the presence of vascular
proliferation in COVID-19 lungs has not been well characterised. Glomeruloid-like
microscopic foci and/or coalescent vascular proliferations measuring up to 2 cm
were present in the lung of 14 out of 16 autopsied patients. These lesions
expressed CD31, CD34 and vascular endothelial cadherin. Platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-β immunohistochemistry and dual immunostaining for CD34/smooth
muscle actin demonstrated the presence of pericytes. These vascular alterations
may contribute to the severe and refractory hypoxaemia that is common in patients
with severe COVID-19.
