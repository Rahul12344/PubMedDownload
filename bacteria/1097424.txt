Discontinuous replication of colicin E1 plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid.

Inselburg J, Oka A.

The plasmid pML 21, which was found to contain approximately 49% of the Col E1
genome was used to determine the template origin of single-stranded
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments (4 to 32% of the Col E1 units length)
associated with Col E1 dna replicative intermediates. The results of DNA
hybridization competition experiments indicate that the single-stranded fragments
derive from the full length of the Col E1 DNA template as expected for Okazaki
fragments and the plasmid pML 21 contains the replication origin of Col E1 DNA.
