N-(2-{[2-(1H-Indol-2-ylcarbonyl)hydrazinyl](oxo)acetyl}phenyl)acetamides (5a⁻h)
and
N-[2-(2-{[2-(acetylamino)phenyl](oxo)acetyl}hydrazinyl)-2-oxoethyl]-1H-indole-2-c
arboxamides (5i⁻l) were synthesized and characterized with different analytical
tools. N-Acetylisatines 4a⁻d were subjected to ring opening at their C2 carbons
with the aid of different indole-bearing hydrazides 3a,b and 7 to afford the
respective glyoxylamides 5a⁻l. The antimicrobial activity of the target compounds
5a⁻l was assessed with the aid of Diameter of the Inhibition Zone (DIZ) and
Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) assays against a panel of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria and certain fungal strains. The antimicrobial
screening revealed that Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Candida albicans are the most sensitive microorganisms towards
the synthesized compounds 5a⁻l. In addition, compounds 5c and 5h emerged as the
most active congeners towards Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans,
respectively. Molecular docking studies revealed the possible binding mode of
compounds 5c and 5h to their target proteins.
