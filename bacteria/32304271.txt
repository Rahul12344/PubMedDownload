INTRODUCTION: The correctness of the results of automated platelet analysis is
still highly debated. The aim of this multicenter study, conducted according to
international guidelines, was to verify the analytical performance of nine
different types of hematology analyzers (HAs) in the automated platelet analysis.
METHODS: Four hundred eighty-six peripheral blood samples (PB), collected in K3
EDTA tubes, were analyzed by ABX Pentra, ADVIA2120i, BC-6800, BC-6800 Plus,
Cell-DYN Sapphire, DxH800, XE-2100, XE-5000, XN-20 with PLT-F App. Within-run
imprecision and between-run imprecision were carried out using PB and material
control, respectively. The carryover, low limit of quantification (LoQ), and the 
PB stability were evaluated.
RESULTS: The carryover was absent for all HAs. The LoQ of PLT ranged between 2.0 
(Cell-Dyn Sapphire) and 25.0 × 109 /L (ADVIA 2120i), while immature platelet
fraction (IPF) ranged between 1.0 (XN-20) and 12.0 × 109 /L (XE-5000). The
imprecision (%CV) increases as the platelet count decreases. No HAs showed
desirable CVAPS for PLT counts less than 50.0 × 109 /L, with the exception of
Cell-DYN Sapphire (CV 3.0% with PLT-O mean value of 26.7 × 109 /L), XN-20 (CV
2.4% with PLT-F mean value of 21.5 × 109 /L), and BC-6800 Plus (CV 1.9% with
PLT-O mean value of 26.5 × 109 /L). The sample stability ranged between under two
hours for MPV by ADVIA2120i and 8 hours for other PLT parameters and HAs.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study may provide useful information regarding
carryover, precision, and stability of platelet counts and parameters, especially
in thrombocytopenic samples. Moreover, the stability of sample for platelet
analysis is conditioned by the HA and by temperature and storage time.
