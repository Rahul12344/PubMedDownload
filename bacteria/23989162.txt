The genome of Vibrio cholerae encodes two higBA toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules that
are activated by amino-acid starvation. Here, the TA complex of the second
module, higBA2, as well as the C-terminal domain of the corresponding HigA2
antitoxin, have been purified and crystallized. The HigBA2 complex crystallized
in two crystal forms. Crystals of form I belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2, with
unit-cell parameters a = 129.0, b = 119.8, c = 33.4 Å, and diffracted to 3.0 Å
resolution. The asymmetric unit is likely to contain a single complex consisting 
of two toxin monomers and one antitoxin dimer. The second crystal form
crystallized in space group P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = 134.5, c =
55.4 Å. These crystals diffracted to 2.2 Å resolution and probably contain a
complex with a different stoichiometry. Crystals of the C-terminal domain of
HigA2 belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 115.4, b = 61.2, 
c = 73.8 Å, β = 106.7°, and diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution.
