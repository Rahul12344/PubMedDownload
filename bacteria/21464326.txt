Src family kinases (SFKs) are pleiotropic activators that are responsible for
integrating signal transduction for multiple receptors that regulate cellular
proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in a variety of human cancers.
Independent groups have identified increased expression of individual SFK members
during prostate cancer progression, raising the question of whether SFKs display 
functional equivalence. Here, we show that Src kinase, followed by Fyn kinase and
then Lyn kinase, exhibit ranked tumorigenic potential during both
paracrine-induced and cell-autonomous-initiated prostate cancer. This
quantitative variation in transformation potential appears to be regulated in
part by posttranslational palmitoylation. Our data indicate that development of
inhibitors against specific SFK members could provide unique targeted therapeutic
strategies.
