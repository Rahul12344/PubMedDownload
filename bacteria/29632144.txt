Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by T cell-mediated destruction of the
insulin-producing β cells of the pancreatic islets. Among the loci associated
with T1D risk, those most predisposing are found in the MHC region. HLA-B*39:06
is the most predisposing class I MHC allele and is associated with an early age
of onset. To establish an NOD mouse model for the study of HLA-B*39:06, we
expressed it in the absence of murine class I MHC. HLA-B*39:06 was able to
mediate the development of CD8 T cells, support lymphocytic infiltration of the
islets, and confer T1D susceptibility. Because reduced thymic insulin expression 
is associated with impaired immunological tolerance to insulin and increased T1D 
risk in patients, we incorporated this in our model as well, finding that
HLA-B*39:06-transgenic NOD mice with reduced thymic insulin expression have an
earlier age of disease onset and a higher overall prevalence as compared with
littermates with typical thymic insulin expression. This was despite virtually
indistinguishable blood insulin levels, T cell subset percentages, and TCR Vβ
family usage, confirming that reduced thymic insulin expression does not impact T
cell development on a global scale. Rather, it will facilitate the thymic escape 
of insulin-reactive HLA-B*39:06-restricted T cells, which participate in β cell
destruction. We also found that in mice expressing either HLA-B*39:06 or
HLA-A*02:01 in the absence of murine class I MHC, HLA transgene identity alters
TCR Vβ usage by CD8 T cells, demonstrating that some TCR Vβ families have a
preference for particular class I MHC alleles.
