High-resolution three-dimensional structures of essential Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins provide templates for TB drug design, but are
available for only a small fraction of the Mtb proteome. Here we evaluate an
intra-genus "homolog-rescue" strategy to increase the structural information
available for TB drug discovery by using mycobacterial homologs with conserved
active sites. Of 179 potential TB drug targets selected for x-ray structure
determination, only 16 yielded a crystal structure. By adding 1675 homologs from 
nine other mycobacterial species to the pipeline, structures representing an
additional 52 otherwise intractable targets were solved. To determine whether
these homolog structures would be useful surrogates in TB drug design, we
compared the active sites of 106 pairs of Mtb and non-TB mycobacterial (NTM)
enzyme homologs with experimentally determined structures, using three metrics of
active site similarity, including superposition of continuous pharmacophoric
property distributions. Pair-wise structural comparisons revealed that 19/22
pairs with >55% overall sequence identity had active site Cα RMSD <1 Å, >85% side
chain identity, and ≥80% PSAPF (similarity based on pharmacophoric properties)
indicating highly conserved active site shape and chemistry. Applying these
results to the 52 NTM structures described above, 41 shared >55% sequence
identity with the Mtb target, thus increasing the effective structural coverage
of the 179 Mtb targets over three-fold (from 9% to 32%). The utility of these
structures in TB drug design can be tested by designing inhibitors using the
homolog structure and assaying the cognate Mtb enzyme; a promising test case, Mtb
cytidylate kinase, is described. The homolog-rescue strategy evaluated here for
TB is also generalizable to drug targets for other diseases.
