Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial infections in the United
States. Clinical disease outcomes after C. difficile infection (CDI) are
dependent on intensity of host inflammatory responses. Specifically, peak
peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count >20 × 109 l-1 is an indicator of adverse 
outcomes in CDI patients, and is associated with higher 30-day mortality. We show
that homozygosity for a common single nucleotide polymorphism (Q to R mutation in
leptin receptor that is present in up to 50% of people), significantly increases 
the risk of having peak peripheral WBC count >20 × 109 l-1 (odds ratio=5.41;
P=0.0023) in CDI patients. In a murine model of CDI, we demonstrate that mice
homozygous for the same single nucleotide polymorphism (RR mice) have more blood 
and tissue leukocytes (specifically neutrophils), exaggerated tissue
inflammation, and higher mortality as compared with control mice, despite similar
pathogen burden. Further, we show that neutrophilia in RR mice is mediated by gut
microbiota-directed expression of CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), which
promotes the release of neutrophils from bone marrow reservoir. Overall these
studies provide novel mechanistic insights into the role of human genetic
polymorphisms and gut microbiota in regulating the fundamental biological process
of CDI-induced neutrophilia.
