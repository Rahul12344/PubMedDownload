Nucleostemin (NS) is a novel protein that promotes the proliferation of stem
cells and cancer cells. The aim of this study is to prepare specific monoclonal
antibodies against nucleostemin as a tool in nucleostemin research. To generate
the antibodies, the cDNA coding nucleostemin was cloned from human gastric cancer
cell line NCI-N87 with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
The partial cDNA fragment was inserted into prokaryotic expression vector
pGEX-4T1 to make glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein in Escherichia
coli, and the whole-length cDNA fragment was cloned into vector pcDNA3 for
expression in mammalian cells. The spleen cells, from the BALB/c mouse immunized 
with the GST-nucleostemin fusion protein, were used to prepare the monoclonal
antibody with hybridoma technique. After screening with enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and subcloning, six specific monoclonal antibodies
against nucleostemin were obtained. Moreover, they also worked well in Western
blotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry. These antibodies will be
helpful in elucidating biological functions and the molecular mechanism of
nucleostemin.
