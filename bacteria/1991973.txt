The W and P elements are cis-acting transcriptional regulators of the human class
II MHC gene HLA-DRA necessary for maximal promoter activity in DR+ B cells.
Proteins that bind specifically to W may mediate promoter activity from a DNA
segment containing W and P (W/P). In this report, we demonstrate that a -143 to
-123 bp region that lacks P is sufficient to mediate the W elements function and 
to bind the W proteins W-B1 and W-B2 in the Raji B-lymphoblastoid cell line. In
contrast to previous reports, we find that W/P is not a B cell-specific element; 
rather that its promoter activity parallels active transcription of the
endogenous DRA gene. In addition, we show that tissue-restricted regulation by
W/P is not correlated with the ubiquitous (W-B1) and lymphoid-specific (W-B2)
distribution of the W binding proteins. We suggest that mechanisms in addition to
binding to W may account for W/P-dependent transcriptional activation in DR+
cells.
