BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, are
implicated in lymphomagenesis. We evaluated whether genetic variations in
microRNA coding regions, binding sites, or biogenesis genes (collectively
referred to as miRNA-SNPs) were associated with risk of AIDS-associated
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AIDS-NHL), and serum levels of four lymphoma-related
microRNAs.
METHODS: Twenty-five miRNA-SNPs were genotyped in 180 AIDS-NHL cases and 529
HIV-infected matched controls from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and 
real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify serum microRNA levels.
Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) estimated using conditional logistic regression
evaluated associations between miRNA-SNPs and AIDS-NHL risk. A semi-Bayes
shrinkage approach was employed to reduce likelihood of false-positive
associations. Adjusted mean ratios (MR) calculated using linear regression
assessed associations between miRNA-SNPs and serum microRNA levels.
RESULTS: DDX20 rs197412, a non-synonymous miRNA biogenesis gene SNP, was
associated with AIDS-NHL risk (OR=1.34 per minor allele; 95% CI: 1.02-1.75), and 
higher miRNA-222 serum levels nearing statistical significance (MR=1.21 per minor
allele; 95% CI: 0.98-1.49). MiRNA-196a2 rs11614913 was associated with decreased 
central nervous system (CNS) AIDS-NHL (CT vs. CC OR=0.52; 95% CI: 0.27-0.99). The
minor allele of HIF1A rs2057482, which creates a miRNA-196a2 binding site, was
associated with systemic AIDS-NHL risk (OR=1.73 per minor allele; 95% CI:
1.12-2.67), and decreased CNS AIDS-NHL risk (OR=0.49 per minor allele; 95% CI:
0.25-0.94).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a few miRNA-SNPs are associated with
AIDS-NHL risk and may modulate miRNA expression. These results support a role for
miRNA in AIDS-NHL and may highlight pathways to be targeted for risk
stratification or therapeutics.
