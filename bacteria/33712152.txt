Chitin-encapsulated cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS@CTN QDs) were successfully 
synthesized from chitin and Cd(NO3)2 precursor using the colloidal chemistry
method, toward the development of biocompatible and biodegradable QDs for
biomedical applications. CdS@CTN QDs exhibited the nanocrystalline cubic CdS
encapsulated by α-chitin. The average particle size of CdS@CTN QDs was estimated 
using empirical Henglein model to be 3.9 nm, while their crystallite size was
predicted using Scherrer equation to be 4.3 nm, slightly larger compared to
3-mercaptopropionic acid-capped CdS QDs (3.2 and 3.6 nm, respectively). The
mechanism of formation was interpreted based on the spectroscopic data and X-ray 
crystal structures of CdS@CTN QDs fabricated at different pH values and mass
ratios of chitin to Cd(NO3)2 precursor. As an important step to explore potential
biomolecular and biological applications of CdS@CTN QDs, their antibacterial
activities were tested against four different bacterial strains; i.e. Escherichia
coli, Bacillus subtillus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
