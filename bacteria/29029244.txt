Macrophages are specialized phagocytic cells involved in clearing invading
pathogens. Previously we reported that engulfment and cell motility protein 1
(ELMO1) in macrophages mediates bacterial internalization and intestinal
inflammation. Here we studied the role of ELMO1 in the fate of internalized
targets. ELMO1 is present in the intracellular vesicles and enhances accumulation
of the protein LC3B following engulfment of Salmonella or treatment with
autophagy-inducing rapamycin. The protein ATG5 and the kinase ULK1 are involved
in classical autophagy, while LC3-associated phagocytosis is ULK1 independent.
ATG5 but not ULK1 cooperated with ELMO1 in LC3 accumulation after infection,
suggesting the ELMO1 preferentially regulated LC3-associated phagocytosis.
Because LC3-associated phagocytosis delivers cargo for degradation, the
contribution of ELMO1 to the lysosome degradation pathways was evaluated by
studying pH and cathepsin B activity. ELMO1-depleted macrophages showed a
time-dependent increase in pH and a decrease in cathepsin B activity associated
with bacterial survival. Together, ELMO1 regulates LC3B accumulation and
antimicrobial responses involved in the clearance of enteric pathogens. This
paper investigated how innate immune pathways involving ELMO1 work in a
coordinated fashion to eliminate bacterial threats. ELMO1 is present in the
phagosome and enhances bacterial clearance by differential regulation of
lysosomal acidification and enzymatic activity.
