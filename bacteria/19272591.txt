The glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (GITR) protein is a member of the tumor
necrosis factor receptor superfamily influencing natural and acquired immune
response. GITR is activated by its ligand, GITRL, mainly expressed on antigen
presenting cells. Previously, we demonstrated that GITR plays a role in
regulating immune response to Candida albicans. Here we analyzed whether
GITRL-GITR interaction influences the recognition of C. albicans by regulating
the expression of pattern recognition receptors on splenic dendritic cells. Our
report demonstrates that under physiological conditions and during candidiasis
the GITRL-GITR system affects TLR-2 and TLR-4 expression on DC. These changes
correlate with decrease in: MyD88 activation; CD80 and CD40 expression on DC; T
cell activation response, including CD28 expression, IL-2 and IFN-gamma
production. Our results point out that, during fungal infection, GITRL-GITR
interaction modulates TLR-4 and TLR-2 expression, thereby altering the antigen
presentation process, and suggesting a role of GITRL-GITR interaction in
resistance against infectious diseases.
