The authors describe the first two cases, to their knowledge, of retinal
vasculitis, associated with Q fever. The first case was a chronic infection
induced by Coxiella burnetii associated with HLA group A29 and B12; in the second
case, the phenotype was B12. The authors tried to determine whether this agent
could be the "Birdshot chorioretinopathy" promoting factor. Several epidemiologic
findings tend to prove that Q fever is not the only cause. On the other hand, its
similarity with rickettsia, the fact that it is found in patients with
vasculitis, suggest that it could be one of the initial causal factors.
