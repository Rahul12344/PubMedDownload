Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a ubiquitous rare mesenchymal neoplasm. Pleura is
the favored site of origin and is rare in the oral cavity. SFT occurs across a
wide histopathologic spectrum. Fibrous form characterized by hyalinized,
thick-walled vessels with opened lumina and strong CD34 reactivity constitute one
end and on the other end, a cellular form representing the conventional
hemangiopericytoma, with branched, thin-walled vessels and focal or negative CD34
reactivity characterize the spectrum. A case of oral SFT in a 30-year-old female 
patient with its clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features is 
being presented here.
