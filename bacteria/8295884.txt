with infiltrative pulmonary tuberculosis].

150 patients with infiltrative tuberculosis (IT) and 135 healthy subjects were
subjected to HLA-typing. Clinico-immunogenetic correlations provided evidence for
significantly higher incidence of antigens A11, B12, Cw2, DR2, DR5 in IT patients
versus healthy subjects. Antigens Cw3 and DR2 occur more frequently in
progressive disease. IT patients disseminating M. tuberculosis carry more
frequently antigens HLA-DR2, those with L-forms DR5, with antigenemia antigens
HLA-DR2 and DR4.
