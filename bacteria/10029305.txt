Through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using degenerate
oligonucleotide primers, a VCP homolog was identified in African trypanosomes.
Sequence analysis shows a 72 and 64% deduced amino acid identity, respectively,
with mouse VCP and yeast Cdc48p. Southern analysis indicates tbVCP to have a
single locus with two alleles. Antibodies generated against recombinant protein
recognize a 95 kDa protein in whole cell lysates of both procyclic and
bloodstream trypanosomes. There is an approximately four-fold greater expression 
of TbVCP protein in the procyclic stage of the trypanosome life cycle.
Subcellular fractionation and immunofluorescence with anti-TbVCP antibodies
indicate the majority of TbVCP to be cytoplasmically localized with a small
subset associated with membranes. Sucrose velocity sedimentation and gel
filtration size analysis studies suggest that TbVCP is a homohexameric particle
as has been demonstrated with other VCP homologs. Also like other VCP homologs,
TbVCP contains an NEM-inhibitable ATPase activity. This is the first
characterization of an AAA (ATPases Associated with a variety of cellular
Activities) family member in African trypanosomes.
