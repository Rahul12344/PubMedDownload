CODAS syndrome is a multi-system developmental disorder characterized by
cerebral, ocular, dental, auricular, and skeletal anomalies. Using whole-exome
and Sanger sequencing, we identified four LONP1 mutations inherited as homozygous
or compound-heterozygous combinations among ten individuals with CODAS syndrome. 
The individuals come from three different ancestral backgrounds (Amish-Swiss from
United States, n = 8; Mennonite-German from Canada, n = 1; mixed European from
Canada, n = 1). LONP1 encodes Lon protease, a homohexameric enzyme that mediates 
protein quality control, respiratory-complex assembly, gene expression, and
stress responses in mitochondria. All four pathogenic amino acid substitutions
cluster within the AAA(+) domain at residues near the ATP-binding pocket. In
biochemical assays, pathogenic Lon proteins show substrate-specific defects in
ATP-dependent proteolysis. When expressed recombinantly in cells, all altered Lon
proteins localize to mitochondria. The Old Order Amish Lon variant (LONP1
c.2161C>G[p.Arg721Gly]) homo-oligomerizes poorly in vitro. Lymphoblastoid cell
lines generated from affected children have (1) swollen mitochondria with
electron-dense inclusions and abnormal inner-membrane morphology; (2) aggregated 
MT-CO2, the mtDNA-encoded subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase; and (3) reduced
spare respiratory capacity, leading to impaired mitochondrial proteostasis and
function. CODAS syndrome is a distinct, autosomal-recessive, developmental
disorder associated with dysfunction of the mitochondrial Lon protease.
