The primary objective of this study was to determine the role of β2 integrin
α-subunit (CD11b) in the mechanism of human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PML)
priming by S or Re endotoxin glycoforms from Escherichia coli for fMLP-induced
respiratory burst. Similar priming activity of S and Re endotoxin glycoforms for 
fMLP-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation from primed PML was found. 
Anti-CD11b antibodies (clone ICRF 44) as well as isotype-matched immunoglobulin
G1 (clone MOPC-21) do not influence the fMLP-induced ROS generation from unprimed
PML. Antibodies against CD11b do not change fMLP-induced ROS generation from
endotoxin-primed PML as well. The involvement of different isoforms of Fcγ
receptors in fMLP-induced ROS generation from activated PML is proposed.
