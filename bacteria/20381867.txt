The tyrosine kinase Pyk2 integrates receptor-mediated signals controlling actin
cytoskeletal rearrangement, events needed for the activation and function of T
cells. Induction of the T cell receptor (TCR) leads to the phosphorylation of
Pyk2, but the timing of these events is controversial and not fully understood.
In this study, the TCR-induced phosphorylation kinetics of Pyk2 tyrosines 402 and
580 were characterized in human T cells. Interestingly, the early TCR-mediated
phosphorylation of Pyk2 was more rapid and transient than ZAP-70, whose
phosphorylation kinetics were similar to other T cell signaling proteins.
Unexpectedly, Pyk2 had a second burst of phosphorylation 30-60 min after TCR
stimulation. Pyk2 was enzymatically active during the two separate bursts of
phosphorylation, since both paxillin phosphorylation, a known substrate of Pyk2, 
and TCR-induced actin polymerization showed similar kinetics. The second burst of
Pyk2 phosphorylation did not require actin cytoskeleton rearrangement or PI3K
function, but was dependent on the enzymatic activity of Fyn and/or Lck.
Collectively, these observations suggest that signaling pathways downstream of
TCR activation are hard-wired to induce two separate periods of Pyk2 activation
and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement.
