The v-ets oncogene family shares a conserved peptide motif called the ETS domain 
that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. This motif is unique among
transcription factor families. Using partially degenerate oligonucleotides from
conserved regions of the ETS domain and the polymerase chain reaction, we
isolated a new member of the v-ets family designated PE-1 from HL60 cells. PE-1
was expressed as an approximately 7.5-kb transcript in most cell lines tested. In
the hairy cell leukemia line Eskol, there was an additional 1.8-kb transcript
observed. PE-1 was the most common ETS domain gene found in CD34+HLA-DR-
hematopoietic progenitors. PE-1 was localized to human chromosome 1q21-q23 using 
both in situ chromosomal hybridization and human-hamster hybrids.
