Leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is a diagnostic marker candidate for
glioblastoma. Although LRG1 has been associated with angiogenesis, it has been
suggested that its biomarker role differs depending on the type of tumor. In this
study, a clinicopathological examination of LRG1's role as a biomarker for
glioblastoma was performed. We used tumor tissues of 155 cases with diffuse
gliomas (27 astrocytomas, 14 oligodendrogliomas, 114 glioblastomas). The
immunohistochemical LRG1 intensity scoring was classified into 2 groups: low
expression and high expression. Mutations of IDH1, IDH2, and TERT promoter were
analyzed through the Sanger method. We examined the relationship between LRG1
expression level in glioblastoma and clinical parameters, such as age,
preoperative Karnofsky performance status, tumor location, extent of resection,
O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter, and prognosis. LRG1 high
expression rate was 41.2% in glioblastoma, 3.7% in astrocytoma, and 21.4% in
oligodendroglioma. Glioblastoma showed a significantly higher LRG1 expression
than lower-grade glioma (p = 0.0003). High expression of LRG1 was an independent 
favorable prognostic factor (p = 0.019) in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma and
correlated with gross total resection (p = 0.002) and the tumor location on
nonsubventricular zone (p = 0.00007). LRG1 demonstrated multiple potential as a
diagnostic, prognostic, and regional biomarker for glioblastoma.
