Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) can induce severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. We
performed HLA genotyping and lymphocyte activation tests (LATs) for five
AED-induced SCAR patients (three males and two females; aged 40-66 years old).
Three patients were treated with carbamazepine (CBZ) for pain control, one was
treated with phenytoin (PHT) for seizure prevention, and one was treated with
valproic acid (VPA) for seizure prevention. One patient was diagnosed with
CBZ-induced DRESS syndrome and the remaining patients were diagnosed with SJS.
All patients recovered from SCARs after stopping suspicious drugs and supportive 
care. LATs were conducted to confirm the culprit drug responsible for inducing
SCARs; and LAT results were positive for the suspected culprit drugs, in all
except in one case. HLA-A, -B, and -C alleles were determined using
PCR-sequence-based typing method. The common alleles of HLA were -A*02:01,
-B*51:01, and -C*03:04 which were carried by three patients (60%) for each
allele. The patient with CBZ-induced DRESS syndrome carried the HLA-A* 31:01
allele. One patient with CBZ-induced SJS and one patient with VPA-induced SJS
carried the HLA-B*15:11 allele. No patients carried the HLA-B*15:02 allele, which
is a known risk allele of AED-induced SCARs. Further investigation of the three
common alleles found in the five AED-induced SCARs patients is needed. We
demonstrated the usefulness of LAT for confirming the culprit drug.
