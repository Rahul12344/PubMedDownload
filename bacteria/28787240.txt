The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biological effects associated with 
administering strontium chloride as a marking agent to age-0 Chinook Salmon
Oncorhynchus tshawytscha fry. Fish were held in a 0× (0 mg/L), 1× (3,000 mg/L;
current standard dosage), 3× (9,000 mg/L), or 5× (15,000 mg/L) solution of
strontium chloride for 72 h (three times the standard duration of 24 h). The
mortality among fish in the 5× strontium chloride exposure group was
significantly higher than that observed in the other groups. A dose-related
effect on general fish behavior and on feeding behavior was observed. Fish in all
test tanks appeared to feed to satiation, except for fish in the 5× tanks during 
days 2 and 3. Fish in all other test tanks behaved normally. No dose-related
effect on fish growth was detected. Histopathological evaluations showed that
fish in the 5× exposure group had a significantly higher number of gill lesions
than the 0× group. Our mortality, behavioral, and histological assessments
suggested that juvenile Chinook Salmon could be safely immersed for three
consecutive days in a 9,000-mg/L solution of strontium chloride. This finding
potentially expands the present 1,000-3,000-mg/L dosage and 24-h holding period
that can be used to mark juvenile fish with strontium chloride solutions. The
research also provides necessary target animal safety data for U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval of strontium chloride as an alternative marking method
that is suitable for fish with a short holding time. Received February 19, 2017; 
accepted July 16, 2017.
