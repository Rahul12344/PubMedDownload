Background: KIT is a protooncogene that encodes for the KIT oncoprotein, which is
a transmembrane tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor that holds a critical role
in a variety of normal physiological and pathological processes including
angiogenesis. KIT has been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis, contributing to
the development of gastrointestinal carcinoma and leukemia. A link between KIT
overexpression and breast cancer development has previously been reported. In the
current study, we explored KIT gene expression and exonic copy number variants
(CNV) and the relationship with angiogenesis (CD34) and the clinicopathological
features of breast cancer.
Methods: MLPA technique was used to determine the CNV in 64 breast cancer tumor
samples from patients diagnosed with primary sporadic breast cancer. Results were
confirmed by quantitative PCR. Expression of KIT and CD34 was determined using
immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Results: Our results show that 28.1% of the tumor samples from patients with
primary sporadic breast cancer had CNV in the KIT gene. Among the breast tumor
samples, 54.7% showed positive KIT expression. The expression of the CD34
angiogenesis marker was reported in 43.8% of the tumor samples as low, 42.2% as
moderate and 14.1% as high. A significant correlation between increased CNV of
KIT exons, a high level of angiogenesis (CD34) and increased tumor grade was
observed (p< 0.05).
Conclusion: A significant correlation between the KIT CNV and the angiogenesis
marker was found. Examining KIT expression and CNV has the potential to function 
as a biomarker for tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs in breast cancer.
