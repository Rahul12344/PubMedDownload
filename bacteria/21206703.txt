AIM: Distribution of HLA class I and II alleles and haplotype was studied in
Pakistani population and compared with the data reported for Caucasoid, Africans,
Orientals and Arab populations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: HLA class I and II polymorphisms in 1000 unrelated
Pakistani individuals was studied using sequence-specific primers and polymerase 
chain reaction and assay.
RESULTS: The most frequent class I alleles observed were A*02, B*35 and CW*07,
with frequencies of 19.2, 13.7 and 20%, respectively. Fifteen distinct HLA-DRB1
alleles and eight HLA-DQB1 alleles were recognized. The most frequently observed 
DRB1 alleles which represented more than 60% of the subjects were DRB1 *03, *07, 
*11 and *15. The rare DRB1 alleles detected in this study were HLADRB1 *08 and
*09, having frequencies of 0.9 and 1.7%, respectively. In addition, at DRB1-DQB1 
loci there were 179 different haplotypes and 285 unique genotypes and the most
common haplotype was DRB1*15-DQB1*06 which represented 17% of the total DRB1-DQB1
haplotypes. In our population, haplotype A*33-B*58-Cw*03 comprised 2.8% of the
total class I haplotypes observed. This haplotype was seen only in the oriental
populations and has not been reported in the African or European Caucasoid.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed a close similarity of HLA class I and II alleles
with that of European Caucasoid and Orientals. In Pakistani population, two rare 
loci and three haplotypes were identified, whereas haplotypes characteristic of
Caucasians, Africans and Orientals were also found, suggesting an admixture of
different races due to migration to and from this region.
