[The enzymatic degradation of DDT. 1. Main degradation pathways].

[Article in German]

Kujawa M, Macholz RM, Engst R.

First investigations on the degradation of DDT were already carried out at the
beginning of its application. Its metabolism, however, is not yet absolutely
clear till now. Main degradation pathways are considered: Reductive
dechlorinations, successive dehydrochlorinations to unsaturated compounds as well
as oxidations to aldehydes, alcohol and carboxylic acid. Decarboxylations of
carboxylic acids are considered to be dependent on the species concerned. Between
various organisms only quantitative differences are evident.
