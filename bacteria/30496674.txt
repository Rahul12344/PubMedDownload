New Fluvirucinins C1 and C2 Produced by a Marine Derived Actinomycete.

Costa M, Zúñiga P, Peñalver AM, Thorsteinsdottir M, Pérez M, Cañedo LM, Cuevas C.

Two new fluvirucin aglycones, named fluvirucinins C, and C2 (1-2), have been
isolated from the ethyl acetate mycelial cake extract of the fermentation broth
of.a marine sponge-associated actinomycete. Fluvirucinins C, (1) and C2 (2)
represent a new type of 14-membered macrolactam aglycon, structurally related
with the common aglycon of the known fluvirucins. Their structures were
elucidated on the basis of ID and 2D NMR analyses, as well as HRESIMS
experiments. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of compounds 1 and 2 have
been evaluated, but no significant activities found for fluvirucinins C, and C2.
