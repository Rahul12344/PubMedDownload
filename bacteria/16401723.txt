The anthrax toxin is composed of three independent polypeptide chains. Successful
intoxication only occurs when heptamerization of the receptor-binding
polypeptide, the protective antigen (PA), allows binding of the two enzymatic
subunits before endocytosis. We show that this tailored behavior is caused by two
counteracting posttranslational modifications in the cytoplasmic tail of PA
receptors. The receptor is palmitoylated, and this unexpectedly prevents its
association with lipid rafts and, thus, its premature ubiquitination. This second
modification, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, only occurs in
rafts and is required for rapid endocytosis of the receptor. As a consequence,
cells expressing palmitoylation-defective mutant receptors are less sensitive to 
anthrax toxin because of a lower number of surface receptors as well as premature
internalization of PA without a requirement for heptamerization.
