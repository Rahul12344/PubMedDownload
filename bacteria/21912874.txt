Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyzes the reversible transfer
of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) to form
dephospho-CoA (dPCoA) and pyrophosphate in the Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic
pathway. Importantly, PPATs are the potential target for developing antibiotics
because bacterial and mammalian PPATs share little sequence homology. Previous
structural studies revealed the mechanism of the recognizing substrates and
products. The binding modes of ATP, ADP, Ppant, and dPCoA are highly similar in
all known structures, whereas the binding modes of CoA or 3'-phosphoadenosine
5'-phosphosulfate binding are novel. To provide further structural information on
ligand binding by PPATs, the crystal structure of PPAT from Enterococcus faecalis
was solved in three forms: (i) apo form, (ii) binary complex with ATP, and (iii) 
binary complex with pantetheine. The substrate analog, pantetheine, binds to the 
active site in a similar manner to Ppant. The new structural information reported
in this study including pantetheine as a potent inhibitor of PPAT will supplement
the existing structural data and should be useful for structure-based
antibacterial discovery against PPATs.
