The aim of this study was to evaluate whether Trypanosma cruzi infections cause
alterations in the levels of seric purines, which could contribute to host
immunomodulation. Twelve mice were divided into two groups identified as control 
(uninfected) and infected (T. cruzi) groups. The influence of the disease on
seric purine levels was verified on day 20 post-infection (PI) by HPLC. Infected 
mice had circulating trypomastigotes during the experiment, as well as amastigote
forms in the heart associated with inflammatory infiltrates. Increases on
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), adenosine (ADO),
inosine (INO), and uric acid (URIC) levels were observed in the infected animals,
while the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and xanthine (XAN) levels were reduced
compared with mice of the control group, indicating a possible impairment on the 
purinergic system, and consequently, on the immune system during the clinical
course of the disease. In summary, the T. cruzi infection alters the seric purine
levels, and consequently, modulates the immune system.
