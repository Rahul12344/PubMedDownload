beta-Defensins are mammalian antimicrobial peptides that share a unique
disulfide-bonding motif of six conserved cysteines. An intragenic polymorphism of
the DEFB1 gene that changes a highly conserved Cys to Ser in the peptide coding
region has recently been described. The deduced peptide cannot form three
disulfide bonds, as one of the cysteines is unpaired. We have determined the
cysteine connectivities of a corresponding synthetic hBD-1(Ser35) peptide,
investigated the structure by circular dichroism spectroscopy, and assayed the in
vitro antimicrobial activity. Despite a different arrangement of the disulfides, 
hBD-1(Ser35) proved as active as hBD-1 against the microorganisms tested. This
activity likely depends on the ability of hBD-1(Ser35) to adopt an amphipathic
conformation in hydrophobic environment, similar to the wild type peptide, as
suggested by CD spectroscopy.
