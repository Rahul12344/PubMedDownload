Photocatalysis provides a "green" and effective strategy for water disinfection. 
During the photocatalytic disinfection process, intracellular organic matter
(IOM) from bacterial cells may be released into the bulk solution. In this study,
the role of released IOM in the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation was
investigated by fractionation procedure and fluorescence
excitation-emission-matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC)
approaches. The normal bacterial cells treated by TiO2-UVA in the presence and
absence with fractionated IOM results implied that the released IOM would be
either absorbed on the surface of the photocatalysts or reacted by the
photo-generated reactive species, and thereby affecting the kinetics of
photocatalytic bacterial inactivation. Fluorescence EEM-PARAFAC results showed
that two components (C1 and C3) associated with tryptophan- and tyrosine-like
proteins were released. While another two components (C2 and C4) were the
oxidation products, and their intensities were found to negatively correlate with
those of C1 and C3, respectively. Microtox® test results indicated that toxicity 
occurred during the photocatalytic bacterial inactivation process. The toxicity
was found to decrease after the bacteria were completely inactivated, and
completely removed if provided a sufficient reaction time. Of particular interest
is that a significant high linear correlation was observed between the toxicity
and the maximum fluorescence intensity of C4. The results and information
obtained in this study will be important for further developing photocatalysis in
water/wastewater disinfection.
