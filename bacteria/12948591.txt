A new type of planar lipid substrate for Humicola lanuginosa lipase (HLL) has
been prepared by depositing a monolayer of 1-mono-oleoyl-rac-glycerol (MOG) on
top of a monolayer of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) on mica by the
Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The bilayer was subsequently exposed to HLL in 
a liquid cell of an atomic force microscope (AFM) allowing the time course of the
lipolytic degradation to be observed. By analysing a series of AFM images, we
find that enzymes are preferentially activated at the edge of nano-scale defects 
present in the bilayer prior to enzyme injection, while defect-free areas of the 
substrate are surprisingly stable towards enzyme degradation. The initial rate of
hydrolysis is found to be proportional to the perimeter length, P, of the initial
nano-scale defects as well as the bulk enzyme concentration, c(HLL);
d(lipid)/dt=k P c(HLL). We estimate the specific rate of MOG hydrolysis by HLL to
be 2.5x10(4) MOG molecules/(minute x molecule of HLL).
