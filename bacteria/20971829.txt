RATIONALE: The reduction of neutrophil migration to the bacterial focus is
associated with poor outcome in sepsis.
OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify soluble substances in the
blood of septic mice that inhibit neutrophil migration.
METHODS: A pool of serum obtained from mice 2 hours after the induction of severe
sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture inhibited the neutrophil migration. The
proteins with inhibitory activity on neutrophil migration were isolated by
Blue-Sepharose chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and
electrophoresis, and identified by mass spectrometry.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hemopexin was identified as the serum component
responsible for the inhibition of neutrophil migration. In sepsis, the
pretreatment of wild-type mice with hemopexin inhibited neutrophil migration to
the focus of infection and decreased the survival rate from 87.5 to 50.0%.
Hemopexin-null mice subjected to severe sepsis presented normal neutrophil
migration, low bacteremia, and an improvement of 40% in survival rate. Moreover, 
hemopexin inhibited the neutrophil chemotaxis response evoked by C5a or
macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and induced a reduction of CXCR2 and L-selectin
as well as the up-regulation of CD11b expression in neutrophil membranes. The
inhibitory effect of hemopexin on neutrophil chemotaxis was prevented by serine
protease inhibitors or ATP. In addition, serum levels of ATP were decreased 2
hours after severe sepsis.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate for the first time the inhibitory role of
hemopexin in neutrophil migration during sepsis and suggest that the therapeutic 
inhibition of hemopexin or its protease activity could improve neutrophil
migration to the focus of infection and survival in sepsis.
