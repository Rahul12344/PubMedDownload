This study aims to demonstrate the antibiotic resistance and its association with
disinfectant and heavy metal resistance in 152 Salmonella isolates recovered from
retail foods of animal origins. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that 92.8%
isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, and the resistance was
highest to oxytetracycline (80.9%), followed by trimethoprim (64.5%), amoxicillin
(28.9%), ampicillin (28.3%), levofloxacin (21.7%), ciprofloxacin (16.4%), and
gentamicin (10.5%), respectively. The blaTEM and tetA genes (44.7%) were commonly
present. The qacF and qacEΔ1 genes were detected in 18.4% and 8.6% of all
isolates. The Cu-resistance genes pcoR, pcoC, and pcoA were the most prevalent
(20.4-40.8%), followed by Hg-resistance gene merA (17.8%) and As-resistance genes
arsB (6.6%). The antibiotic resistance was highly associated with disinfectant or
certain heavy metal resistance genes. Most notably, the association among
Cu-resistance genes (pcoC, pcoR), disinfectant resistance genes (qacF, qacEΔ1),
and tetracycline and sulfonamide resistance genes (tet, sul) was significant
(p < 0.05). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed that Salmonella isolates
was associated with supermarkets indicating the possibility of crosscontamination
in farms or processing environment. This study indicated that retail meats may be
a reservoir for the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella and using
disinfectants for decontamination or metals in livestock may provide a pressure
for coselecting strains with acquired resistance to other antimicrobials.
