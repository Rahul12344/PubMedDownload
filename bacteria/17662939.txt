The tyrosine kinase Met, the product of the c-met proto-oncogene and the receptor
for hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), mediates signals critical
for cell survival and migration. The human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes
exploits Met signaling for invasion of host cells via its surface protein InlB.
We present the crystal structure of the complex between a large fragment of the
human Met ectodomain and the Met-binding domain of InlB. The concave face of the 
InlB leucine-rich repeat region interacts tightly with the first
immunoglobulin-like domain of the Met stalk, a domain which does not bind HGF/SF.
A second contact between InlB and the Met Sema domain locks the otherwise
flexible receptor in a rigid, signaling competent conformation. Full Met
activation requires the additional C-terminal domains of InlB which induce
heparin-mediated receptor clustering and potent signaling. Thus, although it
elicits a similar cellular response, InlB is not a structural mimic of HGF/SF.
