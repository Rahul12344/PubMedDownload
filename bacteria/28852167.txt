A large majority of genome-encrypted chemical diversity in actinobacteria remains
to be discovered, which is related to the low level of secondary metabolism genes
expression. Here, we report the application of a reporter-guided screening
strategy to activate cryptic polycyclic tetramate macrolactam gene clusters in
Streptomyces albus J1074. The analysis of the S. albus transcriptome revealed an 
overall low level of secondary metabolism genes transcription. Combined with
transposon mutagenesis, reporter-guided screening resulted in the selection of
two S. albus strains with altered secondary metabolites production. Transposon
insertion in the most prominent strain, S. albus ATGSal2P2::TN14, was mapped to
the XNR_3174 gene encoding an unclassified transcriptional regulator. The mutant 
strain was found to produce the avenolide-like compound butenolide 4. The
deletion of the gene encoding a putative acyl-CoA oxidase, an orthologue of the
Streptomyces avermitilis avenolide biosynthesis enzyme, in the S. albus XNR_3174 
mutant caused silencing of secondary metabolism. The homologues of XNR_3174 and
the butenolide biosynthesis genes were found in the genomes of multiple
Streptomyces species. This result leads us to believe that the discovered
regulatory elements comprise a new condition-dependent system that controls
secondary metabolism in actinobacteria and can be manipulated to activate cryptic
biosynthetic pathways.
