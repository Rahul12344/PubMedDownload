Intestinal Paneth cells limit bacterial invasion by secreting antimicrobial
proteins, including lysozyme. However, invasive pathogens can disrupt the Golgi
apparatus, interfering with secretion and compromising intestinal antimicrobial
defense. Here we show that during bacterial infection, lysozyme is rerouted via
secretory autophagy, an autophagy-based alternative secretion pathway. Secretory 
autophagy was triggered in Paneth cells by bacteria-induced endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress, required extrinsic signals from innate lymphoid cells, and limited
bacterial dissemination. Secretory autophagy was disrupted in Paneth cells of
mice harboring a mutation in autophagy gene Atg16L1 that confers increased risk
for Crohn's disease in humans. Our findings identify a role for secretory
autophagy in intestinal defense and suggest why Crohn's disease is associated
with genetic mutations that affect both the ER stress response and autophagy.
