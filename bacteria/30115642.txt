T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) mediate both
antitumor immunity (graft-versus-leukemia [GVL]) and graft-versus-host disease
(GVHD) in allogeneic stem cell transplant. Identifying mHAs with high allele
frequency, tight binding affinity to common HLA molecules, and narrow tissue
restriction could enhance immunotherapy against leukemia. Genotyping and HLA
allele data from 101 HLA-matched donor-recipient pairs (DRPs) were
computationally analyzed to predict both class I and class II mHAs likely to
induce either GVL or GVHD. Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted in
HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared with
HLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater genetic
disparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted 14 of 18 previously
identified mHAs, with 2 minor antigen mismatches not being contained in the
patient cohort, 1 missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of the
peptide antigen, and 1 case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptide
epitope derived from GRK4, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and
testis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandem
mass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK4-V were identified by tetramer
analysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPs
where the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK4-V, suggesting that this
antigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen. Computational analysis 
of genomic and transcriptomic data can reliably predict leukemia-associated mHA
and can be used to guide targeted mHA discovery.
