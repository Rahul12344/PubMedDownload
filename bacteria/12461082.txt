Previous studies in mice and humans have suggested an important role for CD8+ T
cells in host defense to Mtb. Recently, we have described human, Mtb-specific
CD8+ cells that are neither HLA-A, B, or C nor group 1 CD1 restricted, and have
found that these cells comprise the dominant CD8+ T cell response in latently
infected individuals. In this report, three independent methods are used to
demonstrate the ability of these cells to recognize Mtb-derived antigen in the
context of the monomorphic HLA-E molecule. This is the first demonstration of the
ability of HLA-E to present pathogen-derived antigen. Further definition of the
HLA-E specific response may aid development of an effective vaccine against
tuberculosis.
