The production and purification of recombinant proteins from E. coli expression
systems is often complicated by the fact that a significant amount of the foreign
protein is deposited in the cytoplasm of the bacteria as aggregates or inclusion 
bodies. Many non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases are typical examples of
proteins that are poorly soluble when overproduced in E. coli. Here, we report on
the engineering of bacterial strains which overproduce chaperone proteins of the 
Hsp70 (DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE) and Hsp60 (GroEL and GroES) families. The
simultaneous overproduction in E. coli of the chaperones DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE on
the one hand, or GroEL and GroES on the other hand, and the human non-receptor
protein tyrosine kinases Csk, Fyn or Lck resulted in increased solubility of the 
recombinant kinases. This provides the basis for future successful production and
purification of large quantities of soluble and active non-receptor protein
tyrosine kinases from E.coli expression systems and will enable the further
characterization of these important enzyme families at the molecular level.
