AIMS: To determine the profile of volatile compounds responsible for the aroma of
Soumbala produced spontaneously and with pure and mixed cultures of Bacillus
subtilis and Bacillus pumilus.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Traditional and controlled fermentation trials of African
locust bean with pure and mixed starter cultures of B. subtilis (B7, B9 and B15) 
and B. pumilus (B10) were performed. Aroma volatiles were analysed using
Likens-Nikerson method coupled with gas chromatography and mass
spectrophotometry. Sensory analysis of Soumbala as well as rice dishes prepared
with each type of Soumbala were carried out by 10 panellists. In total 116
compounds were identified. They included pyrazines, aldehydes, ketones, esters,
alcohols, acids, alkanes, alkenes, amines, pyridines, benzenes, phenols,
sulphurs, furans and other compounds. Using principal component analysis for
comparison, the aroma profiles of the Soumbala samples could be separated into
three groups. The sensory evaluation showed variable acceptability. However, it
was noticed that Soumbala samples produced with starter cultures were scored
higher than traditionally prepared Soumbala.
CONCLUSIONS: Aroma volatiles and organoleptic properties of Soumbala vary
according to the Bacillus isolates involved in the fermentation.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study contributes to the selection of 
Bacillus starter cultures for controlled production of Soumbala.
