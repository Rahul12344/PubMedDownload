BACKGROUND: Based on their essential role in concerting immunological and
inflammatory responses we hypothesized that the homeostatic chemokines CCL19 and 
CCL21 may play a pathogenic role in rickettsiae infection.
METHODS: Serum levels of CCL19 and CCL21 in patients with R. africae and R.
conorii infection were analyzed by enzyme immunoassays. Lungs from R. conorii
infected mice were examined for CCL19, CCL21 and CCR7 expression by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: We found that patients with R. africae infection (n = 15) and in
particular those with R. conorii infection (n = 16) had elevated serum levels of 
CCL19 on admission, with a decline during follow-up. While a similar pattern was 
seen for CCL21 in R. africae infection, patients with R. conorii infection showed
persistently increased CCL21 levels during follow-up. In experimental R. conorii 
infection, we found strong immunostaining of CCL19 and CCL21 in the lungs,
particularly in individuals that had received lethal doses. Immunofluorescence
showed co-localization of CCR7 to endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts 
within the lung tissue of R. conorii infected mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the CCL19/CCL21/CCR7 axis is up-regulated 
during R. africae and in particular during R. conorii infection, which may
potentially contribute to the pathogenesis of these disorders.
