To evaluate the contribution of the major histocompatibility complex class I
pockets to the binding of self-peptides recognized by alloreactive cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones, we have constructed an extensive library of HLA-A2
mutants with different amino acid substitutions in each of the six pockets. When 
these mutants were tested in cytotoxicity assays with a panel of HLA-A2-specific 
alloreactive CTL clones, each CTL clone showed a unique pattern of reactivity,
implying the different contributions of each pocket to binding individual
peptides. We noted that the majority of the mutants in pocket B significantly
affect recognition by the CTL clones. Unexpectedly, the mutations influencing
allorecognition are found in all other pockets as well. Overall, this study
demonstrates that each of the six peptide-binding pockets plays an important and 
distinct role in binding of self-peptides required for recognition of the HLA-A2 
molecule by alloreactive CTLs.
