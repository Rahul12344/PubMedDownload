Bacterial surface structures such as capsules and adhesins are generally regarded
as important virulence factors. Here we demonstrate that capsules block the
function of the self-recognizing protein antigen 43 through physical shielding.
The phenomenon is not restricted to Escherichia coli but can occur in other
gram-negative bacteria. Likewise, we show that other short adhesins exemplified
by the AIDA-I protein are blocked by the presence of a capsule. The results
support the notion that capsule polysaccharides sterically prevent
receptor-target recognition of short bacterial adhesins. This negative
interference has important biological consequences, such as affecting the ability
of bacteria to form biofilms.
