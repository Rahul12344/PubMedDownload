Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are a subclass of T cells that initiates 
the secretion of T helper 1 and 2 cytokines after recognizing CD1d protein
presented glycolipid antigens. In this Letter, we designed and synthesized a
novel series of CD1d ligand α-galactosylceramides (α-GalCers) in which the acyl
chain backbone of the lipid was incorporated with fluorine atoms. The in vivo
evaluation of immunostimulatory activities revealed that the synthesized
α-5-thio-galactopyranosyl-N-perfluorooctanoyl phytosphingosine exhibited a
remarkable potency toward selectively enhancing TH1 cytokine production with the 
IFN γ/IL-4 ratio of 9/1, while its perfluorotetradecanoyl counterpart showed TH2 
profile with an IFN γ/IL-4 ratio of 0.59/1. The analogues synthesized here would 
be used as probes to study lipid-protein interactions in α-GalCer/CD1d complexes.
