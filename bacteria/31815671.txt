Intracellular inclusions rich in alpha-synuclein are a hallmark of several
neuropathological diseases including Parkinson's disease (PD). Previously, we
reported the structure of alpha-synuclein fibrils (residues 1-121), composed of
two protofibrils that are connected via a densely-packed interface formed by
residues 50-57 (Guerrero-Ferreira, eLife 218;7:e36402). We here report two new
polymorphic atomic structures of alpha-synuclein fibrils termed polymorphs 2a and
2b, at 3.0 Å and 3.4 Å resolution, respectively. These polymorphs show a
radically different structure compared to previously reported polymorphs. The new
structures have a 10 nm fibril diameter and are composed of two protofilaments
which interact via intermolecular salt-bridges between amino acids K45, E57
(polymorph 2a) or E46 (polymorph 2b). The non-amyloid component (NAC) region of
alpha-synuclein is fully buried by previously non-described interactions with the
N-terminus. A hydrophobic cleft, the location of familial PD mutation sites, and 
the nature of the protofilament interface now invite to formulate hypotheses
about fibril formation, growth and stability.
