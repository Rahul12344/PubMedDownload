OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment for acute otitis media mainly targets bacteria 
with antibiotics, neglecting to control for mediators of inflammation. Mediators 
of inflammation, such as leukotrienes, have been identified in patients with
acute otitis media (AOM) or subsequent secretory otitis media (SOM). They can
cause functional eustachian tube dysfunction or increase mucous in the middle
ear, causing persistent SOM following AOM. The objective of the present study was
to evaluate whether or not administration of pranlukast, a widely used
leukotriene C4, D4, and E4 antagonist, together with antibiotics could inhibit
the progression to SOM.
METHODS: Children with AOM, who were from two to 12 years old, were randomly
divided into two groups as follows: a control group in which 50 patients received
antibiotic-based conventional treatment according to guidelines for treating AOM 
proposed by the Japan Otological Society (version 2006); and a pranlukast group, 
in which 52 patients were administered pranlukast for up to 28 days as well as
given conventional treatment. Cases were regarded as persistent SOM when a
tympanogram was type B or C2 four weeks after treatment was initiated.
RESULTS: Two patients in the pranlukast group and 3 patients in the control group
were excluded because they relapsed AOM within 28 days after initial treatment.
Therefore, the analysis included 50 and 47 subjects in the pranlukast and control
groups, respectively. The percentage of patients diagnosed with persistent SOM
(22.0%) was significantly smaller in the pranlukast group compared with the
control group (44.7%) (p = 0.018, chi-squared test).
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that combined treatment of AOM with antibiotics 
and a leukotriene antagonist to control inflammation is useful for preventing
progression to persistent SOM.
