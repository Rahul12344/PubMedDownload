In mice and chickens, J chain appears to be expressed only in activated B cells
and plasma cells. In humans, studies based mainly on transformed cells suggest
that J chain expression may initiate during earlier stages in B lineage
differentiation. In the present study, we isolated a series of hematopoietic
subpopulations from human fetal and adult tissues by immunofluorescence cell
sorting and examined each subpopulation for J chain expression by reverse
transcriptase-PCR. In fetal and adult bone marrow, J chain transcripts were
detected at all stages of B lineage differentiation, including the progenitor
(CD34+/CD19-) and pro-B (CD34+/CD19+) cell subpopulations. J chain mRNA was also 
detected during fetal thymocyte development: double negative (CD4-/CD8-) through 
single positive (CD4+ or CD8+) cell subpopulations. The J chain message was not
detected in peripheral CD3+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD56+ NK cells from
either fetal or adult samples. The nucleotide sequence of J chain PCR products
from CD34+/CD19- bone marrow progenitors and CD4+/CD8- thymocytes proved
identical to the previously reported sequence of functionally spliced J chain
mRNA. These results suggest that the J chain gene is transcriptionally active
during early stages of both B cell and T cell differentiation, before the
expression of their respective Ag receptors.
