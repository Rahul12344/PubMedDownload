Numerous cases and outbreaks of Salmonella infection are attributable to shell
eggs each year in the United States. Safe handling and consumption of shell eggs 
at home can help reduce foodborne illness attributable to shell eggs. A
nationally representative Web survey of 1,504 U.S. adult grocery shoppers was
conducted to describe consumer handling practices and consumption of shell eggs
at home. Based on self-reported survey data, most respondents purchase shell eggs
from a grocery store (89.5%), and these eggs were kept refrigerated (not at room 
temperature; 98.5%). As recommended, most consumers stored shell eggs in the
refrigerator (99%) for no more than 3 to 5 weeks (97.6%). After cracking eggs,
48.1% of respondents washed their hands with soap and water. More than half of
respondents who fry and/or poach eggs cooked them so that the whites and/or the
yolks were still soft or runny, a potentially unsafe practice. Among respondents 
who owned a food thermometer (62.0%), only 5.2% used it to check the doneness of 
baked egg dishes when they prepared such a dish. Consumers generally followed two
of the four core "Safe Food Families" food safety messages ("separate" and
"chill") when handling shell eggs at home. To prevent Salmonella infection
associated with shell eggs, consumers should improve their practices related to
the messages "clean" (i.e., wash hands after cracking eggs) and "cook" (i.e.,
cook until yolks and whites are firm and use a food thermometer to check doneness
of baked egg dishes) when preparing shell eggs at home. These findings will be
used to inform the development of science-based consumer education materials that
can help reduce foodborne illness from Salmonella infection.
