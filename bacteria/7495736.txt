MHC-encoded HLA-DMA and -DMB molecules are atypical MHC chains that play an
essential role in antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. They resemble
both MHC class I and II molecules but are not expressed at the cell surface. From
the study of MHC class II regulatory mutants, it was found recently that two
novel transactivators, CIITA and RFX5, are essential for the control of MHC class
II gene expression. We report here that CIITA and RFX5, although operating at
different levels of transcriptional control, are also both essential regulators
of HLA-DMA and -DMB genes. This is true for both the constitutive and the
inducible mode of DM gene expression. Indeed, both CIITA and RFX5 cDNA can
correct the HLA-DMA and -DMB gene expression defect in the respective regulatory 
mutants. The involvement of these two transcription factors accounts for the
coordinate expression of MHC class II and HLA-DM, two sets of molecules that
perform quite different functions in the overall process of antigen presentation.
