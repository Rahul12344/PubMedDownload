The incorporation of nonacetate starter units during type II polyketide
biosynthesis helps diversify natural products. Currently, there are few enzymatic
strategies for the incorporation of nonacetate starter units in type II
polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways. Here we report the crystal structure of
AuaEII, the anthranilate:CoA ligase responsible for the generation of
anthraniloyl-CoA, which is used as a starter unit by a type II PKS in aurachin
biosynthesis. We present structural and protein sequence comparisons to other
aryl:CoA ligases. We also compare the AuaEII crystal structure to a model of a
CoA ligase homologue, AuaE, which is present in the same gene cluster. AuaE is
predicted to have the same fold as AuaEII, but instead of CoA ligation, AuaE
catalyzes acyl transfer of anthranilate from anthraniloyl-CoA to the acyl carrier
protein (ACP). Together, this work provides insight into the molecular basis for 
starter unit selection of anthranilate in type II PKS biosynthesis.
