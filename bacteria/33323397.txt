Gut dysbiosis is commonly observed in patients with cirrhosis and chronic
gastrointestinal disorders, however, its effect on anti-tumor immunity in the
liver is largely unknown. Here we studied how the gut microbiome affects
anti-tumor immunity in cholangiocarcinoma. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)
or colitis, two known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma, which promote tumor
development in mice caused an accumulation of CXCR2+ polymorphonuclear
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). A decrease in gut barrier function
observed in mice with PSC and colitis allowed gut derived bacteria and
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to appear in the liver and induced CXCL1 expression in
hepatocytes through a TLR4-dependent mechanism and an accumulation of CXCR2+
PMN-MDSC. On the contrary, neomycin treatment blocked CXCL1 expression, PMN-MDSC 
accumulation and inhibited tumor growth even in the absence of liver disease or
colitis. Our study demonstrates that the gut microbiome controls hepatocytes to
form an immunosuppressive environment by increasing PMN-MDSC to promote liver
cancer.
