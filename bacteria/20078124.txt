Several peptides/small proteins and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
derivatives were synthesized and compared as substrates of sortase A (SrtA), a
bacterial transpeptidase, for enzymatic coupling. It was observed that peptides
containing the LPKTGGS and LPKTGGRS sequences as sorting signals at the peptide
C-terminus were effectively coupled to GPI derivatives having one or two glycine 
residues attached to the phosphoethanolamine group at the nonreducing end. This
reaction was employed to prepare several analogues of the human CD52 and CD24
antigens, which are naturally GPI-anchored glycopeptides/glycoproteins. It was
further observed that the trisaccharide GPI analogues 5 and 6 were better SrtA
substrates than monosaccharide GPI analogue 4, suggesting that steric hindrance
of the GPI analogues does not affect their peptidation reaction mediated by SrtA.
Therefore, this synthetic strategy may be useful for the preparation of more
complex GPI-anchored peptides, glycopeptides, proteins, and glycoproteins.
