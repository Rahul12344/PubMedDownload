Subanalysis of a pilot study (NCT01085318) assessed correlations between serum
ferritin and imaging assessments in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
patients (n = 23) receiving 44 μg interferon beta-1a subcutaneously three times
weekly. At baseline, 12, and 24 weeks, mean ferritin was 75, 127 (p < 0.001 vs
baseline), and 101 (p=0.020 vs baseline) ng/mL. No relationship between ferritin 
and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI)-filtered phase of subcortical deep gray
matter was found. Increasing ferritin correlated with decreasing lesion numbers
on both fluid attenuated inversion recovery and SWI phase at 12 weeks (r = -0.62;
p = 0.003; n = 21), and with decreasing gadolinium-enhancing lesion volume at 24 
weeks (r = -0.71; p = 0.050; n = 8).
