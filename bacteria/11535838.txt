Flow cytometry was used to study signaling events in individual CD4 T cells after
antigen recognition in the body. Phosphorylation of c-jun and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase was detected within minutes in all
antigen-specific CD4 T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues after injection of
peptide antigen into the bloodstream. The remarkable rapidity of this response
correlated with the finding that most naive T cells are in constant contact with 
dendritic antigen-presenting cells. Contrary to predictions from in vitro
experiments, antigen-induced c-jun and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
phosphorylation did not depend on CD28 signals and was insensitive to inhibition 
by cyclosporin A. Our results highlight the efficiency of the in vivo immune
response and underscore the need to verify which signaling pathways identified in
vitro actually operate under physiological conditions.
