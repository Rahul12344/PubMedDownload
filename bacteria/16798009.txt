Anthrax is caused by the gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus
anthracis. Anthrax receptors play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the
anthrax disease. Anthrax toxin receptor ATR/TEM8 VWA domain is responsible for
the binding of protective antigen (PA) of B. anthracis, and thus an attractive
target for structure-based drug therapies. However, the production of soluble and
functional ATR/TEM8 VWA domain currently requires the use of mammalian expression
systems. In this work, we expressed the ATR/TEM8 VWA domain as a fusion protein
in Escherichia coli. Recombinant ATR/TEM8 VWA domain has been purified to
homogeneity, and its identity has been verified by both N-terminal protein
microsequencing and mass spectrometry. The purified ATR/TEM8 VWA domain exhibits 
very high affinity to PA based on BIAcore assay. Moreover, like the domain
expressed in mammalian system, the bacterially expressed ATR/TEM8 VWA domain can 
block cytotoxicity induced by anthrax toxins, suggesting that the bacterially
expressed ATR/TEM8 VWA domain is properly folded and fully functional.
