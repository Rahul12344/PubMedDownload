Accumulating evidence links Fusobacterium nucleatum with ulcerative colitis (UC).
The mechanism by which F. nucleatum promotes intestinal inflammation in UC
remains poorly defined. Here, we first examined the abundance and impact of F.
nucleatum on disease activity in UC tissues. Next, we isolated a strain of F.
nucleatum from UC tissues and explored whether F. nucleatum aggravates the
intestinal inflammatory response in vitro and in vivo. We also examined whether
F. nucleatum infection involves the NF-κB or IL-17F signaling pathways. Our data 
showed that F. nucleatum was enriched in 51.78% of UC tissues and was correlated 
with the clinical course, clinical activity and refractory behavior of UC
(p < 0.05). Furthermore, we demonstrated that F. nucleatum promoted intestinal
epithelial damage and the expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, Il-6,
IL-17F and TNF-α. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum targeted caspase activation and
recruitment domain 3 (CARD3) through NOD2 to activate the IL-17F/NF-κB pathway in
vivo and in vitro. Thus, F. nucleatum orchestrates a molecular network involving 
CARD3 and IL-17F to control the UC process. Measuring and targeting F. nucleatum 
and its associated pathways will yield valuable insight into the prevention and
treatment of UC. © 2019 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.
