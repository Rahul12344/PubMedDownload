Background: Reducing the burden of malaria requires better understanding of
vector populations, particularly in forested regions where the incidence remains 
elevated. Here, we characterized malaria vectors in a locality near the Yaoundé
international airport, Cameroon, including species composition, abundance,
Plasmodium infection rate, insecticide resistance profiles and underlying
resistance mechanisms. Methods: Blood-fed adult mosquitoes resting indoors were
aspirated from houses in April 2019 at Elende, a locality situated 2 km from the 
Yaoundé-Nsimalen airport. Female mosquitoes were forced to lay eggs to generate F
1 adults. Bioassays were performed to assess resistance profile to the four
insecticides classes. The threshold of insecticide susceptibility was defined
above 98% mortality rate and mortality rates below 90% were indicative of
confirmed insecticide resistance. Furthermore, the molecular basis of resistance 
and Plasmodium infection rates were investigated. Results: Anopheles funestus
s.s. was the most abundant species in Elende (85%) followed by Anopheles gambiae 
s.s. (15%) with both having similar sporozoite rate. Both species exhibited high 
levels of resistance to the pyrethroids, permethrin and deltamethrin (<40%
mortality). An. gambiae s.s. was resistant to DDT (9.9% mortality) and bendiocarb
(54% mortality) while susceptible to organophosphate. An. funestus s.s. was
resistant to dieldrin (1% mortality), DDT (86% mortality) but susceptible to
carbamates and organophosphates. The L119F-GSTe2 resistance allele (8%) and G119S
ace-1 resistance allele (15%) were detected in An. funestus s.s. and An. gambiae 
s.s., respectively . Furthermore, the high pyrethroid/DDT resistances in An.
gambiae corresponded with an increase frequency of 1014F kdr allele (95%).
Transcriptional profiling of candidate cytochrome P450 genes reveals the
over-expression of CYP6P5, CYP6P9a and CYP6P9b. Conclusion: The resistance to
multiple insecticide classes observed in these vector populations alongside the
significant Plasmodium sporozoite rate highlights the challenges that vector
control programs encounter in sustaining the regular benefits of contemporary
insecticide-based control interventions in forested areas.
