Methodical approaches for studying of living cells in aqueous solutions by atomic
force microscopy (AFM) are demonstrated. Images of intact cyanobacteria
Synechocystis PCC 6803 in TES buffer were captured in tapping mode using
aminomodified mica as AFM substrate. Modification of freshly cleaved mica has
been done in 3-aminopropyltri-ethoxysilane vapours. The average size of
cyanobacteria was determined from AFM images. The linear size of Synechocystis
PCC 6803 in TES buffer was equal to 70 x 90 nm and their height was about 20 nm. 
Possible causes of insufficiently high resolution of the cyanobacteria AFM images
in aqueous solutions and possible ways for gaining molecular resolution in
studies of structural, functional and micromechanical properties of living cells 
are discussed.
