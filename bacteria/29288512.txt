Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease are at high risk of developing
colitis-associated cancer (CAC). Strategies to block the process from
inflammatory bowel disease to CAC should be considered. In the experiment, we aim
to explore the chemopreventive efficacy of the probiotic cocktail Bifico and its 
potential mechanism in azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulphate-induced CAC in
mice. Oral pretreatment of Bifico was adopted to evaluate its protective effect. 
The colorectums of 35 C57BL/6 mice were collected and examined for the degree of 
inflammation and tumorigenesis. Comparative 16S rRNA sequencing was carried out
to observe Bifico-target alterations in gene expression and microbiota structure.
We found that pretreatment of Bifico alleviated intestinal inflammation and
reduced tumor formation. Furthermore, we identified a subset of genes as
potential targets of Bifico treatment, including CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5, 
which are all ligands of C-X-C motif receptor 2 (CXCR2). The 16S rRNA sequencing 
showed that Bifico decreased the abundance of genera Desulfovibrio,
Mucispirillum, and Odoribacter, and a bloom of genus Lactobacillus was detected. 
Notably, we found that an abundance of these Bifico-target taxa was significantly
associated with the expression of CXCR2 ligand genes. Our studies indicate that
Bifico, given orally, can ameliorate CAC in mice through intervening with the
possible link between Desulfovibrio, Mucispirillum, Odoribacter, Lactobacillus,
and CXCR2 signaling.
