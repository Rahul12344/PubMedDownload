OBJECTIVES: There is global concern that antimicrobial resistance is a major
threat to healthcare. Antimicrobial use is a primary driver of resistance but
little information exists about the variation in antimicrobial use in individual 
hospitals in England over time or comparative use between hospitals. The
objective of this study was to collate, analyse and report issue data from
pharmacy records of 158 National Health Service (NHS) acute hospitals.
METHODS: This was a cohort study of inpatient antibacterial use in acute
hospitals in England analysed over 5 years through a data warehouse from IMS
Health, a leading provider of information, services and technology for the
healthcare industry. Around 98% of NHS hospitals were included in a country with 
a population of 50 million residents.
RESULTS: There was a dramatic change in the usage of different groups of
antibacterials between 2009 and 2013 with a marked reduction in the use of
first-generation cephalosporins by 24.7% and second-generation cephalosporins by 
41%, but little change in the use of third-generation cephalosporins (+5.7%) and 
fluoroquinolones (+1.6%). In contrast, use of co-amoxiclav, carbapenems and
piperacillin/tazobactam increased by 60.1%, 61.4% and 94.8%, respectively. There 
was wide variation in the total and relative amounts of antibacterials used
between individual hospitals.
CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal analysis of antibacterial use demonstrated remarkable
changes in NHS hospitals, probably reflecting governmental and professional
guidance to mitigate the risk of Clostridium difficile infection. The wide
variation in usage between individual hospitals suggests potential for quality
improvement and benchmarking. Quality measures of optimal hospital antimicrobial 
prescribing need urgent development and validation to support antimicrobial
stewardship initiatives.
