Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyzes the penultimate step in
the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway, reversibly transferring an adenylyl
group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine to form dephosphocoenzyme A (dPCoA). To
complement recent biochemical and structural studies on Mycobacterium
tuberculosis PPAT (MtPPAT) and to provide further insight into the feedback
regulation of MtPPAT by CoA, the X-ray crystal structure of the MtPPAT enzyme in 
complex with CoA was determined to 2.11 Ã… resolution. Unlike previous X-ray
crystal structures of PPAT-CoA complexes from other bacteria, which showed two
distinct CoA conformations bound to the active site, only one conformation of CoA
is observed in the MtPPAT-CoA complex.
