We used tapping mode atomic force microscopy to visualize the protein/protein and
the protein/DNA complexes involved in transcriptional regulation by the trp
repressor (TR). Plasmid fragments bearing the natural operators trp EDCBA and trp
R, as well as nonspecific fragments, were deposited onto mica in the presence of 
varying concentrations of TR and imaged. In the presence of L-tryptophan, both
specific and nonspecific complexes of TR with DNA are apparent, as well as free
TR assemblies directly deposited onto the mica surface. We observed the expected 
decrease in specificity of TR for its operators with increasing protein
concentration (1-5 nM). This loss of DNA-binding specificity is accompanied by
the formation of large protein assemblies of varying sizes on the mica surface,
consistent with the known tendency of the repressor to oligomerize in solution.
When the co-repressor is omitted, no repressor molecules are seen, either on the 
plasmid fragments or free on the mica surface, probably because of the formation 
of larger aggregates that are removed from the surface upon washing. All these
findings support a role for protein/protein interactions as an additional
mechanism of transcriptional regulation by the trp repressor.
