iNKT cells are CD1d-restricted T cells recognizing lipid antigens. The prototypic
iNKT cell-agonist α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) alongside compounds with
similar structures induces robust proliferation and cytokine production of iNKT
cells and protects against cancer in vivo. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that
detect CD1d-α-GalCer complexes have provided critical information for
understanding of antigen presentation of iNKT cell agonists. Although most iNKT
cell agonists with antitumor properties are α-linked glycosphingolipids that can 
be detected by anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs, β-ManCer, a glycolipid with a β-linkage, 
induces strong antitumor immunity via mechanisms distinct from those of α-GalCer.
In this study, we unexpectedly discovered that anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs directly
recognized β-ManCer-CD1d complexes and could inhibit β-ManCer stimulation of iNKT
cells. The binding of anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAb with β-ManCer-CD1d complexes was
also confirmed by plasmon resonance and could not be explained by α-anomer
contamination. The binding of anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAb was also observed with CD1d 
loaded with another β-linked glycosylceramide, β-GalCer (C26:0). Detection with
anti-CD1d-α-GalCer mAbs indicates that the interface of the β-ManCer-CD1d complex
exposed to the iNKT cell TCR can assume a structure like that of CD1d-α-GalCer,
despite its disparate carbohydrate structure. These results suggest that certain 
β-linked monoglycosylceramides can assume a structural display similar to that of
CD1d-α-GalCer and that the data based on anti-CD1d-α-GalCer binding should be
interpreted with caution.
