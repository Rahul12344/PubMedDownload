This study examined the relationship between complement activation and the
deposition of C3b and C4b on a panel of model immune complexes (IC). IC were
constructed by combining murine monoclonal IgM, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a or IgG3
anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies with DNP-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA). The 
IC were incubated with human plasma as a complement source and the formation of
C4a and C3a, as well as the deposition of C4b and C3b on the IC, measured by
radioimmunoassay. The results indicate that there were isotype-independent
variations in the capacity of different types of IC to activate the classical
pathway, especially for isotype-matched pairs of IC containing IgG1, IgG2a and
IgG3 antibodies. In most cases, there was a direct relationship between classical
pathway activation and the cleavage of C3. There was, for most of the IC, a
direct correlation between cleavage of C4 and C3 and the subsequent deposition of
C4b and C3b on the IC. However, a pair of IC constructed with independently
derived IgG1 antibodies was virtually identical with respect to C3 cleavage and
yet differed in the number of C3b molecules deposited on the IC. Collectively,
these data suggest that the immunoglobulin variable region can play a significant
role in both complement activation and the deposition of C3b and C4b on IC.
