The electronic properties of biomolecules and their hybrids with inorganic
materials can be utilized for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices. Here, we
report the charge transport behavior of protein-shelled inorganic nanoparticles
combined with graphene and demonstrate their possible application as a
bionanohybrid capacitor. The conductivity of PepA, a bacterial aminopeptidase
used as a protein shell (PS), and the platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) encapsulated
by PepA was measured using a field effect transistor (FET) and a graphene-based
FET (GFET). Furthermore, we confirmed that the electronic properties of
PepA-PtNPs were controlled by varying the size of the PtNPs. The use of two
poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-coated graphene layers separated by PepA-PtNPs
enabled us to build a bionanohybrid capacitor with tunable properties. The
combination of bioinorganic nanohybrids with graphene is regarded as the
cornerstone for developing flexible and biocompatible bionanoelectronic devices
that can be integrated into bioelectric circuits for biomedical purposes.
