[Infection as indicator of finding complex environmental noxious agents within a 
short time (author's transl)].

We do not know whether complexes of chemical agents produce an accumulation of
their respective noxious effects or whether these effects weaken each other and
we have no exact methods to quantify these effects. Knowledge of such methods
would be important for investigation of environmental health. In the course of
researches how to influence infectious diseases by altering natural resistance we
have found that it might be possible to use an indicator method: Animals exposed 
to such a light environmental toxic influence that they seem to be in a good
health have a reduced period of survival time and an altered steroid metabolism
after infection. The time of survival (after infection) and the steroid
metabolism are the indicators of some hidden trouble caused by environmental
influence. Here are three examples: 1) The covered intoxication with exhaust
fumes, 2) the covered intoxication with lead salt and 3) the covered intoxication
with DDT demonstrate the applicability of this method, results being available
within a period of 2--3 weeks.
