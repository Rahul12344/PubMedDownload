Helicobacter pylori, a microaerophilic gram-negative bacterium, colonizes the
human stomach. About 50% of the world's population is infected, and this
infection is considered as the major risk factor for the development of gastric
adenocarcinomas in 1% of infected subjects. Carcinogenesis is characterized by
the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in the course of which
fully differentiated epithelial cells turn into depolarized and migratory cells. 
Concomitant disruption of adherence junctions (AJ) is facilitated by growth
factors like hepatocyte growth factor 1 (HGF-1), but has been also shown to
depend on ectodomain shedding of E-cadherin. The aim of this study was to
investigate the impact of infection with H. pylori of NCI-N87 gastric epithelial 
cells on the shedding of E-cadherin and HGF-receptor c-Met. Our results show that
infection with H. pylori provokes shedding of the surface proteins c-Met and
E-cadherin. Evidence is provided that ADAM10 contributes to the shedding of c-Met
and E-cadherin.
