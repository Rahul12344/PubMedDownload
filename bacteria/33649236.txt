Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell
growth and metabolism that senses and integrates nutritional and environmental
cues with cellular responses. Recent studies have revealed critical roles of
mTORC1 in RNA biogenesis and processing. Here, we find that the m6A
methyltransferase complex (MTC) is a downstream effector of mTORC1 during
autophagy in Drosophila and human cells. Furthermore, we show that the Chaperonin
Containing Tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) complex, which facilitates
protein folding, acts as a link between mTORC1 and MTC. The mTORC1 activates the 
chaperonin CCT complex to stabilize MTC, thereby increasing m6A levels on the
messenger RNAs encoding autophagy-related genes, leading to their degradation and
suppression of autophagy. Altogether, our study reveals an evolutionarily
conserved mechanism linking mTORC1 signaling with m6A RNA methylation and
demonstrates their roles in suppressing autophagy.
