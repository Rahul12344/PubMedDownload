To explore the potential of aporphine alkaloids, a novel series of functionalized
aporphine analogues with alkoxy (OCH3 , OC2 H5 , OC3 H7 ) functional groups at
C1/C2 of ring A and an acyl (COCH3 and COPh) or phenylsulfonyl (SO2 Ph and SO2 C6
H4 -3-CH3 ) functionality at the N6 position of ring B of the aporphine scaffold 
were synthesized and evaluated for their arachidonic acid (AA)-induced
antiplatelet aggregation inhibitory activity and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
(DPPH) free-radical-scavenging antioxidant activity, with acetylsalicylic acid
and ascorbic acid as standard references, respectively. The preliminary
structure-activity relationship related to AA-induced platelet aggregation
inhibitory activity results showed that the aporphine analogues
1-[1,2,9,10-tetramethoxy-6a,7-dihydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quinolin-6(5H)-yl]ethanone 
and
1-[2-(benzyloxy)-1,9,10-trimethoxy-6a,7-dihydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quinolin-6(5H)-yl
]ethanone to be the best compounds of the series. Moreover, the DPPH
free-radical-scavenging antioxidant activity results demonstrated that the
aporphine analogues
1,2,9,10-tetramethoxy-6-(methylsulfonyl)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g]quin
oline,
2-ethoxy-1,9,10-trimethoxy-6-(methylsulfonyl)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g
]quinoline,
1-ethoxy-2,9,10-trimethoxy-6-(methylsulfonyl)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[de,g
]quinoline,
2,9,10-trimethoxy-6-(methylsulfonyl)-1-propoxy-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo[de,
g]quinoline, and
1-(benzyloxy)-2,9,10-trimethoxy-6-(methylsulfonyl)-5,6,6a,7-tetrahydro-4H-dibenzo
[de,g]quinoline were the best compounds of the series. Moreover, in silico
molecular docking simulation studies of the active analogues were also performed.
