Crotonobetaine reductase from Escherichia coli is composed of two proteins
(component I (CI) and component II (CII)). CI has been purified to
electrophoretic homogeneity from a cell-free extract of E. coli O44 K74. The
purified protein shows l(-)-carnitine dehydratase activity and its N-terminal
amino acid sequence is identical to the caiB gene product from E. coli O44 K74.
The relative molecular mass of CI has been determined to be 86100. It is composed
of two identical subunits with a molecular mass of 42600. The isoelectric point
of CI was found to be 4.3. CII was purified from an overexpression strain in one 
step by ion exchange chromatography on Fractogel EMD TMAE 650(S). The N-terminal 
amino acid sequence of CII shows absolute identity with the N-terminal sequence
of the caiA gene product, i.e. of the postulated crotonobetaine reductase. The
relative molecular mass of the protein is 164400 and it is composed of four
identical subunits of molecular mass 41500. The isoelectric point of CII is 5.6. 
CII contains non-covalently bound FAD in a molar ratio of 1:1. In the
crotonobetaine reductase reaction one dimer of CI associates with one tetramer of
CII. A still unknown low-molecular-mass effector described for the l(-)-carnitine
dehydratase is also necessary for crotonobetaine reductase activity. Monoclonal
antibodies were raised against the two components of crotonobetaine reductase.
