The immuno-pathogenetic mechanisms underlying chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis are
mainly unknown. Human Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection is associated with
Bb-specific secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which may be important for
the elimination of Bb, but this may also cause tissue injury. In order to
increase the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in chronic
neuroborreliosis, we investigated which cell types that secrete IFN-gamma. Blood 
mononuclear cells from 13 patients with neuroborreliosis and/or acrodermatitis
chronicum atrophicans were stimulated with Bb antigen and the phenotypes of the
induced IFN-gamma-secreting cells were analyzed with three different approaches. 
Cells expressing CD8 or TCRgammadelta, which both have cytolytic properties, were
the main phenotypes of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, indicating that tissue injury
in chronic neuroborreliosis may be mediated by cytotoxic cells.
