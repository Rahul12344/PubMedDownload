STAM containing an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and an immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motif was previously revealed to be implicated in
signaling pathways immediately downstream of Jak2 and Jak3 tyrosine kinases
associated with cytokine receptors. We molecularly cloned a novel molecule
interacting with the SH3 domain of STAM, which was named AMSH (associated
molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM). AMSH contains a putative bipartite nuclear
localization signal and a homologous region of a c-Jun activation domain-binding 
protein 1 (JAB1) subdomain in addition to a binding site for the SH3 domain of
STAM. AMSH mutant deleted of the C-terminal half conferred dominant negative
effects on signaling for DNA synthesis and c-myc induction mediated by
interleukin 2 and granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. These results
suggest that AMSH plays a critical role in the cytokine-mediated intracellular
signal transduction downstream of the Jak2/Jak3.STAM complex.
