Metagenomics has evolved over the last 3 decades from the analysis of single
genes and their apparent diversity in an ecosystem to the provision of complex
genetic information relating to whole ecosystems. Metagenomics is a vast subject 
area in terms of methodology, which encompasses a suite of molecular technologies
employed to investigate genomic information from all members of a microbial
community. However, the relatively recent developments in high-throughput
sequencing platforms have meant that metagenomic can be performed simply by
extracting DNA and sequencing it. Here, we outline explicit methodologies for the
extraction of metagenomic DNA from marine and sediments/soil environmental
samples, the subsequent production and sequencing of large-insert metagenomic
libraries, and also shotgun pyrosequencing considerations. We also provide
relevant advice on bioinformatic analyses of the complex metagenomic datasets. We
hope that the information provided here will be useful to establish the
techniques in most reasonably equipped molecular biology laboratories.
