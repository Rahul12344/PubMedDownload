The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to evaluate whether a recently
described multi-sensor approach called BIONOTE(®) is accurate enough to verify
the efficacy of treatment of patients with halitosis. A treatment with
Lactobacillus brevis (CD2)-containing lozenges, compared with placebo was tested.
The BIONOTE(®) was compared with traditional techniques used to detect halitosis:
OralChroma™ and two calibrated odor judges enrolled for the organoleptic
assessments. Twenty patients (10 treated and 10 placebo), suffering from active
phase halitosis were included in the study. Treatment consisted of Lactobacillus 
brevis (CD2)-containing lozenges or placebo, 4 tablets/day for 14 days. t0 was
before the beginning of the study; t1 was day 7 and t2 was day 14. The
effectiveness of treatment was assessed through: (1) Rosenberg score; (2) Winkel 
tongue coating index (WTCI) anterior and posterior; (2) OralChroma™; (3) the new 
developed multi-sensor approach, called BIONOTE(®) (test technique). Only the
WTCI anterior revealed statistically significant changes between t0 and t2 data
(p = 0.014) in the treated group. Except for the WTCI anterior, all diagnostic
methods revealed the lack of effectiveness for halitosis of a 14-days treatment
with Lactobacillus brevis (CD2)-containing lozenges. The BIONOTE(®) multisensor
system seems accurate in addition to OralChroma™ to assess the initial condition 
of halitosis and its mitigation during treatment.
