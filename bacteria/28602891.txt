To ensure comparable grafts for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT) in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases-sponsored
Investigational New Drug protocols for multiple sclerosis (HALT-MS) and systemic 
sclerosis (SCOT), a Drug Master File approach to control manufacture was
implemented, including a common Master Production Batch Record and site-specific 
standard operating procedures with "Critical Elements." We assessed comparability
of flow cytometry and controlled rate cryopreservation among sites and stability 
of cryopreserved grafts using hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) from healthy 
donors. Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells, Apheresis-CD34+ Enriched, for Autologous 
Use (Auto-CD34+HPC) graft specifications included ≥70% viable CD34+ cells before 
cryopreservation. For the 2 protocols, 110 apheresis collections were performed; 
121 lots of Auto-CD34+HPC were cryopreserved, and 107 of these (88.4%) met
release criteria. Grafts were infused at a median of 25 days (range, 17 to 68)
post-apheresis for HALT-MS (n = 24), and 25 days (range, 14 to 78) for SCOT
(n = 33). Subjects received precryopreservation doses of a median 5.1 × 106
viable CD34+ cells/kg (range, 3.9 to 12.8)  for HALT-MS and 5.6 × 106 viable
CD34+ cells/kg (range, 2.6 to 10.2) for SCOT. Recovery of granulocytes occurred
at a median of 11 days (range, 9 to 15) post-HCT for HALT-MS and 10 days (range, 
8 to 12) for SCOT, independent of CD34+ cell dose. Subjects received their last
platelet transfusion at a median of 9 days (range, 6 to 16) for HALT-MS and 8
days (range, 6 to 23) for SCOT; higher CD34+/kg doses were associated with faster
platelet recovery. Stability testing of cryopreserved healthy donor CD34+ HPCs
over 6 months of vapor phase liquid nitrogen storage demonstrated consistent 69% 
to 73% recovery of viable CD34+ cells. Manufacturing of Auto-CD34+HPC for the
HALT-MS and SCOT protocols was comparable across all sites and supportive for
timely recovery of granulocytes and platelets.
