Eosinophils are terminally differentiated granulocytes that have long been
considered as destructive cells associated with Th2 type immune responses such as
allergic inflammation and helminth infections. Recently, eosinophils have been
actively studied as multifunctional leukocytes regulating an array of
physiological responses through interaction with other immune cells. In this
study, we examined the expression and function of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in
eosinophilic EoL-1 cells and demonstrated the expression of a number of immune
mediators in activated EoL-1 cells and their interaction with the macrophage cell
line THP-1 upon TLR4 ligand stimulation. EoL-1 cells differentiated with butyrate
increased expression of TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7 at mRNA and protein level with flow 
cytometry analysis. Mature eosinophils derived from human cord blood CD34+ cells 
were subjected to RNA-sequencing, and showed the expression of a panel of TLR
transcripts and TLR4 was the most highly expressed TLR. Among the cognate ligands
of TLR3, TLR4, and TLR7, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or palmitic acid significantly 
increased mRNA expression of immune mediators in differentiated EoL-1 cells.
Notably, Western blot analysis of palmitic acid-treated differentiated EoL-1
cells showed significantly up-regulated expression of Th2 type cytokines and
transcription factors driving eosinophil differentiation. To evaluate functional 
significance of TLR4 ligand-stimulated eosinophils, we added conditioned media
(CM) from EoL-1 cells to differentiated THP-1 cells and assessed the expression
of M1 macrophage or M2 macrophage-related markers. M1 and M2 macrophage markers
were significantly upregulated by CM from LPS and palmitic acid stimulated EoL-1 
cells, respectively. In addition, the adipose tissue of obese mice, where
eosinophils are decreased due to obesity-induced inflammation, showed
significantly decreased frequency of M2 macrophages, despite an increase in the
total macrophage numbers. Based on these collective data, we proposed that
eosinophils regulate both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory polarization of
macrophages through functional changes induced by different TLR4 ligands.
