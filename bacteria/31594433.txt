It is difficult to believe that in about 1960 practically nothing was known about
the thymus and some of its products, T cells bearing αβ receptors for antigen.
Thus I was lucky to join the field of T cell biology almost at its beginning,
when knowledge about the cells was just getting off the ground and there was so
much to discover. This article describes findings about these cells made by
others and myself that led us all from ignorance, via complete confusion, to our 
current state of knowledge. I believe I was fortunate to practice science in very
supportive institutions and with very collaborative colleagues in two countries
that both encourage independent research by independent scientists, while
simultaneously ignoring or somehow being able to avoid some of the difficulties
of being a woman in what was, at the time, a male-dominated profession.
