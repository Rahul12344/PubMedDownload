RNA editing is a co- or post-transcriptional process in which select nucleotide
sequences in RNA are altered from that originally encoded in the genome. The
mRNAs encoding apolipoprotein B and some glutamate receptor subunits of
ionotropic membrane channels are edited by site-specific base-deamination
systems. Although these editing systems differ markedly in their mechanism for
RNA-substrate binding and in their catalytic subunits, recent results suggest
potentially common solutions to the problem of editing-site selectivity. The data
suggest that there are multiple editing complexes or 'editosomes', which manifest
editing-site preferences due to their macromolecular composition.
