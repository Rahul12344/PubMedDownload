Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) remains a major complication of
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). CD146 and CCR5 are proteins 
that mark activated T helper 17 (Th17) cells. The Th17 cell phenotype is promoted
by the interaction of the receptor ICOS on T cells with ICOS ligand (ICOSL) on
dendritic cells (DCs). We performed multiparametric flow cytometry in a cohort of
156 HCT recipients and conducted experiments with aGVHD murine models to
understand the role of ICOSL+ DCs. We observed an increased frequency of ICOSL+
plasmacytoid DCs, correlating with CD146+CCR5+ T cell frequencies, in the 64 HCT 
recipients with gastrointestinal aGVHD. In murine models, donor bone marrow cells
from ICOSL-deficient mice compared to those from wild-type mice reduced
aGVHD-related mortality. Reduced aGVHD resulted from lower intestinal
infiltration of pDCs and pathogenic Th17 cells. We transplanted activated human
ICOSL+ pDCs along with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells into
immunocompromised mice and observed infiltration of intestinal CD146+CCR5+ T
cells. We found that prophylactic administration of a dual human ICOS/CD28
antagonist (ALPN-101) prevented aGVHD in this model better than did the
clinically approved belatacept (CTLA-4-Fc), which binds CD80 (B7-1) and CD86
(B7-2) and interferes with the CD28 T cell costimulatory pathway. When started at
onset of aGVHD signs, ALPN-101 treatment alleviated symptoms of ongoing aGVHD and
improved survival while preserving antitumoral cytotoxicity. Our data identified 
ICOSL+-pDCs as an aGVHD biomarker and suggest that coinhibition of the ICOSL/ICOS
and B7/CD28 axes with one biologic drug may represent a therapeutic opportunity
to prevent or treat aGVHD.
