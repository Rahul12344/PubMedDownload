Natural defences in the human body function to protect us from numerous
environmental toxins and exposure to potential harmful biological agents. An
important frontline defence is antimicrobial peptides. These peptides occur at
environmental interfaces and serve to limit bacterial invasion. There has been
little work comparing specific peptides as potential antimicrobial compounds. In 
this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of peptides from the human
beta-defensin (HBD) family against four species of Bacillus, chosen as models for
Bacillus anthracis, a potential bioweapon. The impact of peptide concentration,
sequence and protein binding was evaluated on their biological activity. The
results indicated that HBD-3 was the most biologically active against Bacillus
subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis, whilst HBD-2 was found to be most active
against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus thuringiensis. Moreover, the antimicrobial
activity of the peptides was directly related to peptide concentration and
indirectly related to albumin concentration (i.e. protein binding).
