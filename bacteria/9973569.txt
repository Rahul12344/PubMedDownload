Glutaredoxins (Grxs) catalyze reversible oxidation/reduction of protein disulfide
groups and glutathione-containing mixed disulfide groups via an active site
Grx-glutathione mixed disulfide (Grx-SG) intermediate. The NMR solution structure
of the Escherichia coli Grx3 mixed disulfide with glutathione (Grx3-SG) was
determined using a C14S mutant which traps this intermediate in the redox
reaction. The structure contains a thioredoxin fold, with a well-defined binding 
site for glutathione which involves two intermolecular backbone-backbone hydrogen
bonds forming an antiparallel intermolecular beta-bridge between the protein and 
glutathione. The solution structure of E. coli Grx3-SG also suggests a binding
site for a second glutathione in the reduction of the Grx3-SG intermediate, which
is consistent with the specificity of reduction observed in Grxs. Molecular
details of the structure in relation to the stability of the intermediate and the
activity of Grx3 as a reductant of glutathione mixed disulfide groups are
discussed. A comparison of glutathione binding in Grx3-SG and ligand binding in
other members of the thioredoxin superfamily is presented, which illustrates the 
highly conserved intermolecular interactions in this protein family.
