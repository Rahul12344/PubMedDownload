Human monocytes produce a factor that supports the growth of B lymphocyte
hybridoma cells, termed hybridoma growth factor (HGF). By using expression
cloning in Escherichia coli of complementary DNA derived from human
monocyte-poly(A+) RNA, we selected seven clones producing HGF activity as
measured in a bioassay, based on the induction of proliferation of the
HGF-dependent B cell hybridoma B9. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that
HGF is identical with interferon-beta 2, 26,000 protein, and B cell stimulatory
factor-2. One of the active clones contained a cDNA that encoded a recombinant
product lacking the 28-amino acid long signal peptide and the first 15 amino
acids of the mature protein. Antibodies against the recombinant HGF inhibited the
biologic activity of recombinant HGF as well as of monocyte-derived HGF.
