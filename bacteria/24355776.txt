The toxicity of 16 pharmaceutical active ionic liquids (IL-APIs) was evaluated by
automated approaches based on sequential injection analysis (SIA). The
implemented bioassays were centered on the inhibition of human carboxylesterase 2
and Vibrio fischeri, in the presence of the tested compounds. The inhibitory
effects were quantified by calculating the inhibitor concentration required to
cause 50% of inhibition (EC50). The EC50 values demonstrated that the
cetylpyridinium group was one of the most toxic cations and that the imidazolium 
group was the less toxic. The obtained results provide important information
about the safety of the studied IL-APIs and their possible use as pharmaceutical 
drugs. The developed automated SIA methodologies are robust screening bioassays, 
and can be used as a generic tools to identify the (eco)toxicity of the
structural elements of ILs, contributing to a sustainable development of drugs.
