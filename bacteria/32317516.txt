Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) are major
endothelial growth factor receptors that influence the growth of a tumor.
Microvessel density.
(: MVD) is the quantification method of various aspects of tumor vasculature that
indicates angiogenic activity. This study aims to analyze the correlation between
MVD to the expression of VEGFRs on breast cancer tissue.
Materials and Method: A total of 60 N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced breast
carcinomas in rats were suppressed by using antiangiogenic drugs. The rats were
then sacrificed, and the tumor was fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin embedded, and 
immunohistochemistry stained using VEGFRs and CD34.
Result: One-way ANOVA test showed a significant difference in all markers that
have been used (P < 0.05) on MNU-breast tumor treated with rapamycin (M= 90.1664,
SD= 7.4487), PF4 (M= 93.7946, SD= 7.1303) and rapamycin + PF4 (M= 93.6990, SD=
1.8432). We obtained a significant reduction of MVD count on breast carcinoma for
rapamycin group (M= 25.6786, SD= 9.7075) and rapamycin + PF4 group (M= 30.5250,
SD= 13.6928) while PF4 group (M=47.7985, SD=4.8892) showed slightly increase
compared to control (M= 45.1875, SD= 4.4786). There was a moderately strong,
positive correlation between angiogenic markers; Flt-1 (r= 0.544, n=60, P <
0.005) and Flt-4 (r= 0.555, n= 60, P < 0.005) while Flk-1 (r= 0.797, n= 60, P <
0.005) showed a strong, positive correlation with MVD.
Conclusion: MVD was strongly correlated to the VEGFRs expression on breast
carcinoma.
