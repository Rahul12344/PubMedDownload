While investigating the virulence traits of Staphylococcus aureus adhering to the
skin of atopic-dermatitis (AD) patients, we identified a novel open reading frame
(ORF) with structural similarity to a superantigen from genome sequence data of
an isolate from AD skin. Concurrently, the same ORF was identified in a bovine
isolate of S. aureus and designated SElY (H. K. Ono, Y. Sato'o, K. Narita, I.
Naito, et al., Appl Environ Microbiol 81:7034-7040, 2015,
https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01873-15). Recombinant SElYbov had superantigen
activity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It further demonstrated
emetic activity in a primate animal model, and it was proposed that SElY be
renamed SEY (H. K. Ono, S. Hirose, K. Narita, M. Sugiyama, et al., PLoS Pathog
15:e1007803, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007803). Here, we
investigated the prevalence of the sey gene in 270 human clinical isolates of
various origins in Japan. Forty-two strains were positive for the sey gene, and
the positive isolates were from patients with the skin diseases atopic dermatitis
and impetigo/staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), with a detection rate
of ∼17 to 22%. There were three variants of SEY (SEY1, SEY2, and SEY3), and
isolates producing SEY variants formed three distinct clusters corresponding to
clonal complexes (CCs) 121, 59, and 20, respectively. Most sey + isolates
produced SEY in broth culture. Unlike SEYbov, the three recombinant SEY variants 
exhibited stability against heat treatment. SEY predominantly activated human T
cells with a particular T-cell receptor (TCR) Vα profile, a unique observation
since most staphylococcal enterotoxins exert their superantigenic activities
through activating T cells with specific TCR Vβ profiles. SEY may act to induce
localized inflammation via skin-resident T-cell activation, facilitating the
pathogenesis of S. aureus infection in disrupted epithelial barriers.
