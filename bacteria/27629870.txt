Autophagy, a catabolic pathway of lysosomal degradation, acts not only as an
efficient recycle and survival mechanism during cellular stress, but also as an
anti-infective machinery. The human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)
was originally considered solely as an extracellular bacterium, but is now
recognized additionally to invade host cells, which might be crucial for
persistence. However, the intracellular fate of S. aureus is incompletely
understood. Here, we show for the first time induction of selective autophagy by 
S. aureus infection, its escape from autophagosomes and proliferation in the
cytoplasm using live cell imaging. After invasion, S. aureus becomes
ubiquitinated and recognized by receptor proteins such as SQSTM1/p62 leading to
phagophore recruitment. Yet, S. aureus evades phagophores and prevents further
degradation by a MAPK14/p38Î± MAP kinase-mediated blockade of autophagy. Our study
demonstrates a novel bacterial strategy to block autophagy and secure survival
inside the host cell.
