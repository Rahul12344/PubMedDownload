Comment in
    Cell Host Microbe. 2018 Jul 11;24(1):8-9.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by pathogen infection and
associated with pyroptosis. Pyroptosis occurs upon activation of proinflammatory 
caspases and their subsequent cleavage of gasdermin D (GSDMD), resulting in GSDMD
N-terminal fragments that form membrane pores to induce cell lysis. Here, we show
that antioxidant defense enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and its ability
to decrease lipid peroxidation, negatively regulate macrophage pyroptosis, and
septic lethality in mice. Conditional Gpx4 knockout in myeloid lineage cells
increases lipid peroxidation-dependent caspase-11 activation and GSDMD cleavage. 
The resultant N-terminal GSDMD fragments then trigger macrophage pyroptotic cell 
death in a phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLCG1)-dependent fashion. Administration of
the antioxidant vitamin E that reduces lipid peroxidation, chemical inhibition of
PLCG1, or genetic Caspase-11 deletion or Gsdmd inactivation prevents
polymicrobial sepsis in Gpx4-/- mice. Collectively, this study suggests that
lipid peroxidation drives GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis and hence constitutes a
potential therapeutic target for lethal infection.
