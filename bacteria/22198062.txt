Airway surface fluid contains two layers of mucins consisting mainly of 5
different mucin gene products. While the outer layer contains two gel-forming
mucins (MUC5AC and MUC5B) that are tightly associated with various biologically
active, defensive molecules, the inner layer contains three membrane-tethered
mucins (MUC1, MUC4 and MUC16) shed from the apical cell surface. During airway
infection, all of these mucins serve as a major protective barrier against
pathogens. MUC1 mucin produced by virtually all the surface columnar epithelial
cells in the respiratory tract as well as Type II pneumocytes in the alveoli
plays an additional, perhaps more critical role during respiratory infection by
controlling the resolution of inflammation that is essential to prevent the
development of inflammatory lung disease.
