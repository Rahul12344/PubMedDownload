In our screening efforts to identify unique scaffolds from myxobacteria for the
drug discovery process, we used LC-SPE-NMR-MS techniques to isolate six linear
peptides, termed macyranone A-F, from Cystobacter fuscus MCy9118. The macyranones
are characterized by a rare 2-methylmalonamide moiety and an α-amino ketone
fragment including an α',β'-epoxyketone in macyranone A. Gene disruption
experiments confirmed the biosynthetic gene cluster of the macyranones as
PKS/NRPS hybrid. Detailed in silico and phylogenetic analysis unraveled that the 
biosynthesis involves two conspicuous amide bond formations accomplished by an
amidotransferase and a unique condensation domain. The gene cluster provides
further insights into the formation of the powerful epoxyketone residue involving
an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and an unconventional free-standing thioesterase.
Macyranone A was found to inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of the yeast 20S
proteasome with an IC50 of 5.9 nM and the human constitutive proteasome and
immunoproteasome with IC50 values of 21 and 15 nM, respectively. The β5 subunit
of the 20S proteasome was characterized as target by X-ray crystallography
revealing an irreversible binding mode similar to the natural product epoxomicin.
The presence of the methylmalonamide residue facilitates the stabilization of
macyranone A with the active β5 subunit of the proteasome. Macyranone A exhibits 
a potent inhibitory effect against the parasites Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense
and Leishmania donovani with IC50 values of 1.55 and 0.22 μM, respectively.
