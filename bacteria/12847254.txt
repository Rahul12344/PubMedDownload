HLA-DM stabilizes peptide-receptive class II alphabeta dimers and facilitates the
capture of high affinity peptides, thus influencing the peptide repertoire
presented by class II molecules. Variations in DM levels may therefore have a
profound effect on the antigenic focus of T cell-mediated immune responses.
Specifically, DM expression may influence susceptibility and resistance to
autoimmune diseases. In this study the role of DM in HLA-DR4-restricted
presentation of an insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus autoantigen, glutamate
decarboxylase (GAD), was tested. Presentation of immunodominant GAD epitope
273-285 was regulated by endogenous DM levels in human B lymphoblasts. T cell
responses to exogenous GAD as well as an endogenous cytoplasmic form of this Ag
were significantly diminished with increasing cellular expression of DM. Epitope 
editing by DM was observed only using Ag and not small synthetic peptides,
suggesting that this process occurred within endosomes. Results with cytoplasmic 
GAD also indicated that peptides from this compartment intersect class II
proteins in endocytic vesicles where DM editing was facilitated. Changes in DM
levels within APC may therefore influence the presentation of autoantigens and
the development of autoimmune disorders such as type I diabetes.
