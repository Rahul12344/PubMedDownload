Polysaccharide A (PSA), the archetypical immunomodulatory molecule of the gut
commensal Bacteroides fragilis, induces regulatory T cells to secrete the
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). The cellular mediators of
PSA's immunomodulatory properties are incompletely understood. In a mouse model
of colitis, we find that PSA requires both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms 
to generate protection. Plasmacytoid DCs (PDCs) exposed to PSA do not produce
proinflammatory cytokines, but instead they specifically stimulate IL-10
secretion by CD4+ T cells and efficiently mediate PSA-afforded immunoprotection. 
PSA induces and preferentially ligates Toll-like receptor 2 on PDCs but not on
conventional DCs. Compared with other TLR2 ligands, PSA is better at enhancing
PDC expression of costimulatory molecules required for protection against
colitis. PDCs can thus orchestrate the beneficial immunoregulatory interaction of
commensal microbial molecules, such as PSA, through both innate and adaptive
immune mechanisms.
