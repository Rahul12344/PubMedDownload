We describe a case of human tularemia caused by Francisella tularensis subsp.
holarctica in a stem cell transplant recipient with chronic graft-versus-host
disease who was receiving levofloxacin prophylaxis. The infection was
characterized by pneumonia with septic complications. The patient was
successfully treated with doxycycline.
