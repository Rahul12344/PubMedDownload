The glyoxylate cycle is a sequence of anaplerotic reactions catalyzed by the key 
enzymes isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase, and plays an important role
in the pathogenesis of microorganisms during infection. An icl-deletion mutant of
Candida albicans exhibited reduced virulence in mice compared with the wild type.
Five diketopiperazines, which are small and stable cyclic peptides, isolated from
the marine-derived Streptomyces puniceus Act1085, were evaluated for their
inhibitory effects on C. albicans ICL. The structures of these compounds were
elucidated based on spectroscopic data and comparisons with previously reported
data. Cyclo(L-Phe-L-Val) was identified as a potent ICL inhibitor, with a half
maximal inhibitory concentration of 27 Î¼g/mL. Based on the growth phenotype of
the icl-deletion mutants and icl expression analyses, we demonstrated that
cyclo(L-Phe-L-Val) inhibits the gene transcription of ICL in C. albicans under
C2-carbon-utilizing conditions.
