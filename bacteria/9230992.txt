BACKGROUND: An increase in the incidence of group A beta hemolytic streptococcal 
(GABHS) infections in children has been recently noted with a frequent
association with varicella.
CASE REPORTS: Two children, 3 and 4.5 years old, developed varicella. The first
one was febrile and presented a phlyctene on his left foot. Few hours after his
admission, he presented a septic shock; GABHS was isolated from blood. Despite
immediate adapted antibiotherapy, he developed a right tibial osteomyelitis with 
abscess. The second child also developed varicella and was hospitalized because
of fever, bad general condition, right cervical adenitis and edema on the left
wrist. Edema rapidly extended to the hand and upper arm. One purulent lesion was 
noted on the upper arm from whom Staphylococcus aureus and GABHS were isolated.
Blood samples were sterile. The clinical course was favorable with adapted
antibiotherapy. A cutaneous desquamation was observed on the 9th day and we
concluded that it was a GABHS cellulitis.
CONCLUSION: These two cases confirm the recent report of increase in GABHS
infections associated with varicella. Such complications must be looked for in
patients with varicella remaining abnormally febrile and/or presenting unusual
manifestations.
