One factor that may contribute to variability between different lots of purified 
collagenase to recover islets is the molecular form of C. histolyticum class I
(C1) collagenase used in the isolation procedure. Two different enzyme mixtures
containing C1, class II (C2) collagenase and BP Protease were compared for their 
effectiveness to recover islets from split adult porcine pancreas. The same
enzyme activities per g trimmed tissue were used for all isolations with the only
difference being the mass of C1 required to achieve 25,000 collagen degradation
activity U/g tissue. The results show no differences in performance of the two
enzyme mixtures. The only significant difference is 19 fold more truncated C1 was
required to achieve the same result as intact C1.
