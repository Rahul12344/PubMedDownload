The PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis contributes to the activation, survival, and
proliferation of CD4(+) T cells upon stimulation through TCR and CD28. Here, we
demonstrate that the suppression of this axis by deletion of p85α or PI3K/mTORC1 
inhibitors as well as T cell-specific deletion of raptor, an essential component 
of mTORC1, impairs Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo in a
S6K1/2-dependent fashion. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1 axis impairs the
downregulation of Gfi1, a negative regulator of Th17 differentiation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that S6K2, a nuclear counterpart of S6K1, is induced 
by the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 axis, binds RORγ, and carries RORγ to the nucleus. These
results point toward a pivotal role of PI3K-Akt-mTORC1-S6K1/2 axis in Th17
differentiation.
