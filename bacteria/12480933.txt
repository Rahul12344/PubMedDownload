The Mcm2-7p heterohexamer is the presumed replicative helicase in eukaryotic
cells. Each of the six subunits is required for replication. We have purified the
six Saccharomyces cerevisiae MCM proteins as recombinant proteins in Escherichia 
coli and have reconstituted the Mcm2-7p complex from individual subunits. Study
of MCM ATPase activity demonstrates that no MCM protein hydrolyzes ATP
efficiently. ATP hydrolysis requires a combination of two MCM proteins. The
fifteen possible pairwise mixtures of MCM proteins yield only three pairs of MCM 
proteins that produce ATPase activity. Study of the Mcm3/7p ATPase shows that an 
essential arginine in Mcm3p is required for hydrolysis of the ATP bound to Mcm7p.
Study of the pairwise interactions between MCM proteins connects the remaining
MCM proteins to the Mcm3/7p pair. The data predict which subunits in the ATPase
pairs bind the ATP that is hydrolyzed and indicate the arrangement of subunits in
the Mcm2-7p heterohexamer.
