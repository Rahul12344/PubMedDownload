Pancreatic duct cells are equipped with acid/base transporters important for
exocrine secretion. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells may utilize
such transporters to acidify extracellular tumor microenvironment, creating a
niche favoring cell proliferation, fibrosis and resistance to chemotherapy-all
contributing to the notoriously bad prognosis of this disease. Here, we report
that gastric and non-gastric H+, K+-ATPases (coded by ATP4A and ATP12A) are
overexpressed in human and murine pancreatic cancer and that we can target them
specifically with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and potassium-competitive acid
blockers (P-CABs) in in vitro models of PDAC. Focusing on pantoprazole, we show
that it significantly reduced human cancer cell proliferation by inhibiting
cellular H+ extrusion, increasing K+ conductance and promoting cyclin
D1-dependent cell cycle arrest and preventing STAT3 activation. Pantoprazole also
decreased collagen secretion from pancreatic stellate cells. Importantly, in vivo
studies show that pantoprazole treatment of tumor-bearing mice reduced tumor
size, fibrosis and expression of angiogenic markers. This work provides the first
evidence that H+, K+-ATPases contribute to PDAC progression and that these can be
targeted by inhibitors of these pumps, thus proving a promising therapeutic
strategy.
