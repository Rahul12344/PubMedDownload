Azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus (ARAF) has been reported in patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but has not been specifically
assessed so far. Here, we evaluated ARAF prevalence in azole-naïve COPD patients 
and their homes, and assessed whether CYP51A mutations were similar in clinical
and environmental reservoirs. Sixty respiratory samples from 41 COPD patients
with acute exacerbation and environmental samples from 36 of these patient's
homes were prospectively collected. A. fumigatus was detected in respiratory
samples from 11 of 41 patients (27%) and in 15 of 36 domiciles (42%). Cyp51A
sequencing and selection on itraconazole medium of clinical (n = 68) and
environmental (n = 48) isolates yielded ARAF detection in 1 of 11 A. fumigatus
colonized patients with COPD (9%) and 2 of 15 A. fumigatus-positive patient's
homes (13%). The clinical isolate had no CYP51A mutation. Two environmental
isolates from two patients harbored TR34 /L98H mutation, and one had an H285Y
mutation. Coexistence of different cyp51A genotypes and/or azole resistance
profiles was detected in 3 of 8 respiratory and 2 of 10 environmental samples
with more than one isolate, confirming the need for a systematic screening of all
clinically relevant isolates. The high prevalence of ARAF in patients with COPD
and their homes supports the need for further studies to assess the prevalence of
azole resistance in patients with Aspergillus diseases in Northern France.
