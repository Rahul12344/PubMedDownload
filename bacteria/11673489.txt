Many of the Ags recognized by human melanoma-reactive CTL are derived from
proteins that are also expressed in melanocytes. The possibility of
self-tolerance to these epitopes has led to questions about their utility for
antitumor immunotherapy. To investigate the issue, we established a preclinical
model based on transgenic mice expressing a recombinant HLA-A*0201 molecule and
B16 melanoma transfected to express this molecule. HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes
from the melanocyte differentiation proteins (MDP) tyrosinase and gp100 are
expressed in both tumor cells and melanocytes, and the former is associated with 
self-tolerance. However, adoptive transfer of tyrosinase or gp100-reactive CTL
developed from tolerant mice delayed tumor outgrowth, as did immunization with
MDP peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Protection was enhanced by the use of peptide
ligands containing conservative substitutions that were cross-reactive with the
original Ags. These data establish that CTL populations reactive against
MDP-derived self-Ags can be activated to mount effective antitumor immunity and
strongly support their continued development for tumor immunotherapy in humans.
