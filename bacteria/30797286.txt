Metformin (MET) is a potential combination drug to elevate anti-TB efficacy.
However, the clinical effect, especially smear reversion, during metformin
applied with anti-tuberculosis and insulin in patients with type 2 DM newly TB
co-infection were remain unknown. An observational clinical study was done in DM 
newly TB co-infection outpatients at Surabaya Paru Hospital. This study evaluated
MET therapy, at least 2 months, accompanying with insulin and anti-TB regimens
and compared to comparison group. The smear, microtubule-associated Protein1
Light Chain 3B (MAP1LC3B) level, as the presentation of autophagy, Superoxide
Dismutase (SOD) level, Interferon (IFN)-γ and Interleukin (IL)-10 levels were
evaluated twice. From 42 participants in this study, 22 participants of
observation group that received additional MET therapy, 100% had sputum smear
reversion after 2-months intensive phase of anti-TB therapy. Whereas 25% of 20
participants of comparison group did not undergo reversion inserts sputum smear. 
As conclusion, MET has the potential of being an additive combination therapy to 
enhance the bactericidal effect of anti-TB on DM-TB coinfection patients.
Metformin enhances the effects of anti-TB and insulin therapy in increasing the
smear reversion by increasing autophagy.
