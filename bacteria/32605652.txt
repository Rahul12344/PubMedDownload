BACKGROUND: Myxoma is a relatively rare mesenchymal tumor seen mainly in the
heart and skin. Renal myxomas in particular are exceptionally rare where only 17 
cases were previously reported in the English Language literature. Only 2 of the 
17 reported cases were located in the renal sinus/pelvis.
CASE PRESENTATION: This is a case of an 18-year-old male patient who complained
of right, colicky flank pain associated with abdominal pain and discomfort.
Imaging findings revealed right kidney hydronephrosis with a provisional
diagnosis of pelviureteric junction (PUJ) stenosis. On computed tomography, there
was a very faint thin walled mass abutting the calyces, camouflaged within the
dilated renal pelvis. During surgery, a polypoid mass was found at the
pelviureteric junction, causing the obstruction. Histological examination showed 
a hypocellular, paucivascular myxoid neoplasm, with few spindle cells displaying 
serpentine nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. The tumor cells expressed
immunoreactivity for vimentin, but not for S100, CD34, actin, or desmin. This
will qualify as the third case of renal pelvis myxoma.
CONCLUSION: Myxomas in the renal pelvis/sinus are extremely rare and can present 
with hydronephrosis and subtle radiological findings mimicking a PUJ stenosis.
Being aware of this entity can save the patient unnecessary nephrectomy with
possible preservation of the kidney.
