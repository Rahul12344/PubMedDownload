Hemodiafiltration combines diffusive and convective solute removal in a single
therapy by ultrafiltering 20% or more of the blood volume processed using a
high-flux hemodialyzer and maintaining fluid balance by infusing sterile
nonpyrogenic replacement fluid directly into the patient's blood. In online
hemodiafiltration, the large volumes of replacement fluid required are obtained
by online filtration of standard dialysate through a series of bacteria- and
endotoxin-retaining filters. Currently available systems for online
hemodiafiltration are on the basis of conventional dialysis machines with added
features to safely prepare and infuse replacement fluid and closely control fluid
balance. Hemodiafiltration provides greater removal of higher molecular weight
uremic retention solutes than conventional high-flux hemodialysis, and recently
completed randomized, controlled clinical trials suggest better patient survival 
with online hemodiafiltration compared with standard high-flux hemodialysis when 
a high convection volume is delivered. Hemodiafiltration is also associated with 
improvements in other clinical outcomes, such as a reduction in intradialytic
hypotension, and it is now used routinely to treat >100,000 patients, mainly in
Europe and Japan.
