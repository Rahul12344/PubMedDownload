Drinking water analysis for Legionella from building installations is done quite 
frequently. Some questions arise from experience with this analysis. They will be
discussed to allow uniform and comparable execution. Application of DIN EN ISO
19458 will lead to changes in the sampling procedure. This may make changes
necessary even in current sampling and assessment programs. Concerning laboratory
investigation, quality control of membrane filters and media turned out to be
crucial. The assessment of quantitative results requires knowledge of the
drinking water distribution system and of other facts that may be relevant for
hygiene. Therefore, the assessment ought to be conducted by somebody with the
respective knowledge.
