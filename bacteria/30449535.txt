MR1 is a non-classical class I molecule that is highly conserved among mammals.
Though discovered in 1995, only recently have MR1 ligands and antigens for
MR1-restricted T cells been described. Unlike the traditional class I molecules
HLA-A, -B, and -C, little MR1 is on the cell surface. Rather, MR1 resides in
discrete intracellular vesicles and the endoplasmic reticulum, and can present
non-peptidic small molecules such as those found in the riboflavin biosynthesis
pathway. Since mammals do not synthesize riboflavin, MR1 can serve as a sensor of
the microbial metabolome and could be key to the early detection of intracellular
infection. This review will summarize the current understanding of MR1-dependent 
antigen presentation.
