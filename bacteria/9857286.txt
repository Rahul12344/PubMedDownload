Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance is characterized by an impaired
proinflammatory cytokine production upon restimulation of mononuclear cells with 
LPS. LPS is considered the primary activator for this phenomenon. In response to 
major injury and extensive abdominal surgery, an immune reaction comparable to
LPS tolerance has been described. Therefore, it was investigated whether primary 
stimuli other than LPS could induce cytokine downregulation. In eight patients
who underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, blood was obtained before and after
induction of anaesthesia and 2, 6, and 24 hr postoperatively. Ex vivo stimulation
of whole blood resulted in a transient reduction (nadir 2 hr postoperatively) of 
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, and interferon-gamma
release, while IL-1 receptor antagonist production increased. Stress hormones,
LPS-binding protein, and bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein do not seem
to be involved. This study shows that minimally invasive surgery, in the absence 
of endotoxemia, can induce LPS desensitization. These data suggest that prior
endotoxemia is not essential for the development of LPS tolerance.
