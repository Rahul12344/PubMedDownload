Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major sign of severe liver disease and the
impact of associated bacterial infections should be better evaluated. A
retrospective cohort of 333 patients with cirrhosis and HE was analyzed in three 
periods of time, from 1984 to 1998. Variance analysis, Wilcoxon, Chi-square and
Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical comparisons. Prevalence of
bacterial infections decreased along the time (p = 0.0029). Spontaneous Bacterial
Peritonitis -SBP- (37%) and urinary tract infection (30%) were the more frequent 
types of bacterial infections. Early death was significantly higher in HE with
infection (46,47%) and the calculated RR was 2.047. Prognosis was worse in
septicemia (79%) and respiratory tract infection (50%) and better in urinary
tract infection (27%). SBP lethality was reduced from 70% to 38% (p = 0.062). In 
conclusion, lower prevalence of bacterial infections, in severe liver disease,
was achieved in the last decade, but short-term prognosis remains bad, varying
according to the type of bacterial infection.
