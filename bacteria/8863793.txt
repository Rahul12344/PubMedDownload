S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase has been shown to have (5'/6')
hydrolytic activity with vinyl (5') or homovinyl (6') halides derived from
adenosine (Ado). This hydrolytic activity is independent of its 3'-oxidative
activity. The vinyl (or homovinyl) halides are converted into 5'(or
6')-carboxaldehydes by the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme, and inactivation
occurs via the oxidative activity. Amide and ester derivatives of
Ado-5'-carboxylic acid were prepared to further probe the hydrolytic capability
of AdoHcy hydrolase. The oxidative activity (but not the hydrolytic activity) is 
involved in the mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme by the ester and amide
derivatives of Ado-5'-carboxylic acid, in contrast to the inactivation of this
enzyme by adenosine-derived vinyl or homovinyl halide analogues during which both
activities are manifested.
