Chlamydiaceae are obligate intracellular bacteria that do not synthesise
detectable peptidoglycan although they possess an almost complete arsenal of
genes encoding peptidoglycan biosynthetic activities. In this paper, the murF
gene from Chlamydia trachomatis was shown to be capable of complementing a
conditional Escherichia coli mutant impaired in UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide:D-Ala-D-Ala
ligase activity. Recombinant MurF from C. trachomatis was overproduced and
purified from E. coli. It exhibited ATP-dependent
UDP-MurNAc-X-γ-D-Glu-meso-A(2)pm:D-Ala-D-Ala ligase activity in vitro. No
significant difference of kinetic parameters was seen when X was L-Ala, L-Ser or 
Gly. The L-Lys-containing UDP-MurNAc-tripeptide was a poorer substrate as
compared to the meso-A(2)pm-containing one. Based on the respective substrate
specificities of the chlamydial MurC, MurE, MurF and Ddl enzymes, a sequence
L-Ala/L-Ser/Gly-γ-D-Glu-meso-A(2)pm-D-Ala-D-Ala is expected for the chlamydial
pentapeptide stem, with Gly at position 1 being less likely.
