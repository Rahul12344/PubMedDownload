The numbers of unanswered questions are many. Can intraoperative application,
such as topical antimicrobial use in pulsed lavage, reduce the microbial burden
on the wound interface before closure? Can closed suction drains within the
closed surgical incision reduce infection rates, especially in patients with a
large body mass index? What is the role of delayed primary closure or secondary
closure in the wound where obvious contamination has occurred, or in the
circumstance of emergent colonic resection where considerable contamination is
encountered from preexistent perforation? Should immediate negative-pressure
wound dressings be applied in the open contaminated wound? These and many other
questions still confront the surgeon in the challenge of the surgical wound in
major colorectal surgery.
