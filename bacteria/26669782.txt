Metastasis causes most cancer related mortality but the mechanisms governing
metastatic dissemination are poorly defined. Metastasis involves egression of
cancer cells from the primary tumors, their survival in circulation and
colonization at the secondary sites. Cancer cell egression from the primary tumor
is the least defined process of metastasis as experimental metastasis models
directly seed cancer cells in circulation, thus bypassing this crucial step.
Here, we developed a spontaneous metastasis model that retains the egression step
of metastasis. By repeated in vivo passaging of the poorly metastatic Lewis lung 
carcinoma (3LL) cells, we generated a cell line (p-3LL) that readily metastasizes
to lungs and liver from subcutaneous (s.c.) tumors. Interestingly, when injected 
intravenously, 3LL and p-3LL cells showed a similar frequency of metastasis. This
suggests enhanced egression of p-3LL cells may underlie the enhanced metastatic
spread from primary tumors. Microarray analysis of 3LL and p-3LL cells as well as
the primary tumors derived from these cells revealed altered expression of
several genes including significant upregulation of a tight junction protein,
claudin-9. Increased expression of claudin-9 was confirmed in both p-3LL cells
and tumors derived from these cells. Knockdown of claudin-9 expression in p-3LL
cells by si-RNA significantly reduced their motility, invasiveness in vitro and
metastasis in vivo. Conversely, transient overexpression of claudin-9 in 3LL
cells enhanced their motility. These results suggest an essential role for
claudin-9 in promoting lung cancer metastasis.
