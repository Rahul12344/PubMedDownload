Multivalent ions in solution are known to mediate attraction between two
like-charged molecules. Such attraction has proved useful in atomic force
microscopy (AFM) where DNA may be immobilized to a mica surface facilitating
direct imaging in liquid. Theories of DNA immobilization suggest that either
'salt bridging' or fluctuation in the positions of counter ions about both the
mica surface and DNA backbone secure DNA to the mica substrate. Whilst both
theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that immobilization is possible in 
the presence of divalent ions, very few studies identify that such immobilization
is possible with monovalent ions. Here we present direct AFM evidence of DNA
immobilized to mica in the presence of only monovalent ions. Our data depict E.
coli plasmid pBR322 adsorbed onto the negatively charged mica both after short
(10 min) and long (24 h) incubation periods. These data suggest the need to
re-explore current theories of like-charge attraction to include the possibility 
of monovalent interactions. We suggest that this DNA immobilization strategy may 
offer the potential to image natural processes with limited immobilization forces
and hence enable maximum conformational freedom of the immobilized biomolecule.
