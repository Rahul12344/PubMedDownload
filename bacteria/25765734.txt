The L1014F mutation in the voltage-sodium channel gene has been associated with
resistance to DDT and pyrethroids in various arthropod species including
mosquitoes. We determined the frequency of the L1014F kdr mutation in 16 field
populations of Culex quinquefasciatus from Northeastern Mexico collected between 
2008 and 2013. The L1014F was present in all populations analyzed with the lowest
frequency (3.33%) corresponding to the population from Monclova collected in
2012, and the highest frequency (63.63%) from the Monterrey population collected 
in 2012. The presence of a kdr mutation in populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus
from northeastern Mexico provides evidence of pyrethroid resistance. This
requires a special attention, considering that pyrethroid-based insecticides are 
commonly used in vector-control campaigns, especially against Aedes aegypti (L.).
