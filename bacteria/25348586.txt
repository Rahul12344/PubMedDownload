Bacteria and archaea have 2-lysylcytidine (L or lysidine) and 2-agmatinylcytidine
(agm(2)C or agmatidine), respectively, at the first (wobble) position of the
anticodon of the AUA codon-specific tRNA(Ile). These lysine- or
agmatine-conjugated cytidine derivatives are crucial for the precise decoding of 
the genetic code. L is synthesized by tRNA(Ile)-lysidine synthetase (TilS), which
uses l-lysine and ATP as substrates. Agm(2)C formation is catalyzed by
tRNA(Ile)-agm(2)C synthetase (TiaS), which uses agmatine and ATP for the
reaction. Despite the fact that TilS and TiaS synthesize structurally similar
cytidine derivatives, these enzymes belong to non-related protein families.
Therefore, these enzymes modify the wobble cytidine by distinct catalytic
mechanisms, in which TilS activates the C2 carbon of the wobble cytidine by
adenylation, while TiaS activates it by phosphorylation. In contrast, TilS and
TiaS share similar tRNA recognition mechanisms, in which the enzymes recognize
the tRNA acceptor stem to discriminate tRNA(Ile) and tRNA(Met).
