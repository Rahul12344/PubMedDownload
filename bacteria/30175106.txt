Eukaryotic cells, when faced with unfavorable environmental conditions, mount
either pro-survival or pro-death programs. The conserved cyclin C-Cdk8 kinase
plays a key role in this decision. Both are members of the Cdk8 kinase module
that, along with Med12 and Med13, associate with the core Mediator complex of RNA
polymerase II. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oxidative stress triggers Med13
destruction, which releases cyclin C into the cytoplasm to promote mitochondrial 
fission and programmed cell death. The SCFGrr1 ubiquitin ligase mediates Med13
degradation dependent on the cell wall integrity pathway, MAPK Slt2. Here we show
that the AMP kinase Snf1 activates a second SCFGrr1 responsive degron in Med13.
Deletion of Snf1 resulted in nuclear retention of cyclin C and failure to induce 
mitochondrial fragmentation. This degron was able to confer
oxidative-stress-induced destruction when fused to a heterologous protein in a
Snf1 dependent manner. Although snf1âˆ† mutants failed to destroy Med13, deleting
the degron did not prevent destruction. These results indicate that the control
of Med13 degradation following H2O2 stress is complex, being controlled
simultaneously by CWI and MAPK pathways.
