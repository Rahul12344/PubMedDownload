Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochaetes
Borrelia burgdorferi, B. garinii and B. afzelii. It comprises a wide spectrum of 
symptoms affecting skin, musculoskeletal system, heart, eyes, central and
peripheral nervous system. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings in
combination with detection of specific IgM and/or IgG antibodies. Diagnostic
problems arise from patients with non-specific symptoms and positive IgG antibody
detection. Adequate antibiotic therapy cures more than 90% of the patients.
However, in some patients repeated therapy is necessary and a small number of
patients develop chronic arthritis or other features. While there is currently no
vaccine available, prevention of tick bite is the most effective prophylaxis.
