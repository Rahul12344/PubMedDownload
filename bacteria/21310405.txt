BACKGROUND: Thrombocyte concentrate i.e. platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has become a 
popular adjunct for many surgical procedures. It is believed to improve bone and 
soft tissue healing. Recently antimicrobial effects of the autologous preparation
were reported by several groups. In this study we investigated the antimicrobial 
effect of PRP against gram-negative microbes which frequently cause severe
complications in orthopaedic trauma surgery.
METHODS: Platelet-rich plasma was produced from liquid preserved thrombocyte
concentrates. ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were preformed to
investigate the release and content of platelet concentrates. A radial diffusion 
assay was used to detect antimicrobial effects of PRP.
RESULTS: We detected the human beta defensin-3 in bactericidal concentrations in 
platelet preparations by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In
antimicrobial testing we demonstrated effective inhibition of Escherichia coli
(ATCC 11303), Bacterium megaterium (ATCC 14581), Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC
13883), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Proteus mirabilis (ATCC21100).
CONCLUSION: With this study we demonstrate antimicrobial action of a popular
adjunct for orthopaedic and trauma surgery against gram-positive and
gram-negative bacteria. We have identified a possible mechanism of action via the
secretion of HBD-3 as a first line defence in contaminated wounds and in elective
application of PRP. This finding supports a broader spectrum of clinical
indications for an autologous platelet preparation.
