to T cells.

Previous studies demonstrated that a human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cell line, NALM-6, failed to stimulate a primary MLR, despite expression of class
II MHC and adhesion molecules. Here we demonstrate that this is the result of the
fact that NALM-6 cells do not express the ligand for CD28, namely B7. NALM-6
transfectants that expressed high levels of B7 gained the capacity to stimulate
IL-2 production by class II MHC molecule-specific alloreactive T cells and to
costimulate a polyclonal population of purified T cells cultured with immobilized
anti-CD3 mAb. In the presence of PMA, NALM-6 cells transfected with B7
polyclonally stimulated T cells in a cyclosporine A-resistant fashion, a property
previously attributed only to agonistic anti-CD28 mAb. The gain of these
functions could not be explained solely by an increased capacity of the
transfectants to form conjugates with T cells, suggesting that the CD28/B7
interaction transduces a costimulatory signal in T cells.
