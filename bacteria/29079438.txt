The aim of this study was to immobilize of lysozyme onto bacterial cellulose
nanofibers (BCNF) using physical absorption method. Antimicrobial activity and
other properties of immobilized lysozyme and also morphological characteristics
of BCNF were studied. Activity of lysozyme was decreased about 12% after
immobilization. The lysozyme concentration of 1mg/ml was chosen for next studies 
on immobilized enzyme. The optimum pH and temperature were recorded as 7 and
45°C, respectively for immobilized enzyme. Storage stability was increased and
immobilized lysozyme exhibited more than 70% of its initial activity after 9
cycles. Kinetic parameters of Km and Vmax were 31.18μg/ml and 112.35 ΔOD/min,
respectively for immobilized enzyme. Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against
Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia
entrocolitica, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces serviseae was increased after 
immobilization. The XRD analyses showed a decrease in diffraction intensities and
crystallinity index of BCNF after immobilization of lysozyme. According to the
results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the diameter of nanofibers was
increased by lysozyme incorporation. This study demonstrates the potential for
the use of BCNF as carrier for lysozyme immobilization.
