By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry, we have
characterized the polypeptide species present in extracts obtained by 60% ethanol
treatment of whole mature (48 h) biofilms formed by a reference strain
(CAI4-URA3) and four Candida albicans null mutants for cell-wall-related genes
(ALG5, CSA1, MNN9 and PGA10) Null mutants form fragile biofilms that appeared
partially split and weakly attached to the substratum contrary to those produced 
by the reference strain. An almost identical, electrophoretic profile consisting 
of about 276 spots was visualized in all extracts examined. Proteomic analysis
led to the identification of 131 polypeptides, corresponding to 86 different
protein species, being the rest isoforms-83 displayed negative hydropathic
indexes and 82 lack signal peptide. The majority of proteins appeared at pI
between 4 and 6, and molecular mass between 10 and 94 kDa. The proteins
identified belonged to the following Gene Ontology categories: 21.9% unknown
molecular function, 16.2% oxidoreductase activity, 13.3% hydrolase activity and
41.8% distributed between other different GO categories. Strong defects in
biofilm formation appreciated in the cell-wall mutant strains could be attributed
to defects in aggregation due to abnormal cell wall formation rather than to
differences in the biofilm extracellular matrix composition.
