Infections caused by multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularly
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are increasing worldwide. In patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF), resistance in P. aeruginosa to numerous anti-pseudomonal agents is
becoming common. The absence since 1995, of new substances active against
resistant Gram-negative bacteria, has caused increasing concern. Colistin, an old
antibiotic also known as polymyxin E, has attracted more interest recently
because of its significant activity against multi-resistant P. aeruginosa,
Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the low resistance rates
to it. Because its use as an anti-pseudomonal agent was displaced by the
potentially less toxic aminoglycosides in 1970s, our knowledge of this drug is
limited. However, there has been a significant recent increase in the data
gathered on colistin, focussing on its chemistry, antibacterial activity,
mechanism of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and new
clinical application. It is likely that colistin will be an important
antimicrobial option against multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, for some
years to come.
