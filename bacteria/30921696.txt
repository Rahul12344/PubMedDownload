A potent bacterial strain capable of degrading dibenzothiophene (DBT) was
isolated and evaluated for its characteristics. The strain, designated as LKY-5, 
is rod-shaped, gram-negative, and occurs mainly in clusters. It was identified as
belonging to the Pseudomonas genus based on the 16S rDNA sequence and phylogenic 
analysis. Determination of its DBT depletion efficiency by gas chromatography
revealed that the isolate was able to completely degrade up to 100 mg L-1 DBT
within 144 h. The pH values, DBT concentrations, and biomasses in the medium
varied significantly in the initial 24 h. A biosurfactant produced by LKY-5 was
extracted and identified as a di-rhamnolipid with the formula Rha-Rha-C8-C8:1 by 
HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. There were 26 metabolites in the DBT degradation process.
Pseudomonas sp. LKY-5 exhibited unusually high DBT degradation efficiency via
multiple metabolic pathways. Compared with the reported 4S and Kodama pathways,
two more expanded metabolic pathways for the degradation of DBT are proposed. The
polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) in diesel, such as C1-DBT,
C2-DBT, C3-DBT, 4,6-DMDBT, and 2,4,6-TMDBT, can also be degraded with 28.2-42.3% 
efficiency. The results showed that LKY-5 is an excellent bacterial candidate for
the bioremediation of PASH-contaminated sites and sediments.
