Background.: We aimed to develop a teaching-learning and evaluation programme on 
communication skills for interns. Core competency areas for focused communication
skills training and assessment were identified to achieve the obective. We then
assessed the identified competencies among interns using objective structured
clinical examination (OSCE), before the start of internship.
Methods.: Five core areas for focused training and evaluation were identified on 
the basis of responses of practising physicians in local settings. OSCE stations 
were developed for evaluation based on the identified competency areas. A
pre-test OSCE was administered to 30 interns.
Results.: Five core areas selected for training and evaluation were: (i)
communicating with a parent resistant to immunization; (ii) interacting with a
patient who has psychosomatic complaints; (iii) explaining risks and procedures; 
(iv) breaking bad news; and (v) communicating with patients and bystanders in a
casualty setting. Thirty of 160 interns were selected to participate in the OSCE 
before the training (pre-test). The lowest score was for breaking bad news.
Scores indicated that explaining risks and procedures, communicating in a busy
casualty setting and dealing with psychosomatic complaints were areas that
required extensive training and practice.
Conclusions.: We were able to identify core competency areas for focused training
and evaluation of communication skills suited to the local context and used OSCE 
to evaluate the skills before the start of internship.
