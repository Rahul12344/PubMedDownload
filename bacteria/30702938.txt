Temperature-controlled supply chains (cold chains) require an unbroken chain of
refrigeration to maintain product quality and safety. This study investigated
cold chains for farmed oysters raised in the Chesapeake Bay, one of the largest
shellfish-growing regions in the United States, and sold live to the half-shell
market in surrounding states. Temperature sensors were used in boxes of oysters
from February to September 2017, which generated 5,250 h of temperature data.
Thirty-nine businesses participated in the temperature sensor study, and 26 of
those businesses participated in interviews to further understand how cold chains
function. Internal oyster temperatures were measured above 50°F (10°C) for over 1
h in 19% (7 of 36) of shipments, which is a temperature that exceeds National
Shellfish Sanitation Program criteria. The highest internal oyster temperature
recorded in any shipment was 54.5°F (12.5°C). Some parts of the cold chain had
difficulty maintaining storage temperatures below 45°F (7.2°C) in warmer months
when Vibrio control plans were in effect. We modeled the effects of temperature
on Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The model predicted moderate bacterial growth before 
oysters were under temperature control, but cold chains prevented further
bacterial growth and provided a moderate drop-off in V. parahaemolyticus
abundance.
