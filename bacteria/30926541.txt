BACKGROUND: Analysis of the molecular characteristics of isolates is very
important for clinical and epidemiological study of community-acquired pneumonia 
(CAP) caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2012, an epidemic period, M. pneumoniae was isolated
from oropharyngeal swabs of consecutive CAP patients. Minimum inhibitory
concentrations of macrolides, 23S rRNA gene sequencing, P1 gene and multilocus
variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) genotyping was conducted.
RESULTS: 88.3% (181/205) of the isolates were macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae
(MRMP) and all harbored an A2063 G mutation. The strains were clustered into 7
MLVA types, and P1 type 1 and type 2 lineages were co-circulated (86.3% and
13.7%). Compared with adults, no specific MLVA type contributed to higher M.
pneumoniae infection in children (p =  0.14). Similar macrolide profile and
genotypes of M. pneumoniae was found between outpatients and inpatients.
Significant differences in proportion of P1 types and two main MLVA types 4/5/7/2
and 3/5/6/2 were observed between MRMP and macrolide-sensitive M. pneumoniae
(MSMP) (p <  0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a comprehensive profile of M. pneumoniae
molecular characterization among CAP patients of all age, and provides more
evidences on a correlation between MLVA type 4/5/7/2 and macrolide resistance in 
the setting of high incidence of MRMP.
