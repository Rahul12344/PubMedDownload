The immunomodulatory and antitumor effects of lactic acid bacteria (LABs) were
investigated. Cytoplasmic fraction of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus
casei and Bifidobacterium longum were tested for the antiproliferative activity
in vitro to SNUC2A, SNU1, NIH/3T3 and Jurkat cell lines by crystal violet assay. 
All cytoplasmic fraction suppressed proliferation of tumor cells, though L. casei
and B. longum were more effective. From these results, cytoplasmic fraction of L.
casei and B. longum with Y400 as a control were administered as dietary
supplements to Balb/c mice for 2, and 4 consecutive wks. Administration for 4 wks
enhanced the number of total T cells, NK cells and MHC class II+ cells, and
CD4-CD8+ T cells in flow cytometry analysis. To determine of antitumor activity
of LABs preparation in vivo, F9 teratocarcinoma cells were inoculated on mice at 
14th day. Body weight was decreased with increased survival rate in all groups
with the cytoplasm of LABs. Our results showed that cytoplasmic fraction of LABs 
had direct antiproliferative effects on tumor cell lines in vitro, effects on
immune cells in vivo, and antitumor effects on tumor-bearing mice with prolonged 
survival periods.
