A novel series of antimalarial benzimidazole derivatives incorporating phenolic
Mannich base side chains at the C2 position, which possess dual asexual blood and
sexual stage activities, is presented. Structure-activity relationship studies
revealed that the 1-benzylbenzimidazole analogues possessed submicromolar asexual
blood and sexual stage activities in contrast to the 1H-benzimidazole analogues, 
which were only active against asexual blood stage (ABS) parasites. Further, the 
former demonstrated microtubule inhibitory activity in ABS parasites but more
significantly in stage II/III gametocytes. In addition to being bona fide
inhibitors of hemozoin formation, the 1H-benzimidazole analogues also showed
inhibitory effects on microtubules. In vivo efficacy studies in Plasmodium
berghei-infected mice revealed that the frontrunner compound 41 exhibited high
efficacy (98% reduction in parasitemia) when dosed orally at 4 Ã— 50 mg/kg.
Generally, the compounds were noncytotoxic to mammalian cells.
