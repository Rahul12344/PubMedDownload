Ag-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) must survive bacterial infection to present
Ag information to naive T cells. The greater ability of DCs' host defense is
evident from the report that DCs are more resistant to Listeria monocytogenes
than macrophages. However, the molecular mechanism of this resistance is unclear.
We found that Listeria replicate more slowly in wild-type DCs compared with
fascin1 knockout DCs. This finding is significant because fascin1, an
actin-bundling protein, is specifically and greatly induced upon maturation of
dendritic cells, but not other blood cells, including macrophages and
neutrophils. Infection by Listeria makes phagosomes more acidic in wild-type DCs 
than in fascin1 knockout DCs, suggesting that fascin1 facilitates phagolysosomal 
fusion for killing of phagocytosed Listeria. We further found that fascin1 binds 
to LC3, an autophagosome marker, both in vivo and in vitro. Listeria are
associated with LC3 to a greater extent in wild-type DCs than in fascin1 knockout
DCs, suggesting that fascin1 facilitates autophagy for eradication of cytoplasmic
Listeria. Taken together, our results suggest that fascin1 plays critical roles
in the survival of DCs during Listeria infection, allowing DCs to function in
innate and adaptive immunity.
