Propionibacterium acnes are gram-positive pleomorphic rods that grow under an
anaerobic condition. They are the most frequent inhabitants of sebaceous glands
of skin, hair follicles, mouth, upper respiratory tract, and as a frequent
contaminant in laboratory cultures. Propionibacterium acnes is an underestimated 
but significant cause of postneurosurgical infection, especially in the presence 
of foreign bodies such as shunt systems. We present a rare case with a
postoperative subdural empyema in which the only pathogen isolated was
Propionibacterium acnes. In our case, the clinical course was atypically rapid.
The most effective antibiotic therapy for Propionibacterium acnes infections has 
not been established. However, high dose penicillin in combination with surgical 
drainage and removal of foreign bodies is recommended as the treatment of choice.
