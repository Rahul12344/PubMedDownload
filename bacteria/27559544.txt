AIM: To examine the association of TLR4 Asp299Gly and MICA exon 5 microsatellites
polymorphisms with severity of trachoma in a sub-Saharan East Africa population
of Tanzanian villagers.
METHODS: The samples were genotyped for MICA exon 5 microsatellites and the TLR4 
299 A/G polymorphism by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and
GeneScanÂ®, respectively. The association of TLR4 Asp299Gly and MICA exon 5
microsatellites with inflammatory trachoma (TI) and trichiasis (TI) were
examined.
RESULTS: The results showed an association between TLR4 and MICA polymorphisms
and trachoma disease severity, as well as with protection. TLR4 an allele was
significantly associated with inflammatory trachoma (p=0.0410), while the G
allele (p=0.0410) was associated with protection.
CONCLUSION: TLR4 and MICA may modulate the risk of severity to trachoma disease
by modulating the immune response to Ct. In addition; the increased frequency of 
MICA-A9 heterozygote in controls may suggest a positive selection of these
alleles in adaptation to environments where Ct is endemic.
