Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a recently described homologue of the
vasoactive peptidase, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Like ACE, ACE2 is an
integral (type I) membrane zinc metallopeptidase, which exists as an ectoenzyme. 
ACE2 is less widely distributed than ACE in the body, being expressed at highest 
concentrations in the heart, kidney and testis. ACE2 also differs from ACE in its
substrate specificity, functioning exclusively as a carboxypeptidase rather than 
a peptidyl dipeptidase. A key role for ACE2 appears to be emerging in the
conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7), allowing it to act as a
counter-balance to the actions of ACE. ACE2 has been localised to the endothelial
and epithelial cells of the heart and kidney where it may have a role at the cell
surface in hydrolysing bioactive peptides such as angiotensin II present in the
circulation. A role for ACE2 in the metabolism of other biologically active
peptides also needs to be considered. ACE2 also serendipitously appears to act as
a receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Studies 
usingace2 -/- mice, and other emerging studiesin vivo andin vitro, have revealed 
that ACE2 has important functions in cardiac regulation and diabetes. Together
with its role as a SARS receptor, ACE2 is therefore likely to be an important
therapeutic target in a diverse range of disease states.
