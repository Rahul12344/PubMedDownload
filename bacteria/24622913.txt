The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) has traditionally been
performed by obtaining a history and physical exam, measuring serology, and
performing microbiology analysis of synovial fluid and tissue samples. The
measurement of serum biomarkers, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
the C-reactive protein (CRP), is routinely used to diagnose PJI. However, these
markers are elevated in all inflammatory conditions, necessitating the need for
more specific biomarkers to diagnose PJI. Serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin,
interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, short-chain exocellular
lipoteichoic acid, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 may be more specific to PJI. Synovial fluid biomarkers 
elevated in PJI include cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TNF-α,
interferon-δ, and vascular endothelial growth factor. More specific synovial
fluid biomarkers include synovial CRP, α-defensin, human β-defensin-2 (HBD-2) and
HBD-3, leukocyte esterase, and cathelicidin LL-37. These biomarkers are the
future for sensitive and specific diagnosis of PJI.
