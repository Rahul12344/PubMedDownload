Compartmentalization is an important organizational feature of life. It occurs at
varying levels of complexity ranging from eukaryotic organelles and the bacterial
microcompartments, to the molecular reaction chambers formed by enzyme
assemblies. The structural basis of enzyme encapsulation in molecular
compartments is poorly understood. Here we show, using X-ray crystallographic,
biochemical and EM experiments, that a widespread family of conserved bacterial
proteins, the linocin-like proteins, form large assemblies that function as a
minimal compartment to package enzymes. We refer to this shell-forming protein as
'encapsulin'. The crystal structure of such a particle from Thermotoga maritima
determined at 3.1-angstroms resolution reveals that 60 copies of the monomer
assemble into a thin, icosahedral shell with a diameter of 240 angstroms. The
interior of this nanocompartment is lined with conserved binding sites for short 
polypeptide tags present as C-terminal extensions of enzymes involved in
oxidative-stress response.
