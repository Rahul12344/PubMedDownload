S-layer is a self-assemble regularly crystalline surface that covers major cell
wall component of many bacteria and archaea and exhibits a high metal-binding
capacity. We have studied the effect of the calcium ions and type of solid
support (glass or mica) on the structure of the S-layers from Bacillus coagulans 
HN-68 and Bacillus thuringiensis MH14 upon simple methods based on light
microscopy and AFM. Furthermore, the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) study is indicated that the calcium-S-layer interaction occurred mainly
through the carboxylate groups of the side chains of aspartic acid (Asp) and
glutamic acid (Glu) and nitrogen atoms of Lys, Asn, and histidine (His) amino
acids and N-H groups of the peptide backbone. Studied FTIR revealed that inner
faces of S-layer are mainly negative, and outer faces of S-layer are mainly
positive. Probably, calcium ions with positive charges bound to the carboxyl
groups of Glu and Asp. Accordingly, calcium ions are anchored in the space
between the inner faces of S-layer with negative charge and the surface of mica
with negative charge. This leads to regular arrangement of the S-layer subunits.
