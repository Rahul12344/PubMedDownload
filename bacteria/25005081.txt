The hyperthermophilic glycoside hydrolase family endocellulase 12 from the
archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus (EGPf; Gene ID PF0854; EC 3.2.1.4) catalyzes the
hydrolytic cleavage of the β-1,4-glucosidic linkage in β-glucan in lignocellulose
biomass. A crystal of EGPf was previously prepared at pH 9.0 and its structure
was determined at an atomic resolution of 1.07 Å. This article reports the
crystallization of EGPf at the more physiologically relevant pH of 5.5. Structure
determination showed that this new crystal form has the symmetry of space group
C2. Two molecules of the enzyme are observed in the asymmetric unit. Crystal
packing is weak at pH 5.5 owing to two flexible interfaces between
symmetry-related molecules. Comparison of the EGPf structures obtained at pH 9.0 
and pH 5.5 reveals a significant conformational difference at the active centre
and in the surface loops. The interfaces in the vicinity of the flexible surface 
loops impact the quality of the EGPf crystal.
