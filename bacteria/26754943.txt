BACKGROUND: Malaria control strategies are focusing on new approaches, such as
the symbiotic control, which consists in the use of microbial symbionts to
prevent parasite development in the mosquito gut and to block the transmission of
the infection to humans. Several microbes, bacteria and fungi, have been proposed
for malaria or other mosquito-borne diseases control strategies. Among these, the
yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus has been recently isolated from the gut of
Anopheles mosquitoes, where it releases a natural antimicrobial toxin.
Interestingly, many environmental strains of W. anomalus exert a wide
anti-bacterial/fungal activity and some of these 'killer' yeasts are already used
in industrial applications as food and feed bio-preservation agents. Since a few 
studies showed that W. anomalus killer strains have antimicrobial effects also
against protozoan parasites, the possible anti-plasmodial activity of the yeast
was investigated.
METHODS: A yeast killer toxin (KT), purified through combined chromatographic
techniques from a W. anomalus strain isolated from the malaria vector Anopheles
stephensi, was tested as an effector molecule to target the sporogonic stages of 
the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei, in vitro. Giemsa staining was
used to detect morphological damages in zygotes/ookinetes after treatment with
the KT. Furthermore, the possible mechanism of action of the KT was investigated 
pre-incubating the protein with castanospermine, an inhibitor of β-glucanase
activity.
RESULTS: A strong anti-plasmodial effect was observed when the P. berghei
sporogonic stages were treated with KT, obtaining an inhibition percentage up to 
around 90%. Microscopy analysis revealed several ookinete alterations at
morphological and structural level, suggesting the direct implication of the
KT-enzymatic activity. Moreover, evidences of the reduction of KT activity upon
treatment with castanospermine propose a β-glucanase-mediated activity.
CONCLUSION: The results showed the in vitro killing efficacy of a protein
produced by a mosquito strain of W. anomalus against malaria parasites. Further
studies are required to test the KT activity against the sporogonic stages in
vivo, nevertheless this work opens new perspectives for the possible use of
killer strains in innovative strategies to impede the development of the malaria 
parasite in mosquito vectors by the means of microbial symbionts.
