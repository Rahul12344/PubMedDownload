FrpB is an integral outer membrane protein from the human pathogen Neisseria
meningitidis. It is a member of the TonB-dependent transporter family and
promotes the uptake of iron across the outer membrane. There is also evidence
that FrpB is an antigen and hence a potential component of a vaccine against
meningococcal meningitis. FrpB incorporating a polyhistidine tag was
overexpressed in Escherichia coli into inclusion bodies. The protein was then
solubilized in urea, refolded and purified to homogeneity. Two separate antigenic
variants of FrpB were crystallized by sitting-drop vapour diffusion. Crystals of 
the F5-1 variant diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution and belonged to space group C2,
with unit-cell parameters a = 176.5, b = 79.4, c = 75.9 Å, β = 98.3°.
Crystal-packing calculations suggested the presence of a monomer in the
asymmetric unit. Crystals of the F3-3 variant also diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution
and belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 85.3, b 
= 104.6, c = 269.1 Å. Preliminary analysis suggested the presence of an FrpB
trimer in the asymmetric unit.
