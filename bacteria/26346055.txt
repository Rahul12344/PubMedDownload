INTRODUCTION: A clinical suspicion of infection is mandatory for diagnosing
sepsis in patients with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Yet, the
accuracy of categorizing critically ill patients presenting to the intensive care
unit (ICU) as being infected or not is unknown. We therefore assessed the
likelihood of infection in patients who were treated for sepsis upon admission to
the ICU, and quantified the association between plausibility of infection and
mortality.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of critically ill patients admitted with clinically 
suspected sepsis to two tertiary ICUs in the Netherlands between January 2011 and
December 2013. The likelihood of infection was categorized as none, possible,
probable or definite by post-hoc assessment. We used multivariable competing
risks survival analyses to determine the association of the plausibility of
infection with mortality.
RESULTS: Among 2579 patients treated for sepsis, 13% had a post-hoc infection
likelihood of "none", and an additional 30% of only "possible". These percentages
were largely similar for different suspected sites of infection. In crude
analyses, the likelihood of infection was associated with increased length of
stay and complications. In multivariable analysis, patients with an unlikely
infection had a higher mortality rate compared to patients with a definite
infection (subdistribution hazard ratio 1.23; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.49).
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first prospective analysis to show that the
clinical diagnosis of sepsis upon ICU admission corresponds poorly with the
presence of infection on post-hoc assessment. A higher likelihood of infection
does not adversely influence outcome in this population.
