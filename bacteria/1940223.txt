The antibody response against Toxoplasma gondii was evaluated by ELISA and
indirect haemagglutination test (IHA) in 100 antenatal cases with bad obstetric
history. 30 per cent of the cases were found to be positive by the IgM ELISA test
and 22 per cent were positive by the IHA test. ELISA was found to be a more
specific, reliable and easy test for screening of antenatal cases.
