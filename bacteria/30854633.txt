Lyme disease is a common multisystem disease caused by infection with a
tick-transmitted spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi and related Borrelia species.
The monoglycosylated diacylglycerol known as B. burgdorferi glycolipid II
(BbGL-II) is a major target of antibodies in sera from infected individuals.
Here, we show that CD1b presents BbGL-II to human T cells and that the TCR
mediates the recognition. However, we did not detect increased frequency of
CD1b-BbGL-II binding T cells in the peripheral blood of Lyme disease patients
compared to controls. Unexpectedly, mapping the T cell specificity for
BbGL-II-like molecules using tetramers and activation assays revealed a
concomitant response to CD1b-expressing APCs in absence of BbGL-II. Further,
among all major classes of self-lipid tested, BbGL-II responsive TCRs show strong
cross-reactivity to diacylglycerol, a self-lipid antigen with structural
similarities to BbGL-II. Extending prior work on MHC and CD1b, CD1c, and CD1d
proteins, this study provides evidence for cross-reactive CD1b-restricted T cell 
responses to bacterial and self-antigens, and identifies chemically defined
targets for future discovery of self and foreign antigen cross-reactive T cells.
