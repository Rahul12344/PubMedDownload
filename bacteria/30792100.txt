Filamenting temperature-sensitive mutant Z (FtsZ) is recognized as a promising
target for new antibiotics development because of its high conservatism and
pivotal role in the bacteria cell division. The aromatic heterocyclic scaffold of
indole is known showing merit medical functions in antiviral and antimicrobial.
In the present study, a series of 1-methylquinolinium derivatives, which were
integrated with an indole fragment at its 2-position and a variety of amino
groups (cyclic or linear, mono- or di-amine) at the 4-position were synthesized
and their antibacterial activities were evaluated. The results of antibacterial
study show that the representative compounds can effectively inhibit the growth
of testing strains including MRSA and VRE, with MIC values of 1-4 μg/mL by
bactericidal mode. The mode of action assays revealed that c2 can effectively
disrupt the rate of GTP hydrolysis and dynamic polymerization of FtsZ, and thus
inhibits bacterial cell division and then causes bacterial cell death. In
addition, the result of resistance generation experiment reveals that c2 is not
likely to induce resistance in S. aureus.
