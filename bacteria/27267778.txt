The activation of TLR-MyD88 (Toll-like receptor-myeloid differentiation factor
88) signaling within T cells functions as a potent costimulatory signal that
boosts antitumor and antiviral responses. However, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the costimulatory processes are poorly understood. We compared
microarray gene analysis data between TLR1-TLR2-stimulated and unstimulated
T-cell receptor transgenic "pmel" and MyD88(-/-) pmel CD8(+) T cells and
identified changes in the expression of several TNF family members. In
particular, TLR stimulation increased 4-1BB levels in pmel but not in
MyD88(-/-)pmel T cells. A link between 4-1BB and TLR1-TLR2 signaling in CD8(+) T 
cells was highlighted by the suboptimal responses of 4-1BB(-/-) T cells to
TLR1-TLR2 agonist, but their normal response to CD28 or OX40 costimulation.
Blocking 4-1BB signaling with antibodies also hindered the costimulatory effects 
of the TLR1-TLR2 agonist. The elevated levels of 4-1BB transcripts in
TLR1-TLR2-stimulated cells were not due to increased mRNA stability nor increased
histone activation, but instead were associated with increased binding of p65 and
c-Jun to two distinct 4-1BB promoter sites. Combining TLR1-TLR2 ligand with an
agonistic antibody to 4-1BB enhanced the antitumor activity in mice with
established melanoma tumors. These studies reveal that the costimulatory effects 
of TLR1-TLR2 signaling in CD8(+) T cells are in part mediated by 4-1BB and are
important for mounting an effective antitumor immune response. Cancer Immunol
