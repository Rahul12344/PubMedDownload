Chlamydia trachomatis translocates the effector protein Tarp (translocated
actin-recruiting phosphoprotein) into the host cell cytoplasm where it is quickly
tyrosine phosphorylated. Abl and Src kinases have been implicated in Tarp
phosphorylation; however, we observed that the situation is more complex.
Chemical inhibition of Src family kinases confirmed a role for these kinases in
Tarp phosphorylation. Infection of Src, Yes, Fyn (SYF)-deficient cells showed a
dampened, but incompletely blocked, Tarp phosphorylation. Inhibition of Abl in an
SYF background still did not completely block Tarp phosphorylation. Consequently,
we tested additional kinases and found that Syk, but not Btk or Jak2, is a potent
kinase of Tarp in vitro. Inhibition of Syk in an SYF background further blocked
Tarp phosphorylation. Under these conditions, inclusion formation still proceeded
normally. These data reveal a highly promiscuous substrate property of Tarp and
set the stage for further functional characterization of Tarp phosphorylation
during host cell infection.
