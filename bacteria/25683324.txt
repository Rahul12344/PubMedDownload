Cilengitide (EMD 121974, manufactured by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is an
αv-integrin receptor antagonist showing high affinity for αvβ3 and αvβ5.This
study determined the mass balance of cilengitide in healthy volunteers receiving 
a single intravenous infusion of 2.1 MBq (14) C-cilengitide spiked into 250 mL of
2000 mg of cilengitide. Blood, urine, and feces were collected up to day 15 or
until excretion of radioactivity was below 1% of the administered dose. Total
radioactivity derived from the administration of (14) C-cilengitide and unlabeled
cilengitide levels were determined and used for calculation of pharmacokinetic
parameters.(14) C-cilengitide-related radioactivity was completely recovered
(94.5%; 87.4%-100.6%) and was mainly excreted into urine (mean, 79.0%; range,
70.3%-88.2%) and to a lesser extent into feces (mean, 15.5%; range, 9.3%-20.3%). 
Of the administered dose, 77.5% was recovered as unchanged cilengitide in urine. 
The concentration profiles of cilengitide and total radioactivity in plasma were 
comparable. No circulating metabolites were identified in plasma and urine. Two
metabolites,M606-1 and M606-2, were identified in feces considered to be formed
by intestinal peptidases or by peptidases from fecal bacteria. In conclusion, the
data show that following intravenous administration, (14) C-cilengitide was
completely recovered, was excreted mainly via renal elimination, and was not
metabolized systemically.
