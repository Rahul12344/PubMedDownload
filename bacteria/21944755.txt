ClpP is a cylindrical serine protease whose ability to degrade proteins is
regulated by the unfoldase ATP-dependent chaperones. ClpP on its own can only
degrade small peptides. Here, we used ClpP as a target in a high-throughput
screen for compounds, which activate the protease and allow it to degrade larger 
proteins, hence, abolishing the specificity arising from the ATP-dependent
chaperones. Our screen resulted in five distinct compounds, which we designate as
Activators of Self-Compartmentalizing Proteases 1 to 5 (ACP1 to 5). The compounds
are found to stabilize the ClpP double-ring structure. The ACP1 chemical
structure was considered to have drug-like characteristics and was further
optimized to give analogs with bactericidal activity. Hence, the ACPs represent
classes of compounds that can activate ClpP and that can be developed as
potential novel antibiotics.
