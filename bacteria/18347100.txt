Knockdown of the insulator factor CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), which binds XL9,
an intergenic element located between HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1, was found to
diminish expression of these genes. The mechanism involved interactions between
CTCF and class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of major
histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) gene expression, and the formation
of long-distance chromatin loops between XL9 and the proximal promoter regions of
these MHC-II genes. The interactions were inducible and dependent on the activity
of CIITA, regulatory factor X, and CTCF. RNA fluorescence in situ hybridizations 
show that both genes can be expressed simultaneously from the same chromosome.
Collectively, the results suggest a model whereby both HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci
can interact simultaneously with XL9, and describe a new regulatory mechanism for
these MHC-II genes involving the alteration of the general chromatin conformation
of the region and their regulation by CTCF.
