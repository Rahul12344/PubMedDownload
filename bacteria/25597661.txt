A plasmid transfer-mediated bioaugmentation method for the enhancement of
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) degradation in soil was developed using the
catabolic plasmid pDOD from Sphingobacterium sp. D-6. The pDOD plasmid could be
transferred to soil bacteria, such as members of Cellulomonas, to form DDT
degraders and thus accelerate DDT degradation. The transfer efficiency of pDOD
was affected by the donor, temperature, moisture, and soil type. Approximately
50.7% of the DDT in the contaminated field was removed 210 days after the
application of Escherichia coli TG I (pDOD-gfp). The results suggested that
seeding pDOD into soil is an effective bioaugmentation method for enhancing the
degradation of DDT.
