Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC-II) molecules play a pivotal role 
in the adaptive immune system because they direct the development, activation and
homeostasis of CD4+ T helper cells. Hereditary defects leading to the absence of 
MHC-II expression result in a severe autosomal recessive immunodeficiency disease
called the Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome (BLS), also referred to as MHC-II deficiency.
The genetic lesions responsible for BLS do not lie within the MHC-II locus
itself, but reside instead in genes encoding transcription factors controlling
MHC-II expression. Mutations in four different MHC-II regulatory genes are known 
to lead to BLS. These genes encode CIITA, RFXANK, RFX5 and RFXAP. CIITA (Class II
Transactivator) is a transcriptional coactivator that functions as a master
control factor dictating the cell type specificity, induction and level of MHC-II
expression. RFXANK, RFX5 and RFXAP are the three subunits of RFX (regulatory
factor X), a DNA-binding complex that binds to a conserved cis-acting sequence,
the X box, present in the promoters of all MHC-II genes. Elucidation of the
molecular defects underlying BLS has led to major advances in our understanding
of the mechanisms regulating expression of MHC-II genes.
