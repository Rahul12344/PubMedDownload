Bad pregnancy outcome includes abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, morbidity,
malformation, cerebral palsy, and mental retardation. These afflictions cause
devastating personal impact. In the United States, almost 10% of all school-aged 
children are handicapped. Neurologic and communicative disorders affect 42
million people and cost $114 billion each year. The cause of cerebral palsy is
known in less than 10% of these cases. Enormous litigations have threatened
clinicians, paramedical personnel, hospitals, and insurance carriers. The
placenta is an important potential means of establishing that fetal damage causes
bad pregnancy outcome independently of clinical care. All pathologists serve an
important role in the documentation of gross placental features and in the
procurement of appropriate light microscopic slides. Pathologic placentas are
common. Only an expert can determine whether an abnormal placenta represents the 
probable cause of bad pregnancy outcome.
