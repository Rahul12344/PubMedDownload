A simple procedure for recovering biodegradable polymer from bacterial cells has 
been developed using economical and environmentally friendly solvent or
chemicals. Recombinant bacterium, Cupriavidus necator harboring pBBR1MCS-C2
plasmid polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase gene was used for the production of
copolymer P(3HB-co-3HHx) from crude palm kernel oil (CPKO). NaOH was chosen in
this study as it could give high purity and recovery yield. Increase of NaOH
concentration had resulted in an increase of the PHA purity, but the recovery
yield had decreased. The greater improvement of PHA purity and recovery were
achieved by incubating the freeze-dried cells (10-30 g/L) in NaOH (0.1 M) for 1-3
h at 30Â°C and polishing using 20% (v/v) of ethanol. The treatment caused
negligible degradation of the molecular weight of PHA recovered from the
bacterial cells. The present review also highlights other extraction methods to
provide greater insights into economical and sustainable recovery of PHA from
bacterial cells.
