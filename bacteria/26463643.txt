BACKGROUND: Lipases are regularly used in biotechnology to catalyse the
hydrolysis of triglycerides and the synthesis of esters. Microbial lipases in
particular have been widely used in a variety of industrial applications.
However, the current commercial microbial lipases cannot meet industrial demand
due to rapid inactivation under harsh conditions. Therefore, in order to identify
more stable enzymes, we isolated novel eurythermic and thermostable lipase(s)
from Pseudomonas moraviensis M9.
METHODS: Cloning of lipM was based on Touchdown PCR and genome walking, and then 
recombinant LipM was purified by guanidine hydrochloride and the
nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins affinity chromatography. Finally, the
hydrolysis of algal oil by LipM was analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass
spectrometer, thin layer chromatography and gas chromatograph.
RESULTS: The lipM gene was first cloned from Pseudomonas moraviensis M9 via
Touchdown PCR and genome walking. Sequence analysis reveals that LipM is a member
of subfamily I.3 of lipases, and the predicted amino acid sequences of LipM has
82 % identity to lipase LipT from Pseudomonas mandelii JR-1, and 54 % identity to
lipase PML from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 and lipase Lip I.3 from Pseudomonas sp.
CR-611. LipM was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies,
and further biochemically characterized. Purified LipM differed significantly
from previously reported subfamily I.3 lipases, and was eurythermic between
10 °C-95 °C. LipM activity was enhanced by Ca(2+), Sr(2+), Mn(2+), and Ba(2+),
but sharply inhibited by Cu(2+), Zn(2+), Co(2+), Ni(2+), and EDTA. Compared with 
other lipases, LipM exhibited medium tolerance to methanol, ethanol, and
isopropanol. When applied for hydrolysis of algal oil, LipM could enrich 65.88 % 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, which include 1.25 % eicosapentaenoic acid, 17.61 % 
docosapentaenoic acid, and 47.02 % docosahexaenoic acid with derivative
glycerides containing 32.46 % diacylglycerols.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel eurythermic I.3 subfamily lipase with high tolerance and
stability was identified from Pseudomonas moraviensis and biochemically
characterized. It will not only improve our understanding of subfamily I.3
lipases, but also provides an ideal biocatalyst for the enrichment of
polyunsaturated fatty acids. Pseudomonas moraviensis have been investigated as a 
potential resource of lipases.
