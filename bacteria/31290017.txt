OBJECTIVES: The potential effect of enamel matrix derivative (EMD) on wound
healing following recession coverage surgery is still controversially discussed
in the literature. The aim of this randomised, controlled, single blinded
clinical study was, therefore, to investigate clinically and immunologically the 
potential effects of EMD on early wound healing and clinical results following
treatment of single and multiple gingival recessions by the modified coronally
advanced tunnel technique (MCAT) and subepithelial connective tissue graft
(sCTG).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 systemically healthy patients with Miller
class I, II or III single or multiple gingival recessions were treated with MCAT 
+ sCTG with or without EMD. Patients were consecutively enrolled and randomly
assigned to test or control treatment. Inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-1β,
IL-8, IL-10 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-8) were measured at baseline, 2 days
and 1 week postoperatively. The following clinical parameters were assessed at
baseline and at 6 months postoperatively: Recession Depth (RD), Recession Width
(RW), Width of Keratinized Tissue (KT) and Probing Depth (PD). Patient-reported
outcomes were analysed by means of a visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between the 2
groups in terms of inflammatory markers and patient-reported outcomes during
early wound healing. In the test group, RD was reduced from 4.0 ± 1.2 mm at
baseline to 0.9 ± 1.3 mm at 6 months (p < 0.001), while the corresponding values 
in the control group were 4.5 ± 2.0 mm at baseline and 1.0 ± 1.0 mm at 6 months, 
respectively. At 6 months, mean root coverage measured 78 ± 26% in the test group
and 77 ± 18% in the control group, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Within their limits, the present data have failed to show an
influence of EMD on the clinical and immunological parameters related to wound
healing following recession coverage surgery using MCAT and sCTG.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Early wound healing following recession coverage by means of 
MCAT and sCTG does not seem to be influenced by the additional application of
EMD.
