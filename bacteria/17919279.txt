Bacterial RNase P is composed of an RNA subunit and a single protein (encoded by 
the rnpB and rnpA genes respectively). The Bacillus subtilis rnpA knockdown
strain d7 was used to screen for functional conservation among bacterial RNase P 
proteins from a representative spectrum of bacterial subphyla. We demonstrate
conserved function of bacterial RNase P (RnpA) proteins despite low sequence
conservation. Even rnpA genes from psychrophilic and thermophilic bacteria
rescued growth of B. subtilis d7 bacteria; likewise, terminal extensions and
insertions between beta strands 2 and 3, in the so-called metal binding loop,
were compatible with RnpA function in B. subtilis. A deletion analysis of B.
subtilis RnpA defined the structural elements essential for bacterial RNase P
function in vivo. We further extended our complementation analysis in B. subtilis
strain d7 to the four individual RNase P protein subunits from three different
Archaea, as well as to human Rpp21 and Rpp29 as representatives of eukaryal RNase
P. None of these non-bacterial RNase P proteins showed any evidence of being able
to replace the B. subtilis RNase P protein in vivo, supporting the notion that
archaeal/eukaryal RNase P proteins are evolutionary unrelated to the bacterial
RnpA protein.
