OBJECTIVE: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in biological processes such
as cell differentiation, development, infection, immune response, inflammation
and tumorigenesis. We previously reported that the expression of miR-200b was
significantly increased in inflamed gingiva compared with non-inflamed gingiva.
To elucidate the roles of miR-200b in the inflamed gingiva, we have analyzed the 
effects of miR-200b on the expression of IL-6 in human gingival fibroblasts
(HGF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA and protein were extracted from HGF after
stimulation by interleukin-1β (IL-1β; 1 ng/ml) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α;
10 ng/ml) and transfected with miR-200b expression plasmid or miR-200b inhibitor.
IL-6, IL-1β, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinaseβ (IKKβ), Zinc-finger
E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels were
analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot.
RESULTS: IL-1β and TNF-α increased IL-6 mRNA and protein levels, and they were
significantly suppressed by miR-200b overexpression, whereas they were further
increased by miR-200b inhibitor in HGF. IKKβ and ZEB1 which are target genes of
miR-200b negatively regulate E-cadherin. MiR-200b suppressed the expression of
IKKβ and ZEB1 and increased E-cadherin mRNA and protein levels in HGF.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that miR-200b attenuates inflammatory response
via IKKβ and ZEB1 in periodontal tissue.
