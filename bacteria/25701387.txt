BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections are the most common nosocomial infections in
orthopedic surgery. Strategies to prevent these infections are of enormous
relevance.
OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based procedures such as hand disinfection, prophylactic
antibiotic application, hair removal with electric clippers, or preoperative
treatment of Staphyloccus aureus are listed in national and international
guidelines. Beside these measures, several scientifically not confirmed methods, 
e.g., the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis for several days or the usage 
of helmets during surgery, are still practiced. These measures are not
evidence-based and should not be performed anymore.
CONCLUSION: Only the consequent implementation of evidence-based procedures can
help prevent surgical site infections.
