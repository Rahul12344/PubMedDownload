OBJECTIVES: There are no data regarding the relationship between Helicobacter
pylori infection (Hp-I) and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of
multiple sclerosis. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the
association between active Hp-I, confirmed by histology, and CIS and to evaluate 
the impact of Hp eradication on the CIS clinical course.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a study on 48 patients with CIS and 20 matched
controls. At baseline, apart from histology, serum anti-Hp-specific IgG titer,
inflammatory mediators, and HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR genetic polymorphisms were
estimated. Hp-positive patients received standard triple eradication regimen, and
all patients were followed up for 2 years.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Hp-I was significantly higher in patients with CIS
(43/48, 89.6%) than in control (10/20, 50%) (P < 0.001, OR: 8.6, 95% CI:
2.4-30.8). When compared with controls, patients with CIS also showed
significantly higher serum anti-Hp IgG titer and HLA-A26, HLA-A30, and HLA-B57
frequencies. Hp-positive patients also showed higher serum concentrations of
inflammatory cytokines and homocysteine. At 2-year clinical endpoint, in the
subgroup of CIS patients with successful Hp eradication, the number of patients
who presented with a second episode was significantly lower accompanied by
significant improvement in mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score.
CONCLUSIONS: Hp-I seems more frequent in a Greek CIS cohort and its eradication
might delay CIS progression, suggesting a possible link between Hp-I and CIS.
