Infant gut-associated bifidobacteria has a metabolic pathway that specifically
utilizes lacto-N-biose I (Gal-β1,3-GlcNAc) and galacto-N-biose (Gal-β1,3-GalNAc) 
from human milk and mucin glycans. UDP-glucose 4-epimerase (GalE) from
Bifidobacterium longum (bGalE) catalyzes epimerization reactions of UDP-Gal into 
UDP-Glc and UDP-GalNAc into UDP-GlcNAc with the same level of activity that is
required to send galacto-hexoses into glycolysis. Here, we determined the crystal
structures of bGalE in three ternary complex forms: NAD+/UDP, NAD+/UDP-GlcNAc,
and NAD+/UDP-Glc. The broad specificity of bGalE was explained by structural
features of the binding pocket for the N-acetyl or C2 hydroxy group of the
substrate. Asn200 is located in a pocket of the C2 group, and its side chain
adopts different conformations in the complex structures with UDP-Glc and
UDP-GlcNAc. On the other side, Cys299 forms a large pocket for the C5 sugar ring 
atom. The flexible C2 pocket and the large C5 pocket of bGalE are suitable for
accommodating both the hydroxy and N-acetyl groups of the substrate during sugar 
ring rotation in the catalytic cycle. The substrate specificity and active site
structure of bGalE were distinct from those of Esherichia coli GalE but similar
to those of human GalE.
