Human dendritic cells (DCs) develop from progressively restricted bone marrow
(BM) progenitors: these progenitor cells include granulocyte, monocyte and DC
progenitor (GMDP) cells; monocyte and DC progenitor (MDP) cells; and common DC
progenitor (CDP) and DC precursor (pre-DC) cells. These four DC progenitors can
be defined on the basis of the expression of surface markers such as CD34 and
hematopoietin receptors. In this protocol, we describe five multiparametric flow 
cytometry panels that can be used as a tool (i) to simultaneously detect or
phenotype the four DC progenitors, (ii) to isolate DC progenitors to enable in
vitro differentiation or (iii) to assess the in vitro differentiation and
proliferation of DC progenitors. The entire procedure from isolation of cells to 
flow cytometry can be completed in 3-7 h. This protocol provides optimized
antibody panels, as well as gating strategies, for immunostaining of BM and cord 
blood specimens to study human DC hematopoiesis in health, disease and vaccine
settings.
