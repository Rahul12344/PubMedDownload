Francisella tularensis (FT), a highly infectious pathogen, is considered to be a 
potential biological weapon owing to the current lack of a human vaccine against 
it. Tul4 and FopA, both outer membrane proteins of FT, play an important role in 
the bacterium's immunogenicity. In the present study, we evaluated the immune
response of mice-humanized with human CD34+ cells (hu-mice)-to a cocktail of
recombinant Tul4 and FopA (rTul4 and rFopA), which were codon-optimized and
expressed in Escherichia coli. Not only did the cocktail-immunized hu-mice
produce a significant human immunoglobulin response, they also exhibited
prolonged survival against an attenuated live vaccine strain as well as human T
cells in the spleen. These results suggest that the cocktail of rTul4 and rFopA
had successfully induced an immune response in the hu-mice, demonstrating the
potential of this mouse model for use in the evaluation of FT vaccine candidates.
