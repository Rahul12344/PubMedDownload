The impacts of arsenic co-contamination on the natural breakdown of
1,1,l1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) in soil are investigated in 
a study of 12 former cattle dip sites located in northeastern NSW, Australia.
This study examines the relationship between the intrinsic breakdown of DDT to
1,1 -dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD) and
1,l-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), and the impacts of arsenic
co-contamination on this breakdown. Between-site analysis demonstrated that
arsenic at 2000 mg/kg gave a 50% reduction in the concentration of DDD compared
to background arsenic of 5 mg/kg.Within-site analysis also showed the ratio of
DDT:DDD increased in soils as arsenic concentrations increased. This within-site 
trend was also apparent with the DDT:DDE ratio, suggesting inhibition of DDT
breakdown by arsenic co-contamination. Microbial activity was inhibited as
residues of total DDTs and arsenic increased. Hence arsenic co-contamination and 
high concentrations of DDT in soil may result in an increased persistence of DDT 
in the environment studied.
