BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the cumulative incidence of
invasive candidiasis (IC) in intensive care units (ICUs) in Europe.
METHODS: A multinational, multicenter, retrospective study was conducted in 23
ICUs in 9 European countries, representing the first phase of the
candidemia/intra-abdominal candidiasis in European ICU project (EUCANDICU).
RESULTS: During the study period, 570 episodes of ICU-acquired IC were observed, 
with a cumulative incidence of 7.07 episodes per 1000 ICU admissions, with
important between-center variability. Separated, non-mutually exclusive
cumulative incidences of candidemia and IAC were 5.52 and 1.84 episodes per 1000 
ICU admissions, respectively. Crude 30-day mortality was 42%. Age (odds ratio
[OR] 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.02-1.06, p < 0.001), severe hepatic failure (OR
3.25, 95% 1.31-8.08, p 0.011), SOFA score at the onset of IC (OR 1.11 per point, 
95% CI 1.04-1.17, p 0.001), and septic shock (OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.24-3.63, p 0.006)
were associated with increased 30-day mortality in a secondary, exploratory
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of IC in 23 European ICUs was 7.07 episodes
per 1000 ICU admissions. Future in-depth analyses will allow explaining part of
the observed between-center variability, with the ultimate aim of helping to
improve local infection control and antifungal stewardship projects and
interventions.
