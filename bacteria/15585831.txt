Despite the clear functional importance of CD28 costimulation, the signaling
pathways transduced through CD28 have remained controversial. PI3K was identified
early as a candidate for CD28 signaling, but conflicting data during the past
decade has left the role of PI3K unresolved. In this report, we have resolved
this controversy. We show that mutation of the PI3K interaction site in the
cytosolic tail of CD28 site disrupts the ability of CD28 to recruit protein
kinase C-theta; to the central supramolecular activation cluster (c-SMAC) region 
of the immunological synapse, promote NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, and
enhance IL-2 gene transcription. In contrast, mutation of the PI3K interaction
site had no effect on the ability of CD28 to enhance IL-2 mRNA stability. These
results suggest that two distinct pathways mediate CD28-induced up-regulation of 
IL-2 expression, a PI3K-dependent pathway that may function through the
immunological synapse to enhance IL-2 transcription and a PI3K-independent
pathway that induces IL-2 mRNA stability.
