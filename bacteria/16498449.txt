The newly described CATERPILLER family (also known as NOD-LRR or NACHT-LRR) is
comprised of proteins with a nucleotide-binding domain and a leucine-rich region.
This family has gained rapid prominence because of its demonstrated and
anticipated roles in immunity, cell death and growth, and diseases. CATERPILLER
proteins are structurally similar to a subgroup of plant-disease-resistance (R)
proteins and to the apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1). They provide 
positive and negative signals for the control of immune and inflammatory
responses, and might represent intracellular sensors of pathogen products. Most
importantly, they are genetically linked to several human immunological
disorders.
