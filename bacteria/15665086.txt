The CD1 family of proteins binds self and foreign glycolipids for presentation to
CD1-restricted T cells. To identify previously uncharacterized active CD1
ligands, especially those of microbial origin, numerous glycolipids were
synthesized and tested for their ability to stimulate mouse and human natural
killer T (NKT) cells. They included analogs of the well known NKT cell agonist
alpha-galactosyl ceramide (alpha-GalCer), bacterial glycolipids, and variations
of the self-glycolipid, sulfatide. Bacterial glycolipids,
alpha-galacturonosyl-ceramides from Sphingomonas wittichii, although structurally
similar to alpha-GalCer, have significant differences in the sugar head group as 
well as the ceramide portion. The Sphingomonas glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and
sulfatide variants were shown to activate human NKT cells as measured by IL-4 and
IFN-gamma secretion. Moreover, CD1d-dimer staining revealed human NKT cell
reactivity toward these GSLs and to the sulfatides in a fashion comparable with
alpha-GalCer. Because alpha-GalCer is a marine-sponge-derived ligand, our study
here shows that bacterium-derived antigens are also able to stimulate mouse and
human NKT cells.
