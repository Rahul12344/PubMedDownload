Hypoxia, the reduction of oxygen levels in cells or tissues, elicits a set of
genes to adjust physiological and pathological demands during normal development 
and cancer progression. OCT4, a homeobox transcription factor, is essential for
self-renewal of embryonic stem cells, but little is known about the role of OCT4 
in non-germ-cell tumorigenesis. Here, we report that hypoxia stimulates a short
isoform of OCT4, called OCT4B, via a HIF2α-dependent pathway to induce the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and facilitate cancer dissemination.
OCT4B overexpression decreased epithelial barrier properties, which led to an
increase in cell migration and invasion in lung cancer cells. OCT4B knockdown
attenuated HIF2α-induced EMT and inhibited cancer dissemination in cell-line and 
animal models. We observed that OCT4B bound the SLUG promoter and enhanced its
expression, and SLUG silencing inhibited OCT4B-mediated EMT, accompanied with
decreased cell migration and invasion. Correlation analysis revealed that OCT4B
expression was significantly associated with the SLUG level in lung tumors. These
results provide novel insights into OCT4B-mediated oncogenesis in cancer
dissemination.
