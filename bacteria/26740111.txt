Preterm birth (PTB) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Although intra-amniotic infection is a recognized cause of spontaneous
preterm labor, the noninfection-related etiologies are poorly understood. In this
article, we demonstrated that the expansion of activated CD1d-restricted
invariant NKT (iNKT) cells in the third trimester by administration of
α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) induced late PTB and neonatal mortality. In vivo 
imaging revealed that fetuses from mice that underwent α-GalCer-induced late PTB 
had bradycardia and died shortly after delivery. Yet, administration of α-GalCer 
in the second trimester did not cause pregnancy loss. Peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ activation, through rosiglitazone
treatment, reduced the rate of α-GalCer-induced late PTB and improved neonatal
survival. Administration of α-GalCer in the third trimester suppressed PPARγ
activation, as shown by the downregulation of Fabp4 and Fatp4 in myometrial and
decidual tissues, respectively; this suppression was rescued by rosiglitazone
treatment. Administration of α-GalCer in the third trimester induced an increase 
in the activation of conventional CD4(+) T cells in myometrial tissues and the
infiltration of activated macrophages, neutrophils, and mature dendritic cells to
myometrial and/or decidual tissues. All of these effects were blunted after
rosiglitazone treatment. Administration of α-GalCer also upregulated the
expression of inflammatory genes at the maternal-fetal interface and
systemically, and rosiglitazone treatment partially attenuated these responses.
Finally, an increased infiltration of activated iNKT-like cells in human decidual
tissues is associated with noninfection-related preterm labor/birth.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that iNKT cell activation in vivo leads
to late PTB by initiating innate and adaptive immune responses and suggest that
the PPARγ pathway has potential as a target for prevention of this syndrome.
