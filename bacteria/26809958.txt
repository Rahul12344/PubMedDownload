OBJECTIVE: Pituitary adenomas are benign neoplasms that display invasive
behavior-a characteristic traditionally associated with malignancy-through an
ill-defined mechanism. The role of angiogenesis-related molecules in this
pathological condition remains perplexing. Our purpose is to assess the impact of
endocan (endothelial cell specific molecule-1, ESM-1), CD34 and CD105 on
pituitary adenoma invasion.
METHODS: In this study, immunohistochemical analyses for endocan, CD34 and CD105 
were performed on paraffin-embedded samples of 66 pituitary adenomas, five normal
pituitaries, and five primary hepatic carcinomas. Knosp tumor grades based on
magnetic resonance imaging coronal scanning were used to assess the invasiveness 
of each sample. The associations between endocan expression, CD34/CD105-positive 
microvessel densities (MVDs), and Knosp tumor invasion grades were evaluated.
RESULTS: These results showed that endocan protein expression in tumor cells
(TCs) was higher than that in endothelial cells (ECs) and strongly correlated
with Knosp grades (P < 0.001, Spearman's r = 0.616). Moreover, while
endocan-positive TCs localized around the blood vessels in adenomas with higher
Knosp grades, no significant association was found between CD34/CD105-MVDs and
Knosp grades (CD34: P = 0.256, r = 0.142; CD105: P = 0.183, r = 0.166). Normal
pituitary seemed to exhibit lower endocan expression and contained more
CD34/CD105-MVDs than pituitary adenomas.
CONCLUSION: Endocan expresses in both TCs and ECs of pituitary adenoma. Endocan
overexpression in TCs more accurately reflects invasiveness compared to that of
CD34/CD105-MVDs and that angiogenesis may not be the primary driver of
endocan-medicated pituitary adenoma invasion.
