DDT: inhibition of sodium chloride tolerance by the blue-green alga Anacystis
nidulans.

Batterton JC, Boush GM, Matsumura F.

Anacystis nidulans, a freshwater blue-green alga, has been found to lerate sodium
chloride (1 percent by weight) and DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis chlorophenyl)
ethane] (800 parts per billion) separately, but growth was inhibited in the
presence of both compounds. This inhibition was reversed by an increased calcium 
concentration. It is possible that inhibition of (Na+,K+)-activated adenosine
triphosphatase) by DDT causes this species to lose the ability to lerate sodium
chloride.
