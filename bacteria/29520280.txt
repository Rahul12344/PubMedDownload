Vaccination with CD1d-binding glycolipid adjuvants and co-administered protein,
lipid, and carbohydrate antigens leads to invariant natural killer T (NKT)
cell-dependent enhancement of protective B cell responses. NKT cell activation
boosts the establishment of protein antigen-specific B cell memory and long-lived
plasma cell (LLPC) compartments. NKT cells may exert a similar effect on some
carbohydrate-specific B cells, but not lipid-specific B cells. The mechanisms of 
action of NKT cells on B cell responsiveness and subsequent differentiation into 
memory B cells and LLPC is dependent on CD1d expression by dendritic cells and B 
cells that can co-present glycolipids on CD1d and antigen-derived peptide on
MHCII. CD1d/glycolipid-activated NKT cells are able to provide help to B cells in
a manner dependent on cognate and non-cognate interactions. More recently, a
glycolipid-expanded subset of IL-21-secreting NKT cells known as NKT follicular
helper cells has been suggested to be a driver of NKT-enhanced humoral immunity. 
This review summarizes established and recent findings on how NKT cells impact
humoral immunity and suggests possible areas of investigation that may allow the 
incorporation of NKT-activating agents into vaccine adjuvant platforms.
