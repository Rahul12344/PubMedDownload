The oncoprotein Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is
overexpressed in most malignancies and is an obvious candidate target protein for
future cancer therapies. However, the physiological importance of CIP2A-mediated 
PP2A inhibition is largely unknown. As PP2A regulates immune responses, we
investigated the role of CIP2A in normal immune system development and during
immune response in vivo. We show that CIP2A-deficient mice (CIP2AHOZ) present a
normal immune system development and function in unchallenged conditions. However
when challenged with Listeria monocytogenes, CIP2AHOZ mice display an impaired
adaptive immune response that is combined with decreased frequency of both CD4+
T-cells and CD8+ effector T-cells. Importantly, the cell autonomous effect of
CIP2A deficiency for T-cell activation was confirmed. Induction of CIP2A
expression during T-cell activation was dependent on Zap70 activity. Thus, we
reveal CIP2A as a hitherto unrecognized mediator of T-cell activation during
adaptive immune response. These results also reveal CIP2AHOZ as a possible novel 
mouse model for studying the role of PP2A activity in immune regulation. On the
other hand, the results also indicate that CIP2A targeting cancer therapies would
not cause serious immunological side-effects.
