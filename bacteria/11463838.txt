Ankyrin repeats are well-known structural modules that mediate interactions
between a wide spectrum of proteins. The regulatory factor X with ankyrin repeats
(RFXANK) is a subunit of a tripartite RFX complex that assembles on promoters of 
major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) genes. Although it is known
that RFXANK plays a central role in the nucleation of RFX, it was not clear how
its ankyrin repeats mediate the interactions within the complex and with other
proteins. To answer this question, we modeled the RFXANK protein and determined
the variable residues of the ankyrin repeats that should contact other proteins. 
Site-directed alanine mutagenesis of these residues together with in vitro and in
vivo binding studies elucidated how RFXAP and CIITA, which simultaneously
interact with RFXANK in vivo, bind to two opposite faces of its ankyrin repeats. 
Moreover, the binding of RFXAP requires two separate surfaces on RFXANK. One of
them, which is located in the ankyrin groove, is severely affected in the FZA
patient with the bare lymphocyte syndrome. This genetic disease blocks the
expression of MHC II molecules on the surface of B cells. By pinpointing the
interacting residues of the ankyrin repeats of RFXANK, the mechanism of this
subtype of severe combined immunodeficiency was revealed.
