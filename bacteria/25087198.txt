BACKGROUND: Group A streptococci (GAS) cause infections with a high prevalence in
most developing countries. A GAS vaccine under trial that is based on the
amino-terminus of the M protein provides type-specific immunity, and hence seems 
ineffective in India because of heterogeneous emm types. However, the conserved
C-terminal region of the M protein protects against multiple serotypes. In this
paper, the immune response generated against the conserved C-repeat region of the
M protein was checked in an Indian population to establish their vaccine
candidature.
METHODS: When screened for GAS, patients with pharyngitis, rheumatic
fever/rheumatic heart disease (RF/RHD), and invasive disease showed heterogeneous
emm types, out of which five prevalent types (1-2, 11, 49, 75 and 112) were
selected for the study. The C-terminal region of their M proteins showed
conserved C1-, C2-, and C3-repeats. The C1-repeat was more diverse and had two
different J14-like sequences. Peptides to these C-terminal regions (J14.1 and
J14-R6) were designed. Antibodies against these peptides were analyzed using the 
sera of 130 GAS-infected volunteers.
RESULTS: Serum antibodies were significantly higher in patients with acute
rheumatic fever, RHD, and invasive disease than in patients with pharyngitis or
the healthy controls. The serum antibodies to these peptides was higher in
teenagers and adults than in children.
CONCLUSION: Results showed an association between streptococcal disease
progression and the age-related development of immunity to the conserved regions.
Hence, these peptides could be considered protective in impeding streptococcal
infections worldwide.
