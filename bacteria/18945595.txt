The role of clinically important multidrug resistance (MDR) efflux pumps in
bacterial resistance to various human antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including
cathelicidin LL-37, the alpha-defensins human neutrophil peptides (HNPs)-1-3 and 
HD-5 and the beta-defensins hBD-2 and -3, was investigated. AMP susceptibility
testing was performed by killing assays and standard minimal inhibitory
concentration assays. AMP susceptibility was determined in Escherichia coli and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains overexpressing resistance-nodulation-cell division
(RND)-type pumps AcrAB and MexAB, respectively, and in their pump-deficient
parental strains. Furthermore, the impact of a member of the major facilitator
(MF) efflux pump family was investigated in Staphylococcus aureus overexpressing 
NorA and in wild-type strains. The E. coli AcrAB and P. aeruginosa MexAB RND-type
efflux pumps as well as the S. aureus NorA MF efflux pump were unable to confer
resistance to AMPs. These findings do not support a critical role of MDR efflux
pumps in the tested pathogens as a strategy to increase virulence by
circumventing the antimicrobial action of innate defence AMPs.
