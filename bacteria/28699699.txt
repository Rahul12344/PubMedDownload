It has been recognized that the cholinergic and adenosinergic systems have an
essential role in immune and inflammatory responses during bacterial fish
pathogens, such as the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and adenosine
deaminase (ADA), which are responsible for catalysis of the anti-inflammatory
molecules acetylcholine (ACh) and adenosine (Ado) respectively. Thus, the aim of 
this study was to investigate the involvement of the cholinergic and
adenosinergic systems on the immune response and inflammatory process in gills of
experimentally infected Rhamdia quelen with Streptococcus agalactiae.
Acetylcholinesterase activity decreased, while ACh levels increased in gills of
infected animals compared to uninfected animals. On the other hand, a significant
increase in ADA activity with a concomitant decrease in Ado levels was observed
in infected animals compared to uninfected animals. Based on this evidence, we
concluded that infection by S. agalactiae in silver catfish alters the
cholinergic and adenosinergic systems, suggesting the involvement of AChE and ADA
activities on immune and inflammatory responses, regulating the ACh and Ado
levels. In summary, the downregulation of AChE activity exerts an
anti-inflammatory profile in an attempt to reduce or prevent the tissue damage,
while the upregulation of ADA activity exerts a pro-inflammatory profile,
contributing to disease pathophysiology.
