G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases (GRKs) are responsible for initiating
desensitization of activated GPCRs. GRK5 is potently inhibited by the
calcium-sensing protein calmodulin (CaM), which leads to nuclear translocation of
GRK5 and promotion of cardiac hypertrophy. Herein, we report the architecture of 
the Ca2+·CaM-GRK5 complex determined by small-angle X-ray scattering and
negative-stain electron microscopy. Ca2+·CaM binds primarily to the small lobe of
the kinase domain of GRK5 near elements critical for receptor interaction and
membrane association, thereby inhibiting receptor phosphorylation while
activating the kinase for phosphorylation of soluble substrates. To define the
role of each lobe of Ca2+·CaM, we utilized the natural product malbrancheamide as
a chemical probe to show that the C-terminal lobe of Ca2+·CaM regulates membrane 
binding while the N-terminal lobe regulates receptor phosphorylation and kinase
domain activation. In cells, malbrancheamide attenuated GRK5 nuclear
translocation and effectively blocked the hypertrophic response, demonstrating
the utility of this natural product and its derivatives in probing
Ca2+·CaM-dependent hypertrophy.
