Interleukin-22 (IL-22) plays a critical role in mucosal defense, although the
molecular mechanisms that ensure IL-22 tissue distribution remain poorly
understood. We show that the CXCL16-CXCR6 chemokine-chemokine receptor axis
regulated group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) diversity and function. CXCL16 was 
constitutively expressed by CX3CR1(+) intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) and
coexpressed with IL-23 after Citrobacter rodentium infection. Intestinal ILC3s
expressed CXCR6 and its ablation generated a selective loss of the NKp46(+) ILC3 
subset, a depletion of intestinal IL-22, and the inability to control
C. rodentium infection. CD4(+) ILC3s were unaffected by CXCR6 deficiency and
remained clustered within lymphoid follicles. In contrast, the lamina propria of 
Cxcr6(-/-) mice was devoid of ILC3s. The loss of ILC3-dependent IL-22 epithelial 
stimulation reduced antimicrobial peptide expression that explained the
sensitivity of Cxcr6(-/-) mice to C. rodentium. Our results delineate a critical 
CXCL16-CXCR6 crosstalk that coordinates the intestinal topography of IL-22
secretion required for mucosal defense.
