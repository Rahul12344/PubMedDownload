Background: The ST131 Escherichia coli clone is associated with the global
dissemination of ESBLs. It has been hypothesized that ST131 could take advantage 
of better colonizing abilities. However, the data on colonization prevalence of
ESBL-ST131 in European hospitals are scarce.
Objectives: To assess the prevalence of the ST131 clone and its microbiological
characteristics among colonizing ESBL-producing E. coli (ESBL-Ec) from
hospitalized patients in four European hospitals (Berlin, Geneva, Madrid and
Utrecht) during the R-GNOSIS study.
Methods: ESBL-Ec isolates (n = 688) were obtained from rectal swabs of
hospitalized patients from March 2014 to February 2015 using selective media. The
ST131 clone and its subclones were sought using PCR and positive isolates were
further studied. blaESBL genes were characterized (PCR and sequencing),
antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed, clonal relationships were
studied by PFGE and fimH allele and O type (PCR) were assessed.
Results: ST131 prevalence was 20.5% (141/688); C1/H30R1 isolates were
significantly more prevalent in Geneva (49%) and C2/H30Rx in Madrid (67%).
C1/H30R1 isolates showed less resistance to amikacin than C2/H30Rx (4% versus
35%) and all were susceptible to penicillin/inhibitor combinations. CTX-M-15 was 
the most common enzyme (49%) followed by CTX-M-27 (27%). C1/H30R1 isolates were
significantly associated with CTX-M-27 (72%) and all of these isolates belonged
to the C1-M27 clade. Moreover, C2/H30Rx isolates and CTX-M-15 were also
significantly related (88%).
Conclusions: The predominance of C2/H30Rx-CTX-M-15 in Madrid and
C1/H30R1-CTX-M-27 in Geneva demonstrates a changing epidemiology of ESBLs in
Europe caused by ST131 subclones; in particular, the emergence of the C1-M27
clade in Europe.
