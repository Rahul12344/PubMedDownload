Arsenite resistance in bacteria is mediated by an efflux pump composed of the
arsA and arsB gene products. We have isolated the human homolog of the bacterial 
arsA (hARSA-I), a member of the ATPase superfamily with no transmembrane domain. 
Southern and Northern analyses indicated the presence of two cross-hybridizing
genes in the human genome and expression of hARSA-I in many tissues. A rabbit
antiserum raised against a glutathione-S-transferase (GST)/hARSA-I fusion protein
identified two cross-reacting proteins of 37 and 42 kDa by Western analysis in
two different human cell lines. Overexpression of hARSA-I in the embryonal human 
kidney 293 cell line was accompanied by overproduction of the 37-kDa protein
Biochemical analysis using the GST/hARSA-I fusion protein indicated that hARSA-I 
is an ATPase analogous to the bacterial ArsA. Thus, hARSA-I is a new eukaryotic
member of a highly conserved ATP-binding superfamily of proteins.
