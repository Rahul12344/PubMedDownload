We present here an in vivo view of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
II promoter assembly, nucleosome modifications and gene expression mediated by
the class II transactivator (CIITA). Acetylation and deacetylation of histones H3
and H4 at the HLA-DRA promoter were found to occur during a time-course that
depended on CIITA expression and binding. Expression of a CIITA mutant, which
lacked the activation domain, induced H4 but not H3 histone acetylation. This
suggested that multiple histone acetyltransferase activities are associated with 
MHC class II expression. H4 acetylation was mapped to Lys8, which implicated
several histone acetyltransferases as possible modulators of this activity.
