This paper reports the expression of an artificial functional polypeptide in
bacteria. The gene of a designed 24-residue DDT-binding polypeptide (DBP) was
inserted between the BamHI and PstI cleavage sites of plasmid pUR291. The hybrid 
plasmid, pUR291-DBP, was cloned in Escherichia coli JM109. After induction by
isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside a fusion protein was expressed in which
DBP was linked to the COOH-terminus of beta-galactosidase. DBP, which is stable
to trypsin, was obtained by tryptic digestion of the fusion protein and
subsequent fractionation of the tryptic peptides by reversed-phase h.p.l.c.
Recombinant and chemically synthesized DBP showed identical chromatographic
properties, amino acid composition, and chymotryptic digestion patterns. Both the
beta-galactosidase-DBP fusion and isolated recombinant DBP bound DDT. The fusion 
protein was 25 times as potent as the designed 24-residue DBP in activating a
cytochrome P-450 model system using equimolar catalytic amounts of the two
proteins.
