BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The porcine enamel matrix derivative, EMD(®), which is 
the active component of Emdogain(®), is used widely in periodontics because of
its ability to promote the regeneration of soft and hard tissues and to reduce
inflammation. Previous studies have used indirect methods to explain its
angiogenic and proliferative effects on cells associated with wound healing. In
this study we used proteomic techniques to identify proteins in EMD other than
amelogenins.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Proteins in EMD were separated by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and were identified using mass spectrometry. Proteomic results
were validated by western blot analysis of Emdogain.
RESULTS: Fourteen proteins of porcine origin were identified and included the
serine and cysteine proteinase inhibitors alpha1-antichymotrypsin and fetuin A,
respectively. Alpha1-antichymotrypsin is an acute-phase factor that has been
reported to indirectly down-regulate the expression of the gelatinase MMP-9.
Fetuin A, a major glycoprotein component of bone and teeth, is a potent inhibitor
of ectopic calcification of vascular and soft tissues and has been implicated in 
both osteogenesis and bone resorption. It also facilitates plasma membrane repair
in damaged fibroblasts.
CONCLUSION: EMD contains a number of high-molecular-weight compounds which
include the proteinase inhibitors, fetuin A and alpha1-antichymotrypsin.
