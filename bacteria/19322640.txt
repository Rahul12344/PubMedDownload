Prion protein (PrP) interacts with some kringle domain-containing proteins.
Kringle domains serve as binding domains in the interaction with PrP. The
structural conservation among kringle domains leads to the hypothesis that any
protein containing these domains can interact with PrP and be involved in prion
pathogenesis. Because prion pathogenesis occurs in the brain, kringle
domain-containing proteins should be available in the same tissue if they are
relevant to prion pathogenesis. However, gene expression of these proteins in
brains infected by prions has not been examined. Here, we showed that plasminogen
(plg), urokinase type plasminogen activator (upa), tissue type plasminogen
activator (tpa), prothrombin (prothr), and hepatocyte growth factor (hgf) genes
were expressed in murine brains and neuroblastoma cells. The changes in upa,
prothr, and hgf gene expression correlated with prion disease, but those in plg
and tpa gene expression did not. Our data suggest association of gene expression 
of kringle domain-containing proteins in brains with prion disease.
