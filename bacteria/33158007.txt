Antibody responses that correlated with reduced risk of HIV acquisition in the
RV144 efficacy trial were assessed in healthy African volunteers who had been
primed three times with HIV-DNA (subtype A, B, C) and then randomized into two
groups; group 1 was boosted twice with HIV-MVA (CRF01_AE) and group 2 with the
same HIV-MVA coadministered with subtype C envelope (Env) protein
(CN54rgp140/GLA-AF). The fine specificity of plasma Env-specific antibody
responses was mapped after the final vaccination using linear peptide microarray 
technology. Binding IgG antibodies to the V1V2 loop in CRF01_AE and subtype C Env
and Env-specific IgA antibodies were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Functional antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-mediating
antibody responses were measured using luciferase assay. Mapping of linear
epitopes within HIV-1 Env demonstrated strong targeting of the V1V2, V3, and the 
immunodominant region in gp41 in both groups, with additional recognition of two 
epitopes located in the C2 and C4 regions in group 2. A high frequency of
V1V2-specific binding IgG antibody responses was detected to CRF01_AE (77%) and
subtype C antigens (65%). In conclusion, coadministration of CN54rgp140/GLA-AF
with HIV-MVA did not increase the frequency, breadth, or magnitude of anti-V1V2
responses or ADCC-mediating antibodies induced by boosting with HIV-MVA alone.
