The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein SEC14p is required for Golgi function and
cell viability in vivo. This requirement is obviated by mutations that
specifically inactivate the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine
biosynthesis. The biochemical basis for the in vivo relationship between SEC14p
function and the CDP-choline pathway has remained obscure. We now report that
SEC14p effects an in vivo depression of CDP-choline pathway activity by
inhibiting choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (CCTase; EC 2.7.7.15), the
rate-determining enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway. Moreover, this
SEC14p-mediated inhibition of CCTase was recapitulated in vitro and was
saturable. Finally, whereas the SEC14p-dependent inhibition of CCTase in vitro
was markedly reduced under assay conditions that were expected to increase levels
of phosphatidylinositol-bound SEC14p, assay conditions expected to increase
levels of phosphatidylcholine-bound SEC14p resulted in significant potentiation
of CCTase inhibition. The collective data suggest that the
phosphatidylcholine-bound form of SEC14p effects an essential repression of
CDP-choline pathway activity in Golgi membranes by inhibiting CCTase and that the
phospholipid-binding/exchange activity of SEC14p represents a mechanism by which 
the regulatory activity of SEC14p is itself controlled.
