Immune dysregulation is a hallmark of patients infected by SARS-CoV2 and the
balance between immune reactivity and tolerance is a key determinant of all
stages of infection, including the excessive inflammatory state causing the acute
respiratory distress syndrome. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan (Trp)
metabolism is activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and drives mechanisms of
immune tolerance. We examined the state of activation of the KP by measuring the 
Kyn:Trp ratio in the serum of healthy subjects (n = 239), and SARS-CoV2-negative 
(n = 305) and -positive patients (n = 89). Patients were recruited at the
Emergency Room of St. Andrea Hospital (Rome, Italy). Kyn and Trp serum levels
were assessed by HPLC/MS-MS. Compared to healthy controls, both
SARS-CoV2-negative and -positive patients showed an increase in the Kyn:Trp
ratio. The increase was larger in SARS-CoV2-positive patients, with a significant
difference between SARS-CoV2-positive and -negative patients. In addition, the
increase was more prominent in males, and positively correlated with age and
severity of SARS-CoV2 infection, categorized as follows: 1 = no need for
intensive care unit (ICU); 2 ≤ 3 weeks spent in ICU; 3 ≥ 3 weeks spent in ICU;
and 4 = death. The highest Kyn:Trp values were found in SARS-CoV2-positive
patients with severe lymphopenia. These findings suggest that the Kyn:Trp ratio
reflects the level of inflammation associated with SARS-CoV2 infection, and,
therefore, might represent a valuable biomarker for therapeutic intervention.
