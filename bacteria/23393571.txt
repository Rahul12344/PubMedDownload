Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) plays an important role in integrating
the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and CD28 signals to achieve efficient NF-κB
activation. PDK1 is also an important regulator of T cell development, mediating 
pre-TCR induced proliferation signals. However, the role of PDK1 in B cell
antigen receptor (BCR) signaling and B cell development remains largely unknown. 
In this study we provide genetic evidence supporting the role of PDK1 in B cell
survival. We found PDK1 is required for BCR mediated survival in resting B cells,
likely through regulation of Foxo activation. PDK1-dependent signaling to NF-κB
is not crucial to resting B cell viability. However, PDK1 is necessary for
triggering NF-κB during B cell activation and is required for activated B cell
survival. Together these studies demonstrate that PDK1 is essential for
BCR-induced signal transduction to Foxo and NF-κB and is indispensable for both
resting and activated B cell survival.
