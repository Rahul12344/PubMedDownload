AIM: Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed behaviorally active substances
in the world. Although its effects on the central nervous system and bone
metabolism have been documented, as yet there is no report on its effect on
tissues in the oral cavity. In this study we analyzed the viability of human
gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity after
exposure to different concentrations of caffeine for different exposure time
periods.
METHODS: The HGF were cultured with different concentrations of caffeine.
Viability of cells exposed to caffeine was analyzed by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to assess
mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. The activity of ALP was analyzed at
specific time intervals after caffeine addition.
RESULTS: Our results showed that caffeine of concentrations <1 mm did not affect 
the viability of HGF and the ALP enzyme activity. Nevertheless, caffeine at 5 and
10 mm dramatically decreased the viability and ALP activity of the cells after
4 days such that, by day 9, the viability of cells declined to near zero in the
10 mm group.
CONCLUSION: These results provided evidence that caffeine in high concentrations 
can decrease cellular viability and ALP activity in HGF.
