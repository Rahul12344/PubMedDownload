BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal diseases play a major role in human morbidity and
mortality. We present the results of a Danish nationwide study of recurrent
paediatric invasive pneumococcal disease (rIPD) focusing on the epidemiological, 
microbiological, and clinical aspects.
METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed cases of IPD in children aged 0-15 y were
identified from the Neisseria and Streptococcus Reference Laboratory, Statens
Serum Institut, Denmark for the period 1980-2013. rIPD was defined as isolation
of Streptococcus pneumoniae from any normally sterile site â‰¥ 30 days after an
initial positive culture. Clinical data were obtained for all children with rIPD.
RESULTS: Of all children with IPD, 2.4% (59/2418) experienced at least 1 episode 
of rIPD, and an underlying condition was documented in 39 (66%). Immune
deficiency due to transplantation (n = 9) was the most common disease; however,
anatomic abnormalities (n = 8), complement C2 deficiency (n = 4), and congenital 
asplenia (n = 3) were all registered more than once. No underlying disease was
detected in 18 children (31%). Based on the serotype distribution of S.
pneumoniae isolates in rIPD among children aged 0-5 y (n = 41), 51%, 66%, and 78%
of the cases would have been covered by the 7-, 10-, and 13-valent pneumococcal
conjugate vaccines, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Of children with an IPD episode, 2.4% experienced rIPD, and an
underlying disease was documented in 66% of these children. Investigation of
underlying conditions is essential in episodes of rIPD.
