RNA helicases are the largest group of enzymes in eukaryotic RNA metabolism. The 
DEXD/H-box putative RNA helicases form the helicase superfamily II, whose members
are defined by seven highly conserved amino acid motifs, making specific
targeting of selected members a challenging pharmacological problem. The
translation initiation factor eIF4A is the prototypical DEAD-box RNA helicase
that works in conjunction with eIF4B and eIF4H and as a subunit of eIF4F to
prepare the mRNA template for ribosome binding, possibly by unwinding the
secondary structure proximal to the 5' m7GpppN cap structure. We report the
identification and characterization of a small molecule inhibitor of eukaryotic
translation initiation that acts in an unusual manner by stimulating
eIF4A-associated activities. Our results suggest that proper control of eIF4A
helicase activity is necessary for efficient ribosome binding and demonstrate the
feasibility of selectively targeting DEAD-box RNA helicases with small molecules.
