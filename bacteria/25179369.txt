BACKGROUND: Propionibacterium acnes has been linked to chronic infections in
shoulder surgery. Whether the bacterium is a contaminant or commensal of the deep
tissue is unclear. We aimed to assess P. acnes in intraoperative samples of
different tissue layers in patients undergoing first-time shoulder surgery.
METHODS: In 118 consecutive patients (mean age, 59.2 years; 75 men, 43 women),
intraoperative samples were correlated to preoperative subacromial injection, the
type of surgical approach, and gender. One skin, one superficial, one deep
tissue, and one test sample were cultured for each patient.
RESULTS: The cultures were positive for P. acnes in 36.4% (n = 43) of cases.
Subacromial injection was not associated with bacterial growth rates (P = .88 for
P. acnes; P = .20 for bacteria other than P. acnes; P = .85 for the anterolateral
approach; P = .92 for the deltopectoral approach; P = .56 for men; P = .51 for
women). Skin samples were positive for P. acnes in 8.5% (n = 10), superficial
samples were positive in 7.6% (n = 9), deep samples were positive in 13.6%
(n = 16), and both samples (superficial and deep) were positive in 15.3% (n = 18)
of cases (P < .0001). P. acnes was detected in the anterolateral approach in
27.1% (n = 32) of cases and in the deltopectoral approach in 9.3% (n = 11) of
cases (P = .01; relative risk, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.43).
Thirty-five of the P. acnes-positive patients were men (81.4%), and 8 patients
were women (18.6%; P = .001; relative risk, 2.51; 95% confidence interval,
1.28-4.90).
DISCUSSION: P. acnes was detected in more than one third of patients undergoing
first-time shoulder surgery. Preoperative subacromial injection was not
associated with bacterial growth. P. acnes was observed more frequently in the
deep tissues than in the superficial tissues. The relative risk for obtaining a
positive P. acnes culture was 2-fold greater for the anterolateral approach than 
for the deltopectoral approach, and the risk was 2.5-fold greater for men.
