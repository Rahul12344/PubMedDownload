BACKGROUND: As regulators of multifunctional metalloproteinases including MMP,
ADAM and ADAMTS families, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) play a 
pivotal role in extracellular matrix remodeling, which is involved in a wide
variety of physiological processes. Since abnormal metalloproteinase activities
are related to numerous diseases such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, and 
neurological disorders, TIMPs and their engineered mutants hold therapeutic
potential and thus have been extensively studied. Traditional productions of
functional TIMPs and their N-terminal inhibitory domains (N-TIMPs) rely on costly
and time-consuming insect and mammalian cell systems, or tedious and inefficient 
refolding from denatured inclusion bodies. The later process is also associated
with heterogeneous products and batch-to-batch variation.
RESULTS: In this study, we developed a simple approach to directly produce high
yields of active TIMPs in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli without
refolding. Facilitated by disulfide isomerase (DsbC) co-expression in
protease-deficient strain BL21 (DE3), N-TIMP-1/-2 and TIMP-2 which contain
multiple disulfide bonds were produced without unwanted truncations. 0.2-1.4Â mg
purified monomeric TIMPs were typically yielded per liter of culture media.
Periplasmically produced TIMPs exhibited expected inhibition potencies towards
MMP-1/2/7/14, and were functional in competitive ELISA to elucidate the binding
epitopes of MMP specific antibodies. In addition, prepared N-TIMPs were fully
active in a cellular context, i.e. regulating cancer cell morphology and
migration in 2D and 3D bioassays.
CONCLUSION: Periplasmic expression in E. coli is an excellent strategy to
recombinantly produce active TIMPs and N-TIMPs.
