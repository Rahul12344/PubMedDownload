The immune response to microbial pathogens is initiated by recognition of
specific pathogen components by host cells both at the cell surface and in the
cytosol. While the response triggered by pathogen products at the surface of
immune cells is well characterized, that initiated in the cytosol is poorly
understood. Nod1 is a member of a growing family of intracellular proteins with
structural homology to apoptosis regulators Apaf-1/Ced-4 and a class of plant
disease-resistant gene products. Here we show that bacterial lipopolysaccharides,
but not other pathogen components tested, induced TLR4- and MyD88-independent
NF-kappaB activation in human embryonic kidney 293T cells expressing trace
amounts of Nod1. Nod2, another Nod family member, also conferred responsiveness
to bacterial components but with a response pattern different from that observed 
with Nod1. As it was reported for plant disease-resistant R proteins, the
leucine-rich repeats of Nod1 and Nod2 were required for
lipopolysaccharide-induced NF-kappaB activation. A lipopolysaccharide binding
activity could be specifically coimmunopurified with Nod1 from cytosolic
extracts. These observations suggest that Nod1 and Nod2 are mammalian
counterparts of plant disease-resistant gene products that may function as
cytosolic receptors for pathogen components derived from invading bacteria.
