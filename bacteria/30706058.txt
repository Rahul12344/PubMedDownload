Aging has a profound impact on multiple facets of the immune system, culminating 
in aberrant functionality. The architectural disorganization of splenic white
pulp is a hallmark of the aging spleen, yet the factors underlying these
structural changes are unclear. Fibroblastic reticular cells comprise one stromal
cell subset in the spleen that is important for maintenance of architectural
organization, yet it remains to be determined how aging impacts these cells. In
this study, we sought to determine how aging impacts splenic T cell zone
reticular cell (TRC) numbers, morphology, and function. Using a mouse model of
aging, we found that aged naive spleens have fewer TRCs than young spleens. This 
reduction in TRC number correlated with reduced CCL19 and CCL21 concentrations in
aged spleens, which may contribute to impaired homing of T cells. CCL21 in both
young and aged spleens localized with TRCs. Aged TRCs extended marginally into B 
cell follicles and may contribute to the blending of the T cell zone and B cell
follicles in aged spleens. The described age-related changes in TRCs number and
function may be an underlying factor contributing to impaired immune system
function with age.
