Valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is an essential ATP-dependent protein
unfoldase. Dominant mutations in p97 cause multisystem proteinopathy (MSP), a
disease affecting the brain, muscle, and bone. Despite the identification of
numerous pathways that are perturbed in MSP, the molecular-level defects of these
p97 mutants are not completely understood. Here, we use biochemistry and
cryoelectron microscopy to explore the effects of MSP mutations on the unfoldase 
activity of p97 in complex with its substrate adaptor NPLOC4⋅UFD1L (UN). We show 
that all seven analyzed MSP mutants unfold substrates faster. Mutant homo- and
heterohexamers exhibit tighter UN binding and faster substrate processing. Our
structural studies suggest that the increased UN affinity originates from a
decoupling of p97's nucleotide state and the positioning of its N-terminal
domains. Together, our data support a gain-of-function model for p97-UN-dependent
processes in MSP and underscore the importance of N-terminal domain movements for
adaptor recruitment and substrate processing by p97.
