PURPOSE: The potential role of commensals as triggering factors that promote
inflammation in dry eye disease has not been explored. The objective of this
study was to evaluate whether ocular microbiota changes with the onset of dry eye
disease in thrombospondin-1-deficient (TSP-1(-/-)) mice, a strain that develops
Sjögren's syndrome-like disease.
METHODS: Conjunctival swabs were collected from TSP-1(-/-) and C57BL/6 mice and
analyzed for bacterial presence. Opsonophagocytosis of the bacterial conjunctival
isolates derived from the aged TSP-1(-/-) mice by neutrophils derived from either
TSP-1(-/-) or C57BL/6 bone marrow was evaluated. The bactericidal activities of
TSP-1-derived peptide were examined.
RESULTS: We found that in TSP-1(-/-) mice, the conjunctival colonization with
Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci sp (CNS) species was
significantly increased with aging and preceded that of the wild-type C57BL/6
control mice. This correlated with increased neutrophil infiltration into the
conjunctiva of the TSP-1(-/-) mice, suggesting that TSP-1 plays a significant
role in regulating immunity to commensals. Accordingly, the TSP-1(-/-) PMNs
opsonophagocytozed the ocular commensals less efficiently than the
TSP-1-sufficient neutrophils. Furthermore, a TSP-1-derived peptide, 4N1K,
exhibited significant antimicrobial activity when compared to a control peptide
against commensal sp.
CONCLUSION: These studies illustrate that alterations in the commensal frequency 
occur in the early stages of development of Sjögren's-like pathology and suggest 
that interventions that limit commensal outgrowth such as the use of
TSP-1-derived peptides could be used for treatment during the early stages of the
disease to reduce the commensal burden and ensuing inflammation.
