BACKGROUND: Octopus vulgaris has been an iconic cephalopod species for
neurobiology research as well as for cephalopod aquaculture. It is one of the
most intelligent and well-studied invertebrates, possessing both long- and
short-term memory and the striking ability to perform complex cognitive tasks.
Nevertheless, how the common octopus developed these uncommon features remains
enigmatic. O. vulgaris females spawn thousands of small eggs and remain with
their clutch during their entire development, cleaning, venting and protecting
the eggs. In fact, eggs incubated without females usually do not develop
normally, mainly due to biological contamination (fungi, bacteria, etc.). This
high level of parental care might have hampered laboratory research on the
embryonic development of this intriguing cephalopod.
RESULTS: Here, we present a completely parameter-controlled artificial seawater
standalone egg incubation system that replaces maternal care and allows
successful embryonic development of a small-egged octopus species until hatching 
in a laboratory environment. We also provide a practical and detailed staging
atlas based on bright-field and light sheet fluorescence microscopy imaging for
precise monitoring of embryonic development. The atlas has a comparative section 
to benchmark stages to the different scales published by Naef (1928), Arnold
(1965) and Boletzky (2016). Finally, we provide methods to monitor health and
wellbeing of embryos during organogenesis.
CONCLUSION: Besides introducing the study of O. vulgaris embryonic development to
a wider community, this work can be a high-quality reference for comparative
evolutionary developmental biology.
