T cell receptor signaling is essential for the generation and maturation of T
lymphocyte precursors. Here we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD as a
positive regulator of proximal T cell receptor signaling in thymocytes. CYLD
physically interacted with active Lck and promoted recruitment of active Lck to
its substrate, Zap70. CYLD also removed both Lys 48- and Lys 63-linked
polyubiquitin chains from Lck. Because of a cell-autonomous defect in T cell
development, CYLD-deficient mice had substantially fewer mature CD4(+) and CD8(+)
single-positive thymocytes and peripheral T cells.
