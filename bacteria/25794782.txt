AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: T cells play a major role in the pathogenesis of type 1
diabetes, and there is great interest in developing curative immunotherapies
targeting these cells. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting the T
cell receptor β-chain (TCRβ) was investigated for its ability to prevent and
reverse disease in mouse models of diabetes.
METHODS: RIP-OVA(hi) (C57BL/6-Tg(Ins2-OVA)59Wehi/WehiJ) mice adoptively
transferred with ovalbumin-specific T cells (an induced model of diabetes) and
NOD mice (a spontaneous model of diabetes) were used to test anti-TCRβ mAb
therapy as a means of preventing and reversing type 1 diabetes.
RESULTS: A single dose of anti-TCRβ completely prevented disease in RIP-OVA(hi)
mice without inducing the release of inflammatory cytokines. Transient anti-TCRβ 
therapy prevented diabetes in 90% of NOD mice and reversed the disease after its 
onset in 73% of NOD mice. Long after the remission of type 1 diabetes, the
anti-TCRβ treated mice were able to reject BALB/c skin allografts with normal
kinetics while maintaining normoglycaemia. Treatment did not cause significant
reductions in lymphocyte numbers in the spleen or pancreatic lymph nodes, but did
result in a decreased percentage of chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) positive, CD8(+) 
T cells. Notably, anti-TCRβ therapy increased the expression of programmed death 
1 (PD-1) on the surface of the T cells; PD-1 expression is important for
maintaining anti-TCRβ-induced self-tolerance, as type 1 diabetes recurs in mice
following a blockade of PD-1 signalling.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Anti-TCRβ mAb is a safe and effective immunotherapy
that results in reduced numbers of CCR9(+) T cells, an increased expression of
PD-1 on T cells and the restoration of self-tolerance in NOD mice.
