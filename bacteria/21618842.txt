BACKGROUND: Baseline prevalence and knowledge, attitude and perception (KAP)
survey is a prerequisite for mass drug administration for the control of
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and other neglected tropical diseases.
METHODS: In preparation for the first mass drug administration for LF
elimination, a baseline survey was conducted in six sentinel sites in the
southern Malawi, amongst participants aged five years or more. A standard
questionnaire was used to obtain data on socio-demographic factors, ownership and
use of bed nets, previous ingestion of ivermectin and KAP toward hydrocele and
lymphoedema. Finger prick blood samples were collected from 22:00 to 01:00 hours 
for LF microscopy, malaria and haemoglobin examination. Stool and urine samples
were collected for internal helminths and schistosomiasis respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 1, 903 participants were enrolled. Knowledge on the cause of 
hydrocele and lymphoedema was low in all the sentinel sites (16%-42%, 10%-24%
(respectively). Sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman, bad weather and
HIV/AIDS were perceived causes of hydrocele. Microfilaraemia prevalence was 1.5% 
and varied little between sentinel sites (1.0%-2.1%). Childhood urinary
schistosomiasis was common in Phalombe (94.9%) and Blantyre (26.9%).
CONCLUSION: Integrated approach and understanding of the community KAP is vital
or successful implementation of LF elimination programme.
