We have cloned a murine cDNA on the basis of homology to the tyrosine kinase
domain of the bek fibroblast growth factor receptor. This cDNA encodes a putative
tyrosine kinase receptor with a unique structural pattern in its extracellular
domain. It is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily with two
immunoglobulin-like domains. It also contains two fibronectin type III domains
which are found on diverse proteins such as receptor tyrosine phosphatases and
neural cell adhesion molecules. This protein tyrosine kinase called ark
(adhesion-related kinase) is likely to represent a new class of receptor tyrosine
kinase. Ark mRNA appears to be expressed in most cell lines and adult tissues
examined except those of hematopoietic lineage. It is undetectable in
undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cells, F9 and N Tera 2.
