Isolation of most ultraviolet B (UV-B)-resistant culturable bacteria that occur
in the habitat of Laguna Azul, a high-altitude wetland [4554 m above sea level
(asl)] from the Northwestern Argentinean Andes, was carried out by culture-based 
methods. Water from this environment was exposed to UV-B radiation under
laboratory conditions during 36 h, at an irradiance of 4.94 W/m2. It was found
that the total number of bacteria in water samples decreased; however, most of
the community survived long-term irradiation (312 nm) (53.3 kJ/m2). The
percentage of bacteria belonging to dominant species did not vary significantly, 
depending on the number of UV irradiation doses. The most resistant microbes in
the culturable community were Gram-positive pigmented species (Bacillus
megaterium [endospores and/or vegetative cells], Staphylococcus saprophyticus,
and Nocardia sp.). Only one Gram-negative bacterium could be cultivated
(Acinetobacter johnsonii). Nocardia sp. that survived doses of 3201 kJ/m2 were
the most resistant bacteria to UV-B treatment. This study is the first report on 
UV-B resistance of a microbial community isolated from high-altitude extreme
environments, and proposes a method for direct isolation of UV-B-resistant
bacteria from extreme irradiated environments.
