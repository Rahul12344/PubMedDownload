CD28 provides a co-stimulatory signal critical for optimal T cell activation. We 
and others have shown that the B7/CD28 co-stimulatory pathway is a major
regulatory pathway for the control of immune responses. Experimentally induced
models of autoimmunity have been shown to be prevented or reduced in intensity in
mice deficient for CD28. Here, we show that EAE and accompanying
neuroantigen-specific immune responses are drastically reduced in the absence of 
CD28. However, we go on to show that EAE can be induced in CD28-deficient mice
following two immunizations. After re-immunization, CD28-deficient mice develop
severe EAE with myelin-specific responses equal to those of wildtype controls,
and extensive demyelination in the spinal cord. Treatment of CD28-deficient mice 
with anti-CD40L at the time of immunization significantly reduced DTH responses
and prevented the development of EAE following two immunizations, indicating a
critical role for CD40/CD40L signaling in the absence of CD28. Taken together,
our results indicate that CD28-mediated co-stimulation does not regulate
immunological anergy. Instead, CD28 appears to adjust the threshold for
activation and expansion of autoreactive cells.
