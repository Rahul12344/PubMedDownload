Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a member of the 
nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand-activated transcriptional factors.
Among other functions, PPAR-gamma acts as a key regulator of the adipogenesis.
Since several cytokines (IL-1, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta) had been known to inhibit
adipocyte differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), we examined the
effect of these cytokines on the transactivation function of PPAR-gamma. We found
that the TNF-alpha/IL-1-activated TAK1/TAB1/NIK (NFkappaB-inducible kinase)
signaling cascade inhibited both the adipogenesis and Tro-induced transactivation
by PPAR-gamma by blocking the receptor binding to the cognate DNA response
elements. Furthermore, it has been shown that the noncanonical Wnts are expressed
in MSCs and that Wnt-5a was capable to inhibit transactivation by PPAR-gamma.
Treatment with Wnt5a-activated NLK (nemo-like kinase) induced physical
association of the endogenous NLK and H3K9 histone methyltransferase (SETDB1)
protein complexes with PPAR-gamma. This resulted in histoneH3K9 tri-methylation
at PPAR-gamma target gene promoters. Overall, our data show that cytokines and
noncanonical Wnts play a crucial role in modulation of PPAR-gamma regulatory
function in its target cells and tissues.
