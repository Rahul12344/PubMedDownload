OBJECTIVE: Human gingival epithelium is continuously exposed to bacteria and acts
as the first line of defense in periodontal tissues. It is crucial to maintain
healthy, non-inflamed gingival tissue to avoid gingivitis and periodontitis. The 
purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of IL-4 in human gingival 
fibroblasts (hGF) on the activation of osteoclasts.
DESIGN: Two hGF samples were obtained from two healthy patients, and one was
collected from a commercially available resource. The hGFs were cultured, and
conditioned medium of hGF (hGF-CM) was stocked at -80°C. The mRNA was isolated
from the hGF cultures and analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) for expression of suppressive osteoclastogenetic mediators,
such as interleukin (IL)-4, osteoprotegerin (OPG), IL-10, IL-27, and IL-33. The
hGF-CM was used to investigate the inhibitory function of mouse macrophages
supplemented with either glutathione S-transferase-Receptor activator of NF-kB
ligand (GST-RANKL), human recombinant (rh)IL-4, or rhOPG but not a combination.
Differentiation of osteoclasts was examined by tartrate resistant acid
phosphatase (TRAP) staining and TRAP assay. The suppressive role of IL-4 was
assessed by neutralizing IL-4 antibody in the TRAP assay.
RESULTS: The hGF-CM reduced both TRAP positive staining and activity in a
dose-dependent manner. IL-4 and OPG mRNA expressions were expressed in hGF-CM
from three different donors but that of IL-10, IL-27, or IL-33 was not detected. 
In the RAW264 culture, rhIL-4 and rhOPG reduced TRAP positive staining as well as
activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, addition of neutralizing
antibodies for IL-4 reduced the inhibitory effect of conditioned medium from
gingival fibroblasts in the RAW264 culture.
CONCLUSION: We concluded that hGF potentially contained suppressive mediators,
such as IL-4 and OPG, for osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, we confirmed that the
differential inhibition of osteoclast is caused by OPG as well as IL-4 in hGF-CM.
