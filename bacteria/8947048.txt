The protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is a critical component of the T cell
antigen receptor (TCR) signaling pathway, acting as a positive regulator of Src
family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) such as Lck. Most CD45-deficient human and
murine T cell lines are unable to signal through their TCRs. However, there is a 
CD45-deficient cell line that can signal through its TCR. We have studied this
cell line to identify a TCR signaling pathway that is independent of CD45
regulation. In the course of these experiments, we found that the Syk PTK, but
not the ZAP-70 PTK, is able to mediate TCR signaling independently of CD45 and of
Lck. For this function, Syk requires functional kinase and SH2 domains, as well
as intact phosphorylation sites in the regulatory loop of its kinase domain.
Thus, differential expression of Syk is likely to explain the paradoxical
phenotypes of different CD45-deficient T cells. Finally, these results suggest
differences in activation requirements between two closely related PTK family
members, Syk and ZAP-70. The differential activities of these two kinases suggest
that they may play distinct, rather than completely redundant, roles in
lymphocyte signaling.
