D-xylose isomerase (XI) is capable of sugar isomerization and slow conversion of 
some monosaccharides into their C2-epimers. We present X-ray and neutron
crystallographic studies to locate H and D atoms during the respective
isomerization and epimerization of L-arabinose to L-ribulose and L-ribose,
respectively. Neutron structures in complex with cyclic and linear L-arabinose
have demonstrated that the mechanism of ring-opening is the same as for the
reaction with D-xylose. Structural evidence and QM/MM calculations show that in
the reactive Michaelis complex L-arabinose is distorted to the high-energy (5)S1 
conformation; this may explain the apparent high KM for this sugar. MD-FEP
simulations indicate that amino acid substitutions in a hydrophobic pocket near
C5 of L-arabinose can enhance sugar binding. L-ribulose and L-ribose were found
in furanose forms when bound to XI. We propose that these complexes containing
Ni(2+) cofactors are Michaelis-like and the isomerization between these two
sugars proceeds via a cis-ene-diol mechanism.
