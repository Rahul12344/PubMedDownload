Peptidoglycan (PG), a major cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, has
been detected within antigen-presenting cells in various inflammatory conditions,
including psoriasis. The additional presence of T-helper 1 cells specific for
streptococcal or staphylococcal PG in psoriasis skin lesions implicates PG as an 
important T-cell stimulator for the disease. PG is a major target for the innate 
immune system, and associations between genetic polymorphisms of recognition
receptors for PG and various auto-inflammatory diseases have been identified. The
location of these genes within four linkage sites for psoriasis raises the
possibility that an altered innate recognition of PG might contribute to the
enhanced T-cell response to the bacterial antigen. These observations suggest
that PG is a major aetiological factor for psoriasis and emphasize the importance
of PG in bacterial-infection-induced inflammatory disease.
