Heat-killed pathogenic Leptospira interrogans serovar rachmati induced the
production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and the IFN-gamma-inducing cytokines
interleukin-12p40 (IL-12p40) and tumor necrosis factor alpha in human whole blood
in vitro. The production of IFN-gamma was largely dependent on IL-12. These data 
establish that pathogenic leptospires can stimulate the production of type I
cytokines involved in cellular immunity.
