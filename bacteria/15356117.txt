It is important to understand which molecules are relevant for linking innate and
adaptive immune cells. In this study, we show that OX40 ligand is selectively
induced on IL-2, IL-12, or IL-15-activated human NK cells following stimulation
through NKG2D, the low affinity receptor for IgG (CD16) or killer cell Ig-like
receptor 2DS2. CD16-activated NK cells costimulate TCR-induced proliferation, and
IFN-gamma produced by autologous CD4+ T cells and this process is dependent upon 
expression of OX40 ligand and B7 by the activated NK cells. These findings
suggest a novel and unexpected link between the natural and specific immune
responses, providing direct evidence for cross-talk between human CD4+ T cells
and NK receptor-activated NK cells.
