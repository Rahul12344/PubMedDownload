The Francisella tularensis strain LVS phagosome disintegrates during the first
few hours after bacterial entry and microbes are released to the cytosol. Within 
12 h both rapid multiplication of microbes and a steep increase of apoptosis of
infected macrophages occur. We searched for signals involved in the death of
macrophages and detected molecules associated with the autophagy machinery
cathepsin D, PTEN, p53 and LC3, whose levels or modification were influenced by
ongoing in vitro tularemic infection. The sequestration of cytoplasmic F.
tularensis LVS into autophagosomes was confirmed by co-localization of the LVS
strain containing vacuoles with LC3 (an autophagosomal marker). We also
demonstrated the presence of MHC II antigens in these autophagosomes, indicating 
that they might act as a source of endogenous tularemic antigens for presentation
to CD4+ T lymphocytes.
