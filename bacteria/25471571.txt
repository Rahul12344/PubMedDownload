Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6) is a soluble agonist of the TYRO3, AXL,
MERTK (TAM) family of receptor tyrosine kinases identified to have
anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and promyelinating properties. During
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), wild-type (WT) mice demonstrate 
a significant induction of Gas6, Axl, and Mertk but not Pros1 or Tyro3 mRNA. We
tested the hypothesis that intracerebroventricular delivery of GAS6 directly into
the CNS of WT mice during myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE
would improve the clinical course of disease relative to artificial CSF
(ACSF)-treated mice. GAS6 did not delay disease onset, but significantly reduced 
the clinical scores during peak and chronic EAE. Mice receiving GAS6 for 28 d had
preserved SMI31(+) neurofilament immunoreactivity, significantly fewer SMI32(+)
axonal swellings and spheroids and less demyelination relative to ACSF-treated
mice. Alternate-day subcutaneous IFNβ injection did not enhance GAS6 treatment
effectiveness. Gas6(-/-) mice sensitized with MOG35-55 peptide exhibit higher
clinical scores during late peak to early chronic disease, with significantly
increased SMI32(+) axonal swellings and Iba1(+) microglia/macrophages, enhanced
expression of several proinflammatory mRNA molecules, and decreased expression of
early oligodendrocyte maturation markers relative to WT mouse spinal cords with
scores for 8 consecutive days. During acute EAE, flow cytometry showed
significantly more macrophages but not T-cell infiltrates in Gas6(-/-) spinal
cords than WT spinal cords. Our data are consistent with GAS6 being protective
during EAE by dampening the inflammatory response, thereby preserving axonal
integrity and myelination.
