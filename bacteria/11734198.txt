In order to understand a role of the Ca(2+) ion on the structure and function of 
a Ca(2+)-dependent family I.3 lipase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38, apo-PML,
holo-PML, holo-PML*, and the N-terminal domain alone (N-fragment) were prepared
and biochemically characterized. Apo-PML and holo-PML represent refolded proteins
in the absence and presence of the Ca(2+) ion, respectively. Holo-PML* represents
a holo-PML dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The results suggest that the
C-terminal domain of PML is almost fully unfolded in the apo-form and its folding
is induced by Ca(2+) binding. The folding of this C-terminal domain may be
required to make a conformation of the N-terminal catalytic domain functional.
