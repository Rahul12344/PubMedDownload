AIM: Study the influence of staphylococcus vaccine on functional activity of
antigen-presenting cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice intraperitoneally received 500 μg of "Staphylovac"
vaccine. Phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages against Staphylococcus
aureus 1991 was determined in animals at various time intervals. Phagocytic index
(PI) and phagocytic number (PN) in smears made at 30 and 60 minutes of incubation
were calculated. Dendritic cells (DC) were obtained from bone marrow precursors
during cultivation with 20 ng/ml GM-CSF and 20 ng/ml IL-4 (BioSource
International Inc., Belgium). At day 6 of incubation staphylococcus vaccine (50
μg/ml) was added to immature cells for induction pf DC maturation. DC phenotype
evaluation was carried out by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies against 
cell antigens (Beckman Culter, USA).
RESULTS: PI at 30 and 60 minutes of incubation increased by 0.12 - 1.4 times and 
1.11 - 1.52 times, respectively, compared with control. PN at 30 minutes of
incubation of cells with microbial suspension increased from 8.6 to 11.4% against
5.9% in control, at 60 minutes of incubation--from 7.7 to 8.1% against 5.1% in
control. In DC culture during their incubation with the vaccine, content of cells
with expression of intercellular adhesion marker CD38, antigen presenting marker 
MHCII and DC terminal differentiation marker CD83 increased. Expression of CD34
and CD14 was also noted, that may give evidence on partial direction of cell
differentiation to macrophages.
CONCLUSION: "Staphylovac" vaccine during intraperitoneal administrationt to mice 
had activating influence on functional activity of antigen-presenting cells and
peritoneal macrophages.
