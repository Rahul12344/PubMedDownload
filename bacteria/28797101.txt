Bangladesh has a population with a low gastric cancer risk but high prevalence of
Helicobacter pylori infection. Several studies have examined virulence genes in
H. pylori from Bangladesh. We analyzed cagA and vacA subtypes and their
association with severe histology phenotypes, and analyzed population types among
Bangladeshi strains. We included patients who underwent endoscopy in Dhaka.
Sequences of virulence genes and seven housekeeping genes were obtained by next
generation sequencing and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We isolated 56 H.
pylori strains from 133 patients, of which 73.2% carried cagA, and all were
considered Western-type. Patients infected with cagA-positive strains had more
severe histological scores than patients infected with cagA-negative strains.
Among vacA s1 and m1 genotypes, the s1a (97.8%, 43/44) and m1c (28/30, 93.3%)
genotypes were predominant. All strains containing s1 and m1 (30/56, 53.6%) also 
had i1, d1, and c1. In contrast, all strains containing the less-virulent
genotypes s2 and m2 (12/56, 21.4%) also possessed i2, d2, and c2. Multivariate
analysis indicated that subjects infected with vacA m1-genotype strains only had 
a significantly higher risk of antrum atrophy than patients infected with
m2-genotype strains. Of the two main H. pylori populations in this study, hpAsia2
strains were associated with higher activity and inflammation in the antrum
compared to hpEurope strains; however, only vacA s1m1i1d1c1 strains, independent 
of population type, were significantly associated with inflammation in the
antrum, unlike the s2m2i2d2c2 genotype. In conclusion, Bangladeshi strains were
divided into two main populations of different genotypes. The low incidence of
gastric cancer in Bangladesh might be attributable to the high proportion of
less-virulent genotypes, which may be a better predictor of gastric cancer risk
than the ancestral origin of the H. pylori strains. Finally, the vacA m region
may be a better virulence marker than other regions.
