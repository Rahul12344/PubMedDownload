Macroautophagy/autophagy functions to degrade cellular components and
intracellular pathogens. Autophagy receptors, including SQSTM1/p62, target
intracellular pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus is a significant pathogen of
humans, especially in immunocompromise. S. aureus may use neutrophils as a
proliferative niche, but their intracellular fate following phagocytosis has not 
been analyzed in vivo. In vitro, SQSTM1 can colocalize with intracellular
Staphylococcus aureus, but whether SQSTM1 is beneficial or detrimental in host
defense against S. aureus in vivo is unknown. Here we determine the fate and
location of S. aureus within neutrophils throughout zebrafish infection. We show 
Lc3 and Sqstm1 recruitment to phagocytosed S. aureus is altered depending on the 
bacterial location within the neutrophil and that Lc3 marking of bacterial
phagosomes within neutrophils may precede bacterial degradation. Finally, we show
Sqstm1 is important for controlling cytosolic bacteria, demonstrating for the
first time a key role of Sqstm1 in autophagic control of S. aureus in
neutrophils.ABBREVIATIONS: AR: autophagy receptor; CFU: colony-forming unit; CHT:
