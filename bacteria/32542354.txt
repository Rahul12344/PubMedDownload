OBJECTIVES: To address the faecal carriage prevalence of
antibiotic-multiresistant bacteria and associated risk factors in a public
long-term care facility (LTCF).
METHODS: A prospective study in a single government-funded LTCF of 300 residents 
in Ciudad Real, Spain. Residents' clinical and demographic data were collected,
as well as recent antibiotic consumption in the institution. Each participant
contributed a rectal swab, which was plated on selective and
differential-selective media. Colonies were identified by MALDI-TOF and ESBL
production was confirmed by the double-disc synergy method, with characterization
of the molecular mechanism by PCR. Isolates were typed by PFGE and submitted for 
ST131 screening by PCR.
RESULTS: Faecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales was detected in 58
(31%) of 187 participants and previous infection by MDR bacteria was identified
as a risk factor. The genes characterized were: blaCTX-M-15 (40.6%); blaCTX-M-14 
(28.8%); blaCTX-M-27 (13.5%); and blaCTX-M-24 (10.1%). Some 56.4% of the isolates
were grouped into the E. coli ST131 clone; 70.9% of these corresponded to the
O25b serotype, 51.6% of them to Clade C1 (H30) and 12.9% to Clade C2 (H30Rx).
Clade C1 isolates were mostly C1-M27, whereas the C2 sublineage was mainly
related to the production of CTX-M-15. ST131-CTX-M-24 isolates (n = 6)
corresponded to Clade A with serotype O16.
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacterales faecal carriage
has been detected in a single LTCF, highlighting the emergence of ST131 Clade
A-M24 and Clade C1-M27 lineages.
