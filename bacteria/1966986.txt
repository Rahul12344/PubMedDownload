The metabolism of complement factor B and C3 was analyzed in three previously
described patients with congenital deficiency of factor I (C3b/C4b inactivator). 
Samples taken at steady state contained elevated levels of Ba and Bb, whereas
native factor B was not detectable. Following plasma infusion in two of the
patients Ba was rapidly cleared (within 8-12 hr) from the circulation and native 
factor B increased transiently, reaching normal levels within 22-24 hr. In
parallel with the increase in Ba, factor B decreased during the following days,
reaching preinfusion level after seven days. This was in contrast to a continued 
increase in C3 concentration, which was still within the normal range 15 days
after infusion, despite the presence of only trace amounts of native B. In vitro 
complement activation experiments, employing purified C3Nef IgG as alternative
pathway activator and aggregated IgG as classical pathway activator, were
performed on selected serum samples (base-line, 12 hr and 15 days postinfusion
samples) from the plasma infusion series. It was demonstrated that (a) C3Nef
could not induce alternative pathway C3-conversion in factor B depleted samples
and (b) C3-degradation by CP-activation could still occur in B-depleted samples, 
although at a much slower rate compared to normal human serum. These results may 
partly explain the difference in kinetics of factor B and C3 metabolism seen
after plasma infusion in patients with factor I deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT
