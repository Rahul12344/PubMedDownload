BACKGROUND: Enterococcal bacteremia has been associated with high case fatality, 
but it remains unknown to what extent death is caused by these infections. We
therefore quantified attributable mortality of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired
bacteremia caused by enterococci.
METHODS: From 2011 to 2013 we studied consecutive patients who stayed >48 hours
in 2 tertiary ICUs in the Netherlands, using competing risk survival regression
and marginal structural modeling to estimate ICU mortality caused by enterococcal
bacteremia.
RESULTS: Among 3080 admissions, 266 events of ICU-acquired bacteremia occurred in
218 (7.1%) patients, of which 76 were caused by enterococci (incidence rate, 3.0 
per 1000 patient-days at risk; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.3-3.7). A
catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was suspected in 44 (58%) of
these, prompting removal of 68% of indwelling catheters and initiation of
antibiotic treatment for a median duration of 3 (interquartile range 1-7) days.
Enterococcal bacteremia was independently associated with an increased case
fatality rate (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 2.68; 95% CI,
1.44-4.98). However, for patients with CRBSI, case fatality was similar for
infections caused by enterococci and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS;
adjusted SHR, 0.91; 95% CI, .50-1.67). Population-attributable fraction of
mortality was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.9%-6.9%) by day 90, reflecting a
population-attributable risk of 0.8% (95% CI, .4%-1.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired enterococcal bacteremia is associated with increased
case fatality; however, the mortality attributable to these infections is low
from a population perspective. The virulence of enterococci and CoNS in a setting
of CRBSI seems comparable.
