The function of NCR1 was studied in a model of experimental asthma, classified as
a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction, in mice. IgE levels were significantly
increased in the serum of OVA immunized NCR1 deficient (NCR1gfp/gfp) mice in
comparison to OVA immunized wild type (NCR1+/+) and adjuvant immunized mice.
Histological analysis of OVA immunized NCR1gfp/gfp mice revealed no preservation 
of the lung structure and overwhelming peribronchial and perivascular
granulocytes together with mononuclear cells infiltration. OVA immunized NCR+/+
mice demonstrated preserved lung structure and peribronchial and perivascular
immune cell infiltration to a lower extent than that in NCR1gfp/gfp mice.
Adjuvant immunized mice demonstrated lung structure preservation and no immune
cell infiltration. OVA immunization caused an increase in PAS production
independently of NCR1 presence. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) revealed NCR1
dependent decreased percentages of eosinophils and increased percentages of
lymphocytes and macrophages following OVA immunization. In the OVA immunized
NCR1gfp/gfp mice the protein levels of eosinophils' (CCL24) and Th2 CD4+ T-cells'
chemoattractants (CCL17, and CCL24) in the BAL are increased in comparison with
OVA immunized NCR+/+ mice. In the presence of NCR1, OVA immunization caused an
increase in NK cells numbers and decreased NCR1 ligand expression on CD11c+GR1+
cells and decreased NCR1 mRNA expression in the BAL. OVA immunization resulted in
significantly increased IL-13, IL-4 and CCL17 mRNA expression in NCR1+/+ and
NCR1gfp/gfp mice. IL-17 and TNFÎ± expression increased only in OVA-immunized
NCR1+/+mice. IL-6 mRNA increased only in OVA immunized NCR1gfp/gfp mice.
Collectively, it is demonstrated that NCR1 dampens allergic eosinophilic airway
inflammation.
