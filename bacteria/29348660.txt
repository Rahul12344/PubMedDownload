Donor-specific CD4+CD127-CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (AgTregs) have the
potential to induce clinical transplant tolerance; however, their expansion ex
vivo remains challenging. We optimized a novel expansion protocol to stimulate
donor-specific Tregs using soluble 4-trimer CD40 ligand (CD40L)-activated donor B
cells that expressed mature antigen-presenting cell markers. This avoided the use
of CD40L-expressing stimulator cells that might otherwise result in potential
cellular contamination. Purified allogeneic "recipient" CD4+CD25+ Tregs were
stimulated on days 0 and 7 with expanded "donor" B cells in the presence of IL-2,
TGFÎ² and sirolimus (SRL). Tregs were further amplified by polyclonal stimulation 
with anti-CD3/CD28 beads on day 14 without SRL, and harvested on day 21, with
extrapolated fold expansion into the thousands. The expanded AgTregs maintained
expression of classical Treg markers including demethylation of the Treg-specific
demethylated region (CNS2) and also displayed constricted TcR repertoire. We
observed AgTregs more potently inhibited MLR than polyclonally expanded Tregs and
generated new Tregs in autologous responder cells (a measure of infectious
tolerance). Thus, an optimized and more clinically applicable protocol for the
expansion of donor-specific Tregs has been developed.
