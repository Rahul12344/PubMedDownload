Flt3 ligand (FL) is an early-acting hematopoietic cytokine that stimulates the
proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells by activating
its cognate receptor, Flt3. Recently, FL was shown to potently contribute to the 
development and expansion of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and CD34(+)
natural killer cell progenitors in vivo. Here, we report a comprehensive method
for the production of bioactive recombinant human FL (rhFL) in E. coli, suitable 
for structural, biophysical and physiological studies. A soluble form of human FL
capable of binding to the Ftl3 receptor could be overexpressed in the E. coli
strain Rosetta-gami(DE3) as inclusion bodies. We have established protocols for
the efficient in vitro refolding and ensuing purification of rhFL to homogeneity 
(>95%), with yields approaching 5 mg of pure rhFL per liter of culture. The
ability of rhFL to adopt a bioactive conformation was confirmed via a
cell-proliferation assay and the activation of the Flt3 receptor in the human
leukemic cell line, OCI-AML3.
