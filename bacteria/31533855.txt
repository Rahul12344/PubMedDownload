BACKGROUND: UFM1 has been found to be involved in the regulation of tumor
development. This study aims to clarify the role and potential molecular
mechanisms of UFM1 in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer.
METHODS: Expression of UFM1 in gastric tumor and paired adjacent noncancerous
tissues from 437 patients was analyzed by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry,
and realtime PCR. Its correlation with the clinicopathological characteristics
and prognosis of gastric cancer patients was analyzed. The effects of UFM1 on the
invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells were determined by the wound and
trans-well assays, and the effect of UFM1 on subcutaneous tumor formation was
verified in nude mice. The potential downstream targets of UFM1 and related
molecular mechanisms were clarified by the human protein kinase assay and
co-immunoprecipitation technique.
RESULTS: Compared with the corresponding adjacent tissues, the transcription
level and protein expression level of UFM1 in gastric cancer tissues were
significantly downregulated (P < 0.05). The 5-year survival rate of gastric
cancer patients with low UFM1 expression was significantly lower than the
patients with high UFM1 expression (42.1% vs 63.0%, P < 0.05). The invasion and
migration abilities of gastric cancer cells with stable UFM1 overexpression were 
significantly decreased, and the gastric cancer cells with UFM1 stable knockdown 
showed the opposite results; similar results were also obtained in the nude mouse
model. Further studies have revealed that UFM1 could increase the ubiquitination 
level of PDK1 and decrease the expression of PDK1 at protein level, thereby
inhibiting the phosphorylation level of AKT at Ser473. Additionally, the effect
of UFM1 on gastric cancer cell function is dependent on the expression of PDK1.
The expression level of UFM1 can improve the poor prognosis of PDK1 in patients
with gastric cancer.
CONCLUSION: UFM1 suppresses the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by
increasing the ubiquitination of PDK1 through negatively regulating PI3K/AKT
signaling.
