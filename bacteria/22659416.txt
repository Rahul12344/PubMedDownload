T cell activation requires both antigen specific and co-stimulatory signals that 
include the interaction of CD28 with its ligands CD80 and CD86. These signals are
delivered by antigen presenting cells (APC) in the context of the immunological
synapse (IS). Reorganization of the cytoskeleton is required for the formation
and maintenance of the IS. Our results show that a highly conserved polylysine
motif in CD86 cytoplasmic tail, herein referred to as the K4 motif, is
responsible for the constitutive association of CD86 to the cytoskeleton in
primary human APC as well as in a murine APC model. This motif is not involved in
initial APC:T cell conjugate formation but mutation of the K4 motif affects CD86 
reorientation at the IS. Importantly, APCs expressing CD86 with mutated K4 motif 
are severely compromised in their capacity to trigger complete T cell activation 
upon peptide presentation as measured by IL-2 secretion. Altogether, our results 
reveal the critical importance of the cytoskeleton-dependent CD86 polarization to
the IS and more specifically the K4 motif for effective co-signaling.
