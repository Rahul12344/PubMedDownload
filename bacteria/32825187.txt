Uptake of bacteria by phagocytes is a crucial step in innate immune defence.
Members of the disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family critically control
the immune response by limited proteolysis of surface expressed mediator
molecules. Here, we investigated the significance of ADAM17 and its regulatory
adapter molecule iRhom2 for bacterial uptake by phagocytes. Inhibition of
metalloproteinase activity led to increased phagocytosis of pHrodo labelled
Gram-negative and -positive bacteria (E. coli and S. aureus, respectively) by
human and murine monocytic cell lines or primary phagocytes. Bone marrow-derived 
macrophages showed enhanced uptake of heat-inactivated and living E. coli when
they lacked either ADAM17 or iRhom2 but not upon ADAM10-deficiency. In monocytic 
THP-1 cells, corresponding short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown confirmed
that ADAM17, but not ADAM10, promoted phagocytosis of E. coli. The augmented
bacterial uptake occurred in a cell autonomous manner and was accompanied by
increased release of the chemokine CXCL8, less TNFα release and only minimal
changes in the surface expression of the receptors TNFR1, TLR6 and CD36.
Inhibition experiments indicated that the enhanced bacterial phagocytosis after
ADAM17 knockdown was partially dependent on TNFα-activity but not on CXCL8. This 
novel role of ADAM17 in bacterial uptake needs to be considered in the
development of ADAM17 inhibitors as therapeutics.
