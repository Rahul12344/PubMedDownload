Nanoparticulate delivery systems for vaccine adjuvants, designed to enhance
targeting of secondary lymphoid organs and activation of APCs, have shown
substantial promise for enhanced immunopotentiation. We investigated the adjuvant
activity of synthetic oligonucleotides containing CpG-rich motifs linked to the
sucrose polymer Ficoll, forming soluble 50-nm particles (DV230-Ficoll), each
containing >100 molecules of the TLR9 ligand, DV230. DV230-Ficoll was evaluated
as an adjuvant for a candidate vaccine for anthrax using recombinant protective
Ag (rPA) from Bacillus anthracis. A single immunization with rPA plus
DV230-Ficoll induced 10-fold higher titers of toxin-neutralizing Abs in
cynomolgus monkeys at 2 wk compared with animals immunized with equivalent
amounts of monomeric DV230. Monkeys immunized either once or twice with rPA plus 
DV230-Ficoll were completely protected from challenge with 200 LD50 aerosolized
anthrax spores. In mice, DV230-Ficoll was more potent than DV230 for the
induction of innate immune responses at the injection site and draining lymph
nodes. DV230-Ficoll was preferentially colocalized with rPA in key APC
populations and induced greater maturation marker expression (CD69 and CD86) on
these cells and stronger germinal center B and T cell responses, relative to
DV230. DV230-Ficoll was also preferentially retained at the injection site and
draining lymph nodes and produced fewer systemic inflammatory responses. These
findings support the development of DV230-Ficoll as an adjuvant platform,
particularly for vaccines such as for anthrax, for which rapid induction of
protective immunity and memory with a single injection is very important.
