CD8+ T cells require a signal through a costimulatory receptor in addition to TCR
engagement to become activated. The role of CD28 in costimulating T cell
activation is well established. NKG2D, a receptor found on NK cells, CD8+
alphabeta-TCR+ T cells, and gammadelta-TCR+ T cells, has also been implicated in 
T cell costimulation. In this study we have evaluated the role of NKG2D in
costimulating mouse and human naive and effector CD8+ T cells. Unexpectedly, in
contrast to CD28, NKG2D engagement by ligand or mAb is not sufficient to
costimulate naive or effector CD8+ T cell responses in conventional T cell
populations. While NKG2D did not costimulate CD8+ T cells on its own, it was able
to modify CD28-mediated costimulation of human CD8+ T cells under certain
contitions. It is, therefore, likely that NKG2D acts as a costimulatory molecule 
only under restricted conditions or requires additional cofactors.
