IL-8, a member of the chemokine family, has been shown to play an important role 
in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. The objective of this study was to
determine the mechanism of IL-8-mediated angiogenesis. We examined the direct
role of IL-8 in angiogenesis by examining IL-8 receptor expression on endothelial
cells and their proliferation, survival, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
production. We demonstrate that HUVEC and human dermal microvascular endothelial 
cells constitutively express CXCR1 and CXCR2 mRNA and protein. Recombinant human 
IL-8 induced endothelial cell proliferation and capillary tube organization while
neutralization of IL-8 by anti-IL-8 Ab blocks IL-8-mediated capillary tube
organization. Incubation of endothelial cells with IL-8 inhibited endothelial
cell apoptosis and enhanced antiapoptotic gene expression. Endothelial cells
incubated with IL-8 had higher levels of Bcl-x(L):Bcl-x(S) and Bcl-2:Bax ratios. 
Furthermore, incubation of endothelial cells with IL-8 up-regulated MMP-2 and
MMP-9 production and mRNA expression. Our data suggest that IL-8 directly
enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, survival, and MMP expression in CXCR1-
and CXCR2-expressing endothelial cells and regulated angiogenesis.
