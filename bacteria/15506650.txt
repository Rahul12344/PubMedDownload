OBJECTIVE: To establish a cell line for stable expression of human beta-defensin 
3 (hBD3).
METHODS: Full length cDNA of hBD3 was isolated from previously constructed
pGEM-hBD3 and then inserted into pcDNA3. The recombinant vector identified
carrying hBD3 with right direction was introduced into COS-7 cells by
Lipofectamine. Cell clones survived in G418-rich medium and with stable
expression of hBD3 in both mRNA and protein levels were identified by RT-PCR and 
Western blot respectively. Genomic integration of the hBD3 gene with the COS-7
cells was confirmed by Southern dot blot and primary analysis. The antimicrobial 
activity of the secreted hBD3 was also evaluated.
RESULTS: COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3-hBD3 expressed hBD3 stably in mRNA
and protein level. Southern dot blot analysis showed successful integration of
the hBD3 gene into the genome of COS-7 cell and the hBD-3 protein secreted into
the culture medium showed antimicrobial activity.
CONCLUSION: We successfully established a hBD3-expressing cell line.
