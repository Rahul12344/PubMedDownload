γδ T cells are a heterogeneous cell population with different subsets playing
specialized and often opposing roles during immune responses. A key question is
whether γδ thymocytes are determined for their effector function already at an
early stage, before their commitment to the γδ T-cell lineage, or are instructed 
during their later development. Here, we show that the adult Vγ1.1+ and Vγ2+ γδ
T-cell subsets both go through a CD73+ CD24+ development stage, and that the gene
regulation involved in lineage commitment is shared by both subsets. We
demonstrate that the major subset diversification first occurs after the cells
have committed to the γδ T-cell lineage, strongly supporting an instructive model
for functional programming of γδ T cells. In conclusion, we show that the two
major adult γδ T-cell subsets in mice develop through a shared pathway utilizing 
similar cellular machinery and that they diverge after the CD24+ CD73+ maturity
stage.
