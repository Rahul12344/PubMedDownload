BACKGROUND: Sepsis is frequently complicated by the release of cardiac troponin, 
but the clinical significance of this myocardial injury remains unclear. We
studied the associations between troponin release during sepsis and 1-year
outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled consecutive patients with sepsis in 2 Dutch
intensive care units between 2011 and 2013. Subjects with a clinically apparent
cause of troponin release were excluded. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I
(hs-cTnI) concentration in plasma was measured daily during the first 4 intensive
care unit days, and multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to model its
association with 1-year mortality while adjusting for confounding. In addition,
we studied cardiovascular morbidity occurring during the first year after
hospital discharge. Among 1258 patients presenting with sepsis, 1124 (89%) were
eligible for study inclusion. Hs-cTnI concentrations were elevated in 673 (60%)
subjects on day 1, and 755 (67%) ever had elevated levels in the first 4 days.
Cox regression analysis revealed that high hs-cTnI concentrations were associated
with increased death rates during the first 14 days (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.72;
95% confidence interval, 1.14-2.59 and hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence
interval, 1.10-2.62 for hs-cTnI concentrations of 100-500 and >500 ng/L,
respectively) but not thereafter. Furthermore, elevated hs-cTnI levels were
associated with the development of cardiovascular disease among 200 hospital
survivors who were analyzed for this end point (adjusted subdistribution hazard
ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.50).
CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial injury occurs in the majority of patients with sepsis and
is independently associated with early-but not late-mortality, as well as
postdischarge cardiovascular morbidity.
