Natural product chemistry, microbiology, and food, human, and plant metabolomics 
represent a few sources of complex metabolomics data generated by mass
spectrometry. Among the medley of software tools used to handle these data sets, 
no universal tool can qualitatively, quantitatively, or statistically address
major biological questions or tasks. CycloBranch 2, an open and platform-free
software, at least now provides the de novo generation of molecular formulas of
unknown compounds in both liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and mass
spectrometry imaging datafiles. For imaging files, this database-free approach
was documented in the bimodal image fusion and characterization of three small
molecules, including metallophores. The fine isotope ratio data filtering step
distinguished 34S/13C2 and 41K/13C2 features. The standalone software package is 
implemented in C++ and can be downloaded from
https://ms.biomed.cas.cz/cyclobranch/ and used under GNU General Public License.
