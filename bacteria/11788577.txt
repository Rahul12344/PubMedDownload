The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori uses a type IV secretion system to
inject the bacterial CagA protein into gastric epithelial cells. Within the host 
cell, CagA becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and initiates cytoskeletal
rearrangements. We demonstrate here that Src-like protein-tyrosine kinases
mediate CagA phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo. First, the Src-specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 specifically blocks CagA phosphorylation and
cytoskeletal rearrangements thereby inhibiting the CagA-induced hummingbird
phenotype of gastric epithelial cells. Second, CagA is in vivo phosphorylated by 
transiently expressed c-Src. Third, recombinant c-Src and lysates derived from
c-Src-expressing fibroblasts but not lysates derived from Src-, Yes-, and
Fyn-deficient cells phosphorylated CagA in vitro. Fourth, a transfected CagA-GFP 
fusion protein is phosphorylated in vivo in Src-positive fibroblasts but not in
Src-, Yes-, and Fyn-deficient cells. Because a CagA-GFP fusion protein mutated in
an EPIYA motif is not efficiently phosphorylated in any of these fibroblast
cells, the CagA EPIYA motif appears to constitute the major c-Src phosphorylation
site conserved among CagA-positive Helicobacter strains.
