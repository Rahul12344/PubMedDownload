Many dental implants fail due to the infection and inflammation that walk hand in
hand with poor healing and soft tissue integration. Titanium surfaces were
nanocoated with quercitrin, a natural flavonoid, with the aim to improve soft
tissue integration and increase dental implants success. Streptococcus mutans
attachment and biofilm formation was analysed. Then, the anti-inflammatory
properties and the potential of quercitrin-nanocoated surfaces to boost soft
tissue regeneration were tested using human gingival fibroblasts. An inflammatory
situation was mimicked using interleulin-1-beta. We found that
quercitrin-nanocoated surfaces decreased initial bacterial adhesion while
increasing human gingival fibroblasts attachment. Furthermore,
quercitrin-nanocoated Ti increased collagen mRNA levels and decreased matrix
metalloproteinase-1/tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinanse-1 mRNA ratio, which is
related to a reduced metalloproteinase-mediated collagen degradation, while also 
decreasing the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 release under basal and
inflammatory conditions. These results suggest that quercitrin-nanocoated
surfaces could enhance the soft tissue integration and increase dental implants
success.
