Viomycin, an antibiotic that has been used to fight tuberculosis infections, is
believed to block the translocation step of protein synthesis by inhibiting
ribosomal subunit dissociation and trapping the ribosome in an intermediate state
of intersubunit rotation. The mechanism by which viomycin stabilizes this state
remains unexplained. To address this, we have determined cryo-EM and X-ray
crystal structures of Escherichia coli 70S ribosome complexes trapped in a
rotated state by viomycin. The 3.8-Å resolution cryo-EM structure reveals a
ribosome trapped in the hybrid state with 8.6° intersubunit rotation and 5.3°
rotation of the 30S subunit head domain, bearing a single P/E state transfer RNA 
(tRNA). We identify five different binding sites for viomycin, four of which have
not been previously described. To resolve the details of their binding
interactions, we solved the 3.1-Å crystal structure of a viomycin-bound ribosome 
complex, revealing that all five viomycins bind to ribosomal RNA. One of these
(Vio1) corresponds to the single viomycin that was previously identified in a
complex with a nonrotated classical-state ribosome. Three of the newly observed
binding sites (Vio3, Vio4, and Vio5) are clustered at intersubunit bridges,
consistent with the ability of viomycin to inhibit subunit dissociation. We
propose that one or more of these same three viomycins induce intersubunit
rotation by selectively binding the rotated state of the ribosome at dynamic
elements of 16S and 23S rRNA, thus, blocking conformational changes associated
with molecular movements that are required for translocation.
