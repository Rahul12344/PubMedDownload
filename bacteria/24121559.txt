Th17 cells are a distinct subset of T cells that have been found to produce
interleukin 17 (IL-17), and differ in function from the other T cell subsets
including Th1, Th2, and regulatory T cells. Th17 cells have emerged as a central 
culprit in overzealous inflammatory immune responses associated with many
autoimmune disorders. In this method we purify T lymphocytes from the spleen and 
lymph nodes of C57BL/6 mice, and stimulate purified CD4+ T cells under control
and Th17-inducing environments. The Th17-inducing environment includes
stimulation in the presence of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies, IL-6, and
TGF-β. After incubation for at least 72 hours and for up to five days at 37 °C,
cells are subsequently analyzed for the capability to produce IL-17 through flow 
cytometry, qPCR, and ELISAs. Th17 differentiated CD4+CD25- T cells can be
utilized to further elucidate the role that Th17 cells play in the onset and
progression of autoimmunity and host defense. Moreover, Th17 differentiation of
CD4+CD25- lymphocytes from distinct murine knockout/disease models can contribute
to our understanding of cell fate plasticity.
