RhoH, an atypical small Rho-family GTPase, critically regulates thymocyte
differentiation through the coordinated interaction with Lck and Zap70.
Therefore, RhoH deficiency causes defective T cell development, leading to a
paucity of mature T cells. Since there has been no gain-of-function study on RhoH
before, we decided to take a transgenic approach to assess how the overexpression
of RhoH affects the development of T cells. Although RhoH transgenic (RhoHtg)
mice expressed three times more RhoH protein than wild-type mice, β-selection,
positive, and negative selection in the thymus from RhoHtg mice were unaltered.
However, transgenic introduction of RhoH into Rag2 deficient mice resulted in the
generation of CD4+ CD8+ (DP) thymocytes, indicating that overexpression of RhoH
could bypass β-selection without TCRβ gene rearrangement. This was confirmed by
the in vitro development of DP cells from Rag2-/-RhoHtg DN3 cells on TSt-4/Dll-1 
stroma in an Lck dependent manner. Collectively, our results indicate that an
excess amount of RhoH is able to initiate pre-TCR signaling in the absence of
pre-TCR complexes.
