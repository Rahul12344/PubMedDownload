DNA damage tolerance (DDT) is responsible for genomic stability and cell
viability by bypassing the replication block. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae DDT
employs two parallel branch pathways to bypass the DNA lesion, namely translesion
DNA synthesis (TLS) and error-free lesion bypass, which are mediated by
sequential modifications of PCNA. Rad5 has been placed in the error-free branch
of DDT because it contains an E3 ligase domain required for PCNA
polyubiquitination. Rad5 is a multi-functional protein and may also play a role
in TLS, since it interacts with the TLS polymerase Rev1. In this study we mapped 
the Rev1-interaction domain in Rad5 to the amino acid resolution and demonstrated
that Rad5 is indeed involved in TLS possibly through recruitment of Rev1. Genetic
analyses show that the dual functions of Rad5 can be separated and reconstituted.
Crystal structure analysis of the Rad5-Rev1 interaction reveals a consensus RFF
motif in the Rad5 N-terminus that binds to a hydrophobic pocket within the
C-terminal domain of Rev1 that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. This study
indicates that Rad5 plays a critical role in pathway choice between TLS and
error-free DDT.
