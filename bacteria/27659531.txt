The tumor-associated antigen RHAMM (HMMR/CD168) is expressed by monocyte-derived 
dendritic cells and presented to T cells.

We formerly demonstrated that vaccination with Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1)-loaded
autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) can be a well-tolerated
effective treatment in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Here, we
investigated whether we could introduce the receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated
motility (RHAMM/HMMR/CD168), another clinically relevant tumor-associated
antigen, into these mo-DCs through mRNA electroporation and elicit RHAMM-specific
immune responses. While RHAMM mRNA electroporation significantly increased RHAMM 
protein expression by mo-DCs, our data indicate that classical mo-DCs already
express and present RHAMM at sufficient levels to activate RHAMM-specific T
cells, regardless of electroporation. Moreover, we found that RHAMM-specific T
cells are present at vaccination sites in AML patients. Our findings implicate
that we and others who are using classical mo-DCs for cancer immunotherapy are
already vaccinating against RHAMM.
