Fusion genes including NPM-ALK can promote T cell transformation, but the signals
required to drive a healthy T cell to become malignant remain undefined. In this 
study, we introduce NPM-ALK into primary human T cells and demonstrate induction 
of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, attenuation of most T 
cell effector programs, re-emergence of an immature epigenomic profile, and
dynamic regulation of c-Myc, E2F, and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways early during
transformation. A mutant of NPM-ALK failed to bind several signaling complexes
including GRB2/SOS, SHC1, SHC4, and UBASH3B and was unable to transform T cells. 
Lastly, TCR-generated signals were required to achieve T cell transformation,
explaining how healthy individuals can harbor T cells with NPM-ALK
translocations. These findings describe the fundamental mechanisms of
NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenesis, and may serve as a model to better understand
factors that regulate tumor formation.
