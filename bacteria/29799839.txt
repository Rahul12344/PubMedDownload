BACKGROUND: In April 2010, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13)
replaced PCV7 in the infant immunisation schedule in England and Wales. Despite
limited serotype replacement in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) during the
first four post-PCV13 years, non-vaccine type (NVT) IPD increased substantially
in 2014/15. We undertook a carriage study in 2015/16 to help understand the
reasons for this increase.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Families with a child aged <5 years attending a
participating general practice in Gloucestershire or Hertfordshire were invited
to provide nasopharyngeal swabs from all consenting members. Swabs from 650
individuals (293 under five, 73 five to twenty and 284 >twenty years) were
cultured and serotyped for Streptococcus pneumoniae. Results were compared with
those from three previous household studies conducted in the same populations
between 2001 to 2013, and with the serotypes causing IPD to estimate case-carrier
ratios (CCRs). Overall carriage prevalence did not differ between the four
carriage studies with reductions in vaccine-type carriage offset by increases in 
NVT carriage. While no individual NVT serotype showed an increase in CCR from
2012/13, the composition of the serotypes comprising the NVT group differed such 
that the overall CCR of the NVT group had significantly increased since 2012/13. 
Carriage of two PCV13 serotypes, 3 and 19A, was found in 2015/16 (3/650 = 0.5%
and 2/650 = 0.3% respectively) with no overall reduction in carriage prevalence
of PCV13-7 serotypes since 2012/13, though 6C prevalence, a vaccine-related
serotype, had reduced from 1.8% in 2012/13 to 2/648 (0.3%) in 2015/16, p = 0.013.
CONCLUSIONS: There was continuing evolution in carried NVTs six years after PCV13
introduction which, in addition to being vaccine-driven, could also reflect
natural secular changes in certain NVTs. This poses challenges in predicting
future trends in IPD. Elimination of carriage and disease due to serotypes 3 and 
19A may not be achieved by PCV13.
