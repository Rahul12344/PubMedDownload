Platelet-derived chemokine CXCL7 (also known as NAP-2) plays a crucial role in
orchestrating neutrophil recruitment in response to vascular injury. CXCL7 exerts
its function by activating the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) receptor and
binding sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that regulate receptor activity. CXCL7
exists as monomers, dimers, and tetramers, and previous studies have shown that
the monomer dominates at lower and the tetramer at higher concentrations. These
observations then raise the question: what, if any, is the role of the dimer? In 
this study, we make a compelling observation that the dimer is actually the
favored form in the GAG-bound state. Further, we successfully characterized the
structural basis of dimer binding to GAG heparin using solution nuclear magnetic 
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The chemical shift assignments were obtained by
exploiting heparin binding-induced NMR spectral changes in the WT monomer and
dimer and also using a disulfide-linked obligate dimer. We observe that the
receptor interactions of the dimer are similar to the monomer and that
heparin-bound dimer is occluded from receptor interactions. Cellular assays also 
show that the heparin-bound CXCL7 is impaired for CXCR2 activity. We conclude
that the dimer-GAG interactions play an important role in neutrophil-platelet
crosstalk, and that these interactions regulate gradient formation and the
availability of the free monomer for CXCR2 activation and intrathrombus
neutrophil migration to the injury site.
