BACKGROUND: The Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway regulates cardiomyogenesis in
vivo and in differentiating P19 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells, a mouse embryonic
stem (mES) cell model. To further assess the transcriptional role of HH
signalling during cardiomyogenesis in stem cells, we studied the effects of
overexpressing GLI2, a primary transducer of the HH signalling pathway, in mES
cells.
RESULTS: Stable GLI2 overexpression resulted in an enhancement of cardiac
progenitor-enriched genes, Mef2c, Nkx2-5, and Tbx5 during mES cell
differentiation. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of the HH pathway in mES
cells resulted in lower expression of these genes. Mass spectrometric analysis
identified the chromatin remodelling factor BRG1 as a protein which
co-immunoprecipitates with GLI2 in differentiating mES cells. We then determined 
that BRG1 is recruited to a GLI2-specific Mef2c gene element in a HH
signalling-dependent manner during cardiomyogenesis in P19 EC cells, a mES cell
model.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we propose a mechanism where HH/GLI2 regulates the expression 
of Mef2c by recruiting BRG1 to the Mef2c gene, most probably via chromatin
remodelling, to ultimately regulate in vitro cardiomyogenesis.
