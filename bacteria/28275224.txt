BACKGROUND: In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), ventilator-associated 
pneumonia (VAP) is considered a dangerous complication, prompting early
aggressive antibiotic treatment and prophylaxis. While this approach increases
the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR), its clinical benefit has not
been demonstrated.
METHODS: One-year incidence of VAP in severe TBI patients (ICU stay >48 hours,
with either Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8 or receiving intracranial pressure monitoring, 
or having undergone emergency surgery) and the prevalence of MDR among those who 
eventually developed it, were compared in two Italian intensive care units (ICUs)
adopting different antibiotic approaches. Antibiotic use was guideline-driven and
aggressive in the Pisa-based unit (165 eligible patients), and very conservative 
and coupled with non-pharmacological prevention measures in Cesena (262
patients). Data were also compared with those of 208 Italian ICUs participating
in the same infection surveillance program.
RESULTS: Patient case mix and general care were similar in the two units. Overall
antibiotic pressure was higher in Pisa (58.9% vs. 26.1% of beds occupied by
patients receiving antibiotics, P<0.0001), as was antibiotic prophylaxis in
eligible patients (87.3% vs. 7.6%, P<0.0001; Italian ICUs, 69.2%) and empirical
therapy in those who developed VAP (60.8% vs. 25.2%, P<0.0001; Italian ICUs,
51.6%). The incidence rate of VAP did not significantly differ (39.8 per 1000
days of mechanical ventilation in Pisa, 49.3 in Cesena, P=0.16), although it
occurred earlier in Cesena (23.0% early VAP in Pisa vs. 61.2% in Cesena,
P<0.0001). Mortality was higher in Pisa but Cesena transferred more patients to
other hospitals, precluding comparison of the two rates. The prevalence of MDR
was higher in Pisa (38.2% vs. 9.9%, P<0.0001; Italian ICUs, 30.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Although not conclusive, these results call into question the
prevalent aggressive use of antibiotics in TBI patients and urge the scientific
community to produce better evidence for clinical recommendations.
