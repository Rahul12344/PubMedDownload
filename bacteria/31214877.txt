PML/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα), as a hallmark of acute promyeloid
leukemia (APL), is directly related to the outcome of clinical APL remedy. It is 
reported that arsenicals can effectively degrade PML/RARα, such as arsenic
trioxide and realgar. However, the high toxicity or insolubility have hampered
their clinical applications. Realgar transforming solution (RTS) was produced
from realgar by bioleaching process in our lab. Previous studies demonstrated
that RTS had a significant anti-cancer ability on chronic myeloid leukemia
through oncoprotein degradation. The capacity of RTS on treating APL is what is
focused on in this study. The results showed that RTS had a noticeable
sensitivity in NB4 cell, and RTS remarkably down-regulated PML/RARα expression
and induced cell differentiation. Further, RTS could accumulate PML/RARα into the
nuclear bodies and then execute degradation, which could be reversed by
proteasome inhibitor MG132. The results also exhibited that the reduction of
RTS-induced PML/RARα expression accompanied by the elevation of ubiquitin and
SUMO-1 protein expression. Finally, PML and SUMO-1 had been demonstrated to be
co-localized after RTS treatment by immunofluorescence co-localization assay and 
immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, these results suggested that
RTS-induced cell differentiation may attribute to the PML/RARα degradation
partially through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
