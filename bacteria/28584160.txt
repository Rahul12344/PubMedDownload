Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a pandemic clonal lineage that is
responsible for the global increase in fluoroquinolone resistance and
extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) producers. The members of ST131 clade C,
especially subclades C2 and C1-M27, are associated with ESBLs. We developed a
multiplex conventional PCR assay with the ability to detect all ST131 clades (A, 
B, and C), as well as C subclades (C1-M27, C1-nM27 [C1-non-M27], and C2). To
validate the assay, we used 80 ST131 global isolates that had been fully
sequenced. We then used the assay to define the prevalence of each clade in two
Japanese collections consisting of 460 ESBL-producing E. coli ST131 (2001-12) and
329 E. coli isolates from extraintestinal sites (ExPEC) (2014). The assay
correctly identified the different clades in all 80 global isolates: clades A (n 
= 12), B (n = 12), and C, including subclades C1-M27 (n = 16), C1-nM27 (n = 20), 
C2 (n = 17), and other C (n = 3). The assay also detected all 565 ST131 isolates 
in both collections without any false positives. Isolates from clades A (n = 54),
B (n = 23), and C (n = 483) corresponded to the O serotypes and the fimH types of
O16-H41, O25b-H22, and O25b-H30, respectively. Of the 483 clade C isolates,
C1-M27 was the most common subclade (36%), followed by C1-nM27 (32%) and C2
(15%). The C1-M27 subclade with blaCTX-M-27 became especially prominent after
2009. Our novel multiplex PCR assay revealed the predominance of the C1-M27
subclade in recent Japanese ESBL-producing E. coli isolates and is a promising
tool for epidemiological studies of ST131.
