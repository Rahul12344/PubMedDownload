Staphylococcal exotoxins (SE) are superantigens that bind to monomorphic
determinants on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and
stimulate human peripheral blood T lymphocytes in a V beta-specific manner. SE
also deliver activation signals via MHC class II molecules that initiate cell
adhesion and cytokine gene transcription. These events are preceded by tyrosine
phosphorylation and are antagonized by inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, indicating
an essential role for these kinases in signaling via class II molecules. We
report that stimulation of human peripheral blood monocytes with SE induced rapid
and selective activation of the src-related protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) fgr
and hck. SE also induced the activation of fgr and lyn in B cells. PTK activation
by SE required MHC class II expression, and was greatly potentiated in the
presence of T cells bearing toxin-specific V beta chains. These results indicate 
that in addition to their antigen and superantigen-presenting function, MHC class
II molecules act as signal-transducing receptors that are coupled to src-type
PTK.
