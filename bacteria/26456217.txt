While FbpA, a family of bacterial fibronectin (FN) binding proteins has been
studied in several gram-positive bacteria, the gram-negative Treponema denticola,
an anaerobic periodontal pathogen, also has an overlooked fbp gene (tde1579). In 
this research, we confirm that recombinant Fbp protein (rFbp) of T. denticola
binds human FN with a Kdapp of 1.5 × 10(-7) M and blocks the binding of T.
denticola to FN in a concentration-dependent manner to a level of 42%. The fbp
gene was expressed in T. denticola. To reveal the roles of fbp in T. denticola
pathogenesis, an fbp isogenic mutant was constructed. The fbp mutant had 51%
reduced binding ability to human gingival fibroblasts (hGF). When hGF were
challenged with T. denticola, the fbp mutant caused less cell morphology change, 
had 50% reduced cytotoxicity to hGF, and had less influence on the growth of hGF 
cells.
