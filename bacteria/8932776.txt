The gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, has been used 
extensively in experimental studies of host immunity. The pronounced type 2
primary immune response to H. polygyrus is associated with elevated CD4+,
TCR-alpha/beta + T cell IL-4 production and elevated serum IgE levels that are
blocked by inhibiting CD28/ CTLA4-B7 interactions following in vivo
administration of the chimeric fusion protein, CTLA4Ig. In the present study, we 
have examined the in vivo effects of blocking CTLA4Ig ligands on the secondary
type 2 mucosal host protective immune response to this parasite. Our results show
that although CD4+, TCR-alpha/beta + cells remain the primary source of elevated 
IL-4 during the secondary response, the protective immune response and the
effector cell activity associated with it is B7-independent as CTLA4Ig
administration at the time of challenge does not block (1) elevations in T cell
IL-4 gene expression or protein secretion; (2) elevations in serum IgE levels,
mucosal mastocytosis, or eosinophilia; or (3) host protection, as measured by
adult worm burden and fecundity. These findings suggest that memory T helper
cells do not require CD28-B7 interactions for their activation to effector cells 
that can mediate a host protective type 2 immune response.
