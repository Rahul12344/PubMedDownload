To overcome bacterial resistances, the need for novel antimicrobial agents is
urgent. The class of so-called nucleoside antibiotics furnishes promising
candidates for the development of new antibiotics, as these compounds block a
clinically unexploited bacterial target: the integral membrane protein MraY, a
key enzyme in cell wall (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis. Nucleoside antibiotics
exhibit remarkable structural diversity besides their uridine-derived core
motifs. Some sub-classes also show specific selectivities towards different
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which are poorly understood so far.
Herein, the synthesis of a novel hybrid structure is reported, derived from the
5'-defunctionalized uridine core moiety of muraymycins and the peptide chain of
sansanmycin B, as a new scaffold for the development of antimicrobial agents. The
reported muraymycin-sansanmycin hybrid scaffold showed nanomolar activity against
the bacterial target enzyme MraY, but displayed no significant antibacterial
activity against S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa.
