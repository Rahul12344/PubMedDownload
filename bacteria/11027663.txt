The receptor tyrosine kinase Flt3 has been shown to play an important role in
proliferation, differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells. Although some postreceptor signaling events of Flt3 have been
characterized, the involvement of Gab family proteins in Flt3 signaling is not
known. In this study, we show that both Gab1 and Gab2 are rapidly tyrosine
phosphorylated after Flt3 ligand stimulation of Flt3 ligand-responsive cells.
They interact with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shp-2, p85, Grb2, and Shc. The results
suggest that Gab proteins are engaged in Flt3 signaling to mediate downstream
activation of Shp-2 and PI3 kinase pathways and possibly the Ras/Raf/MAPK
pathway.
