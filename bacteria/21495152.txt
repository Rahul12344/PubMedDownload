BACKGROUND: The U.K. government has published plans to reduce U.K. agriculture's 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. At the same time, the goal of global food
security requires an increase in arable crop yields. Foliar disease control
measures such as fungicides have an important role in meeting both objectives.
RESULTS: It is estimated that U.K. winter barley production is associated with
GHG emissions of 2770 kg CO2 eq. ha(-1) of crop and 355 kg CO2 eq. t(-1) of
grain. Foliar disease control by fungicides is associated with decreases in GHG
emissions of 42-60 kg CO2 eq. t(-1) in U.K. winter barley and 29-39 kg CO2 eq.
t(-1) in U.K. spring barley. The sensitivity of these results to the impact of
disease control on yield and to variant GHG emissions assumptions is presented.
Fungicide treatment of the major U.K. arable crops is estimated to have directly 
decreased U.K. GHG emissions by over 1.5 Mt CO2 eq. in 2009.
CONCLUSION: Crop disease control measures such as fungicide treatment reduce the 
GHG emissions associated with producing a tonne of grain. As national demand for 
food increases, greater yields as a result of disease control also decrease the
need to convert land from non-arable to arable use, which further mitigates GHG
emissions.
