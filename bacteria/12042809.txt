CD1d-restricted T cells are implicated as key players in host defense against
various microbial infections. However, the mechanisms involved and the role they 
play, if any, at the mucosal surfaces where pathogenic infections are initiated
is unknown. In a murine pneumonia model established by intranasal application of 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, CD1d(-/-) mice showed markedly reduced pulmonary
eradication of P. aeruginosa compared with wild-type mice; this was associated
with significantly lower amounts of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and reduced
numbers of neutrophils within the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Corollarily,
treatment of mice with alpha-galactosylceramide--a lipid that activates
CD1d-restricted T cells--increased the amount of interferon-gamma; this was
associated with rapid pulmonary clearance through enhanced phagocytosis of P.
aeruginosa by alveolar macrophages. These results reveal a crucial role played by
CD1d-restricted T cells in regulating the antimicrobial immune functions of
macrophages at the lung mucosal surface.
