[Mechanisms of action of chemoantibiotics (author's transl)].

[Article in Italian]

Gargani G.

An useful drug for infectious diseases should have a selective antimicrobial
activity and no action on animal cell. The general target, besides some very
restricted process like in M. tuberculosis, are: 1) purine synthesis, 2) DNA
replication, 3) protein synthesis, 4) cell-wall synthesis, 5) cytoplasmic
membrane. On purine synthesis are active the sulphamidic on DNA replication
nalidixic acid on Gram-negative bacteria, and griseophulvin on dermatophites.
Many drugs have their target in the sequential stages of protein synthesis, among
these the aminoglycosides are mainly bactericidal. The antibiotics which block
the building of cell-wall are the best, according the target does not exist in
animal cell; among them, penicillins and cephalosporins are bactericidal. On
contrary cytoplasmic membrane, which is similar to the animal cell membrane has
to be evaluated as a bad target. Polimyxins on bacteria, polyene antibiotics on
fungi, have this target and are bactericidal, but their use is restricted for
toxicity. Antibiotics must be selected in therapy according to their mechanism of
action and to the immunological state of the patient. Some bactericidal
antibiotics have to be reserved for immuno suppressed people.
