The gastrointestinal form of Chagas disease is characterized by lumenal
enlargement and wall thickening of the esophagus and/or colon. Very little is
known about the involvement of the immune system in the development of the
gastrointestinal form of the disease. In this paper we describe our initial
observations on the phenotypic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
from patients with the gastrointestinal form of Chagas disease. A significant
decrease in the absolute number of CD3(+) T cells as well as in CD19(+) B
lymphocytes was observed. However, the most striking observation was an inversion
of the CD4/CD8 ratio, contrasting with results from cardiac chagasic patients in 
whom the ratio is normal. A decrease of the percentage of CD4(+)CD28(+) cells and
an increase in the expression of HLA-DR both on CD4(+) and on CD8(+) cells
suggest that although these T cells express activation markers their function may
be altered by the lack of CD28 expression.
