Several angiopoietin-like (ANGPTL) molecules have been implicated in enhancement 
of ex-vivo expansion of murine and human (hu) hematopoietic stem cells, but there
are no reports on hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). We assessed purified
recombinant endotoxin-free hu ANGPTL-2 Coiled-Coil (CC), -3, -3CC, -3
fibrinogen-like domain (FLD), -4, -4CC, -5CC, -6 and -7 for effects on
proliferation and survival of HPCs from hu cord blood (CB). None of the ANGPTL
molecules stimulated CB HPC proliferation, or enhanced or inhibited colony
formation of CB HPC stimulated by various growth factors. However, ANGPTL-2CC,
-3, and -3CC significantly enhanced survival of HPC (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-GEMM)
subjected to delayed addition of growth factors. Survival enhancing effects of
ANGPTL-3 were neutralized by purified anti-ANGPTL-3, but not by anti-ANGPTL-4,
-6, or -7. ANGPTL-2CC, -3, and -3CC, but not -4, -6, or -7 also enhanced
replating capacity of single CB CFU-GEMM colonies, an estimate of the
self-renewal capabilities of HPCs, by greater than 2 fold. Effects of at least
ANGPTL-3CC may in part be mediated through phosphorylation of ERK. The ANGPTL
molecules did not influence ex-vivo expansion of hu CB CD34(+) cells, alone, or
in combination with SCF, TPO, Flt3-ligand, with or without IL-3. Thus, among
ANGPTL family members, ANGPTL-2 and -3 had enhancing activities on human HPC
survival and replating activity, effects requiring the CC domain of the ANGPTL
molecules. This information is of relevance to hu HPC regulation.
