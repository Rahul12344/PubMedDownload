BACKGROUND: The recruitment of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+T (Treg) cells is one of the most
important mechanisms by which parasites down-regulate the immune system.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the effects of Treg cells from
Trichinella spiralis-infected mice and uninfected mice on experimental allergic
airway inflammation in order to understand the functions of parasite-induced Treg
cells. After four weeks of T. spiralis infection, we isolated
Foxp3-GFP-expressing cells from transgenic mice using a cell sorter. We injected 
CD4+Foxp3+ cells from T. spiralis-infected [Inf(+)Foxp3+] or uninfected
[Inf(-)Foxp3+] mice into the tail veins of C57BL/6 mice before the induction of
inflammation or during inflammation. Inflammation was induced by ovalbumin
(OVA)-alum sensitization and OVA challenge. The concentrations of the Th2-related
cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and the
levels of OVA-specific IgE and IgG1 in the serum were lower in mice that received
intravenous application of Inf(+)Foxp3+ cells [IV(inf):+(+) group] than in
control mice. Some features of allergic airway inflammation were ameliorated by
the intravenous application of Inf(-)Foxp3+ cells [IV(inf):+(-) group], but the
effects were less distinct than those observed in the IV(inf):+(+) group. We
found that Inf(+)Foxp3+ cells migrated to inflammation sites in the lung and
expressed higher levels of Treg-cell homing receptors (CCR5 and CCR9) and
activation markers (Klrg1, Capg, GARP, Gzmb, OX40) than did Inf(-)Foxp3+ cells.
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: T. spiralis infection promotes the proliferation and
functional activation of Treg cells. Parasite-induced Treg cells migrate to the
inflammation site and suppress immune responses more effectively than
non-parasite-induced Treg cells. The adoptive transfer of Inf(+)Foxp3+ cells is
an effective method for the treatment and prevention of allergic airway diseases 
in mice and is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergic
airway diseases.
