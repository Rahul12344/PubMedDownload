Skin leishmaniasis includes lesions of different appearance, shape, and severity,
spanning from alarming diffuse lesions to an asymptomatic course. Moreover,
aspecific presentation, as well as challenging differential diagnosis of
cutaneous leishmaniasis, may request more in-depth investigations on the
intriguing and complex pathogenesis of such infection. A 7-year case of worsening
cutaneous leishmaniasis in the left frontoparietal region of the scalp, achieving
omolateral eyebrow, in a 68-year-old male patient prompted us to address the
immunity profile of peripheral blood lymphocytes. An increase of regulatory
CD19+/CD38bright/CD24bright B cell lymphocytes was observed at the front of
normal levels of other lymphocytes subpopulations, including CD4+/CD25bright T
cells. The total IgG and IgM, as well as proinflammatory subclasses of IgG, were 
below the normal range. However, IgG4 subclass was found normal. In conclusion,
our data may indicate inhibition of humoral immunity associated with an increase 
of lymphocyte B-regulatory subpopulation.
