Objectives: To compare immunohistochemical expression of CD34 and CD105 in oral
submucous fibrosis (OSF) and normal oral mucosa (NOM) and correlate with
clinicopathological features of OSF.
Materials and Methods: Total of thirty clinically diagnosed and histologically
confirmed cases of OSF and 15 NOM were included in the study. Tissues sections
were immunostained using CD34 and CD105 antibodies.
Results: Twenty-eight cases (93.33%) were positive for CD34, and only 12 cases
(40%) were positive for CD105 in OSF. In NOM all cases were positive for CD34 and
only one case was positive for CD105. CD34 and CD105 significantly expressed in
moderately advanced OSF when compared to very early, early, and advanced cases.
It was found that the microvessel density (MVD) in NOM was significantly higher
as compared to OSF and MVD decreased with advanced OSF. MVD was higher in CD34
when compared to CD105. MVD decreased with disease progression in OSF using both 
the markers.
Conclusion: The role of CD34 in determining the premalignant nature of OSF could 
not be ascertained, since all endothelial cells were positive for CD34, whereas
CD105 appeared to be more specific as it is associated with hypoxia-induced
angiogenesis which is occurring in OSF due to hyalinization suggesting, CD105 to 
be more specific marker to determine neoangiogenesis in OSF. Thus further
follow-up study of the cases positive for CD105 is required to determine the true
nature of angiogenesis in OSF patients.
