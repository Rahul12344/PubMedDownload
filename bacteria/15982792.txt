In the present study, we performed in silico analysis of Chlamydia pneumoniae
genome sequence to identify human HLA-A2-restricted T cell epitopes. Thirty-one
Chlamydia-specific protein antigens were selected and peptides were derived
thereof using an HLA-A2 epitope predictive algorithm. Firstly, we tested binding 
of 55 selected 9mer peptides to HLA-A2 in vitro. Next, infection of HLA-A2
transgenic mice with C. pneumoniae elementary bodies and assessment of effector
CD8+ T cells allowed us to identify which of the epitopes binding to HLA-A2 in
vitro were recognized by C. pneumoniae infection-primed CD8+ T cells. Finally, we
could confirm that CD8+ T cells in association with HLA-A2 recognized the most
reactive peptides when the corresponding full-length genes were used to
DNA-immunize HLA-A2 transgenic mice. By using this approach, a novel
HLA-A2-restricted epitope in the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of C. pneumoniae
was identified, which proved to mediate specific lysis of peptide-loaded target
cells.
