Biogenesis of translation-competent 80S ribosomes is a multi-step process
requiring the sequential action of non-ribosomal trans-acting factors. We
previously identified the human PELP1-TEX10-WDR18 complex and the associated SUMO
isopeptidase SENP3 as regulators of 60S maturation. We provided evidence that
deconjugating SUMO from PELP1 by SENP3 is instrumental for proper ribosome
biogenesis. Here we show that SUMO conjugation/deconjugation of PELP1 controls
its dynamic association with the AAA ATPase MDN1, a key factor of pre-60S
remodeling. We demonstrate that modification of PELP1 promotes the recruitment of
MDN1 to pre-60S particles, while deSUMOylation is needed to release both MDN1 and
PELP1 from pre-ribosomes. Inactivation of SENP3 traps MDN1 at pre-60S particles
and prevents critical remodeling events, ultimately generating aberrant pre-60S
complexes. We define MDN1 as a SUMO-targeted AAA ATPase, and we propose that a
controlled SUMO cycle on PELP1 serves as regulatory point for mammalian 60S
maturation through ordered recruitment and release of MDN1.
