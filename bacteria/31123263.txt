The wheat Pm3 resistance gene against the powdery mildew pathogen occurs as an
allelic series encoding functionally different immune receptors which induce
resistance upon recognition of isolate-specific avirulence (AVR) effectors from
the pathogen. Here, we describe the identification of five effector proteins from
the mildew pathogens of wheat, rye, and the wild grass Dactylis glomerata,
specifically recognized by the PM3B, PM3C and PM3D receptors. Together with the
earlier identified AVRPM3A2/F2, the recognized AVRs of PM3B/C, (AVRPM3B2/C2), and
PM3D (AVRPM3D3) belong to a large group of proteins with low sequence homology
but predicted structural similarities. AvrPm3b2/c2 and AvrPm3d3 are conserved in 
all tested isolates of wheat and rye mildew, and non-host infection assays
demonstrate that Pm3b, Pm3c, and Pm3d are also restricting the growth of rye
mildew on wheat. Furthermore, divergent AVR homologues from non-adapted rye and
Dactylis mildews are recognized by PM3B, PM3C, or PM3D, demonstrating their
involvement in host specificity.
