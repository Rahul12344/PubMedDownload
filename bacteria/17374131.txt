Campylobacter jejuni is recognized as the most common identifiable pathogen
associated with the development of Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), an acute
autoimmune-mediated disease affecting the peripheral nervous system. The immune
response to ganglioside-like structures in lipo-oligosaccharides (LOSs) of
certain C. jejuni strains is thought to cross-react with human nerve gangliosides
and induce GBS. To study the involvement of LOSs in the pathogenesis of
Campylobacter-induced GBS, we created truncated LOS molecules by inactivating the
waaF gene in a GBS-associated isolate of C. jejuni. Gas Chromatography-MS
analysis of the waaF mutant LOSs revealed a marked reduction in sugar content,
including sialic acid and galactose. GM1 and GD1a-like mimicry was not detected
in the waaF mutant by Western blot analysis with cholera toxin B and anti-GD1a
antibodies. Mice immunized with the waaF mutant failed to develop anti-GM1 or
anti-GD1a antibodies. The waaF mutant also showed reduced adherence to and
invasion of INT-407 cells. The results indicate that the LOS of C. jejuni HB93-13
is essential for adherence and invasion as well as for anti-ganglioside antibody 
induction.
