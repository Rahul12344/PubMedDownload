Comparisons of the inhibitory activities of different tetracyclines have been
reported for Plasmodium falciparum but no other parasites. The in vitro response 
of the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia to six tetracyclines in current use
was determined. In addition, the experimental drug thiacycline (EMD 33,330) was
evaluated. Three groups were discerned, with representative 50 and 90% inhibitory
concentrations of, respectively, 36 and 130 (tetracycline), 6.4 and 22
(doxycycline), and 1.8 and 3.4 (thiacycline) micrograms/ml. These dramatic
differences in activity correlate with increased lipophilicity.
