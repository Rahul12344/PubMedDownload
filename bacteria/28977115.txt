BACKGROUND: As being the first bacteria determined to be carcinogenic,
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a pathogen localized in the stomach in more
than half of the world population. Some earlier studies have found a relation
between tissue histocompatibility antigens and gastric cancers depending on the
regions.
OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the distribution of human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens in H. pylori-positive
pediatric patients with active gastritis and duodenal ulcer, excluding cancer
cases, in our center.
METHODS: The study included 40 patients diagnosed with H. pylori-positive active 
gastritis and duodenal ulcer and 100 controls consisting of healthy donor
candidates. The HLA class I and class II antigens were studied in the isolated
DNA samples using the polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific oligonucleotide
probes.
RESULTS: The frequency of HLA-B*51 antigen was significantly higher in the
patient group than in the control group (40% vs 17%; P=0.003). There was no
difference between the two groups in terms of the frequencies of HLA-A, HLA-C,
HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ antigens.
CONCLUSION: It was determined that HLA-B*51 plays a critical role in H. pylori
infection.
