Serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are members of the
pentraxin protein family. SAP is the precursor protein to amyloid P component
present in all forms of amyloidosis. The prevailing notion is that SAP in
circulation has the form of a double pentameric molecule (decamer) whereas CRP is
a single pentameric molecule. We have investigated by gel permeation
chromatography the M(r) of SAP in freshly collected human serum and of SAP
purified by carbohydrate affinity chromatography and anion exchange
chromatography. SAP was monitored by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis and
ELISA, and SAP peak fractions were analysed by use of SDS-PAGE, Western blotting,
and electron microscopy. The results indicate that native SAP circulates as a
single pentamer, a part of which forms complexes with C4b-binding protein. The
properties of SAP changed during purification as indicated by rocket
immunoelectrophoresis and electron microscopy. Thus, electron micrographs of
purified SAP showed a predominance of decamers. However, the decamer form of SAP 
reversed to single pentamers when purified SAP was incorporated into SAP-depleted
serum.
