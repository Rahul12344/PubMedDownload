PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) regulated adaptor molecule 1 (PRAM-1)
is an intracellular adaptor molecule that is upregulated during the induced
granulocytic differentiation of promyelocytic leukemic cells and during normal
human myelopoiesis. This report describes the generation of PRAM-1-deficient mice
and an analysis of the function of this adaptor in neutrophil differentiation and
mature neutrophil function. We demonstrate here that neutrophil differentiation
is not impaired in PRAM-1-deficient mice and that PRAM-1-deficient neutrophils
function normally following engagement of Fcgamma receptors. In contrast, mature 
PRAM-1-null neutrophils exhibit significant defects in adhesion-dependent
reactive oxygen intermediate production and degranulation. Surprisingly, other
integrin-dependent responses, such as cell spreading and activation of several
signaling pathways, are normal. Together, these findings demonstrate the
uncoupling of key integrin-dependent responses in the absence of PRAM-1 and show 
this adaptor to be critical for select integrin functions in neutrophils.
