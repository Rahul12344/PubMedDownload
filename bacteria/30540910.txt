The F9/Yde/Fml pilus, tipped with the FmlH adhesin, has been shown to provide
uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) a fitness advantage in urinary tract
infections (UTIs). Here, we used X-ray structure guided design to optimize our
previously described ortho-biphenyl Gal and GalNAc FmlH antagonists such as
compound 1 by replacing the carboxylate with a sulfonamide as in 50. Other groups
which can accept H-bonds were also tolerated. We pursued further modifications to
the biphenyl aglycone resulting in significantly improved activity. Two of the
most potent compounds, 86 (IC50 = 0.051 μM) and 90 (IC50 = 0.034 μM), exhibited
excellent metabolic stability in mouse plasma and liver microsomes but showed
only limited oral bioavailability (<1%) in rats. Compound 84 also showed a good
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in mice after IP dosing with compound exposure above
the IC50 for 6 h. These new FmlH antagonists represent new antivirulence drugs
for UTIs.
