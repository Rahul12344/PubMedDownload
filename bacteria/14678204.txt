In some chronic pathological conditions, antigen persistence activates and
expands the CD4+ CD57+ T-cell subset. The host immune response against
tuberculosis infection is maintained through the continuous presence of
antigen-stimulated effector/memory helper T cells. To determine whether CD4+
CD57+ T cells were also expanded in human tuberculosis, we analysed (by flow
cytometry) the phenotype of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from 30 tuberculosis
patients and 30 healthy controls. We observed a significant increase in the CD4+ 
CD57+ T-cell subset in tuberculosis patients in comparison to healthy controls (P
< 0.001). Most CD4+ CD57+ T cells exhibited a CD28- CD45RO+ CD62L- phenotype,
which is associated with memory cells. In vitro, a higher number of
antigen-stimulated CD4+ CD57+ T cells produced intracellular interferon-gamma and
interleukin-4 compared with antigen-stimulated CD4+ CD57- T cells (P < 0.001).
These findings suggest that the majority of CD4+ CD57+ T cells correspond to a
phenotype of activated memory T cells.
