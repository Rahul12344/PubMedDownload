Lower genital tract infections caused by both sexually and not-sexually
transmitted pathogens in women are a key public health priority worldwide,
especially in developing countries. Since standard analyses are time-consuming,
appropriate therapeutic intervention is often neglected or delayed. Lab-on-chips 
and biosensors open new perspectives and offer innovative tools to simplify the
diagnosis by medical staff, especially in countries with inadequate resources.
Here we report a biosensing platform based on Electrochemical Impedance
Spectroscopy (EIS) that allows multiplexed detection of Candida albicans,
Streptococcus agalactiae and Chlamydia trachomatis with a single biochip,
enabling a quick screening thanks to the presence of different immobilized
antibodies, each specific for one of the different target pathogens.
