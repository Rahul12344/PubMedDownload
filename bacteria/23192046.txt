TktA is the most critical enzyme in the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway.
It catalyzes the conversion of xylulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate into
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and its products are
used in the biosynthesis of acetyl-CoA, aromatic amino acids, nucleic acids and
ADP-L-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose. TktA also has an unexpected role in chromosome
structure that is independent of its metabolic responsibilities. Therefore, it is
a new potent antibiotic target. In this study, TktA from Burkholderia
pseudomallei has been cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. Synchrotron
X-ray data were also collected to 2.0 Å resolution. The crystal belonged to the
monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=146.2, b=74.6, c=61.6 Å,
β=113.0°. A full structural determination is under way in order to provide
insight into the structure-function relationship of this protein.
