A point mutation (E115K) resulting in slower growth of Escherichia coli DH5alpha 
and XL1-Blue in minimal media was identified in the purB gene, coding for
adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL), through complementation with an E. coli K-12
genomic library and serial subcultures. Chromosomal modification reversing the
mutation to the wild type restored growth phenotypes in minimal media.
