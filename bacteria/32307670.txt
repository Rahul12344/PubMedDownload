BACKGROUND: The present study aims to clarify the effects of weight loss on
biomarkers associated with angiogenesis in patients who underwent laparoscopic
sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in the 12-month
follow-up study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 24 obese patients who underwent laparoscopic
weight loss surgery, 13 of whom underwent SG and 11 of whom underwent LAGB. We
evaluated the circulating level of angiogenesis biomarkers preoperatively and
12 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Before surgery, the following angiogenic circulating factors were
significantly higher than those of healthy subjects: angiopoietin 2 (ANG-2)
(p < .05), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (p < .05), hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) (p < .01), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule
(PECAM-1) (p < .01), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (p < .05). The
following angiogenesis biomarkers decreased significantly after weight loss
compared with their baseline values: ANG-2 (p < .05), follistatin (p < .05), HGF 
(p < .01), PECAM-1 (p < .01), and VEGF (p < .05). There were no significant
differences in the circulating levels of angiogenesis biomarkers between
individuals who underwent SG and those who underwent LAGB; however, HGF, PECAM-1,
and VEGF tended to be lower after SG. %BMI correlated negatively with HGF,
PECAM-1, and VEGF. A similar significant negative correlation was found for %WL
and %EWL. WHR correlated with PDGF-B and VEGF.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that weight loss surgery induces the changes of
circulating levels of angiogenesis biomarkers in obese patients. The changes in
angiogenesis status in obese patients who lost weight after bariatric surgery
depended on the amount of weight loss.
