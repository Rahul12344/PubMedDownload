Three T cell populations can be distinguished based on their response to antigen 
receptor engagement. A sizable fraction dies within hours of TCR ligation, a
smaller fraction enters the mitotic cycle, and the remaining T cells merely
upregulate the expression of certain cell surface markers. An MHC-I-controlled
regulatory mechanism has been identified. MHC I MAbs, or Fab fragments, prevent T
cells from mounting a proliferative mitogen response but do not inhibit the
mitogen-induced deletion of T cells. IFN-gamma enlarges the fraction of T cells
which proliferate in response to mitogen stimulation but, in the presence of MHC 
I MAb, these cells fail to clonally expand and enter the deletion pathway.
Phenotypically, MHC I MAb Fab fragments induce T cells to upregulate the
expression of the apoptosis marker CD95, even in the absence of TCR ligand, and
prevent the upregulation of costimulatory CD28 molecule expression.
