Although Pleurotus abalonus is a well-known edible mushroom in Asia, there is a
dearth of information on its antioxidant activity. The present report is the
first one focused on the purification and characterization of
9-beta-d-ribofuranosidoadenine (ADO), 5'-deoxy-5'-(methylthio) adenosine (MTA)
and a triterpenoid complex from P. abalonus. Different antioxidant activities
including inhibitory effects on hemolysis and lipid peroxidation in brain and
kidney homogenates as well as significant synergistic effect on scavenging of
hydroxyl radicals were demonstrated, which lays a foundation for the development 
of P. abalonus as a natural antioxidant applied in medicine.
