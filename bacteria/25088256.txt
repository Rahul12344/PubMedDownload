In vivo and in vitro effects of TIS21 gene on the mature T cell activation and
antitumor activities were explored by employing MO5 melanoma orthograft and
splenocytes isolated from the TIS21-knockout (KO)(2) mice. Proliferation and
survival of mature T cells were significantly increased in the KO than the wild
type (WT3)e cells, indicating that TIS21 inhibits the rate of mature T cell
proliferation and its survival. In MO5 melanoma orthograft model, the KO mice
recruited much more CD8(+) T cells into the tumors at around day 14 after tumor
cell injection along with reduced tumor volumes compared with the WT. The
increased frequency of granzyme B+ CD8+ T cells in splenocytes of the KO mice
compared with the WT may account for antitumor-immunity of TIS21 gene in the
melanoma orthograft. In contrast, reduced frequencies of CD107a+ CD8+ T cells in 
the splenocytes of KO mice may affect the loss of CD8+ T cell infiltration in the
orthograft at around day 19. These results indicate that TIS21 exhibits
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in mature T cells, and differentially 
affects the frequencies of granzyme B+ CD8+ T-cells and CD107a+ CD8+ T-cells,
thus transiently regulating in vivo anti-tumor immunity.
