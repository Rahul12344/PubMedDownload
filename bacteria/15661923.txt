Immaturity of innate immunity contributes to the increased susceptibility of
human neonates to infection. The lung is a major portal of entry for potential
pathogens in the neonate, and human beta-defensins (HBDs) and LL-37 participate
in pulmonary innate immunity. We hypothesized that these antimicrobial factors
would be developmentally regulated, expressed by neonatal pulmonary tissues, and 
participate in neonatal innate immunity. We found HBD-2 to be the predominant
beta-defensin in human neonatal lung. HBD-2 mRNA expression was developmentally
regulated, induced by the proinflammatory factor IL-1beta, and decreased by
dexamethasone. Additionally, HBD-2 abundance in neonatal tracheal aspirates
increased as a function of gestational age. HBD-1 had a lower level of expression
compared with HBD-2 and was induced by dexamethasone. HBD-3 and LL-37 messages
were not detected in airway epithelial cultures. Additionally, each antimicrobial
peptide exhibited a unique spectrum of antimicrobial activity and salt
sensitivity against bacteria commonly causing sepsis in the neonate. Lower levels
of HBD-2 may be one factor contributing to the increased susceptibility of
premature infants to pulmonary infections.
