Interleukin-17 contributes to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)
and chronic periodontitis (CP). We analyzed IL-17A -197A/G and IL-17F +7488C/T
polymorphisms in T1DM and CP and determined their associations with IL-17
production and occurrence of periopathogens. Totally 154 controls, 125 T1DM, and 
244 CP patients were genotyped using 5' nuclease TaqMan(Â®) assays. Bacterial
colonization was investigated by a DNA-microarray kit. Production of IL-17 after 
in vitro stimulation of mononuclear cells by mitogens and bacteria was examined
by the Luminex system. Although no differences in the allele/genotype frequencies
between patients with CP and T1DM + CP were found, the IL-17A -197 A allele
increased the risk of T1DM (P < 0.05). Levels of HbA1c were significantly
elevated in carriers of the A allele in T1DM patients (P < 0.05). Production of
IL-17 by mononuclear cells of CP patients (unstimulated/stimulated by
Porphyromonas gingivalis) was associated with IL-17A A allele (P < 0.05). IL-17A 
polymorphism increased the number of Tannerella forsythia and Treponema denticola
in patients with CP and T1DM + CP, respectively (P < 0.05). IL-17A gene
variability may influence control of T1DM and the "red complex" bacteria
occurrence in patients with CP and T1DM + CP. Our findings demonstrated the
functional relevance of the IL-17A polymorphism with higher IL-17 secretion in
individuals with A allele.
