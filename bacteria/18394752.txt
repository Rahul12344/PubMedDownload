We describe the investigation and containment of an outbreak of pertussis on a
neonatal unit. Bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology
were used to confirm suspected cases. Two infants with pertussis were identified 
and a nurse with prolonged cough was traced as the likely source. Control
interventions included mass chemoprophylaxis of healthcare workers and patients
and exclusion from work of healthcare workers with cough. The use of PCR allowed 
rapid assessment of the extent of the outbreak. This outbreak highlights the risk
to hospitalised infants posed by circulation of Bordetella pertussis in young
adults and illustrates the utility of PCR in rapidly assessing the extent of
outbreaks. Prevention strategies such as universal vaccination of adolescents, or
selective vaccination of healthcare workers, should be considered in the UK.
