NKT cells, a unique subset of T cells that recognizes glycolipid antigens
presented by CD1d molecules, are believed to produce key cytokines of both Th1
and Th2 T cells and are thus involved in the control of several types of immune
response. As an active glycolipid antigen having α-galactosyl ceramide core
structure, KRN7000 showed promising immunostimulation activity and was selected
as an anticancer drug candidate for further clinical application. In this report,
three new KRN7000 structural analogues were designed and synthesized, in which
the ring oxygen of the galactopyranose residue is replaced by a sulfur atom along
with the variation on the lipid chain. Their abilities for stimulating mouse NKT 
cells to produce IFN-γ and IL-4 were evaluated both in vivo and in vitro.
