Microorganisms in the placenta have been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes as 
well as neonatal illness. Inflammation in the placenta has been identified as a
contributing factor in this association, but the underlying biological mechanisms
are not yet fully understood. The placental epigenome may serve as an
intermediate between placental microbes and inflammation, contributing to adverse
outcomes in the offspring. In the present study, genome-wide DNA methylation (n =
486,428 CpG sites) of 84 placentas was analyzed in relation to 16 species of
placental microorganisms using samples collected from the Extremely Low Gestation
Age Newborns (ELGAN) cohort. A total of n = 1,789 CpG sites, corresponding to n =
1,079 genes, displayed differential methylation (q<0.1) in relation to
microorganisms. The altered genes encode for proteins that are involved in
immune/inflammatory responses, specifically the NF-ÎºB signaling pathway. These
data support bacteria-dependent epigenetic patterning in the placenta and provide
potential insight into mechanisms that associate the presence of microorganisms
in the placenta to pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. This study lays the
foundation for investigations of the placental microbiome and its role in
placental function.
