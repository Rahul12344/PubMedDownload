E. coli AlkB and human ALKBH2 belong to the AlkB family enzymes, which contain
several α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that repair
alkylated DNA. Specifically, the AlkB enzymes catalyze decarboxylation of α-KG to
generate a high-valent Fe(IV)-oxo species that oxidizes alkyl groups on DNA
adducts. AlkB and ALKBH2 have been reported to differentially repair select
etheno adducts, with preferences for 1,N6-ethenoadenine (1,N6-εA) and
3,N4-ethenocytosine (3,N4-εC) over 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-εG). However,
N2,3-ethenoguanine (N2,3-εG), the most common etheno adduct, is not repaired by
the AlkB enzymes. Unfortunately, a structural understanding of the differential
activity of E. coli AlkB and human ALKBH2 is lacking due to challenges acquiring 
atomistic details for a range of substrates using experiments. This study uses
both molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and ONIOM(QM:MM) calculations to
determine how the active site changes upon binding each etheno adduct and
characterizes the corresponding catalytic impacts. Our data reveal that the
preferred etheno substrates (1,N6-εA and 3,N4-εC) form favorable interactions
with catalytic residues that situate the lesion near the Fe(IV)-oxo species and
permit efficient oxidation. In contrast, although the damage remains correctly
aligned with respect to the Fe(IV)-oxo moiety, repair of 1,N2-εG is mitigated by 
increased solvation of the active site and a larger distance between Fe(IV)-oxo
and the aberrant carbons. Binding of non-substrate N2,3-εG in the active site
disrupts key DNA-enzyme interactions, and positions the aberrant carbon atoms
even further from the Fe(IV)-oxo species, leading to prohibitively high barriers 
for oxidative catalysis. Overall, our calculations provide the first structural
insight required to rationalize the experimentally-reported substrate
specificities of AlkB and ALKBH2 and thereby highlight the roles of several
active site residues in the repair of etheno adducts that directly correlates
with available experimental data. These proposed catalytic strategies can likely 
be generalized to other α-KG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that play similar
critical biological roles, including epigenetic and post-translational
regulation.
