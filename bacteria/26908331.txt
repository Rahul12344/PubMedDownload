Antigen presenting cells (APC) are critical components of innate immunity and
consequently shape the adaptive response. Leukocyte Ig Like Receptors (LILR) are 
innate immune receptors predominantly expressed on myeloid cells. LILR can
influence the antigen presenting phenotype of monocytic cells to determine the
nature of T cell responses in infections including Mycobaterium leprae. We
therefore investigated the relevance of LILR in the context of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Real-time PCR studies indicated that the transcriptional profile of
the orphan receptor LILRB5 was significantly up-regulated following exposure to
mycobacteria. Furthermore, LILRA1 and LILRB5 were able to trigger signalling
through direct engagement of mycobacteria using tranfectant cells incorporating a
reporter system. We describe for the first time the expression of this receptor
on T cells, and highlight the potential relevance to mycobacterial recognition.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that crosslinking of this receptor on T cells
increases proliferation of cytotoxic, but not helper, T cells.
