Dephospho coenzyme A (depCoA) is the last intermediate for CoA biosynthesis, and 
it can be used as a transcription initiator to prepare CoA-linked RNA by in vitro
transcription. However, commercially available depCoA is expensive. We hereby
describe a simple and efficient enzymatic synthesis of depCoA in a single-step
from commercially available and inexpensive oxidized pantethine (Ox-Pan) and ATP.
A plasmid (pCoaDAa) was constructed to co-express and co-purify two enzymes
pantothenate kinase (PanK/coaA) and phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase
(PPAT/coaD). Starting from Ox-Pan and ATP, two different synthetic routes of
one-pot reaction catalyzed by PanK and PPAT, followed by a simple column
purification step, afforded depCoA and its oxidized dimer (Ox-depCoA) with high
yields and purity. The simplicity and low cost of our method should make depCoA
easily accessible to a broad scientific community, and promote research on
CoA-related areas in biology and biomedicine.
