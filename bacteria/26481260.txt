Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) are innate-like non-conventional T 
cells restricted by the CD1d molecule that are unique in their ability to play a 
pivotal role in immune regulation. Deficient iNKT function has been reported in
patients receiving umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. We sought to
determine the effect of interleukin (IL)-15 on α-galactosylceramide
(α-GalCer)-expanded iNKT cell function from UCB and adult peripheral blood (APB) 
mononuclear cells (MNCs). Fresh APB and UCB MNCs were cultured with IL-15 (50
ng/ml) in the presence or absence of α-GalCer (100 ng/ml) for 10 days. Cells were
harvested for examination of cell yield, apoptosis, cytokine production and
cytotoxic function of Vα24(+)/Vβ11(+) iNKT cells. We observed that
α-GalCer-expanded APB and UCB iNKT cells and such expansion was further enhanced 
with IL-15. The percentage of CD3(+)CD56(+) NKT-like cells in both APB and UCB
MNCs was increased with IL-15 but not with α-GalCer. Apoptosis of UCB iNKT cells 
was ameliorated by IL-15. Although APB and UCB iNKT cells secreted lower IFN-γ,
it could be enhanced with IL-15. The expression of perforin in APB iNKT cells can
also be enhanced with IL-15. UCB Vα24(+)Vβ11(+) iNKT cells further augmented K562
cytotoxicity mediated by IL-15. Taken together, these results demonstrated the
relative functional deficiencies of α-GalCer induced UCB iNKT cells, which can be
ameliorated by IL-15. Our findings suggest a therapeutic benefit of IL-15
immunotherapy during the post-UCB transplant period when iNKT function remains
poor.
