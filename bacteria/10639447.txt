The ESAT-6 antigen from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a dominant target for
cell-mediated immunity in the early phase of tuberculosis (TB) in TB patients as 
well as in various animal models. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the
potential of ESAT-6 in an experimental TB vaccine. We started out using dimethyl 
dioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA), an adjuvant which has been demonstrated to be 
efficient for the induction of cellular immune responses and has been used
successfully before as a delivery system for TB vaccines. Here we demonstrate
that, whereas immune responses to both short-term-culture filtrate and Ag85B are 
efficiently induced with DDA, this adjuvant was inefficient for the induction of 
immune responses to ESAT-6. Therefore, we investigated the modulatory effect of
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), an immunomodulator which in different combinations 
has demonstrated strong adjuvant activity for both cellular and humoral immune
responses. We show in the present study that vaccination with ESAT-6 delivered in
a combination of MPL and DDA elicited a strong ESAT-6-specific T-cell response
and protective immunity comparable to that achieved with Mycobacterium bovis BCG.
