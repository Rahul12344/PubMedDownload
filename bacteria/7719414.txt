Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent hepatocyte mitogen in vitro, triggers
hepatocyte regeneration after partial hepatectomy and acute liver cell necrosis
induced by chemicals. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta 1 inhibits
hepatocyte proliferation in vitro and suppresses liver regeneration in vivo. We
assessed the expression of HGF and TGF beta 1 mRNA in an endotoxin-related
hepatic cell necrosis model. Intravenous injection of Gram-negative
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into rats previously given heat-killed Propionibacterium
acnes induced endotoxin-related hepatic cell necrosis. In this model, serum ALT
began to rise to more than 100IU as early as 3 h after LPS injection, reaching
300IU 12h after injection. HGF mRNA levels in the liver did not increase
significantly until 5h after LPS injection; at 12h, they had increased about
threefold compared with controls. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression increased threefold 
after P. acnes treatment alone and increased further after LPS injection. In the 
spleen, HGF mRNA levels increased within 3h, but in the lung no increase in HGF
mRNA was observed. Early elevation of liver TGF beta 1 mRNA levels and delayed
elevation of HGF mRNA levels, with low expression of HGF in the lung, may play a 
role in the pathogenesis of endotoxin-related hepatic necrosis.
