Natural products containing an o-dialkylbenzene moiety exhibit a wide variety of 
bioactivities, including antibacterial, antifungal, antitumor, and antiangiogenic
activities. However, the biosynthetic scheme of the o-dialkylbenzene moiety
remains unclear. In this study, we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC)
of compounds 1 and 2 in Streptomyces sp. SANK 60404, which contains a rare
o-dialkylbenzene moiety, and successfully reconstituted the biosynthesis of 1
using 22 recombinant enzymes in vitro. Our study established a biosynthetic route
for the o-tolyl group within the o-dialkylbenzene moiety, where the triene
intermediate 3 loaded onto a unique acyl carrier protein (ACP) is elongated by a 
specific ketosynthase-chain length factor pair of a type II polyketide synthase
system with the aid of a putative isomerase to be termed "electrocyclase" and a
thioesterase-like enzyme in the BGC. The C2-elongated all-trans diketo-triene
intermediate is subsequently isomerized to the 6Z configuration by the
electrocyclase to allow intramolecular 6π-electrocyclization, followed by
coenzyme FAD/FMN-dependent dehydrogenation. Bioinformatics analysis showed that
the key genes are all conserved in BGCs of natural products containing an
o-dialkylbenzene moiety, suggesting that the proposed biosynthetic scheme is a
common strategy to form o-dialkylbenzenes in nature.
