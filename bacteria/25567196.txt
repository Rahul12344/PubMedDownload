The effects of a new microorganism species (Bacillus spp., strain M3) isolated
from permafrost specimens from Central Yakutia (Mamontova Mountain) on the bone
marrow hemopoiesis were studied on laboratory mice. Analysis of the count and
immunophenotype of bone marrow cells indicated that even in low doses (1000-5000 
microbial cells) these microorganisms modulated hemopoiesis and lymphopoiesis
activity. The percentage of early hemopoietic precursors (CD117(+)CD34(-))
increased, intensity of lymphocyte precursor proliferation and differentiation
(CD25(+)CD44(-)) decreased, and the percentage of lymphocytes released from the
bone marrow (CD25(+)CD44(+)) increased on day 21 after injection of the bacteria.
These changes in activity of hemopoiesis were associated with changes in the
level of regulatory T lymphocytes (reduced expression of TCRαβ) and were most
likely compensatory. The possibility of modulating hemopoiesis activity in the
bone marrow by low doses of one microorganism strain isolated from the permafrost
could be useful for evaluating the effects of other low dose bacteria on the bone
marrow hemopoiesis.
