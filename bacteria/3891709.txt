A comparison of the in-vitro activity of antimicrobials against Chlamydia
trachomatis examined by Giemsa and a fluorescent antibody stain.

How SJ, Hobson D, Hart CA, Quayle E.

Minimum concentrations for the inhibition of normal chlamydial inclusions (MICN) 
and abnormal inclusions (MICA) were obtained for a range of antimicrobials
titrated against Chlamydia trachomatis in McCoy cell cultures. Each antibiotic
titrated produced an MICN which was the same whether examined by Giemsa or
fluorescent antibody staining methods (rifampicin 0.007 mg/l, tetracycline,
erythromycin and penicillin 0.062 mg/l, chloramphenicol and spiramycin 0.25 mg/l,
ciprofloxacin 1.0 mg/l, and cycloserine 250 mg/l). With the exception of
penicillin the MICA (Giemsa) was between two- and four-fold higher than the MICN,
and the MICA (fluorescent antibody) a further two-fold higher. Penicillin was
alone in the wide concentration range over which abnormal inclusions were
detected (0.0062 mg/l to 5 g/l).
