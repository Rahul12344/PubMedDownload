Lactoferrin (LF) and retinoic acid (RA) are enriched in colostrum, milk, and
mucosal tissues. We recently showed that LF-induced IgA class switching through
binding to betaglycan (transforming growth factor-beta receptor III, TβRIII) and 
activation of canonical TGF-β signaling. We investigated the combined effect of
LF and RA on the overall IgA response. An increase in IgA production by LF was
further augmented by RA. This combination effect was also evident in Ig germ-line
α (GLα) transcription and GLα promoter activity, indicating that LF in
cooperation with RA increased IgA isotype switching. We subsequently found that
RA enhanced TβRIII expression and that this increase contributed to LF-stimulated
IgA production. In addition to the IgA response, LF and RA in combination also
enhanced the expression of the gut-homing molecules C-C chemokine receptor 9
(CCR9) and α4β7 on B cells. Finally, peroral administration of LF and RA enhanced
the frequency of CCR9+IgA+ plasma cells in the lamina propria. Taken together,
these results suggest that LF in cooperation with RA can contribute to the
establishment of gut IgA responses.
