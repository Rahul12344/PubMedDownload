Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a unique sub-population of tumor cells with
the ability to initiate tumor growth and sustain self-renewal. Although CSC
biomarkers have been described for various tumors, only a few markers have been
identified for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, we show that CD24+ 
cells isolated from human NPC cell lines express stem cell genes (Sox2, Oct4,
Nanog, Bmi-1, and Rex-1), and show activation of the Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling
pathway. CD24+ cells possess typical CSC characteristics that include enhanced
cell proliferation, increased colony and sphere formation, maintenance of cell
differentiation potential in prolonged culture, and enhanced resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs. Notably, CD24+ cells produce tumors following inoculation
of as few as 500 cells in immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. CD24+ cells further show
increased invasion ability in vitro, which correlates with enhanced expression of
matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9. In summary, our results suggest that CD24
represents a novel CSC biomarker in NPC.
