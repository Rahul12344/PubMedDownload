BACKGROUND: Population external validity is the extent to which an experimental
study results can be generalized from a specific sample to a defined population. 
In order to apply the results of a study, we should be able to assess its
population external validity. We performed an investigator-initiated randomized
controlled trial (RCT) (AIDA study), which compared colistin-meropenem
combination therapy to colistin monotherapy in the treatment of patients infected
with carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In order to examine the study's
population external validity and to substantiate the use of AIDA study results in
clinical practice, we performed a concomitant observational trial.
METHODS: The study was conducted between October 1st, 2013 and January 31st, 2017
(during the RCTs recruitment period) in Greece, Israel and Italy. Patients
included in the observational arm of the study have fulfilled clinical and
microbiological inclusion criteria but were excluded from the RCT due to receipt 
of colistin for > 96 h, refusal to participate, or prior inclusion in the RCT.
Non-randomized cases were compared to randomized patients. The primary outcome
was clinical failure at 14 days of infection onset.
RESULTS: Analysis included 701 patients. Patients were infected mainly with
Acinetobacter baumannii [78.2% (548/701)]. The most common reason for exclusion
was refusal to participate [62% (183/295)]. Non-randomized and randomized
patients were similar in most of the demographic and background parameters,
though randomized patients showed minor differences towards a more severe
infection. Combination therapy was less common in non-randomized patients [31.9% 
(53/166) vs. 51.2% (208/406), p = 0.000]. Randomized patients received longer
treatment of colistin [13 days (IQR 10-16) vs. 8.5 days (IQR 0-15), p = 0.000].
Univariate analysis showed that non-randomized patients were more inclined to
clinical failure on day 14 from infection onset [82% (242/295) vs. 75.5%
(307/406), p = 0.042]. After adjusting for other variables, non-inclusion was not
an independent risk factor for clinical failure at day 14.
CONCLUSION: The similarity between the observational arm and RCT patients has
strengthened our confidence in the population external validity of the AIDA
trial. Adding an observational arm to intervention studies can help increase the 
population external validity and improve implementation of study results in
clinical practice.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01732250 on November 22, 2012.
