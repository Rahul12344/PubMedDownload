Neutrophils from pulmonary tuberculosis patients show augmented levels of
chemokines MIP-1α, IL-8 and MCP-1 which further increase upon in vitro infection 
with mycobacterial strains.

Neutrophils being innate cells initiate the immune defence against mycobacteria
by sending signals to other immune cells. Chemokines being the vital link in
signaling processes, it is of interest to study their secretion by neutrophils as
a response to tuberculosis infection. The levels of various chemokines (MIP-1α,
MCP-1, IL-8 and IP-10) and chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2 and CCR1) in
neutrophils from healthy individuals and pulmonary tuberculosis patients were
studied following infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains (clinical--S7
and S10 and laboratory--H37Rv). The release of MIP-1α, IL-8 and MCP-1 is found to
be greatly increased in patient neutrophils. Mycobacterial strains differentially
influenced neutrophils affecting the release of chemokines to different extent.
H37Rv significantly increased the release of MIP-1α and IL-8 in both normals and 
tuberculosis patients, while S10 up regulated only the release of MIP-1α in
patients. Thus, during tuberculosis, neutrophils undergo functional alteration to
combat infection. While H37Rv is greatly recognized by neutrophils and triggers
the release of chemokines, clinical strains by some means try to suppress immune 
activation of neutrophils in their favor.
