Protective antigen (PA) of anthrax toxin binds cellular receptors and forms pores
in target cell membranes, through which catalytic lethal factor (LF) and edema
factor (EF) are believed to translocate to the cytoplasm. Using patch clamp
electrophysiological techniques, we assayed pore formation by PA in real time on 
the surface of cultured cells. The membranes of CHO-K1 cells treated with
activated PA had little to no electrical conductivity at neutral pH (7.3) but
exhibited robust mixed ionic currents in response to voltage stimuli at pH 5.3.
Pore formation depended on specific cellular receptors and exhibited
voltage-dependent inactivation at large potentials (>60 mV). The pH requirement
for pore formation was receptor-specific as membrane insertion occurs at
significantly different pH values when measured in cells specifically expressing 
tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) or capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2),
the two known cellular receptors for anthrax toxin. Pores were inhibited by an
N-terminal fragment of LF and by micromolar concentrations of tetrabutylammonium 
ions. These studies demonstrated basic biophysical properties of PA pores in cell
membranes and served as a foundation for the study of LF and EF translocation in 
vivo.
