We report a case of a 65-year-old man with rare prostatic stromal sarcoma in
which suprapubital radical prostatectomy was performed, but neither chemotherapy 
nor radiation therapy were administered before or after the operation. The
well-circumscribed tumor, measuring 5 cm in diameter, showed a homogeneous white 
grayish cut surface with a hard consistency. Histopathologically, the tumor
consisted mainly of medium-sized rounded cells with a sarcomatous and epithelioid
appearance intermingled with collagen fiber. Hyalinized foci were also noted in
the tumor. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the tumor cells were diffusely
positive for vimentin and focally positive for progesterone receptor and CD34,
but not for EMA, cytokeratin or estrogen receptor. No recurrence or distant
metastasis of the tumor has occurred in 8 years of follow up. The tumor was
diagnosed as prostatic stromal sarcoma (PSS) showing epithelioid differentiation 
and of a progesterone-dependent nature. Possible favorable nature of the PSS
might be expected after complete resection.
