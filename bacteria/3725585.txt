A case of guttural pouch mycosis in a horse.

Krogh HV, Lundegaard HC.

A case of guttural pouch mycosis in an 11-year-old horse is described. The fungus
isolated was identified as Emericella nidulans. Housing under bad hygienic
conditions without ventilation for three years might have been a predisposing
factor.
