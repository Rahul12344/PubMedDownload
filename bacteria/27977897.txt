Membrane localization domain (MLD) was first proposed for a 4-helix-bundle motif 
in the crystal structure of the C1 domain of Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT).
This structure motif is also found in the crystal structures of several
clostridial glycosylating toxins (TcdA, TcdB, TcsL, and TcnA). The
Ras/Rap1-specific endopeptidase (RRSP) module of the multifunctional
autoprocessing repeats-in-toxins (MARTX) toxin produced by Vibrio vulnificus has 
sequence homology to the C1-C2 domains of PMT, including a putative MLD. We have 
determined the solution structure for the MLDs in PMT and in RRSP using solution 
state NMR. We conclude that the MLDs in these two toxins assume a 4-helix-bundle 
structure in solution.
