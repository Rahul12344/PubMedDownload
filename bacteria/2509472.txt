Sodium dependence of leucine transport, a measure of the Na+-coupled
leucine-isoleucine-valine II (LIV-II) transport system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
was compared between two wild-type strains, PAO and PML. The leucine transport
activity was saturated at 0.1 mM NaCl for PAO and at 5.0 mM for PML. From
kinetics experiments, the apparent Km value for Na+ with respect to leucine
transport was estimated to be 3 microM for PAO and 95 microM for PML. The Km
value for leucine was 6 microM for PAO and 13 microM for PML. The LIV-II carrier 
gene (braB) of PML was isolated for comparison of its amino acid sequence with
that of the PAO carrier cloned previously. The Km values for Na+ and leucine of
the cloned LIV-II carriers of PAO and PML expressed in LIV-II defective mutants
were similar to those in wild-type strains. Determination of the nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences of the LIV-II carrier gene of PML showed an amino
acid difference at position 292 between the PAO and PML carriers. The amino acid 
was threonine for PAO and alanine for PML. These results indicate that the
substitution of the amino acid at position 292 of the LIV-II carrier causes a
difference in the sodium requirement of the carriers of the PAO and PML strains.
