Neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 is required for innate and adaptive protective
immunity to the larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis in mice. The goal of the
present study was to determine the mechanism of CXCR2-mediated neutrophil
recruitment to S. stercoralis. Mice deficient in the receptor for IL-17A and
IL-17F, upstream mediators of CXCR2 ligand production, were infected with S.
stercoralis larvae; there was no difference in larval survival, neutrophil
recruitment, or production of CXCR2 ligands compared with wild type mice. In vivo
and in vitro stimulation of neutrophils with S. stercoralis soluble extract
resulted in significant neutrophil recruitment. In vitro assays demonstrated that
the recruitment functioned through both chemokinesis and chemotaxis, was specific
for CXCR2, and was a G protein-coupled response involving tyrosine kinase and
PI3K. Finally, neutrophil stimulation with S. stercoralis soluble extract induced
release of the CXCR2 ligands MIP-2 and KC from neutrophils, thereby potentially
enhancing neutrophil recruitment.
