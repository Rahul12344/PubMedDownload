Regulatory T cells (Tregs) express high levels of cell surface lymphotoxin alpha 
beta (LTα1β2) to activate the LT beta receptor (LTβR) on the lymphatic
endothelial cells (LECs), modulating LEC adhesion molecules, intercellular
junctions, and chemokines. We demonstrate a role for Tregs through this pathway
to condition the permissiveness of lymphatic endothelia for transendothelial
migration (TEM), thus gating leukocyte traffic. Human Tregs share the same
property with murine Tregs. Activation of TLR2 on Tregs during inflammation
specifically augments LTα1β2-LTβR signaling, which further enhances the
permissiveness of LECs to facilitate TEM. The conditioning of endothelia may
promote the resolution of inflammation by directing leukocytes out of tissues to 
lymphatic vessels and draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, Tregs interact with
lymphatic endothelia under homeostasis and inflammation and dictate endothelial
permissiveness and gating mechanisms for subsequent leukocyte migration through
endothelial barriers.
