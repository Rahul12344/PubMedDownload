Class IA phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinases (PI3-K) are important targets in cancer 
therapy and are essential to immune responses, particularly through costimulation
by CD28 and ICOS. Thus, small PI3-K inhibitors are likely candidates to immune
intervention. PIK-75 is an efficient inhibitor of the PI3-K p110alpha catalytic
subunits that suppresses tumor growth, and its effects on immune and autoimmune
responses should be studied. Here, we describe the effect of PIK-75 on different 
immune parameters in vitro and in vivo. PIK-75 at concentrations commonly used in
vitro (&#8805;0.1 &#956;M) inhibited T and B cell activation by Concanavalin A
and LPS, respectively, and survival of non-stimulated spleen cells. In naive CD4+
T lymphocytes, PIK-75 induced apoptosis of resting or activated cells that was
prevented by caspase inhibitors. At low nanomolar concentrations (&#8804;10 nM), 
PIK-75 inhibited naive CD4+ T cell proliferation, and IL-2 and IFN-gamma
production induced by anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28. In activated CD4+ T blasts
costimulated by ICOS, PIK-75 (less than 10 nM) inhibited IFN-gamma, IL-17A, or
IL-21 secretion. Furthermore, PIK-75 (20 mg/kg p.o.) suppressed clinical symptoms
in ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and inhibited
MOG-specific responses in vitro. Thus, PIK-75 is an efficient suppressor of EAE, 
modulating lymphocyte function and survival.
