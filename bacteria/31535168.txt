Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases
in children. Our study aimed to evaluate the peripheral blood B and T lymphocyte 
subpopulations in children with JIA. This case-control study included 20 children
with JIA as well as 20 healthy children with matching age and sex as a control
group. All patients included in the study were in activity as determined by
visual analog scale. In addition to complete clinical evaluation, basic
investigations, peripheral blood B and T lymphocyte subpopulations were done to
all participants by flow cytometry. JIA patients displayed a significant decrease
in IgM memory B lymphocytes, switched memory B lymphocytes, and total memory B
lymphocytes when compared to the healthy controls. The percentages of na√Øve B
lymphocytes were significantly increased in JIA patients than in controls. Total 
T lymphocytes, CD8+CD28null cells, and CD4+CD28null cells were significantly
increased in JIA patients as compared to controls. In conclusion; JIA patients
have an alteration in both B and T lymphocytes with the predisposition of memory 
cells which may have a role in sustaining the JIA disease activity.
