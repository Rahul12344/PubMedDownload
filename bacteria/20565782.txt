BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is more often used to treat ovarian cancer (OvCa), which
provides modest survival advantage primarily due to chemo-resistance and up
regulated anti-apoptotic machineries in OvCa cells. Therefore, targeting the
mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance in OvCa cell may improve
therapeutic outcomes. We have shown that ovarian cancer cells express CC
chemokine receptor-9 (CCR9). Others have also shown that CCL25, the only natural 
ligand for CCR9, up regulates anti-apoptotic proteins in immature T lymphocytes. 
Hence, it is plausible that CCR9-mediated cell signals might be involved in OvCa 
cell survival and inhibition of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In this study, we
investigated the potential role and molecular mechanisms of CCR9-mediated
inhibition of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OvCa cells.
METHODS: Cell proliferation, vibrant apoptosis, and TUNEL assays were performed
with or without cisplatin treatment in presence or absence of CCL25 to determine 
the role of the CCR9-CCL25 axis in cisplatin resistance. In situ Fast Activated
cell-based ELISA (FACE) assays were performed to determine anti-apoptotic
signaling molecules responsible for CCL25-CCR9 mediated survival.
RESULTS: Our results show interactions between CCR9 and CCL25 increased
anti-apoptotic signaling cascades in OvCa cells, which rescued cells from
cisplatin-induced cell death. Specifically, CCL25-CCR9 interactions mediated Akt,
activation as well as GSK-3beta and FKHR phosphorylation in a PI3K-dependent and 
FAK-independent fashion.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the CCR9-CCL25 axis plays an important role in
reducing cisplatin-induced apoptosis of OvCa cells.
