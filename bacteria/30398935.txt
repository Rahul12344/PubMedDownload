OBJECTIVE: To compare matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and the antiproteinase
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 in wound fluids and sera from
patients with chronic non-healing or acute healing wounds. In addition, the
functional consequences on MMP-9 activity and general gelatinase activity were
assessed.
METHOD: In this observational study, samples were collected from patients with
venous leg ulcers (VLUs), patients with type 2 diabetes with neuropathic foot
ulcers (DFUs), and from another cohort of VLU patients with sterile
split-thickness skin graft donor sites after autologous skin grafting, serving as
healing control wounds. MMP-9 and TIMP-1 concentrations were determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. MMP-9 and gelatinase activities were
determined in wound fluids in subsets of the patients.
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients took part in the study. No significant
differences in MMP-9 wound fluid levels were found among the three groups. TIMP-1
levels were markedly and significantly lower in the two chronic wound groups
resulting in a severely unbalanced MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio, especially notable in the 
VLU group and possibly in the elevated endogenous MMP-9 activity (p<0.01)
compared with the acute wound fluids. At least 20% of the chronic wound fluids
displayed atypical patterns on gelatin zymography and showed high general
gelatinase activity that was not inhibited by either TIMP-1 or by a gelatinase
inhibitor (AG3340). MMP-9 levels were higher in the sera of the patients with
type 2 diabetes.
CONCLUSION: We hypothesise that non-MMP proteinases contribute to matrix
destruction in a significant number of chronic wounds. Blocking the excessive
MMP-9 activity may be insufficient to normalise wound healing. The reasons and
effects of the very low TIMP-1 levels in chronic wounds need further
clarification.
