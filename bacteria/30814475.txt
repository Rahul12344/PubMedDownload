A successful colonization of different compartments of the human host requires
multifactorial contacts between bacterial surface proteins and host factors.
Extracellular matrix proteins and matricellular proteins such as thrombospondin-1
play a pivotal role as adhesive substrates to ensure a strong interaction with
pathobionts like the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus
aureus. The human glycoprotein thrombospondin-1 is a component of the
extracellular matrix and is highly abundant in the bloodstream during bacteremia.
Human platelets secrete thrombospondin-1, which is then acquired by invading
pathogens to facilitate colonization and immune evasion. Gram-positive bacteria
express a broad spectrum of surface-exposed proteins, some of which also
recognize thrombospondin-1. This review highlights the importance of
thrombospondin-1 as an adhesion substrate to facilitate colonization, and we
summarize the variety of thrombospondin-1-binding proteins of S. pneumoniae and
S. aureus.
