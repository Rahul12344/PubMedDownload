Following T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) engagement, rearrangement of the actin
cytoskeleton supports intracellular signal transduction and T-cell activation.
The non-catalytic region of the tyrosine kinase (Nck) molecule is an adapter
protein implicated in TCR-induced actin polymerization. Further, Nck is recruited
to the CD3ε subunit of the TCR upon TCR triggering. Here we examine the role of
actin polymerization in the recruitment of Nck to the TCR. To this end, Nck
binding to CD3ε was quantified in Jurkat cells using the proximity ligation
assay. We show that inhibition of actin polymerization using cytochalasin D
delayed the recruitment of Nck1 to the TCR upon TCR triggering. Interestingly,
CD3ε phosphorylation was also delayed. These findings suggest that actin
polymerization promotes the recruitment of Nck to the TCR, enhancing downstream
signaling, such as phosphorylation of CD3ε.
