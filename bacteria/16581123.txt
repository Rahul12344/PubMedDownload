We investigated sequential cytokine addition on human hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) differentiation in murine fetal liver (FL), fetal spleen (FS) and bone
marrow (BM) organ cultures (OC). Tissues were colonized with unpurified or FACS
sorted CD34+CD38-CD10-CD19-CD3-CD8-CD4-(T- B-) cells from human cord blood
(HUCB). CD19+ cell production and kinetics differed in each tissue. Fetal liver
organ cultures (FLOC) inoculated with CD34+CD38-T-B- cells produced fewer CD19+
cells than fetal liver organ culture (FLOC) cultured with unpurified HUCB. CD19+ 
cell production was restored in the CD34+CD38-T-B- organ cultures by treating
with SCF, LIF and IL-6 followed by IL-7 and removing all cytokines for the last 3
days of culture (a six-fold increase). FLOC also produced CD34+CD38-T-B- cells
and monocyte-lineage CD33+CD14- cells, both of which increased after cytokine
treatment. Re-colonization of secondary FLOC with CD34+CD38-T-B- cells generated 
in primary FLOC produced additional B-cells, monocytes and CD34+CD38- cells
suggesting that the primary cells retained HSC activity. Expansion and
differentiation of HSCs depended on the microenvironment of the recipient tissue 
as well as addition of cytokines in the appropriate order.
