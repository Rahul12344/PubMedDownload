Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a kind of plant hormones that regulate many important 
agronomic traits. Although the framework of the BR signaling pathway has been
outlined, detailed working mechanisms at several steps of this pathway,
especially at the BR receptor level, need to be further elucidated. Recently we
have reported that a rice small G protein, OsPRA2, bound to the BR receptor
OsBRI1 at the plasma membrane (PM) and inhibited its kinase activity and its
interaction with the co-receptor OsBAK1, leading to a lower sensitivity to BR
treatment and dephosphorylation of OsBZR1. In this follow-up study, we identified
an OsPRA2-interacting protein through yeast 2 hybrid system, which is annotated
as a C2-domain containing GTPase activating protein (OsGAP1). Overexpression of
OsGAP1 in Arabidopsis resulted in a phenotype mimic to BR-deficiency, implying
that the GTPase activity of OsPRA2 is also involved in regulating BR signaling.
In addition, we observed that, besides colocalizing at the PM, OsPRA2 was also
colocalized with OsBRI1 in small granules near PM, suggesting that the function
of OsPRA2 in vesicle traffic may contribute to the regulation of OsBRI1.
