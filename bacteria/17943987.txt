Connectivity of the glycocalyx covering of small communities of Acidithiobacillus
ferrooxidans bacteria deposited on hydrophilic mica plates was imaged by atomic
force microscopy. When part of the coverage was removed by water rinsing, an
insoluble structure formed by corrals surrounding each individual bacterium was
observed. A collective ring structure with clustered bacteria (>or=3) was
observed, which indicates that the bacteria perceived the neighborhood in order
to grow a protective structure that results in smaller production of
exopolysaccharides material. The most surprising aspect of these collective
corral structures was that they occur at a low bacterial cell density. The
deposited layers were also analyzed by confocal Raman microscopy and shown to
contain polysaccharides, protein, and glucoronic acid.
