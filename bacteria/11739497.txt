T cell activation requires a threshold amount of TCR-mediated signals, an amount 
that is reduced by signals mediated through costimulatory molecules expressed on 
the T cell surface. Here the role of TNFR2 (p75) as a putative costimulatory
receptor for T cell activation was examined. It was found that p75 deficiency in 
CD8(+) T cells increased the requirements for TCR agonist approximately 5-fold.
Furthermore, p75(-/-) T cells display a marked reduction in the proliferative
response to TCR agonist. This hypoproliferative response was associated with
delayed kinetics of induction of the acute activation markers CD25 and CD69 as
well as a marked decrease in the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma. The net result
is that very few cells are recruited into the dividing population. Interestingly,
CD28 costimulation was only partially effective in rescuing the proliferative
defect of p75(-/-)CD8(+) T cells. Thus, p75 provides an important costimulatory
signal in addition to that provided by CD28 toward optimal T cell proliferation.
