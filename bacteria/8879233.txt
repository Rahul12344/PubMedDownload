Thymic selection of natural killer-1+ natural T cells that express alpha beta T
cell receptors requires a conserved beta 2-microglobulin-associated molecule,
presumably CD1d, displayed by CD4+8+ thymocytes. Here we demonstrate that
positive selection of natural T cells occurs independent of transporters
associated with antigen presentation-1 (TAP-1) function. Moreover, natural T
cells in TAP-1o/o mice are numerically expanded. Several H-2 class Ib molecules
function in a TAP-independent manner, suggesting that if expressed in TAP-1o/o
thymocytes, they could play a role in natural T cell development. Of these class 
Ib molecules, H-2TL is expressed by TAP-1o/o thymocytes. Moreover, we find that
thymi of TL+ mice congenic or transgenic for H-2T18 also have a numerically
expanded natural T cell repertoire compared with TL- mice. This expansion, as in 
TAP-1o/o thymi, is evident in each of the limited T cell receptor V beta chains
expressed by natural T cells, suggesting that TL and CD1d impact similar
repertoires. Thus TL, in addition to CD1d, plays a role in natural T cell
development.
