It was reported over a decade previously that CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T
(NKT) cells could interact with CD1d-expressing B cells and facilitate antibody
secretion. Since then, several studies have observed that NKT cells can provide
B-cell help for production of antibody against model and pathogen-derived
glycolipids, carbohydrates and proteins. In regard to T cell-dependent protein
antigens, it is still not entirely clear to what extent cognate interactions
between CD1d-expressing B cells and NKT cells contribute to initial and
long-lived B-cell responses that are characteristic of such antigens. In this
editorial, we review evidence that NKT cells provide CD1d-dependent cognate and
non-cognate forms of B-cell help following immunization with protein antigen.
Elucidating these mechanisms will be important for harnessing NKT cells during
vaccination.
