Purpose: Wound-healing dipyridamole- and papaverine-based aerosols (D1/D2) as
activators of the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate are promising
drugs that can accelerate wound healing in wound processes of various origins.
Methods: 128 rats were used in the study, including 38 in a pharmacological
experiment on a model of stencil wounds and 90 in an experiment that studied the 
effect of spray on the number of CD34 cells in the blood of rats with chemically 
induced immunodeficiency. Immunodeficiency was caused by the fivefold
administration of cyclophosphamide and prednisone. The expression level of CD34
was determined using flow cytofluorimeter. Results: Dipyridamole- and
papaverine-based aerosols of two compositions (with and without ascorbic acid)
have pronounced reparative properties, significantly accelerating
epithelialization and healing of stencil wounds in rats. In terms of this type of
action, they are somewhat superior to dexpanthenol. Dipyridamole- and
papaverine-based aerosols have the ability to produce beneficial effect on the
entire body's immune system by stimulating the division of pluripotent CD34
cells. The combined effect of papaverine and dipyridamole on tissues leads to
selective stimulation of the division of pluripotent cells in the wound, and
contributes to a six-fold acceleration of restoration of the animal's immune
system after induced immunodeficiency. Conclusion: Topical application of D1/D2
aerosol samples on the skin of rats contributed to a statistically significant
acceleration of regeneration processes. In terms of the appearance of
granulations and epithelialization of wounds, D1/D2 aerosols were superior to
dexpanthenol ointment.
