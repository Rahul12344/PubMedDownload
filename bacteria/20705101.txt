CFP21 is a major secreted protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) which is
considered as a promising antigen for immunotherapy. To identify CFP21-derived
HLA-A*0201 restricted epitopes, a series of native peptides and their analogues
were predicted with prediction programs and synthesized. The native peptide, p134
(AVADHVAAV), and its analogues, p134-1Y2L and p134-1Y2L9L, showed potent binding 
affinity and stability to HLA-A*0201 molecule. In ELISPOT assay, the cytotoxic T 
lymphocytes (CTLs) induced by these peptides could release IFN-γ. In cytotoxicity
assay, the CTLs induced by p134 and p134-1Y2L9L could specifically lyse
peptide-loaded T2 cells. In these two assays, the native peptide, p134, showed
the most potent activity. Our results indicated that p134 could be a novel
epitope which could serve as a good candidate to develop peptide vaccines against
M. tuberculosis.
