OBJECTIVES: Metals have different effects on the immune functions. Through the
experimental in vitro model, we studied the changes in the activation and
co-stimulatory surface markers in human lymphocytes cultivated with selected
metal salts.
METHODS: Whole human blood was cultivated with cadmium (Cd) or zinc (Zn) sulfate 
for 18 hours. The number of lymphocytes positive for activation and
co-stimulatory markers was evaluated by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: Elevation of the CD69 and CD23 markers as well as higher expression of
CD28 was found in cultures of lymphocytes incubated with Cd. In cultures
incubated with Zn, minor elevation of the HLA-DR antigen expression was observed 
in comparison to Cd-treated cell cultures. Decrease of CD3 expression was
observed after cultivation with both Cd and Zn salts.
CONCLUSION: Cd and Zn exhibit different effects on the expression of human
surface activation antigens and co-stimulatory molecules. Cd in non-toxic
concentrations stimulated expression of early activation molecules and therefore 
could change the early phase of immune response. This was not the case for Zn,
where the results were similar to untreated cell cultures.
