Osteoclast Inhibitory Lectin-related Protein 2 (OCILRP2) is a typical type II
transmembrane protein and belongs to C-type lectin-related protein family. It is 
preferentially expressed in dendritic cells (DC), B lymphocytes, and activated T 
lymphocytes. Upon binding to its ligand, OCILRP2 can promote CD28-mediated
co-stimulation and enhance T cell activation. However, the role of OCILRP2 in DC 
development and activation is unclear. In this report, we present evidence that
recombinant protein OCILRP2-Fc inhibits the generation and LPS-induced maturation
of murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) by downregulating the
expression of CD11c, MHC-II, and co-stimulators CD80 and CD86. OCILRP2-Fc also
reduces the capacity of BMDCs to take up antigens, activates T cells, and secret 
inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. Additionally, we show that
OCILRP2-Fc may cause the aforementioned effects through inhibiting NF-κB
activation. Therefore, OCILRP2 is a new regulator of DC maturation and
differentiation following TLR4 activation.
