Sphingomonads are isolated at exceptionally high frequency from organic polluted 
environments and assumed to be more hydrophobic than other Gram-negative
bacteria. However, the potential roles of cell-surface hydrophobicity (CSH) in
the cell survival in polluted environment, as well as the mechanisms underlying
the CSH of sphingomonads, remain unclear. Sphingobium hydrophobicum C1T is a
highly hydrophobic sphingomonad isolated from electronic-waste contaminated
sediment. In this study, we found that exposure to the typical pollutants in
electronic-waste contaminated sediment, such as the heavy metal ion Pb and the
organic compound deca-brominated diphenyl ether (deca-BDE), resulted in the
development of even higher CSH of the hydrophobic strain C1T; but no significant 
change was observed in the low CSH of its hydrophilic variant C2. The hydrophobic
strain C1T achieved higher biomass yield in standing conditions and adsorbed more
amounts of hydrophobic deca-BDE than its hydrophilic variant C2, suggesting that 
the high CSH potentially enhanced the adaptation of hydrophobic strain to
colonize in sediment and adsorb hydrophobic nutrients. The identification of the 
bacterial cell-surface constituents showed that the high CSH of S. hydrophobicum 
was contributed greatly by outer-membrane proteins, particularly membrane
transporters functioning as enhancers for nutrient uptake and stress sustainment.
This study will enhance our understanding of the adaptive strategies of
sphingomonads in contaminated environments. It will be of great importance to
enhance the CSH of sphingomonads and utilize them in cleaning up the environment 
from organic pollution.
