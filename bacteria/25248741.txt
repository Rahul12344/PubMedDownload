Lyme disease is the cause of a lot of anxiety and discussion. Patients are
demanding more preventive actions to avoid tick bites, and earlier and better
diagnosis of Lyme disease. However, only a minority of people bitten by a tick go
on to develop Lyme disease. Although physician delay may lead to a late diagnosis
of disseminated Lyme disease, these patients are still treatable and even in bad 
cases, symptoms will subside within a few years. While we know that serious
complications of late disseminated Lyme, e.g. neuroborreliosis, are very rare,
there is still uncertainty about how often Lyme disease occurs, and how often the
diagnosis is delayed. The high prevalence of seropositive people in the
population suggests that many people clear the infection without any symptoms and
without any treatment. Some decades ago mononucleosis infectiosa also had a bad
reputation but this largely disappeared when it became clear that recovery is the
rule. Lyme disease may also shed its reputation once the facts are known.
