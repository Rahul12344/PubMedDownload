INTRODUCTION: ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with
thrombospondin type 1 repeat motif. 13) is the major metalloprotease for VWF
degradation. ADAMTS13 deficiency causes the accumulation of uncleaved VWF and
might lead to a lethal thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is considered as a reductase of VWF (von Willebrand
factor) which can mildly downregulate the size of VWF by targeting on disulfide
bond between VWF dimers. It was reported that TSP1 might protected VWF from
cleaving by ADAMTS13, yet the underlying mechanism of this VWF protection has
remained unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Full-length ADAMTS13 and different domains (A1,A2,A3) of
human VWF were constructed and expressed respectively. The binding ability of
TSP1 or ADAMTS13 with each VWF domain or full-length VWF was investigated by
using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The inhibition of ADAMTS13 activities by
the different concentrations of TSP1 were observed by western blot and
residual-collagen binding assay (R-CBA) under the denaturing condition.
RESULTS: We found that ADAMTS13 interacted with the rVWF A1, A2, A3 domains and
full-length VWF, while TSP1 also bound to three A domains, especially to A2 and
A3 domains. We observed that TSP1 partially blocked ADAMTS13 binding to A2
domain, A3 domain and full length VWF. The results of our assays showed that TSP1
could restrain ADAMTS13 activity up to 70%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that TSP1 played competitively inhibitory role
in ADAMTS13 binding and cleaving of VWF, and the potential competition might
happen within A2 and A3 domains.
