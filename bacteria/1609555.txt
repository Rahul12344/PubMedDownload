This study concerns with the occurrence of aeromonads, coliforms and colony
counts in a drinking water supply. Aeromonas contents were detected in the range 
of 15.0 to greater than 2,400/100 ml in the raw water samples of the man made
lake. After the drinking water treatment process including fast sand filtration
and chlorination aeromonads indicated in comparison to total coliforms and colony
counts early and significant an after-growth of maximal 240 aeromonads/100 ml in 
the peripheric drinking water supply. Drinking water samples characterized by a
higher water temperature resulted in the highest contents of aeromonads. The
Aeromonas-Species Aeromonas sobria and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated most
frequently with 56.9 and 37.4 percent, respectively. The role of aeromonads as an
indicator of after-growth in drinking water supplies is discussed.
