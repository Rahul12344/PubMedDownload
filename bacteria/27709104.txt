Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) has been demonstrated to be of importance in
Staphylococcus aureus related diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD).
Dysregulated apoptosis in AD is remarkable, and SEB can induce apoptosis of
various cell types. However, the mechanisms by which SEB induces apoptosis and
influences disease processes remain unclear. In this study, the recombinant
SEB-induced THP-1 monocyte apoptosis was demonstrated in the absence of
preliminary cell activation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. SEB could
up-regulate the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in THP-1 cells
and induce apoptosis via an extrinsic pathway. TNFα could in turn increase the
expression of HLA-DRa, the SEB receptor on the cell surface. As a result, a
positive feedback cycle of TNFα was established. TNFα expression and SEB-induced 
apoptosis were decreased by knocking down the expression of either HLA-DRa or
TNFR1. Therefore, the feedback cycle of TNFα is crucial for SEB functions. This
work provides insights into the mechanisms of SEB-induced monocyte apoptosis and 
emphasizes the major role of TNFα in future related studies.
