Multiple myeloma is a life-threatening hematological malignancy, which is rarely 
curable by conventional therapies. Immunotherapy, using tumor antigen-specific,
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, may represent an alternative or additional treatment for
multiple myeloma. In this study, we used hybrid cell lines, generated by fusion
of an EBV B-lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) and myeloma cells, to stimulate in
vitro peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from patients with multiple myeloma. We
investigated induction of antigen-specific, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to the
well-defined tumor associated antigens (TAAs) hTERT, MUC1, MAGE-C1 and CS1, which
have been shown to be expressed in a high proportion of cases of multiple
myeloma. HLA-A2-peptide pentamer staining, interferon-Î³ and perforin ELISpot
assays, as well as cytotoxicity assays were used. Following several rounds of in 
vitro stimulation, the hybrid cell lines induced antigen-specific, cytotoxic
T-lymphocytes to four candidate TAAs in PBLs from HLA-A2+ multiple myeloma
patients, using known HLA-A2 restricted peptide epitopes of the TAAs. In
contrast, the HLA-A2+ myeloma cell line U266 failed to induce antigen-specific,
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in vitro. Our data indicate that B-LCL/myeloma hybrid
cell lines induce antigen-specific, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in PBLs isolated from
multiple myeloma patients in vitro and may represent a novel strategy for use in 
adoptive immunotherapy of multiple myeloma.
