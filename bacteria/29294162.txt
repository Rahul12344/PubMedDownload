BACKGROUND: In response to the global increase in antibiotic resistance, the
concept of antibiotic stewardship (ABS) has become increasingly important in
recent years. Several publications have demonstrated the effectiveness of ABS,
mainly in university facilities. This retrospective observational study describes
the implementation of ABS in a basic care hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Following existing national guidelines, an ABS team was set
up and measures were launched. These included: hospital guidelines, teaching,
weekly antibiotic ward rounds and the restriction of definite substances. The
preinterventional/postinterventional data analysis compared the use of
antibiotics and blood culture sets as well as the development of resistance,
infection with Clostridium difficile (CDI), costs, mortality and length of
hospital stay.
RESULTS: The measures introduced led to a significant and continuous decline in
total antibiotic use of initially 43 recommended daily doses (RDD)/100 patient
days (PD) to 31 RDD/100 PD (p < 0.001). The largest decrease was observed in
second generation (2G) cephalosporins (-67.5%), followed by 3G cephalosporins
(-52.7%), carbapenems (-42.0%) and quinolones (-38.5%). The resistance rate of
E. coli to 3G cephalosporins in blood cultures decreased from 26% to 9% (p =
0.021). The rate of blood cultures taken increased from 1.8 sets/100 PD to
3.2 sets/100 PD (+77%, p < 0.001). The pathogen detection rate, defined as one
count when a minimum of one sample taken in a day is positive, also increased
significantly from 4.0/1000 PD to 6.8/1000 PD (p < 0.001). The ABS had no effect 
on the overall mortality, the mean dwell time, and the preintervention low CDI
incidence.
CONCLUSION: The preinterventional/postinterventional comparison showed
a significant reduction in the overall consumption of antibiotics with
a redistribution in favor of antibiotics with a lower resistance selection. At
the same time, the resistance rate of E. coli decreased. The increase of the
blood culture rate indicates the optimization of diagnostic procedures. This ABS 
program had to be established with reduced resources but this seems to have been 
compensated by the more personal contact addressing the care takers and short
chain of commands, as is possible in smaller hospitals. Presumably, the structure
of basic care hospitals is particularly suitable for concepts covering entire
hospitals. Further clusters of randomized studies are necessary to confirm this.
