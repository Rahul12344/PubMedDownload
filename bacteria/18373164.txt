BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported that expression of monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and its receptor (CCR2) and CD40 ligation on
mesenchymal cells play important roles in tumor development. Cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2) has also been shown to contribute to tumor angiogenesis. We examined the 
interaction between MCP-1 and CD40 ligation in mesenchymal cells in gastric
cancer to determine the effect of these factors on vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) production via upregulation of COX-2 expression.
METHODS: COX-2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and VEGF production were evaluated in
CD40 ligand (CD40L)-stimulated macrophages. CD40L and MCP-1 mRNA levels in
gastric cancer tissues were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Localizations of MCP-1, CD40L, CD34, CD40, and CCR2 in 34 gastric cancer
tissue specimens were evaluated by single-or double-label immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: COX-2 expression levels were significantly higher in CD40L-stimulated
macrophages and correlated with increased PGE2 and VEGF production. Addition of
MCP-1 to CD40L-stimulated macrophages had a synergistic effect on COX-2
expression and subsequent PGE2 and VEGF production. CD40L and MCP-1 mRNA levels
were significantly higher in poorly differentiated gastric cancers than in H.
pylori-infected gastritis patients. High microvessel density was significantly
associated with MCP-1 and CCR2 scores and lymph node metastasis.
CONCLUSIONS: MCP-1 and CD40L had a synergistic effect on COX-2 expression and
subsequent VEGF production in gastric cancer.
