The inner membrane ring of the bacterial type III secretion system (TTSS) is
composed of two proteins. In Chlamydia trachomatis this ring is formed by CdsD
(gene name CT_664) and CdsJ (gene name CTA_0609). CdsD consists of 829 amino
acids. The last 400 amino acids at its C-terminal end relate it to the type III
secretion system YscD/HrpQ protein family. The C-terminal domain, consisting of
amino acids 558-771, of C. trachomatis CdsD was overexpressed in Escherichia coli
and purified using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) and
size-exclusion chromatography. The protein was crystallized using the
vapour-diffusion method. A data set was collected to 2.26 Å resolution. The
crystals have the symmetry of space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
106.60, b = 23.91, c = 118.65 Å, β = 104.95°. According to the data analysis
there is expected to be one molecule in the asymmetric unit, with a Matthews
coefficient of 3.0 Å(3) Da(-1).
