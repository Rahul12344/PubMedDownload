BACKGROUND: Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) have been widely studied as
bactericidal reagents. However, it is still challenging to use ZnONPs as a root
canal sealant to eliminate infecting microorganisms in the root canal system.
This study aimed at understanding the antibacterial and biofilm effects of ZnONPs
in the infected root canal and their effect on cell function.
METHODS: This study aimed to develop a better understanding of the antibacterial 
effects of ZnONPs in the infected root canal and their effect on cell function.
Experiments were performed in two stages; the first stage included inhibition
zone tests and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test, which were
performed to examine the antibacterial activity of ZnONPs against Porphyromonas
gingivalis (P. gingivalis) and Actinomyces Naeslundii (A. naeslundii) bacteria in
vitro. ZnONPs were further evaluated for their biocompatibility using normal
mouse NIH3T3 and OCCM-30 cells by the cell-based MTT assay. In addition, the
influence of ZnONPs on matrix metalloproteinases in NIH3T3 cells and their
inhibiting factors (Mmp13 and Timp1) were measured using the real-time PCR
technique and western blot method.
RESULTS: The MIC of ZnONPs against P. gingivalis and A. naeslundii were confirmed
to be 10 μg/mL and 40 μg/mL, respectively. The MTT assay showed that ZnONPs were 
nontoxic. The RT-PCR and western blotting results showed that Mmp13 was
downregulated and Timp1 expression was increased. Meanwhile, ZnONPs were shown to
increase the expression of the OCCM-30 osteogenesis-related factors Bsp and
Runx2. Finally, there was no significant change in the morphology of NIH3T3 and
OCCM-30 cells after the addition of different concentrations of ZnONPs for
different periods of time.
CONCLUSION: ZnONPs have excellent antibacterial activity against P. gingivalis
and A. naeslundii and have low cell cytotoxicity in vitro.
