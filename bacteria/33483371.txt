CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) mediate strong
anti-tumor immunity when stimulated by glycolipid agonists. However, attempts to 
develop effective iNKT cell agonists for clinical applications have been thwarted
by potential problems with dose-limiting toxicity and by activation-induced iNKT 
cell anergy, which limits the efficacy of repeated administration. To overcome
these issues, we developed a unique bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) based on
covalent conjugates of soluble CD1d with photoreactive analogs of the glycolipid 
α-galactosylceramide. Here we characterize the in vivo activities of iNKT
cell-specific BiTEs and assess their efficacy for cancer immunotherapy in mouse
models using transplantable colorectal cancer or melanoma tumor lines engineered 
to express human Her2 as a tumor-associated antigen. Systemic administration of
conjugated BiTEs stimulated multiple iNKT cell effector functions including
cytokine release, secondary activation of NK cells, and induction of dendritic
cell maturation and also initiated epitope spreading for tumor-specific CD8+
cytolytic T cell responses. The anti-tumor effects of iNKT cell activation with
conjugated BiTEs were further enhanced by simultaneous checkpoint blockade with
antibodies to CTLA-4, providing a potential approach for combination
immunotherapy. Multiple injections of covalently stabilized iNKT cell-specific
BiTEs activated iNKT cells without causing iNKT anergy and exhaustion, thus
enabling repeated administration for effective and nontoxic cancer immunotherapy 
regimens.
