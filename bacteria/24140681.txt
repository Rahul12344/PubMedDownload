Biogas digesters are widely promoted and increasingly used to treat and generate 
gas from pig slurry worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe manure
management practices with focus on biogas digestion among small scale pig farmers
in Hue (50 farmers) and Hanoi (96 farmers) and to assess fecal contamination
levels in biogas effluent. Results showed that 84% of the farmers in Hanoi and
42% in Hue used both pig slurry and human excreta for biogas production. Biogas
digestion only reduced E. coli concentrations by 1 to 2 log units to 3.70 ± 0.84 
Escherichia coli (log10) cfu/ml on average in effluent as compared with raw
slurry. Biogas effluent was commonly used to fertilize vegetables or discharged
directly into the garden or aquatic recipients. Reduced problems with bad smells 
and flies were reported as main reasons for establishing a biogas digester.
Further studies are needed to assess human and animal health hazards associated
with the discharge and use of biogas effluent from small-scale biogas systems.
