BACKGROUND: Intestinal homeostasis plays an important role in bacteria-derived
complications in cirrhosis. Intestinal lymphocytes are responsible for immune
effector functions and can be modulated by certain probiotics. We evaluate the
interaction between Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 and intestinal
lymphocytes in mice with cirrhosis.
ANIMALS AND METHODS: Cirrhosis was induced by intragastrical administration of
carbon tetrachloride in Balb/C mice. One week prior to laparotomy, animals
received B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 (10(7), 10(9) or 10(10) cfu/daily) or
placebo. Chemokine receptor and cytokine expression were evaluated in intestinal 
lymphocytes. Gut permeability was studied by FITC-LPS recovery in vivo. Luminal
antigens, inflammation and functional markers were evaluated in liver samples.
RESULTS: Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 decreased the expression of
pro-inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR6, CCR9, CXCR3 and CXCR6 in intestinal
lymphocytes from cirrhotic mice in a concentration-dependent manner. The
bifidobacterial strain induced a shift towards an anti-inflammatory cytokine
profile in this cell subset. B. pseudocatenulatum CECT7765-induced inflammatory
modulation was TLR2-mediated, as in vitro TLR2 blockade inhibited the reduction
of TNF-alpha and its receptors and the increase of IL-10 and IL-10 receptor
secretion. The recovery rate of administered fluorescence-labelled endotoxin was 
significantly and dose-dependently lowered with the bifidobacterial strain. The
reduced intestinal permeability was associated with a decreased burden of
bacterial antigens in the liver of mice treated with B. pseudocatenulatum
CECT7765. Liver function and inflammation were improved with the use of the
bifidobacterial strain at the highest dose tested (10(10) cfu).
CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum CECT7765 improves gut homeostasis
and prevents gut-derived complications in experimental chronic liver disease.
