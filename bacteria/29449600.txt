Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent anti-inflammatory drugs whose mode of action is 
complex and still debatable. One likely cellular target of GCs are
monocytes/macrophages. The role of GCs in monocyte survival is also debated.
Although both granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and
macrophage-CSF (M-CSF) are important regulators of macrophage lineage functions
including their survival, the former is often associated with proinflammatory
functions while the latter is important in lineage homeostasis. We report here
that the GC, dexamethasone, induces apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated human monocytes
while having no impact on M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. To understand how GCs,
GM-CSF, and M-CSF are regulating monocyte survival and other functions during
inflammation, we firstly examined the transcriptomic changes elicited by these
three agents in human monocytes, either acting alone or in combination.
Transcriptomic and Ingenuity pathway analyses found that dexamethasone
differentially modulated dendritic cell maturation and TREM1 signaling pathways
in GM-CSF-treated and M-CSF-treated monocytes, two pathways known to be regulated
by ERK1/2 activity. These analyses led us to provide evidence that the GC
inhibits ERK1/2 activity selectively in GM-CSF-treated monocytes to induce
apoptosis. It is proposed that this inhibition of ERK1/2 activity leads to
inactivation of p90 ribosomal-S6 kinase and Bad dephosphorylation leading in turn
to enhanced caspase-3 activity and subsequent apoptosis. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition of GC receptor activity restored the ERK1/2 signaling 
and prevented the GC-induced apoptosis in GM-CSF-treated monocytes. Increased
tissue macrophage numbers, possibly from enhanced survival due to mediators such 
as GM-CSF, can correlate with inflammatory disease severity; also reduction in
these numbers can correlate with the therapeutic benefit of a number of agents,
including GCs. We propose that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway promotes survival of 
GM-CSF-treated proinflammatory monocytes, which can be selectively targeted by
GCs as a novel mechanism to reduce local monocyte/macrophage numbers and hence
inflammation.
