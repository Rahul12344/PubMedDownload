BACKGROUND: Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are common causative agents 
of respiratory tract infection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the
gram-negative cell wall and a strong inducer of inflammation. The main
proinflammatory component of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall is
lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The protein kinase p38 mitogen activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) plays an important role in the inflammatory process induced by these two
bacterial structures.
AIM: We here sought to establish the impact of local p38 MAPK inhibition on lung 
inflammatory responses induced by LPS and LTA. We investigated the effects of
direct intrapulmonary delivery of a p38 MAPK inhibitor on local LPS and LTA
induced airway inflammation in mice.
RESULTS: In vitro, BIRB 796 reduced LPS induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation in
alveolar macrophage and respiratory epithelial cell lines and diminished
cytokine/chemokine release. In vivo, BIRB 796 circumvented p38 MAPK
phosphorylation in both LPS and LTA induced inflammation. Cellular influx was not
affected. Lung TNFα, IL-6, MIP-2 and LIX production was reduced in LPS induced
inflammation but not in lung inflammation by LTA. BIRB 796 reduced total protein 
and IgM in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after LTA instillation, while enhancing
TATc and d-dimers in LPS- and LTA induced inflammation.
CONCLUSION: These results taken together with earlier studies on systemic
administration of p38 MAPK inhibitors in rodents and humans suggest that direct
intrapulmonary delivery of a p38 MAPK inhibitor is less effective in inhibiting
inflammation and is associated with unexpected procoagulant effects in the
bronchoalveolar space.
