Water samples from Ganga river were collected from 3 different locations viz.
Kachla, Fatehgarh and Kannauj (U.P.). High performance liquid chromatography
analysis of samples by liquid-liquid extraction procedure showed the presence of 
some pesticides like DDT, alpha-BHC, aldrin, dieldrin etc. DDT, alpha-BHC, DDD,
aldrin and dieldrin were present at concentration ranges of 3.33-5.33 ppb,
1.73-3.01 ppb, 0.88-2.41 ppb, 1.17-2.81 ppb and 0.49-4.11 ppb, respectively. The 
organophosphorus pesticides like dimethoate and methyl parathion were also
detected at the concentration levels of 0.41-0.56 ppb and 0.16-0.50 ppb,
respectively. The organic substances in the test samples were extracted by
XAD-resin and liquid-liquid extraction procedures, and the extracts were assayed 
for mutagenic potential by the Ames Salmonella/microsome test. The test samples
exhibited a remarkable degree of mutagenicity with TA98, TA100 and TA97a strains 
with the probable role of contaminating pesticides in the river water.
