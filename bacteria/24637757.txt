A UDP-glucose:tetrahydrobiopterin α-glucosyltransferase (BGluT) enzyme was
discovered in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 which transfers a
glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). BGluT protein was
overexpressed with selenomethionine labelling for structure determination by the 
multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion method. The BGluT protein was purified by
nickel-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. It was then crystallized by
the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using a well solution consisting of 0.1 
M bis-tris pH 5.5, 19%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350 with 4%(w/v) D(+)-galactose 
as an additive. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.99 Å resolution using 
a synchrotron-radiation source. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space
group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 171.35, b = 77.99, c = 53.77 Å, β =
90.27°.
