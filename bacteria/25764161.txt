The aim of this research was to determine the levels of human leukocyte antigen G
(HLA-G) and endometrial Natural Killer ((e)NK) cell percentages in uterine
flushing samples from primary and secondary infertile women. sHLA-G levels were
lower in the uterine flushing samples from primary infertile women in comparison 
with women with secondary infertility. Lower CD56+KIR2DL4+ (e)NK cell percentages
were detected in primary infertile women compared with secondary infertile women.
This is the first study demonstrating that primary and secondary unexplained
infertilities are characterized by different basal sHLA-G levels and
CD56+KIR2DL4+ (e)NK cell percentages.
