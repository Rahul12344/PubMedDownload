BACKGROUND: Hand washbasin U-bends have increasingly been associated with
nosocomial outbreaks by Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
which is virtually ubiquitous in U-bends. Wastewater networks servicing U-bends
are potential highways for trafficking pathogenic bacteria.
AIM: To use P. aeruginosa to investigate trafficking of bacteria between hospital
washbasin U-bends.
METHODS: Twenty-five washbasin U-bends in five locations in Dublin Dental
University Hospital (DDUH) were investigated for trafficking of P. aeruginosa: 10
in Clinic 2 (C2), 10 in the Accident & Emergency Department (A&E) and five in
three other locations. In addition, washbasin tap samples (N=80) and mains and
tap water samples (N=72) were cultured for P. aeruginosa. Selected P. aeruginosa 
isolates recovered over 29 months underwent whole-genome sequencing, and
relatedness was interpreted using whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing and
pairwise single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis.
FINDINGS: P. aeruginosa was recovered from all U-bends but not from taps or
water. Eighty-three U-bend isolates yielded 10 sequence types (STs), with ST560
and ST179 from A&E, C2 and two other locations predominating (70%). ST560 was
also recovered from a common downstream pipe. Isolates within ST560 and ST179
were highly related regardless of source. ST560 was divided into Cluster I (N=25)
and Cluster II (N=2) with average allelic differences and SNPs of three and zero,
and two and five, respectively. The 31 ST179 isolates exhibited an average
allelic difference and SNPs of three and 12, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Highly related P. aeruginosa strains were identified in multiple
U-bends in several DDUH locations, indicating trafficking via the wastewater
network.
