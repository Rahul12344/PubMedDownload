The present study aimed to develop a consortium of nutritive fermented food
products, supplemented with phytochemicals, with reduced toxicological contents. 
We developed new flavored Doenjang products (protein rich) fermented with lotus, 
ginkgo, and garlic plant extract-based Meju (termed as EMD) as the starter
culture and by using traditional Meju (termed as TMD), where these plant extracts
were added later during the fermentation process. Fermented Doenjang samples were
analyzed for reduced levels of biogenic amines (BAs), aflatoxins, and microbial
hazards, (including Bacillus cereus) as well as for their nutritive contents and 
antioxidant potential, after varying periods of fermentation (0, 3, 6, 9 and 12
months). All Doenjang samples prepared using plant extracts and their mixtures
(1% and 10%) showed desired reduction in B. cereus counts, BAs, aflatoxins, and
other foodborne pathogens as well as showed potent antioxidant abilities,
including phenolic/flavonoid contents. Based on the higher efficiency in reducing
various toxicants, Ginkgo biloba leaf extract added TMD samples were selected for
the development of Doenjang products as an innovative approach, with great
potential to improve the quality and safety of soybean fermented products in the 
Korean market, offering enhanced health benefits and reduced risks of toxicity.
