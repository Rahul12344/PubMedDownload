The proliferation of glomerular mesangial cells (GMC) and secretion of the
extracellular matrix (ECM) in rat with Thy-1 nephritis (Thy-1N) resembling human 
mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis have been explored for many years;
however, the molecular mechanisms of GMC proliferation and ECM production remain 
unclear. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)
gene was involved in mediating rat GMC proliferation and ECM synthesis induced by
sublytic C5b-9 in vitro. In the present study, the roles of the TSP-1 gene in GMC
proliferation, ECM production, and urinary protein secretion in Thy-1N rats were 
determined by using TSP-1 small hairpin RNA, and the results revealed that
silencing of the TSP-1 gene in rat renal tissues could diminish GMC proliferation
(P < 0.01) and ECM secretion (P < 0.01) as well as urinary protein secretion (P <
0.05) in Thy-1N rats. Together, the current findings suggested that TSP-1 gene
expression was required for GMC proliferation and ECM production in Thy-1N rats.
