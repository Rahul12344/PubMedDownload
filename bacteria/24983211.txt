Alpha-synuclein (αS) misfolding is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) but
little is known about the mechanisms underlying αS toxicity. Increasing evidence 
suggests that defects in membrane transport play an important role in neuronal
dysfunction. Here we demonstrate that the GTPase Rab8a interacts with αS in
rodent brain. NMR spectroscopy reveals that the C-terminus of αS binds to the
functionally important switch region as well as the C-terminal tail of Rab8a. In 
line with a direct Rab8a/αS interaction, Rab8a enhanced αS aggregation and
reduced αS-induced cellular toxicity. In addition, Rab8 - the Drosophila ortholog
of Rab8a - ameliorated αS-oligomer specific locomotor impairment and neuron loss 
in fruit flies. In support of the pathogenic relevance of the αS-Rab8a
interaction, phosphorylation of αS at S129 enhanced binding to Rab8a, increased
formation of insoluble αS aggregates and reduced cellular toxicity. Our study
provides novel mechanistic insights into the interplay of the GTPase Rab8a and αS
cytotoxicity, and underscores the therapeutic potential of targeting this
interaction.
