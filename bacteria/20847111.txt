PURPOSE: CD36 is a Class B scavenger receptor that is constitutively expressed in
the corneal epithelium and has been implicated in many homeostatic functions,
including the homeostasis of the epidermal barrier. The aim of this study is to
determine (1) whether CD36 is required for the maintenance of the corneal
epithelial barrier to infection, and (2) whether CD36-deficient mice present with
an increased susceptibility to bacterial keratitis.
METHODS: The corneas of CD36(-/-), TSP1(-/-), TLR2(-/-), and C57BL/6 WT mice were
screened via slit lamp microscopy or ex vivo analysis. The epithelial tight
junctions and mucin layer were assessed via LC-biotin and Rose Bengal staining,
respectively. Bacterial quantification was performed on corneal buttons and
GFP-expressing Staphylococcus aureus was used to study bacterial binding.
RESULTS: CD36(-/-) mice develop spontaneous corneal defects that increased in
frequency and severity with age. The mild corneal defects were characterized by a
disruption in epithelial tight junctions and the mucin layer, an infiltrate of
macrophages, and increased bacterial binding. Bacterial quantification revealed
high levels of Staphylococcus xylosus in the corneas of CD36(-/-) mice with
severe defects, but not in wild-type controls.
CONCLUSIONS: CD36(-/-) mice develop spontaneous bacterial keratitis independent
of TLR2 and TSP1. The authors conclude that CD36 is a critical component of the
corneal epithelial barrier, and in the absence of CD36 the barrier breaks down,
allowing bacteria to bind to the corneal epithelium and resulting in spontaneous 
keratitis. This is the first report of spontaneous bacterial keratitis in mice.
