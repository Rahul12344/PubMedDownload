The causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium, replicates inside a membrane-bound
parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which shields this intracellular parasite from the 
cytosol of the host cell 1 . One common threat for intracellular pathogens is the
homeostatic process of autophagy, through which cells capture unwanted
intracellular material for lysosomal degradation 2 . During the liver stage of a 
malaria infection, Plasmodium parasites are targeted by the autophagy machinery
of the host cell, and the PV membrane (PVM) becomes decorated with several
autophagy markers, including LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3)
3,4 . Here we show that Plasmodium berghei parasites infecting hepatic cells rely
on the PVM transmembrane protein UIS3 to avoid elimination by host-cell-mediated 
autophagy. We found that UIS3 binds host LC3 through a non-canonical interaction 
with a specialized surface on LC3 where host proteins with essential functions
during autophagy also bind. UIS3 acts as a bona fide autophagy inhibitor by
competing with host LC3-interacting proteins for LC3 binding. Our work identifies
UIS3, one of the most promising candidates for a genetically attenuated vaccine
against malaria 5 , as a unique and potent mediator of autophagy evasion in
Plasmodium. We propose that the protein-protein interaction between UIS3 and host
LC3 represents a target for antimalarial drug development.
