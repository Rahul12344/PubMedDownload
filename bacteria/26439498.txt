Paratuberculosis or Johne's disease is a chronic granulomatous enteropathy in
ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) infection. 
In the present study, we examined the host response to MAP infection in spleens
of mice in order to investigate the host immunopathology accompanying
host-pathogen interaction. Transcriptional profiles of the MAP-infected mice at 3
and 6 weeks p.i. showed severe histopathological changes, whereas those at 12
weeks p.i. displayed reduced lesion severity in the spleen and liver.
MAP-infected mice at 3 and 6 weeks p.i. showed up-regulation of
interferon-related genes, scavenger receptor, and complement components,
suggesting an initial innate immune reaction, such as macrophage activation,
bactericidal activity, and macrophage invasion of MAP. Concurrently, MAP-infected
mice at 3 and 6 weeks p.i. were also suggested to express M2 macrophage phenotype
with up-regulation of Mrc1, and Marco and down-regulation of MHC class II, Ccr7, 
and Irf5, and canonical pathways related to the T cell response including
ICOS-ICOSL signaling in T helper cells, calcium-induced T lymphocyte apoptosis,
and CD28 signaling in T helper cell. These results provide information which
furthers the understanding of the immunopathologic response to MAP infection in
mice, thereby providing insights valuable for research into the pathogenesis for 
MAP infection.
