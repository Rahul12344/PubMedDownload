Visualizing tissue distribution of steroid hormones is a promising application of
MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). On-tissue chemical derivatization using
Girard's T reagent has enhanced the ionization efficiency of steroids. However,
discriminating between structural isomers with distinct bioactivities remains a
challenge. Herein, we used ion trap MS/tandem MS (MS3) to distinguish a
mineralcorticoid aldosterone (Aldo) and a glucocorticoid cortisol (F), from their
structural isomers. Our method is also useful to detect hybrid steroids
(18-hydroxycortisol [18-OHF] and 18-oxocortisol) with sufficient signal-to-noise 
ratio. The clinical applicability of the tandem MS method was evaluated by
analyzing F, Aldo, and 18-OHF distributions in human adrenal glands. In such
clinical specimens, small Aldo-producing cell clusters (APCCs) were identified
and were first found to produce a high level of Aldo and not to contain F.
Moreover, a part of APCCs produced 18-OHF, presumably converted from F by
APCC-specific CYP11B2 activity. Catecholamine species were also visualized with
another derivatization reagent (TAHS), and those profiling successfully
discriminated pheochromocytoma species. These tandem MSI-methods, coupled with
on-tissue chemical derivatization has proven to be useful for detecting
low-abundance steroids, including Aldo and hybrid steroids and thus identifying
steroid hormone-producing lesions.
