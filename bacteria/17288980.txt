Dynamic modification of proteins with the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)
affects the stability, cellular localization, enzymatic activity, and molecular
interactions of a wide spectrum of protein targets. We have developed an in vitro
fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer-based assay that uses bacterially
expressed substrates for the rapid and quantitative analysis of SUMO
paralog-specific C-terminal hydrolase activity. This assay has applications in
SUMO protease characterization, enzyme kinetic analysis, determination of SUMO
protease activity in eukaryotic cell extracts, and high-throughput inhibitor
screening. In addition, while demonstrating such uses, we show that the SUMO-1
processing activity in crude HeLa cell extracts is far greater than that of
SUMO-2, implying that differential maturation rates of SUMO paralogs in vivo may 
be functionally significant. The high degree of structural conservation across
the ubiquitin-like protein superfamily suggests that the general principle of
this assay should be applicable to other post-translational protein modification 
systems.
