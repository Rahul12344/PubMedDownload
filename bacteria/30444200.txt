INTRODUCTION: Recent studies on CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR)-modified T cells (CARTs) have demonstrated unprecedented successes in
treating refractory and relapsed B cell malignancies. The key to the latest CART 
therapy advances can be attributed to the improved costimulatory signals in the
CAR design.
METHODS: Here, we established several novel CARs by incorporating T cell
signaling domains of CD28 in conjunction with intracellular signaling motif of
4-1BB, CD27, OX40, ICOS, and IL-15Rα. These novel CARs were functionally assessed
based on a simple target cell killing assay.
RESULTS: The results showed that the CD28/IL-15Rα co-signaling (153z) CAR
demonstrated the fastest T cell expansion potential and cytotoxic activities.
IL-15 is a key cytokine that mediates immune effector activities. The 153z CARTs 
maintained prolonged killing activities after repetitive rounds of target cell
engagement. Consistent with the enhanced target killing function, the 153z CARTs 
produced increased amount of effector cytokines including IFN-γ, TNFα and IL-2
upon interaction with the target cells.
CONCLUSION: In a follow-up clinical study, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 
patient, who experienced multiple relapses of central nervous system leukemia
(CNSL) and failed all conventional therapies, was enrolled to receive the
CD19-specific 153z CART treatment. The patient achieved complete remission after 
the 153z CART cell infusion. The translational outcome supports further
investigation into the safety and enhanced therapeutic efficacy of the
IL-15Rα-modified CART cells in cancer patients.
