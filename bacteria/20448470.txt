Prior to the introduction of killed whole cell pertussis vaccine [wP] in the
1940s, whooping cough was a major cause of infant death worldwide. Widespread
vaccination of children with this vaccine caused a significant reduction in
mortality. However in the 1990s and now more recently, there has been a
resurgence of pertussis in several countries even in populations previously
vaccinated with an acellular pertussis vaccine [aP]. In this review, we describe 
the epidemiology of whooping cough, the vast array of virulence factors produced 
by this pathogen potentially contributing to the resurgence of pertussis even in 
previously vaccinated populations of infants and children, history of whooping
cough prophylaxis, possible mechanisms of immunity, lack of availability of a
suitable non-toxic adjuvant capable of inducing both arms of the immune response,
and the current status of development of improved vaccines with potential to
induce longer-lasting protection, than is currently possible with the wP or aP
vaccines, against whooping cough.
