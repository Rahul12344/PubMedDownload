MHC class I tetramers containing peptide epitopes are sensitive tools for
detecting antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses. We demonstrate here that
binding of HLA-A2 tetramers to CD8(+) T cells specific for the
melanoma-associated antigen Melan-A/MART-1 can be fine-tuned by altering either
the bound peptide epitope or residues in the alpha 3 domain of HLA-A2, which is
important for CD8 binding. Antigen-specific T cells expressing high levels of CD8
could be detected using HLA-A2 tetramers containing the peptide AAGIGILTV, an
epitope which is naturally processed and presented from Melan-A/MART-1. In
contrast, low CD8-expressing, antigen-specific T cells could be detected
efficiently only by using a mutated HLA-A2 tetramer with an altered CD8 binding
site or, less efficiently, using the wild-type HLA-A2 tetramer loaded with the
peptide analogue ELAGIGILTV, which is superior in stimulating antigen-specific
T-cell responses. Our results suggest ways to optimize the identification and
expansion of antigen-specific T cells with different requirements for the
costimulatory CD8 molecule in facilitating T-cell receptor binding to peptide
variants.
