In previous studies of ionic liquid (IL) tolerance of numerous species of
ascomycetous yeasts, two strains of Wickerhamomyces ciferrii and Galactomyces
candidus had unusually high tolerance in media containing up to 5% (w/v) of the
1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2C1Im][OAc]). The study aimed at
investigating whether additional strains of these species, and additional species
in the Dipodascaceae family, also possess IL tolerance, and to compare
sensitivity to the acetate and chloride versions of the ionic liquid. Fifty five 
yeast strains in the family Dipodascaceae, which encompasses genera Galactomyces,
Geotrichum, and Dipodascus, and seven yeast strains of species Wickerhamomyces
ciferrii were tested for ability to grow in laboratory medium containing no IL,
242 mM [C2C1Im][OAc], or 242 mM [C2C1Im]Cl, and in IL-pretreated switchgrass
hydrolysate. Many yeasts exhibited tolerance of one or both ILs, with higher
tolerance of the chloride anion than of the acetate anion. Different strains of
the same species exhibited varying degrees of IL tolerance. Galactomyces
candidus, UCDFSTs 52-260, and 50-64, had exceptionally robust growth in
[C2C1Im][OAc], and also grew well in the switchgrass hydrolysate. Identification 
of IL tolerant and IL resistant yeast strains will facilitate studies of the
mechanism of IL tolerance, which could include superior efflux, metabolism or
exclusion.
