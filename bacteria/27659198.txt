BACKGROUND: To determine the distribution of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class 
I genotypes in a Ugandan population of persons with tuberculosis (TB) and
establish the relationship between class I HLA types and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB) disease.
METHODS: Blood samples were drawn from HIV negative individuals with active TB
and HIV negative household controls. DNA was extracted from blood samples and HLA
typed by the polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer method. The
allelic frequencies were determined by direct count.
RESULTS: HLA-A*02, B*15, C*07, C*03, B*58, C*04, A*01, A*74, C*02 and A*30 were
the dominant genotypes in this Ugandan cohort. There were differences in the
distribution of HLA types between the individuals with active TB and the
household controls with only HLA-A*03 allele showing a statistically significant 
difference (p = 0.017 crude; OR = 6.29 and p = 0.016; OR = 11.67 after adjustment
for age). However, after applying the Benjamini and Hochberg adjustment for
multiple comparisons the difference was no longer statistically significant
(p = 0.374 and p = 0.176 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a number of HLA class I alleles in a population from
Central Uganda which will enable us to carry out a functional characterization of
CD8+ T-cell mediated immune responses to MTB. Our results do not show a positive 
association between the HLA class I alleles and TB in this Ugandan population
however the study sample was too small to draw any firm conclusions about the
role of HLA class I alleles and TB development in Uganda.
