P(II) proteins signal the cellular nitrogen status in numerous bacteria, and in
cyanobacteria P(II) is subjected to serine phosphorylation when the cells
experience a high C to N balance. In the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus
sp. PCC 7942, the P(II) protein (glnB gene product) is known to mediate the
ammonium-dependent inhibition of nitrate and nitrite uptake. The analysis of gene
expression through RNA/DNA hybridization indicated that a P(II)-null mutant was
also impaired in the induction of NtcA-dependent, nitrogen assimilation genes
amt1 (ammonium permease), glnA (glutamine synthetase) and nir (nitrite
reductase), as well as of the N-control gene ntcA, mainly under nitrogen
deprivation. This gene expression phenotype of the glnB mutant could be
complemented by wild-type P(II) protein or by modified P(II) proteins that cannot
be phosphorylated and mimic either the phosphorylated (GlnB(S49D) and GlnB(S49E))
or unphosphorylated (GlnB(S49A)) form of P(II). However, strains carrying the
GlnB(S49D) and GlnB(S49E) mutant proteins exhibited higher levels of expression
of nitrogen-regulated genes than the strains carrying the wild-type P(II) or the 
GlnB(S49A) protein.
