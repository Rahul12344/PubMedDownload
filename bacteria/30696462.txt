BACKGROUND: Allograft rejection and infection are the major sources of morbidity 
and mortality after heart transplant. Early differential diagnosis is clinically 
crucial but difficult. The aim of the study was to examine serum cytokine
profiles associated with each entity and whether such profiles could help to
differentiate between them.
METHODS: Heart allografts from Wistar rats were transplanted to Lewis rats as
described by Yokoyama. Cardiac rejection and pulmonary bacterial infection were
induced by Cyclosporine cessation and bacteria bronchus injection, and
pathologically confirmed. Ninety serological cytokines profiles of the study
objects were then simultaneously measured using a biotin label-based cytokine
array. The fold change (FC) was used for relative cytokine concentration
comparison analysis.
RESULTS: Four cytokines in cardiac rejection group were significantly
dysregulated as compared to health controls (Î² -Catenin, 0.51 FC; E-Selectin,
0.62 FC; IFN-gamma, 1.87 FC; and IL-13, 0.60 FC, respectively). In pulmonary
infection animals, 11 cytokines were remarkably dysregulated in comparison with
the control group (CINC-3, 0.57 FC; CNTF R alpha, 0.59 FC; E-Selectin, 0.58 FC;
FSL1,0.62 FC; Hepassocin, 0.64 FC; IL-2, 0.26 FC; IL-13, 0.49 FC; NGFR, 0.57 FC; 
RAGE, 0.50 FC; TIMP-1, 0.49 FC; and IFN-gamma, 1.77 FC, respectively). Eleven
cytokines were significantly up-regulated in cardiac rejection group comparing to
the pulmonary infection animals (FSL1, 2.32FC; Fractalkine, 1.65FC; GFR alpha-1, 
1.64FC; IL-2, 2.72FC; IL-5, 1.60FC; MMP-2, 1.71FC; NGFR, 2.25FC; TGF-beta1,
1.58FC; TGF-beta3, 1.58FC; Thrombospondin, 1.64FC, and TIMP-1, 1.52FC,
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The current study illustrated the disease-specific serological
cytokine profiles of allograft rejection and pulmonary bacterial infection after 
cardiac transplant. Such disease associated cytokine portraits might have the
potential for early discrimination diagnosis.
