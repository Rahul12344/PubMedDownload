Costimulatory signals are required to achieve robust chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T cell expansion, function, persistence and antitumor activity. These can
be provided by incorporating intracellular signalling domains from one or more T 
cell costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 or 4-1BB, into the CAR. The selection 
and positioning of costimulatory domains within a CAR construct influence CAR T
cell function and fate, and clinical experience of autologous anti-CD19 CAR T
cell therapies suggests that costimulatory domains have differential impacts on
CAR T cell kinetics, cytotoxic function and potentially safety profile. The
clinical impacts of combining costimulatory domains and of alternative
costimulatory domains are not yet clearly established, and may be construct- and 
disease-specific. The aim of this review is to summarise the function and effect 
of established and emerging costimulatory domains and their combinations within
CAR T cells.
