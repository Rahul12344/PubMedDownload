Rifampicin monooxygenase (RIFMO) decreases the potency of rifampicin (RIF) by
converting it to oxidative products. Further decomposition of RIF has been
observed in bacteria producing RIFMO and contributes to RIFMO-mediated drug
resistance. Here we report the first crystal structure of RIFMO in complex with
the hydroxylated RIF product. The 2.10 Ã… resolution structure reveals a breach of
the ansa aliphatic chain of RIF between naphthoquinone C2 and amide N1. Our data 
suggest that RIFMO catalyzes the hydroxylation of RIF at the C2 atom followed by 
cleavage of the ansa linkage, which leads to inactivation of the antibiotic by
preventing key contacts with the RNA polymerase target.
