OBJECTIVES: To prospectively study the impact of the CapSure (Re/Stor) Continence
shield for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.
METHODS: One hundred women with pure stress urinary incontinence were enrolled in
a 6-month study. Objective measures of urine loss included pad weight test (PdWt)
and provocative stress test (PST). Subjective measures included incontinence
diaries documenting the number of incontinence episodes per day (IEPD), quality
of life questionnaires, and satisfaction surveys. Objective and subjective
measures were performed prior to enrollment, during use of the CapSure shield,
and after discontinuation of the device.
RESULTS: During the 12-week device utilization period, PdWt measurements
demonstrated a 96% reduction in urine loss by week 1 and 97% by week 12.
Eighty-two percent of subjects were completely dry by week 12. PST demonstrated
100% reduction in urine loss at each visit, with 91% of subjects completely dry
by week 12. IEPD also demonstrated a 91% reduction in incontinence episodes by
week 12. Quality of life scores and patient satisfaction surveys demonstrated
significant improvement. During the 6-week post device utilization period (PUP), 
subjects continued to demonstrate a reduction in urine loss compared to
pre-enrollment data, despite discontinuation of use. PdWt measurements
demonstrated a 73% and 79% reduction in urine loss at weeks 14 and 18,
respectively. Measurements of PST and IEPD demonstrated significant reductions in
urine loss at weeks 14 and 18. A 1.5% prevalence of positive urine cultures was
noted during device use. Bothersome vaginal or urethral irritation occurred in
12% of patients. Adverse events were few and required no therapeutic
intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: The CapSure shield is a safe and efficacious method of managing
stress urinary incontinence in women.
