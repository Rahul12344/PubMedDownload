KEY POINTS: Silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1)
activity and content increased significantly in overload-induced hypertrophy.
SIRT1-mediated signalling through Akt, the endothelial nitric oxide synthase
mediated pathway, regulates anabolic process in the hypertrophy of skeletal
muscle. The regulation of catabolic signalling via forkhead box O 1 and protein
ubiquitination is SIRT1 dependent. Overload-induced changes in microRNA levels
regulate SIRT1 and insulin-like growth factor 1 signalling.
ABSTRACT: Significant skeletal muscle mass guarantees functional wellbeing and is
important for high level performance in many sports. Although the molecular
mechanism for skeletal muscle hypertrophy has been well studied, it still is not 
completely understood. In the present study, we used a functional overload model 
to induce plantaris muscle hypertrophy by surgically removing the soleus and
gastrocnemius muscles in rats. Two weeks of muscle ablation resulted in a 40%
increase in muscle mass, which was associated with a significant increase in
silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1 (SIRT1) content and
activity (P < 0.001). SIRT1-regulated Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and 
GLUT4 levels were also induced in hypertrophied muscles, and SIRT1 levels
correlated with muscle mass, paired box protein 7 (Pax7), proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) levels.
Alternatively, decreased forkhead box O 1 (FOXO1) and increased K48
polyubiquitination also suggest that SIRT1 could be involved in the catabolic
process of hypertrophy. Furthermore, increased levels of K63 and muscle RING
finger 2 (MuRF2) protein could also be important enhancers of muscle mass. We
report here that the levels of miR1 and miR133a decrease in hypertrophy and
negatively correlate with muscle mass, SIRT1 and Nampt levels. Our results reveal
a strong correlation between SIRT1 levels and activity, SIRT1-regulated pathways 
and overload-induced hypertrophy. These findings, along with the well-known
regulatory roles that SIRT1 plays in modulating both anabolic and catabolic
pathways, allow us to propose the hypothesis that SIRT1 may actually play a
crucial causal role in overload-induced hypertrophy of skeletal muscle. This
hypothesis will now require rigorous direct and functional testing.
