Immunotherapy with T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is an
attractive approach to improve outcomes for patients with glioblastoma (GBM).
IL13Rα2 is expressed at a high frequency in GBM but not in normal brain, making
it a promising CAR T-cell therapy target. IL13Rα2-specific CARs generated up to
date contain mutated forms of IL13 as an antigen-binding domain. While these CARs
target IL13Rα2, they also recognize IL13Rα1, which is broadly expressed. To
overcome this limitation, we constructed a panel of IL13Rα2-specific CARs that
contain the IL13Rα2-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) 47 as an
antigen binding domain, short or long spacer regions, a transmembrane domain, and
endodomains derived from costimulatory molecules and CD3.ζ (IL13Rα2-CARs).
IL13Rα2-CAR T cells recognized IL13Rα2-positive target cells in coculture and
cytotoxicity assays with no cross-reactivity to IL13Rα1. However, only
IL13Rα2-CAR T cells with a short spacer region produced IL2 in an
antigen-dependent fashion. In vivo, T cells expressing IL13Rα2-CARs with short
spacer regions and CD28.ζ, 41BB.ζ, and CD28.OX40.ζ endodomains had potent
anti-glioma activity conferring a significant survival advantage in comparison to
mice that received control T cells. Thus, IL13Rα2-CAR T cells hold the promise to
improve current IL13Rα2-targeted immunotherapy approaches for GBM and other
IL13Rα2-positive malignancies.
