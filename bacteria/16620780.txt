The signal transduction pathway involved in hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF)-induced capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells was investigated.
HGF-induced capillary morphogenesis of the murine spleen endothelial cell line
MSS31 was inhibited by a Src family kinase inhibitor, PP2. Stable expression of
kinase-inactive Src in MSS31 cells inhibited HGF-induced activation of Src as
well as capillary morphogenesis. The HGF-induced capillary morphogenesis of human
umbilical vein endothelial cells was also inhibited by PP2 and was reduced by the
downregulation of Src by small interfering RNA. These results suggest that HGF
induces capillary morphogenesis of endothelial cells through Src.
