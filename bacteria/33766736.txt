AIM OF THE STUDY: The increase in the number of brucellosis cases between 2014
and 2017 (14 and 90 cases respectively) led us to study the biological and
clinical-epidemiologic characteristics patients hospitalized in Rabta hospital of
Tunis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in Rabta Hospital in
Tunis between 2016 and 2017.  It includes 131 patients who had a positive
bacteriological diagnosis of Brucella between 2016 and 2017. Diagnosis of
brucellosis was made in blood culture by using Bactalert (Biomerieux®).
Identification of Brucella was realized by Gram staining, catalase, oxydase.
Serological diagnosis was made by testing sera for brucellosis agglutinins with
Rose Bengale and the standard agglutination test. The collected data were
analyzed by SPSS softcare version 24.
RESULTS: The prevalence of Brucellosis in Rabta hospital increases from 14 cases 
in 2014 to 90 cases in 2017. The mean age was 45 years and ages range from 16 to 
84 years. Rural origin was found in 75 cases (68%). Ninety seven patients (89%)
were hospitalized in the infectious diseases department. The average length of
hospitalization was 17.25 days. Fifty-seven patients (52%) had a history of
consuming unpasteurized dairy products and 45 (41%) were farmers. Fever was the
predominant symptom in 104 cases (95%). Osteoarticular involvement is the most
common complication of brucellosis and it occurred in 28% of patients. Blood
cultures were 73 cases and 42 (57%) were positive for Brucella spp. Rose Bengale 
was positive in 100% of cases. High titles of the standard agglutination test
(superior to 1/1280) were noted in 24 cases (22%).
CONCLUSION: Brucellosis is still endemic In Tunisia. Contact with domestic
animals and consumption of raw milk and milk products seems to be the major mode 
of transmission. Control of animal infection by vaccination, occupational and
personal hygiene, farm sanitation and preventive measures can reduce disease
incidence.
