A 58-year-old man with a history of Ludwig's angina was admitted with a spinal
cord abscess at the level of C2-T1 and associated osteomyelitic destruction of
vertebral bodies, spinal cord compression, and secondary quadriparesis, followed 
by descending mediastinitis. A right posterolateral thoracotomy and a cervicotomy
drained purulent exudates. A tracheostomy was performed, and the patient was
discharged after 84 days.
