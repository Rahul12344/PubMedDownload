An expansion phase precedes terminal erythroid differentiation of hematopoietic
progenitor cells from cord blood in vitro and is associated with up-regulation of
cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2.

The dynamics of cell cycle regulation were investigated during in vitro erythroid
proliferation and differentiation of CD34(+) cord blood cells. An unusual cell
cycle profile with a majority of cells in S phase (70.2%) and minority of cells
in G1 phase (27.4%) was observed in burst-forming unit-erythrocytes
(BFU-E)-derived erythroblasts from a 7-day culture of CD34(+) cells stimulated
with interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), Steel factor, and Epo. Terminal erythroid differentiation was
accompanied by a rapid increase of G0/G1 phase cells. Expression of cyclin E and 
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (cdk2) correlated with the proportion of S phase cells.
Cyclin D3 was moderately up-regulated during the proliferation phase, and both
cyclin E and D3 were rapidly down-regulated during terminal differentiation. This
suggests that the high proliferation potential of erythroblasts is associated
with temporal up-regulation of cyclin E and cdk2. (Blood. 2000;96:3985-3987)
