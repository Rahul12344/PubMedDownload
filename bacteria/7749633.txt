Specific polyclonal antibodies towards the oxidized form of bovine thioredoxin
reductase (TR) have been obtained in rabbits, and purified. The antigenicity was 
lost upon reduction of TR by NADPH indicating a large conformational change upon 
reduction of the redox-active disulfide in the enzyme. The antibodies did not
cross-react with other bovine NADPH-dependent dehydrogenases. No reactivity was
observed with TR from bacteria, yeast or rat and only a slight reaction was
obtained with TR from horse. Immunoaffinity purified anti-thioredoxin and
anti-glutaredoxin antibodies were used to develop competitive indirect ELISA
assays that were validated giving very good linearity, reproducibility,
sensitivity and parallelism. The glutaredoxin (Grx) immunoassay is the first
quantitative method described to measure the protein. When applied to a battery
of calf tissues the contents of Grx varied from 7 to 120 micrograms per gram of
fresh tissue. Skeletal and heart muscles gave the lowest values and spleen and
salivary glands the highest. However, skeletal muscle showed the highest
gluthathione-hydroxyethyl disulfide oxidoreductase specific activity.
