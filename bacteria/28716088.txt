BACKGROUND: The disco-interacting protein 2 homolog C (DIP2C) gene is an
uncharacterized gene found mutated in a subset of breast and lung cancers. To
understand the role of DIP2C in tumour development we studied the gene in human
cancer cells.
METHODS: We engineered human DIP2C knockout cells by genome editing in cancer
cells. The growth properties of the engineered cells were characterised and
transcriptome and methylation analyses were carried out to identify pathways
deregulated by inactivation of DIP2C. Effects on cell death pathways and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition traits were studied based on the results from
expression profiling.
RESULTS: Knockout of DIP2C in RKO cells resulted in cell enlargement and growth
retardation. Expression profiling revealed 780 genes for which the expression
level was affected by the loss of DIP2C, including the tumour-suppressor encoding
CDKN2A gene, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulator-encoding ZEB1,
and CD44 and CD24 that encode breast cancer stem cell markers. Analysis of DNA
methylation showed more than 30,000 sites affected by differential methylation,
the majority of which were hypomethylated following loss of DIP2C. Changes in DNA
methylation at promoter regions were strongly correlated to changes in gene
expression, and genes involved with EMT and cell death were enriched among the
differentially regulated genes. The DIP2C knockout cells had higher wound closing
capacity and showed an increase in the proportion of cells positive for cellular 
senescence markers.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of DIP2C triggers substantial DNA methylation and gene
expression changes, cellular senescence and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in 
cancer cells.
