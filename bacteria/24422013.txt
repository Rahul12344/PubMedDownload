OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the mouthwash
use questionnaire to determine the lifetime exposure to alcohol from mouthwash
and verify that it was suitable for use in general population.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were available from three consecutive studies, all
collecting information on mouthwash use. In addition, supermarkets and online
stores were screened for the brands of mouthwash they sold. Alcohol content of
mouthwash was identified from various sources, including laboratory measurements.
Alcohol-containing mouthwash use was converted to glasses of wine equivalent.
RESULTS: Mouthwash was used by 62% of the participants, and the main benefits
reported were refreshment of bad breath (75%), elimination of bacteria (68%) and 
reduction of plaque formation (47%). Majority mouthwashes used by the
participants contained alcohol (61%). Life-time exposure from alcohol in
mouthwash was relatively small for most of the study participants: 79% had rinsed
for less than one year with alcohol equivalent of one glass of wine per day.
There was substantial agreement in mouthwash reporting between different
occasions (Kappa > 0.62).
CONCLUSIONS: The questionnaire can be used to investigate mouthwash use in the
general population and to measure alcohol intake from mouthwash.
