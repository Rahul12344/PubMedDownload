Mouse complement component C1q is a serum glycoprotein which consists of six A
chains, six B chains and six C chains. The three polypeptides are 223, 228, and
217 residues long, respectively, and are encoded by three genes. DNA probes for
mouse C1q A, B, and C chains were hybridized to Southern blots of DNA obtained
from various inbred mouse strains. On the basis of fragment length polymorphisms,
two different alleles of each of the genes could be identified. The distribution 
of these alleles was determined in the BXD and LXPL recombinant inbred strain
series. Comparison with previously reported strain distribution patterns shows
that the genes encoding mouse C1q map to the same locus on distal chromosome 4.
Overlapping clones spanning the entire gene cluster of C1q were isolated from
genomic libraries using specific cDNA probes. The three genes C1qA, C1qB, and
C1qC are closely arranged on a 19 kilobase stretch of DNA in the 5' to 3'
orientation A-C-B. Each gene consists of two exons separated by one intron.
Sequence comparison of C1q from three different species have shown that the B
chains have the strongest similarity. Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA
from 14 vertebrate species demonstrated highest similarity between the C1qB
genes, followed by C1qC and finally C1qA.
