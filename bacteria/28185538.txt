BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide 
being a highly contagious and insidious illness caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Mtb. Additionally, the emergence of multidrug-resistant and
extensively drug-resistant strains of Mtb, together with significant levels of
co-infection with HIV and TB (HIV/TB) make the search for new antitubercular
drugs urgent and challenging.
METHODS: This work was based on the hypothesis that an active compound could be
obtained if substituents present in some other active compounds were attached on 
a core of an important structure, in this case the indole scaffold, thus
generating a hybrid compound. A QSAR-oriented design based on classification and 
regression models along with the estimation of physicochemical and biological
properties have also been used to assist in the selection of compounds. Chosen
compounds were synthesized using various synthetic procedures and evaluated
against M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain.
RESULTS: Selected compounds possess substituents at positions C5, C2 and N1 of
the indole ring. The substituents involve p-halophenyl, pyridyl, benzyloxy and
benzylamine groups. Four compounds were synthesised using suitable synthetic
procedures to attain the desired substitution at the indole core. From these,
three compounds are new and have been fully characterized, and tested in vitro
against the H37Rv ATCC27294T Mtb strain, using isoniazid as a control. One of
them, compound 2, with the pyridyl group at N1, has an experimental log (1/MIC)
very close to 5 and can be considered as being (weakly) active. In fact, it is
more active than 64% of all indole molecules in our data sets of experimental
results from literature. The most active indole in this data sets has log
(1/MIC)=5.93 with only 6 compounds with log (1/MIC) above 5.5.
CONCLUSION: Despite the lower activity found for the tested compounds, when
compared to other reported indole-derivatives, these structures, which rely on a 
hybrid design concept, may constitute interesting scaffolds to prepare a new
family of TB inhibitors with improved activity.
