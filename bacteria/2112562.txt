Clostridium difficile is the cause of antibiotic-associated colitis in humans.
The organism produces toxin A, which is generally known as the enterotoxin, and
toxin B, which is known as the cytotoxin. Toxin A has been reported to have
slight cytotoxic activity; in this study we show that cell lines (F9, OTF9-63,
and P19) which express a carbohydrate to which toxin A binds are more sensitive
to the toxin. These cell lines can be used as research tools for determining
concentrations of biologically active toxin A and should also prove useful for
studies of the mechanism of action of the toxin.
