Protective immunity against anthrax is inferred from measurement of vaccine
antigen-specific neutralizing antibody titers in serum samples. In animal models,
in vivo challenges with toxin and/or spores can also be performed. However,
neither of these approaches considers toxin-induced damage to specific organ
systems. It is therefore important to determine to what extent anthrax vaccines
and existing or candidate adjuvants can provide organ-specific protection against
intoxication. We therefore compared the ability of Alum, CpG DNA and the CD1d
ligand α-galactosylceramide (αGC) to enhance protective antigen-specific antibody
titers, to protect mice against challenge with lethal toxin, and to block
cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity. By measurement of serum cardiac Troponin I
(cTnI), and hepatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), it was apparent that neither vaccine modality prevented
hepatic intoxication, despite high Ab titers and ultimate survival of the
subject. In contrast, cardiotoxicity was greatly diminished by prior
immunization. This shows that a vaccine that confers survival following toxin
exposure may still have an associated morbidity. We propose that organ-specific
intoxication should be monitored routinely during research into new vaccine
modalities.
