Immunogenicity of 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PnPS) conjugate vaccine 
(PCV13) was evaluated in 38 rheumatoid arthritis patients under immunosuppressive
treatment and 20 healthy controls (HC). Antibodies to all PnPS and
diphtheria-toxin analogue conjugate protein were measured pre- (T0), 1 (T1), 6
(T2), 12 (T3) months post-immunization. Patients and HC had similar response to
individual PnPS. Mean antibody levels to all PnPS but one doubled at T1 compared 
with T0, with T3 persistence for only 8-7/13 PnPS. Baseline antibody levels was
inversely associated with the rate of responders at T1 (T1/T0≥2) to 11/13 PnPS.
Few subjects reached protective IgG levels against some serotypes frequently
isolated in Italian patients with invasive pneumococcal disease. Antibody
response was not influenced by therapy, except the one to PS7F, which was reduced
by tumor necrosis factor-α-inhibitors. Vaccination increased also anti-diphtheria
IgG. Despite this study substantially confirmed the PCV13 immunogenicity in
immunocompromised patients, it also revealed some limitations.
