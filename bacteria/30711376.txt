TCRs recognize cognate pMHCs to initiate T cell signaling and adaptive immunity. 
Mechanical force strengthens TCR-pMHC interactions to elicit agonist-specific
catch bonds to trigger TCR signaling, but the underlying dynamic structural
mechanism is unclear. We combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation,
single-molecule biophysical approaches, and functional assays to collectively
demonstrate that mechanical force induces conformational changes in pMHCs to
enhance pre-existing contacts and activates new interactions at the TCR-pMHC
binding interface to resist bond dissociation under force, resulting in TCR-pMHC 
catch bonds and T cell activation. Intriguingly, cancer-associated somatic
mutations in HLA-A2 that may restrict these conformational changes suppressed
TCR-pMHC catch bonds. Structural analysis also indicated that HLA polymorphism
might alter the equilibrium of these conformational changes. Our findings not
only reveal critical roles of force-induced conformational changes in pMHCs for
activating TCR-pMHC catch bonds but also have implications for T cell-based
immunotherapy.
