High-yield production of HLA-A*0201 heavy chain is a prerequisite to the
preparation of HLA-A2 tetramer. The present study was aimed to construct the
expression vector of recombinant HLA-A*0201-BSP fusion gene for preparing HLA-A2 
tetramers. The extracellular region HLA*0201 was cloned by RT-PCR from HLA-A2(+) 
donor, and a 15-amino acid biotin-protein ligase (BirA) substrate peptide (BSP)
for BirA-dependent biotinylation was added to the COOH-terminus of HLA-A*0201
heavy chain. Then the fusion gene was cloned into pBV220 vector at EcoRI and Bam 
HI sites and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The recombinant
plasmid pBV220-HLA-A*0201-BSP was transformed to the competent cells of E.coli
DH5alpha. The results showed that the HLA-A*0201-BSP fusion protein was
successfully expressed in the form of inclusion body and amounted to over 28% of 
total cell proteins via induction at 42 degrees C. After washed with triton X-100
and urea, the inclusion body was dissolved with 8 mol/L urea and then purified
with Sepharcyl S-300 HR, and the final purity reached above 90%. It is concluded 
that the HLA-A*0201-BSP fusion gene was cloned successfully and expressed
efficiently in E.coli DH5alpha. This work establishes a convenient approach for
purification of large quantity of recombinant HLA-A*0201-BSP. This provides the
basis for the preparation of HLA-A2 tetramers.
