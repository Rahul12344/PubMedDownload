The effects of various combinations of iron compounds on the contaminant removal 
performance in constructed wetlands (CWs) were explored under various initial
iron concentrations, contaminant concentrations, different hydraulic retention
time (HRT), and different temperatures. The Combo 6 (nanoscale zero-valent iron
combined with Fe3+) in CW treatments showed the highest pollutant removal
performance under the conditions of C2 initial iron dosage concentration (total
iron 0.2 mM) and I2 initial contaminant concentration
(COD:TN:TP = 60 mg/L:60 mg/L:1 mg/L) in influent after 72-h HRT. These results
were directly verified by two different microbial tests (Biolog test and
high-throughput pyrosequencing) and microbial community analysis (principal
component analysis of community-level physiological profile, biodiversity index, 
cluster tree, relative abundance at order of taxonomy level). Specific bacteria
related to significant improvements in contaminant removal were domesticated by
various combinations of iron compounds. Iron dosage was advised as a green, new, 
and effective option for wastewater treatment. Graphical Abstract .
