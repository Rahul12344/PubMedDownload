Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among members of the family
Enterobacteriaceae generally involves resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and
monobactams, while implying different susceptibility profiles with other
antimicrobial agents. We have investigated the activity of some beta-lactam
antibiotics, alone or in double and triple combinations with beta-lactamase
inhibitors, in the presence or absence of tobramycin (TOB), against some
Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBL by means of time-kill curves. Antimicrobials
employed were ceftazidime (CAZ), cefotaxime (CTX), TOB, ampicillin (AMP),
ampicillin-sulbactam (ASL), amoxicillin (AML), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC),
piperacillin (PIP) and piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP), at 1/4 minimum inhibitory
concentration for susceptible strains and at achievable serum concentrations for 
resistant strains. Only the combinations CTX-ASL, CAZ-ASL and PIP-ASL were
synergistic, both at 6 and 24 h, on some strains of Klebsiella species.
