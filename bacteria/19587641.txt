The gastrointestinal tract allows the residence of an almost enumerable number of
bacteria. To maintain homeostasis, the mucosal immune system must remain tolerant
to the commensal microbiota and eradicate pathogenic bacteria. Aberrant
interactions between the mucosal immune cells and the microbiota have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD). In this review, we discuss the role of natural killer T
cells (NKT cells) in intestinal immunology. NKT cells are a subset of
non-conventional T cells recognizing endogenous and/or exogenous glycolipid
antigens when presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
I-like antigen-presenting molecules CD1d and MR1. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR)
engagement, NKT cells can rapidly produce various cytokines that have important
roles in mucosal immunity. Our understanding of NKT-cell-mediated pathways
including the identification of specific antigens is expanding. This knowledge
will facilitate the development of NKT cell-based interventions and immune
therapies for human intestinal diseases.
