C6-Schiff bases derivatives of chitosan were synthesized for the first time.
C2-amino groups and C3-hydroxy groups were firstly protected by CuSO4·5H2O, and
the C6-hydroxy was then transformed into aldehyde, which then reacted with
anilines through nucleophilic addition to introduce the CN group at C6-position
in chitosan chain. Finally, C6-Schiff bases derivatives of chitosan were got by
the deprotection of C2-NH2 with cation exchange resin. The structures and
properties of the new synthesized products were characterized by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C NMR, SEM image, and elemental analysis. The 
antibacterial activities of derivatives were tested in the experiment, and the
results showed that the prepared chitosan derivatives had significantly improved 
antibacterial activity toward Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The
Cytotoxicity test showed that the prepared chitosan derivatives had low
Cytotoxicity, compared with chitosan and C2-benzaldehyde Schiff bases of
chitosan. This paper allowed a new method for the synthesis of Schiff bases of
chitosan, which was enlightening.
