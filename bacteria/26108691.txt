The TLX1 transcription factor is critically involved in the multi-step
pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and often cooperates 
with NOTCH1 activation during malignant T-cell transformation. However, the exact
molecular mechanism by which these T-cell specific oncogenes cooperate during
transformation remains to be established. Here, we used chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing to establish the genome-wide binding
pattern of TLX1 in human T-ALL. This integrative genomics approach showed that
ectopic TLX1 expression drives repression of T cell-specific enhancers and
mediates an unexpected transcriptional antagonism with NOTCH1 at critical target 
genes, including IL7R and NOTCH3. These phenomena coordinately trigger a
TLX1-driven pre-leukemic phenotype in human thymic precursor cells, reminiscent
of the thymus regression observed in murine TLX1 tumor models, and create a
strong genetic pressure for acquiring activating NOTCH1 mutations as a
prerequisite for full leukemic transformation. In conclusion, our results uncover
a functional antagonism between cooperative oncogenes during the earliest phases 
of tumor development and provide novel insights in the multi-step pathogenesis of
TLX1-driven human leukemia.
