BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules are known to play an
important role in host-defense mechanisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
the association between HLA alleles and lung disease caused by nontuberculous
mycobacteria (NTM) in Korean patients.
METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with NTM lung disease (48 patients with
Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex [MAC] infection and 30 patients with
Mycobacterium abscessus infection) were included in the study. HLA-A, -B, and
-DRB1 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction using
sequence-specific primers. Data from 485 healthy Korean individuals were used as 
a control.
RESULTS: When compared to controls, patients with NTM lung disease showed an
increased frequency of DRB1*11 (OR = 1.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
1.01-3.64, p = 0.045, corrected p [pC] > 0.05). In the subgroup analysis,
patients with MAC lung disease had an increased frequency of B*46 (OR = 2.23, 95%
CI = 1.05-4.73, p = 0.044, pC > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that in a Korean population, patients with NTM lung
disease and healthy subjects differ in the frequencies of some HLA alleles.
However, when considering corrected p values, our findings are inconclusive.
