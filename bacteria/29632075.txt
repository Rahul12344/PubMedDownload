Aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO) is an essential enzyme for production of
long-chain alkanes as drop-in biofuels, which are compatible with existing fuel
systems. The most active ADOs are present in mesophilic cyanobacteria, especially
Nostoc punctiforme Given the potential applications of thermostable enzymes in
biorefineries, here we generated a thermostable (Cts)-ADO based on a consensus of
ADO sequences from several thermophilic cyanobacterial strains. Using an in
silico design pipeline and a metagenome library containing 41 hot-spring
microbial communities, we created Cts-ADO. Cts-ADO displayed a 3.8-fold increase 
in pentadecane production on raising the temperature from 30 to 42 °C, whereas
ADO from N. punctiforme (Np-ADO) exhibited a 1.7-fold decline. 3D structure
modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of Cts- and Np-ADO at different
temperatures revealed differences between the two enzymes in residues clustered
on exposed loops of these variants, which affected the conformation of helices
involved in forming the ADO catalytic core. In Cts-ADO, this conformational
change promoted ligand binding to its preferred iron, Fe2, in the di-iron cluster
at higher temperature, but the reverse was observed in Np-ADO. Detailed mapping
of residues conferring Cts-ADO thermostability identified four amino acids, which
we substituted individually and together in Np-ADO. Among these substitution
variants, A161E was remarkably similar to Cts-ADO in terms of activity optima,
kinetic parameters, and structure at higher temperature. A161E was located in
loop L6, which connects helices H5 and H6, and supported ligand binding to Fe2 at
higher temperatures, thereby promoting optimal activity at these temperatures and
explaining the increased thermostability of Cts-ADO.
