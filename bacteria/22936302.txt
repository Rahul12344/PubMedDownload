Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152) is a transmembrane
protein that is structurally similar to CD28. As CTLA-4 has a much higher binding
affinity to B7 than CD28, several approaches using soluble CTLA-4 have been tried
to down-regulate T cell activity by blocking the interaction between CD28 and B7.
We constructed soluble rhesus monkey CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA-4Ig) containing 
a critical binding site to B7 combined with a constant Ig heavy chain region in a
mammalian system. Flow cytometry analyses indicated that soluble rhesus monkey
CTLA-4Ig bound to rhesus monkey CD86 (B7.2). Moreover, soluble rhesus monkey
CTLA-4Ig more effectively blocked the rhesus monkey-rhesus monkey allogeneic
mixed lymphocyte reaction compared with that of humans. These results indicate
that soluble rhesus monkey CTLA-4Ig may be useful in preclinical trials in a
rhesus monkey model.
