BACKGROUND: For the production of carboxylic acid platform chemicals like
medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) by anaerobic fermentation, pH control is
required. However, adding buffer solutions is ineffective in leach-bed reactors.
AIM: In order to increase the MCFA production by maize silage fermentation and to
engineer the process we investigated the effect of solid alkaline iron and
manganese additives on the process performance and microbial community dynamics.
RESULTS: Without additives, the pH dropped to 3.9 and lactic acid bacteria were
favored. Total product yields of 207 ± 5.4 g organic acids (C2-C6) and alcohols
per kg volatile solids were reached. The addition of trace elements increased the
pH value and the product spectrum and yields changed. With a commercial iron
additive, the product yields were higher (293 ± 15.2 g/kgvolatile solids) and
supposedly clostridia used lactic acid for microbial chain elongation of acetic
acid producing n-butyric acid. With the addition of pure Fe(OH)3 or Mn(OH)2, the 
total product yields were lower than in the other reactors. However, increased
production of MCFA and the occurrence of distinct bacterial taxa
(Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Megasphaera) related to this metabolic
function were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: The application of alkaline trace metal additives as pH stabilizing 
agents can mitigate spatial metabolic heterogeneities when trace metal deficient 
substrates like specific crops or residues thereof are applied.
