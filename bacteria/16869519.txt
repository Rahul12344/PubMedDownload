Specific binding of nuclear proteins, in particular transcription factors, to
target DNA sequences is a major mechanism of genome functioning and gene
expression regulation in eukaryotes. Therefore, identification and mapping
specific protein target sites (PTS) is necessary for understanding genomic
regulation. Here we used a novel two-dimensional electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (2D-EMSA) procedure for identification and mapping of 52 PTS within a
563-kb human genome region located between the FXYD5 and TZFP genes. The PTS
occurred with approximately equal frequency within unique and repetitive genomic 
regions. PTS belonging to unique sequences tended to group together within gene
introns and close to their 5' and 3' ends, whereas PTS located within repeats
were evenly distributed between transcribed and intragenic regions.
