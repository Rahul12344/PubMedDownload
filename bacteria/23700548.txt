Obesity is associated with a low-grade, chronic inflammation that promotes the
development of a variety of diseases, most notably type 2 diabetes. A number of
cell types of the innate and adaptive immune systems have been implicated in this
process. Recent studies have focused on the role of natural killer T (NKT) cells,
a subset of T lymphocytes that react with lipids, in the development of
obesity-associated diseases. These studies have shown that invariant NKT (iNKT)
cells, a population of NKT cells expressing a semi-invariant T cell receptor,
become rapidly activated in response to lipid excess, and that these cells
influence the capacity of other leukocytes to produce cytokines during the
progression of obesity. The role of NKT cells in obesity-associated inflammation 
and insulin resistance has been investigated using NKT cell-deficient animals,
adoptive transfer of NKT cells and an iNKT cell agonist. While divergent results 
have been obtained, it is now clear that NKT cells can modulate the inflammatory 
milieu in obesity, suggesting that these cells could be targeted for therapeutic 
intervention in obesity-associated diseases.
