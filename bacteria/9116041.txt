We isolated an rpoD2 gene encoding the potential sigma factor of RNA polymerase
from the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa K-81, which can perform
photosynthesis. The deduced amino acid sequence of RpoD2 (sigmaA2) exhibits
extensive homology to other eubacterial RpoD proteins. This gene possessed
multiple 5'-end transcripts, expressed specifically under light (P(L)), dark
(P(D)), or constitutively light/dark (P(C)) conditions during exponential cell
growth.
