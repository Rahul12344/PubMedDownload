IL-36 cytokines are critical regulators of mucosal inflammation and homeostasis. 
IL-36γ regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines and antimicrobial
proteins by gingival epithelial cells (e.g. TIGK cells). Here, we show that
IL-36γ also regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) and
neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), important mediators of
antimicrobial immunity and tissue homeostasis in mucosal epithelia. MMP9 and NGAL
were not similarly induced by IL-17 or IL-22, thus indicating the importance of
IL-36γ in the regulation of MMP9 and NGAL. Mechanistically, MMP9 and NGAL
expression was demonstrated to be induced in an IRAK1- and NF-κB-dependent
manner. Furthermore, signaling by p38 MAP kinase may enable their expression to
be independently regulated by IL-36γ. The stronger IL-36γ-inducible expression of
MMP9 and NGAL in terminally differentiating TIGK cells suggests that control of
their expression is associated with the maturation of the gingival epithelium.
Although MMP9 and NGAL expression in epithelial cells can also be induced by
bacteria, their expression in TIGK cells was not induced by the periodontal
pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis, most likely due to antagonism by the gingipain
proteinase virulence factors. This study advances our understanding of how IL-36γ
may promote oral mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis, and how this may be
dysregulated by bacterial pathogens.
