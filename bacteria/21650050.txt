pUDK-HGF, the recombinant plasmid DNA encoding human hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), can treat ischaemic disease. A great quantity of pharmaceutical pUDK-HGF
is needed. A pilot-scale production process of pUDK-HGF was established based on 
a new chromatographic media (plasmidselect), including fermentation, cell
harvesting, alkaline lysis, ultrafiltration, RNA removing and buffer exchanging
on Sephacryl S-1000, capturing supercoiled plasmid DNA with plasmidselect, and
removing the salt with Sepharose 6BFF. The process does not use RNase enzyme and 
toxic solvents.
