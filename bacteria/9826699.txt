Natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity is regulated in large part by the
expression of NK cell receptors able to bind class I major histocompatibility
complex glycoproteins. The receptors associated with recognition of HLA-C
allospecificities are the two-domain Ig-like molecules, p50 and p58 proteins,
with highly homologous extracellular domains but differing in that they have
either an activating or inhibitory function, respectively, depending on the
transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tails that they possess. We have compared
the binding to HLA-Cw7 of an inhibitory p58 molecule, NKAT2, the highly
homologous activating p50 molecule, clone 49, and a second activating p50
molecule, clone 39, which has homologies to both NKAT1 and NKAT2. NKAT2 binds to 
HLA-Cw7 with very rapid association and dissociation rates. However, the p50
receptors bind only very weakly, if at all, to HLA-C. The molecular basis of this
difference is analyzed, and the functional significance of these observations is 
discussed.
