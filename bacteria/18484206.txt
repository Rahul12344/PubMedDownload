In patients suffering from infective endocarditis (IE), initial symptoms and
clinical findings are unspecific. Physicians primarily involved should always
consider IE a potential diagnosis. Any delay in diagnosis and thus in an adequate
antimicrobial therapy has a significant negative prognostic influence. Any
subject suspected to have IE should immediately have a transthoracic
echocardiography (TTE) by an experienced examiner. If the TTE results are
inconclusive, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has to be performed without 
delay. Other steps in diagnosis, medical and surgical therapy follow established 
and evidenced-based guidelines. Antimicrobial regimens are standardized for IE,
for which demonstration of causative microorganisms from blood cultures or other 
microbiological sources is unavoidable. If there are problems in diagnosis, if
difficult-to-treat microoganisms are isolated or difficult-to-treat situations
complicate active IE, a reference center should be involved.
