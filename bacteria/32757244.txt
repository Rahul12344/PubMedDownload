BACKGROUND: Intra bone marrow (IBM) injection has been proposed as a strategy to 
bypass homing inefficiencies associated with intravenous (IV) hematopoietic
progenitor stem cell (HSPC) transplantation and thus increases the number of HSPC
that engraft. Despite physical delivery into the bone marrow cavity, many donor
cells are rapidly redistributed by vascular perfusion. Thus, the objective of our
study was to evaluate the ability of human platelet lysates (hPL) to improve HSPC
retention into the bone marrow and consequently to improve engraftment.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: HSPC were isolated from human umbilical cord blood.
HSPC were seeded in the wells of a 24-well microplate and exposed to increasing
concentrations of hPL with or without cytokines for 24 hours. Following priming, 
HSPC cells chemotaxis to rhSDF-1 was determined in vitro and engraftment in NSG
mice was evaluated.
RESULTS: Priming of cord blood CD34+ cells to a combination of hPL and cytokines 
resulted in a significant increase (up to 3-fold) in the expression of the CD34
antigen on HSPC. This effect was closely correlated to a significantly increased 
(up to 7-fold) migration toward a rhSDF-1 concentration gradient. In addition,
IBM injection of CD34+ cells previously primed with hPL+cytokines into NSG mice
showed significantly increased engraftment as measured by human platelet numbers,
human CD45 and human CD34+ cells for unprimed and primed cells, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The use of hPL + cytokines as a short-term priming treatment for UCB 
could be an advantageous strategy to improve clinical outcomes following IBM
injection.
