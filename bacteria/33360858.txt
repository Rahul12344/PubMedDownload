BACKGROUND: Human adenovirus (HAdV) species B, C, and E are commonly associated
with acute respiratory illnesses (ARI). We sought to determine the association
between HAdV species and ARI severity in children over one respiratory season at 
Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children with HAdV from a
provider-ordered BioFire® FilmArray Respiratory Pathogen Panel 2.0 (RPP) from
05/2018-06/2019. Type-specific PCR assays for HAdV-B3, B7, B11, B14, B16, B21,
HAdV-C1, C2, C5, C6, and HAdV-E4 were performed. Demographics, clinical
characteristics, and outcome data were compared between HAdV species.
RESULTS: Of 4514 respiratory specimens collected, 2644 (59 %) had at least one
pathogen detected by RPP, and 384 (15 %) were HAdV-positive; 342 (89 %) were
available for research testing with 306 (89 %) specimens from unique symptomatic 
individuals; 237 (77 %) were positive for the following species: 104 (44 %)
HAdV-B, 114 (48 %) HAdV-C, 9 (4%) HAdV-E, and 10 (4%) with co-detection between
species. The majority with identified HAdV species were seen in the ED (62 %),
and approximately one-third were hospitalized. Patients with HAdV-C were more
likely to be younger, hospitalized, and have a higher frequency of seizures
compared to HAdV-B.
CONCLUSION: HAdV-C and HAdV-B were the most common species detected, with
differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes noted. Additional studies
with larger sample sizes focusing on a high-risk pediatric population are
necessary to determine if differences in illness severity across individual HAdV 
types exist to guide further type-specific HAdV vaccine development.
