HLA-E presented antigens are interesting targets for vaccination given HLA-Es'
essentially monomorphic nature. We have shown previously that Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) peptides are presented by HLA-E to CD8+ effector T cells, but 
the precise phenotype and functional capacity of these cells remains poorly
characterized. We have developed and utilized in this study a new protocol
combining HLA-E tetramer with intracellular staining for cytokines, transcription
factors and cytotoxic molecules to characterize these cells in depth. We confirm 
in this study the significantly increased ex vivo frequency of
Mtb-peptide/HLA-E-TM+ CD8+ T cells in the circulation of patients with active
tuberculosis (TB). HLA-E restricted CD8+ T cells from TB patients produced more
IL-13 than cells from controls or subjects with latent tuberculosis infection
(LTBI). Compared to total CD8+ T cells, HLA-E restricted cells produced more
IFNγ, IL-4, IL-10, and granulysin but less granzyme-A. Moreover, compared to
"classical" Mtb specific HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cells, HLA-E restricted CD8+
T cells produced less TNFα and perforin, but more IL-4. In conclusion, HLA-E
restricted- Mtb specific cells can produce Th2 cytokines directly.
