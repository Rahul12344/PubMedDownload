BACKGROUND: Phlomis plants are a source of biological active substances with
potential applications in the control of phytopathogens. Phlomis purpurea
(Lamiaceae) is autochthonous of southern Iberian Peninsula and Morocco and was
found to be resistant to Phytophthora cinnamomi. Phlomis purpurea has revealed
antagonistic effect in the rhizosphere of Quercus suber and Q. ilex against P.
cinnamomi. Phlomis purpurea roots produce bioactive compounds exhibiting
antitumor and anti-Phytophthora activities with potential to protect susceptible 
plants. Although these important capacities of P. purpurea have been
demonstrated, there is no transcriptomic or genomic information available in
public databases that could bring insights on the genes underlying this
anti-oomycete activity.
RESULTS: Using Illumina technology we obtained a de novo assembly of P. purpurea 
transcriptome and differential transcript abundance to identify putative defence 
related genes in challenged versus non-challenged plants. A total of
1,272,600,000 reads from 18 cDNA libraries were merged and assembled into 215,739
transcript contigs. BLASTX alignment to Nr NCBI database identified 124,386
unique annotated transcripts (57.7%) with significant hits. Functional annotation
identified 83,550 out of 124,386 unique transcripts, which were mapped to 141
pathways. 39% of unigenes were assigned GO terms. Their functions cover
biological processes, cellular component and molecular functions. Genes
associated with response to stimuli, cellular and primary metabolic processes,
catalytic and transporter functions were among those identified. Differential
transcript abundance analysis using DESeq revealed significant differences among 
libraries depending on post-challenge times. Comparative cyto-histological
studies of P. purpurea roots challenged with P. cinnamomi zoospores and controls 
revealed specific morphological features (exodermal strips and epi-cuticular
layer), that may provide a constitutive efficient barrier against pathogen
penetration. Genes involved in cutin biosynthesis and in exodermal Casparian
strips formation were up-regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: The de novo assembly of transcriptome using short reads for a
non-model plant, P. purpurea, revealed many unique transcripts useful for further
gene expression, biological function, genomics and functional genomics studies.
The data presented suggest a combination of a constitutive resistance and an
increased transcriptional response from P. purpurea when challenged with the
pathogen. This knowledge opens new perspectives for the understanding of defence 
responses underlying pathogenic oomycete/plant interaction upon challenge with P.
cinnamomi.
