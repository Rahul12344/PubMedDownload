Steroids have been found to be effective in treating symptomatic oral lichen
planus (OLP) by reducing pain and inflammation. In fact, systemic corticosteroids
should be reserved for acute exacerbation, and multiple or widespread lesions.
They may be indicated in patients whose condition is unresponsive to topical
steroids. However, various potent topical steroids have been reported to be
effective in the treatment of symptomatic OLP. They can be used as the first line
drugs in the treatment of OLP with no serious side-effects. During the therapy,
candidiasis was commonly found and in addition, bad taste, nausea, dry mouth,
sore throat and swollen mouth may occur as minor side-effects from some topical
steroids. Because OLP is a chronic disorder that requires long-term treatment,
topical steroids are recommended for the treatment OLP because of minimal
side-effects and the cost benefit. This manuscript reviews the use of steroids,
especially its topical application, in the treatment of OLP.
