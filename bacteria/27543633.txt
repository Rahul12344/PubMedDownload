Members of the Joint Working Group on Improving Underrepresented Minorities
(URMs) Persistence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
(STEM)-convened by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute-review current data and propose deliberation
about why the academic "pathways" leak more for URM than white or Asian STEM
students. They suggest expanding to include a stronger focus on the institutional
barriers that need to be removed and the types of interventions that "lift"
students' interests, commitment, and ability to persist in STEM fields. Using
Kurt Lewin's planned approach to change, the committee describes five
recommendations to increase URM persistence in STEM at the undergraduate level.
These recommendations capitalize on known successes, recognize the need for
accountability, and are framed to facilitate greater progress in the future. The 
impact of these recommendations rests upon enacting the first recommendation: to 
track successes and failures at the institutional level and collect data that
help explain the existing trends.
