Mucosal Langerhans cells (LCs) originate from pre-dendritic cells and monocytes. 
However, the mechanisms involved in their in situ development remain unclear.
Here, we demonstrate that the differentiation of murine mucosal LCs is a two-step
process. In the lamina propria, signaling via BMP7-ALK3 promotes translocation of
LC precursors to the epithelium. Within the epithelium, TGF-β1 finalizes LC
differentiation, and ALK5 is crucial to this process. Moreover, the local
microbiota has a major impact on the development of mucosal LCs, whereas LCs in
turn maintain mucosal homeostasis and prevent tissue destruction. These results
reveal the differential and sequential role of TGF-β1 and BMP7 in LC
differentiation and highlight the intimate interplay of LCs with the microbiota.
