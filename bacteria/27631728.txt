Breast cancer (BC) progression and metastases have been linked to antitumor
immunity inefficiency and particularly to natural killer (NK) cells. Killer cell 
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are the most polymorphic receptors of NK
cells. Through their interactions with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C ligands,
they modulate NK and T cell actions against target cells. Therefore, we studied
the combinatorial effect of KIR genes and their HLA-C ligands on the
susceptibility to development of BC in Saudi women. The presence of KIR genes and
HLA-C1 and HLA-C2 groups was typed in 50 Saudi patients living in Riyadh and 65
healthy controls using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. 
Our results indicated a protective effect by the KIR2DS2, 2DS3, and 2DL5A genes
against BC (OR = 0.25, 0.21, and 0.27, respectively, and p < 0.01). The
synergistic action of the three genes was observed when they occurred together,
and the absence of the three genes increased BC occurrence by 6.5-fold.
Distribution of the HLA-C1/C2 ligand between patients and controls showed an
increase in the risk of BC occurrence for the heterozygote C1/C2 (OR = 2.33; 95 %
CI = 1.08-5.02; p = 0.037) and a protective effect of the homozygote C2C2
(OR = 0.03; 95 % CI = 0.009-0.098; p < 0.001). Combinatory analyses of KIR genes 
and their HLA-C ligands showed protective effects of KIR2DL2 and 2DL3 in the
absence of their HLA-C1 ligand. These results suggested that KIR-gene content
combined with their ligand could influence the risk of BC development in women in
Saudi Arabia.
