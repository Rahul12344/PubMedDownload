Transgenic Phytophthora palmivora strains that produce green fluorescent protein 
(GFP) or beta-glucuronidase (GUS) constitutively were obtained after stable DNA
integration using a polyethylene-glycol and CaCl2-based transformation protocol. 
GFP and GUS production were monitored during several stages of the life cycle of 
P. palmivora to evaluate their use in molecular and physiological studies. 40% of
the GFP transformants produced the GFP to a level detectable by a confocal laser 
scanning microscope, whereas 75% of the GUS transformants produced GUS. GFP could
be visualised readily in swimming zoospores and other developmental stages of P. 
palmivora cells. For high magnification microscopic studies, GFP is better
visualised and was superior to GUS. In contrast, for macroscopic examination, GUS
was superior. Our findings indicate that both GFP and GUS can be used
successfully as reporter genes in P. palmivora.
