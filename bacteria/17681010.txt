This study tests the hypothesis that altering the mineral composition of soil
influences microbial community structure in a nutrient-deficient soil. Microcosms
were established by adding mica (M), basalt (B) and rock phosphate (P) to soil
separately, and in combination (MBP), and by planting with Lolium rigidum,
Trifolium subterraneum or by leaving unplanted. The effects of mineral and plant 
treatments on microbial community structure were assessed using automated
ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis. Bacterial community structure was
significantly affected by both mineral (global R=0.73 and P<0.001) and plant
(global R=0.71 and P<0.001) treatments, as was the fungal community structure:
mineral (global R=0.65 and P<0.001) and plant (global R=0.65 and P<0.001)
treatments. All pairwise comparisons of bacterial and fungal communities between 
different mineral treatments and between different plant treatments were
significantly different (P<0.05). This study has shown that mineral addition to
soil microcosms resulted in substantial changes in both bacterial and fungal
community structure, dependent on the type of mineral added and the plant species
present. These results suggest that the mineral composition of soil may be an
important factor influencing the microbial community structure in soil.
