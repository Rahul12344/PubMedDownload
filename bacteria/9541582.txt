Ceramide generated by lysosomal acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) has been proposed 
to contribute to CD28 co-stimulatory signaling pathways. We used an
aSMase-deficient mouse line (asmase-/-) to elucidate the role of the aSMase in
splenocytes stimulated with either a combination of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
antibodies, the lectin concanavalin A (Con A) or the superantigen staphylococcal 
enterotoxin B. All stimuli were shown to induce IL-2 expression, Con A
additionally triggered the expression of high-affinity IL-2 receptor. However, in
asmase-/- mice secretion of IL-2 was significantly reduced, whereas the
intracellular IL-2 levels were elevated. Proliferation of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or
Con A-stimulated aSMase-deficient splenocytes was reduced up to 50% after 72 h in
comparison to wild-type cells. We conclude that ceramide generated by aSMase is
not involved in CD28 signal transduction, but rather a perturbation of the
secretory system is responsible for the impaired proliferation of
aSMase-deficient splenocytes.
