Although the transcriptional basis for states of unresponsiveness in primary T
cells is unclear, tolerant B lymphocytes exhibit inhibition of both c-Jun
N-terminal kinase induction and IkappaBalpha (inhibitor of NF-kappaBalpha)
degradation, leading to lower levels of both nuclear AP-1 and NF-kappaB.
Expression of an IkappaBalpha mutant resistant to signal-induced degradation in
transgenic T cells caused markedly deficient effector cytokine (IL-4, IFN-gamma) 
production after primary TCR stimulation despite a detectable level of nuclear
NF-kappaB. A TCR response element from the IFN-gamma promoter, despite lacking
detectable NF-kappaB/Rel sites, was also unresponsive to TCR ligation. Nuclear
induction of AP-1 proteins in response to T cell activation was diminished in
transgenic T cells. Costimulation induced by anti-CD28 mAb increased IL-2
production, but failed to reverse the defects in effector cytokine production.
Taken together, these data indicate that impaired NF-kappaB/Rel signaling in T
cells interferes with the signal transduction pathways required for efficient
induction of effector cytokine production.
