A 35 y old woman with severe and progressive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
received high-dose chemotherapy followed by a T cell depleted autologous stem
cell transplantation. Peripheral blood stem cell were mobilised with
Cyclophosphamide 4.5 g/m2 followed by Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor
(G-CSF). A CD34 positive selection provided a 3 log T cell depletion. High-dose
immunosuppression consisted of the BEAM regimen. The purified autograft was
reinfused on day 0. In the post transplant period, hemopoietic growth factors,
G-CSF, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) and
Erythropoietin, were administered, engraftment was rapid. Both the mobilisation
and the transplant procedures were easily performed and well tolerated. One year 
later, the patient is in clinical remission. The ANA and anti-SSA-antibodies were
undetectable at 1 and 6 months after intensification, but reappeared at low
levels at 9 months. Corticosteroid requirement has gradually decreased. In
conclusion, we report here the favourable evolution of a patient with a severe
SLE, who clinically improved with high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and
autologous stem cell transplantation, and showed a 9 month serological remission.
