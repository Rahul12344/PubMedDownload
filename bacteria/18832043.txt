Confinement of the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis to a
membrane-bound vacuole, termed an inclusion, within infected epithelial cells
neither prevents secretion of chlamydial antigens into the host cytosol nor
protects chlamydiae from innate immune detection. However, the details leading to
chlamydial antigen presentation are not clear. By immunoelectron microscopy of
infected endometrial epithelial cells and in isolated cell secretory
compartments, chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP), lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) and the inclusion membrane protein A (IncA) were localized to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and co-localized with multiple ER markers, but not
with markers of the endosomes, lysosomes, Golgi nor mitochondria. Chlamydial LPS 
was also co-localized with CD1d in the ER. Since the chlamydial antigens,
contained in everted inclusion membrane vesicles, were found within the host cell
ER, these data raise additional implications for antigen processing by infected
uterine epithelial cells for classical and non-classical T cell antigen
presentation.
