A mesocosm experiment was conducted to quantify the relationships between the
presence and body size of two burrowing heart urchins (Brissopsis lyrifera and
Echinocardium cordatum) and rates of sediment nutrient flux. Furthermore, the
impact of seawater acidification on these relationships was determined during
this 40-day exposure experiment. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, seawater was
acidified to pHNBS 7.6, 7.2 or 6.8. Control treatments were maintained in natural
seawater (pH≈8.0). Under normocapnic conditions, burrowing urchins were seen to
reduce the sediment uptake of nitrite or nitrate whilst enhancing the release of 
silicate and phosphate. In acidified (hypercapnic) treatments, the biological
control of biogeochemical cycles by urchins was significantly affected, probably 
through the combined impacts of high CO2 on nitrifying bacteria, benthic algae
and urchin behaviour. This study highlights the importance of considering
biological interactions when predicting the consequences of seawater
acidification on ecosystem function.
