In a multicenter open study involving 620 patients suffering from recurrent
infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract aged between 12 and 89 years,
the tolerability of an oral bacterial lysate was investigated. On the basis of
the nature and frequency (1.9%) of adverse effects, and an analysis of the
laboratory investigations over an observation period of three months, overall
tolerability was adjudged to be excellent. The frequency and severity of
infections was reduced. In 75% of the cases, both physician and patient
considered the augmentation of the body's defense mechanisms by immunoactivation 
to have been of benefit. The favourable risk-to-benefit ratio results in a high
level of acceptance of immunotherapy, and 96% of the patients completed the study
as planned.
