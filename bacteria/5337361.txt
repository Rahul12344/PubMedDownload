Anaerobic biodegradation of DDT to DDD in soil.

Guenzi WD, Beard WE.

DDT labeled with carbon-14 was added to soil, and the mixture was incubated
anaerobically for 2 weeks and 4 weeks. DDT and seven possible decomposition
products were separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the radioactivity of
material from individual spots was determined by liquid scintillation. The DDT
was dechlorinated by soil microorganisms to DDD, and only traces of other
degradation products were detected. No degradation of DDT was detected in sterile
soil.
