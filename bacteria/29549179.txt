The functions of human NK cells in defense against pathogens and placental
development during reproduction are modulated by interactions of killer cell
Ig-like receptors (KIRs) with HLA-A, -B and -C class I ligands. Both receptors
and ligands are highly polymorphic and exhibit extensive differences between
human populations. Indigenous to southern Africa are the KhoeSan, the most
ancient group of modern human populations, who have highest genomic diversity
worldwide. We studied two KhoeSan populations, the Nama pastoralists and the
≠Khomani San hunter-gatherers. Comprehensive next-generation sequence analysis of
HLA-A, -B, and -C and all KIR genes identified 248 different KIR and 137 HLA
class I, which assort into ∼200 haplotypes for each gene family. All 74 Nama and 
78 ≠Khomani San studied have different genotypes. Numerous novel KIR alleles were
identified, including three arising by intergenic recombination. On average,
KhoeSan individuals have seven to eight pairs of interacting KIR and HLA class I 
ligands, the highest diversity and divergence of polymorphic NK cell receptors
and ligands observed to date. In this context of high genetic diversity, both the
Nama and the ≠Khomani San have an unusually conserved, centromeric KIR haplotype 
that has arisen to high frequency and is different in the two KhoeSan
populations. Distinguishing these haplotypes are independent mutations in
KIR2DL1, which both prevent KIR2DL1 from functioning as an inhibitory receptor
for C2+ HLA-C. The relatively high frequency of C2+ HLA-C in the Nama and the
≠Khomani San appears to have led to natural selection against strong inhibitory
C2-specific KIR.
