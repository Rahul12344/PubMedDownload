The BCR-ABL1 fusion gene generating an oncogenic tyrosine kinase is a hallmark of
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which can be successfully targeted by BCR-ABL1
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, treatment-free remission has been
achieved in a minority of patients due to evolving TKI resistance and
intolerance. Primary or acquired resistance to the approved TKIs and progression 
to blast crisis (BC), thus, remain a major clinical challenge that requires
alternative therapeutic strategies. Here, we first demonstrate that donor natural
killer (NK) cells prepared using a protocol adopted in clinical trials can
efficiently eliminate CML-BC blasts, with TKI resistance regardless of BCR-ABL1
mutations, and preferentially target CD34+CD38- leukemic stem cells (LSC), a
potential source of disease relapse. Mechanistically, the predominant expression 
of PVR, a ligand for the NK cell-activating DNAM-1 receptor, in concert with
ICAM-1, a ligand for NK cell adhesion, confer this susceptibility to NK cells,
despite the lack of ligands for NKG2D, a principal NK cell activating receptor,
as an immune evasion mechanism. With these mechanistic insights, our findings
provide a proof-of-concept that donor NK cell-based therapy is a viable strategy 
for overcoming TKI resistance in CML, particularly the advanced,
multi-TKI-resistant CML with dismal outcome.
