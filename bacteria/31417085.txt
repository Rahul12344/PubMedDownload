Modification with SUMO regulates many eukaryotic proteins. Down-regulation of
sumoylated forms of proteins involves either their desumoylation, and hence
recycling of the unmodified form, or their proteolytic targeting by ubiquitin
ligases that recognize their SUMO modification (termed STUbL or ULS). STUbL
enzymes such as Uls1 and Slx5-Slx8 in budding yeast or RNF4 and Arkadia/RNF111 in
humans bear multiple SUMO interaction motifs to recognize substrates carrying
poly-SUMO chains. Using yeast as experimental system and isothermal titration
calorimetry, we here show that Arkadia specifically selects substrates carrying
SUMO1-capped SUMO2/3 hybrid conjugates and targets them for proteasomal
degradation. Our data suggest that a SUMO1-specific binding site in Arkadia with 
sequence similarity to a SUMO1-binding site in DPP9 is required for targeting
endogenous hybrid SUMO conjugates and PML nuclear bodies in human cells. We thus 
characterize Arkadia as a STUbL with a preference for substrate proteins marked
with distinct hybrid SUMO chains.
