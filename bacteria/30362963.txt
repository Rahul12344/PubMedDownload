Mesenchymal stem cells have emerged as an important tool that can be used for
tissue regeneration thanks to their easy preparation, differentiation potential
and immunomodulatory activity. However, an extensive culture of stem cells in
vitro prior to clinical use can lead to oxidative stress that can modulate
different stem cells properties, such as self-renewal, proliferation,
differentiation and senescence. The aim of this study was to investigate the
aging process occurring during in vitro expansion of stem cells, obtained from
amniotic fluids (AFSC) at similar gestational age.The analysis of 21 AFSC samples
allowed to classify them in groups with different levels of stemness properties. 
In summary, the expression of pluripotency genes and the proliferation rate were 
inversely correlated with the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA
damage signs and the onset premature aging markers, including accumulation of
prelamin A, the lamin A immature form. Interestingly, a specific source of ROS,
the NADPH oxidase isoform 4 (Nox4), can localize into PML nuclear bodies
(PML-NB), where it associates to prelamin A. Besides, Nox4 post translational
modification, involved in PML-NB localization, is linked to its degradation
pathway, as it is also for prelamin A, thus possibly modulating the premature
aging phenotype occurrence.
