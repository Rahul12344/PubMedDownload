OBJECTIVES: To describe the bacterial and fungal microbiota of the conjunctiva
and factors influencing these microbiota of healthy cats. To evaluate the
antimicrobial resistance profile and discuss the use of appropriate antimicrobial
drugs.
ANIMALS STUDIED: One hundred and twenty healthy cats PROCEDURES: Conjunctival
samples with dry or premoistened swabs were obtained from both eyes and cultured 
for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi. In vitro bacterial, susceptibility 
testing was performed. The effects of age, sex, breed, season, living
environment, and sample collection technique on the frequency and composition of 
microbial isolation were evaluated.
RESULTS: In 49 of 120 cats (40.8%) and 73 of 240 swabs (30.4%), microorganisms
were isolated. Of the isolates, 71% (61/86) were Gram-positive bacteria, 26%
(22/86) were Gram-negative bacteria, and 3% (3/86) were fungi. Staphylococcus
felis (17/86; 19.8%) was the most commonly isolated species. Moraxella osloensis 
(5/86; 5.8%) was the most frequent Gram-negative species. The season had a
statistically significant influence (P = 0.04) on the frequency of isolation. The
use of premoistened swabs increased the rate of Gram-positive bacterial detection
significantly (P = 0.03). The in vitro susceptibility testing showed high
efficacy of chloramphenicol, gentamicin, pradofloxacin, and enrofloxacin.
CONCLUSIONS: The isolated microbiota aligns with previous studies performed in
other countries, although the microbiota of cats in the present study showed
wider bacterial diversity, and more Gram-negative species were isolated. Swab
sampling should be performed with premoistened swabs. The topical antimicrobials 
gentamicin and chloramphenicol are suitable therapeutics for first-line
treatment.
