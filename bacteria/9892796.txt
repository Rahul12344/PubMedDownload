BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Inoculation of Helicobacter felis into the murine stomach
has been reported to induce chronic gastric inflammation and may be a model of
Helicobacter pylori-induced chronic gastritis. In this study, to characterize H. 
felis-induced gastritis, the gastric production of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)
and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was measured in mice.
METHODS: Gastric mucosal lesions were induced in H. felis-infected BALB/c mice by
water-immersion stress. The severity score of gastric erosions per stomach was
measured as the sum of the length of erosions. Gene expression of IL-1beta and
HGF were analyzed by Northern blot analysis and production of HGF was examined
using the enzyme immunoassay method.
RESULTS: Water-immersion stress induced gastric mucosal lesions accompanied by
increased expression of IL-1beta mRNA. H. felis infection evoked enhanced
expression of IL-1beta and HGF genes. When H. felis-infected mice were stressed
by water immersion, the mucosal lesions were more severe than those in
non-infected mice. Moreover, IL-1beta gene expression as well as HGF production
was further increased.
CONCLUSIONS: Although H. felis inoculation did not cause gastric mucosal erosions
by itself, it augmented the stress-induced erosions.
