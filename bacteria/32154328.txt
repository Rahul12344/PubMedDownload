Sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia are caused by structural abnormality 
or inadequate production of adult hemoglobin (HbA, α2β2), respectively.
Individuals with either disorder are asymptomatic before birth because fetal
hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) is unaffected. Thus, reversal of the switch from HbF to
HbA could reduce or even prevent symptoms these disorders. In this study, we show
that insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is one factor 
that could accomplish this goal. IGF2BP1 is a fetal factor that undergoes a
transcriptional switch consistent with the transition from HbF to HbA. Lentivirus
delivery of IGF2BP1 to CD34+ cells of healthy adult donors reversed hemoglobin
production toward the fetal type in culture-differentiated erythroid cells.
Analogous studies using patient-derived CD34+ cells revealed that
IGF2BP1-dependent HbF induction could ameliorate the chain imbalance in
β-thalassemia or potently suppress expression of sickle β-globin in SCD. In all
cases, fetal γ-globin mRNA increased and adult β-globin decreased due, in part,
to formation of contacts between the locus control region (LCR) and γ-globin
genes. We conclude that expression of IGF2BP1 in adult erythroid cells has the
potential to maximize HbF expression in patients with severe β-hemoglobin
disorders by reversing the developmental γ- to β-globin switch.
