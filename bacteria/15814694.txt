Va14Ja18 natural T (iNKT) cells are innate, immunoregulatory lymphocytes that
recognize CD1d-restricted lipid Ags such as alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha
GalCer). The immunoregulatory functions of iNKT cells are dependent upon either
IFN-gamma or IL-4 production by these cells. We hypothesized that alpha GalCer
presentation by different CD1d-positive cell types elicits distinct iNKT cell
functions. In this study we report that dendritic cells (DC) play a critical role
in alpha GalCer-mediated activation of iNKT cells and subsequent transactivation 
of NK cells. Remarkably, B lymphocytes suppress DC-mediated iNKT and NK cell
activation. Nevertheless, alpha GalCer presentation by B cells elicits low IL-4
responses from iNKT cells. This finding is particularly interesting because we
demonstrate that NOD DC are defective in eliciting iNKT cell function, but their 
B cells preferentially activate this T cell subset to secrete low levels of IL-4.
Thus, the differential immune outcome based on the type of APC that displays
glycolipid Ags in vivo has implications for the design of therapies that harness 
the immunoregulatory functions of iNKT cells.
