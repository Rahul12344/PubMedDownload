In Nepal, Plasmodium vivax accounts for approximately 80-90% of the malaria
cases, but limited studies have been conducted on the genetic diversity of this
parasite population. This study was carried out to determine the genetic
diversity of P. vivax population sampled from subjects living in an endemic area 
of Jhapa District by analyzing the polymorphic merozoite surface protein-3alpha
(Pvmsp-3alpha) gene by using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Three 
distinct genotypes were obtained from 96 samples; type A: 40 (71%), type B: 7
(13%), and type C: 9 (16%) which could be categorized into 13 allelic patterns:
A1-A9, B1, B2, C1 and C2. These results indicated a high genetic diversity within
the studied P. vivax population. As the transmission rate of malaria is low in
Nepal, the diversity is most likely due to migration of people between the
malaria endemic regions, either within the country or between Nepal and India.
Similar prevalence of the three genotypes of Pvmsp-3alpha between the two
countries likely supports the latter explanation.
