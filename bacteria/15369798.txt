Survivin expression and Ras activation are regulated by hematopoietic growth
factors. We investigated whether activated Ras could circumvent growth
factor-regulated Survivin expression and if a Ras/Survivin axis mediates growth
factor independent survival and proliferation in hematopoietic cells. Survivin
expression is up-regulated by IL-3 in Ba/F3 and CD34+ cells and inhibited by the 
Ras inhibitor, farnesylthiosalicylic acid. Over-expression of constitutively
activated H-Ras (CA-Ras) in Ba/F3 cells blocked down-modulation of Survivin
expression, G0/G1 arrest, and apoptosis induced by IL-3 withdrawal, while
dominant-negative (DN) H-Ras down-regulated Survivin. Survivin disruption by DN
T34A Survivin blocked CA-Ras-induced IL-3-independent cell survival and
proliferation; however, it did not affect CA-Ras-mediated enhancement of S-phase,
indicating that the anti-apoptotic activity of CA-Ras is Survivin dependent while
its S-phase enhancing effect is not. These results indicate that CA-Ras modulates
Survivin expression independent of hematopoietic growth factors and that a
CA-Ras/Survivin axis regulates survival and proliferation of transformed
hematopoietic cells.
