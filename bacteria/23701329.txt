Increasing antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae,
presents a global medical challenge. No new antibiotics will be available for
these 'superbugs' in the near future due to the dry antibiotic discovery
pipeline. Colistin and polymyxin B are increasingly used as the last-line
therapeutic options for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant
Gram-negative bacteria. This article surveys the significant progress over the
last decade in understanding polymyxin chemistry, mechanisms of antibacterial
activity and resistance, structure-activity relationships and
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. In the 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' era, we must
pursue structure-activity relationship-based approaches to develop novel
polymyxin-like lipopeptides targeting polymyxin-resistant Gram-negative
'superbugs'. Before new antibiotics become available, we must optimize the
clinical use of polymyxins through the application of
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, thereby minimizing the development of
resistance.
