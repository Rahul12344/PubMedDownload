The pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is reviewed, focusing on an
overview of the physiologic mechanisms that regulate mucus transport. A major
emphasis is placed on the active transport systems that regulate the airway
surface liquid (ASL) volume and, particularly, regulate the volume of the
periciliary liquid (PCL) layer. A sequence is developed for CF whereby there is a
depletion of the PCL that reflects the combined dysfunctions of accelerated
Na(+)-dependent volume absorption and failure to secrete Cl(-). Both dysfunctions
are a direct consequence of missing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) at the apical membrane of airway epithelial cells. PCL depletion
leads to failure of mucus transport, which is associated with persistent mucin
secretion and formation of adherent mucus plaques and plugs. These plugs become
the nidus for persistent bacterial airway infections that ultimately lead to a
markedly anaerobic luminal environment.
