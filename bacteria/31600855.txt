Planctomycetes are ubiquitous and environmentally important Gram-negative aquatic
bacteria with key roles in global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Many planctomycetal
species have a pink or orange colour and have been suggested to produce
carotenoids. Potential applications as food colorants or anti-oxidants have been 
proposed. Hitherto, the planctomycetal metabolism is largely unexplored and the
strain pigmentation has not been explored. For a holistic view of the complex
planctomycetal physiology, we analysed carotenoid profiles of the pink-pigmented 
strain Rhodopirellula rubra LF2T and of the orange strain Rubinisphaera
brasiliensis Gr7. During LC-MS/MS analysis of culture extracts, we could identify
three saproxanthin-type carotenoids including a rare C45 carotenoid. These
compounds, saproxanthin, dehydroflexixanthin and
2'-isopentenyldehydrosaproxanthin, derive from the common carotenoid precursor
lycopene and are characterized by related end groups, namely a 3-hydroxylated
β-carotene-like cyclohexene ring as one end group and simple hydration on the
other end of the molecule. Based on the observed molecule structure we present
putative pathways for their biosynthesis. Results support Planctomycetes as a
promising, yet mostly untapped source of carotenoids.
