Anemarrhena asphodeloides is an herb widely used to treat symptoms associated
with diabetes in traditional Chinese medicine. However, its key components and
metabolites have low bioavailability and poor host absorption. To clarify the
anti-diabetic mechanism of A. asphodeloides extract (AAE), we examined the
anti-diabetic effects of AAE in rats with diabetes induced by a high-fat diet and
streptozotocin. Faeces levels of the main components and metabolites of AAE were 
significantly higher than levels in plasma, which indicated that gut microbiota
might play important roles in its anti-diabetic effect. Microbiological studies
showed that unabsorbed components increased the diversity of the gut microbiota, 
enriched potentially beneficial bacteria, and suppressed potentially harmful
bacteria. In vitro studies showed that AAE promoted the proliferation of Blautia 
coccoides, a bacterium with positive implication for diabetes, in a
dose-dependent manner. AAE also promoted pancreatic cell regeneration and
restored the function of pancreatic islet cells via peroxiredoxin 4
overexpression. Overall, these results suggest that AAE alleviates diabetes via
modulating gut microbiota and protein expression.
