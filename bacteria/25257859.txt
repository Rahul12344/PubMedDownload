CD4(+) T cell effectors are crucial for establishing antitumor immunity.
Dendritic cell maturation by immune adjuvants appears to facilitate
subset-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation, but the adjuvant effect for CD4 T on
induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) is largely unknown. Self-antigenic
determinants with low avidity are usually CD4 epitopes in mutated proteins with
tumor-associated class I-antigens (TAAs). In this study, we made a chimeric
version of survivin, a target of human CTLs. The chimeric survivin, where human
survivin-2B containing a TAA was embedded in the mouse survivin frame (MmSVN2B), 
was used to immunize HLA-A-2402/K(b)-transgenic (HLA24(b)-Tg) mice. Subcutaneous 
administration of MmSVN2B or xenogeneic human survivin (control HsSNV2B) to
HLA24(b)-Tg mice failed to induce an immune response without co-administration of
an RNA adjuvant polyI:C, which was required for effector induction in vivo.
Although HLA-A-2402/K(b) presented the survivin-2B peptide in C57BL/6 mice,
2B-specific tetramer assays showed that no CD8(+) T CTLs specific to survivin-2B 
proliferated above the detection limit in immunized mice, even with polyI:C
treatment. However, the CD4(+) T cell response, as monitored by IFN-γ, was
significantly increased in mice given polyI:C+MmSVN2B. The Th1 response and
antibody production were enhanced in the mice with polyI:C. The CD4 epitope
responsible for effector function was not Hs/MmSNV13-27, a nonconserved region
between human and mouse survivin, but region 53-67, which was identical between
human and mouse survivin. These results suggest that activated, self-reactive
CD4(+) helper T cells proliferate in MmSVN2B+polyI:C immunization and contribute 
to Th1 polarization followed by antibody production, but hardly participate in
CTL induction.
