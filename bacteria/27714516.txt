A series of amino acid substitutions was made in a previously identified
Î²-tubulin-derived GRK2 substrate peptide (404DEMEFTEAESNMN416) to examine the
role of amino acid residues surrounding the phosphorylation site. Anionic amino
acid residues surrounding the phosphorylation site played an important role in
the affinity for GRK2. Compared to the original peptide, a modified peptide
(Ac-EEMEFSEAEANMN-NH2) exhibited markedly higher affinity for GRK2, but very low 
affinity for GRK5, suggesting that it can be a sensitive and selective peptide
for GRK2.
