The aim of this work was to characterize a leucocyte-differentiation antigen or
chemokine receptor that allows the identification of type 1 (T helper 1 (Th1),
Tc1) and type 2 (Th2, Tc2) lymphocytes in short-term-cultured human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells. In addition, we assessed the type of response induced by
mycobacterial antigens in tuberculosis patients and healthy contacts. Cells were 
stimulated with an unfractionated culture filtrate or 30 kDa antigen from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Then, CD4 and CD8 cell labelling was combined with
CD30, CD27, CD28, CD45RA or CD45R0 staining, detection of intracellular
interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) and analysis by three-colour
flow cytometry. In separate experiments, the expression of different chemokine
receptors (CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR3 and CXCR4) was also studied. We found that
none of the cell-surface molecules studied was preferentially expressed by Th1 or
Th2 cells. Thus, our results indicate that these lymphocyte subsets cannot be
identified in short-term-cultured mononuclear cells on the basis of preferential 
expression of the cell markers studied, and that it is necessary to look for
additional molecules that allow the discrimination of Th1 and Th2 cells.
