An aerobic dieldrin-degrading fungus, Mucor racemosus strain DDF, was isolated
from a soil to which endosulfan had been annually applied for more than 10 years 
until 2008. Strain DDF degraded dieldrin to 1.01 microM from 14.3 microM during a
10-day incubation at 25 degrees C. Approximately 0.15 microM (9%) of aldrin
trans-diol was generated from the dieldrin degradation after a 1-day incubation. 
The degradation of dieldrin by strain DDF was detected over a broad range of pH
and concentrations of glucose and nitrogen sources. Extracellular fluid without
mycelia also degraded dieldrin. Strain DDF degraded not only dieldrin but also
heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, DDT, and DDE.
Endosulfan sulfate and heptachlor were degraded by 0.64 microM (95%) and 0.75
microM (94%), respectively, whereas endosulfan and DDE were degraded by 2.42
microM (80%) and 3.29 microM (79%), respectively, and DDT and heptachlor epoxide 
were degraded by 6.95 microM (49.3%) and 5.36 microM (67.5%), respectively,
compared with the control, which had a concentration of approximately 14 microM. 
These results suggest that strain DDF could be a candidate for the bioremediation
of sites contaminated with various persistent organochlorine pesticides including
POPs.
