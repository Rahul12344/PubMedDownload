RimO and MiaB are radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzymes that catalyze the
attachment of methylthio (-SCH3) groups to macromolecular substrates. RimO
attaches a methylthio group at C3 of aspartate 89 of protein S12, a component of 
the 30S subunit of the bacterial ribosome. MiaB attaches a methylthio group at C2
of N(6)-(isopentenyl)adenosine, found at nucleotide 37 in several prokaryotic
tRNAs. These two enzymes are prototypical members of a subclass of radical SAM
enzymes called methylthiotransferases (MTTases). It had been assumed that the
sequence of steps in MTTase reactions involves initial sulfur insertion into the 
organic substrate followed by capping of the inserted sulfur atom with a
SAM-derived methyl group. In this work, however, we show that both RimO and MiaB 
from Thermotoga maritima catalyze methyl transfer from SAM to an acid/base labile
acceptor on the protein in the absence of their respective macromolecular
substrates. Consistent with the assignment of the acceptor as an iron-sulfur
cluster, denaturation of the SAM-treated protein with acid results in production 
of methanethiol. When RimO or MiaB is first incubated with SAM in the absence of 
substrate and reductant and then incubated with excess
S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-d3]methionine in the presence of substrate and reductant,
production of the unlabeled product precedes production of the deuterated
product, showing that the methylated species is chemically and kinetically
competent to be an intermediate.
