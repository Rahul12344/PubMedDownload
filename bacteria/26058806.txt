MAGEA10, a cancer/testis antigens expressed in tumors but not in normal tissues
with the exception of testis and placenta, represents an attractive target for
cancer immunotherapy. However, suppressive cytoenvironment and requirement of
specific HLA-alleles presentation frequently led to immunotherapy failure. In
this study MAGEA10 was scarcely expressed in cancer patients, but enhanced by
viili polysaccharides, which indicates a possibility of increasing epitopes
presentation. Furthermore the correlation of gene expression with methylation,
indicated by R(2) value for MAGEA10 that was 3 times higher than the value for
other MAGE genes tested, provides an explanation of why MAGEA10 was highly
inhibited, this is also seen by Kaplan-Meier analysis because MAGEA10 did not
change the patients' lifespan. By using Molecular-Docking method, 3 MAGEA10
peptides were found binding to the groove position of HLA-A(∗)0210 as same as
MAGEA4 peptide co-crystallized with HLA-A(∗)0210, which indicates that they could
be promising for HLA-A(∗)0201 presentation in immunotherapy.
