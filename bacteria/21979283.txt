AIM: to validate isolation and cultivation methods of bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells (BM-MSCs) from iliac crest, and to compare biological characteristics 
of BM-MSCs from different age groups for preparation of autologous stem cell
therapy in cartilage defect.
METHODS: patients undergoing spinal surgery were selected and grouped according
to age. Iliac crest bone marrow from the patients was aspirated. BM-MSCs were
isolated from the bone marrow and then cultivated. Their biological
characteristics including morphological appearances and surface biomarkers were
evaluated. Growth curves were observed. Sterility and Mycoplasma tests were also 
performed for quality assessment of BM-MSCs culture procedure.
RESULTS: in average, cultivated-BM-MSCs reached the number of 7.56-22.95 x 106 in
4-7 weeks period. BM-MSCs of all age groups showed the same quality of
morphology, shape and surface biomarkers (CD105+, CD73+, CD34-, CD45-, CD14-,
CD19-, HLA-DR-).
CONCLUSION: our procedures in isolating and cultivating of BM-MSCs have reached
required amount for implantation into the cartilage lesion. In addition, the
cultivated-BM-MSCs' biological characteristics were also in accordance with
International Society of Cell Therapy (ISCT) MSCs criteria.
