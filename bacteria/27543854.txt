Astragaloside IV (AS-IV), an active saponin purified from Astragali Radix, has
been identified with broad biological and pharmacological activities. In the
present study, we continue to explore the potential effect of AS-IV on
antibacterial response using an acute E. coli peritoneal infection model. Our
findings implied that administration of AS-IV decreases mortality in mice
challenged by lethal E. coli infection. The protection of AS-IV was related to
promotion of neutrophil extravasation into the peritoneum and bacterial
clearance. Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation in neutrophils has been reported
to reduce CXCR2 expression and subsequent neutrophil migration. Our data
indicated that AS-IV prevented the reduction of CXCR2 expression and neutrophil
migration induced by LPS, the activator for TLR4. Moreover, we found that AS-IV
blocks LPS-induced suppression of CXCR2 on neutrophils by inhibiting the
expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2), an agonist that
regulates desensitization and internalization of chemokine receptors. Taken
together, these data propose that AS-IV, through modulating GRK2-CXCR2 signal in 
neutrophils, offers an essential efficacy on host antibacterial immunity.
