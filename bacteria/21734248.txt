Pneumococcal meningitis continues to be associated with high rates of mortality
and long-term neurological sequelae. The most common route of infection starts by
nasopharyngeal colonization by Streptococcus pneumoniae, which must avoid mucosal
entrapment and evade the host immune system after local activation. During
invasive disease, pneumococcal epithelial adhesion is followed by bloodstream
invasion and activation of the complement and coagulation systems. The release of
inflammatory mediators facilitates pneumococcal crossing of the blood-brain
barrier into the brain, where the bacteria multiply freely and trigger activation
of circulating antigen-presenting cells and resident microglial cells. The
resulting massive inflammation leads to further neutrophil recruitment and
inflammation, resulting in the well-known features of bacterial meningitis,
including cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, cochlear damage, cerebral edema,
hydrocephalus, and cerebrovascular complications. Experimental animal models
continue to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of pneumococcal
meningitis and provide the platform for the development of new adjuvant
treatments and antimicrobial therapy. This review discusses the most recent views
on the pathophysiology of pneumococcal meningitis, as well as potential targets
for (adjunctive) therapy.
