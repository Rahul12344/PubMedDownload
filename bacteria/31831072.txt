BACKGROUND: To develop a mathematical model to estimate daily evolution of
disease severity using routinely available parameters in patients admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU).
METHODS: Over a 3-year period, we prospectively enrolled consecutive adults with 
sepsis and categorized patients as (1) being at risk for developing (more severe)
organ dysfunction, (2) having (potentially still reversible) limited organ
failure, or (3) having multiple-organ failure. Daily probabilities for
transitions between these disease states, and to death or discharge, during the
first 2 weeks in ICU were calculated using a multi-state model that was updated
every 2 days using both baseline and time-varying information. The model was
validated in independent patients.
RESULTS: We studied 1371 sepsis admissions in 1251 patients. Upon presentation,
53 (4%) were classed at risk, 1151 (84%) had limited organ failure, and 167 (12%)
had multiple-organ failure. Among patients with limited organ failure, 197 (17%) 
evolved to multiple-organ failure or died and 809 (70%) improved or were
discharged alive within 14 days. Among patients with multiple-organ failure, 67
(40%) died and 91 (54%) improved or were discharged. Treatment response could be 
predicted with reasonable accuracy (c-statistic ranging from 0.55 to 0.81 for
individual disease states, and 0.67 overall). Model performance in the validation
cohort was similar.
CONCLUSIONS: This prediction model that estimates daily evolution of disease
severity during sepsis may eventually support clinicians in making better
informed treatment decisions and could be used to evaluate prognostic biomarkers 
or perform in silico modeling of novel sepsis therapies during trial design.
