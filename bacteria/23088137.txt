The antibacterial activity of synthetic peptides of the active site of GM-CSF and
supernatants of CD34+45- hematopoietic progenitor cells has been investigated
GM-CSF peptides and cell supernatants were found to possess pronounced
antibacterial activity, at that a combination of these substances has a more
pronounced activity in comparison with the single substances. Possible mechanisms
of the identified effects of synthetic peptides and substances from the
supernatants of CD34+5- cells are discussed.
