Compounds possessing benzimidazole system exhibit significant antituberculous
activity. In order to examine how structure modifications affect tuberculostatic 
activity, a series of benzazole derivatives were synthesized and screened for
their antitubercular activity. The compounds 1⁻20 were obtained by the reaction
between o-diamine, o-aminophenol, or o-aminothiophenol with carboxylic acids or
thioamides. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, ¹H-NMR,
13C-NMR spectra, and elemental analysis. Synthesized benzazoles were evaluated
for their tuberculostatic activity toward Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.
Quantum chemical calculations were performed to study the molecular geometry and 
the electronic structure of benzimidazoles GK-151B, 4, 6, and benzoxazole 11,
using the Gaussian 03W software (Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford, CT, USA).
Three-dimensional structure of benzimidazoles 1⁻3, MC-9, and GK-151B was
determined by ab initio calculation using Gamess-US software. The activity of the
received benzimidazoles was moderate or good. All of the benzoxazoles and
benzothiazoles demonstrated much lower activity. Benzoxazoles were less active by
about 50 times, and benzothiazole by 100 times than the benzimidazole analogs.
Quantum chemical calculations showed differences in the distribution of
electrostatic potential in the benzazole system of benzimidazoles and
benzoxazoles. Three-dimensional structure calculations revealed how the parity of
the alkyl substituent at the C2 position impacts the activity. Benzimidazole
system is essential for the antituberculosis activity that is associated with the
presence of the imine nitrogen atom in N-1 position. Its replacement by an oxygen
or sulfur atom results in a decrease of the activity. The parity of the alkyl
substituent at the C-2 position also modifies the activity.
