OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: Genetic predisposition of the inflammatory host response 
may affect the development of stroke. On the basis of the theory of infectious
burden and risk of stroke, we considered it of interest to investigate the
relevance of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DEFB1 gene and the
copy number variant (CNV) of the DEFB4 genes in ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the genotype frequencies of the
three SNPs of the DEFB1 gene between the patients with stroke (n = 312) and the
healthy blood donors (n = 221). However, a higher frequency of a lower (<4) copy 
number of the DEFB4 gene was observed in the patients with ischemic stroke as
compared with the healthy controls (40% vs 24%, respectively). Additionally, low 
plasma concentrations of hBD-2 (187 ± 20 pg/ml) were characteristic of the
patients with fewer than four copy numbers relative to those with more than four 
copy numbers (385 ± 35 pg/ml).
CONCLUSIONS: The low copy number of the DEFB4 gene, involving a weakened
antimicrobial defense of the host, might be important in the pathogenesis of
stroke.
