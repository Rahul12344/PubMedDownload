Flavonoids and other polyphenolic compounds have powerful antioxidant effects in 
vitro in many test systems, but can act as pro-oxidants in some others. Whether
pro-oxidant, antioxidant, or any of the many other biological effects potentially
exerted by flavonoids account for or contribute to the health benefits of diets
rich in plant-derived foods and beverages is uncertain. Phenolic compounds may
help to protect the gastrointestinal tract against damage by reactive species
present in foods or generated within the stomach and intestines. The overall
health benefit of flavonoids is uncertain, and consumption of large quantities of
them in fortified foods or supplements should not yet be encouraged.
