Organ-specific homing of lymphoid cells depends on the expression of
tissue-specific adhesion molecules and production of specific chemokines. CCL25
(TECK) and CCL28 (MEC) have been reported to direct circulating memory/effector B
cells to mucosal tissues. Here, we examined if differential responsiveness to
mucosal and systemic chemokines could explain the differential migration pattern 
of circulating human antibody-secreting cells (ASC), induced by mucosal and
systemic immunization. There was a robust migration of specific IgA- and IgM-ASC 
induced by Salmonella vaccination toward the mucosal chemokines CCL25 and CCL28. 
In contrast, tetanus-specific ASC migrated to the systemic chemokine CXCL12
(SDF-1alpha) and showed no response to CCL25 or CCL28, not even tetanus-specific 
IgA-ASC. Cell sorting experiments demonstrated that Salmonella-specific ASC
co-expressed CCR9 and CCR10. Our results show that induction site, rather than
isotype commitment, determines the chemokine responsiveness and migration pattern
of human effector B cells.
