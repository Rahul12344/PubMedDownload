MHC class I molecules bind only those peptides with high affinity that conform to
stringent length and sequence requirements. We have now investigated which
peptides can aid the in vitro folding of class I molecules, and we find that the 
dipeptide glycyl-leucine efficiently supports the folding of HLA-A*02:01 and
H-2K(b) into a peptide-receptive conformation that rapidly binds high-affinity
peptides. Treatment of cells with glycyl-leucine induces accumulation of
peptide-receptive H-2K(b) and HLA-A*02:01 at the surface of cells. Other
dipeptides with a hydrophobic second amino acid show similar enhancement effects.
Our data suggest that the dipeptides bind into the F pocket like the C-terminal
amino acids of a high-affinity peptide.
