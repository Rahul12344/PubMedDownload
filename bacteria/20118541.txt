Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid mediator that is known to exhibit
chemotactic activity toward a variety of cancer cells. However, its effect on the
immune system has not been studied extensively. Another lipid mediator,
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), has been shown to influence lymphocyte
recirculation by regulating lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs. In this
study, we found that LPA inhibits spontaneous migration of mouse splenic
lymphocytes through a chemorepulsive effect. We also demonstrated that LPA
inhibits chemokine CCL21-induced lymphocyte migration. This inhibitory effect on 
CCL21-induced migration was observed for both T and B cells. The involvement of a
receptor, LPA(1), LPA(2) or LPA(3), in the inhibition of the CCL21-induced
migration was confirmed with a synthetic agonist, oleyl thiophosphate.
Considering that the signaling by CCL21 through cognate receptor CCR7 contributes
to lymphocyte homing and dendritic cell trafficking to lymph nodes, LPA may play 
a role as a key regulator of these processes. The inhibitory effect of LPA is in 
remarkable contrast to the effect of S1P receptor signaling, which is known to
potentiate lymphocyte chemotaxis involving CCR7.
