Cortical thymocytes express a very low level of HLA class I Ag on their cell
surface. As these cells mature to medullary thymocytes and peripheral T cells,
HLA class I expression increases to a high level. Leukemic T cell lines arrested 
at various stages of development were used to examine the regulation of HLA class
I expression. Nuclear runoff analysis demonstrated that expression differences in
these cell lines were the result of a difference in transcription rates.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with the upstream regulatory region of
HLA-A2 as a probe for HLA class I-specific DNA binding proteins indicated that
DNA binding activity in the cell extracts paralleled the transcriptional activity
of the cells. The predominant DNA binding activity in these T cell lines was
mapped, by DNase I protection analysis, to a conserved inverted repeat of the MHC
class I enhancer. Thus HLA class I expression in these stage-specific T cell
lines correlates with the amount of this enhancer binding activity in these cells
suggesting that this commonly found DNA binding factor may, in this system, act
to regulate HLA class I expression in a very specific manner.
