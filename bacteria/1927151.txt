Twelve freshly lactating ewes were experimentally infected with 2 Mycoplasma (M.)
bovis strains via the teat canal in the left udder. The M. bovis infection
produced a febrile clinical mastitis in all infected animals. M. bovis could be
re-isolated regularly from the experimentally infected udder halves and the
infection spread to the other halves. Some contact animals and 4 suckling lambs
became naturally infected. Antibody titres were detected by means of the indirect
hemagglutination test in blood sera 2 to 3 weeks post infectionem. The
pathological lesions were similar to those of the M. bovis mastitis of cows. By
the end of the trial the ewes had recovered from the clinical mastitis.
