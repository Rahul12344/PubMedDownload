Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas are highly malignant cancers characterized by
extensive invasion into surrounding tissues, metastasis to distant organs, and a 
limited response to therapy. A main feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas 
is desmoplasia, which leads to extensive deposition of collagen I. We have
demonstrated that collagen I can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in pancreatic cancer cells. A hallmark of EMT is an increase in the expression of
the mesenchymal cadherin N-cadherin. Previously we showed up-regulation of
N-cadherin promotes tumor cell invasion and that collagen I-induced EMT is
mediated by two collagen receptors, α2β1-integrin and discoidin domain receptor 1
(DDR1). DDR1 is a receptor-tyrosine kinase widely expressed during embryonic
development and in many adult tissues and is also highly expressed in many
different cancers. In the signaling pathway initiated by collagen, we have shown 
proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is downstream of DDR1. In this study we
found isoform b of DDR1 is responsible for collagen I-induced up-regulation of
N-cadherin and tyrosine 513 of DDR1b is necessary. Knocking down Shc1, which
binds to tyrosine 513 of DDR1b via its PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain,
eliminates the up-regulation of N-cadherin. The signaling does not require a
functional SH2 domain or the tyrosine residues commonly phosphorylated in Shc1
but is mediated by the interaction between a short segment of the central domain 
of Shc1 and the proline-rich region of Pyk2. Taken together, these data
illustrate DDR1b, but not DDR1a, mediates collagen I-induced N-cadherin
up-regulation, and Shc1 is involved in this process by coupling to both DDR1 and 
Pyk2.
