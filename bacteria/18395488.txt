Cystic fibrosis is the most common, inherited fatal disease in Caucasians. The
major cause of morbidity and mortality is chronic lung disease due to infection
and inflammation in the airways leading to bronchiectasis and respiratory
failure. The signature pathologic features of CF lung disease including abnormal 
mucus obstructing airways, chronic infection with Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram negative bacteria, and a robust
neutrophil-dominant airway inflammation, are exacerbated by unopposed proteases
present at high concentrations in the ASL. There is strong evidence that
proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase, contribute to the pathology of CF by
impairing mucociliary clearance, interfering with innate immune functions, and
perpetuating neutrophilic inflammation. The mechanisms employed by proteases to
impact airway function in CF will be reviewed.
