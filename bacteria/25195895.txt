The cell-surface receptor Tar mediates bacterial chemotaxis toward an attractant,
aspartate (Asp), and away from a repellent, Ni(2+). To understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying the induction of Tar activity by its ligands, the
Escherichia coli Tar periplasmic domain with and without bound aspartate (Asp-Tar
and apo-Tar, respectively) were each crystallized in two different forms. Using
ammonium sulfate as a precipitant, crystals of apo-Tar1 and Asp-Tar1 were grown
and diffracted to resolutions of 2.10 and 2.40 Å, respectively. Alternatively,
using sodium chloride as a precipitant, crystals of apo-Tar2 and Asp-Tar2 were
grown and diffracted to resolutions of 1.95 and 1.58 Å, respectively. Crystals of
apo-Tar1 and Asp-Tar1 adopted space group P41212, while those of apo-Tar2 and
Asp-Tar2 adopted space groups P212121 and C2, respectively.
