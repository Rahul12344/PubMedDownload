Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a nephrotoxic mycotoxin produced by Aspergillus and
Penicillium fungi. It contaminates human and animal food products, and chronic
exposure is associated with renal fibrosis in humans (Balkan endemic
nephropathy). Resveratrol, a phytoalexin, possesses anti-cancer and antioxidant
properties. We investigated the mechanism of cellular oxidative stress induced by
OTA, and the effect of resveratrol in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells over 
24 and 48 h. Cells were exposed to OTA [IC50 = 1.5 μM (24 h) and 9.4 μM (48 h)
determined using MTT assay] and 25 μM resveratrol. Glutathione was quantified by 
luminometry and gene expression of Nrf2 and OGG1 was determined by qPCR. Protein 
expression of Nrf2, LonP1, SIRT3, and pSIRT1 was assessed by Western blot, DNA
damage (comet assay), and intracellular reactive oxygen species (flow cytometry).
At 24 h, resveratrol increased mRNA expression of the DNA repair enzyme, OGG1
(P < 0.05), whereas OTA and OTA+resveratrol significantly decreased OGG1
expression (P < 0.05). OGG1 expression increased during 48-h exposure to
resveratrol and OTA+resveratrol (P < 0.05). Comet tail lengths doubled in 48-h
OTA-treated cells, whereas at both time periods, OTA+resveratrol yielded shorter 
comet tails (P < 0.0001). During 24- and 48-h exposure, OTA, resveratrol, and
OTA+resveratrol significantly decreased mRNA expression of Nrf2 (P < 0.05).
Luminometry analysis of GSH revealed an increase by OTA+resveratrol for 24 and
48 h (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Western blot analysis showed
decreased Nrf2 protein expression during 24-h exposure, but increased Nrf2
expression during 48 h. LonP1 protein expression increased during 24-h exposure
to OTA (P < 0.05) and OTA+resveratrol (P < 0.0011) and during 48-h exposure to
resveratrol (P < 0.0005).
