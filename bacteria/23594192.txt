BACKGROUND: High levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a healing factor with 
regenerative and cytoprotective effects, are associated with inflammatory
diseases, including periodontitis. HGF biologic activity requires binding to its 
receptors, the proto-oncogene c-Met and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). This
study investigates HGF expression and its relationship to subgingival microbiota 
in medically healthy individuals with and without periodontitis.
METHODS: Saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), and blood samples from 30
patients with severe periodontitis and 30 healthy controls were analyzed for HGF 
concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and binding affinity for
HSPG and c-Met using surface plasmon resonance. The regenerative effects of
saliva from three patients and controls were analyzed in an in vitro model of
cell injury. Subgingival plaques were analyzed for the presence of 18 bacterial
species.
RESULTS: Patients with periodontitis showed higher HGF concentrations in saliva, 
GCF, and serum (P <0.001); however, the binding affinities for HSPG and c-Met
were reduced in GCF and saliva (P <0.002). In contrast to the controls, saliva
from patients showed no significant regenerative effect over time on gingival
epithelial cells. Compared with controls, patients had a higher prevalence of
periodontally related bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher circulatory HGF levels indicate a systemic effect of
periodontitis. However, the HGF biologic activity at local inflammation sites was
reduced, and this effect was associated with the amount of periodontal bacteria. 
Loss of function of healing factors may be an important mechanism in degenerative
processes in periodontally susceptible individuals.
