Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) is a G-coupled transmembrane receptor
expressed by multiple cell types present in the lungs that can be activated by
various proteases generated during acute inflammation. In this study we aimed to 
investigate the role of PAR-1 during melioidosis, a common cause of
(pneumo)sepsis in Southeast Asia in a murine model of intranasal inoculation of
the causative pathogen Burkholderia (B.) pseudomallei. Our results show that
endogenous PAR-1 facilitates bacterial growth and dissemination during murine
melioidosis, which is associated with increased cell influxes. However, these
observations have no impact on survival.
