OBJECTIVE: Recent evidences suggest that Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 
(Jab1) specifically interacts with the Cdk inhibitor p27kip1 and induces nuclear 
export and subsequent degradation of p27kip1. The purpose of this study is to
investigate whether Jab1 expression is correlated with p27kip1 level in
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas(NHLs) and how it influenced the stability of p27kip1, as 
well as whether Jab1 expression is associated with clinicopathologic variables
and prognosis of NHLs.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Jab1 expression was negatively 
associated with p27kip1 level and significantly associated with unfavorable
clinicopathologic variables. Overexpression Jab1 in lymphoma cell lines Jurkat
resulted in decreased p27kip1 level and advanced progression from G(1) to S phase
of the cell cycle. Subcellular fractionation confirmed Jab1 could lead to nuclear
export of p27kip1. Phosphorylation of p27kip1 at Ser10 and Thr157 was
significantly increased after Jab1 transient transfected, while Thr187
phosphorylation was decreased. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Jab1
overexpression facilitated p27kip1 to dissociate from Cdk2 and associated with
Cdk4. Finally, Survival analysis revealed that Jab1 overexpression is
significantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.000). When Jab1 and p27kip1
are combined, patients with Jab1(+)/p27kip1(-) revealed poorer overall survival
(p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that Jab1 protein is an independent
prognostic indicator for overall survival.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical and/or Western blot analysis was done in 116 cases
of NHLs and Jurkat cells.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Jab1 protein may contribute to the tumor
progression through Jab1-mediated p27kip1 degradation and that control of Jab1
expression is a novel therapeutic target with NHLs.
