HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 allele frequencies were determined by high-resolution
polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes
(PCR-SSOP) and/or DNA sequencing in 126 healthy individuals in Cameroon. Eighteen
DRB1, 11 DQA1, and 18 DQB1 alleles were observed. The most common alleles at each
locus were DRB1*1503 (29%), DRB1*1301 (13%); DQA1*0102 (38%), DQA1*0302 (11%),
DQA1*0401 (11%); and DQB1*0602 (31%), DQB1*0301 (13%), DQB1*0501 (12%).
Forty-four different haplotypes were identified including 12 novel haplotypes
demonstrating the HLA class II diversity resulting from allele combinations in
this population. A single predominant DRB1*1503-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 haplotype was
observed with a frequency of 27%. In summary, this study of HLA class II
polymorphism in Cameroon demonstrates the extent of diversity in this population.
