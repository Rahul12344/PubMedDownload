BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus rhamnosus C6 strain showed higher β-glucosidase
activity as well as biotransformation of isoflavones from glycones (daidzin and
genistin) to aglycones (daidzein and genistein) in soymilk. However, L. rhamnosus
C2 and Lactobacillus casei NCDC297 also exhibited similar activity during soymilk
fermentation. These three strains can be selected for the development of
functional fermented soy foods enriched with aglycone forms of isoflavones, such 
as soy yoghurt, soy cheese, soy beverages and soy dahi.
RESULTS: The study determined β-glucosidase activity of probiotic Lactobacillus
cultures for bioconversion of isoflavones to aglycones in fermenting soymilk
medium. Soymilk was fermented with six strains (L. rhamnosus C6 and C2, L.
rhamnosus NCDC19 and NCDC24 and L. casei NCDC17 and NCDC297) at 37 °C for 12 h.
The highest β-glucosidase activity and isoflavone bioconversion after 12 h
occurred by L. rhamnosus C6 culture during fermentation in soymilk. Increased
isoflavone aglycone content in fermented soymilk is likely to improve the
biological functionality of soymilk (e.g. antioxidant activity, alleviation of
hormonal disorders in postmenopausal women, etc.).
CONCLUSION: Lactobacillus rhamnosus C6 culture can be used for the development of
functional fermented soy-based products.
