OBJECTIVE: Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) can be used as a
vector for gene therapies. In order to predict the number of HSPCs cells
necessary to achieve the target level of chimerism in an autologous setting,
syngeneic male bone marrow (BM) cells were transplanted into 35 non-conditioned
female BALB/c mice.
METHOD: The resulting chimerism was determined at 6-53 weeks using qPCR, cell
subpopulation sorting, and colony-forming units (CFU) analysis.
RESULTS: After the transplantation of 125.8 ± 2.5 million nucleated BM cells, the
BM of recipients contained 20.0 ± 2.8% donor cells, representing a chimerism of
0.16 ± 0.02% per one million transplanted nucleated BM cells. Chimerism levels in
the BM, neutrophils, and B cells were comparable, whereas in T cells it was
lower, and in CFU was approximately twice greater than in BM.
CONCLUSION: By extrapolating our murine data, and data from some previous studies
to a human non-conditioned autologous CD34+ HSPC transplantation setting, we
conclude that approximately 44 million CD34+ HSPCs would be needed to achieve 20%
donor chimerism in a 70-kg human, which could serve as a starting point for the
future use of HSCPs in gene and cell therapy.
