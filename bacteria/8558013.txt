Cross-linking of the CD28 Ag on T cells results in increased beta
1-integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin. Chimeric contructs containing the
CD28 cytoplasmic domain fused to the extracellular and transmembrane regions of
CD2 were expressed in HL60 cells to investigate CD28-mediated regulation of
adhesion. Ab cross-linking of the CD2/28 chimera resulted in increased beta
1-dependent adhesion of HL60 transfectants to fibronectin. Induced binding was
completely inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) inhibitor
wortmannin. Cross-linking of the CD2/28 chimera also induced association of the
p85 subunit of PI 3-K with the CD2/28 cytoplasmic domain. In contrast,
cross-linking of a CD2/28 chimera containing a tyrosine to phenylalanine
substitution in the YMNM motif did not result in increased adhesion to
fibronectin and did not lead to association of the chimera with PI 3-K. These
results directly implicate the YMNM motif and PI 3-K in the regulation of beta
1-integrin activity by the CD28 Ag.
