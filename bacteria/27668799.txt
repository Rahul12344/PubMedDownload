Mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAIT cells) detect microbial vitamin B2
derivatives presented by the antigen-presenting molecule MR1. Here we defined
three developmental stages and checkpoints for the MAIT cell lineage in humans
and mice. Stage 1 and stage 2 MAIT cells predominated in thymus, while stage 3
cells progressively increased in abundance extrathymically. Transition through
each checkpoint was regulated by MR1, whereas the final checkpoint that generated
mature functional MAIT cells was controlled by multiple factors, including the
transcription factor PLZF and microbial colonization. Furthermore, stage 3 MAIT
cell populations were expanded in mice deficient in the antigen-presenting
molecule CD1d, suggestive of a niche shared by MAIT cells and natural killer T
cells (NKT cells). Accordingly, this study maps the developmental pathway and
checkpoints that control the generation of functional MAIT cells.
