The global threat of multiresistant pathogens has to be answered by the
development of novel antibiotics. Established antibiotic applications are often
based on so-called secondary or specialized metabolites (SMs), identified in
large screening approaches. To continue this successful strategy, new sources for
bioactive compounds are required, such as the bacterial genera Xenorhabdus or
Photorhabdus. In these strains, fabclavines are widely distributed SMs with a
broad-spectrum bioactivity. Fabclavines are hybrid SMs derived from nonribosomal 
peptide synthetases (NRPS), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), and polyketide
synthases (PKS). Selected Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus mutant strains were
generated applying a chemically inducible promoter in front of the suggested
fabclavine (fcl) biosynthesis gene cluster (BGC), followed by the analysis of the
occurring fabclavines. Subsequently, known and unknown derivatives were
identified and confirmed by MALDI-MS and MALDI-MS2 experiments in combination
with an optimized sample preparation. This led to a total number of 22 novel
fabclavine derivatives in eight strains, increasing the overall number of
fabclavines to 32. Together with the identification of fabclavines as major
antibiotics in several entomopathogenic strains, our work lays the foundation for
the rapid fabclavine identification and dereplication as the basis for future
work of this widespread and bioactive SM class.
