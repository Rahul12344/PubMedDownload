Candida sepsis. Implications of polymicrobial blood-borne infection.

Dyess DL, Garrison RN, Fry DE.

Eighty-three patients with 117 episodes of candidemia were reviewed to examine
the clinically significant variables and the results of treatment for this
problem. Mortality was 52%. Patients who had bacteremia either synchronously or
metachronously in association with Candida species had poorer survival rates.
Staphylococcal and enterococcal species were the most frequently associated
bacteria. Patients with Candida parapsilosis had better survival rates than
patients with other species. Portals of entry for fungemia were catheters,
wounds, the urinary tract, and the peritoneal cavity, but were undefined in 54%
of patients. Antifungal chemotherapy could not be identified as affecting the
outcome in these patients. It is suggested that candidemia in most patients
represents a failure of host defense, and that septicemia of either bacteria or
fungi may arise from the gastrointestinal tract in critically ill,
immunocompromised patients.
