Severe outbreaks of malaria occurred in the coastal villages of the Candolim
Primary Health Centre (PHC) of Goa, India, in 1993 and 1994. These outbreaks were
associated with accelerated construction activity with an influx of migrant
laborers. The weekly application of Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis
(B.t.i.) strain 164 at 1 g/m2 and introduction of the indigenous larvivorous fish
Aplocheilus blocki in major breeding habitats of Anopheles stephensi replaced
ongoing DDT spraying and pyrethrum fogging in June 1994. The objective of this
study was to evaluate the effects of B.t.i. and larvivorous fish on An. stephensi
and subsequent transmission of malaria in the Candolim PHC, Goa, India. In 1995
the populations of an. stephensi in larger habitats (habitats with immatures: t =
5.19, P = 0.0017; immature density: t = 3.57, P = 0.007) and smaller habitats
(habitats with immature: t = 3.86, P = 0.005; immature density: t = 4.93, P =
0.002) and malaria incidence declined substantially (malaria cases: chi 2 = 712, 
P < 0.001; slide positivity rate: chi 2 = 10.36, P < 0.001; annual parasite
index; chi 2 = 15.1, P < 0.001), whereas the incidence of malaria continued to
increase in other nearby towns.
