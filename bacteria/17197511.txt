PURPOSE: Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA(22:6,n3)) is the principal n3 polyunsaturated 
fatty acid (PUFA) in the retina. The authors previously demonstrated that
DHA(22:6,n3) inhibited cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in primary
human retinal vascular endothelial (hRVE) cells, the target tissue affected by
diabetic retinopathy. Despite the importance of vascular inflammation in diabetic
retinopathy, the mechanisms underlying anti-inflammatory effects of DHA(22:6,n3) 
in vascular endothelial cells are not understood. In this study the authors
address the hypothesis that DHA(22:6,n3) acts through modifying lipid composition
of caveolae/lipid rafts, thereby changing the outcome of important signaling
events in these specialized plasma membrane microdomains.
METHODS: hRVE cells were cultured in the presence or absence of DHA(22:6,n3).
Isolated caveolae/lipid raft-enriched detergent-resistant membrane domains were
prepared using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Fatty acid composition and
cholesterol content of caveolae/lipid rafts before and after treatment were
measured by HPLC. The expression of Src family kinases was assayed by Western
blotting and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Disruption of the caveolae/lipid raft structure with a
cholesterol-depleting agent, methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD), diminished
cytokine-induced signaling in hRVE cells. Growth of hRVE cells in media enriched 
in DHA(22:6,n3) resulted in significant incorporation of DHA(22:6,n3) into the
major phospholipids of caveolae/lipid rafts, causing an increase in the
unsaturation index in the membrane microdomain. DHA(22:6,n3) enrichment in the
caveolae/raft was accompanied by a 70% depletion of cholesterol from
caveolae/lipid rafts and displacement of the SFK, Fyn, and c-Yes from
caveolae/lipid rafts. Adding water-soluble cholesterol to DHA(22:6,n3)-treated
cells replenished cholesterol in caveolae/lipid rafts and reversed the effect of 
DHA(22:6,n3) on cytokine-induced signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of DHA(22:6,n3) into fatty acyl chains of
phospholipids in caveolae/lipid rafts, followed by cholesterol depletion and
displacement of important signaling molecules, provides a potential mechanism for
anti-inflammatory effect of DHA(22:6,n3) in hRVE cells.
