The molecular mechanisms that operate within the organ microenvironment to
support metastatic progression remain unclear. Here, we report that upregulation 
of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) occurs in highly metastatic breast cancer
stem-like cells (CSC) defined by CD44(+)/CD24(-)/ESA(+) phenotype, where it plays
a critical role in the generation of a prometastatic microenvironment in breast
cancer. HAS2 was critical for the interaction of CSCs with tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM), leading to enhanced secretion of platelet-derived growth
factor-BB from TAMs, which then activated stromal cells and enhanced CSC
self-renewal. Loss of HAS2 in CSCs or treatment with 4-methylumbelliferone, an
inhibitor of HAS, which blocks hyaluronan production, drastically reduced the
incidence and growth of metastatic lesions in vitro or in vivo, respectively.
Taken together, our findings show a critical role of HAS2 in the development of a
prometastatic microenvironment and suggest that HAS2 inhibitors can act as
antimetastatic agents that disrupt a paracrine growth factor loop within this
microenvironment.
