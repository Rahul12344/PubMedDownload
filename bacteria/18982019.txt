Natural killer T (NKT) cells are positively selected on cortical thymocytes
expressing the non-classical major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I CD1d 
molecules. However, it is less clear how NKT cells are negatively selected in the
thymus. In this study, we investigated the role of MHC class II expression in NKT
cell development. Transgenic mice expressing MHC class II on thymocytes and
peripheral T cells had a marked reduction in invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Reduced 
numbers of iNKT cells correlated with the absence of in vivo production of
cytokines in response to the iNKT cell agonist alpha-galactosylceramide. Using
mixed bone marrow chimeras, we found that MHC class II-expressing thymocytes
suppressed the development of iNKT cells in trans in a CD4-dependent manner. Our 
observations have significant implications for human iNKT cell development as
human thymocytes express MHC class II, which can lead to an inefficient selection
of iNKT cells.
