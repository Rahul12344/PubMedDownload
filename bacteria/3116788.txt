In a random sample comprising 160 test persons nitrate (12.4 +/- 7.6 mg/l) and
nitrite (5.7 +/- 4.0 mg/l) concentrations as well as bacteria counts in saliva
were determined. No dependence of the values from age and sex could be detected, 
whereas smokers have lower concentrations of both nitrate and nitrite. Persons
suffering from inflammatory diseases did not have enhanced nitrate
concentrations. Role of bacteria for nitrite production is confirmed. Patients,
regularly taking nitro-remedies, showed enhanced NO3--(25.8 mg/l) and NO2--(8.4
mg/l)-values.
