1,1-Dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a toxic breakdown product of 
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), has traditionally been
viewed as a dead-end metabolite: there are no published reports detailing
enzymatic ring fission of DDE by bacteria in either soil or pure culture. In this
study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas acidovorans M3GY to transform
DDE and its unchlorinated analog, 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE). While strain M3GY
could grow on DPE, cells grown on DPE as a sole carbon source could not degrade
DDE. Cells grown on biphenyl, however, did degrade DDE. Mass balance analysis of 
[14C]DDE showed transformation of more than 40% of the recoverable radioactivity.
Nine chlorinated metabolites produced from DDE were identified by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry-Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry
(GC-MS-FTIR) from cultures grown on biphenyl. Recovery of these metabolites
demonstrates that biphenyl-grown cells degrade DDE through a meta-fission
pathway. This study provides a possible model for biodegradation of DDE in soil
by biphenyl-utilizing bacteria.
