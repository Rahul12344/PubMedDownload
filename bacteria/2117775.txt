C6 is a potentially therapeutic murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes the
class 1 outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis. C6 specifically
immunoblots this antigen and augments in vitro killing of N. meningitidis
bacteria. We describe a general method of obtaining the heavy and light chain
variable-region sequence from immunoglobulin-secreting cells. The method uses
mixed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed from the 5' end of the
framework 1 (FR1) sequences of the heavy and light chains, and 3'-end primers for
constant-region conserved sequences. The method has been applied to the cloning
and sequencing of the variable region of C6 to construct a humanized monoclonal
antibody. Rapid amplification and sequencing of variable regions by this general 
method have multiple applications in the study of the immune response to
infectious diseases.
