BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of long-term use of
immunosuppressive agents on immune response.
OBJECTIVES: Assess the impact of continuous maintenance ustekinumab treatment on 
patients' ability to mount immune responses to pneumococcal (T-cell-independent) 
and tetanus toxoid (T-cell-dependent) vaccines.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ustekinumab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe
psoriasis treated in the long-term extension of the Phase 3 PHOENIX 2 trial
(n=60) were compared with control psoriasis patients not receiving systemic
therapy (n=56). Patients were vaccinated with both 23-valent pneumococcal and
tetanus toxoid vaccines. Serum samples collected pre-vaccination and 4 weeks
post-vaccination were assessed for antibody responses.
RESULTS: No differences in the ability of ustekinumab-treated patients to respond
to pneumococcal or tetanus toxoid vaccinations were observed compared with
controls. A ≥2-fold increase in antibody levels in ≥7 of 14 serotypes of the
pneumococcal vaccine was observed in ustekinumab-treated (96.6%) and untreated
control (92.6%) patients following vaccination. Ustekinumab-treated patients
achieved a ≥4-fold increase (84.7%) in anti-tetanus antibody vs. 77.8% in the
control group. No differences were detected in ex-vivo responses to anti-CD3/CD28
or tetanus toxoid between ustekinumab-treated and control groups.
CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment (≥3 years) with ustekinumab does not compromise
the immune response to T-cell-dependent/-independent vaccines in patients with
moderate-to-severe psoriasis.
