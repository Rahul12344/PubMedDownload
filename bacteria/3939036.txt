The rate of absorption of metabolite products and accumulation of microorganisms 
on the skin from knitted wear, with different combination of wool /W/ and
polyacrylonitrile fibers /PAN/ and of 100% PAN regular production and modified
/11 types of products/, is examined in laboratory and natural conditions, as well
as bacteriostatic effect related to some important microorganisms. A clearly
expressed reverse dependence is established between the absorbing properties of
the knitted wear and the metabolite products on the skin and the progressive
increase of synthetic PAN fibres in the content. Especially evident is the
difference in the quantity of products between the knitted wear of 100% PAN
/regular production and modified/ and 100% wool. Considerable are also the
differences in the products with the participation of PAN above 50%. This
presuppose bad cleaning ability of these articles and accumulation of residual
products. Two vague tendencies--bacteriostatic effect and bad cleaning of skin
from the knitted wear with large per cent of PAN fibres /70 and 100%/, which are 
to be investigated additionally.
