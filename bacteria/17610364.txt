CD26, a surface serine dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) expressed on different cell
types, cleaves the amino-terminal dipeptide from some chemokines, including
stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12). SDF-1/CXCL12 plays important roles in
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homing, engraftment, and mobilization. Inhibition
of CD26 peptidase activity enhances homing, engraftment, and competitive
repopulation in congenic mouse bone marrow cell transplants. Our studies
evaluated a role for CD26 in in vivo engraftment of HSCs from human umbilical
cord blood (CB) into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency
(NOD/SCID) mice. Pretreating purified CD34(+) human CB cells with Diprotin A, a
DPPIV inhibitor, for 15 min significantly enhanced engraftment. Treatment did not
affect differentiation of CD34(+) cells in vivo, as measured phenotypically by
human markers CD33, CD38, CD19, and CD34. We found that the percentage of CD26(+)
cells within the more immature cells (CD34(+)CD38()) was significantly higher
than in the more mature population (CD34(+)CD38(+)). These results suggest that
inhibition of CD26 may be one way to enhance engraftment of limiting numbers of
stem cells during CB transplantation.
