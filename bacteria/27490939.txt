Adoptive T-cell immunotherapy is a promising approach to manage and maintain
relapse-free survival of leukemia patients, especially following allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation. Post-transplant adoptive immunotherapy using cytotoxic T
lymphocytes (CTLs) of the donor origin provide graft-versus-tumor effects, with
or without graft-versus-host disease. Myeloid leukemias express immunogenic
leukemia associated antigens (LAAs); such as WT-1, PRAME, MAGE, h-TERT and
others, most of them are able to induce specific T cell responses whenever
associated with the proper co-stimulation. We investigated the ability of a
LAA-expressing hybridoma cell line to induce CTL clones in PBMCs of HLA-matched
healthy donors in vitro. The CTL clones were induced by repetitive co-culture
with LAAs-expressing, HLA-A*0201(+) hybrid cell line, generated by fusion of
leukemia blasts to human immortalized APC (EBV-sensitized B-lymphoblastoid cell
line; HMy2). The induced cytotoxic T cell clones were phenotypically and
functionally characterized by pentamer analysis, IFN-γ release ELISPOT and
cellular cytotoxicity assays. All T cell lines showed robust peptide recognition 
and functional activity when sensitized with HLA-A*0201-restricted WT-1235-243,
hTERT615-624 or PRAME100-108 peptides-pulsed T2 cells, in addition to partially
HLA-matched leukemia blasts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing multi-tumor antigen-specific T cell lines in allogeneic PBMCs in
vitro, using LAA-expressing tumor/HMy2 hybrid cell line model, for potential use 
in leukemia adoptive immunotherapy in partially matched donor-recipient setting.
