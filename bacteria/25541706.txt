We show in this study that the combination of a swirl flow reactor and an
antimicrobial agent (in this case copper alginate beads) is a promising technique
for the remediation of contaminated water in waste streams recalcitrant to UV-C
treatment. This is demonstrated by comparing the viability of both common and
UV-C resistant organisms in operating conditions where UV-C proves ineffective - 
notably high levels of solids and compounds which deflect UV-C. The swirl flow
reactor is easy to construct from commonly available plumbing parts and may prove
a versatile and powerful tool in waste water treatment in developing countries.
