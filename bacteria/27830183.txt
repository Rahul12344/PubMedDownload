BACKGROUND: Occurring frequently after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation, cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication remains a relevant cause of
mortality and morbidity in affected patients. Despite these adverse effects, an
increased alloreactivity of natural killer (NK) cells after CMV infection has
been assumed, but the underlying physiopathological mechanisms have remained
elusive.
METHODS: We used serial analyses of NK cells before and after CMV infection in
kidney transplant recipients as an in vivo model for CMV primary infection to
explore the imprint of CMV infection using every patient as their own control: We
analyzed NK cell phenotype and function in 47 CMV seronegative recipients of CMV 
seropositive kidney grafts, who developed CMV primary infection posttransplant.
Seronegative recipients of seronegative kidney grafts served as controls.
RESULTS: We observed a significant increase of NKG2C expressing NK cells after
CMV infection (mean increase, 17.5%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10.2-24.9,
P < 0.001), whereas cluster of differentiation (CD)57 expressing cells decreased 
(mean decrease, 14.1%; 95% CI, 8.0-20.2; P < 0.001). Analysis of killer
immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) expression showed an increase of cells
expressing KIR2DL1 as their only inhibitory KIR in patients carrying the cognate 
ligand HLA-C2 (mean increase, 10.0%; 95% CI, 1.7-18.3; P = 0.018). In C2-negative
individuals, KIR2DL1 expression decreased (mean decrease, 3.9%; 95% CI, 1.6-6.2; 
P = 0.001). As for activating KIR, there was no conclusive change pattern. Most
importantly, we observed a significantly higher NK cell degranulation and IFNγ
production in response to different target cells (target K562, CD107a: mean
increase, 9.9%; 95% CI, 4.8-15.0; P < 0.001; IFNγ: mean increase, 6.6%; 95% CI,
1.6-11.1; P < 0.001; target MRC-5, CD107a: mean increase, 6.9%; 95% CI, 0.7-13.1;
P = 0.03; IFNγ: mean increase, 4.8%; 95% CI, 1.7-7.8; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: We report evidence for an increased function of NK cells induced by 
CMV infection. This increased in vitro functionality was seen in NKG2C-positive
and NKG2C-negative subsets, arguing for an NKG2C independent mechanism of action.
