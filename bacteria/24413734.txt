Peripheral T cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are a heterogeneous and poorly understood
group of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing of 12
tumor-normal DNA pairs, RNA sequencing analysis and targeted deep sequencing to
identify new genetic alterations in PTCL transformation. These analyses
identified highly recurrent epigenetic factor mutations in TET2, DNMT3A and IDH2 
as well as a new highly prevalent RHOA mutation encoding a p.Gly17Val alteration 
present in 22 of 35 (67%) angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) samples and
in 8 of 44 (18%) PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) samples.
Mechanistically, the RHOA Gly17Val protein interferes with RHOA signaling in
biochemical and cellular assays, an effect potentially mediated by the
sequestration of activated guanine-exchange factor (GEF) proteins. In addition,
we describe new and recurrent, albeit less frequent, genetic defects including
mutations in FYN, ATM, B2M and CD58 implicating SRC signaling, impaired DNA
damage response and escape from immune surveillance mechanisms in the
pathogenesis of PTCL.
