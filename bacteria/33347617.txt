remodeling RA macrophages into mature osteoclasts.

This study elucidates the mechanism of CCL25 and CCR9 in rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). RA synovial fluid (SF) expresses elevated levels of CCL25 compared to OA SF
and plasma from RA and normal. CCL25 was released into RA SF by fibroblasts (FLS)
and macrophages (MΦs) stimulated with IL-1β and IL-6. CCR9 is also presented on
IL-1β and IL-6 activated RA FLS and differentiated MΦs. Conversely, in RA PBMCs
neither CCL25 nor CCR9 are impacted by 3-month longitudinal TNF inhibitor
therapy. CCL25 amplifies RA FLS and monocyte infiltration via p38 and ERK
phosphorylation. CCL25-stimulated RA FLS secrete potentiated levels of IL-8 which
is disrupted by p38 and ERK inhibitors. CCL25 polarizes RA monocytes into
nontraditional M1 MΦs that produce IL-8 and CCL2. Activation of p38 and ERK
cascades are also responsible for the CCL25-induced M1 MΦ development.
Unexpectedly, CCL25 was unable to polarize RA PBMCs into effector Th1/Th17 cells.
Consistently, lymphokine like RANKL was uninvolved in CCL25-induced
osteoclastogenesis; however, this manifestation was regulated by osteoclastic
factors such as RANK, cathepsin K (CTSK), and TNF-α. In short, we reveal that
CCL25/CCR9 manipulates RA FLS and MΦ migration and inflammatory phenotype in
addition to osteoclast formation via p38 and ERK activation.
