AIMS: Clinical and urodynamic evaluation of the late outcome of 25 patients with 
chronic tuberculous cystitis who underwent bladder augmentation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty men and five women with median age of 40 years were 
evaluated. The tubularized ileocecal segment was used in 8 cases, the
detubularized sigmoid in 13, and the tubularized sigmoid in 4. Patients underwent
a postoperative clinical and urodynamic evaluation. Miccional diurnal frequency
of more than 2 hr together with patient satisfaction as assessed by the quality
of life question of the ICSmaleSF questionnaire was considered a good result.
RESULTS: The average postoperative follow-up was of 11.1 +/- 9.1 (1 to 36) years.
A good result was seen in 80% of the patients. Bad results occurred statistically
in the cases using tubularized sigmoid and in patients with prostatitis. Patients
with good results showed augmented bladders with normal sensation (P = 0.03) and 
greater capacity (P < 0.01) and compliance (P < 0.01) than did those with bad
results. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of
involuntary contractions (P = 0.27) but in the good result patients, the
contractions started with greater bladder filling volume (P = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The sigmoid should be detubularized but the ileocecal segment may be
used in its original tubularized form to augment the bladder with chronic
tuberculous cystitis. Augmented bladder with capacity of more than 250 ml, good
compliance, and normal sensation are necessary for diurnal frequency of more than
2 hr. The presence of involuntary contractions does not lead to a decrease in the
diurnal frequency.
