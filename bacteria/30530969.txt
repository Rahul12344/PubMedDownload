OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between red 
blood cell (RBC) aggregation and deformability and angiogenesis parameters in
obese patients.
METHODS: We studied 35 obese subjects and 20 non-obese people as a control group.
Angiogenesis was detected using Bio-Plex Pro Human Angiogenesis Multiplex Assays.
The RBC aggregation and deformability of the red blood cell aggregation were
performed by the Laser-assisted Optical Rotational Cell Analyser - LORCA.
RESULTS: The aggregation index and the syllectogram's amplitude were
significantly higher in the obese patients, whereas the aggregation half-time
(t1/2) was lower compared with the control group. The deformability of RBC
expressed as EI was significantly lower in the obese group than it was in the
control group. All angiogenesis parameters were higher in obese individuals than 
they were in the control group. Significant differences were observed in
angiopoietin 2 (p = 0.048), folistin (p = 0.0017), G-CSF (p = 0.042), HGF
(p = 0.016), and PECAM-1 (p = 0.014). The VEGF tended to be higher in the obese
patients than in the control group (p = 0.09); nevertheless, the concentration of
PDGF-BB was similar in both groups. EI at shear stresses of 18.49 Pa and 30.2 Pa 
was strongly correlated with all angiogenesis parameters. No correlations were
found between the studied RBC aggregation indices and angiogenesis parameters.
Multivariate analyses indicated that only HGF was an independent predictor of RBC
deformability at 18.49 Pa (β-0.83, P < 0.000005) and at 30.2 Pa (β-0.83,
P < 0.00005).
CONCLUSIONS: The study found that there are relationships between enhanced RBC
rigidity and angiogenesis status in obese subjects. Because this correlation
between angiogenesis and RBC deformability is presented for the first time, the
physiological importance of the relationship requires further research.
