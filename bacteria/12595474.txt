The cocrystal structure of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin C (SPE C) with
HLA-DR2a (DRA*0101,DRB5*0101) revealed a zinc-dependent interaction site through 
residues 167, 201, and 203 on SPE C and residue 81 on the beta-chain of HLA-DR2a 
(DRA*0101,DRB5*0101). Mutation of these SPE C residues resulted in dramatically
reduced biological activities. Thus, the zinc-dependent major histocompatibility 
complex II binding site is critical for maximal biological function of SPE C.
