Potassium depletion in the soil solution around plant roots promotes the root
uptake of radiocesium. However, it can also induce the transformation of mica
through the release of interlayer K. In bulk soil, the formation of frayed edge
sites (FES) with a high selectivity for Cs adsorption is usually related with
mica weathering. We studied the effect of K level in the nutrient solution on the
root-induced weathering of phlogopite as well as on the root uptake of
radiocesium by willow (Salix viminalis L. var. Orm). The willows were grown for 7
wk in column lysimeters filled with a quartz-phlogopite mixed substrate
continuously irrigated with nutrient solutions differing in K concentration (0-2 
mM). From a potassium supply of 0.4 mM downward, we observed a decrease in root
uptake of potassium as well as an increase in (i) potassium release from
phlogopite, (ii) degree of transformation of phlogopite into vermiculite, and
(iii) root uptake of radiocesium. Increasing K depletion had thus two effects: a 
decrease of the root uptake of potassium and an increase of phlogopite weathering
in the rhizosphere, both of which promoted the root uptake of radiocesium.
