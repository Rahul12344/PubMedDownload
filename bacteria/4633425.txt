Location and consequences of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane
uptake by Bacillus megaterium.

Hicks GF Jr, Corner TR.

No detrimental effects of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT)
were observed when cells of Bacillus megaterium were grown from small inocula in 
nutrient media containing up to 100 mug of DDT/ml. However, when the ratio of DDT
to biomass of resting cells was held constant, levels of DDT as low as 1 mug/ml
(0.5 mug/mg of cell dry weight) enhanced the rate of death in the population. The
lethal action of DDT was both time- and dose-dependent so that higher doses
required less time to effect the same killing than did lower doses. Intact cells 
bound a maximum of about 1.7 mug of DDT/mg of cell dry weight, of which about 75%
was localized in the protoplast membrane. Much of the bound DDT was subsequently 
lost to the suspending medium and the aqueous stability of the returned DDT was
enhanced, possibly by association with solubilized cell materials. A small
quantity of bound DDT was converted to
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, which was released from cells
somewhat faster than DDT. Apparently the lethal action of DDT was related to its 
binding in the membrane, but respiration was not inhibited. The atypical
macroscopic appearance of membranes isolated from treated cells suggested that
cell death may result from altered membrane chemistry.
