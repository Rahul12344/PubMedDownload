Alkaline xylanase C from the alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. (NCL 87-6-10) has a low
molecular weight and alkaline pI and is cellulase-free, properties compatible
with its use in the prebleaching of pulp. We report here the cloning and sequence
analysis of three variants of the gene encoding xylanase C; xyl C1, xyl C2, and
xyl C3. In phylogenetic analysis, the three xylanase C variants clustered into a 
single group along with other reported alkaline xylanases. Residues contributing 
to the alkaline pH were present in all three variants. DNA and protein sequence
comparison of these variants with other reported alkaline xylanases revealed
silent mutations, some of which are due to codon preference in the respective
organisms. The recombinant Xyl C1 that was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21
(DE3) had properties similar to the native enzyme.
