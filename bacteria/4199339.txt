Biomagnification of p, p'-DDT and methoxychlor by bacteria.

Johnson BT, Kennedy JO.

Aerobacter aerogenes and Bacillus subtilis accumulated p, p'-DDT and methoxychlor
directly from water. Uptake of both (14)C-labeled organochlorine insecticides was
rapid; 80 to 90% of the 24-h residues were reached within 30 min. Total cellular 
residues varied linearly with concentrations of DDT and methoxychlor in water
ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 mug/liter. The residue magnification factors from water
were between 1,400- to 4,300-fold, but were independent of insecticide
concentrations in water. When the insecticide-exposed microbial cells were washed
with pesticide-free water, DDT residues were 45% in A. aerogenes and 30% in B.
subtilis, whereas the methoxychlor level decreased nearly 75% in both organisms. 
Subsequent washing did not further reduce the insecticide residue.
Autoclave-killed bacteria also rapidly adsorbed DDT and methoxychlor from water
and, in some instances, residues were higher than in the living cells. Molecular 
polarity and lipid solubility appear to influence the retention of the
organochlorine insecticides by bacterial cells.
