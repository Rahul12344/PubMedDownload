OBJECTIVE: Gut-derived innate lymphoid cell 3 (ILC3) has been shown to
participate in the pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). CX3 CR1+
mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) have been demonstrated to modulate ILC3 function in
the gut. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of proinflammatory CX3
CR1+CD59+ MNPs in modulating ILC3 function in AS patients.
METHODS: MNP subsets in the blood of AS patients and controls were analyzed by
flow cytometry. The presence of CX3 CR1+CD59+ cells in tissue was confirmed by
confocal microscopy. Expression of the proinflammatory chemokines CX3 CL1 and
CCL2 and decoy receptor 6 (DcR-6) was analyzed. Peripheral CX3 CR1+CD59+ cells
were cocultured with ILC3, and changes in their frequency were evaluated by flow 
cytometry. Transcriptome analysis of circulating CX3 CR1+ monocytes was also
performed.
RESULTS: DcR-6 deficiency and CCL2 overexpression were observed in inflamed
tissues from AS patients. In the gut, the proinflammatory CX3 CR1+CD59+ MNP
population was expanded, correlated with the presence of bacteria, and produced
high levels of tumor necrosis factor-like molecule 1A (TL1A) and interleukin-23
(IL-23). MNPs positive for CD11b, CD11c, and major histocompatibility complex
class II, predominantly expressing CX3 CR1, were also expanded in the small
intestines of treatment-naive SKG relative to BALB/c mice. The frequency of
gut-derived CX3 CR1+CD59+CCR9+TL1A+IL-23+ MNPs was significantly higher in the
peripheral blood and synovial fluid of AS patients than controls. CCR9+CX3
CR1+CD59+ monocytes were also expanded in AS synovial and bone marrow samples.
Transcriptome analysis of isolated CX3 CR1+CD59+ monocytes demonstrated a
specific proinflammatory profile in AS. Isolated proinflammatory CX3 CR1+CD59+
MNPs from AS patients induced the expansion and activation of ILC3.
CONCLUSION: Proinflammatory CX3 CR1+CD59+TL1A+IL-23+ MNPs are expanded in AS
patients and display a specific proinflammatory transcriptome profile. Given the 
ability of these cells to support ILC3 expansion, they may promote a sustained
proinflammatory status in AS.
