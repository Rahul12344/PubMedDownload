Cluster of differentiation 1c (CD1c)-dependent self-reactive T cells are abundant
in human blood, but self-antigens presented by CD1c to the T-cell receptors of
these cells are poorly understood. Here we present a crystal structure of CD1c
determined at 2.4 Å revealing an extended ligand binding potential of the antigen
groove and a substantially different conformation compared with known CD1c
structures. Computational simulations exploring different occupancy states of the
groove reenacted these different CD1c conformations and suggested cholesteryl
esters (CE) and acylated steryl glycosides (ASG) as new ligand classes for CD1c. 
Confirming this, we show that binding of CE and ASG to CD1c enables the binding
of human CD1c self-reactive T-cell receptors. Hence, human CD1c adopts different 
conformations dependent on ligand occupancy of its groove, with CE and ASG
stabilizing CD1c conformations that provide a footprint for binding of CD1c
self-reactive T-cell receptors.
