Human T lymphocytes can be generated from CD34 progenitor cells from different
sources. This can be obtained in an in vivo model wherein human thymic tissue and
fetal liver is transplanted in an immunodeficient mouse. However, human T cells
are also generated in immunodeficient mice without co-transplantation of human
thymus or in in vitro hybrid human-mouse fetal thymus organ culture. This shows
that xenogeneic mouse thymus tissue supports human T cell differentiation.
Finally, human T cells are generated on co-culture with murine stromal cells that
express the Delta-like1 ligand for the Notch receptor. How these different
environments influence the human T cell repertoire is reviewed and discussed.
