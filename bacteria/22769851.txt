N-Terminal methylation of free α-amino groups is a post-translational
modification of proteins that was first described 30 years ago but has been
studied very little. In this modification, the initiating M residue is cleaved
and the exposed α-amino group is mono-, di-, or trimethylated by NRMT, a recently
identified N-terminal methyltransferase. Currently, all known eukaryotic
α-amino-methylated proteins have a unique N-terminal motif, M-X-P-K, where X is
A, P, or S. NRMT can also methylate artificial substrates in vitro in which X is 
G, F, Y, C, M, K, R, N, Q, or H. Methylation efficiencies of N-terminal amino
acids are variable with respect to the identity of X. Here we use in vitro
peptide methylation assays and substrate immunoprecipitations to show that the
canonical M-X-P-K methylation motif is not the only one recognized by NRMT. We
predict that N-terminal methylation is a widespread post-translational
modification and that there is interplay between N-terminal acetylation and
N-terminal methylation. We also use isothermal calorimetry experiments to
demonstrate that NRMT can efficiently recognize and bind to its fully methylated 
products.
