Background: Chondromodulin-I (CHM1) sustains malignancy in Ewing sarcoma (ES).
Refractory ES carries a dismal prognosis and patients with bone marrow (BM)
metastases do not survive irrespective of therapy. We assessed
HLA-A*02:01/CHM1-specific allorestricted T cell receptor (TCR) wild-type and
transgenic cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells against ES. Patients and Methods: Three
refractory HLA-A2+ ES patients were treated with HLA-A*02:01/peptide-specific
allorepertoire-derived (i.e., allorestricted) CD8+ T cells. Patient #1 received
up to 4.8 × 105/kg body weight HLA-A*02:01- allorestricted donor-derived
wild-type CD8+ T cells. Patient #2 received up to 8.2 × 106/kg HLA-A*02:01-
donor-derived and patient #3 up to 6 × 106/kg autologous allorestricted TCR
transgenic CD8+ T cells. All patients were treated with the same TCR
complementary determining region 3 allorecognition sequence for CHM1 peptide 319 
(CHM1319). Results: HLA-A*02:01/CHM1319-specific allorestricted CD8+ T cells
showed specific in vitro lysis of all patient-derived ES cell lines. Therapy was 
well tolerated and did not cause graft versus host disease (GvHD). Patients #1
and #3 showed slow progression, whereas patient #2, while having BM involvement, 
showed partial metastatic regression associated with T cell homing to involved
lesions. CHM1319 TCR transgenic T cells could be tracked in his BM for weeks.
Conclusions: CHM1319-TCR transgenic T cells home to affected BM and may cause
partial disease regression. HLA-A*02:01/antigen-specific allorestricted T cells
proliferate in vivo without causing GvHD.
