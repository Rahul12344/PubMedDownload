BACKGROUND: Cord blood banks have to determine the regenerative potential of cord
blood units (CBUs) on a representative sample of the cryopreserved product before
release to the transplant center. Potency can be measured by using a
colony-forming unit (CFU) method, which delays the release of CBU by 7 to
14 days. To accelerate CBU qualification, we have developed a rapid method to
assess the response of CD34 cells to interleukin (IL)-3. Flow cytometry was used 
to measure IL-3-induced STAT5 phosphorylation within CD34-cells. This IL-3 test
was compared to the CFU method, as well as the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)
enzyme-based assay.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten cryopreserved CBUs were analyzed for their contents
in CD34 and CD45 viable cells, total CFUs, ADLHbright cells, and IL-3-responsive 
CD34+ cells. Extreme and mild warming event scenarios were simulated on CBUs and 
used as poor-quality samples. Segments, tubes, and bags from five CBUs were
compared for their potency using IL-3 and CFU methods.
RESULTS: The IL-3 test was accurate in identifying the samples handled following 
standard operating procedures and those subjected to extreme warming events.
Based on these results, a threshold of 55% of IL-3-responsive CD34 cells was
established to identify good-quality samples. The IL-3 test was also the most
sensitive to detect samples subjected to milder warming events.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new method for determining CBU functionality is rapid, unbiased,
and robust. The IL-3 test described herein fulfills the requirements for
validation, and we intend to implement this method in our cord blood bank
facility.
