Efforts to develop live attenuated vaccines against Mycobacterium avium
subspecies paratuberculosis (Map), using indirect methods to screen Map deletion 
mutants for potential efficacy, have not been successful. A reduction in the
capacity to survive in macrophages has not predicted the ability of mutants to
survive in vivo. Previous studies for screening of three deletion mutants in
cattle and goats revealed one mutant, with a deletion in relA (ΔMap/relA), could 
not establish a persistent infection. Further studies, using antigen presenting
cells (APC), blood dendritic cells and monocyte derived DC, pulsed with ΔMap/relA
or a 35 kDa Map membrane protein (MMP) revealed a component of the response to
ΔMap/relA was directed towards MMP. As reported herein, we developed a bacterium 
viability assay and cell culture assays for analysis and evaluation of cytotoxic 
T cells generated against ΔMap/relA or MMP. Analysis of the effector activity of 
responding cells revealed the reason ΔMap/relA could not establish a persistent
infection was that vaccination elicited development of cytotoxic CD8 T cells
(CTL) with the capacity to kill intracellular bacteria. We demonstrated the same 
CTL response could be elicited with two rounds of antigenic stimulation of APC
pulsed with ΔMap/relA or MMP ex vivo. Cytotoxicity was mediated through the
perforin granzyme B pathway. Finally, cognate recognition of peptides presented
in context of MHC I and II molecules to CD4 and CD8 T cells is required for
development of CTL.
