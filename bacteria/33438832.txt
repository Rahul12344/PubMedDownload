Aldosterone synthase deficiency (ASD) is a rare potentially life-threatening
genetic disorder that usually presents during infancy due to pathogenic variants 
in the CYP11B2 gene. Knowledge about CYP11B2 variants in the Arab population is
scarce. Here, we present and analyze five Palestinian patients and their
different novel pathogenic variants. Data on clinical presentation, electrolytes,
plasma renin activity, and steroid hormone levels of five patients diagnosed with
ASD were summarized. Sequencing of the CYP11B2 gene exons was followed by
evolutionary conservation analysis and structural modeling of the variants. All
patients were from highly consanguineous Palestinian families. The patients
presented at 1-4 months of age with recurrent vomiting, poor weight gain,
hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and low aldosterone levels. Genetic analysis of the
CYP11B2 gene revealed three homozygous pathogenic variants: p.Ser344Profs*9,
p.G452W in two patients from an extended family, and p.Q338stop. A previously
described pathogenic variant was found in one patient: p.G288S. We described four
different CYP11B2 gene pathogenic variants in a relatively small population. Our 
findings may contribute to the future early diagnosis and therapy for patients
with ASD among Arab patients who present with failure to thrive and compatible
electrolyte disturbances.
