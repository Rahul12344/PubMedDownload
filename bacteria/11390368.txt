Procaspase-9 contains an NH2-terminal caspase-associated recruitment domain
(CARD), which is essential for direct association with Apaf-1 and activation.
Procaspase-1 also contains an NH2-terminal CARD domain, suggesting that its
mechanism of activation, like that of procaspase-9, involves association with an 
Apaf-1-related molecule. Here we describe the identification of a human
Apaf-1-related protein, named Ipaf that contains an NH2-terminal CARD domain, a
central nucleotide-binding domain, and a COOH-terminal regulatory leucine-rich
repeat domain (LRR). Ipaf associates directly and specifically with the CARD
domain of procaspase-1 through CARD-CARD interaction. A constitutively active
Ipaf lacking its COOH-terminal LRR domain can induce autocatalytic processing and
activation of procaspase-1 and caspase-1-dependent apoptosis in transfected
cells. Our results suggest that Ipaf is a specific and direct activator of
procaspase-1 and could be involved in activation of caspase-1 in response to
pro-inflammatory and apoptotic stimuli.
