BACKGROUND: Progressive fibrosis is the underlying pathophysiological process of 
CKD, and targeted prevention or reversal of the profibrotic cell phenotype is an 
important goal in developing therapeutics for CKD. Nanoparticles offer new ways
to deliver antifibrotic therapies to damaged tissues and resident cells to limit 
manifestation of the profibrotic phenotype.
METHODS: We focused on delivering plasmid DNA expressing bone morphogenetic
protein 7 (BMP7) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-NK1 (HGF/NK1) by encapsulation
within chitosan nanoparticles coated with hyaluronan, to safely administer
multifunctional nanoparticles containing the plasmid DNA to the kidneys for
localized and sustained expression of antifibrotic factors. We characterized and 
evaluated nanoparticles in vitro for biocompatibility and antifibrotic function. 
To assess antifibrotic activity in vivo, we used noninvasive delivery to
unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse models of CKD.
RESULTS: Synthesis of hyaluronan-coated chitosan nanoparticles containing plasmid
DNA expressing either BMP7 or NGF/NKI resulted in consistently sized
nanoparticles, which-following endocytosis driven by CD44+ cells-promoted
cellular growth and inhibited fibrotic gene expression in vitro. Intravenous tail
injection of these nanoparticles resulted in approximately 40%-45% of gene uptake
in kidneys in vivo. The nanoparticles attenuated the development of fibrosis and 
rescued renal function in unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse models of CKD.
Gene delivery of BMP7 reversed the progression of fibrosis and regenerated
tubules, whereas delivery of HGF/NK1 halted CKD progression by eliminating
collagen fiber deposition.
CONCLUSIONS: Nanoparticle delivery of HGF/NK1 conveyed potent antifibrotic and
proregenerative effects. Overall, this research provided the proof of concept on 
which to base future investigations for enhanced targeting and transfection of
therapeutic genes to kidney tissues, and an avenue toward treatment of CKD.
