The synthesis of eleven novel antibacterial agents is reported. The structures
are based on a C(2)-symmetric binaphthyl scaffold which holds two identical
chains consisting of a short linker, a basic amino acid and a small hydrophobic
side chain. Antibacterial activity is revealed for a number of derivatives down
to an MIC of 2 μg/mL (2 μM) against Staphylococcus aureus--comparable to
vancomycin, and an MIC of 31 μg/mL (31 μM) against some vancomycin-resistant
enterococcal strains.
