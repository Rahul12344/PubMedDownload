The hide-to-beef microbial transfer-reducing effects of a novel Shellac treatment
of hides (based on "on-hair immobilization" of microorganisms) were evaluated. In
the hide-to-meat direct contact laboratory-based experiments, treatment of hides 
(of varying visual cleanliness) with Shellac produced significant microbial
reductions on beef: up to 3.6 log(10) CFU/cm(2) of total viable count of bacteria
(TVC), up to 2.5 log(10) CFU/cm(2) of Enterobacteriaceae (EC) and up to 1.7
log(10) CFU/cm(2) of generic Escherichia coli (GEC). In a small commercial
abattoir under "bad-case" conditions (slaughtering dirty cattle, inadequate
process hygiene), treatment of hides with Shellac produced significant microbial 
reductions on beef carcasses: 1.7 log(10) CFU/cm(2), 1.4 log(10) CFU/cm(2) and
1.3 log(10) CFU/cm(2) of TVC, EC and GEC, respectively. In both laboratory- and
abattoir-based trials, TVC reductions on beef achieved by the Shellac hide
treatment were superior to those achieved by the comparative sanitizer
rinse-vacuum hide treatment, but reductions of EC and GEC did not differ
significantly between the two hide treatments.
