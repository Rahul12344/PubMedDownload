[Role of additional substrates in DDT degradation by cultures of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa].

[Article in Russian]

Mal'tseva OV, Golovleva LA.

The activity of enzymes was compared during Pseudomonas aeruginosa 640x growth on
compounds activating DDT to a different degree and on acetate which did not
stimulate this process. The activity of dehydrogenases generating reduced
cofactors necessary for DDT dechlorination was found to be much higher on
effective additional substrates than on compounds which either had no effect on
DDT degradation or stimulated this process only slightly. The activity of enzymes
generating the reduced cofactors was shown to correlate with the extent of DDT
degradation by this culture.
