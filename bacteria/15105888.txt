The purpose of this study was to assess the weathering of finely ground
phlogopite, a trioctahedral mica, by placing it in contact with heterotrophic
(Bacillus cereus) and acidophilic (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) cultures.
X-ray diffraction analyses of the phlogopite sample before and after 24 weeks of 
contact in B. cereus cultures revealed a decrease in the characteristic peak
intensities of phlogopite, indicating destruction of individual structural planes
of the mica. No new solid phase products or interlayer structures were detected
in B. cereus cultures. Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans cultures enhanced the
chemical dissolution of the mineral and formed partially weathered interlayer
structures, where interlayer K was expelled and coupled with the precipitation of
K-jarosite [KFe3(SO4)2(OH)6].
