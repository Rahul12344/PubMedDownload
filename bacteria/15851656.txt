Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) interaction with intercellular
adhesion molecules (ICAMs) facilitates T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated
killing. To dissect TCR and LFA-1 contributions, we evaluated cytolytic activity 
and granule release by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) as well as intracellular
granule redistribution and morphology of CTL stimulated with natural TCR ligand
in the presence or absence of LFA-1 engagement. Although other adhesion
mechanisms, e.g., CD2-CD58 interaction, could substitute for LFA-1 to trigger CTL
degranulation, productive LFA-1 ligation was indispensable for effective target
cell lysis by the released granules. LFA-1-mediated adhesion to glass-supported
bilayers containing intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was characterized by a much
larger junction area, marked by LFA-1 segregation, and a more compact cell shape 
compared with those observed for CD2-mediated adhesion to bilayers containing
CD58. A larger contact induced by intercellular adhesion molecule 1 determined a 
unique positioning of granules near the interface. These data provide evidence
that LFA-1 delivers a distinct signal essential for directing released cytolytic 
granules to the surface of antigen-bearing target cells to mediate the effective 
destruction of these cells by CTL.
