This survey was conducted to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline
against 50 isolates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii.
Isolates of A. baumannii were resistant to ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol,
imipenem, levofloxacin, piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but were always
susceptible to colistin. MICs of tigecycline were determined by E-test in
Mueller-Hinton agar. The results of the study showed that 50% of the A. baumannii
strains were susceptible to tigecycline.
