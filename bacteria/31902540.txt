Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based typings of HLA-A, B, C, DQB1 and DRB1 loci
were performed from 2018 to 2019 in 23 595 newly recruited or re-typed adult
potential bone marrow donors registered in Poltransplant Registry to characterize
allele and haplotype frequencies of HLA system for loci important for
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The donors were recruited for registry
and not for any other purpose including controls in a disease association study. 
The population sample was collected in various regions of Poland including all
voivodships. The data regarding the degree of relatedness among individuals in
the sample were not collected. Typings were supported by public funds as a part
of the Polish National Program for Transplant Medicine Development. HLA frequency
data are available in the Allele Frequencies Net Database.
