OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate changes in the
expression of angiogenesis-related genes during the common terminal pathway of
parturition including spontaneous labor at term, as well as preterm labor (PTL), 
induced by either bacteria or ovariectomy.
STUDY DESIGN: Preterm pregnant mice (14.5 days of gestation) were treated with
the following: (1) intrauterine injection of media; (2) intrauterine injection of
heat-inactivated Escherichia coli; (3) ovariectomy; and (4) sham operation.
Tissues from mice at term (19.5 days of gestation) were collected at term not in 
labor, term in labor, and 12 hours postpartum. Angiogenesis-related gene
expression levels were quantitated by the measurement of specific mRNAs in
uterine tissue by RT-qPCR and analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: The following results were found: (1) microarray analysis of the uterine
transcriptome indicated an enrichment for the gene ontology category of
angiogenesis in bacteria-induced PTL samples (P < or = .093); (2) several genes
related to angiogenesis demonstrated significantly increased expression in
samples in either term spontaneous labor or preterm labor; and (3) qRT-PCR
measurements demonstrated that spontaneous term labor and preterm labor induced
by either bacteria or ovariectomy all substantially increased the expression of
multiple angiogenesis-related genes (P < or = .0003; Angpt2, Ctgf, Cyr61, Dscr1, 
Pgf, Serpine1, Thbs1, and Wisp 1).
CONCLUSION: Spontaneous labor at term, as well as pathologically induced preterm 
labor, all result in greatly increased expression of angiogenesis-related genes
in the uterus.
