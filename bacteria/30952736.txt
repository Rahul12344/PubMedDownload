BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal mucositis occurs in virtually all patients with head
and neck cancer receiving radiochemotherapy. The manipulation of the oral cavity 
microbiota represents an intriguing and challenging target.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 patients were enrolled to receive
Lactobacillus brevis CD2 lozenges or oral care regimen with sodium bicarbonate
mouthwashes. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 3 or 4 oropharyngeal
mucositis during radiotherapy treatment.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the incidence of grade 3-4
oropharyngeal mucositis between the intervention and control groups (40.6% vs.
41.6% respectively, p=0.974). The incidence of pain, dysphagia, body weight loss 
and quality of life were not different between the experimental and standard arm.
CONCLUSION: Our study was not able to demonstrate the efficacy of L. brevis CD2
lozenges in preventing radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck
cancer. Although modulating homeostasis of the salivary microbiota in the oral
cavity seems attractive, it clearly needs further study.
