Recognition of virally infected cells by CD8+ T cells requires differentiation
between self and nonself peptide-class I major histocompatibility complexes
(pMHC). Recognition of foreign pMHC by host T cells is a major factor in the
rejection of transplanted organs from the same species (allotransplant) or
different species (xenotransplant). AHIII12.2 is a murine T cell clone that
recognizes the xenogeneic (human) class I MHC HLA-A2.1 molecule (A2) and the
syngeneic murine class I MHC H-2 D(b) molecule (D(b)). Recognition of both A2 and
D(b) are peptide-dependent, and the sequences of the peptides recognized have
been determined. Alterations in the antigenic peptides bound to A2 cause large
changes in AHIII12.2 T cell responsiveness. Crystal structures of three
representative peptides (agonist, null, and antagonist) bound to A2 partially
explain the changes in AHIII12.2 responsiveness. Using class I pMHC octamers, a
strong correlation is seen between T cell activity and the affinity of pMHC
complexes for the T cell receptor. However, contrary to previous studies, we see 
similar half-lives for the pMHC multimers bound to the AHIII12.2 cell surface.
