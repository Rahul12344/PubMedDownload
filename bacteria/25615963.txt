HU proteins belong to the nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) that are involved
in vital processes such as DNA compaction and reparation, gene transcription etc.
No data are available on the structures of HU proteins from mycoplasmas. To this 
end, the HU protein from the parasitic mycoplasma Spiroplasma melliferum KC3 was 
cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Prismatic 
crystals of the protein were obtained by the vapour-diffusion technique at 4°C.
The crystals diffracted to 1.36 Å resolution (the best resolution ever obtained
for a HU protein). The diffraction data were indexed in space group C2 and the
structure of the protein was solved by the molecular-replacement method with one 
monomer per asymmetric unit.
