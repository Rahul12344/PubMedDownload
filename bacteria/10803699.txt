In this study, we tested the hypothesis that decreased cerebral perfusion
pressure (CPP) induces cerebral ischemia and worsen brain damage in neonatal
bacterial meningitis. Meningitis was induced by intracisternal injection of 10(9)
colony forming units of Escherichia coli in 21 newborn piglets. Although CPP
decreased significantly at 8 hr after bacterial inoculation, deduced hemoglobin
(HbD), measured as an index of changes in cerebral blood flow by near infrared
spectroscopy, did not decrease significantly. In correlation analyses, CPP showed
significant positive correlation with brain ATP and inverse correlation with
brain lactate levels. CPP also correlated positively with HbD and oxidized
cytochrome aa3 (Cyt aa3) by near infrared spectroscopy. However, CPP did not show
significant correlation with cerebral cortical cell membrane Na+,K+-ATPase
activity, nor with levels of lipid peroxidation products. In summary, decreased
CPP observed in this study failed to induce cerebral ischemia and further brain
injury, indicating that cerebrovascular autoregulation is intact during the early
phase of experimental neonatal bacterial meningitis.
