Human beta defensin 2 (HBD-2), the most recently discovered human defensin, has
been considered to work as a host defense substance against microbial infection. 
Using Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, we investigated how some cations and anions
influenced the antimicrobial activity of HBD-2. This activity, measured in 10 mM 
phosphate buffer at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, reduced significantly in the
presence of 100 and 150 mM sodium or potassium chloride. The reduction was not
significantly different when the total amounts of sodium and potassium ions were 
equal. The kind and the valence of anions (chlorine and sulfate ions) did not
affect the bactericidal activity as long as the concentrations of sodium ions
were equal. Divalent ions (calcium and magnesium ions) added to 10 mM of Tris
buffer significantly inactivated HBD-2 at much lower concentrations (more than or
equal to 0.01 mM and 0.05 mM, respectively) than the monovalent ions did. These
findings suggest that HBD-2 kills the bacteria through at least two phases, which
are affected independently by either monovalent or divalent ions and unaffected
by anions.
