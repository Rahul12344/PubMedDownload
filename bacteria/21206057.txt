The CsgC protein is a component of the curli system in Escherichia coli. Reported
here is the successful incorporation of selenocysteine (SeCys) and
selenomethionine (SeMet) into recombinant CsgC, yielding derivatized crystals
suitable for structural determination. Unlike in previous reports, a standard
autotrophic expression strain was used and only single-wavelength anomalous
dispersion (SAD) data were required for successful phasing. The level of
SeCys/SeMet incorporation was estimated by mass spectrometry to be about 80%. The
native protein crystallized in two different crystal forms (form 1 belonging to
space group C222(1) and form 2 belonging to space group C2), which diffracted to 
2.4 and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively, whilst Se-derivatized protein
crystallized in space group C2 and diffracted to 1.7 Å resolution. The
Se-derivatized crystals are suitable for SAD structure determination using only
the anomalous signal derived from the SeCys residues. These results extend the
usability of SeCys labelling to more general and less favourable cases, rendering
it a suitable alternative to traditional phasing approaches.
