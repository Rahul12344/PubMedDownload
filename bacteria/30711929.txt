BACKGROUND/AIM: Invariant natural killer T-cells (iNKT) stimulated by
CD1d-binding glycolipids have been shown to exert antitumor effects by a number
of studies in a mouse model. Breast cancer is a devastating disease, with
different types of breast cancer recurring locally or distant as
metastatic/advanced disease following initial treatment. The aim of this study
was to examine the tumoricidal effect of a CD1d-binding glycolipid, called
7DW8-5, against a highly invasive human breast cancer cell line both in vitro and
in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parental MDA-MB-231 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells transduced 
with human CD1d were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE), followed by loading with glycolipids. After co-culturing with human iNKT 
cells, the cells were permeabilized and stained with Alexa Flour 647-conjugated
antibody to active caspase-3, and analyzed using a BD LSR II. For the in vivo
tumoricidal effect, MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with human CD1d and luciferase
genes were injected into the mammary fat pad of female NOD/SCID/IL2rγnull (NSG)
mice, followed by the injection of human iNKT cells with or without 7DW8-5, and
the levels of luminescence were analyzed with whole-body imaging.
RESULTS: Human iNKT cells could kill CD1d-expressing human breast cancer cells in
vitro in the presence of 7DW8-5, but not α-GalCer. As for in vivo, the adoptive
transfer of human iNKT cells into tumor-challenged NSG mice significantly
inhibited the growth of CD1d+ MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in the
presence of 7DW8-5.
CONCLUSION: CD1d-binding, glycolipid-based iNKT-cell therapy is suggested as a
potent and effective treatment against breast cancer in humans.
