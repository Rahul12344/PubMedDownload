Biomaterial surfaces may be modified to reduce bacterial adhesion. The
susceptibility in mice to Staphylococcus epidermidis infection in tissue
surrounding the commonly used catheter materials-silicon elastomer (SE),
polyamide (PA), and their surface-modified polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-grafted
derivatives, SE-PVP and PA-PVP, respectively-was assessed. Abscesses developed
around SE-PVP. Around SE, PA, and PA-PVP catheters, no signs of infection were
observed, although mice carrying PA-PVP developed septicemia after 14-21 days. S.
epidermidis was cultured from the tissue surrounding PA-PVP segments. Cells
around PA-PVP segments containing large numbers of bacteria were identified as
macrophages by use of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. This
persistence of intracellular bacteria was also observed around SE-PVP, SE, and PA
catheters, although to a lesser extent. The cytokine profiles around the 4
materials were different. Implanted biomaterial induces an inflammatory response 
favorable to the persistence of S. epidermidis. Intracellular persistence of
bacteria inside macrophages may be a pivotal process in the pathogenesis of
biomaterial-associated infection.
