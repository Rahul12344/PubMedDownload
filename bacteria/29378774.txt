Intestinal homeostasis relies on a continuous dialogue between the commensal
bacteria and the immune system. Natural killer T (NKT) cells, which recognize
CD1d-restricted microbial lipids and self-lipids, contribute to the regulation of
mucosal immunity, yet the mechanisms underlying their functions remain poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate that NKT cells respond to intestinal lipids and 
CD11c+ cells (including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages) are essential to
mediate lipid presentation within the gut ultimately controlling intestinal NKT
cell homeostasis and activation. Conversely, CD1d and NKT cells participate in
the control of the intestinal bacteria composition and compartmentalization, in
the regulation of the IgA repertoire and in the induction of regulatory T cells
within the gut. These changes in intestinal homeostasis require CD1d expression
on DC/macrophage populations as mice with conditional deletion of CD1d on CD11c+ 
cells exhibit dysbiosis and altered immune homeostasis. These results unveil the 
importance of CD11c+ cells in controlling lipid-dependent immunity in the
intestinal compartment and reveal an NKT cell-DC crosstalk as a key mechanism for
the regulation of gut homeostasis.
