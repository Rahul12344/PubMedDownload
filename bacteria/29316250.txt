Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the most refractory subtype of breast
cancer to current treatments, accounts disproportionately for the majority of
breast cancer-related deaths. This is largely due to cancer plasticity and the
development of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recently, distinct yet interconvertible 
mesenchymal-like and epithelial-like states have been revealed in breast CSCs.
Thus, strategies capable of simultaneously inhibiting bulk and CSC populations in
both mesenchymal and epithelial states have yet to be developed. Wnt/β-catenin
and Hippo/YAP pathways are crucial in tumorigenesis, but importantly also possess
tumor suppressor functions in certain contexts. One possibility is that TNBC
cells in epithelial or mesenchymal state may differently affect Wnt/β-catenin and
Hippo/YAP signaling and CSC phenotypes. In this report, we found that YAP
signaling and CD44high /CD24-/low CSCs were upregulated while Wnt/β-catenin
signaling and ALDH+ CSCs were downregulated in mesenchymal-like TNBC cells, and
vice versa in their epithelial-like counterparts. Dual knockdown of YAP and
Wnt/β-catenin, but neither alone, was required for effective suppression of both 
CD44high /CD24-/low and ALDH+ CSC populations in mesenchymal and epithelial TNBC 
cells. These observations were confirmed with cultured tumor fragments prepared
from patients with TNBC after treatment with Wnt inhibitor ICG-001 and YAP
inhibitor simvastatin. In addition, a clinical database showed that decreased
gene expression of Wnt and YAP was positively correlated with decreased ALDH and 
CD44 expression in patients' samples while increased patient survival.
Furthermore, tumor growth of TNBC cells in either epithelial or mesenchymal state
was retarded, and both CD44high /CD24-/low and ALDH+ CSC subpopulations were
diminished in a human xenograft model after dual administration of ICG-001 and
simvastatin. Tumorigenicity was also hampered after secondary transplantation.
These data suggest a new therapeutic strategy for TNBC via dual Wnt and YAP
inhibition.
