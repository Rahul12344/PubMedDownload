Human pluripotent stem cells, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold promise as novel therapeutic 
tools for diabetes treatment because of their self-renewal capacity and ability
to differentiate into beta (β)-cells. Small and large molecules play important
roles in each stage of β-cell differentiation from both hESCs and hiPSCs. The
small and large molecules that are described in this review have significantly
advanced efforts to cure diabetic disease. Lately, effective protocols have been 
implemented to induce hESCs and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to
differentiate into functional β-cells. Several small molecules, proteins, and
growth factors promote pancreatic differentiation from hESCs and hMSCs. These
small molecules (e.g., cyclopamine, wortmannin, retinoic acid, and sodium
butyrate) and large molecules (e.g. activin A, betacellulin, bone morphogentic
protein (BMP4), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), noggin,
transforming growth factor (TGF-α), and WNT3A) are thought to contribute from the
initial stages of definitive endoderm formation to the final stages of maturation
of functional endocrine cells. We discuss the importance of such small and large 
molecules in uniquely optimized protocols of β-cell differentiation from stem
cells. A global understanding of various small and large molecules and their
functions will help to establish an efficient protocol for β-cell
differentiation.
