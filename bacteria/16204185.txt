This paper shows that the small RNA MicA (previously SraD) is an antisense
regulator of ompA in Escherichia coli. MicA accumulates upon entry into
stationary phase and down-regulates the level of ompA mRNA. Regulation of ompA
(outer membrane protein A), previously attributed to Hfq/mRNA binding, is lost
upon deletion of the micA gene, whereas overexpression of MicA inhibits the
synthesis of OmpA. In vitro, MicA binds to the ompA mRNA leader. Enzymatic and
chemical probing was used to map the structures of MicA, the ompA mRNA leader,
and the complex formed upon binding. MicA binding generates a footprint across
the ompA Shine-Dalgarno sequence, consistent with a 12 + 4 base-pair interaction,
which is additionally supported by the effect of mutations in vivo and by
bioinformatics analysis of enterobacterial micA/ompA homolog sequences. MicA is
conserved in many enterobacteria, as is its ompA target site. In vitro
toeprinting confirmed that binding of MicA specifically interferes with ribosome 
binding. We propose that MicA, when present at high levels, blocks ribosome
binding at the ompA translation start site, which-in line with previous
work-secondarily facilitates RNase E cleavage and subsequent mRNA decay. MicA
requires the presence of the Hfq protein, although the mechanistic basis for this
remains unclear.
