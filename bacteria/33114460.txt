Understanding the importance of oral microbiota in human health and disease also 
leads to an expansion of the knowledge on functional, metabolic, and molecular
alterations directly contributing to oral and systemic pathologies. To date, a
compelling number of studies have documented the crucial role of some oral
cavity-occurring microbes in the initiation and progression of cancers. Although 
this effect was noted primarily for Fusobacterium spp., the potential impact of
other oral microbes is also worthy of investigation. In this study, we aimed to
assess the effect of Enterococcus faecalis, Actinomyces odontolyticus, and
Propionibacterium acnes on the proliferation capability and mechanical features
of gingival cells and cell lines derived from lung, breast, and ovarian cancers. 
For this purpose, we incubated selected cell lines with heat-inactivated bacteria
and supernatants collected from biofilms, cultured in both anaerobic and aerobic 
conditions, in the presence of surgically removed teeth and human saliva. The
effect of oral bacteria on cell population growth is variable, with the highest
growth-promoting abilities observed for E. faecalis in relation to human primary 
gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and lung cancer A549 cells, and P. acnes in relation
to breast cancer MCF-7 and ovarian cancer SKOV-3 cells. Notably, this effect
seems to depend on a delicate balance between the pro-stimulatory and toxic
effects of bacterial-derived products. Regardless of the diverse effect of
bacterial products on cellular proliferation capability, we observed significant 
alterations in stiffness of gingival and lung cancer cells stimulated with E.
faecalis bacteria and corresponding biofilm supernatants, suggesting a novel
molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in oral cavities and
tooth tissues. Accordingly, it is proposed that analysis of cancerogenic features
of oral cavity bacteria should be multivariable and should include investigation 
of potential alterations in cell mechanical properties. These findings
corroborate the important role of oral hygiene and root canal treatment to assure
the healthy stage of oral microbiota.
