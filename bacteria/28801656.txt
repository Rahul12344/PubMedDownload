T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous
disease that can be classified into different molecular genetic subtypes
according to their mRNA gene expression profile. In this study, we applied RNA
sequencing to investigate the full spectrum of miRNA expression in primary T-ALL 
patient samples, T-ALL leukemia cell lines and healthy donor thymocytes. Notably,
this analysis revealed that genetic subtypes of human T-ALL also display unique
miRNA expression signatures, which are largely conserved in human T-ALL cell
lines with corresponding genetic background. Furthermore, small RNA-sequencing
also unraveled the variety of isoforms that are expressed for each miRNA in T-ALL
and showed that a significant number of miRNAs are actually represented by an
alternative isomiR. Finally, comparison of CD34+ and CD4+CD8+ healthy donor
thymocytes and T-ALL miRNA profiles allowed identifying several novel miRNAs with
putative oncogenic or tumor suppressor functions in T-ALL. Altogether, this study
provides a comprehensive overview of miRNA expression in normal and malignant
T-cells and sets the stage for functional evaluation of novel miRNAs in T-ALL
disease biology.
