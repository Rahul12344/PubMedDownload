BACKGROUND: Myanmar cattle populations predominantly consist of native cattle
breeds (Pyer Sein and Shwe), characterized by their geographical location and
coat color, and the Holstein-Friesian crossbreed, which is highly adapted to the 
harsh tropical climates of this region. Here, we analyzed the diversity and
genetic structure of the BoLA-DRB3 gene, a genetic locus that has been linked to 
the immune response, in Myanmar cattle populations.
METHODS: Blood samples (n = 294) were taken from two native breeds (Pyer Sein,
n = 163 and Shwe Ni, n = 69) and a cattle crossbreed (Holstein-Friesian, n = 62) 
distributed across six regions of Myanmar (Bago, n = 38; Sagaing, n = 77;
Mandalay, n = 46; Magway, n = 46; Kayin, n = 43; Yangon, n = 44). In addition, a 
database that included 2428 BoLA-DRB3 genotypes from European (Angus, Hereford,
Holstein, Shorthorn, Overo Negro, Overo Colorado, and Jersey), Zebuine (Nellore, 
Brahman and Gir), Asian Native from Japan and Philippine and Latin-American
Creole breeds was also included. Furthermore, the information from the IPD-MHC
database was also used in the present analysis. DNA was genotyped using the
sequence-based typing method. DNA electropherograms were analyzed using the
Assign 400ATF software.
RESULTS: We detected 71 distinct alleles, including three new variants for the
BoLA-DRB3 gene. Venn analysis showed that 11 of these alleles were only detected 
in Myanmar native breeds and 26 were only shared with Asian native and/or Zebu
groups. The number of alleles ranged from 33 in Holstein-Friesians to 58 in Pyer 
Seins, and the observed versus unbiased expected heterozygosity were higher than 
0.84 in all the three the populations analyzed. The FST analysis showed a low
level of genetic differentiation between the two Myanmar native breeds
(FST = 0.003), and between these native breeds and the Holstein-Friesians
(FST <  0.021). The average FST value for all the Myanmar Holstein-Friesian
crossbred and Myanmar native populations was 0.0136 and 0.0121, respectively.
Principal component analysis (PCA) and tree analysis showed that Myanmar native
populations grouped in a narrow cluster that diverged clearly from the
Holstein-Friesian populations. Furthermore, the BoLA-DRB3 allele frequencies
suggested that while some Myanmar native populations from Bago, Mandalay and
Yangon regions were more closely related to Zebu breeds (Gir and Brahman),
populations from Kayin, Magway and Sagaing regions were more related to the
Philippines native breeds. On the contrary, PCA showed that the Holstein-Friesian
populations demonstrated a high degree of dispersion, which is likely the result 
of the different degrees of native admixture in these populations.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to report the genetic diversity of the
BoLA-DRB3 gene in two native breeds and one exotic cattle crossbreed from
Myanmar. The results obtained contribute to our understanding of the genetic
diversity and distribution of BoLA-DRB3 gene alleles in Myanmar, and increases
our knowledge of the worldwide variability of cattle BoLA-DRB3 genes, an
important locus for immune response and protection against pathogens.
