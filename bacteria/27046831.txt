Intestinal tumorigenesis is a result of mutations in signaling pathways that
control cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway are associated with the majority of intestinal cancers,
while dysregulation of the Hippo/Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) pathway is an
emerging regulator of intestinal tumorigenesis. In addition, these closely
related pathways play a central role during intestinal regeneration. We have
previously shown that methylation of the Hippo transducer YAP by the lysine
methyltransferase SETD7 controls its subcellular localization and function. We
now show that SETD7 is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis and
regeneration. Mechanistically, SETD7 is part of a complex containing YAP, AXIN1, 
and β-catenin, and SETD7-dependent methylation of YAP facilitates Wnt-induced
nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Collectively, these results define a
methyltransferase-dependent regulatory mechanism that links the Wnt/β-catenin and
Hippo/YAP pathways during intestinal regeneration and tumorigenesis.
