OBJECTIVE: To explore the effectiveness, biosafety, photobleaching and mechanism 
of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) using methylene blue (MB) plus
potassium iodide (KI), for root canal infections.
METHODS: Different combinations and concentrations of MB, KI and 660 nm LED light
were used against E. faecalis in planktonic and in biofilm states by
colony-forming unit (CFU), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were used for safety 
testing by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and fluorescence microscopy (FLM). The
photobleaching effect and mechanisms were analyzed.
RESULTS: KI could not only enhance MB aPDT on E. faecalis in both planktonic and 
biofilm states even in a hypoxic environment, but also produced a long-lasting
bactericidal effect after end of the illumination. KI could accelerate
photobleaching to reduce tooth staining by MB, and the mixture was harmless for
HGFs. Mechanistic studies showed the generation of hydrogen peroxide and free
iodine, and iodine radicals may be formed in hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: aPDT with MB plus KI could be used for root canal disinfection and
clinical studies are worth pursuing.
