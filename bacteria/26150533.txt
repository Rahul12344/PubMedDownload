The vast majority of IgA production occurs in mucosal tissue following T
cell-dependent and T cell-independent Ag responses. To study the nature of each
of these responses, we analyzed the gene-expression and Ig-reactivity profiles of
T cell-dependent CD27(+)IgA(+) and T cell-independent CD27(-)IgA(+) circulating
memory B cells. Gene-expression profiles of IgA(+) subsets were highly similar to
each other and to IgG(+) memory B cell subsets, with typical upregulation of
activation markers and downregulation of inhibitory receptors. However, we
identified the mucosa-associated CCR9 and RUNX2 genes to be specifically
upregulated in CD27(-)IgA(+) B cells. We also found that CD27(-)IgA(+) B cells
expressed Abs with distinct Ig repertoire and reactivity compared with those from
CD27(+)IgA(+) B cells. Indeed, Abs from CD27(-)IgA(+) B cells were weakly
mutated, often used Igλ chain, and were enriched in polyreactive clones
recognizing various bacterial species. Hence, T cell-independent IgA responses
are likely involved in the maintenance of gut homeostasis through the production 
of polyreactive mutated IgA Abs with cross-reactive anti-commensal reactivity.
