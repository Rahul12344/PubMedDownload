Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial
compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus
megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here
we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of
OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent 
S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain
phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine
phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen
atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically
characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis
of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of
enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members. Overall, this work provides a framework 
for understanding the interplay of AdoMet and Cbl cofactors and expands the
catalytic repertoire of Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzymes.
