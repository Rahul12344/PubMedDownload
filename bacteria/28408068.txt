Chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of myriad complications
associated with diabetes and thus anti-inflammatory therapies may ameliorate
these complications. Quercus infectoria (Qi) extract has been shown to
downregulate inflammatory processes; however, the molecular mechanisms of this
anti-inflammatory activity remain unclear. The hypothesis of our study was that
Qi extract exerts its anti-inflammatory effect by downregulating the Set7/NF-κB
pathway. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were treated with high glucose
plus palmitate medium (HG/Pa) to simulate the diabetic environment. Compared with
control conditions, HG/Pa elevated expression Set7, expression and activity of
NF-κB along with expression of several inflammatory cytokines. These changes were
associated with increased levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). 
Moreover, similar alterations were demonstrated in BMM derived from mice fed a
high fat diet (HFD) compared to those from lean mice, suggesting that HFD-induced
changes in BM progenitors persist throughout differentiation and culture.
Importantly, Qi extract dose-dependently reduced Set7, p65 and inflammatory
cytokine expression relative to vehicle controls in both HG/Pa-and HFD-treated
BMM. Finally, macrophages/monocytes isolated from wounds of diabetic mice that
were treated with Qi solution exhibited lower expression of the inflammatory
cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, compared with vehicle treated wounds, demonstrating
translation to the in vivo diabetic environment. Taken together, data from this
study suggests that Qi downregulates diabetes-induced activity of the Set7/NF-kB 
pathway.
