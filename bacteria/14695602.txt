Recent progress in fundamental studies on multiporphyrin arrays has provided
structural parameters for the molecular design of artificial light-harvesting
antennae which mimic the wheel-like antenna complexes of photosynthetic purple
bacteria. Covalent and noncovalent approaches have been employed for the
construction of artificial light-harvesting multiporphyrin arrays. Such arrays
are categorized into ring-shaped, windmill-shaped, star-shaped, and dendritic
architectures. In particular, dendritic multiporphyrin arrays have been proven to
be promising candidates for both providing a large absorption cross-section and
enabling the vectorial transfer of energy over a long distance to a designated
point. Such molecular and supramolecular systems are also expected to be potent
components for molecular electronics and photonic devices.
