Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are natural inhibitors of matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs), enzymes that contribute to cancer and many
inflammatory and degenerative diseases. The TIMP N-terminal domain binds and
inhibits an MMP catalytic domain, but the role of the TIMP C-terminal domain in
MMP inhibition is poorly understood. Here, we employed yeast surface display for 
directed evolution of full-length human TIMP-1 to develop MMP-3-targeting
ultrabinders. By simultaneously incorporating diversity into both domains, we
identified TIMP-1 variants that were up to 10-fold improved in binding MMP-3
compared with WT TIMP-1, with inhibition constants (Ki ) in the low picomolar
range. Analysis of individual and paired mutations from the selected TIMP-1
variants revealed cooperative effects between distant residues located on the N- 
and C-terminal TIMP domains, positioned on opposite sides of the interaction
interface with MMP-3. Crystal structures of MMP-3 complexes with TIMP-1 variants 
revealed conformational changes in TIMP-1 near the cooperative mutation sites.
Affinity was strengthened by cinching of a reciprocal "tyrosine clasp" formed
between the N-terminal domain of TIMP-1 and proximal MMP-3 interface and by
changes in secondary structure within the TIMP-1 C-terminal domain that stabilize
interdomain interactions and improve complementarity to MMP-3. Our protein
engineering and structural studies provide critical insight into the cooperative 
function of TIMP domains and the significance of peripheral TIMP epitopes in MMP 
recognition. Our findings suggest new strategies to engineer TIMP proteins for
therapeutic applications, and our directed evolution approach may also enable
exploration of functional domain interactions in other protein systems.
