The oxidation resistance gene 1 (OXR1) is crucial for protecting against
oxidative stress; however, its molecular function is unknown. We employed RNA
sequencing to examine the role of human OXR1 for genome wide transcription
regulation. In total, in non-treated and hydrogen peroxide exposed HeLa cells,
OXR1 depletion resulted in down-regulation of 554 genes and up-regulation of 253 
genes. These differentially expressed genes include transcription factors (i.e.
HIF1A, SP6, E2F8 and TCF3), antioxidant genes (PRDX4, PTGS1 and CYGB) and
numerous genes of the p53 signaling pathway involved in cell-cycle arrest (i.e.
cyclin D, CDK6 and RPRM) and apoptosis (i.e. CytC and CASP9). We demonstrated
that OXR1 depleted cells undergo cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase during oxidative
stress and increase protein expression of the apoptosis initiator protease CASP9.
In summary, OXR1 may act as a sensor of cellular oxidative stress to regulate the
transcriptional networks required to detoxify reactive oxygen species and
modulate cell cycle and apoptosis.
