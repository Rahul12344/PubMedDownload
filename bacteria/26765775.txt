BACKGROUND/AIMS: ALKBH1, an AlkB homologue in the 2-oxoglutarate and Fe2+
dependent hydroxylase family, is a histone dioxygenase that removes methyl groups
from histone H2A. Studies of transgenic mice lacking Alkbh1 reveal that most
Alkbh1-/- embryos die during embryonic development. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
derived from these mice have prolonged expression of pluripotency markers and
delayed induction of genes involved in neural differentiation, indicating that
ALKBH1 is involved in regulation of pluripotency and differentiation. The aim of 
this study was to further investigate the role ALKBH1 in early development.
METHODS: Double-filter methods for nitrocellulose-filter binding, dot blot,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immonocytochemistry, cell culture and 
differentiation of mouse ESCs, Co-IP and miRNA analysis.
RESULTS: We found that SOX2 and NANOG bind the ALKBH1 promoter, and we identified
protein-protein interactions between ALKBH1 and these core transcription factors 
of the pluripotency network. Furthermore, lack of ALKBH1 affected the expression 
of developmentally important miRNAs, which are involved in the regulation of
NANOG, SOX2 and neural differentiation.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ALKBH1 interacts with the core
transcriptional pluripotency network of ESCs and is involved in regulation of
pluripotency and differentiation.
