Although bacterial iterative type I polyketide synthases are now known to
participate in the biosynthesis of a small set of diverse natural products, the
subsequent downstream modification of the resulting polyketide products is poorly
understood. We report the functional characterization of the putative orsellinic 
acid C2-O-methyltransferase, which is involved in calicheamicin biosynthesis.
This study suggests that C2-O-methylation precedes C3-hydroxylation/methylation
and C5-iodination and requires a coenzyme A- or acyl carrier protein-bound
substrate.
