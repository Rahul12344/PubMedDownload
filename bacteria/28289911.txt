The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, multiple drug-resistance, and
extremely drug-resistant strains demonstrates the need for improved strategies to
discover new drug-based compounds. The development of transcriptomics,
proteomics, and metabolomics has provided new tools for global studies of living 
organisms. However, the compendium of expression profiles produced by these
methods has introduced new scientific challenges into antimicrobial research. In 
this review, we discuss the practical value of transcriptomic techniques as well 
as their difficulties and pitfalls. We advocate the construction of new databases
of transcriptomic data, using standardized formats in addition to standardized
models of bacterial and yeast similar to those used in systems biology. The
inclusion of proteomic and metabolomic data is also essential, as the resulting
networks can provide a landscape to rationally predict and exploit new drug
targets and to understand drug synergies.
