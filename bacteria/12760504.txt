The oral epithelium is continuously exposed to a variety of microbial challenges 
that can cause infectious diseases such as periodontal disease. Human B
Defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cationic antimicrobial peptide with low molecular weight,
which is inducible from oral epithelial cells upon either bacterial infection or 
stimulation with inflammatory cytokines. This peptide has a broad antimicrobial
spectrum that includes gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi.
Therefore, it is thought that hBD-2 plays an important role as one of natural
immunities to bacterial infection. However, its activity is inhibited by body
fluids such as serum. The aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial
activity of synthetic hBD-2 against oral bacteria in the presence of saliva or
serum. The antibacterial activity of synthetic hBD-2 was tested against
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Streptococcus
mutans, and Escherichia coli. Antibacterial broth assay and diffusion assay were 
performed in vitro. The antibacterial activity of hBD-2 was approximately equal
to that of minocycline at equimolar concentrations. Furthermore, the activity of 
hBD-2 remained at 60% in the presence of 80% saliva, whereas no activity remained
in the presence of 20% serum. Our results suggest the possibility that synthetic 
hBD-2 could be useful to prevent infection by periodontal bacteria.
