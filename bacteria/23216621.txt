BACKGROUND: Activated protein C (APC) exerts anticoagulant effects via
inactivation of factors Va and VIIIa and cytoprotective effects via protease
activated receptor (PAR)1. Inhibition of endogenous APC in endotoxemia and sepsis
results in exacerbation of coagulation and inflammation, with consequent enhanced
lethality.
OBJECTIVES: We here sought to dissect the distinct roles of the anticoagulant and
cytoprotective functions of endogenous APC in severe Gram-negative
pneumonia-derived sepsis (melioidosis).
METHODS: We infected wild-type (WT) mice with Burkholderia pseudomallei, a common
sepsis pathogen in southeast Asia, and treated them with antibodies inhibiting
both the anticoagulant and cytoprotective functions of APC (MPC1609) or the
anticoagulant functions of APC (MAPC1591) only. Additionally, we administered
SEW2871 (stimulating the S1P1-pathway downstream from PAR1) to control and
MPC1609-treated mice.
RESULTS: MPC1609, but not MAPC1591, significantly worsened survival, increased
coagulation activation, facilitated bacterial growth and dissemination and
enhanced the inflammatory response. The effects of MPC1609 could not be reversed 
by SEW2871, suggesting that S1P1 does not play a major role in this model.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the mere inhibition of the anticoagulant 
function of APC does not interfere with its protective role during Gram-negative 
pneumosepsis, suggesting a more prominent role for cytoprotective effects of APC
