Resistance determinants to the toxic oxyanionic salts of arsenic and antimony are
found on plasmids of both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. In most
cases these provide resistance to both the oxyanions of +III oxidation state,
antimonite and arsenite, and the +V oxidation state, arsenate. In both
gram-positive and -negative bacteria, resistance is correlated with efflux of the
anions from cells. The determinant from the plasmid R773, isolated from a
gram-negative organism, has been studied in detail. It encodes an
oxyanion-translocating ATPase with three subunits, a catalytic subunit, the ArsA 
protein, a membrane subunit, the ArsB subunit, and a specificity factor, the ArsC
protein. The first two form a membrane-bound complex with arsenite-stimulated
ATPase activity. The determinants from gram-positive bacteria have only the arsB 
and arsC genes and encode an efflux system without the participation of an ArsA
homologue.
