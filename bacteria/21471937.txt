The compounds 1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)methyl nitrate (C1),
(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)ethyl nitrate (C2),
3-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)benzyl nitrate (C3),
4-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)-N-hydroxy-benzenesulfonamide (C4),
4-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)benzyl nitrate (C5), and
2-[4-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)phenyl]ethyl nitrate (C6) were
evaluated with a micronucleus test using mouse peripheral blood to identify new
candidate drugs for the treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD) that are safer
than hydroxyurea. The compounds induced an average frequency of micronucleated
reticulocytes (MNRET) of less than six per 1,000 cells at 12.5, 25, 50, and 100
mg/kg, whereas hydroxyurea induced an average MNRET frequency of 7.8, 9.8, 15,
and 33.7 per 1000 cells respectively, at the same concentrations. Compounds C1-C6
are new non-genotoxic in vivo candidate drugs for the treatment of SCD symptoms.
