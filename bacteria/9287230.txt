BACKGROUND: Major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) class II deficiency is an
autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disease in which MHC class II
molecules are absent. It is a genetically heterogeneous disease of gene
regulation resulting from defects in several transactivating genes that regulate 
the expression of MHC class II genes. The mutations responsible for MHC class II 
deficiency are classified according to complementation group (a group in which
the phenotype remains uncorrected in pairwise fusions of cells). There are three 
known complementation groups (A, B, and C).
METHODS: To elucidate the genetic defect in patients with MHC class II deficiency
that was not classified genetically, we performed direct complementation assays
with the three genes known to regulate the expression of MHC class II genes,
CIITA, RFX5, and RFXAP, and the relevant mutations were identified in each
patient.
RESULTS: Mutations in the RFXAP gene were found in three patients from unrelated 
families, and the resulting defect was classified as belonging to a novel
complementation group (D). Transfection with the wild-type RFXAP gene restored
the expression of MHC class II molecules in the patients' cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations in a novel MHC class II transactivating factor, RFXAP, can
cause MHC class II deficiency. These mutations abolish the expression of MHC
class II genes and lead to the same clinical picture of immunodeficiency as in
patients with mutations in the other two MHC class II regulatory genes.
