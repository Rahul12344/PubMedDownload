BACKGROUND: Fusobacterium species are pleomorphic, obligate anaerobic
gram-negative bacilli. They are difficult to culture and grow slowly. If
antibiotic treatment is initiated prior to blood cultures, the bacteria might
evade detection. This is a comprehensive report on mortality in non-bacteraemia
fusobacterial infection.
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively in adults having a positive culture 
with Fusobacterium spp. admitted during 2000-2012 at the medical department. Data
on culture specimens, number of cultures, admission and culture dates, patient
age, gender, clinical disease, Charlson's index of co-morbidity, CRP level and
survival were obtained. For comparison, we traced 60 consecutive, similarly
obtained cultures from 2009 to 2010 containing Staphylococcus aureus.
RESULTS: Within a 12-year period, we identified 28 patients with a positive
culture of Fusobacterium spp. in a medical ward serving a population of 220,000. 
Only a minority (39%) had a positive blood culture, and 54% had focus in
respiratory tract or pleura. Overall 6-month mortality was 32%, and unrelated to 
subspecies, treatment or anatomic location but significantly related to age >60
years, admission for severe, acute illness, and comorbidity, especially
metastatic malignancy. Comparison between infection with Fusobacterium spp. and
S. aureus showed that Fusobacterium spp. infections were predominantly community 
acquired, while S. aureus were both community and hospital acquired. Overall
mortality for both bacterial infections increased significantly with age and
current malignant disease. S. aureus-infected patients carried a significantly
higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our data support that Fusobacterium spp. infection is a marker for
significant, chronic disease rather than carrying a poor prognosis per se.
