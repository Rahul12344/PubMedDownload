Interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) block both replication and transcription, and 
are commonly repaired by the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. However, FA-independent
repair mechanisms of ICLs remain poorly understood. Here we report a previously
uncharacterized protein, SAN1, as a 5' exonuclease that acts independently of the
FA pathway in response to ICLs. Deletion of SAN1 in HeLa cells and mouse
embryonic fibroblasts causes sensitivity to ICLs, which is prevented by
re-expression of wild type but not nuclease-dead SAN1. SAN1 deletion causes DNA
damage and radial chromosome formation following treatment with Mitomycin C,
phenocopying defects in the FA pathway. However, SAN1 deletion is not epistatic
with FANCD2, a core FA pathway component. Unexpectedly, SAN1 binds to Senataxin
(SETX), an RNA/DNA helicase that resolves R-loops. SAN1-SETX binding is increased
by ICLs, and is required to prevent cross-link sensitivity. We propose that SAN1 
functions with SETX in a pathway necessary for resistance to ICLs.
