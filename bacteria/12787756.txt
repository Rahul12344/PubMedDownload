Natural killer (NK) cell immune responses are regulated by a balance of
activating and inhibitory signals transmitted by cell surface receptors.
Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of
inhibitory NK receptors recruit tyrosine or lipid phosphatases, which modulate
the activation signals transmitted by receptors linked to the Syk and ZAP70
tyrosine kinases and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases. In addition, recent studies 
of gene-deficient animals, in particular Syk and ZAP70 double-deficient mice,
suggest that NK cells possess a robust and potentially redundant receptor system 
to ensure their development and function.
