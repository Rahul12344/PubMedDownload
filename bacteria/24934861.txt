Pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes replicates within the host cytosol; little is
known about how it transits from cell to cell, spreading infection. A recent
study implicates infection-induced membrane damage as a trigger for
efferocytosis, the recognition and uptake of dead cells, thereby tricking
neighboring cells into taking up the invader.
