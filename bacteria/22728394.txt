Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) relaxation and diffusion correlation
measurements and imaging provide a means to non-invasively monitor gelation for
biotechnology applications. In this study, MR is used to characterize physical
gelation of three alginates with distinct chemical structures; an algal alginate,
which is not O-acetylated but contains poly guluronate (G) blocks, bacterial
alginate from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which does not have poly-G blocks, but is
O-acetylated at the C2 and/or C3 of the mannuronate residues, and alginate from a
P. aeruginosa mutant that lacks O-acetyl groups. The MR data indicate that
diffusion-reaction front gelation with Ca(2+) ions generates gels of different
bulk homogeneities dependent on the alginate structure. Shorter spin-spin T(2)
magnetic relaxation times in the alginate gels that lack O-acetyl groups indicate
stronger molecular interaction between the water and biopolymer. The data
characterize gel differences over a hierarchy of scales from molecular to system 
size.
