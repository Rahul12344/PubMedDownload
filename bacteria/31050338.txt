Ca2+-stimulated translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) to the
Golgi induces arachidonic acid production, the rate-limiting step in
pro-inflammatory eicosanoid synthesis. Structural insights into the cPLA2α
preference for phosphatidylcholine (PC)-enriched membranes have remained elusive.
Here, we report the structure of the cPLA2α C2-domain (at 2.2 Å resolution),
which contains bound 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) and Ca2+
ions. Two Ca2+ are complexed at previously reported locations in the lipid-free
C2-domain. One of these Ca2+ions, along with a third Ca2+, bridges the C2-domain 
to the DHPC phosphate group, which also interacts with Asn65. Tyr96 plays a key
role in lipid headgroup recognition via cation-π interaction with the PC
trimethylammonium group. Mutagenesis analyses confirm that Tyr96 and Asn65
function in PC binding selectivity by the C2-domain and in the regulation of
cPLA2α activity. The DHPC-binding mode of the cPLA2α C2-domain, which differs
from phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding by other
C2-domains, expands and deepens knowledge of the lipid-binding mechanisms
mediated by C2-domains.
