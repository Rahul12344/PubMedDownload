Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 1,2,4-Triazoles and 1,3,4-Oxadiazoles
Derivatives Linked to 1,4-Dihydropyridines Scaffold.

Ziaie M, Dilmaghani KA, Tukmechi A.

A series of diethyl-2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate
derivative coupled to 1,3,4-oxadiazole-5-thiones and 1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones
moieties at C2,C6 positions of 1,4-dihydropyridine ring system was prepared. This
linkage was carried out by the reaction of 1,3,4-oxadiazole-5-thiones and
1,2,4-triazole-5-thiones with
2,6-dibromomethyl-3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-4-phenyl-1,4-dihydropyridine in the
presence of potassium carbonate as a weak base and dry acetone as the solvent.
The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR
spectral data, elemental analysis and FAB-MS. The synthesized compounds were
tested for their antimicrobial and antifungal activity against Escherichia coli
and Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro in comparison with Enrofloxacin and
Amphotericin as the reference drugs which are normally used for treating such
infections. The synthetic compounds showed different inhibition zones against
tested bacteria and fungi. Compound 8d showed more antagonistic activity against 
E. coli and A. fumigatus.
