Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a recessive genetic disorder characterized by bone marrow
failure, birth defects and cancer. Cells from FA patients are particularly
defective in removing DNA interstrand crosslinks. We have developed a working
chromatography purification scheme for FANCD2, a pivotal player in the FA DNA
repair pathway, to facilitate identification of FANCD2 interacting partners. In
doing so, at least three distinct FANCD2 subcomplexes were found to be present,
designated as large, middle, and small complexes. The small complex is composed
of tetramer of FANCD2 polypeptides, which may be the building block for other
FANCD2 subcomplexes.
