Aim: To assess the effect of nonsurgical treatment on salivary hepatocyte growth 
factor (sHGF) levels in a population with periodontal disease: a
quasi-experimental study.
Methods: Eighty-one patients (aged 30-70 years) were divided into three groups
based on the gingival index, probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and
radiographic evidence of bone loss: healthy (group I), gingivitis (group II), and
chronic periodontitis (group III). Saliva samples were collected from these
groups at baseline. At 8 weeks, saliva samples were collected again from group II
and group III after the patients went through nonsurgical periodontal treatment. 
The levels of HGF were estimated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
The clinical parameters and HGF levels among all groups were analyzed using a
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS 17 version.
Results: At baseline, the highest mean HGF concentration in saliva was observed
for group III (3455.83 ± 1463.44 pg/mL), and the least in group I (469.43 ±
317.13 pg/mL). Following nonsurgical periodontal treatment, the mean HGF
concentration decreased significantly in group III and group II (p < 0.05). A
significant positive correlation between clinical parameters and HGF levels was
also seen (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: HGF concentration showed a positive correlation with the progression 
of periodontal disease.
Clinical significance: Following nonsurgical periodontal therapy, the levels of
HGF decreased significantly, suggesting that HGF could be useful for monitoring
the response to periodontal therapy.
