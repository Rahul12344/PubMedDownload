We have used a prototype small cantilever atomic force microscope to observe, in 
real time, the interactions between individual protein molecules. In particular, 
we have observed individual molecules of the chaperonin protein GroES binding to 
and then dissociating from individual GroEL proteins, which were immobilized on a
mica support. This work suggests that the small cantilever atomic force
microscope is a useful tool for studying protein dynamics at the single molecule 
level.
