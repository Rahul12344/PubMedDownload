Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are defined by their ability to regenerate a tumor upon 
transplantation. However, it is not yet clear whether tumors contain a single CSC
population or different subsets of cells with mixed capacities for initiating
primary and secondary tumors. Using two different identification strategies, we
studied the overlap between metastatic stem cells and tumor-initiating cells
(TICs) in the MMTV-PyMT model. Our results show that in the MMTV-PyMT model,
Lin-CD90-ALDHhigh cells retained a high tumor-initiating potential (TIP) in
orthotopic transplants, in contrast to Lin-CD24+CD90+, which retained higher
metastatic capacity. Interestingly, suppression of TGFβ signaling increased TIC
numbers. We here describe the existence of distinct populations of CSCs with
differing capacities to initiate tumors in the primary or the secondary site.
Inhibiting TGFβ signaling shifts the balance toward the former, which may have
unanticipated implications for the therapeutic use of TGFβ/TGFBR1 inhibitors.
