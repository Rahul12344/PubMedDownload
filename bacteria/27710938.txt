Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinases (RLCKs) in Arabidopsis play a central role in
the integration of signaling input from various growth and immune signaling
pathways. BOTRYTIS-INDUCED KINASE 1 (BIK1), belonging to the RLCK family, is an
important player in defense against bacterial and fungal pathogens and in
ethylene and brassinosteroid hormone signaling. In this study, the purification
and crystallization of a first member of the class VI family of RLCK proteins,
BIK1, are reported. BIK1 was crystallized using the microbatch-under-oil method. 
X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.35 Å resolution. The crystals belonged
to the monoclinic space group C2, with two monomers per asymmetric unit.
