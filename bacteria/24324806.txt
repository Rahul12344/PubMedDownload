During the past decade, the dual function of the immune system in tumor
inhibition and tumor progression has become appreciated. We have previously
reported that neu-specific T cells can induce rejection of neu positive mouse
mammary carcinoma (MMC) and also facilitate tumor relapse by inducing neu antigen
loss and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, we sought to determine
the mechanism by which CD8+ T cells either eliminate the tumor, or maintain tumor
cells in a dormant state and eventually facilitate tumor relapse. We show that
tumor cells that express high levels of IFN-γ Rα are eliminated by CD8+ T cells. 
In contrast, tumor cells that express low levels of IFN-γ Rα do not die but
remain dormant and quiescent in the presence of IFN-γ producing CD8+ T cells
until they hide themselves from the adaptive immune system by losing the tumor
antigen, neu. Relapsed tumor cells show CD44+CD24- phenotype with higher rates of
tumorigenesis, in vivo. Acquisition of CD44+CD24- phenotype in relapsed tumors
was not solely due to Darwinian selection. Our data suggest that tumor cells
control the outcome of tumor immune surveillance through modulation of the
expression of    IFN-γ Rα.
