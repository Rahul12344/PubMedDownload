BACKGROUND: Rhinitis is a very common disease, frequently caused by sensitisation
to inhalant allergens. Negative results from skin prick tests (SPT) and in vitro 
IgE tests generally lead to a diagnosis of non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is 
possible, as indicated by studies addressed with dust mites or pollens that the
production of specific IgE occurs exclusively at nasal level.
METHODS: We measured specific nasal IgE in children suffering from rhinitis in
the periods when Alternaria spores were present in the air. All subjects
underwent SPT with a standard panel of aeroallergens (Stallergenes, Milan, Italy)
and, in the same session, to nasal IgE test (NT). Nasal provocation test (NPT)
with Alternaria was used as reference.
RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects were included in the study. Of them, 20 (37.5%) were 
positive to SPT and 45 (80.3%) were positive to NT. In particular, 11 subjects
(19.6%) had a positive SPT and a negative NT; 36 (64.3%) had a negative SPT and a
positive NT; and 9 (16.1%) were positive to both tests. Positivity of NT and NPT 
was observed in 36 patients (69.6%), while positivity of SPT and NPT was observed
in 15 patients (26.8%). This difference was highly significant (p<0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sensitisation to Alternaria is
frequently expressed by exclusive production of specific IgE in the nasal mucosa.
Thus, measuring nasal IgE in children with rhinitis and negative SPT during the
period of presence of Alternaria spores seems helpful to avoid a mistaken
diagnosis of non-allergic rhinitis.
