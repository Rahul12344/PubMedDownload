[Effect of Borrelia--the causative agent of tick-borne relapsing fever--on the
vector].

Vasil'eva IS, Ershova AS.

Direct or indirect evidence of pathogenic effect of Borrelia sogdiana, a
tick-borne recurrent fever causative agent, on Ornithodoros papillipes is
obtained, pointing to a parasitic character of their relations. Differences
between infected and uninfected ticks are revealed both under normal life
conditions (lower survival, more intensive process of moult), as well as under
the effect of poison. Higher sensitivity of infected ticks to DDT was established
experimentally; HCCH effect was determined indirectly by counting ticks after
treatment. Authors suggest that the effect of causative agent on ticks' viability
is more expressed under the conditions close to emergency.
