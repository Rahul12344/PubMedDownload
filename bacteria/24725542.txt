INTRODUCTION: The full extent of IL-6 involvement in PVR pathophysiology has not 
yet been comprehensively investigated. The aim of this study was the comparison
of the IL-6 effect on MMP expression between SRF and the vitreous in the context 
of RRD complicated by PVR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one SRF samples from 31 eyes of 31 consecutive
patients suffering from RRD with PVR were collected during treatment by scleral
buckling. Twenty-eight vitreous samples from 28 eyes of 28 RRD patients with PVR 
were collected during surgical management with pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).
Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay was employed for the measurement of MMP-1, -3, 
-8 and TIMP-1 concentrations (in ng/ml). MMP gelatinolytic activity was
determined with the use of gelatin zymography analysis using sodium dodecyl
sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
RESULTS: Correlation analysis in the SRF revealed a significant correlation
between MMP-1/IL6 and RRD duration. Regression analysis in the SRF revealed a
significant correlation between the MMP-9/IL-6 and RRD extent. In the same fluid,
with respect to PVR grade, ANOVA revealed a significant relationship with the
proMMP-2/IL-6, MMP-2/IL6 and TIMP-1/IL-6 ratios. Graphical representation of the 
results revealed that, between the SRF and vitreous groups, significant peak
values were observed for all MMP/IL-6 and TIMP-1/IL-6 ratios included in this
study with the exception of the MMP-2/IL-6 ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: It appears that there is a significant correlation between the
presence of IL-6 and MMP/TIMP ratio in the SRF, indicating that IL-6 may
contribute to the increased MMP/TIMP ratio during PVR.
