Mast cells (MCs) are hematopoietic immune cells commonly found in adjacent to
blood vessels in the lamina propria of airway mucosa. They are important in
allergic reactions since the cross-linking of their surface high affinity
receptor FceRI induces activation of these cells, and provokes the synthesis,
degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators including arachidonic
acid-derived eicosanoids (de novo synthesized), stored enzyme mediators, and
inflammatory TH1 and TH2 cytokines, and chemokines. Interleukin (IL)-33
participates in innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation and, acting on
CD34+ cells, causes MC differentiation and maturation. IL-33 is generated by
activated immune cells, and activates MCs which degranulate and release
pro-inflammatory mediators. IL-33 is very important in mediating allergic
inflammation and can be induced by IL-1 beta. It is also called "alarmin" and is 
an inflammatory cytokine IL-1 family member, expressed from mocytes and MCs,
which binds its receptor ST2, provoking its release after cell damage. MC-derived
allergic compounds in response to IL-33 is critical to innate type 2 immunity.
IL-37 is expressed by immune and non-immune cells after pro-inflammatory
stimulus. IL-37, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, binds IL-18Ra and suppresses
pro-inflammatory IL-1 beta released by activated immune cells such as
macrophages. Here, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory IL-1 family member
cytokines released by activated MCs, mediating inflammatory allergic phenomenon, 
can be suppressed by IL-37.
