Mutants of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus that have combined
deficiencies in the cytochrome b/c1 complex and other c-type cytochromes have
been isolated. These mutants were unable to grow anaerobically in the light or
dark but could grow aerobically. Cosmids with R. capsulatus wild-type DNA that
complement the mutants have been used to construct genetic and physical maps of
the affected genes. Complementation profiles with Tn5 and mini-Mu insertions in
these cosmids and subcloned fragments from them indicated that at least three
genes (called helA, helB, and helC) are involved in the defects in cytochromes c 
biosynthesis. The genes are clustered, and helC is transcribed away from helA and
helB. Stable insertion mutants in each gene were constructed. It is postulated
that helA, helB, and helC are involved in posttranslational processing during
cytochromes c synthesis.
