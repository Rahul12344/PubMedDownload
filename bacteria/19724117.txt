Adenylosuccinate lyase (ASL) is an enzyme from the purine-biosynthetic pathway
that catalyzes the cleavage of 5-aminoimidazole-4-(N-succinylcarboxamide)
ribonucleotide (SAICAR) to 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) 
and fumarate. ASL is also responsible for the conversion of succinyladenosine
monophosphate (SAMP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fumarate. Here, the
crystal structure of adenylosuccinate lyase from Escherichia coli was determined 
to 1.9 A resolution. The enzyme adopts a substrate-bound conformation as a result
of the presence of two phosphate ions bound in the active site. Comparison with
previously solved structures of the apoenzyme and an SAMP-bound H171A mutant
reveals a conformational change at His171 associated with substrate binding and
confirms the role of this residue as a catalytic acid.
