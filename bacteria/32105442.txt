Marine microorganisms de novo biosynthesize polyunsaturated fatty acids such as
docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid by polyunsaturated fatty acid
(PUFA) synthases composed of three or four polypeptides in a manner similar to
fatty acid synthases (FASs). FASs usually possess thioesterase (TE) domains to
release free fatty acids from acyl carrier protein (ACP)-tethered intermediates. 
Here, we investigated the off-loading mechanism with microalgal and bacterial
PUFA synthases through in vivo and in vitro experiments. The in vitro experiments
with acyltransferase (AT)-like domains and acyl-ACP substrates clearly
demonstrated that the AT-like domains catalyzed the hydrolysis of acyl-ACPs to
yield free fatty acids.
