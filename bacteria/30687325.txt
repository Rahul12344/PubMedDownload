The immune response induced by Schistosma mansoni antigens is able to prevent
immune-mediated diseases. Conversely, the inflammatory response in cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL), although responsible for controlling the infection, is also
associated with the pathogenesis of disease. The aim of this study was to
evaluate the potential of the S. mansoni Sm29 antigen to change certain aspects
of the profiles of monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and lymphocytes from 
subjects with CL in vitro. Expression of surface molecules and intracellular
cytokines in the MoDCs and lymphocytes as well as the proliferation of Leishmania
braziliensis were evaluated by flow cytometry. Levels of cytokines were evaluated
in culture supernatants by ELISA. It was observed that stimulation by rSm29
increased the frequency of expression of CD83, CD80, CD86, and IL-10R in MoDCs
compared to non-stimulated cultures. Additionally rSm29 decreased the frequency
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing CD28 and increased the frequency of CD4+CD25hi
and CD4+CTLA-4+ T lymphocytes. Addition of rSm29 to cultures increased IL-10
levels and decreased levels of IL-12p40 and IFN-γ, while not altering TNF levels 
compared to non-stimulated cultures. This study showed that rSm29 induced a
regulatory profile in MoDCs and lymphocytes and thereby regulated the exaggerated
inflammation observed in CL. Considering that there are few therapeutic options
for leishmaniasis, the use of rSm29 may be an alternative to current treatment
and may be an important strategy to reduce the healing time of lesions in
patients with CL.
