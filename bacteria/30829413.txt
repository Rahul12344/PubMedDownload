The histological diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) can represent a
challenge, particularly in the case of closely related entities such as
angioimmunoblastic T-lymphoma (AITL), PTCL-not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS),
and ALK-negative anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). Although gene expression 
profiling and next generations sequencing have been proven to define specific
features recurrently associated with distinct entities, genomic-based
stratifications have not yet led to definitive diagnostic criteria and/or entered
into the routine clinical practice. Herein, to improve the current molecular
classification between AITL and PTCL-NOS, we analyzed the transcriptional
profiles from 503 PTCLs stratified according to their molecular configuration and
integrated them with genomic data of recurrently mutated genes (RHOA G17V , TET2,
IDH2 R172 , and DNMT3A) in 53 cases (39 AITLs and 14 PTCL-NOSs) included in the
series. Our analysis unraveled that the mutational status of RHOA G17V , TET2,
and DNMT3A poorly correlated, individually, with peculiar transcriptional
fingerprints. Conversely, in IDH2 R172 samples a strong transcriptional signature
was identified that could act as a surrogate for mutational status. The
integrated analysis of clinical, mutational, and molecular data led to a
simplified 19-gene signature that retains high accuracy in differentiating the
main nodal PTCL entities. The expression levels of those genes were confirmed in 
an independent cohort profiled by RNA-sequencing.
