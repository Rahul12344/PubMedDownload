In an effort to develop potent antibacterial and anticancer agents, a series of
C5'-N-cyclopropylcarboxamido-C6-amino-C2-alkynylated purine nucleoside analogues 
11a-g were synthesized through a Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction. The
nine-step synthesis is easy to perform, and employs commercially available
reagents. 2-Iodo-5'-N-cyclopropylcarboxamidoadenosine (9) was used as the
starting intermediate for the synthesis of title derivatives 11a-g. Synthetic
intermediates (2-9) and final products (11a-g) were appropriately characterized
by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. The synthesized purine nucleoside
analogues (11a-g) were evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity
against two gram-positive and two gram-negative bacteria. They were then tested
for cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 and Caco-2 cancer cell lines to determine
their anti-cancer activity. Among the tested compounds, compounds 11c and 11g
showed most potent antibacterial activity against S.aureus and P.aeruginosa
bacterial strains. Compounds 11b and 11e displayed considerable IC50s of 7.9 and 
6.8 µg/mL, respectively, vs MDA-MB-231 cell lines of 7.5 and 8.3 µg/mL,
respectively, against the Caco-2 cell lines.
