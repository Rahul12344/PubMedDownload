Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens that are recognized by human CD8+ T cells are
potentially important vaccine target molecules. We used a motif-based strategy to
screen selected proteins of M. tuberculosis for peptides predicted to bind to
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201. We identified two 10 amino acid peptides
that elicited cytolytic T lymphocyte activity and interferon-gamma production by 
CD8+ T cells from HLA-A*0201+ healthy tuberculin reactors. These peptides were
derived from the 38-kDa antigen and the 28-kDa hemolysin, the latter being a
novel target for CD8+ T cells. We speculate that hemolysins may alter the
phagosomal membrane surrounding intracellular M. tuberculosis, allowing
themselves and other antigens to gain access to the major histocompatibility
complex class I processing pathway.
