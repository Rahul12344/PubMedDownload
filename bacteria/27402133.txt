Knowledge regarding host immune response to chromoblastomycosis and eumycetoma is
limited, particularly concerning cytokines and antimicrobial peptides production.
This was a retrospective study of 12 paraffin-embedded tissue samples from
patients diagnosed with chromoblastomycosis or eumycetoma from histological
findings and tissue culture. DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
from tissues were done to evaluate human interleukin-17A (IL-17A),
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1
beta (IL-1β) and human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) expressions. Human beta-actin
primer was used for confirming DNA detection, and DNA extracted from psoriasis
lesional skin samples was used as positive controls. The twelve paraffin-embedded
sections used in this study consisted of five chromoblastomycosis and seven
eumycetoma tissues. All PCR reactions showed beta-actin band at 51 bp in all
clinical specimens, confirming adequate DNA levels in each reaction. As positive 
control, the psoriasis skin samples revealed bands for IL-17A at 174 bp, IFN-γ at
273 bp, TNF-α at 360 bp, IL-1β at 276 bp and HBD-2 at 255 bp. For the
chromoblastomycosis and eumycetoma tissues, PCR analyses showed IL-17A band at
174 bp in two eumycetoma tissues and HBD-2 band at 255 bp in a
chromoblastomycosis tissue. This study demonstrated IL-17A expression in human
eumycetoma and HBD-2 expression in human chromoblastomycosis for the first time. 
However, their role in immune response remains to be elucidated.
