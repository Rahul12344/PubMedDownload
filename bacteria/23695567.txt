Serine-rich repeat glycoproteins (SRRPs) belong to a growing family of bacterial 
adhesins; they play important roles in bacterial virulence. Fap1, the first SRRP 
protein to be identified, is glycosylated; while the first two steps of its
glycosylation have been determined, the remaining glycosylation steps are
unknown. In a search for proteins that might be relevant to the glycosylation of 
Fap1, a putative glycosyltransferase (GalT1) from Streptococcus parasanguinis was
identified. GalT1 possesses a domain of unknown function at the N-terminus. This 
domain is highly conserved in bacteria and is a member of a broad superfamily.
However, the structure of this domain has not been determined. Here, the
conditions used to produce a recombinant version of this protein domain and to
grow protein crystals are reported. The crystals obtained belonged to space group
C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 71.0, b = 45.1, c = 78.6 Å, β = 109.6°, and
diffracted to 1.55 Å resolution at a synchrotron X-ray source. This domain does
not share sequence identity with proteins of known structures above a level of
12%.
