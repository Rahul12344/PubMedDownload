There exist two distinct thrombospondin molecules (designated TSP1 and TSP2)
which are encoded by separate genes. TSP1 is a trimeric cell surface and
extracellular matrix molecule. Sequence comparison reveals that the 2 cysteines
involved in interchain disulfide linkage and trimer assembly in TSP1 are
conserved in TSP2 (Laherty, C. D., O'Rourke, K., Wolf, F. W., Katz, R., Seldin,
M. F., and Dixit, V. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 3274-3281). Swiss 3T3
fibroblasts express both TSP1 and TSP2, and, therefore, an important question is 
whether TSP in such cells is expressed as homotrimers or as heterotrimers. We
find that Swiss 3T3 cells and epithelial cells transfected with TSP expression
vectors express both homo- and heterotrimeric forms of TSP. In addition,
homotrimeric TSP2 has a lower affinity for heparin than homotrimeric TSP1. Thus, 
the heparin affinity of TSP can be modulated by the expression of TSP as homo- or
heterotrimers.
