Ixodes ricinus ticks and mice can be infected with both Borrelia burgdorferi
sensu stricto and Borrelia garinii. The effect of coinfection with these two
Borrelia species on the development of murine Lyme borreliosis is unknown.
Therefore, we investigated whether coinfection with the nonarthritogenic B.
garinii strain PBi and the arthritogenic B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 
alters murine Lyme borreliosis. Mice simultaneously infected with PBi and B31
showed significantly more paw swelling and arthritis, long-standing
spirochetemia, and higher numbers of B31 spirochetes than did mice infected with 
B31 alone. However, the number of PBi spirochetes was significantly lower in
coinfected mice than in mice infected with PBi alone. In conclusion, simultaneous
infection with B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto results in more severe
Lyme borreliosis. Moreover, we suggest that competition of the two Borrelia
species within the reservoir host could have led to preferential maintenance, and
a rising prevalence, of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in European I. ricinus
populations.
