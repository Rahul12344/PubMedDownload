Cells of the immune system possess many multisubunit receptors that are composed 
of a ligand-binding subunit associated with distinct signaling adaptors
containing one or more immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs).
These receptors include the T cell receptor, the B cell receptor, and many Fc
receptors, as well as families of activating receptors on myeloid and natural
killer cells. Receptors that associate with ITAM-containing adaptors classically 
have been viewed as transducing activating signals involving phosphorylation of
the tyrosines within the ITAM and recruitment of Syk family tyrosine kinases.
Receptors associated with ITAM-containing adaptors in myeloid cells have also
been implicated in inhibition of cellular activation. Here, we discuss these new 
negative roles for signaling by receptors that associate with ITAM-bearing
adaptors in myeloid and other cell types within the immune system.
