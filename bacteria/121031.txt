The chemotactic, phagocytic, and microbial killing abilities of primate
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML).

Eichberg JW, Kalter SS, Kniker WT, Steel RW, Heberling RL.

Functions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and
microbial killing were investigated in baboons (Papio cynocephalus), cebus
monkeys (Cebus apella), and marmosets (Saguinus oedipus). Cells from a group of
normal adult human volunteers were also studied for comparison. Polymorphonuclear
leukocytes from the three nonhuman primate species were comparable to each other 
and to humans in chemotactic activity using endotoxin activated serum. In
addition, the ability of blood leukocytes to ingest and kill microorganisms was
investigated using a new fluorochrome microassay. Leukocytes of all non-human
primates were competent in phagocytosing bacteria, but leukocytes from cebus
monkeys and marmosets ingested candida organisms poorly. Compared to humans, all 
nonhuman primates exhibited poor killing of the microbes.
