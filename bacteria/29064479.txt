Temperate coastal marine environments are replete with complex biotic and abiotic
interactions that are amplified during spring and summer phytoplankton blooms.
During these events, heterotrophic bacterioplankton respond to successional
releases of dissolved organic matter as algal cells are lysed. Annual seasonal
shifts in the community composition of free-living bacterioplankton follow
broadly predictable patterns, but whether similar communities respond each year
to bloom disturbance events remains unknown owing to a lack of data sets,
employing high-frequency sampling over multiple years. We capture the fine-scale 
microdiversity of these events with weekly sampling using a high-resolution
method to discriminate 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons that are >99% identical. 
Furthermore, we used 2 complete years of data to facilitate identification of
recurrent sub-networks of co-varying microbes. We demonstrate that despite
inter-annual variation in phytoplankton blooms and despite the dynamism of a
coastal-oceanic transition zone, patterns of microdiversity are recurrent during 
both bloom and non-bloom conditions. Sub-networks of co-occurring microbes
identified reveal that correlation structures between community members appear
quite stable in a seasonally driven response to oligotrophic and eutrophic
conditions.
