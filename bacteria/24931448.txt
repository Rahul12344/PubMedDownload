Biodegradation of marine surface floating crude oil with hydrocarbon degrading
bacteria, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and nutrients was carried out by a
large-scale field simulated experiment in this paper. After a 103 day experiment,
for n-alkanes, the maximum biodegradation rate reached 71% and the results showed
hydrocarbon degrading bacteria, rhamnolipid biosurfactants, and nutrients have a 
comprehensive effect. It also showed that rhamnolipid biosurfactants could
shorten the biodegradation time through an emulsifying function; the nutrients
could greatly increase the biodegradation rate by promoting HDB production. For
PAHs, the chrysene series had higher weathering resistance. For the same series, 
the weathering resistance ability is C1- < C2- < C3- < C4-. After 53 days, no
comprehensive effect occurred and more biodegradation was found for different
n-alkanes in two pools which only had added rhamnolipid biosurfactants or
nutrients, respectively. Except for C14, C15 and C16 sesquiterpanes, most of the 
steranes and terpanes had high antibiodegradability.
