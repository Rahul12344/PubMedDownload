Pulmonary macrophages provide the preferred hiding and replication site of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis but display antimicrobial functions. This raises
questions regarding the role of macrophages during tuberculosis. We depleted
lungs of activated macrophages (activated macrophage(-) mice) and compared this
with nonselective macrophage depletion (macrophage(-) mice). Although
nonselective depletion of macrophages after infection improved clinical outcome, 
depletion of activated macrophages led to impaired resistance, reflected by
enhanced mycobacterial outgrowth. The production of tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
and numbers of granuloma decreased after depletion of activated macrophages. Both
macrophage(-) and activated macrophage(-) mice showed polarized production of
interferon- gamma by splenocytes and lymph-node cells and were able to attract
and activate T cells in the lung. These data demonstrate that the dual role of
macrophages is associated with the activation state of macrophages and that
extensive apoptosis found in patients with tuberculosis could be part of a host
defense strategy, as long as these cells are not activated.
