INTRODUCTION: Septicaemia on endocardial pacemaker leads is very rare but the
presentation is insidious and the prognosis very bad if all the implanted
materiel is not completely removed.
OBSERVATION: A 55 year-old woman presented three episodes of Staphylococcus
epidermidis septicaemia in three years, after incomplete removal of the pacing
system. Permanent cure was finally obtained after complete removal of the
pacemaker material.
COMMENT: Emphasis must be placed on the difficulty in diagnosing and treating
such affections, their severity and also the interest of a certain number of
prophylactic measures.
