NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is an aggressive subtype of squamous cell carcinoma
that typically harbors BRD4/3-NUT fusion oncoproteins that block differentiation 
and maintain tumor growth. In 20% of cases, NUT is fused to uncharacterized
non-BRD gene(s). We established a new patient-derived NMC cell line (1221) and
demonstrated that it harbors a novel NSD3-NUT fusion oncogene. We find that
NSD3-NUT is both necessary and sufficient for the blockade of differentiation and
maintenance of proliferation in NMC cells. NSD3-NUT binds to BRD4, and BRD
bromodomain inhibitors induce differentiation and arrest proliferation of 1221
cells. We find further that NSD3 is required for the blockade of differentiation 
in BRD4-NUT-expressing NMCs. These findings identify NSD3 as a novel critical
oncogenic component and potential therapeutic target in NMC.SIGNIFICANCE: The
existence of a family of fusion oncogenes in squamous cell carcinoma is
unprecedented, and should lead to key insights into aberrant differentiation in
NMC and possibly other squamous cell carcinomas. The involvement of the NSD3
methyltransferase as a component of the NUT fusion protein oncogenic complex
identifies a new potential therapeutic target.
