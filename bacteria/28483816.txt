Bacterial pathogens often subvert the innate immune system to establish a
successful infection. The direct inhibition of downstream components of innate
immune pathways is particularly well documented but how bacteria interfere with
receptor proximal events is far less well understood. Here, we describe a
Toll/interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing protein (PumA) of the
multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA7 strain. We found that PumA is
essential for virulence and inhibits NF-κB, a property transferable to non-PumA
strain PA14, suggesting no additional factors are needed for PumA function. The
TIR domain is able to interact with the Toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptors TIRAP
and MyD88, as well as the ubiquitin-associated protein 1 (UBAP1), a component of 
the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-I). These
interactions are not spatially exclusive as we show UBAP1 can associate with
MyD88, enhancing its plasma membrane localization. Combined targeting of UBAP1
and TLR adaptors by PumA impedes both cytokine and TLR receptor signalling,
highlighting a novel strategy for innate immune evasion.
