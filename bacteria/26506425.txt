We identified the UBE2L6 gene, encoding the ISG15-conjugating enzyme UbcH8, as
one gene significantly downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Reduced expression of the UbcH8 protein
correlated with poor outcome in NPC patients. Restored expression of UBE2L6
suppressed proliferation and colony formation in NPC cells, while inducing
apoptosis. Of particular interest, we found that aberrant lipid turnover was
controlled by UbcH8 in NPC through ISG15-conjugation of valosin-containing
protein (VCP). Tumor tissue and NPC cell lines showed conspicuously strong
accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs) compared to control nasopharyngeal
epithelium and non-cancerous cell lines. We demonstrated that UbcH8 counteracts
degradation of adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL), a key enzyme in lipid
catabolism.
