RsmA, a ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase from Staphylococcus aureus,
catalyzes the N(6) methylation of adenine in 16S rRNA. In this study, RsmA from
Staphylococcus aureus was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. The
crystal belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 84.38, b =
157.76, c = 96.50 Å, β = 95.04°. X-ray diffraction data were collected to a
resolution of 3.2 Å. The self-rotation function and the Matthews coefficient
suggested the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit.
