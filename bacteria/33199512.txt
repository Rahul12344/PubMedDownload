Immunotherapy is now a cornerstone for cancer treatment, and much attention has
been placed on the identification of prognostic and predictive biomarkers. The
success of biomarker development is dependent on accurate and timely collection
of biospecimens and high-quality processing, storage and shipping. Tumors are
also increasingly used as source material for the generation of therapeutic T
cells. There have been few guidelines or consensus statements on how to optimally
collect and manage biospecimens and source material being used for immunotherapy 
and related research. The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Surgery Committee
has brought together surgical experts from multiple subspecialty disciplines to
identify best practices and to provide consensus on how best to access and manage
specific tissues for immuno-oncology treatments and clinical investigation. In
addition, the committee recommends early integration of surgeons and other
interventional physicians with expertise in biospecimen collection, especially in
clinical trials, to optimize the quality of tissue and the validity of
correlative clinical studies in cancer immunotherapy.
