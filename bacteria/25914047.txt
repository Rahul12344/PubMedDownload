OBJECTIVE: In the present study, we have investigated the prognostic value of
known stem cell-associated molecules such as Oct4, CD44 and c-Myc in patients
with oral SCC who had received post-surgery radio- and/or chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyse the
expression of Oct4, CD44 and c-Myc in 87 tumour tissues, and the expression
profile obtained was correlated with clinicopathological parameters of the
patients with oral cancer. Tumourigenic potential of these molecules was also
evaluated by in vivo studies.
RESULTS: Our results showed significant correlation of Oct4 (OS, p = 0.003; DFS, 
p = 0.001) and c-Myc (OS, p = 0.01; DFS, p = 0.03) with overall survival and
disease-free survival independently. Furthermore, all the three markers in
combinations of two markers each, i.e. Oct4 + CD44 (OS, p = 0.003; DFS,
p = 0.001), Oct4 + c-Myc (OS, p = 0.0001; DFS, p = 0.0001), CD44 + c-Myc (OS,
p = 0.008; DFS, p = 0.02) and in combinations of three markers each, i.e.
Oct4 + CD44 + c-Myc (OS, p = 0.0001; DFS, p = 0.0001) also significantly
correlated with overall survival and disease-free survival. Univariate and
multivariate analyses further established the independent prognostic value of
Oct4. Oct4-, CD44- and c-Myc-enriched populations independently induced
sarcomatoid carcinomas whereas primary keratinocytes developed poorly
differentiated carcinomas in immunodeficient mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Oct4 and c-Myc independently as well as in combination with CD44
might be useful for the prediction of local recurrence and poor survival of
patients with oral cancer which is the novel finding of this study.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Oct4, c-Myc and CD44 can be used to predict local recurrence 
and the outcome of treatment in oral cancer patients. In addition, these
molecules may find use as molecular targets for effective therapy.
