Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein (AMP)-activated kinase (AMPK) is a
highly conserved kinase that plays a key role in energy homeostasis. Activation
of AMPK was shown to reduce inflammation in response to lipolysaccharide in vitro
and in vivo. 5-Aminoimidazole-4-carbox-amide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) is
intracellularly converted to the AMP analog ZMP, which activates AMPK.
Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a major component of the cell wall of Gram-positive
bacteria that can trigger inflammatory responses. In contrast to
lipopolysaccharide, little is known on the effects of AMPK activation in
LTA-triggered innate immune responses. Here, we studied the potency of AMPK
activation to reduce LTA-induced inflammation in vitro and in lungs in vivo.
Activation of AMPK in vitro reduced cytokine production in the alveolar
macrophage cell line MH-S. In vivo, AMPK activation reduced LTA-induced
neutrophil influx, as well as protein leak and cytokine/chemokine levels in the
bronchoalveolar space. In conclusion, AMPK activation inhibits LTA-induced lung
inflammation in mice.
