A putative lipolytic enzyme gene, named as est9x, was obtained from a marine
microbial metagenome of the South China Sea. Sequence analysis showed that Est9X 
shares lower than 27% sequence identities with the characterized lipolytic
enzymes, but possesses a catalytic triad highly conserved in lipolytic enzymes of
the α/β hydrolase superfamily. By phylogenetic tree construction, Est9X was
grouped into a new lipase/esterase family. To understand Est9X protein in depth, 
it was recombinantly expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized. Within
potential hydrolytic activities, only lipase/esterase activity was detected for
Est9X, confirming its identity as a lipolytic enzyme. When using p-nitrophenol
esters with varying lengths of fatty acid as substrates, Est9X exhibited the
highest activity to the C2 substrate, indicating it is an esterase. The optimal
activity of Est9X occurred at a temperature of 65°C, and Est9X was pretty stable 
below the optimum temperature. Distinguished from other salttolerant esterases,
Est9X's activity was tolerant to and even promoted by as high as 4 M NaCl. Our
results imply that Est9X is a unique esterase and could be a potential candidate 
for industrial application under extreme conditions.
