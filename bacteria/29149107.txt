BACKGROUND: Periodontal pathogens have been linked to oral and gastrointestinal
(orodigestive) carcinogenesis. However, the exact mechanisms remain unknown.
Treponema denticola (Td) is associated with severe periodontitis, a chronic
inflammatory disease leading to tooth loss. The anaerobic spirochete Td is an
invasive bacteria due to its major virulence factor chymotrypsin-like proteinase.
Here we aimed to investigate the presence of Td chymotrypsin-like proteinase
(Td-CTLP) in major orodigestive tumours and to elucidate potential mechanisms for
Td to contribute to carcinogenesis.
METHODS: The presence of Td-CTLP within orodigestive tumour tissues was examined 
using immunohistochemistry. Oral, tonsillar, and oesophageal squamous cell
carcinomas, alongside gastric, pancreatic, and colon adenocarcinomas were stained
with a Td-CTLP-specific antibody. Gingival tissue from periodontitis patients
served as positive controls. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot were used to analyse the
immumodulatory activity of Td-CTLP in vitro.
RESULTS: Td-CTLP was present in majority of orodigestive tumour samples. Td-CTLP 
was found to convert pro MMP-8 and -9 into their active forms. In addition,
Td-CTLP was able to degrade the proteinase inhibitors TIMP-1, TIMP-2, and
α-1-antichymotrypsin, as well as complement C1q.
CONCLUSIONS: Because of its presence within tumours and regulatory activity on
proteins critical for the regulation of tumour microenvironment and inflammation,
the Td-CTLP may contribute to orodigestive carcinogenesis.
