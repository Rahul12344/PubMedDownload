BACKGROUND: Costimulatory blockade with anti-CD40L monoclonal antibody (mAb) plus
donor-specific splenocyte transfusion (DST) induces alloantigen-specific
tolerance. We previously showed that lymphotoxin signaling in the fibroblastic
reticular cell (FRC) stromal subset was required for proper lymph node structure 
and function during tolerization in murine cardiac transplantation. Here we
focused on FRC functions and hypothesized that DST and anti-CD40L mAb-modulated
FRC interactions with CD4(+) T cells in mice.
METHODS: Mice were immunized or tolerized by DST or DST plus anti-CD40L mAb.
Fibroblastic reticular cells were flow-sorted at different timepoints for
characterization and in vitro proliferation and activation assays.
RESULTS: Fibroblastic reticular cells responded rapidly to DST by transcribing
inflammatory cytokine and chemokine messenger RNAs, such as CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10,
and CCL21. Conversely, anti-CD40L mAb inhibited FRC inflammatory responses. CD40 
was expressed on FRC and agonistic anti-CD40 mAb activated FRC, which supported
CD4(+) T-cell proliferation, whereas unstimulated FRC did not. Anti-CD3
mAb-activated CD4(+) T cells induced inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
expressions by FRC, which were inhibited by anti-CD40L mAb. Thus, FRC phenotype
was altered by interaction with CD4(+) T cells through CD40-CD40L, and activated 
FRC interacted directly with CD4(+) T cells to support T cell activation and
proliferation in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results demonstrated that CD40 on FRC
facilitated bidirectional communication between FRC and CD4(+) T cells via
CD40-CD40L, thereby altering FRC gene expression of immune regulatory molecules. 
Because blockade of CD40-CD40L interactions results in tolerance in mice,
identification of FRC-T cell interactions provides a new research target for
tolerance induction.
