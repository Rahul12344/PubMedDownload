Chemotaxis and motility greatly influence the infectivity of Vibrio cholerae,
although the role of chemotaxis genes in V. cholerae pathogenesis is poorly
understood. In contrast to the single copy of CheY found in Escherichia coli and 
Salmonella typhimurium, four CheYs (CheY1-CheY4) are present in V. cholerae.
While insertional disruption of the cheY4 gene results in decreased motility,
insertional duplication of this gene increases motility and causes enhanced
expression of the two major virulence genes. Additionally, cheY3/cheY4 influences
the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which triggers the generation
of acute inflammatory responses. V. cholerae CheY4 was cloned, overexpressed and 
purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Crystals
of CheY4 grown in space group C2 diffracted to 1.67 Å resolution, with unit-cell 
parameters a = 94.4, b = 31.9, c = 32.6 Å, β = 96.5°, whereas crystals grown in
space group P3(2)21 diffracted to 1.9 Å resolution, with unit-cell parameters a =
b = 56.104, c = 72.283 Å, γ = 120°.
