The diversity of cardiac lineages contributes to the heterogeneity of human
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs). Here, we
report the generation of a hiPSC TBX5Clover2 and NKX2-5TagRFP double reporter to 
delineate cardiac lineages and isolate lineage-specific subpopulations. Molecular
analyses reveal that four different subpopulations can be isolated based on the
differential expression of TBX5 and NKX2-5, TBX5+NKX2-5+, TBX5+NKX2-5-,
TBX5-NKX2-5+, and TBX5-NKX2-5-, mimicking the first heart field, epicardial,
second heart field, and endothelial lineages, respectively. Genetic and
functional characterization indicates that each subpopulation differentiates into
specific cardiac cells. We further identify CORIN as a cell-surface marker for
isolating the TBX5+NKX2-5+ subpopulation and demonstrate the use of
lineage-specific CMs for precise drug testing. We anticipate that this tool will 
facilitate the investigation of cardiac lineage specification and isolation of
specific cardiac subpopulations for drug screening, tissue engineering, and
disease modeling.
