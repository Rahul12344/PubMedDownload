During thymic development, mouse γδ T cells commit to either an IFN-γ- or an
IL-17-producing phenotype through mechanisms that remain unclear. In this study, 
we investigated the extent to which the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway regulates the 
functional programming of γδ T cells. Characterization of SLAM family receptor
expression revealed that thymic γδ T cell subsets were each marked by distinct
coexpression profiles of SLAMF1, SLAMF4, and SLAMF6. In the thymus, Vγ1 and Vγ4 T
cells that exhibited an SLAMF1+SLAMF6+ double positive phenotype were largely
contained within immature CD24+CD73- and CD24+CD73+ subsets, whereas SLAMF1
single positive, SLAMF6 single positive, or SLAMF1SLAMF6 double negative cells
were found within mature CD24-CD73+ and CD24-CD73- subsets. In the periphery,
SLAMF1 and SLAMF6 expression distinguished IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing γδ T cells,
respectively. Disruption of SLAM family receptor signaling through deletion of
SAP resulted in impaired thymic Vγ1 and Vγ4 T cell maturation at the
CD24+CD73-SLAMF1+SLAMF6+ double positive stage that was associated with a
decreased frequency of CD44+RORγt+ γδ T cells. Impaired development was in turn
associated with decreased γδ T cell IL-17 and IFN-γ production in the thymus as
well as in peripheral tissues. The role for SAP was subset-specific, as Vγ1Vδ6.3,
Vγ4, Vγ5, but not Vγ6 subsets were SAP-dependent. Together, these data suggest
that the SLAM/SAP signaling pathway plays a larger role in γδ T cell development 
than previously appreciated and represents a critical checkpoint in the
functional programming of both IL-17- and IFN-γ-producing γδ T cell subsets.
