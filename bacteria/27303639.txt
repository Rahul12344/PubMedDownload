In the 1990s several biocontrol agents on that contained Burkholderia strains
were registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). After
risk assessment these products were withdrawn from the market and a moratorium
was placed on the registration of Burkholderia-containing products, as these
strains may pose a risk to human health. However, over the past few years the
number of novel Burkholderia species that exhibit plant-beneficial properties and
are normally not isolated from infected patients has increased tremendously. In
this commentary we wish to summarize recent efforts that aim at discerning
pathogenic from beneficial Burkholderia strains.
