Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated, autoimmune neuromuscular disease.
Animal models of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) can be induced 
in vertebrates by immunization with Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptors
(AChR) in complete Freund's adjuvant. The MHC class II genes influence the
cellular and humoral immune response to AChR and are involved in the development 
of clinical EAMG in mice. A dominant epitope within the AChR alpha146-162 region 
activates MHC class II-restricted CD4 cells and is involved in the production of 
pathogenic anti-AChR antibodies by B cells. Neonatal or adult tolerance to this
T-cell epitope could prevent EAMG. During an immune response to AChR in vivo,
multiple TCR genes are used. The CD28-B7 and CD40L-CD40 interaction is required
during the primary immune response to AChR. However, CTLA-4 blockade augmented T-
and B-cell immune response to AChR and disease. Cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-12
upregulate, while IFN-alpha downregulates, EAMG pathogenesis. However, the Th2
cytokine IL-4 fails to play a significant role in the development of
antibody-mediated EAMG. Systemic or mucosal tolerance to AChR or its dominant
peptide(s) has prevented EAMG in an antigen-specific manner. Antigen-specific
tolerance and downregulation of pathogenic cytokines could achieve effective
therapy of EAMG and probably MG.
