Comparative genomics of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) reveals a
similar distribution of the 10 most prevalent ESBL-Ec clones and ESBL genes among
human community faecal and extra-intestinal infection isolates in the Netherlands
(2014-17).

INTRODUCTION: The human gut microbiota is an important reservoir of
ESBL-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec). Community surveillance studies of
ESBL-Ec to monitor circulating clones and ESBL genes are logistically challenging
and costly.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if isolates obtained in routine clinical practice can be 
used as an alternative to monitor the distribution of clones and ESBL genes
circulating in the community.
METHODS: WGS was performed on 451 Dutch ESBL-Ec isolates (2014-17), including 162
community faeces and 289 urine and blood isolates. We compared proportions of 10 
most frequently identified STs, PopPUNK-based sequence clusters (SCs) and ESBL
gene subtypes and the degree of similarity using Czekanowski's proportional
similarity index (PSI).
RESULTS: Nine out of 10 most prevalent STs and SCs and 8/10 most prevalent ESBL
genes in clinical ESBL-Ec were also the most common types in community faeces.
The proportions of ST131 (39% versus 23%) and SC131 (40% versus 25%) were higher 
in clinical isolates than in community faeces (P < 0.01). Within ST131, H30Rx
(C2) subclade was more prevalent among clinical isolates (55% versus 26%,
P < 0.01). The proportion of ESBL gene blaCTX-M-1 was lower in clinical isolates 
(5% versus 18%, P < 0.01). Czekanowski's PSI confirmed that the differences in
ESBL-Ec from community faeces and clinical isolates were limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Distributions of the 10 most prevalent clones and ESBL genes from
ESBL-Ec community gut colonization and extra-intestinal infection overlapped in
majority, indicating that isolates from routine clinical practice could be used
to monitor ESBL-Ec clones and ESBL genes in the community.
