We have isolated a murine cDNA by virtue of its expression in pre-B cell lines
but not in plasmacytomas. In mouse, mRNA is detected by Northern blot analysis
exclusively in hematopoietic tissues with the exception of brain. When expressed 
in bacteria, the encoded protein is specifically recognized by several antibodies
against the murine hematopoietic differentiation marker called heat-stable
antigen (HSA). In contrast to previous speculations, these results suggest that
the antigenic determinant recognized by anti-HSA antibodies is proteinaceous. The
cDNA sequence is essentially identical to a mouse HSA cDNA recently published
(Kay et al., J. Immunol. 1990. 145: 1952). Three HSA genes were isolated, one of 
which corresponds to the isolated cDNA. The other two appear to be intronless
retroposons which, despite numerous sequence changes, maintain an open reading
frame. One of these intronless genes could code for an alternative form of HSA
with a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail not encoded by the
intron-containing gene. This gene could be expressed, based on sequence
comparisons of the three genes. However, using polymerase chain reaction
amplification of first strand cDNA from various cell lines and adult mouse
tissues, we could detect expression only of the intron-containing gene.
