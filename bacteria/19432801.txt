Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium, is the causative agent for the
disease called listeriosis. This pathogen utilizes host cell surface proteins
such as E-cadherin or c-Met in order to invade eukaryotic cells. The invasion via
c-Met depends on the bacterial protein InlB that activates c-Met phosphorylation 
and internalization mimicking in many regards HGF, the authentic c-Met ligand. In
this paper, we demonstrate that the activation of c-Met induced by InlB is
dependent on CD44v6, a member of the CD44 family of transmembrane glycoproteins. 
Inhibiting CD44v6 by means of a blocking peptide, a CD44v6 antibody or
CD44v6-specific siRNA prevents the activation of c-Met induced by InlB.
Subsequently, signalling, scattering and the entry of InlB-coated beads into host
cells are also impaired by CD44v6 blocking reagents. For the entry process,
ezrin, a protein that links the CD44v6 cytoplasmic domain to the cytoskeleton, is
required as well. Most importantly, this collaboration between c-Met and CD44v6
contributes to the invasion of L. monocytogenes into target cells as demonstrated
by a drastic decrease in bacterial invasion in the presence of blocking agents
such as the CD44v6 peptide or antibody.
