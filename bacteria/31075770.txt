The Fusarium species are one of the most common opportunistic fungal infections
occurring in immunocompromised patients and are associated with high morbidity
and mortality. Common sites of infection include blood, skin, nasal passages,
lungs, bone, and other visceral organs. There is a paucity of literature on
Fusarium infections in the brain, and the true nature and extent of central
nervous system involvement is not well described. To the authors' knowledge,
there have been no reported cases of Fusarium infection of the spine. The authors
report the case of a man with acute myeloblastic leukemia and resultant
pancytopenia who presented with fungal sinusitis, upper- and lower-extremity
weakness, and cardiopulmonary arrest. Imaging studies revealed a spinal cervical 
intramedullary ring-enhancing lesion. Because of the progressive nature of his
symptoms, neurosurgical intervention involving a C2-3 laminectomy and drainage of
the lesion was performed. Intraoperative cultures and histopathology results were
positive for Fusarium species and, along with intraoperative findings, were
consistent with a fungus ball. The patient was placed on a regimen of intravenous
and intrathecal antifungal therapy. Unfortunately, his clinical condition
declined postoperatively, and he ultimately died of disseminated infection.
