Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (TIL) yields
promising clinical results in metastatic melanoma patients, who failed standard
treatments. Due to the fact that metastatic lung cancer has proven to be
susceptible to immunotherapy and possesses a high mutation burden, which makes it
responsive to T cell attack, we explored the feasibility of TIL ACT in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Multiple TIL cultures were isolated from tumor
specimens of five NSCLC patients undergoing thoracic surgery. We were able to
successfully establish TIL cultures by various methods from all patients within
an average of 14Â days. Fifteen lung TIL cultures were further expanded to
treatment levels under good manufacturing practice conditions and functionally
and phenotypically characterized. Lung TIL expanded equally well as 103 melanoma 
TIL obtained from melanoma patients previously treated at our center, and had a
similar phenotype regarding PD1, CD28, and 4-1BB expressions, but contained a
higher percent of CD4 T cells. Lung carcinoma cell lines were established from
three patients of which two possessed TIL cultures with specific in vitro
anti-tumor reactivity. Here, we report the successful pre-clinical production of 
TIL for immunotherapy in the lung cancer setting, which may provide a new
treatment modality for patients with metastatic NSCLC. The initiation of a
clinical trial is planned for the near future.
