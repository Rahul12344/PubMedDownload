Las1 is a recently discovered endoribonuclease that collaborates with
Grc3-Rat1-Rai1 to process precursor ribosomal RNA (rRNA), yet its mechanism of
action remains unknown. Disruption of the mammalian Las1 gene has been linked to 
congenital lethal motor neuron disease and X-linked intellectual disability
disorders, thus highlighting the necessity to understand Las1 regulation and
function. Here, we report that the essential Las1 endoribonuclease requires its
binding partner, the polynucleotide kinase Grc3, for specific C2 cleavage. Our
results establish that Grc3 drives Las1 endoribonuclease cleavage to its targeted
C2 site both in vitro and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, we observed
Las1-dependent activation of the Grc3 kinase activity exclusively toward
single-stranded RNA. Together, Las1 and Grc3 assemble into a tetrameric complex
that is required for competent rRNA processing. The tetrameric Grc3/Las1 cross
talk draws unexpected parallels to endoribonucleases RNaseL and Ire1, and
establishes Grc3/Las1 as a unique member of the RNaseL/Ire1 RNA splicing family. 
Together, our work provides mechanistic insight for the regulation of the Las1
endoribonuclease and identifies the tetrameric Grc3/Las1 complex as a unique
example of a protein-guided programmable endoribonuclease.
