This study aimed to evaluate whether ICU patients who developed persistent
critical illness displayed an immune profile similar to an aged immune phenotype 
and any associations with patient outcomes. Twenty two critically ill ICU
patients (27-76 years, 15 males), at day 5 of mechanical ventilation, and 22
healthy age-matched controls (27-77 years, 13 males) were recruited. Frequency
and phenotype of innate and adaptive immune cells and telomere length in
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were measured. An elevated granulocyte
count (p < 0.0001), increased numbers of immature granulocytes (p < 0.0001),
increased CD16++ve monocytes (p = 0.003) and CD14+ve HLADRdim/low monocytes
(p = 0.004) and lower NK cell numbers (p = 0.007) were observed in ICU patients
compared to controls. Critically ill patients also had lower numbers of total T
lymphocytes (p = 0.03), naïve CD4 T cells (p = 0.003) and PTK7+ve recent thymic
emigrants (p = 0.002), and increased senescent CD28-ve CD57+ve CD4 T cells
(p = 0.02), but there was no difference in PBMC telomere length. Regulatory
immune cell frequency was affected with reduced circulating CD19+veCD24hiCD38hi
regulatory B cells (p = 0.02). However, only a raised neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio
and reduced frequency of CD14+ve HLADRdim/low monocytes were associated with poor
outcomes. We conclude that persistent critical illness results in changes to
immune cell phenotype only some of which are similar to that seen in
physiological ageing of the immune system.
