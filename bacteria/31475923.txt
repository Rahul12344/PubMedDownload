Moenomycin-type antibiotics are phosphoglycolipids that are notable for their
unique modes of action and have proven to be useful in animal nutrition. The gene
clusters tchm from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus and moe from Streptomyces are
among a limited number of known moenomycin-biosynthetic pathways. Most genes in
tchm have counterparts in the moe cluster, except for tchmy and tchmz, the
functions of which remain unknown. Sequence analysis indicates that TchmY belongs
to the isoprenoid enzyme C2-like superfamily and may serve as a prenylcyclase.
The enzyme was proposed to be involved in terminal cyclization of the moenocinyl 
chain in teichomycin, leading to the diumycinol chain of moenomycin isomers.
Here, recombinant TchmY protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and its crystal
structure was solved by SIRAS. Structural analysis and comparison with other
prenylcyclases were performed. The overall fold of TchmY consists of an
(α/α)6-barrel, and a potential substrate-binding pocket is found in the central
chamber. These results should provide important information regarding the
biosynthetic basis of moenomycin antibiotics.
