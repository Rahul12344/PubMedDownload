In contrast to the majority of O2-activating enzymes, which depend on an organic 
cofactor or a metal ion for catalysis, a particular group of structurally
unrelated oxygenases is functional without any cofactor. In this study, we
characterized the mechanism of O2 activation in the reaction pathway of a
cofactor-independent dioxygenase with an α/β-hydrolase fold, which catalyzes the 
oxygenolytic cleavage of 2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolones. Chemical analysis
and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic data revealed that O2
activation in the enzyme's active site is substrate-assisted, relying on single
electron transfer from the bound substrate anion to O2 to form a radical pair,
which recombines to a C2-peroxide intermediate. Thus, an oxygenase can function
without a cofactor, if the organic substrate itself, after activation to a
(carb)anion by an active-site base, is intrinsically reactive toward molecular
oxygen.
