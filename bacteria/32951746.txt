OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to compare the effect of an Oak Gall
extract‑based cream and a metronidazole Gel on the bacterial vaginosis among
women in reproductive age.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial
performed on 84 women with BV in reproductive age. Accordingly, the women were
randomly assigned to the Oak Gall (n = 42) or metronidazole (n = 42) groups.
Diagnosis of BV was confirmed when at least 3 of the 4 Amsel criteria were met by
the participants (whitish-grey or thin homogeneous discharge, pH ≥ 4.5, the
release of a fishy odor on the addition of 10 % KOH, and detection of clue cells 
> 20 % in the microscopic examination). For each group, either a methanol extract
of Oak Gall vaginal cream or a metronidazole vaginal gel (5 g) was used as
intravaginal for 5 consecutive days, and all the signs or symptoms were assessed 
by passing 4-7 days from the treatment completion.
RESULTS: At baseline, the two groups were homogenous in terms of the vaginal
burning, odor, dysuria, dyspareunia, and itching. Also, all women in both groups 
were free of symptoms (vaginal itching and burning sensation, bad odor, dysuria, 
and dyspareunia) by passing one week from the intervention (p < 0.001). The
percent of bacterial vaginosis treatment was in 33(82.1 %) patients in terms of
Oak Gall group and in 34(87.5 %) patients of Metronidazole group (p=0.56).
Notably, Oak Gall was as effective and safe as metronidazole in the treatment of 
BV in reproductive-aged women.
CONCLUSION: Oak Gall could be recommended for women in reproductive age who are
uncomfortable with the potential side effects of synthetic drugs.
