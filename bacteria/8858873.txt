We report the phenotypic selection of two lines of Aedes aegypti, from a filariae
susceptible parental stock (Refm). This selection was based upon the level of
inducible anti-gram negative Escherichia coli activity within the haemolymph
following E. coli infection. These lines, denoted 'high' and 'low', demonstrated 
significant differences in anti-E. coli responses throughout. However no
difference was observed in the anti-gram positive Micrococcus luteus response
following E. coli challenge. F4, F6 and F9 mosquitoes were experimentally
infected with Brugia pahangi microfilariae. Reductions of between 53 and 82% in
the mean number of larvae completing development in the 'high' compared with the 
'low' responding line were observed. Corresponding reductions of between 30 and
50% in the mosquito infection rates also occurred between these lines. These
reductions were significant for trials on the F6 and F9 generations. We have
therefore selected for Ae. aegypti possessing significant refractoriness to
filaria infection. Importantly, this 'high' line has not been exposed to
selection pressure using filariae development as a phenotypic selective marker.
