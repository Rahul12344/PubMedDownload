Micavibrio gen. nov. (M.L. fem. n. mica--a tiny thing and M.L. masc. n. Vibroia
generic name, M.L. masc. n. Micavibrio a tiny vibrio). Cells are single, small
curved rods, in motile stage with a single polar not sheathed flagellum.
Reproduced by binary division, gram-negative. Cells attach to host-bacteria cells
and grow as exoparasites destroying the host, may exhibit a host-range
specificity. The G + C content of the DNA of the strain examined is 57,1% M.
Isolated from sewage waters. The type species is M. admirandus sp. nov. M.
admirandus sp. nov (M.L. adj. admirable). Curved gram-negative rods
0,25-0,35X0,6-1,0 micron with a single flagellum 13-15 nm in width. Motile cells 
attach to the cell wall of the bacterium. Pseudomonas maltophilia, lose the
motility and grow as exoparasites destroying the host. Develops only on. P.
maltophilia cells and is unable to multiply in the absence of a host organism.
Resistant to a vibriostatic agent pteridine 0/129. The G + C content of the DNA
of the strain examined is 57,1% M. The type strain ARL-14 is maintained in the
culture collection of the Institute of Biochemistry and Physiology of
Microorganisms, USSR Academy of Sciences. The type strain has been isolated from 
sewage waters of the town of Pushchino.
