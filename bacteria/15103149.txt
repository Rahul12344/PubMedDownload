RR02 (MicA) is an essential bacterial protein that belongs to the YycF family of 
response regulators and consists of two domains: an N-terminal receiver domain
and a C-terminal effector domain. Streptococcus pneumoniae RR02 (MicA; residues
2-234) has been crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion technique.
The crystals belong to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 46.46, b 
= 32.61, c = 63.35 A, beta = 90.01 degrees. X-ray diffraction data have been
collected to 1.93 A resolution.
