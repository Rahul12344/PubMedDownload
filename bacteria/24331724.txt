The incidence of invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is constantly increasing, due to 
the growing number of immunocompromised patients. We report the case of a
73-year-old patient with a severe aortic stenosis whose preoperative evaluation
revealed a recurrence of a left maxillary sinusitis operated many years ago. The 
patient underwent meatotomy and drainage. Pathologic examination of the sinus
mucosa revealed the presence of septate and branched fungal hyphae invading the
blood vessels. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis was thus established and
the patient was treated by oral voriconazole. Our report describes the case of an
invasive chronic form of a fungal rhinosinusitis occurring in an
immunocompromised patient, and exposes the different forms of invasive fungal
rhinosinusitis. The diagnosis of an invasive form of fungal rhinusinusitis should
be suspected in immunocompromised patients in particular, but also in
immunocompetent patients. The appropriate treatment should be promptly set up,
given the bad prognosis of acute and fulminant cases.
