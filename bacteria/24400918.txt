Water-in-oil emulsions stabilized solely by bacterial cellulose nanofibers
(BCNs), which were hydrophobized by esterification with organic acids of various 
chain lengths (acetic acid, C2-; hexanoic acid, C6-; dodecanoic acid, C12-), were
produced and characterized. When using freeze-dried C6-BCN and C12-BCN, only a
maximum water volume fraction (ϕw) of 60% could be stabilized, while no emulsion 
was obtained for C2-BCN. However, the maximum ϕw increased to 71%, 81%, and 77%
for C2-BCN, C6-BCN, and C12-BCN, respectively, 150 h after the initial
emulsification, thereby creating high internal phase water-in-toluene emulsions. 
The observed time-dependent behavior of these emulsions is consistent with the
disentanglement and dispersion of freeze-dried modified BCN bundles into
individual nanofibers with time. These emulsions exhibited catastrophic phase
separation when ϕw was increased, as opposed to catastrophic phase inversion
observed for other Pickering emulsions.
