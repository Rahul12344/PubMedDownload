Bysspectin A (1), a polyketide-derived octaketide dimer with a novel carbon
skeleton, and two new precursor derivatives, bysspectins B and C (2 and 3), were 
obtained from an organic extract of the endophytic fungus Byssochlamys
spectabilis that had been isolated from a leaf tissue of the traditional Chinese 
medicinal plant Edgeworthia chrysantha, together with a known octaketide,
paecilocin A (4). Their structures were determined by HRMS, 1D and 2D NMR
spectroscopic analysis. A plausible route for their biosynthetic pathway is
proposed. Compounds 1-3 were tested for their antimicrobial activities. Only
compound 3 was weakly active against Escherichia coli and Staphyloccocus aureus
with MIC values of 32 and 64 μg/mL, respectively. Further, the inhibitory effects
on human carboxylesterases (hCE1, hCE2) of compounds 1 and 4 were evaluated. The 
results demonstrated that bysspectin A (1) was a novel and highly selective
inhibitor against hCE2 with the IC50 value of 2.01 μM. Docking simulation also
demonstrated that active compound 1 created interaction with the Ser-288 (the
catalytic amino-acid in the catalytic cavity) of hCE2 via hydrogen bonding,
revealing its highly selective inhibition toward hCE2.
