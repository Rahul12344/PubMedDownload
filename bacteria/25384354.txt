Submarine mud volcanoes are important sources of methane to the water column.
However, the temporal variability of their mud and methane emissions is unknown. 
Methane emissions were previously proposed to result from a dynamic equilibrium
between upward migration and consumption at the seabed by methane-consuming
microbes. Here we show non-steady-state situations of vigorous mud movement that 
are revealed through variations in fluid flow, seabed temperature and seafloor
bathymetry. Time series data for pressure, temperature, pH and seafloor
photography were collected over 431 days using a benthic observatory at the
active Håkon Mosby Mud Volcano. We documented 25 pulses of hot subsurface fluids,
accompanied by eruptions that changed the landscape of the mud volcano. Four
major events triggered rapid sediment uplift of more than a metre in height,
substantial lateral flow of muds at average velocities of 0.4 m per day, and
significant emissions of methane and CO₂ from the seafloor.
