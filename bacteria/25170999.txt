SLAMF9 is a member of the signaling lymphocyte-activating molecule (SLAM)
immunoreceptor family. The SLAM family receptors are expressed in a broad range
of immune cells and play an important role in immunity. To date, SLAMF9 is the
least studied member of this family. Its ligand, signaling properties, and cells 
on whose surface it is expressed are unknown. We generated hybridoma clones 6E11 
and 7G5 secreting monoclonal antibodies specific to human SLAMF9. BALB/c mice
were immunized with Escherichia coli-expressed purified SLAMF9 protein;
splenocytes from these mice were fused with mouse myeloma cell line NS-1. Based
on isotyping of the MAbs, clone 6E11 was referred to the IgG1 subclass, while 7G5
to IgG2b. The specificity of these MAbs was assessed by ELISA, immunoblotting,
immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. According to the results of epitope
analysis, clone 6E11 reacts with the C2-like domain, whereas 7G5 is specific to
the V-like domain of the SLAMF9 molecule. The generated MAbs were demonstrated to
be applicable in various immunochemical analyses. They may be useful tools in
studies clarifying the expression and function of human SLAMF9.
