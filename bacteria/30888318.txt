Plasmodium parasites possess a protein with homology to Niemann-Pick Type C1
proteins (Niemann-Pick Type C1-Related protein, NCR1). We isolated parasites with
resistance-conferring mutations in Plasmodium falciparum NCR1 (PfNCR1) during
selections with three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds and show that
the mutations are causative for compound resistance. PfNCR1 protein knockdown
results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the
compounds. Compound treatment or protein knockdown leads to increased sensitivity
of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to the amphipathic glycoside saponin and
engenders digestive vacuoles (DVs) that are small and malformed. Immuno-electron 
microscopy and split-GFP experiments localize PfNCR1 to the PPM. Our experiments 
show that PfNCR1 activity is critically important for the composition of the PPM 
and is required for DV biogenesis, suggesting PfNCR1 as a novel antimalarial drug
target.Editorial note: This article has been through an editorial process in
