A 20-kDa sperm membrane protein cDNA, designated as RSD-1, was isolated by
epitope selection from a rat testis lambda gtll expression library. RSD-1 was
used as a probe to screen a human testis lambda ZAPII cDNA expression library. A 
cDNA designated as BS-63 was isolated and found to consist of 1933 bp with an
open reading frame of 1824 bp and assigned the accession number U64675 by
GenBank. The deduced polypeptide consisted of 608 amino acid residues containing 
XFXFG or FG motifs that are characteristic of nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins
and act as potential binding sites for Ran. The N-terminal region has high
homology with RanBP2/Nup358, a nucleoporin component, showing that BS-63 is a
member of the NPC family. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs prepared from various
human tissues shows that BS-63 is transcribed in two forms: 6.0 and 8.5 kb. The
8.5-kb transcript was present in low amounts in several somatic tissues, whereas 
the 6.0-kb transcript is expressed only in testis. In situ hybridization analysis
of human testis sections showed that BS-63 mRNA is expressed only in germ cells
at all stages of spermatogenesis. Sertoli cells did not transcribe the gene.
