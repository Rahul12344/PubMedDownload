OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To investigate the therapeutic effect of E5564 (a
clinically used TLR4 inhibitor) in murine abdominal sepsis elicited by
intraperitoneal infection with a highly virulent Escherichia coli in the context 
of concurrent antibiotic therapy.
METHODS: Mice were infected with different doses (~2 × 10(4)-2 × 10(6) CFU) of E.
coli O18:K1 and treated after 8 h with ceftriaxone 20 mg/kg i.p. combined with
either E5564 10 mg/kg i.v. or vehicle. For survival studies this treatment was
repeated every 12 h. Bacterial loads and inflammatory parameters were determined 
after 20 h in peritoneal lavage fluid, blood, liver and lung tissue. Plasma
creatinin, AST, ALT and LDH were determined to assess organ injury.
RESULTS: E5564 impaired bacterial clearance under the antibiotic regime after
infection with a low dose E. coli (1.7 × 10(4) CFU) while renal function was
slightly preserved. No differences were observed in bacterial load and organ
damage after infection with a tenfold higher (1.7 × 10(5) E. coli) bacterial
dose. While treatment with E5564 slightly attenuated inflammatory markers
provoked by the sublethal doses of 104-105 E. coli under the antibiotic regime,
it did not affect lethality evoked by infection with 1.7 × 106 E. coli.
CONCLUSIONS: The impact of TLR4 inhibition during abdominal sepsis by virulent E.
coli bacteria is only beneficial at low infection grade at cost of bactericidal
activity.
