The enzymes NAD-dependent beta-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (BHBD) and
3-hydroxyacetyl coenzyme A (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA) dehydrogenase are part of the
central fermentation pathways for butyrate and butanol production in the
gram-positive anaerobic bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum and for the beta
oxidation of fatty acids in eucaryotes, respectively. The C. acetobutylicum hbd
gene encoding a bacterial BHBD was cloned, expressed, and sequenced in
Escherichia coli. The deduced primary amino acid sequence of the C.
acetobutylicum BHBD showed 45.9% similarity with the equivalent mitochondrial
fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme and 38.4% similarity with the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase part of the bifunctional enoyl-CoA hydratase:3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase from rat peroxisomes. The pig mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase showed 31.7% similarity with the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase
part of the bifunctional enzyme from rat peroxisomes. The phylogenetic
relationship between these enzymes supports a common evolutionary origin for the 
fatty acid beta-oxidation pathways of vertebrate mitochondria and peroxisomes and
the bacterial fermentation pathway.
