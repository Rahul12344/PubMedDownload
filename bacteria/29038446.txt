An external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for pneumococcal serotype
identification has been performed over a period of 11 years, by a network of
European pneumococcal reference laboratories. We report the results from the EQA,
and present an assessment of the acceptability and utility of the EQA scheme.
Reports from 22 EQA panels distributed in 2005-2016 were analysed. Each EQA panel
consisted of seven isolates. A questionnaire including seven questions related to
the acceptability and utility of the EQA scheme was distributed to all
participating laboratories. Altogether, 154 pneumococcal isolates were tested. Of
the 92 serologically distinct serotypes currently defined, 49 serotypes were
included in the rounds. Discrepant results were observed in eight EQA rounds,
involving 11 isolates (7.1%, 95% CI: 4% to 12%). All participating laboratories
reported that the EQA scheme was useful for quality assurance purposes. Our
results show that comparable serotyping data can be obtained in different
laboratories. The EQA participation helps to keep the typing procedures at a high
standard and provides data for accreditation purposes. The EQA is helpful when
new technologies are introduced, and reveal limitations of both genotypic and
phenotypic methods. Continuation of the presented EQA scheme is planned.
