Objective: The Fas/Fas ligand (FASL) system and Elabela-apelin receptor signaling
pathways are implicated in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. The aim of the
current study was to investigate whether a model combining the measurement of
sFas and Elabela in the maternal circulation may serve as a clinical biomarker
for early- and/or late-onset preeclampsia more effectively than measures of each 
biomarker individually.Methods: Blood samples were collected from 214 women in
the following groups: (1) normal pregnancy sampled <34 weeks of gestation
(n = 56); (2) patients who developed early-onset preeclampsia (n = 54); (3)
normal pregnancy sampled ≥34 weeks of gestation (n = 52); (4) patients who
developed late-onset preeclampsia (n = 52). Maternal circulating soluble Fas and 
Elabela concentrations were determined using sensitive and validated
immunoassays. Two sample t-tests, multivariate logistic regression, and receiver 
operating characteristic curves were used for analyses.Results: (1) Women with
early-onset preeclampsia, and those with late-onset preeclampsia with placental
lesions of maternal vascular malperfusion, had increased concentrations of sFas
compared to their gestational age-matched normal controls; (2) women with
late-onset preeclampsia, but not those with early-onset preeclampsia, had
increased concentrations of Elabela compared to their gestational age-matched
counterparts; and (3) an increase in both Elabela and sFas concentrations was
more strongly associated with late-onset preeclampsia than early-onset
preeclampsia relative to models including either of the markers
alone.Conclusions: A combined model of maternal sFas and Elabela concentrations
provides a stronger association with late-onset preeclampsia than either protein 
alone. This finding demonstrates the possibility to improve the classification of
late-onset preeclampsia by combining the results of both molecular biomarkers.
