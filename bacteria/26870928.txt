Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease,
which in the majority of patients progresses to liver transplantation or death.
To date, no medical treatment has been proven to be of benefit, although
ursodeoxycholic acid is widely used. The etiopathogenesis of PSC is unclear,
although it is associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Various hypotheses
have been suggested, which have led to different therapeutic strategies. Recent
studies have suggested that the microbiome may play a role in PSC, raising the
possibility of efficacy of antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation.
Gut-homing T cells may be important in the pathogenesis of PSC, and several
agents are in development, targeting various receptors, integrins, and ligands on
this pathway, including VAP-1, MAdCAM-1, α4β7, and CCR9. Nuclear receptor
agonists such as obeticholic acid and fibrates hold promise, as do other
therapies that alter bile acid composition such as norUDCA. Antifibrotic agents
such as Loxl2 inhibitors are also being assessed. In conclusion, it is likely
that an effective drug therapy for PSC will become available over the next
decade.
