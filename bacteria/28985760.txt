BACKGROUND: Xenotransplantation of patient-derived AML (acute myeloid leukemia)
cells in NOD-scid Il2rÎ³ null (NSG) mice is the method of choice for evaluating
this human hematologic malignancy. However, existing models constructed using
intravenous injection in adult or newborn NSG mice have inferior engraftment
efficiency, poor peripheral blood engraftment, or are difficult to construct.
METHODS: Here, we describe an improved AML xenograft model where primary human
AML cells were injected into NSG newborn pups intrahepatically.
RESULTS: Introduction of primary cells from AML patients resulted in high levels 
of engraftment in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow (BM) of recipient
mice. The phenotype of engrafted AML cells remained unaltered during serial
transplantation. The mice developed features that are consistent with human AML
including spleen enlargement and infiltration of AML cells into multiple organs. 
Importantly, we demonstrated that although leukemic stem cell activity is
enriched and mediated by CD34+CD117+ subpopulation, CD34+CD117- subpopulation can
acquire CD34+CD117+ phenotype through de-differentiation. Lastly, we evaluated
the therapeutic potential of Sorafenib and Regorafenib in this AML model and
found that periphery and spleen AML cells are sensitive to these treatments,
whereas BM provides a protective environment to AML.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our improved model is robust, easy-to-construct, and
reliable for pre-clinical AML studies.
