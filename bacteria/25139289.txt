Although the mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of NK cells on tumor
cells and intracellular bacteria have been studied extensively, it remains
unclear how these cells kill extracellular bacterial pathogens. In this study, we
examine how human NK cells kill Mycobacterium kansasii and M.tb. The underlying
mechanism is contact dependent and requires two cytolytic proteins: perforin and 
granulysin. Mycobacteria induce enhanced expression of the cytolytic proteins via
activation of the NKG2D/NCR cell-surface receptors and intracellular signaling
pathways involving ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. These results suggest that NK cells
use similar cellular mechanisms to kill both bacterial pathogens and target host 
cells. This report reveals a novel role for NK cells, perforin, and granulysin in
killing mycobacteria and highlights a potential alternative defense mechanism
that the immune system can use against mycobacterial infection.
