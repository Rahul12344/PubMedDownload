DC-UbP/UBTD2 is a ubiquitin (Ub) domain-containing protein first identified from 
dendritic cells, and is implicated in ubiquitination pathway. The solution
structure and backbone dynamics of the C-terminal Ub-like (UbL) domain were
elucidated in our previous work. To further understand the biological function of
DC-UbP, we then solved the solution structure of the N-terminal domain of DC-UbP 
(DC-UbP_N) and studied its Ub binding properties by NMR techniques. The results
show that DC-UbP_N holds a novel structural fold and acts as a Ub-binding domain 
(UBD) but with low affinity. This implies that the DC-UbP protein, composing of a
combination of both UbL and UBD domains, might play an important role in
regulating protein ubiquitination and delivery of ubiquitinated substrates in
eukaryotic cells.
