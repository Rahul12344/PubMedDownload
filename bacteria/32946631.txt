AIM: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) family cytokines promote the host defence against
mycobacterial infections. We have previously shown an association between IL17A
variations and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) osteitis. This paper evaluates the 
association of three IL17F polymorphisms with BCG osteitis after newborn
vaccination.
METHODS: IL17F rs763780, rs11465553 and rs7741835 single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were studied in 132 adults, who presented with BCG osteitis in infancy.
The genotypes and minor allele frequencies (MAFs) were compared between cases and
Finnish population-based controls (N = 99) from the 1000 Genomes Project, and
MAFs were compared between cases and allele data of Finnish subjects from the
large Genome Aggregation Database.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between former BCG osteitis
patients and population-based controls in the IL17F rs763780 (wild 84.4% vs
84.8%), rs11465553 (86.4% vs 91.9%) or rs7741835 (65.7% vs 67.7%) genotypes.
Homozygous variant genotypes were only present in 1.5%, 0.8% and 3.8% of cases,
respectively. Likewise, MAFs of the three IL17F SNPs did not substantially differ
from those of 11 252, 11 939 and 1371 Finnish subjects, respectively, from the
available Genome Aggregation Database.
CONCLUSION: IL17F rs763780, rs11465553 and rs7741835 variations showed no
association with the risk of BCG osteitis after newborn vaccination.
