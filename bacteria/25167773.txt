Zhuang ethnic minority is the largest minority group in China. Here, we report
for the first time the polymorphisms of MICA and MICB in a healthy Zhuang
population of 209 unrelated individuals. Using polymerase chain reaction-sequence
specific priming (PCR-SSP) and sequencing-based typing (PCR-SBT), 13
MICA-sequence alleles and 5 MICA-STR alleles, as well as 11 MICB alleles were
detected, among which MICA(∗)010, MICA(∗)A5 and MICB(∗)005:02 were the most
frequent alleles. Linkage disequilibria was investigated and the most common
two-locus haplotypes were MICB(∗)005:02-MICA(∗)010 and MICB(∗)014-MICA(∗)045.
These results suggest informative genetic markers for investigating origins and
evolution of MHC class I region haplotypes in Zhuang population.
