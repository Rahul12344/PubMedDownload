Neutrophils require directional cues to navigate through the complex structure of
venular walls and into inflamed tissues. Here we applied confocal intravital
microscopy to analyze neutrophil emigration in cytokine-stimulated mouse
cremaster muscles. We identified differential and non-redundant roles for the
chemokines CXCL1 and CXCL2, governed by their distinct cellular sources. CXCL1
was produced mainly by TNF-stimulated endothelial cells (ECs) and pericytes and
supported luminal and sub-EC neutrophil crawling. Conversely, neutrophils were
the main producers of CXCL2, and this chemokine was critical for correct
breaching of endothelial junctions. This pro-migratory activity of CXCL2 depended
on the atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1), which is enriched within
endothelial junctions. Transmigrating neutrophils promoted a self-guided
migration response through EC junctions, creating a junctional chemokine "depot" 
in the form of ACKR1-presented CXCL2 that enabled efficient unidirectional
luminal-to-abluminal migration. Thus, CXCL1 and CXCL2 act in a sequential manner 
to guide neutrophils through venular walls as governed by their distinct cellular
sources.
