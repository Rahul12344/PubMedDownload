Studies of lipid reactive CD1d-restricted T cells have focussed on
α-galactosylceramide reactive semi-invariant Type I NKT cells, which influence a 
broad range of immune responses. Much less is known about other CD1d-restricted T
cells with respect to TCR diversity, function, the types of antigens they
recognize and how they specifically recognize antigens presented by CD1d. In this
review, we reflect on recent literature that highlights unexpected complexity
within the pool of CD1d-restricted T cells and emphasize how TCR diversity
greatly broadens the scope of antigen recognition.
