BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell renewal and differentiation are regulated
through epigenetic processes. The conversion of 5-methylcytosine into
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) by ten-eleven-translocation enzymes provides new
insights into the epigenetic regulation of gene expression during development.
Here, we studied the potential gene regulatory role of 5hmC during human
hematopoiesis.
RESULTS: We used reduced representation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine profiling
(RRHP) to characterize 5hmC distribution in CD34+ cells, CD4+ T cells, CD19+ B
cells, CD14+ monocytes and granulocytes. In all analyzed blood cell types, the
presence of 5hmC at gene bodies correlates positively with gene expression, and
highest 5hmC levels are found around transcription start sites of highly
expressed genes. In CD34+ cells, 5hmC primes for the expression of genes
regulating myeloid and lymphoid lineage commitment. Throughout blood cell
differentiation, intragenic 5hmC is maintained at genes that are highly expressed
and required for acquisition of the mature blood cell phenotype. Moreover, in
CD34+ cells, the presence of 5hmC at enhancers associates with increased binding 
of RUNX1 and FLI1, transcription factors essential for hematopoiesis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a comprehensive genome-wide overview of 5hmC
distribution in human hematopoietic cells and new insights into the epigenetic
regulation of gene expression during human hematopoiesis.
