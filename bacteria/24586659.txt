Innate immune sensors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) differentially utilize
adaptor proteins and additional molecular mediators to ensure robust and precise 
immune responses to pathogen challenge. Through a gain-of-function genetic
screen, we identified the gamma catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1
(PP1-γ) as a positive regulator of MyD88-dependent proinflammatory innate immune 
activation. PP1-γ physically interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, and
enhances the activity of TRAF6 towards itself and substrates such as IKKγ,
whereas enzymatically inactive PP1-γ represses these events. Importantly, these
activities were found to be critical for cellular innate responses to pathogen
challenge and microbial clearance in both mouse macrophages and human monocyte
lines. These data indicate that PP1-γ phosphatase activity regulates overall
TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase function and promotes NF-κB-mediated innate signaling
responses.
