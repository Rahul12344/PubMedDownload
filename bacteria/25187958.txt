Given the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens, antimicrobial
peptides that can also modulate the immune response may be a novel approach for
effectively controlling periodontal infections. In the present study, we used a
three-dimensional (3D) co-culture model of gingival epithelial cells and
fibroblasts stimulated with Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of human
beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) and cathelicidin (LL-37) and to determine whether these
antimicrobial peptides can act in synergy. The 3D co-culture model composed of
gingival fibroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix overlaid with gingival
epithelial cells had a synergistic effect with respect to the secretion of IL-6
and IL-8 in response to LPS stimulation compared to fibroblasts and epithelial
cells alone. The 3D co-culture model was stimulated with non-cytotoxic
concentrations of hBD-3 (10 and 20 µM) and LL-37 (0.1 and 0.2 µM) individually
and in combination in the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS. A multiplex
ELISA assay was used to quantify the secretion of 41 different cytokines. hBD-3
and LL-37 acted in synergy to reduce the secretion of GRO-alpha, G-CSF, IP-10,
IL-6, and MCP-1, but only had an additive effect on reducing the secretion of
IL-8 in response to A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS stimulation. The present study
showed that hBD-3 acted in synergy with LL-37 to reduce the secretion of
cytokines by an LPS-stimulated 3D model of gingival mucosa. This combination of
antimicrobial peptides thus shows promising potential as an adjunctive therapy
for treating inflammatory periodontitis.
