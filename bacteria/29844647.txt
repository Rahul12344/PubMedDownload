Background: Apelin, an endogenous peptide, has recently gained attention due to
its positive inotropic effects in heart failure physiopathology. We investigated 
the relationship between serum apelin levels and the severity of calcific aortic 
stenosis (AS).
Methods: A total of 68 consecutive patients diagnosed with calcific AS and a
control group of 32 subjects were included in the study. The subjects were
divided into three group as follows: the control group, the mild-moderate AS
group and the severe AS group. Blood samples were obtained from all of the
subjects, which were used for biochemical comparisons of apelin 36 and
high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels.
Results: Plasma apelin 36 levels were significantly lower in the patients with
severe AS [490 (247-1074) pg/ml] compared to both the mild-moderate AS [209
(97-453) pg/ml] and control [660 (378-1200) pg/ml] groups (p < 0.001).
Correlation analysis between the left ventricular mass index and apelin
concentrations revealed a significant negative correlation between the two
parameters (p < 0.001, r = -0.478).
Conclusions: Our study demonstrated decreased apelin levels and increased hsCRP
concentrations in patients with severe calcific AS. Our findings may help to
clarify the exact pathophysiologic role of apelin in cardiovascular diseases.
