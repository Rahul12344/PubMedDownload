BACKGROUND: Interrogation of site-specific CpG methylation in circulating tumor
DNAs (ctDNAs) has been employed in a number of studies for early detection of
breast cancer (BrCa). In many of these studies, the markers were identified based
on known biology of BrCa progression, and interrogated using methyl-specific PCR 
(MSP), a technique involving bisulfite conversion, PCR, and qPCR.
METHODS: In this report, we are demonstrating the development of a novel assay
(Multiplex Bisulfite PCR-LDR-qPCR) which can potentially offer improvements to
MSP, by integrating additional steps such as ligase detection reaction (LDR),
methylated CpG target enrichment, carryover protection (use of uracil DNA
glycosylase), and minimization of primer-dimer formation (use of ribose primers
and RNAseH2). The assay is designed to for breast cancer-specific CpG markers
identified through integrated analyses of publicly available genome-wide
methylation datasets for 31 types of primary tumors (including BrCa), as well as 
matching normal tissues, and peripheral blood.
RESULTS: Our results indicate that the PCR-LDR-qPCR assay is capable of detecting
~ 30 methylated copies of each of 3 BrCa-specific CpG markers, when mixed with
excess amount unmethylated CpG markers (~ 3000 copies each), which is a
reasonable approximation of BrCa ctDNA overwhelmed with peripheral blood
cell-free DNA (cfDNA) when isolated from patient plasma. The
bioinformatically-identified CpG markers are located in promoter regions of NR5A2
and PRKCB, and a non-coding region of chromosome 1 (upstream of EFNA3).
Additional bioinformatic analyses would reveal that these methylation markers are
independent of patient race and age, and positively associated with signaling
pathways associated with BrCa progression (such as those related to retinoid
nuclear receptor, PTEN, p53, pRB, and p27).
CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates the potential utilization of bisulfite
PCR-LDR-qPCR assay, along with bioinformatically-driven biomarker discovery, in
blood-based BrCa detection.
