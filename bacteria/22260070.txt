To obtain large quantity of human leukocyte antigen F (HLA-F) and cluster of
differentiation 8alpha homodimers (CD8alphaalpha) proteins and to study their
relationship, HLA-F and CD8alpha genes with rare codon in Escherichia coli were
cloned using an N-terminal synonymous mutation method. High-efficiency expression
protein inclusion bodies were acquired. The proteins were refolded using the
dilution method and purified with gel-filtration and anion exchange
chromatography. The results of gel-filtration and native-PAGE indicate that HLA-F
interacts with CD8alphaalpha. This interaction may affect the binding between
CD8alphaalpha and other MHC molecules to regulate immune responses. These results
provide a basis for further research of HLA-F.
