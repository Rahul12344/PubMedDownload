BACKGROUND: Aim of this cross-sectional study was the investigation of
associations between different rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related blood parameters
and periodontal condition as well as selected periodontal pathogenic bacteria in 
RA patients under methotrexate (MTX) immunosuppression.
METHODS: Periodontal probing depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BOP) and clinical 
attachment loss (CAL) were assessed. Periodontal condition was classified into:
no/mild and moderate or severe periodontitis (P). Prevalence of selected
periodontal pathogenic bacteria and concentration of matrix metalloproteinase 8
(MMP-8) was assessed from the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) using PCR and
ELISA, respectively. Blood samples were analyzed for the concentration of
selected rheumatoid parameters.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: t-test, Mann-Whitney-U-Test, exact Fisher tests or chi
square test (p < 0.05).
RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (mean age 55.07 years, 34 P, 22 no P) were included. 
While prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria was higher in P patients, no 
substantial association of bacteria with blood parameters was found. In
periodontal diseased participants, MMP-8 concentration in GCF (6.22 ± 7.01 vs.
15.99 ± 13.49; p < 0.01) and blood (2.60 ± 3.57 vs. 5.52 ± 5.92; p < 0.01) was
increased, while no correlation between GCF and blood was found (Spearman's rho: 
0.175; p = 0.23). Furthermore, higher blood concentrations of MMP-8 and tissue
inhibitor of MMP (TIMP-1) were detected in patients with increased periodontal
inflammation (BOP positive, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Periodontal inflammation appears associated to MMP-8 and TIMP-1 in
blood. Thereby, clinical interaction between periodontal conditions, periodontal 
pathogenic bacteria and RA-related cytokines remain unclear.
