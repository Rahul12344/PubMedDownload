Fimbrial antigens of Escherichia coli 01:K1:H7 and 01:K1:H- strains isolated from
patients with urinary tract infections.

Nimmich W, Zingler G, Orskov I.

Thirty E. coli strains belonging to serotypes 01:K1:H7 and 01:K1:H- were examined
for the presence of fimbrial (F) antigens by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. All
strains exhibited a mannose-resistant haemagglutination of human and monkey
erythrocytes. This ability was found to be highly correlated with the existence
of F antigens. Another correlation was found between O:K:H serotype and F
antigen. Eleven 01:K1:H7 strains were associated with fimbrial antigen F11 which 
was also demonstrated in five immotile variants of this serotype. In other
fourteen strains of serotype 01:K1:H-, however, the F9 antigen could be detected.
The F9 and F11 antigens belong to the group of P fimbriae. The 01:K1:H7:F11 and
01:K1:H-:F9 isolates were supposed to be of different clonal origin.
