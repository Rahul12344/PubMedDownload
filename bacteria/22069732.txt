Bacillus anthracis, similar to other bacterial pathogens, has evolved effective
immune evasion strategies to prolong its survival in the host, thus ensuring the 
unchecked spread of the infection. This function is subserved by lethal (LT) and 
edema (ET) toxins, two exotoxins produced by vegetative anthrax bacilli following
germination of the spores. The structure of these toxins and the mechanism of
cell intoxication are topics covered by other reviews in this issue. Here we
shall discuss how B. anthracis uses LT and ET to suppress the immune defenses of 
the host, focusing on T lymphocytes, the key players in adaptive immunity. We
shall also summarize recent findings showing that, depending on its
concentration, ET has the ability not only to suppress T cell activation but also
to promote the polarization of CD4(+) T cells to the Th2 and Th17 subsets,
highlighting the potential use of this toxin as an immunomodulator.
