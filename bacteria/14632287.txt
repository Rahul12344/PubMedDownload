Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 is the producer of the A40926 complex of
lipoglycopeptide antibiotics which contain chlorine atoms in amino acids 3 and 6 
of the peptide backbone. Using a classical mutagenesis and selection approach we 
have isolated a Nonomuraea sp. ATCC 39727 mutant strain able to direct production
towards new A40926 analogues dechloro-A40926 (DDC) lacking two chlorine atoms and
the two monochloro-A40926 (MDC1 and MDC2) that are not produced fermenting the
wild type strain. Dechlorinated A40926 derivatives were obtained in considerable 
amount in a standard fermentation process and were purified and chemically
characterized. The dechlorinated A40926 derivatives DDC and MDC2 showed improved 
antimicrobial activity against coagulase negative staphylococci strains in
respect to A40926 complex. Dechlorinated derivatives of the related antibiotic
teicoplanin are also reported in the literature and are generally less active
than the parental products.
