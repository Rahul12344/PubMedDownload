The Akt serine/threonine kinase is required for the survival of many cell types
and for transformation of hematopoietic cells by the BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine
kinase. Analysis of the potential mechanisms whereby Akt promotes survival of
hematopoietic cells revealed that it induced the activity of plasma membrane and 
mitochondrial Raf-1 in a Ras-independent, but PKC-dependent manner. Inhibition of
plasma membrane Raf-1-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase activity had no 
effect on the enhanced survival of cells expressing Akt. By contrast, suppression
of mitochondrial Raf-1 enzymatic activity by expression of a
mitochondria-targeted Raf-1 dominant-negative mutant rendered Akt-expressing
cells susceptible to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation and was
accompanied by inhibition of BAD, but not mitogen-activated protein kinase,
phosphorylation. Together, these data indicate that PKC-dependent activation of
Raf-1 plays an important role in Akt-dependent antiapoptotic effects.
