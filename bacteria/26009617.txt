BACKGROUND: Several nonclinical drug-development tools (DDTs) have been used for 
antituberculosis drug development over several decades. The role of the DDTs used
for evaluating the efficacy of antituberculosis drug combinations and the gaps in
the evidence base for which new tools or approaches are needed are as yet
undefined.
METHODS: We performed a landscape analysis based on a comprehensive literature
review to create evidence based guidelines.
RESULTS: There are 3 important questions that a DDT should answer with regard to 
antituberculosis drugs: What combination(s) of drugs will be most effective? What
dose(s) and schedule(s) of each drug should be administered? and What duration(s)
of treatment will be efficacious? Four DDTs were identified as having a track
record to answer these questions: in vitro susceptibility tests, the hollow fiber
system model of tuberculosis, mice, and guinea pigs. No single nonclinical in
vitro or animal model recapitulates all aspects of human tuberculosis. Therefore,
a combination of models is recommended for drug development. Gaps identified
include the need for standardization of nonclinical model experiments, evaluation
of animal models with pathology more similar to that in humans, and
identification of experimental quantitative output in the DDTs that correlates
with sterilizing effect in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for formal quantitative analyses of how well DDTs
forecast clinical outcomes.
