Long-term mechanical circulatory support (LT-MCS) is an important treatment
modality for patients with severe heart failure. Different devices are available,
and many-sometimes contradictory-observations regarding patient selection,
surgical techniques, perioperative management and follow-up have been published. 
With the growing expertise in this field, the European Association for
Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) recognized a need for a structured
multidisciplinary consensus about the approach to patients with LT-MCS. However, 
the evidence published so far is insufficient to allow for generation of
meaningful guidelines complying with EACTS requirements. Instead, the EACTS
presents an expert opinion in the LT-MCS field. This expert opinion addresses
patient evaluation and preoperative optimization as well as management of cardiac
and non-cardiac comorbidities. Further, extensive operative implantation
techniques are summarized and evaluated by leading experts, depending on both
patient characteristics and device selection. The faculty recognized that
postoperative management is multidisciplinary and includes aspects of intensive
care unit stay, rehabilitation, ambulatory care, myocardial recovery and
end-of-life care and mirrored this fact in this paper. Additionally, the opinions
of experts on diagnosis and management of adverse events including bleeding,
cerebrovascular accidents and device malfunction are presented. In this expert
consensus, the evidence for the complete management from patient selection to
end-of-life care is carefully reviewed with the aim of guiding clinicians in
optimizing management of patients considered for or supported by an LT-MCS
device.
