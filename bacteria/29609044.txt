Synthetic biology techniques hold great promise for optimising the production of 
natural products by microorganisms. However, evaluating the phenotype of a
modified bacterium represents a major bottleneck to the engineering cycle -
particularly for antibiotic-producing actinobacteria strains, which grow slowly
and are challenging to genetically manipulate. Here, we report the generation and
application of antibiotic-specific whole-cell biosensor derived from TetR
transcriptional repressor for use in identifying and optimising antibiotic
producers. The constructed biosensor was successfully used to improve production 
of polyketide antibiotic pamamycin. However, an initial biosensor based on native
genetic elements had inadequate dynamic and operating ranges. To overcome these
limitations, we fine-tuned biosensor performance through alterations of the
promoter and operator of output module and the ligand affinity of transcription
factor module, which enabled us to deduce recommendations for building and
application of actinobacterial biosensors.
