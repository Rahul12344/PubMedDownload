Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by bone marrow
failure (BMF), developmental abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. Together
with other proteins involved in DNA repair processes and cell division, the FA
proteins maintain genome homeostasis, and germline mutation of any one of the
genes that encode FA proteins causes FA. Monoallelic inactivation of some FA
genes, such as FA complementation group D1 (FANCD1; also known as the breast and 
ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2), leads to adult-onset cancer
predisposition but does not cause FA, and somatic mutations in FA genes occur in 
cancers in the general population. Carcinogenesis resulting from a dysregulated
FA pathway is multifaceted, as FA proteins monitor multiple complementary
genome-surveillance checkpoints throughout interphase, where monoubiquitylation
of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the FA core complex promotes recruitment of
DNA repair effectors to chromatin lesions to resolve DNA damage and mitosis. In
this Review, we discuss how the FA pathway safeguards genome integrity throughout
the cell cycle and show how studies of FA have revealed opportunities to develop 
rational therapeutics for this genetic disease and for malignancies that acquire 
somatic mutations within the FA pathway.
