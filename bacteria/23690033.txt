The C2 domain of streptococcal protein G is a small (55 residue) peptide with
immunoglobulin-binding activity. Following codon optimization, the gene was
divided into four oligonucleotide fragments and amplified by overlap PCR. The
recombinant plasmid pET30a-C2 was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3)
PLysS for expression. After purification by Ni-NTA, the fusion protein was
identified by western-blotting, Dot-ELISA and ELISA. His-tagged C2 bound to
human, rabbit, cattle, pig, goat, mouse or guinea pig IgG had no affinity for
goose, duck, wild duck, wild turkey and red-crowned crane IgY. Its affinity for
chicken IgY, however, was comparable to that of guinea pig IgG. The C2 domain may
therefore provide an ideal material for the purification and detection of
immunoglobulin G from various mammals.
