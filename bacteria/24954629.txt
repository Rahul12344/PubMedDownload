Dendrimers are unique highly branched macromolecules with numerous groundbreaking
biomedical applications under development. Here we identified poly(amido amine)
(PAMAM) dendrimers as novel blockers for the pore-forming B components of the
binary anthrax toxin (PA63) and Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin (C2IIa). These
pores are essential for delivery of the enzymatic A components of the
internalized toxins from endosomes into the cytosol of target cells. We
demonstrate that at low μM concentrations cationic PAMAM dendrimers block PA63
and C2IIa to inhibit channel-mediated transport of the A components, thereby
protecting HeLa and Vero cells from intoxication. By channel reconstitution and
high-resolution current recording, we show that the PAMAM dendrimers obstruct
transmembrane PA63 and C2IIa pores in planar lipid bilayers at nM concentrations.
These findings suggest a new potential role for the PAMAM dendrimers as effective
polyvalent channel-blocking inhibitors, which can protect human target cells from
intoxication with binary toxins from pathogenic bacteria.
