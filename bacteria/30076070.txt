BACKGROUND AIMS: CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer (iNK) T cells are rare 
regulatory T cells that may contribute to the immune-regulation in allogeneic
stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Here, we sought to develop an effective
strategy to expand human iNK T cells for use in cell therapy to prevent
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in ASCT.
METHODS: Human iNK T cells were first enriched from peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) using magnetic-activated cell sorting separation, then co-cultured 
with dendritic cells in the presence of agonist glycolipids,
alpha-galactosylceramide, for 2 weeks.
RESULTS: The single antigenic stimulation reliably expanded iNK T cells to an
average of 2.8 × 107 per 5 × 108 PBMCs in an average purity of 98.8% in 2 weeks
(N = 24). The expanded iNK T cells contained a significantly higher level of CD4+
and central memory phenotype (CD45RA-CD62L+) compared with freshly isolated iNK T
cells, and maintained their ability to produce both Th-1 (interferon [IFN]γ and
tumor necrosis factor [TNF]α) and Th-2 type cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5
and IL-13) upon antigenic stimulation or stimulation with Phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate/ionomycin. Interestingly, expanded iNK T cells were highly
autoreactive and produced a Th-2 polarized cytokine production profile after
being co-cultured with dendritic cells alone without exogenous agonist glycolipid
antigen. Lastly, expanded iNK T cells suppressed conventional T-cell
proliferation and ameliorated xenograft GVHD (hazard ratio, 0.1266; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a feasible approach for obtaining ex vivo
expanded, highly enriched human iNK T cells for use in adoptive cell therapy to
prevent GVHD in ASCT.
