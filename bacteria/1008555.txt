Microbial oxidation and assimilation of propylene.

Cerniglia CE, Blevins WT, Perry JJ.

Hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms in our culture collection oxidized propylene
but could not utilize it as the sole source of carbon and energy. When
propane-grown cells of Mycobacterium convulutum were placed on propylene,
acrylate, the terminally oxidized, three-carbon unsaturated acid, accumulated. A 
mixed culture and an axenic culture (strain PL-1) that utilized propylene as the 
sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from soil. Respiration rates,
enzyme assays, fatty acid profiles, and 14CO2 incorporation experiments suggest
that both the mixed culture and strain PL-1 oxidize propylene via attack at the
double bond, resulting in a C2+C1 cleavage of the molecule.
