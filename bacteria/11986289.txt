Seventeen volunteers received an intravenous bolus of endotoxin (2 ng/kg of body 
weight). Endotoxin-induced lymphopenia was constituted mainly by cells with an
immature phenotype (CD45RA(+) CD45RO(-)) that were less likely to undergo
apoptosis (CD28(+)), whereas cells with the highest rates of disappearance were
characterized by an activated phenotype (CD45RA(-) CD45RO(+)) as well as a
phenotype linked to apoptosis (CD95(+) CD28(-)). In conclusion, endotoxin-induced
lymphopenia reflects the disappearance from the circulation of activated
lymphocytes prone to undergo apoptosis.
