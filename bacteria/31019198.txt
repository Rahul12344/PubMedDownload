Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by defective Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein. Morbidity is mainly due to early airway
infection. We hypothesized that S. aureus clearance during the first hours of
infection was impaired in CF human Airway Surface Liquid (ASL) because of a
lowered pH. The ASL pH of human bronchial epithelial cell lines and primary
respiratory cells from healthy controls (WT) and patients with CF was measured
with a pH microelectrode. The antimicrobial capacity of airway cells was studied 
after S. aureus apical infection by counting surviving bacteria. ASL was
significantly more acidic in CF than in WT respiratory cells. This was consistent
with a defect in bicarbonate secretion involving CFTR and SLC26A4 (pendrin) and a
persistent proton secretion by ATP12A. ASL demonstrated a defect in S. aureus
clearance which was improved by pH normalization. Pendrin inhibition in WT
airways recapitulated the CF airway defect and increased S. aureus proliferation.
ATP12A inhibition by ouabain decreased bacterial proliferation. Antimicrobial
peptides LL-37 and hBD1 demonstrated a pH-dependent activity. Normalizing ASL pH 
might improve innate airway defense in newborns with CF during onset of S. aureus
infection. Pendrin activation and ATP12A inhibition could represent novel
therapeutic strategies to normalize pH in CF airways.
