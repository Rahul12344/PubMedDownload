Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is an attractive target for anti-fibrotic therapy 
because it attenuates excessive transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) which
plays an important role in hepatic fibrosis. In the study, we reported on the
isolation and molecular cloning of the open reading frame (ORF) of guinea pig HGF
(gHGF), encoding a protein of 729 amino acids, with an apple-like (hairpin)
domain, four kringle domains and a trypsin-like serine protease domain. Moreover,
the truncated variant of gHGF (a double mutant of N-terminal hairpin and first
kringle domains of gHGF, K132E and G134E, gmNK1) protein fused with His6 tag, the
molecular weight of which was about 20.0kDa, which was expressed in Escherichia
coli BL21 (DE3) and purified with Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Furthermore,
gmNK1 inhibited protein expression levels of fibrosis-related type I collagen
(Col I) and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) genes in TGF-β1-activated HSC-T6 cells 
and CCl4-induced liver fibrosis in rat. In addition, gmNK1 ameliorated liver
morphology and fibrotic responses in fibrosis animal. Taken together, we first
reported on the sequence of HGF from guinea pig and determined the anti-fibrotic 
activity of gmNK1 in hepatic fibrosis, which will be helpful for investigations
into the biological roles of gHGF in this important animal model.
