AlkB is a bacterial Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that repairs
a wide range of alkylated nucleobases in DNA and RNA as part of the adaptive
response to exogenous nucleic acid-alkylating agents. Although there has been
longstanding interest in the structure and specificity of Escherichia coli AlkB
and its homologs, difficulties in assaying their repair activities have limited
our understanding of their substrate specificities and kinetic mechanisms. Here, 
we used quantitative kinetic approaches to determine the transient kinetics of
recognition and repair of alkylated DNA by AlkB. These experiments revealed that 
AlkB is a much faster alkylation repair enzyme than previously reported and that 
it is significantly faster than DNA repair glycosylases that recognize and excise
some of the same base lesions. We observed that whereas 1,N 6-ethenoadenine can
be repaired by AlkB with similar efficiencies in both single- and double-stranded
DNA, 1-methyladenine is preferentially repaired in single-stranded DNA. Our
results lay the groundwork for future studies of AlkB and its human homologs
ALKBH2 and ALKBH3.
