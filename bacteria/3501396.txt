We have determined the frequencies and specificities of MHC-reactive and
MHC-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-p) in mitogen
(ConA)-activated splenocytes of normal unprimed mice. The limiting dilution (LD) 
system supported the growth of one out of three Lyt2+ T cell blasts. The
generated CTL-populations lysed blast cell targets specifically as determined by 
split well analyses. MHC-gene product expression was necessary for lysis to
occur, since MHC-negative F9 teratocarcinoma cells were not lysed. The frequency 
determinations and split well analyses revealed: 1) equally high numbers
(approximately 1/100) of CTL-p that generated specific allo-MHC or self-MHC
reactive CTL populations, 2) high frequencies of CTL-p which recognized hapten
(TNP) or minor H (MH)-antigens in the context of self MHC or allo-MHC
determinants. The results are discussed with respect to antigen, restriction and 
receptor specificities of mitogen-activated unprimed T cell blasts.
