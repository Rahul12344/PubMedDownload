BACKGROUND: Support vector machines (SVM) are a powerful tool to analyze data
with a number of predictors approximately equal or larger than the number of
observations. However, originally, application of SVM to analyze biomedical data 
was limited because SVM was not designed to evaluate importance of predictor
variables. Creating predictor models based on only the most relevant variables is
essential in biomedical research. Currently, substantial work has been done to
allow assessment of variable importance in SVM models but this work has focused
on SVM implemented with linear kernels. The power of SVM as a prediction model is
associated with the flexibility generated by use of non-linear kernels. Moreover,
SVM has been extended to model survival outcomes. This paper extends the
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm by proposing three approaches to
rank variables based on non-linear SVM and SVM for survival analysis.
RESULTS: The proposed algorithms allows visualization of each one the RFE
iterations, and hence, identification of the most relevant predictors of the
response variable. Using simulation studies based on time-to-event outcomes and
three real datasets, we evaluate the three methods, based on pseudo-samples and
kernel principal component analysis, and compare them with the original SVM-RFE
algorithm for non-linear kernels. The three algorithms we proposed performed
generally better than the gold standard RFE for non-linear kernels, when
comparing the truly most relevant variables with the variable ranks produced by
each algorithm in simulation studies. Generally, the RFE-pseudo-samples
outperformed the other three methods, even when variables were assumed to be
correlated in all tested scenarios.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approaches can be implemented with accuracy to select
variables and assess direction and strength of associations in analysis of
biomedical data using SVM for categorical or time-to-event responses. Conducting 
variable selection and interpreting direction and strength of associations
between predictors and outcomes with the proposed approaches, particularly with
the RFE-pseudo-samples approach can be implemented with accuracy when analyzing
biomedical data. These approaches, perform better than the classical RFE of Guyon
for realistic scenarios about the structure of biomedical data.
