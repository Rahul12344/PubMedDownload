Cultures of Pseudomonas putida growing in solutions with diphenylmethane as sole 
carbon source formed 1,1,1',1'-tetraphenyldimethyl ether. The product was
identified by gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and infrared and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectrometry. The formation of benzophenone, benzhydrol, and
phenylglycolic acid was established by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. 
Similar techniques also revealed that phenylacetic acid was a major metabolite.
Resting cell suspensions converted benzhydrol to phenyl-glycolic acid and
products tentatively identified as hydroxybenzhydrols and a hydroxybenzophenone. 
Cell suspensions of the bacterium also converted the tetraphenyldimethyl ether to
benzhydrol and benzophenone. Possible pathways for the degradation of these
analogues of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) metabolites are 
discussed.
