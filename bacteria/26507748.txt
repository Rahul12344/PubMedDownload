The increasing number of multidrug resistant bacteria has revitalized interest in
seeking alternative sources for controlling bacterial infection. Silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs), are amongst the most promising candidates due to their
wide microbial spectrum of action. In this work, we report on the safety and
efficacy of the incorporation of collagen coated AgNPs into collagen hydrogels
for tissue engineering. The resulting hybrid materials at [AgNPs] < 0.4 μM
retained the mechanical properties and biocompatibility for primary human skin
fibroblasts and keratinocytes of collagen hydrogels; they also displayed
remarkable anti-infective properties against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli
and P. aeruginosa at considerably lower concentrations than silver nitrate.
Further, subcutaneous implants of materials containing 0.2 μM AgNPs in mice
showed a reduction in the levels of IL-6 and other inflammation markers (CCL24,
sTNFR-2, and TIMP1). Finally, an analysis of silver contents in implanted mice
showed that silver accumulation primarily occurred within the tissue surrounding 
the implant.
