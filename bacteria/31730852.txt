We report a 100-million atom-scale model of an entire cell organelle, a
photosynthetic chromatophore vesicle from a purple bacterium, that reveals the
cascade of energy conversion steps culminating in the generation of ATP from
sunlight. Molecular dynamics simulations of this vesicle elucidate how the
integral membrane complexes influence local curvature to tune photoexcitation of 
pigments. Brownian dynamics of small molecules within the chromatophore probe the
mechanisms of directional charge transport under various pH and salinity
conditions. Reproducing phenotypic properties from atomistic details, a kinetic
model evinces that low-light adaptations of the bacterium emerge as a spontaneous
outcome of optimizing the balance between the chromatophore's structural
integrity and robust energy conversion. Parallels are drawn with the more
universal mitochondrial bioenergetic machinery, from whence molecular-scale
insights into the mechanism of cellular aging are inferred. Together, our
integrative method and spectroscopic experiments pave the way to first-principles
modeling of whole living cells.
