The physiological functions of natural killer (NK) cells in human immunity and
reproduction depend upon diverse interactions between killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and their HLA class I ligands: HLA-A, HLA-B,
and HLA-C. The genomic regions containing the KIR and HLA class I genes are
unlinked, structurally complex, and highly polymorphic. They are also strongly
associated with a wide spectrum of diseases, including infections, autoimmune
disorders, cancers, and pregnancy disorders, as well as the efficacy of
transplantation and other immunotherapies. To facilitate study of these
extraordinary genes, we developed a method that captures, sequences, and analyzes
the 13 KIR genes and HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C from genomic DNA. We also devised a 
bioinformatics pipeline that attributes sequencing reads to specific KIR genes,
determines copy number by read depth, and calls high-resolution genotypes for
each KIR gene. We validated this method by using DNA from well-characterized cell
lines, comparing it to established methods of HLA and KIR genotyping, and
determining KIR genotypes from 1000 Genomes sequence data. This identified 116
previously uncharacterized KIR alleles, which were all demonstrated to be
authentic by sequencing from source DNA via standard methods. Analysis of just
two KIR genes showed that 22% of the 1000 Genomes individuals have a previously
uncharacterized allele or a structural variant. The method we describe is suited 
to the large-scale analyses that are needed for characterizing human populations 
and defining the precise HLA and KIR factors associated with disease. The methods
are applicable to other highly polymorphic genes.
