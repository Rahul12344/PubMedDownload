Contribution and relationship between oxidative phosphorylation and
photophosphorylation pathways in purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) wastewater
treatment under weak light-micro oxygen condition were studied quantitatively.
Results showed that under weak light-anaerobic condition, PNSB followed
photophosphorylation with the first-order degradation kinetic constant k(3) of
0.0585. Under dark-micro aerobic condition, it followed oxidative phosphorylation
with k(2) of 0.0896. Under weak light-micro oxygen condition, both pathways
existed with k(1) of 0.108. When light and oxygen both existed, oxidative
phosphorylation had a strong competitiveness, it played a dominative role and
counted for 92.7% in pollutants degradation, and meanwhile photophosphorylation
was restrained by 81.6%. Theoretical analysis showed the common part from
coenzyme Q (CoQ) to cytochrome c2 (Cyt c2) in both respiration and photosynthetic
chains might cause the competition. When oxygen existed, respiration electron
transport would be enhanced. Other potential explanations included that oxygen
might damage the pigment and membrane system vital to photophosphorylation.
