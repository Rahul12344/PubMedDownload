OBJECTIVE: ] Several key genes (thlA, bcs-operon/crt-bcd1 -etfB2-fixB2-hbd and
adhE) in butanol pathway from Clostridium saccharobutylicum DSM13864 were cloned,
and a butanol-producing Escherichia coli strain was successfully constructed.
METHODS: Using genome of Clostridium saccharobutylicum DSM13864 as template, the 
key genes in butanol synthesis pathway were amplified, the recombinant plasmids
pETDuet-bcs and pRSFDuet-thlA-adhE were constructed. Then the resultant plasmids 
were transformed into E. coli JM109 (DE3) to obtain E. coli BUT1 for butanol
production, under the semi-anaerobic condition. Effects of different mediums on
butanol production were studied.
RESULTS: The recombinant E. coli was capable of producing butanol (25.4 mg/L)
under semi-anaerobic fermentation. After optimization on the fermentation medium,
butanol titer reached 34.1 mg/L.
CONCLUSION: Butanol production by recombinant E. coli harboring exogenous
butanol-producing pathway from Clostridium saccharobutylicum provides a feasible 
solution to overcome the hurdles in traditional butanol production approach by
Clostridia.
