BACKGROUND: TCP-1 is a 60 kD subunit of a cytosolic hetero-oligomeric chaperone
that is known to be involved in the folding of actin and tubulin. This protein is
a member of the chaperonin family, which includes Escherichia coli GroEL, the
mitochondrial heat-shock protein Hsp60, the plastid Rubisco-subunit-binding
protein and the archaebacterial protein TF55. These chaperonins assist the
folding of proteins upon ATP hydrolysis.
RESULTS: Using two-dimensional gel analysis, we have identified nine different
subunits of TCP-1-containing chaperonin complexes from mammalian testis and seven
different subunits of such complexes from mouse F9 cells. We have isolated
full-length mouse cDNAs encoding six novel TCP-1-related polypeptides and show
that these cDNAs encode subunits of the TCP-1-containing cytosolic chaperonin.
These subunits are between 531 and 545 residues in length. Their sequences are
25-36% identical to one another, 27-35% identical to that of TCP-1 and 32-39%
identical to that of the archaebacterial chaperonin, TF55. We have named these
genes, Cctb, Cctg, Cctd, Ccte, Cctz and Ccth, which encode the CCT beta, CCT
gamma, CCT delta, CCT epsilon, CCT zeta and CCT eta subunits, respectively, of
the 'Chaperonin Containing TCP-1' (CCT). All the CCT subunits contain motifs that
are also shared by all other known chaperonins of prokaryotes and eukaryotic
organelles, and that probably relate to their common ATPase function.
CONCLUSION: It is likely that each CCT subunit has a specific, independent
function, as they are highly diverged from each other but conserved from mammals 
to yeast. We suggest that the expansion in the number of types of CCT subunit,
compared with other chaperonins, has allowed CCT to carry out the more complex
functions that are required for the folding and assembly of highly evolved
eukaryotic proteins.
