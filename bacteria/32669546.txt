Neutrophils provide first line of host defense against bacterial infections
utilizing glycolysis for their effector functions. How glycolysis and its major
byproduct lactate are triggered in bone marrow (BM) neutrophils and their
contribution to neutrophil mobilization in acute inflammation is not clear. Here 
we report that bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or Salmonella Typhimurium
triggers lactate release by increasing glycolysis, NADPH-oxidase-mediated
reactive oxygen species and HIF-1Î± levels in BM neutrophils. Increased release of
BM lactate preferentially promotes neutrophil mobilization by reducing
endothelial VE-Cadherin expression, increasing BM vascular permeability via
endothelial lactate-receptor GPR81 signaling. GPR81-/- mice mobilize reduced
levels of neutrophils in response to LPS, unless rescued by VE-Cadherin
disrupting antibodies. Lactate administration also induces release of the BM
neutrophil mobilizers G-CSF, CXCL1 and CXCL2, indicating that this metabolite
drives neutrophil mobilization via multiple pathways. Our study reveals a
metabolic crosstalk between lactate-producing neutrophils and BM endothelium,
which controls neutrophil mobilization under bacterial infection.
