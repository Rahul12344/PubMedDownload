Neutrophil recruitment and activation are thought to play an important role in
tissue damage observed in septicemia. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a small cytokine
with important neutrophil-activating and chemoattractant properties. IL-8 release
was studied after injection of human volunteers with low doses of either
endotoxin (2 ng/kg of body weight) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) (50
micrograms/m2). After TNF-alpha injection, IL-8 appeared at 30 min, whereas
increased levels were first observed after 90 min in endotoxin-challenged
volunteers. Peak levels were measured at 120 min after both endotoxin (192 +/-
193 ng/L) and TNF alpha (500 +/- 236 ng/L) injection. These data indicate that
IL-8 is released in humans after injection of endotoxin and TNF alpha and suggest
that endotoxin-induced IL-8 release is mediated by TNF alpha.
