One of the most abundant immunologic cell types in early decidua is the uterine
natural killer (UNK) cell that despite the presence of cytoplasmic granules rich 
in perforin and granzymes does not degranulate in normal pregnancy. UNK cells are
important producers of angiogenic factors that permit normal dilation of uterine 
arteries to provide increased blood flow for the growing feto-placental unit.
Gram-negative bacteria lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration can trigger an
imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines impairing the
normal immune cells activity as well as uterine homeostasis. The present study
aimed to evaluate by immunohistochemistry the reactivity of perforin and
alpha-actin on UNK cell from LPS-treated pregnant mice. For the first time, we
demonstrate that LPS injection in pregnant mice causes alpha-actin down
regulation, concomitantly with perforin loss in UNK cells. This suggests that LPS
alters UNK cell migration and activates cytotoxic granule release.
