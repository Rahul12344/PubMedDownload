A declining first-phase insulin response (FPIR) is associated with positivity for
multiple islet autoantibodies, irrespective of class II HLA DR-DQ genotype. We
examined the associations of FPIR with genetic variants outside the HLA DR-DQ
region in the Finnish Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) study in
children with and without multiple autoantibodies. Association between FPIR and
class I alleles A*24 and B*39 and eight single nucleotide polymorphisms outside
the HLA region were analyzed in 438 children who had one or more FPIR results
available after seroconversion. Hierarchical linear mixed models were used to
analyze repeated measurements of FPIR. In children with multiple autoantibodies, 
the change in FPIR over time was significantly different between those with
various PTPN2 (rs45450798), FUT2 (rs601338), CTSH (rs3825932), and IKZF4
(rs1701704) genotypes in at least one of the models. In general, children
carrying susceptibility alleles for type 1 diabetes experienced a more rapid
decline in insulin secretion compared with children without susceptibility
alleles. The presence of the class I HLA A*24 allele was also associated with a
steeper decline of FPIR over time in children with multiple autoantibodies.
Certain genetic variants outside the class II HLA region may have a significant
impact on the longitudinal pattern of FPIR.
