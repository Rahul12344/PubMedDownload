Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are abundant in non-lymphoid tissues and
increase following infectious and inflammatory insults. In solid tumors, however,
ILC2s constitute a relatively small proportion of immune cells. Here, we show,
using melanoma as a model, that while the IL-33/IL C2/eosinophil axis suppresses 
tumor growth, tumor-derived lactate attenuates the function and survival of
ILC2s. Melanomas with reduced lactate production (LDHAlow) are growth delayed and
typified by an increased number of ILC2s compared with control tumors. Upon IL-33
stimulation, ILC2s accompanied by eosinophils more effectively restrain the
growth of LDHAlow tumors than control melanomas. Furthermore, database analysis
reveals a negative correlation between the expression of LDHA and markers
associated with ILC2s and the association of high expression of IL33 and an
eosinophil marker SIGLEC8 with better overall survival in human cutaneous
melanoma patients. This work demonstrates that the balance between the
IL-33/ILC2/eosinophil axis and lactate production by tumor cells regulates
melanoma growth.
