The Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family is an evolutionarily conserved group
of cochaperones that modulate numerous cellular processes. Previously we found
that Arabidopsis thaliana BAG6 is required for basal immunity against the fungal 
phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea. However, the mechanisms by which BAG6 controls
immunity are obscure. Here, we address this important question by determining the
molecular mechanisms responsible for BAG6-mediated basal resistance. We show that
Arabidopsis BAG6 is cleaved in vivo in a caspase-1-like-dependent manner and via 
a combination of pull-downs, mass spectrometry, yeast two-hybrid assays, and
chemical genomics, we demonstrate that BAG6 interacts with a C2 GRAM domain
protein (BAGP1) and an aspartyl protease (APCB1), both of which are required for 
BAG6 processing. Furthermore, fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy
established that BAG6 cleavage triggers autophagy in the host that coincides with
disease resistance. Targeted inactivation of BAGP1 or APCB1 results in the
blocking of BAG6 processing and loss of resistance. Mutation of the cleavage site
blocks cleavage and inhibits autophagy in plants; disease resistance is also
compromised. Taken together, these results identify a mechanism that couples an
aspartyl protease with a molecular cochaperone to trigger autophagy and plant
defense, providing a key link between fungal recognition and the induction of
cell death and resistance.
