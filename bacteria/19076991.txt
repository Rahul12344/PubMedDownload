BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Porphyromonas gingivalis secretes gingipains,
endopeptidases essential for the asaccharolytic growth of this bacterium. P.
gingivalis also secretes dipeptidyl aminopeptidases (DPPIV and DPP-7) and a
tripeptidyl aminopeptidase (PTP-A), although their role in asaccharolytic growth 
is unclear. The present study was carried out to elucidate the role of these
dipeptidyl/tripeptidyl aminopeptidases on the asaccharolytic growth of P.
gingivalis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Knockout mutants for the DPPIV (dpp), dpp7 and/or PTP-A
genes were constructed. Brain-heart infusion medium supplemented with sterile
hemin and menadione (BHIHM) was used as a complex medium, and the minimal medium 
used was GA, in which the sole energy source was a mixture of immunoglobulin G
and bovine serum albumin. Growth of P. gingivalis was monitored by measuring the 
optical density of the culture.
RESULTS: All knockout mutants for DPPIV, dpp7 and PTP-A grew as well as strain
W83 in BHIHM. In GA, growth of single-knockout and double-knockout mutants was
similar to that of W83, whereas growth of a triple-knockout mutant (83-47A) was
reduced. We purified recombinant DPPIV and recombinant PTP-A from recombinant
Escherichia coli overproducers, and purified DPP-7 from the triple-knockout
mutant 83-4A. GA supplemented with the three purified dipeptidyl/tripeptidyl
aminopeptidases supported the growth of 83-47A.
CONCLUSION: DPPIV, DPP-7 and PTP-A contribute to the normal growth of P.
gingivalis by cleaving substrate peptides into short-chain polypeptides that are 
efficient energy sources for P. gingivalis.
