In this article, we characterize a novel Ag for invariant NKT (iNKT) cells
capable of producing an especially robust Th1 response. This glycosphingolipid,
DB06-1, is similar in chemical structure to the well-studied α-galactosylceramide
(αGalCer), with the only change being a single atom: the substitution of a
carbonyl oxygen with a sulfur atom. Although DB06-1 is not a more effective Ag in
vitro, the small chemical change has a marked impact on the ability of this lipid
Ag to stimulate iNKT cells in vivo, with increased IFN-γ production at 24 h
compared with αGalCer, increased IL-12, and increased activation of NK cells to
produce IFN-γ. These changes are correlated with an enhanced ability of DB06-1 to
load in the CD1d molecules expressed by dendritic cells in vivo. Moreover,
structural studies suggest a tighter fit into the CD1d binding groove by DB06-1
compared with αGalCer. Surprisingly, when iNKT cells previously exposed to DB06-1
are restimulated weeks later, they have greatly increased IL-10 production.
Therefore, our data are consistent with a model whereby augmented and or
prolonged presentation of a glycolipid Ag leads to increased activation of NK
cells and a Th1-skewed immune response, which may result, in part, from enhanced 
loading into CD1d. Furthermore, our data suggest that strong antigenic
stimulation in vivo may lead to the expansion of IL-10-producing iNKT cells,
which could counteract the benefits of increased early IFN-γ production.
