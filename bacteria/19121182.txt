BACKGROUND: Routine bacterial monitoring of apheresis platelet concentrates (APC)
and pooled platelet concentrates (PPC) was introduced in two German blood
services using culture and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR). The results of testing are reviewed and used to discuss different
strategies for detection of bacterial contamination of PCs.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two thousand three hundred and sixty-two APCs and 1993 
PPCs have been tested by real-time RT-PCR and the BacT/Alert automated culturing 
system using aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles. After standard processing of 
PCs and storage of 22-24 h at 20-24 degrees C with agitation, samples were taken 
under aseptic conditions. Reactive culture bottles were confirmed as positive and
bacterial isolates were identified by 16S rRNA analysis and biochemical tests.
RESULTS: Seventeen of 2362 tested APCs were reactive in culture and one also in
RT-PCR. Of these, 13 APCs were identified as initially positive as Staphylococcus
warneri (n = 1, positive in aerobic and anaerobic culture), Propionibacterium
acnes (n = 12, positive only in anaerobic culture) and four were initially
reactive. Two of 1993 PPCs were initially reactive (anaerobic) and two more were 
confirmed positive (anaerobic) from a repeat culture and identified as P. acnes. 
All remaining specimens were tested negative.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that the predominant organisms implicated in
platelet bacterial contamination are part of the human skin flora. Inoculating
blood culture systems and anaerobic cultivation detects these bacteria after
approximately 3-7 days when blood products have been transfused. Based on the
presented data different screening strategies are discussed.
