Endosomal recycling pathways regulate cellular homeostasis via the transport of
internalized material back to the plasma membrane. Phox homology (PX) and band
4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain-containing proteins are a recently
identified subfamily of PX proteins that are critical for the recycling of
numerous transmembrane cargo molecules. The PX-FERM subfamily includes three
endosome-associated proteins called sorting nexin (SNX) 17, SNX27, and SNX31.
These are modular peripheral membrane proteins that act as central scaffolds
mediating protein-lipid interactions, cargo binding, and regulatory protein
recruitment. This chapter outlines the methodology employed to classify the
PX-FERM family using combined bioinformatics and structure prediction tools. It
further details the application of isothermal titration calorimetry and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy to understand the mechanisms that underpin their 
endosomal membrane recruitment and subsequent recognition of NPxY/NxxY peptide
sorting motifs, present in many cargo receptors and required for their
trafficking. It is now increasingly recognized that the formation of a stable
trafficking complex is dictated by a multitude of coordinated protein-protein and
protein-lipid interactions, and the approaches highlighted here will be useful
for future studies aimed at understanding these biomolecular interactions in
greater detail.
