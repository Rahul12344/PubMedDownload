CD8+ T cell expansions and functions rely on glycolysis, but the mechanisms
underlying CD8+ T cell glycolytic metabolism remain elusive. Here, we show that
acylglycerol kinase (AGK) is required for the establishment and maintenance of
CD8+ T cell metabolic and functional fitness. AGK deficiency dampens CD8+ T cell 
antitumor functions in vivo and perturbs CD8+ T cell proliferation in vitro.
Activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, which mediates elevated CD8+ T cell glycolysis, is
tightly dependent on AGK kinase activity. Mechanistically, T cell antigen
receptor (TCR)- and CD28-stimulated recruitment of PTEN to the plasma membrane
facilitates AGK-PTEN interaction and AGK-triggered PTEN phosphorylation, thereby 
restricting PTEN phosphatase activity in CD8+ T cells. Collectively, these
results demonstrate that AGK maintains CD8+ T cell metabolic and functional state
by restraining PTEN activity and highlight a critical role for AGK in CD8+ T cell
metabolic programming and effector function.
