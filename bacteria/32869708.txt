BACKGROUND: Immune cell dysfunction is listed among complications resulting from 
chronic kidney disease (CKD). It could be associated with T-cells, which play a
role in the lymphocytic migration and infiltration. However, the data on
chemokine receptors expression on T-cells in patients with CKD particularly
treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) are still limited.
METHODS: The study aimed at multiparameter flow-cytometric analysis of the
absolute numbers and percentage of T-cell subsets with surface chemokine
receptors (CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CXCR3, and CXCR4) or receptors' combinations in 47
children treated with PD.
RESULTS: We found lower absolute numbers of total T lymphocytes, lymphocytes with
surface CCR5, CXCR4+CCR5, CXCR3+CCR5 antigens and T-cells with CCR4, CCR4+CD4,
CXCR3, CXCR3+CD4, and CD8 receptors. Lymphocytes T with CD4, CCR7, CD28+CCR7,
CXCR3+CD8 antigens showed higher percentage in children on PD as compared to
healthy children and opposite percentage values of CCR4+, CCR4+CD4+, CXCR3+ T
lymphocytes were diminished. Mean fluorescent intensity for CCR7+, CCR7+CD45RO+, 
CCR7+CD28+, CXCR4+CD4+, CCR5+CD4+, CCR4+, CCR4+CD4+ T-cells was lower in the PD
group than in healthy children. The analysis of correlation between T lymphocyte 
subpopulations with chemokine receptors and other parameters revealed positive
correlation of CCR7+ and CCR7+CD28+ T-cells and weekly creatinine clearance,
negative correlation between the percentage of CD45RO+CCR7 antigen positive
T-cells and KT/Vurea.
SUMMARY: In conclusion, we could not confirm the phenomenon of earlier senescence
of T-cells in children with CKD on PD treatment. This still requires further
investigation. The higher percentage of T-cells with CCR7 surface receptor could 
be responsible for the increase of proliferation activity in this group of
children.
