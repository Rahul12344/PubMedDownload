The Gram-positive spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis causes anthrax by
secreting anthrax toxin, which consists of protective antigen (PA), lethal factor
and oedema factor. Binding of PA to receptors triggers the multi-step process of 
anthrax toxin entry into target cells. Two distinct cellular receptors, ANTXR1
(also known as tumour endothelial marker 8; TEM8) and ANTXR2 (also known as
capillary morphogenesis protein 2; CMG2), for anthrax toxin have been identified.
Although the crystal structure of the extracellular von Willebrand factor A (vWA)
domain of CMG2 has been reported, the difference between the vWA domains of TEM8 
and CMG2 remains unclear because there are no structural data for the TEM8 vWA
domain. In this report, the TEM8 vWA domain was expressed, purified and
crystallized. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.8 Å resolution from a
single crystal, which belonged to space group P1 with unit-cell parameters
a=65.9, b=66.1, c=74.4 Å, α=63.7, β=88.2, γ=59.9°.
