Fifty-nine Escherichia coli strains belonging to two clonal groupings were
investigated for major outer membrane proteins, colicin production, and partly
for plasmid DNA content. The membrane protein patterns of the 01:K1:H7(H-):F11
and O1:K1:H-:F9 strains obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis were distinctly different from each other and, therefore, are
useful for clonal assignment. All of the F11 isolates had one plasmid of about 85
Md in common which is suggested to be characteristic for the clone. Their content
of smaller plasmid DNA was heterogeneous and showed geographical differences. The
F9 strains showed a plasmid pattern different from the F11 strains. A plasmid of 
2.6 Md was found in all of these isolates. Colicin production was found to be
useful for clonal assignment only in two thirds of the F9 and not in the F11
strains. Some strains with identical properties seem to be of epidemic
importance.
