Myocardin-related transcription factor-A (MRTF-A) is a Rho signal-responsive
transcriptional coactivator of serum response factor (SRF). Recent studies
indicated that MRTF-A might be an important regulator of mammary gland and be
involved in cancer metastasis. However, the roles of histone modification in the 
MRTF-A-dependent signal pathway and tumor migration are still not very clear.
Here, we report that histone methylation is required for the MRTF-A-mediated
upregulation of myosin regulatory light chain 9 (MYL9), an important cytoskeletal
component which is implicated in cell migration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
SET and MYND domain containing protein 3 (SMYD3), a hitone methyltransferase
(HMT) associated with carcinogenesis, might be the one which is responsible for
the histone methylation occurred in the MRTF-A-mediated- transactivation of MYL9 
and migration of breast cancer cells. Overexpression of SMYD3 promotes
MRTF-A-mediated upregulation of MYL9 and migration of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, 
while contrary results were observed when the endogenous MRTF-A and SMYD3 were
suppressed with specific siRNAs. In addition, the mutation analysis suggested
that this cooperative transactivation is mainly mediated via the proximal binding
element of MRTF-A in the promoter of MYL9, and the HMT activity of SMYD3 is
required as well. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which MRTF-A and SMYD3
functions in transcriptional regulation and cell migration, and provide a better 
understanding for metastasis of breast cancer.
