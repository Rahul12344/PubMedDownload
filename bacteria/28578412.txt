Binary enterotoxins Clostridium (C.) botulinum C2 toxin, C. perfringens iota
toxin and C. difficile toxin CDT are composed of a transport (B) and a separate
non-linked enzyme (A) component. Their B-components mediate endocytic uptake into
mammalian cells and subsequently transport of the A-components from acidic
endosomes into the cytosol, where the latter ADP-ribosylate G-actin resulting in 
cell rounding and cell death causing clinical symptoms. Protein folding enzymes, 
including Hsp90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases facilitate transport of 
the A-components across endosomal membranes. Here, we identified Hsp70 as a novel
host cell factor specifically interacting with A-components of C2, iota and CDT
toxins to facilitate their transport into the cell cytosol. Pharmacological
Hsp70-inhibition specifically prevented pH-dependent trans-membrane transport of 
A-components into the cytosol thereby protecting living cells and stem
cell-derived human miniguts from intoxication. Thus, Hsp70-inhibition might lead 
to development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat diseases associated with 
bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins.
