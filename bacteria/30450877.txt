Self-biting disease occurs in most farmed fur animals in the world. The mechanism
and rapid detection method of this disease has not been reported. We applied
bulked sergeant analysis (BSA) in combination with RAPD method to analyze a
molecular genetic marker linked with self-biting trait in mink group. The
molecular marker was converted into SCAR and loop-mediated isothermal
amplification (LAMP) marker for rapid detection of this disease. A single RAPD
marker A10 amplified a specific band of 1000bp in self-biting minks. The
sequences of the bands exhibited 73% similarity to the Canis Brucella. SCAR and
LAMP marker were designed for the specific fragment of RAPD marker A10 and
validated in 30 self-biting minks and 30 healthy minks. c2 test showed difference
(p0.05) with SCAR and significant difference (p0.01) with LAMP in the detection
rate between the two groups, but LAMP method was more accurate than SCAR method. 
This indicated that LAMP can be used as a positive marker to detect self-biting
disease in minks.
