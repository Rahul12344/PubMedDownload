DNA Damage Tolerance (DDT) mechanisms help dealing with unrepaired DNA lesions
that block replication and challenge genome integrity. Previous in vitro studies 
showed that the bacterial replicase is able to re-prime downstream of a DNA
lesion, leaving behind a single-stranded DNA gap. The question remains of what
happens to this gap in vivo. Following the insertion of a single lesion in the
chromosome of a living cell, we showed that this gap is mostly filled in by
Homology Directed Gap Repair in a RecA dependent manner. When cells fail to
repair this gap, or when homologous recombination is impaired, cells are still
able to divide, leading to the loss of the damaged chromatid, suggesting that
bacteria lack a stringent cell division checkpoint mechanism. Hence, at the
expense of losing one chromatid, cell survival and proliferation are ensured.
