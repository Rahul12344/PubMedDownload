BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection is usually acquired in childhood and
persists into adulthood if untreated. The bacterium induces a chronic
inflammatory response, which is associated with epigenetic alterations in
oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, cell-cycle regulators, and cell-adhesion
molecules.
AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of H. pylori infection on
the methylation status of Thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), Hypermethylated in cancer 1
(HIC1) and Gata binding protein-4 (GATA-4) in gastric biopsy samples from
children and adults infected or uninfected with the bacterium and in samples
obtained from gastric cancer patients.
METHODS: The methylation pattern was analyzed with methylation-specific PCR.
RESULTS: Our results showed that H. pylori infection was associated with
methylation of the promoter regions of the THBS1 and GATA-4 genes in pediatric
and adult samples (p < 0.01). HIC1 showed the lowest level of methylation, which 
was not an early event during gastric carcinogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study indicate that methylation of THBS1 and
GATA-4 occurs in the early stages of chronic gastritis and gastric cancer in
association with H. pylori infection; however, in gastric cancer samples, other
mechanisms cooperate with the down-regulation of these genes. Methylation of HIC1
may not be the principal mechanism implicated in its down-regulation in gastric
cancer samples.
