In order to construct prokaryotic expression system of MHC classI chain-related
gene A (mica) and purify MICA protein, RNAs were extracted from the peripheral
blood samples and mica cDNA fragments were obtained by RT-PCR method. The cDNA
for mica was ligated with cloning vector by TOPO method. The recombinant cloning 
vector and prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a were digested by two restriction
enzymes and ligated to construct pET-28a-MICA recombinant expression vector, then
the pET-28a-MICA vector was transformed and expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3. The
recombinant protein was purified by Ni-NTA Spin method. The results showed that
the recombinant MICA protein expressed with soluble form in host with
pET-28a-MICA vector after IPTG induction. The recombinant target protein was
obtained by Ni-NTA spin purification. In conclusion, this study has constructed
prokaryotic expression system of mica gene and has purified MICA protein which
would help to explore the interaction between MICA and transplantation
immunology.
