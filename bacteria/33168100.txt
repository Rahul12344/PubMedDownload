The Companion Vector-Borne Diseases (CVBD) World Forum is a working group of
leading international experts who meet annually to evaluate current scientific
findings and future trends concerning the distribution, pathogenesis, clinical
presentation, diagnosis and prevention of vector-borne infections of dogs and
cats. At the 14th Symposium of the CVBD World Forum in Trieste, Italy (March
25-28, 2019), we identified the need to (i) bring attention to the potential
spread of parasites and vectors with relocated dogs, and (ii) provide advice to
the veterinary profession regarding the importance of surveillance and treatment 
for parasites and vector-borne infections when rehoming dogs. This letter shares 
a consensus statement from the CVBD World Forum as well as a summary of the
problem faced, including the role of veterinary professionals in parasite
surveillance, causal issues, and the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation 
in addressing the problem. To limit opportunities for dissemination of parasites 
and vectors, whenever possible, underlying problems creating the need for dog
rehoming should be addressed. However, when it is necessary to rehome dogs, this 
should ideally take place in the country and national region of origin. When
geographically distant relocation occurs, veterinary professionals have a vital
role to play in public education, vigilance for detection of exotic vectors and
infections, and alerting the medical community to the risk(s) for pathogen
spread. With appropriate veterinary intervention, dog welfare needs can be met
without inadvertently allowing global spread of parasites and their vectors.
