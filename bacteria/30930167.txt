Cell polarization is important for various biological processes. However, its
regulation, particularly initiation, is incompletely understood. Here, we
investigated mechanisms by which neutrophils break their symmetry and initiate
their cytoskeleton polarization from an apolar state in circulation for their
extravasation during inflammation. We show here that a local increase in plasma
membrane (PM) curvature resulting from cell contact to a surface triggers the
initial breakage of the symmetry of an apolar neutrophil and is required for
subsequent polarization events induced by chemical stimulation. This local
increase in PM curvature recruits SRGAP2 via its F-BAR domain, which in turn
activates PI4KA and results in PM PtdIns4P polarization. Polarized PM PtdIns4P is
targeted by RPH3A, which directs PIP5K1C90 and subsequent phosphorylated myosin
light chain polarization, and this polarization signaling axis regulates
neutrophil firm attachment to endothelium. Thus, this study reveals a mechanism
for the initiation of cell cytoskeleton polarization.
