In severe infection and sepsis, activation of coagulation frequently occurs,
which contributes to the development of multiple organ dysfunction. Factor V
Leiden is a relatively common mutation resulting in a mild prohemostatic state
and consequently with an increased tendency to develop thrombosis.
Hypothetically, patients with factor V Leiden may suffer from more severe
coagulopathy in cases of severe infection or sepsis. Aggravation of the
procoagulant state in sepsis may subsequently result in more severe organ
dysfunction and an increased risk of death. In this article we review the
experimental and clinical evidence regarding the relationship between the
presence of a factor V Leiden mutation and the incidence and outcome of sepsis.
