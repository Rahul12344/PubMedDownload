The adaptor protein TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF) 3 is required for
effective TCR signaling and normal T cell effector functions, and associates with
the CD3/CD28 complex upon activation. To determine how TRAF3 promotes proximal
TCR signaling, we studied TRAF3-deficient mouse and human T cells, which showed a
marked reduction in activating phosphorylation of the TCR-associated kinase Lck. 
The impact of TRAF3 on this very early signaling event led to the hypothesis that
TRAF3 restrains one or both of two known inhibitors of Lck, C-terminal Src kinase
(Csk) and protein tyrosine phosphatase N22 (PTPN22). TRAF3 associated with Csk,
promoting the dissociation of Csk from the plasma membrane. TRAF3 also associated
with and regulated the TCR/CD28 induced localization of PTPN22. Loss of TRAF3
resulted in increased amounts of both Csk and PTPN22 in T cell membrane fractions
and decreased association of PTPN22 with Csk. These findings identify a new role 
for T cell TRAF3 in promoting T cell activation, by regulating localization and
functions of early TCR signaling inhibitors.
