Widely distributed among prokaryotes, short chain fatty acid kinases provide a
path for fatty acid entry into central metabolic pathways. These enzymes catalyze
the reversible, ATP-dependent synthesis of acyl-phosphates, which leads to the
production of acyl-CoA derivatives by a coordinate acyltransferase. To date,
characterized representatives of short chain fatty acid kinases exhibit
relatively narrow substrate specificity. In this work, biochemical
characterization of a predicted acetate kinase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides
reveals a novel enzyme with broad substrate specificity for primary fatty acids
of varying lengths (C2--C8).
