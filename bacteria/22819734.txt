Production of green chemicals and fuels using metabolically engineered organisms 
has been a promising alternative to petroleum-based production. Higher chain
alcohols (C4-C8) are of interest because they can be used as chemical feedstock
as well as fuels. Recently, the feasibility of n-hexanol synthesis using
Escherichia coli has been demonstrated by extending the modified Clostridium
CoA-dependent n-butanol synthesis pathway, thereby elongating carbon chain length
via reactions in reversed β-oxidation, (or β-reduction). Here, we developed an
anaerobic growth selection platform that allows selection or enrichment of
enzymes for increased synthesis of C6 and C8 linear alcohols. Using this
selection, we were able to improve the carbon flux towards the synthesis of C6
and C8 acyl-CoA intermediates. Replacement of the original enzyme Clostridium
acetobutylicum Hbd with Ralstonia eutropha homologue PaaH1 increased production
of n-hexanol by 10-fold. Further directed evolution by random mutagenesis of
PaaH1 improved n-hexanol and n-octanol production. This anaerobic growth
selection platform may be useful for selecting enzymes for production of
long-chain alcohols and acids using this CoA-dependent pathway.
