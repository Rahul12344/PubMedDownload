BACKGROUND: Our objective was to assess the impact of screening and identifying
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) carriers as a single measure
in 4 intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS: An evaluative study including two 6-month periods was conducted
prospectively. The evaluation concerned the hand hygiene compliance (HHC) for
contacts with MRSA carriers versus contacts with noncarriers (comparison C1, main
objective) and for a period of absence of identification (P1) versus a period of 
identification (P2) (comparison C2) and MRSA cross transmission (P1 vs P2)
(comparison C3) measured with 2 indicators.
RESULTS: Overall, 1326 opportunities of hand hygiene were observed. Concerning
C1, the HHC for contacts with MRSA carriers was 42.5% versus 43.1% for contacts
with noncarriers (not significant). This absence of difference was recorded
whatever the ICU specialty, the category of personnel, and the nature of
contacts. Concerning C2, the HHC in P1 was 44.8% versus 48.5% in P2 (not
significant). Concerning C3, no significant difference was identified between the
2 periods.
CONCLUSION: We did not identify any advantage by using screening and identifying 
MRSA carriers in those 4 ICUs in which no specific strategy of additional contact
measures was implemented for MRSA carriers.
