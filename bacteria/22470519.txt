BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis PT4 KS8822/88 replicates
rapidly in HLA-B27-transfected human monocytic U937 cells. In this process,
Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) genes play a crucial role. Our previous
study indicated that 118 Salmonella genes, including 8 SPI-2 genes were affected 
by HLA-B27 antigen during Salmonella infection of U937 cells.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To further investigate Salmonella replication in
HLA-B27-positive U937 monocytic cells, two SPI-2 genes, ssaS and sscA
up-regulated most during Salmonella infection of HLA-B27-transfected U937 cells, 
were mutated by using one-step gene disruption method. Intracellular survival and
replication of the mutants in the U937 cells was compared to that of the wild
type strain. Surprisingly, the two mutated strains replicated significantly more 
than the wild type bacteria in HLA-B27-transfected cells. Secretion of tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) was significantly
induced during the infection of HLA-B27-transfected U937 cells with the mutants. 
The results indicated that the certain SPI-2 genes in wild type bacteria suppress
Salmonella intracellular growth and production of cytokines in infected
HLA-B27-transfected cells. HLA-B27-associated modulation of Salmonella SPI-2
genes and cytokine production may have importance in the persistent infection of 
the bacteria and the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides evidence that certain virulence factors of
pathogens can reduce the intracellular growth in the host cells. We suggest that 
the limiting intracellular growth might be a strategy for persistence of bacteria
in host cells, keeping a balance between pathogenic growth and pathogenesis.
