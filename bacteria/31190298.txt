PURPOSE: In Europe, intravenous fosfomycin (IV) is used particularly in
difficult-to-treat or complex infections, caused by both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains. Here, we
investigated the efficacy and safety of intravenous fosfomycin under real-life
conditions.
METHODS: Prospective, multi-center, and non-interventional study in patients with
bacterial infections from 20 intensive care units (ICU) in Germany and Austria
(NCT01173575).
RESULTS: Overall, 209 patients were included (77 females, 132 males, mean age:
59 ± 16 years), 194 of which were treated in intensive care (APACHE II score at
the beginning of fosfomycin therapy: 23 ± 8). Main indications (± bacteremia or
sepsis) were infections of the CNS (21.5%), community- (CAP) and
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP, 15.3%),
bone and joint infections (BJI, 11%), abdominal infections (11%), and bacteremia 
(10.5%). Most frequently identified pathogens were S. aureus (22.3%), S.
epidermidis (14.2%), Enterococcus spp. (10.8%), E. coli (12.3%) and Klebsiella
spp. (7.7%). At least one multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogen was isolated from 51
patients (24.4%). Fosfomycin was administered with an average daily dose of
13.7 ± 3.5 g over 12.4 ± 8.6 days, almost exclusively (99%) in combination with
other antibiotics. The overall clinical success was favorable in 81.3% (148/182) 
of cases, and in 84.8% (39/46) of patients with ≥ 1 MDR pathogen. Noteworthy,
16.3% (34/209) of patients developed at least one, in the majority of cases
non-serious, adverse drug reaction during fosfomycin therapy.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that IV fosfomycin is an effective and safe
combination partner for the treatment of a broad spectrum of severe bacterial
infections in critically ill patients.
