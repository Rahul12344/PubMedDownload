The London Cord Blood Bank was established with the aim of collecting, processing
and storing 10000 unrelated stem cell donations for the significant number of
children in the UK requiring transplantation, for whom a matched unrelated bone
marrow donor cannot be found. Collection is performed at two hospitals by
dedicated cord blood bank staff after delivery of the placenta. Mothers are
interviewed regarding medical, ethnic and behavioural history by nurse
counsellors and sign a detailed consent form. Donations are returned to the bank 
for processing. Volume reduction is undertaken by a simple, closed,
semi-automated blood processing system, with excellent recovery of progenitor
cells. Units are cryopreserved and stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen.
Blood samples from mothers and cord blood donations are tested for the UK
mandatory red cell and microbiology markers for blood donors. Donations are typed
for HLA-A, B and DR at medium resolution (antigen split) level using
sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing and sequence-specific priming
techniques. The selection of collection hospitals on the basis of ethnic mix has 
proven effective, with 41.5% of donations derived from non-European caucasoid
donors. Bacterial contamination of collections has been dramatically reduced by
implementation of improved umbilical cord decontamination protocols.
