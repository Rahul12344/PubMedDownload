BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Toll-like-receptors (TLRs) are important for the recognition of the
causative agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Negative regulation of TLRs is
necessary to control deleterious inflammatory damage, but could provide a means
of immune evasion by M. tuberculosis as well.
METHODS: To obtain insight in the extent of expression of inhibitory regulators
of immunity in patients with active TB, peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells
(PBMCs) and plasma were obtained from 54 TB patients and 29 healthy blood donors 
from Chittagong, Bangladesh. Bilateral alveolar macrophages were obtained from an
infected versus a contralateral normal lung segment of 9 patients. Statistical
analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon matched pairs testing. 
Correlations were calculated using the Spearman rho test.
RESULTS: PBMCs harvested from TB patients demonstrated increased mRNA expression 
of IL-1-receptor-associated-kinase-M, suppressor-of-cytokine-signalling-3 and
Toll-interacting-protein. Flow cytometry revealed enhanced expression of
IL-1-receptor-like-1 (ST2) on lymphocytes. Plasma soluble ST2 was elevated in
patients with TB and correlated with established TB biomarkers, most strongly
with soluble interleukin-2 receptor subunit Î± and interleukin-8. Alveolar
macrophage mRNA expression of negative TLR regulators did not differ between the 
infected and contralateral lung side.
CONCLUSION: These results show enhanced expression of distinct negative
regulators of innate immunity in PBMCs of patients with TB and identify plasma
soluble ST2 as a potential novel biomarker for TB disease activity.
