Argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is an important enzyme in arginine synthesis and
the urea cycle, which are highly conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes. The gene 
encoding Streptococcus mutans ASL (smASL) was amplified and cloned into
expression vector pET28a. The recombinant smASL protein was expressed in a
soluble form in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified to homogeneity by
two-step column chromatography. Crystals suitable for X-ray analysis were
obtained and X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The 
crystals belonged to space group R3, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 254.5,
c = 78.3 Å.
