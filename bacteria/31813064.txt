Members of the genus Methylobacter (Mtb) have been identified to be the most
dominant methanotrophs in aquatic as well as terrestrial habitats. Methylobacter 
shows four species with validly published names and these are grouped in two
clades based on phylogenetic and genomic comparisons. Mtb luteus and Mtb marinus 
(synonym: Mtb whittenburyi) belong to clade 1 Methylobacter. Clade 2
Methylobacter comprises of two species: Mtb tundripaludum and Mtb psychrophilus
(type strain, no longer available). We isolated a yellow pigmented, rod-shaped
methanotroph, strain (KRF1), from a tropical rice field in India, which might
represent a putative novel species within Methylobacter clade 2. The cells are
long, thick and motile rods. The strain grows under variable oxygen concentration
(5-80% air) and also in nitrogen free media (5-50% air). The morphological,
chemotaxonomic and genomic features of KRF1 were investigated in details. The
digital DNA-DNA hybridization values and average nucleotide identity (ANI)
comparisons with the members of its closest species, Mtb tundripaludum, were in
the range of 20-26% and ~ 73-81%, respectively. The fatty acid methyl esters
profile of KRF1 was different from the profile of Mtb tundripaludum SV96T. The
major cell wall fatty acids of strain KRF1 are 16:1 ω7c/16:1 ω6c summed feature
(55.4%) and 16:1 ω5c (28.6%). The draft genome of KRF1 is of 5.04 Mbp in size
with a GC content of 49.3% and the whole genome shotgun sequencing project has
the accession number RYFG00000000 (version: RYFG02000000). Due to the
difficulties in the maintenance and cryopreservation of this culture, it could
not be deposited in two international culture collections. We thereby propose
KRF1 to be member of a Candidatus species, 'Candidatus Methylobacter oryzae'
KRF1. The culture is maintained live in our laboratory and also in our
institutional WDCM approved culture collection (MACS Collection of
Microorganisms) as MCMB-1471.
