OBJECTIVES: To clarify the characteristics and growth of bacteria that may
infiltrate liquid baby formula during feeding and after storage for more than 3
h, the transfer of oral bacteria through artificial nipples, and bacterial
survival in liquid baby formula and a baby drink were examined immediately after 
drinking and after storage at 4°C for 12 h and 24 h.
METHODS: Thirteen human subjects (aged 19-24 years) were asked to drink
approximately 50 mL of liquid baby formula and a baby drink, via the artificial
nipple of a baby bottle. Samples of the remaining liquid after storage at 4°C for
12 h and 24 h were inoculated onto blood agar plates and incubated anaerobically 
at 37°C for 7 days. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual colonies, and the
bacterial species were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: The mean concentrations of bacteria in the liquid baby formula were
(2.6±2.8) × 104 and (4.1±6.6) × 104 colony-forming unit/mL after storage at 4°C
for 12 h and 24 h, respectively. Streptococcus (43.2%), Veillonella (9.3%), and
Schaalia (8.2%) species were recovered from the remaining liquid baby formula
after storage at 4°C for 12 h. In contrast, no bacteria were detected in the
remaining baby drink after storage at 37°C for 24 h.
CONCLUSIONS: The levels of bacteria immediately after drinking and after storage 
at 4°C for 12 h or 24 h were similar, suggesting that remaining liquid baby
formula may be preserved safely in a refrigerator for more than 3 h.
