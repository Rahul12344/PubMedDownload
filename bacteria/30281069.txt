BACKGROUND: Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has declined significantly since 
the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). It is not known
whether certain infant populations remain at higher risk of IPD in countries with
established 13-valent PCV (PCV13) programs. We aimed to describe the
epidemiology, clinical characteristics, serotype distribution, and outcomes of
IPD in infants, and to estimate the relative risk of PCV13-type, non-PCV13-type, 
and overall IPD in premature infants compared to term infants during a 4-year
period after the PCV13 program was established.
METHODS: This was a prospective, enhanced national surveillance of
laboratory-confirmed IPD in England in infants aged <1 year diagnosed during
2013-2016.
RESULTS: There were 517 cases of IPD (incidence: 19/100000 infants). Incidence
was significantly higher in premature infants compared with those born at term
(49/100000 vs 17/100000; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.87; P < .001), with
infants born before 28 weeks' gestation having the highest incidence (150/100000;
IRR, 8.8; P < .001). Of the 454 IPD cases with serotyped isolates, most were
caused by non-PCV13 serotypes (369 cases, 71.4%), with 85 cases (16.4%) due to
PCV13 serotypes. There were 31 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR], 6.2% [95%
confidence interval, 4.3%-8.6%]). Premature infants did not have a higher CFR
than term infants (P = .62).
CONCLUSIONS: IPD incidence in infants remains lower than rates reported prior to 
PCV7 introduction in England. The risk of IPD remains significantly higher in
premature infants compared to infants born at term, for both PCV13 and non-PCV13 
serotypes. Any changes to the infant PCV13 immunization schedule may
disproportionally affect premature infants.
