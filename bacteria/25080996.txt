Identifying gene mutations in individual tumors is critical to improve the
efficacy of cancer therapy by matching targeted drugs to specific mutations.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are stromal or mesenchymal subepithelial
neoplasms affecting the gastrointestinal tract and frequently contain activating 
gene mutations in either KIT or platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGFRA).
Although GIST is highly responsive to several selective tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, combined use of inhibitors targeting other mutations is needed to
further prolong survival in patients with GIST. In this study, we aim to screen
and identify genetic mutations in GIST for targeted therapy using the new Ion
Torrent next-generation sequencing platform. Utilizing the Ion Ampliseq Cancer
Panel, we sequenced 737 loci from 45 cancer-related genes using DNA extracted
from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of 121 human
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, set up stringent parameters for reliable variant
calling by filtering out potential raw base calling errors, and identified
frequent mutations in the KIT gene. This study demonstrates the utility of using 
Ion Torrent sequencing to efficiently identify human cancer mutations. This may
provide a molecular basis for clinically developing new drugs targeting these
gene mutations for GIST therapy.
