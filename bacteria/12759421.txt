Memory T cells are more responsive to Ag than naive cells. To determine whether
memory T cells also have more efficient TCR signaling, we compared naive,
effector, and memory CD8 T cells of the same antigenic specificity. Surprisingly,
initial CD3 signaling events are indistinguishable. However, memory T cells have 
more extensive lipid rafts with higher phosphoprotein content before TCR
engagement. Upon activation in vivo, they more efficiently induce phosphorylation
of-LAT (linker for activation of T cells), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38. Thus, memory CD8 T cells do not 
increase their TCR sensitivity, but are better poised to augment downstream
signals. We propose that this regulatory mechanism might increase signal
transduction in memory T cells, while limiting TCR cross-reactivity and
autoimmunity.
