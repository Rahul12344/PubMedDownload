The block in the CD80/CD86-CD28/CTLA-4 pathway in CTLA4-H gamma 1 transgenic (Tg)
mice results in strongly impaired systemic IgG immunity and failure to develop
germinal center reactions. By contrast, here we report that mucosal immunity and 
IgA B cell differentiation are not affected by this block. We found abundant
germinal centers and evidence of IgA switch differentiation in Peyer's patches,
normal total IgA levels, and normal numbers of IgA-labeling cells in the gut
mucosa. The distribution of B-1 and B-2 cells and the relative contribution of
B-1 cells to the total IgA B cells were similar in Tg and wild-type mice. Despite
this, oral immunizations with keyhole limpet hemocyanin plus cholera toxin
adjuvant failed to stimulate Ag-specific mucosal IgA responses in CTLA4-H gamma 1
Tg mice. This was not due to a lack of adjuvant activity of cholera toxin in Tg
mice, nor was this secondary to an inability to take up Ag from the gut lumen.
Rather, CD4+ T cells stimulated by oral immunization in Tg mice appeared to be
inappropriately primed, as evidenced by a significantly reduced level of CD40
ligand and CD44 expression and an increased expression of CD95 compared to those 
in wild-type mice. This study reveals a paradox in the regulation of mucosal IgA 
responses.
