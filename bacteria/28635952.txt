Yunis-Varón syndrome (YVS) is an autosomal recessive disorder comprising skeletal
anomalies, dysmorphism, global developmental delay and intracytoplasmic
vacuolation in brain and other tissues. All hitherto-reported pathogenic variants
affect FIG4, a lipid phosphatase involved in phosphatidylinositol
(3,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(3,5)P2] metabolism. FIG4 interacts with PIKfyve, a
lipid kinase, via the adapter protein VAC14; all subunits of the resulting
complex are essential for PtdIns(3,5)P2 synthesis in the endolysosomal membrane
compartment. Here, we present the case of a female neonate with clinical features
of YVS and normal FIG4 sequencing; exome sequencing identified biallelic rare
coding variants in VAC14. Cultured patient fibroblasts exhibited a YVS-like
vacuolation phenotype ameliorated in a dose-dependent fashion by ML-SA1, a
pharmacological activator of the lysosomal PtdIns(3,5)P2 effector TRPML1. The
patient developed a diffuse leukoencephalopathy with loss of the normal
N-acetylaspartate spectrographic peak and presence of a large abnormal peak
consistent with myoinositol. We report that VAC14 is a second gene for
Yunis-Varón syndrome.
