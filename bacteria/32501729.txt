Rationale: A subpopulation of B cells (age-associated B cells [ABCs]) is
increased in mice and humans with infections or autoimmune diseases. Because
depletion of these cells might be valuable in patients with certain lung
diseases, the goal was to find out if ABC-like cells were at elevated levels in
such patients.Objectives: To measure ABC-like cell percentages in patients with
lung granulomatous diseases.Methods: Peripheral blood and BAL cells from patients
with sarcoidosis, beryllium sensitivity, or hypersensitivity pneumonitis and
healthy subjects were analyzed for the percentage of B cells that were ABC-like, 
defined by expression of CD11c, low levels of CD21, FcRL 1-5 (Fc receptor-like
protein 1-5) expression, and, in some cases, T-bet.Measurements and Main Results:
ABC-like cells in blood were at low percentages in healthy subjects and higher
percentages in patients with sarcoidosis as well as at high percentages among BAL
cells of patients with sarcoidosis, beryllium disease, and hypersensitivity
pneumonitis. Treatment of patients with sarcoidosis led to reduced percentages of
ABC-like cells in blood.Conclusions: Increased levels of ABC-like cells in
patients with sarcoidosis may be useful in diagnosis. The increase in percentage 
of ABC-like cells in patients with lung granulomatous diseases and decrease in
treated patients suggests that depletion of these cells may be valuable.
