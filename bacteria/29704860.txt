BACKGROUND: Retinal degeneration is a condition ensued by various ocular
disorders such as artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, retrolental fibroplasia
and retinitis pigmentosa which cause abnormal loss of photoreceptor cells and
lead to eventual vision impairment. No efficient treatment has yet been found,
however, the use of stem cell therapy such as bone marrow and embryonic stem
cells has opened a new treatment modality for retinal degenerative diseases. The 
major goal of this study is to analyze the potential of endothelial progenitor
cells derived from bone marrow to differentiate into retinal neural cells for
regenerative medicine purposes.
METHODS: In this study, endothelial progenitor cells were induced in-vitro with
photoreceptor growth factor (taurine) for 21 days. Subsequently, the morphology
and gene expression of CRX and RHO of the photoreceptors-induced EPCs were
examined through immunostaining assay.
FINDINGS: The results indicated that the induced endothelial progenitor cells
demonstrated positive gene expression of CRX and RHO. Our findings suggested that
EPC cells may have a high advantage in cell replacement therapy for treating eye 
disease, in addition to other neural diseases, and may be a suitable cell source 
in regenerative medicine for eye disorders.
