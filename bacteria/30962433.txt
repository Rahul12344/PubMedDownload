Bacterial degradation of organosulfonates plays an important role in sulfur
recycling, and has been extensively studied. However, this process in anaerobic
bacteria especially gut bacteria is little known despite of its potential
significant impact on human health with the production of toxic H2S. Here, we
describe the structural and biochemical characterization of an oxygen-sensitive
enzyme that catalyzes the radical-mediated C-S bond cleavage of isethionate to
form sulfite and acetaldehyde. We demonstrate its involvement in pathways that
enables C2 sulfonates to be used as terminal electron acceptors for anaerobic
respiration in sulfate- and sulfite-reducing bacteria. Furthermore, it plays a
key role in converting bile salt-derived taurine into H2S in the
disease-associated gut bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia. The enzymes and
transporters in these anaerobic pathways expand our understanding of microbial
sulfur metabolism, and help deciphering the complex web of microbial pathways
involved in the transformation of sulfur compounds in the gut.
