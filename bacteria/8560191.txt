Interleukin (IL-)10 has been demonstrated to inhibit endotoxin-induced production
of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The present study sought to compare
the appearances in the circulation of IL-10, IL-6 and IL-8, and to assess the
roles of endogenously produced platelet-activating factor (PAF) and IL-6 in IL-10
release during endotoxaemia in chimpanzees. Intravenous injection of endotoxin
(lot EC-5, 4 ng/kg, n = 8) induced a transient rise in serum IL-10
concentrations, peaking after 2 h (213 +/- 70 pg/ml; P < 0.05). No correlations
existed between peak IL-10 levels, and peak IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Neither
infusion of the specific PAF antagonist TCV-309 (n = 4), nor infusion of a
neutralizing anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (n = 4) influenced endotoxin-induced
IL-10 release. IL-10 release elicited by injection of endotoxin is not mediated
by PAF or IL6.
