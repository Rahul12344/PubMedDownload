OBJECTIVES/DESIGN: Chronic inflammation is increasingly being linked to
ischaemia, but the mechanism is poorly understood, and little is known about its 
effect on local gastric endothelial microvessels. We aimed at studying the number
and surface area of gastric mucosal endothelial microstructures in the presence
or absence of chronic gastritis.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical assessments were carried out on gastric antral and
body biopsies taken from patients with chronic gastritis and others with normal
histology. The primary antibody (QB-END/10) was raised against CD34 antigen
within the endothelial cell membranes. A computer attached to a microscope was
used to count the number and measure the surface area of mucosal endothelial
entities.
RESULTS: In patients with Helicobacter pylori gastritis (n = 19), the median
number of endothelial microstructures per section was 43 in the antrum and 86 in 
the gastric body, compared with 205 (P = 0.00004) and 165 (P = 0.002),
respectively, in subjects with normal gastric histology (n = 11). The median
surface area of the endothelial microstructures was also reduced in patients with
gastritis. The normal gastric antrum had more endothelial entities than the
normal body (median of 205 vs 165; P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Within the normal stomach, the antrum is more richly vascularized
than the gastric body. However, active chronic gastritis is associated with
reduction in both the number and surface area of mucosal endothelial
microstructures, with the reduction being more marked in the antrum. This is
different from acute inflammation, and is relevant to our understanding of the
natural history of mucosal defence, particularly the greater susceptibility of
the gastric antrum to ulceration, compared with the gastric body.
