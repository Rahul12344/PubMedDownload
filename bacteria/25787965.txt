With the alarming resistance to currently used antibiotics, there is a serious
worldwide threat to public health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search
for new antibiotics or new cellular targets which are essential for survival of
the pathogens. However, during the past 50 years, only two new classes of
antibiotics (oxazolidinone and lipopeptides) have reached the clinic. This
suggests that the success rate in discovering new/novel antibiotics using
conventional approaches is limited and that we must reconsider our antibiotic
discovery approaches. While many new strategies are being pursued lately, this
review primarily focuses only on a few of these novel/new approaches for
antibiotic discovery. These include structure-based drug design (SBDD), the
genomic approach, anti-virulence strategy, targeting nonmultiplying bacteria and 
the use of bacteriophages. In general, recent advancements in nuclear magnetic
resonance, Xcrystallography, and genomic evolution have significant impact on
antibacterial drug research. This review therefore aims to discuss recent
strategies in searching new antibacterial agents making use of these technical
novelties, their advantages, disadvantages and limitations.
