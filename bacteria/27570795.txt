Natural killer T (NKT) cells comprise an important immunoregulatory T cell subset
and express cell surface proteins characteristic of both natural killer cells and
T cells. Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are activated by lipid antigen presented in
the context of CD1d molecules, in contrast to classic T cell subsets, which
recognize peptide antigens presented by MHC molecules. Following activation, iNKT
cells rapidly secrete large amounts of cytokines and can lyse tumor cells and
virally infected cells; however, iNKT cells are reduced in patients with
autoimmune disease and cancer. The potential to characterize and investigate the 
prospective use of iNKT cells for therapeutic purposes has significantly
increased with the ability to stimulate and expand human iNKT cells. In this
protocol, we describe a method to generate and propagate primary human iNKT
cells. Specifically, primary iNKT cells were isolated from human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC), and then expanded periodically with irradiated Î±-GalCer
loaded autologous immature dendritic cells (DC) in the presence of human IL-2.
