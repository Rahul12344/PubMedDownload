In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoreactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are implicated in
the destruction of insulin-producing β cells. The HLA-B*3906 and HLA-A*2402 class
I genes confer increased risk and promote early disease onset, suggesting that
CD8+ T cells that recognize peptides presented by these class I molecules on
pancreatic β cells play a pivotal role in the autoimmune response. We examined
the frequency and phenotype of circulating preproinsulin (PPI)-specific and
insulin B (InsB)-specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children newly diagnosed
with T1D and in high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children before the appearance of
disease-specific autoantibodies and before diagnosis of T1D. Antigen-specific
CD8+ T cells were detected using human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I tetramers 
and flow cytometry was used to assess memory status. In HLA-B*3906+ children with
T1D, we observed an increase in PPI5-12 -specific transitional memory CD8+ T
cells compared to non-diabetic, age- and HLA-matched subjects. Furthermore,
PPI5-12 -specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B*3906+ children with T1D showed a
significantly more antigen-experienced phenotype compared to polyclonal CD8+ T
cells. In longitudinal samples from high-risk HLA-A*2402+ children, the
percentage of terminal effector cells within the InsB15-24 -specific CD8+ T cells
was increased before diagnosis relative to samples taken before the appearance of
autoantibodies. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to report
HLA-B*3906-restricted autoreactive CD8+ T cells in T1D. Collectively, our results
provide evidence that β cell-reactive CD8+ T cells restricted by
disease-associated HLA class I molecules display an antigen-experienced phenotype
and acquire enhanced effector function during the period leading to clinical
diagnosis, implicating these cells in driving disease.
