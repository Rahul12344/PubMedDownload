Aim: The aim of this research was to determine the angiogenesis activity of
Jatropha curcas latex in cream formulation on CD34 immune expression during wound
healing phase in mice skin.
Materials and Methods: Amount of 36 2-month-old male mice were used between 30
and 40 g. To surgical procedures, wound skin incision was performed 2.0 cm in
length until subcutaneous on the paravertebral of each animal. The treatment was 
carried under locally anesthetized with procaine cream. All mice were divided
into four groups, namely the base cream as control group (A), sulfadiazine 0.1%
cream (B), Jatropha curcas latex cream 10% (C), and J. curcas latex cream 15%
(D). All groups were treated entire surface of wound. All experiments were
performed twice a day for 10 days. Experiments were terminated on days 3, 7, and 
10, respectively. The wound healing was assayed in stained histological section
in immunohistochemical of the wounds. The CD34 expression was investigated under 
a microscope.
Results: The results showed that the cream from 10% and 15% latex J. curcas
revealed moderate immune reaction to CD34 on days 3 and 7 in wound healing of
mice skin.
Conclusion: We concluded that the cream from 10% and 15% latex J. curcas has
potential as angiogenesis activity in wound healing of mice skin.
