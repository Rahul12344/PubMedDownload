Rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS) is an important infectious disease caused by
Flavobacterium psychrophilum affecting farmed salmonids worldwide. Other
Flavobacterium psychrophilum-like species (F. plurextorum, F. oncorhynchi, F.
tructae, F. collinsii and F. piscis) have been isolated from diseased rainbow
trout fry suspected of RTFS although the epidemiological and clinical relevance
of these pathogens are unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
potential use of MALDI-TOF (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of
Flight) Mass Spectrometry as method for specific identification of F.
psychrophilum and its differentiation from other F. psychrophilum-like species
isolated from diseased fish. Fifty-three isolates were analyzed after the
creation of the Main Spectrum Profile (MSP) of reference strains of each of
abovementioned species. F. psychrophilum exhibited a mass spectra very different 
from those of F. psychrophilum-like species, with five peaks (m/z 3654, 4585,
5388, 6730 and 7310) present only in F. psychrophilum isolates, and three peaks
(m/z 6170, 7098 and 9241) absent in F. psychrophilum but present in all F.
psychrophilum-like species. All F. psychrophilum isolates were correctly
identified and differentiated from the F. psychrophilum-like species by
MALDI-TOF. Although this approach showed a limited ability to differentiate among
F. psychrophilum-like species, its complementation with a few simple biochemical 
tests may represent an alternative approach for the routine identification of the
Flavobacterium psychrophilum-like species.
