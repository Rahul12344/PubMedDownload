Nitric oxide (NO) protects the heart against ischemic injury; however, NO- and
superoxide-dependent S-nitrosylation (S-NO) of cysteines can affect function of
target proteins and play a role in disease outcome. We employed 2D-GE with
thiol-labeling FL-maleimide dye and MALDI-TOF MS/MS to capture the quantitative
changes in abundance and S-NO proteome of HF patients (versus healthy controls, n
= 30/group). We identified 93 differentially abundant (59-increased/34-decreased)
and 111 S-NO-modified (63-increased/48-decreased) protein spots, respectively, in
HF subjects (versus controls, fold-change | ≥1.5|, p ≤ 0.05). Ingenuity pathway
analysis of proteome datasets suggested that the pathways involved in phagocytes'
migration, free radical production, and cell death were activated and fatty acid 
metabolism was decreased in HF subjects. Multivariate adaptive regression splines
modeling of datasets identified a panel of proteins that will provide >90%
prediction success in classifying HF subjects. Proteomic profiling identified
ATP-synthase, thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), and vinculin (VCL) as top differentially 
abundant and S-NO-modified proteins, and these proteins were verified by Western 
blotting and ELISA in different set of HF subjects. We conclude that differential
abundance and S-NO modification of proteins serve as a mechanism in regulating
cell viability and free radical production, and THBS1 and VCL evaluation will
potentially be useful in the prediction of heart failure.
