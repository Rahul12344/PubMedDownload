The importance of microbial natural compounds in drug research is increasing
every year and they are used to prevent or treat a variety of diseases. Hypomyces
chrysospermus is a cosmopolitan parasite of many Boletaceae members. Since not
much work has been conducted to date, this study is undertaken to explore the
anticancer effect, including the antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity of
Hypomyces chrysospermus. The aim of this study is to determine the
antiproliferative and antimetastatic activity of Hypomyces chrysospermus ethyl
acetate extract, having antioxidant activity, against A549, Caco2, MCF-7 human
cancer and CCD-19 Lu and CCD 841 CoN healthy human cell lines. Firstly, cytotoxic
activity was determined by the WST-1 assay. After cell proliferations and
anti-metastatic effects were investigated by a real-time cell analysis system
(RTCA-DP) and IC50 concentrations were calculated for each cell line. In
addition, the expression levels of Apaf-1, TNF and NF-kB mRNA in cancer cells
were investigated with RealTime-PCR. The ethyl acetate extract of Hypomyces
chrysospermus presented anticancer activities including antiproliferative and
antimetastatic effects. Hypomyces chrysospermus as a source of biologically
active metabolites can be used as an important resource in the development of new
anticancer effective agents.
