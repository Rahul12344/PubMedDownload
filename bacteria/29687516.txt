Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi establish symbiotic interactions with plants,
providing the host plant with minerals, i.e. phosphate, in exchange for organic
carbon. Arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi of the order Glomerales produce vesicles
which store lipids as an energy and carbon source. Acyl-acyl carrier protein
(ACP) thioesterases (Fat) are essential components of the plant plastid-localized
fatty acid synthase and determine the chain length of de novo synthesized fatty
acids. In addition to the ubiquitous FatA and FatB thioesterases, AM-competent
plants contain an additional, AM-specific, FatM gene. Here, we characterize FatM 
from Lotus japonicus by phenotypically analyzing fatm mutant lines and by
studying the biochemical function of the recombinant FatM protein. Reduced shoot 
phosphate content in fatm indicates compromised symbiotic phosphate uptake due to
reduced arbuscule branching, and the fungus shows reduced lipid accumulation
accompanied by the occurrence of smaller and less frequent vesicles. Lipid
profiling reveals a decrease in mycorrhiza-specific phospholipid forms, AM fungal
signature fatty acids (e.g. 16:1ω5, 18:1ω7 and 20:3) and storage lipids.
Recombinant FatM shows preference for palmitoyl (16:0)-ACP, indicating that large
amounts of 16:0 fatty acid are exported from the plastids of arbuscule-containing
cells. Stable isotope labeling with [13 C2 ]acetate showed reduced incorporation 
into mycorrhiza-specific fatty acids in the fatm mutant. Therefore, colonized
cells reprogram plastidial de novo fatty acid synthesis towards the production of
extra amounts of 16:0, which is in agreement with previous results that fatty
acid-containing lipids are transported from the plant to the fungus.
