We report a case of V. cholerae non-O1 / non-O139 bacteremia in an 81-year-old
woman with abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, liquid stools, choluria and jaundice,
while visiting a rural area without access to potable water. The identification
was made by the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique and subsequently the
non-toxigenic non-O1 / non-139 strain was confirmed in the national reference
laboratory. The molecular characterization demonstrated the absence of the
cholera toxin gene (CTX), and the TCP pilus, however, presented 5 of 6 virulence 
genes present in an island of homologous pathogenicity named VPaI-7 of V.
parahaemolyticus (vcs N2 +, vcs C2 +, vcs V2 +, toxR-, vspD +, T vopF +) and in
addition it was positive for hylAy rtxA virulence genes recognized outside the
island. This is the first case reported in Chile of a clinical strain of V.

parahaemolyticus, which codifies for a type III secretion system (TTSS) that
probably contributes to his virulence.
