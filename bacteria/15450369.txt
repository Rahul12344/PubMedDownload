In this work the porin Omp1 of Serratia marcescens was expressed in a porin
deficient mutant (Escherichia coli UH302) and its functionality studied following
the accumulation of ciprofloxacin in bacteria. The protein was extracted,
purified and reconstituted in proteoliposomes of different composition
(lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
(POPC) and, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC)). Maximum
extraction of the detergent was achieved applying different steps of dialysis and
centrifugation. Proteolipid sheets with different composition were spread onto
mica and observed by atomic force microscopy. Two-dimensional crystal of Omp1 was
not observed in any case due to low resolution achieved. Judging from the images 
features POPC is the most suitable phospholipid to enhance 2D lattice formation
for Omp1.
