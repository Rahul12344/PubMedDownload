Background.: Metaanalyses failed to demonstrate clinical benefits of beta lactam 
plus aminoglycoside combination therapy compared to beta lactam monotherapy in
patients with sepsis. However, few data exist on the effects of short-course
adjunctive aminoglycoside therapy in sepsis patients with organ failure or shock.
Methods.: We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with severe sepsis or
septic shock in 2 intensive care units in the Netherlands from 2011 to 2015.
Local antibiotic protocols recommended empirical gentamicin add-on therapy in
only 1 of the units. We used logistic regression analyses to determine the
association between gentamicin use and the number of days alive and free of renal
failure, shock, and death, all on day 14.
Results.: Of 648 patients enrolled, 245 received gentamicin (222 of 309 [72%] in 
hospital A and 23 of 339 [7%] in hospital B) for a median duration of 2 days
(interquartile range, 1-3). The adjusted odds ratios associated with gentamicin
use were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-1.94) for renal failure, 1.34
(95% CI, 0.96-1.86) for shock duration, and 1.41 (95% CI, 0.94-2.12) for day-14
mortality. Based on in vitro susceptibilities, inappropriate (initial)
gram-negative coverage was given in 9 of 245 (4%) and 18 of 403 (4%) patients
treated and not treated with gentamicin, respectively (P = .62).
Conclusions.: Short-course empirical gentamicin use in patients with sepsis was
associated with an increased incidence of renal failure but not with faster
reversal of shock or improved survival in a setting with low prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance.
