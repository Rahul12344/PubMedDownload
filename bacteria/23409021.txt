We report a method for production of soluble heparin binding domain (HBD) of
human vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A165. Recombinant VEGF-A165-HBD
that contains four disulphide bridges was expressed in specialised E. coli
SHuffle cells and its activity has been confirmed through interactions with
neuropilin and heparin. The ability to produce significant quantities of a
soluble active form of VEGF-A(165)-HBD will enable further studies addressing the
role of VEGF-A in essential processes such as angiogenesis, vasculogenesis and
vascular permeability.
