Stimulation of tumor-specific responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells has been a 
challenge for effective tumor vaccines. We designed a vaccine vector containing
the AIDA-1 autotransporter and DNA vaccine elements, generating a murine melanoma
vaccine that was delivered by the attenuated Salmonella strain SL7207. Growth of 
murine subcutaneous melanoma was significantly inhibited by intranasal
immunization with the Salmonella tumor vaccine. The vaccine activated
tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses, with increased T-cell
proliferation, tumor antigen-specific Th1 cytokine production, increased
percentages of tetramer positive cells, and cytotoxicity. CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell
depletion resulted in the loss of antitumor activity of the Salmonella tumor
vaccine, suggesting that the efficacy of the vaccine was dependent on both CD4+
and CD8+ T cells. Lung metastasis of the tumor was also inhibited by vaccine
treatment. Similarly, the percentages of tumor-specific Th1 cytokine production
by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the spleen, tumor, and bronchoalveolar lavage were
increased after vaccine treatment. Tumor-specific proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells was also promoted by the vaccine. Tetramer staining and cytotoxicity
assay showed enhanced tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell response after vaccine
treatment. Therefore, the Salmonella tumor vaccine could activate both
tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. This vaccine strategy may be
widely applicable to the development of oral or nasal vaccines against tumors.
