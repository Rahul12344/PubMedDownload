Comprehensive oncology research suggests an important role of phytochemicals or
whole plant foods in the modulation of signaling pathways associated with
anticancer action. The goal of this study is to assess the anticancer activities 
of Cinnamomum zeylanicum L. using rat, mouse, and cell line breast carcinoma
models. C. zeylanicum (as bark powder) was administered in the diet at two
concentrations of 0.1% (w/w) and 1% (w/w) during the whole experiment in
chemically induced rat mammary carcinomas and a syngeneic 4T1 mouse model. After 
autopsy, histopathological and molecular evaluations of mammary gland tumors in
rodents were carried out. Moreover, in vitro analyses using MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 
cells were performed. The dominant metabolites present in the tested C.
zeylanicum essential oil (with relative content over 1%) were cinnamaldehyde,
cinnamaldehyde dimethyl acetal, cinnamyl acetate, eugenol, linalool, eucalyptol, 
limonene, o-cymol, and α-terpineol. The natural mixture of mentioned molecules
demonstrated significant anticancer effects in our study. In the mouse model, C. 
zeylanicum at a higher dose (1%) significantly decreased tumor volume by 44% when
compared to controls. In addition, treated tumors showed a significant
dose-dependent decrease in mitotic activity index by 29% (0.1%) and 45.5% (1%) in
comparison with the control group. In rats, C. zeylanicum in both doses
significantly reduced the tumor incidence by 15.5% and non-significantly
suppressed tumor frequency by more than 30% when compared to controls. An
evaluation of the mechanism of anticancer action using valid oncological markers 
showed several positive changes after treatment with C. zeylanicum.
Histopathological analysis of treated rat tumor specimens showed a significant
decrease in the ratio of high-/low-grade carcinomas compared to controls. In
treated rat carcinomas, we found caspase-3 and Bax expression increase. On the
other hand, we observed a decrease in Bcl-2, Ki67, VEGF, and CD24 expressions and
MDA levels. Assessment of epigenetic changes in rat tumor cells in vivo showed a 
significant decrease in lysine methylation status of H3K4m3 and H3K9m3 in the
high-dose treated group, a dose-dependent increase in H4K16ac levels (H4K20m3 was
not changed), down-regulations of miR21 and miR155 in low-dose cinnamon groups
(miR22 and miR34a were not modulated), and significant reduction of the
methylation status of two out of five gene promoters-ATM and TIMP3 (PITX2,
RASSF1, PTEN promoters were not changed). In vitro study confirmed results of
animal studies, in that the essential oil of C. zeylanicum displayed significant 
anticancer efficacy in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells (using MTS, BrdU, cell cycle,
annexin V/PI, caspase-3/7, Bcl-2, PARP, and mitochondrial membrane potential
analyses). As a conclusion, C. zeylanicum L. showed chemopreventive and
therapeutic activities in animal breast carcinoma models that were also
significantly confirmed by mechanistic evaluations in vitro and in vivo.
