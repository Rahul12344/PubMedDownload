The Delayed type hypersensitivity skin test (DTH) and interferon-gamma assay are 
used for the diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis (TBB). The specificity of these
diagnoses, however, is compromised because both are based on the response against
purified protein derivative of Mycobacterium bovis (PPD-B). In this study, we
assessed the potential of two cocktails containing M. bovis recombinant proteins:
cocktail 1 (C1): ESAT-6, CFP-10 and MPB83 and cocktail 2 (C2): ESAT-6, CFP-10,
MPB83, HspX, TB10.3, and MPB70. C1, C2, and PPD-B showed similar response by DTH 
in M. bovis-sensitized guinea pigs. Importantly, C1 induced a lower response than
PPD-B in M. avium-sensitized guinea pigs. In cattle, C1 displayed better
performance than PPD-B and C2; indeed, C1 showed the least detection of animals
either vaccinated or Map-infected. To optimize the composition of the cocktails, 
we obtained protein fractions from PPD-B and tested their immunogenicity in
experimentally M. bovis-infected cattle. In one highly reactive fraction, seven
proteins were identified. The inclusion of FixB in C1 enhanced the recognition of
M. bovis-infected cattle without compromising specificity. Our data provide a
promising basis for the future development of a cocktail for TBB detection
without interference by the presence of sensitized or infected animals with other
mycobacteria.
