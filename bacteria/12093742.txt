The Fanconi anaemia (FA) nuclear complex (composed of the FA proteins A, C, G and
F) is essential for protection against chromosome breakage. It activates the
downstream protein FANCD2 by monoubiquitylation; this then forges an association 
with the BRCA1 protein at sites of DNA damage. Here we show that the recently
identified FANCE protein is part of this nuclear complex, binding both FANCC and 
FANCD2. Indeed, FANCE is required for the nuclear accumulation of FANCC and
provides a critical bridge between the FA complex and FANCD2. Disease-associated 
FANCC mutants do not bind to FANCE, cannot accumulate in the nucleus and are
unable to prevent chromosome breakage.
