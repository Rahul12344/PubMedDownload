Cupriavidus metallidurans has been mostly studied because of its resistance to
numerous heavy metals and is increasingly being recovered from other environments
not typified by metal contamination. They host a large and diverse mobile gene
pool, next to their native megaplasmids. Here, we used comparative genomics and
global metabolic comparison to assess the impact of the mobilome on growth
capabilities, nutrient utilization, and sensitivity to chemicals of type strain
CH34 and three isolates (NA1, NA4 and H1130). The latter were isolated from water
sources aboard the International Space Station (NA1 and NA4) and from an invasive
human infection (H1130). The mobilome was expanded as prophages were predicted in
NA4 and H1130, and a genomic island putatively involved in abietane diterpenoids 
metabolism was identified in H1130. An active CRISPR-Cas system was identified in
strain NA4, providing immunity to a plasmid that integrated in CH34 and NA1. No
correlation between the mobilome and isolation environment was found. In
addition, our comparison indicated that the metal resistance determinants and
properties are conserved among these strains and thus maintained in these
environments. Furthermore, all strains were highly resistant to a wide variety of
chemicals, much broader than metals. Only minor differences were observed in the 
phenomes (measured by phenotype microarrays), despite the large difference in
mobilomes and the variable (shared by two or three strains) and strain-specific
genomes.
