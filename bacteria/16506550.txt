An outbreak of acute diarrhoeal disease occurred in Dhalai and North Tripura
district, Tripura during month of May 2004. An investigation was done to identify
causative agent with anti microbial susceptibility pattern and to know the
epidemiological feature. Overall attack rate and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) was
18.8%. and 6.9/1000 respectively. Vibrio cholerae O1 biotype El Tor, Ogawa was
isolated as sole pathogen in 40% of hospitalized acute diarrhoea patient and from
a water samples examined. The strains were sensitive to Tetracycline,
Doxycycline, Norfloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Chloramphenicol, and Azithromycin. Bad
peridomestic sanitation, use of contaminated surface water along with low
literacy, lack of personal hygiene, frequent movement might be the factor
associated with persistence and spread of pathogen amongst tribal groups leading 
to outbreak of cholera.
