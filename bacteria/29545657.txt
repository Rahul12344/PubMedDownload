caspofungin testing under the rug, and solving the ECV shrug.

There are several new hot topics in antifungals and antifungal susceptibility
testing. In this review, four topics of general interest to the clinical
microbiology community are discussed. The first topic is the introduction of
isavuconazole, a new triazole approved for clinical use in the US. The second is 
triazole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus isolates. A specific set of
mutations are being found with greater frequency in isolates globally, including 
the US. The third topic of interest is a word of caution about antifungal
susceptibility testing for caspofungin in Candida isolates; some laboratories
have reported susceptible isolates with high MIC values that would be interpreted
as resistant. The final topic is an introduction to epidemiological cutoff values
and their use in the clinical mycology laboratory.
