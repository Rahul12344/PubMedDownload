BACKGROUND: In a murine model of allergic inflammation, Bifidobacterium breve
M-16V has been shown to reduce IL-4 and IgE by inducing IL-10 and IFN-γ. However,
it remains unknown whether this strain has the same effect in humans with
allergic disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of Bifidobacterium breve M-16V combined with 
a prebiotic oligosaccharide mixture (synbiotic) on atopic markers, ex vivo
cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and circulating
regulatory T cell percentage in infants with atopic dermatitis.
METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre trial, 90 infants
with atopic dermatitis, age <7 months, were randomized to receive an infant
formula with Bifidobacterium breve M-16V and a mixture of short chain
galactooligosaccharides and long chain fructooligosaccharides (Immunofortis(®) ),
or the same formula without synbiotics during 12 weeks. At week 0 and 12, plasma 
levels of IL-5, IgG1, IgG4, CTACK and TARC, ex vivo cytokine responses by PBMCs
and percentage of regulatory T cells, were determined.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the synbiotic and the
placebo group in IL-5, IgG1, IgG4, CTACK and TARC levels and ex vivo cytokine
production by anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated PBMCs. With allergen-specific
stimuli, we found a decreased IL-12p40/70 and IL-12p70 production in response to 
egg allergen (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01, respectively) and decreased IL-12p70
production in response to peanut allergen (P = 0.003) in the synbiotic compared
with the placebo group. Circulating regulatory T cell percentage did not
significantly differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This synbiotic mixture has no detectable
effect on plasma levels of the analysed atopic disease markers, ex vivo cytokine 
production and circulating regulatory T cell percentage in infants with atopic
dermatitis, besides down-regulation of IL-12 production in egg- and
peanut-stimulated PBMCs. These results do not support the use of this synbiotic
in clinical practice.
