Dipeptidylpeptidase IV/CD26 is expressed on the surface of various cell types.
Through its enzymatic activity, its major function is to cleave the N-terminal
dipeptide from diverse molecules including members of the chemokine family of
cytokines. The N-terminus of these chemokines is important for activation of and 
binding to seven-transmembrane G-protein linked chemokine receptors, and early
studies showed truncation by CD26 physiologically alters these properties of
select chemokines resulting in diverse functional outcomes. Stromal-derived
factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), a chemokine involved in hematopoietic cell chemotaxis,
homing, mobilization and survival, is cleaved by CD26 producing a form that is
inactive in CXCR4 signaling and has some antagonistic properties in vitro. Recent
studies have shown that the inhibition of cell-surface CD26 peptidase activity on
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSC/HPC) populations increases their
SDF-1/CXCL12 directed chemotaxis in vitro, and in vivo homing and engraftment.
CD26 inhibition may, therefore, represent a novel approach to increasing the
efficacy and success of HSC/HPC transplantation, especially under conditions of
limiting donor cell yield.
