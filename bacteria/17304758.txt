Before the Second World War, the plague was still rife in North Africa but
occurred only as sporadic cases or small outbreaks as in Egypt or Morocco. The
permanent foci of infected wild rodent were the cause of these rural outbreaks.
In 1943 and 1944, plague came back in several Mediterranean towns and ports and
was considered as a serious danger for the Allied Forces. These resurgences were 
related to the World War as well as the overpopulation of the cities, regroupings
and population movements, relaxation of prophylactic measures of the plague in
sea transport. The Allied Forces medical officers then showed the resistance of
Yersinia pestis to penicillin which they had been supplied with recently, the
effectiveness of sulphamides but mortality remained high (27%). In parallel, the 
drastic fight against rodents and fleas (DDT) gave excellent results.
