A 50 kDa protease designated as VPP1 was purified from the culture supernatant of
a clinical strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus by ammonium sulfate fractionation,
Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration and Fractogel EMD TMAE 650 ion-exchange
chromatography. VPP1 was inhibited by EDTA, EGTA and serine protease inhibitors, 
suggesting that it is a calcium-dependent serine protease. N-terminal amino acid 
sequence of VPP1 was quite similar to that of V. metschnikovii protease and
antibody against VPP1 inhibited the activity of V. metschnikovii protease,
suggesting the similarity of the two proteases. It was demonstrated that VPP1 or 
its related protease widely distribute in not only V. parahaemolyticus but also
V. alginolyticus.
