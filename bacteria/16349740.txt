During sanitation-inspections of 29 potato-processing firms, 2,544 finished
product units and 1,654 samples were collected and analyzed bacteriologically.
The results of the bacteriological examination of finished French fries, fried
potato cylinders, and dehydrated potatoes usually did not reveal the conditions
of cleanliness under which they were produced. This was most likely due to the
lethal effect of the terminal fry to which the French fries and potato cylinders 
are subjected, and because of the lethal effect of the dehydration temperatures
used in processing the dehydrated potato products. However, as in most
food-processing firms, line samples collected at each processing step reflect
sanitary conditions and provide bacteriological support of inspectional evidence 
of plant insanitation. Most of the frozen stuffed baked potatoes examined were
produced under poor sanitary conditions. But because this product is usually
processed while hot, bacteriological examination of the finished product did not 
usually reveal the conditions of cleanliness under which they were produced.
Again, inspectional observations were necessary for a full evaluation of the
conditions of production. In contrast, frozen potato patties and frozen hash
brown potatoes were more likely to reveal the conditions of sanitation under
which they were produced as evidenced by the varying bacterial counts.
