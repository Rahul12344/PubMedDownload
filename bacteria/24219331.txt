Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a disease with a highly variable
prognosis. The clinical course can however be predicted thanks to prognostic
markers. Poor prognosis is associated with expression of a B cell receptor (BCR) 
from unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain genes (IGHV) and expression of
zeta-associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP70). The reason why ZAP70 expression is
associated with poor prognosis and whether the protein has a direct pathogenic
function is at present unknown. By transfer of ZAP70 to CLL cells, we show here
that expression of ZAP70 in CLL cells leads to increased expression of the
nuclear factor (NF)-κB target genes interleukin-1β (IL1B), IL6 and IL8 upon BCR
triggering. This could be blocked by inhibition of NF-κB signalling through
inhibition of IκB kinases (IKK). Transcriptome analysis identified a NF-κB RELA
signature imposed by ZAP70 expression in BCR-stimulated CLL cells. We conclude
that ZAP70 acts directly as an amplifier of NF-κB signalling in CLL cells which
could be an underlying mechanism for its association with poor prognosis and
which may represent a therapeutic target.
