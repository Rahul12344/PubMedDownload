Accumulation of CD3(+) T-cell receptor (TCR)αβ(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) double-negative T
cells (DNT) is a hallmark of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). DNT 
origin and differentiation pathways remain controversial. Here we show that human
ALPS DNT have features of terminally differentiated effector memory T cells
reexpressing CD45RA(+) (TEMRA), but are CD27(+)CD28(+)KLRG1(-) and do not express
the transcription factor T-bet. This unique phenotype was also detected among
CD4(+) or CD8(+) ALPS TEMRA cells. T-cell receptor β deep sequencing revealed a
significant fraction of shared CDR3 sequences between ALPS DNT and both CD4(+)
and CD8(+)TEMRA cells. Moreover, in ALPS patients with a germ line FAS mutation
and somatic loss of heterozygosity, in whom biallelic mutant cells can be tracked
by absent Fas expression, Fas-negative T cells accumulated not only among DNT,
but also among CD4(+) and CD8(+)TEMRA cells. These data indicate that in human
Fas deficiency DNT cannot only derive from CD8(+), but also from CD4(+) T cells. 
Furthermore, defective Fas signaling leads to aberrant transcriptional programs
and differentiation of subsets of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Accumulation of
these cells before their double-negative state appears to be an important early
event in the pathogenesis of lymphoproliferation in ALPS patients.
