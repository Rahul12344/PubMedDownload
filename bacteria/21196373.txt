Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes that share surface
markers and functional characteristics with both conventional T lymphocytes and
natural killer cells. Most NKT cells express a semi-invariant T cell receptor
that reacts with glycolipid antigens presented by the major histocompatibility
complex class I-related protein CD1d on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. 
NKT cells become activated during a variety of infections and inflammatory
conditions, rapidly producing large amounts of immunomodulatory cytokines. NKT
cells can influence the activation state and functional properties of multiple
other cell types in the immune system and, thus, modulate immune responses
against infectious agents, autoantigens, tumors, tissue grafts and allergens. One
attractive aspect of NKT cells is that their immunomodulatory activities can be
readily harnessed with cognate glycolipid antigens, such as the marine
sponge-derived glycosphingolipid alpha-galactosylceramide. These properties of
NKT cells are being exploited for therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat
cancer, infections, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
