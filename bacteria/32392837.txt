Walnut (Juglans regia L.) septum represents an interesting bioactive compound
source by-product. In our study, a rich phenolic walnut septum extract,
previously selected, was further examined. The tocopherol content determined by
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed higher amounts
of α-tocopherol compared to γ- and δ-tocopherols. Moreover, several biological
activities were investigated. The in vitro inhibiting assessment against
acetylcholinesterase, α-glucosidase, or lipase attested a real management
potential in diabetes or obesity. The extract demonstrated very strong
antimicrobial potential against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Salmonella enteritidis. It also revealed moderate (36.08%) and strong (43.27%)
antimutagenic inhibitory effects against TA 98 and TA 100 strains. The
cytotoxicity of the extract was assessed on cancerous (A549, T47D-KBluc, MCF-7)
and normal (human gingival fibroblasts (HGF)) cell lines. Flow cytometry
measurements confirmed the cytotoxicity of the extract in the cancerous cell
lines. Additionally, the extract demonstrated antioxidant activity on all four
cell types, as well as anti-inflammatory activity by lowering the inflammatory
cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin-1 β (IL-1β))
evaluated in HGF cells. To the best of our knowledge, most of the cellular model 
analyses were performed for the first time in this matrix. The results prove that
walnut septum may be a potential phytochemical source for pharmaceutical and food
industry.
