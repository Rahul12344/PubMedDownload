A selective medium for Rothia mucilaginosa (RMSM) was developed to examine the
population of R. mucilaginosa in oral cavities. The growth recovery of R.
mucilaginosa on RMSM was 85.1% relative to HI medium. R. mucilaginosa was
detected at 3.4% of total bacteria from stimulated saliva of 8 subjects.
