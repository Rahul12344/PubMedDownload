Patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD, n = 32) or systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE, n = 60) were typed for HLA-A, B, C, Dw, and DR antigens. All 
patients with SLE fulfilled at least four criteria of SLE and the patients with
MCTD met the criteria proposed by Alarcon-Segovia (1989). The presence of
antibodies to Sm was not considered as an exclusion for MCTD. In the patients
with SLE, Dw3, DR3, and the associated B8 and A1 antigens were increased, whereas
in the patients with MCTD an increased frequency of Dw4 was found (45 v 18% in
controls v 14% in SLE). Of the subtypes of DR4, Dw4 was present in all but one of
the DR4 positive patients. The frequency of DR4 in patients with MCTD (52%)
differed significantly from that of controls (28%). The strong association of
MCTD to one DR4 subtype was further seen in the significantly increased frequency
of the B15, DR4 combination. Thus the genetic background seems to be different in
patients with MCTD from that in patients with SLE. This could partly explain the 
clinical differences between these diseases.
