Clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin CST (C.
spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea,
enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. Here we report on the
recombinant production of the enzyme component (CSTa) and the binding component
(CSTb) of C. spiroforme toxin in Bacillus megaterium. By using the recombinant
toxin components, we show that CST enters target cells via the
lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), which has been recently
identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins Clostridium difficile
transferase (CDT) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Microscopic studies
revealed that CST, but not the related Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin,
colocalized with LSR during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments.
Our findings indicate that CST shares LSR with C. difficile CDT and C.
perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.
