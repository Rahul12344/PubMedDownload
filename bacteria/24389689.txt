Genetically modified T cells to recognize tumor-associated antigens by transgenic
TCRs or chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) have been successfully applied in
clinical trials. However, the disadvantages of either TCR mismatching or the
requirement of a surface tumor antigen limit their wider applications in adoptive
T cell therapy. A TCR-like chimeric receptor, specific for the melanoma-related
gp100/HLA-A2 complex was created by joining a TCR-like antibody GPA7 with the
endodomains of CD28 and CD3-Î¶ chain. This TCR-like CAR, GPA7-28z, was
subsequently introduced into human T cells. Retargeted T cells expressing
GPA7-28z could exhibit efficient cytotoxic activities against human melanoma
cells in vitro in the context with HLA-A2. Furthermore, infusion of
GPA7-28z-transduced T cells suppressed melanoma progression in a xenograft mouse 
model. Redirecting human T cells with TCR-like CARs would be a promising
alternative approach to TCR-mediated therapy for melanoma patients, which is also
feasible for targeting a variety of other tumor antigens.
