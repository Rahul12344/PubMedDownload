Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system
has ushered in a new era of gene therapy. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate 
precise CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing of the splicing mutation c.919-2A > G
in intron 7 of the SLC26A4 gene, which is the second most common causative gene
of congenital hearing loss. We designed candidate single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs)
aimed to direct the targeting of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 to either exon 7 or
exon 8 of SLC26A4. Several of the designed sgRNAs showed targeting activity, with
average indel efficiencies ranging from approximately 14% to 25%. The usage of
dual sgRNAs delivered both into Neuro2a cells and primary mouse embryonic
fibroblasts resulted in the successful removal of large genomic fragments within 
the target locus. We subsequently evaluated genome editing in the presence of
artificial donor templates to induce precise target modification via
homology-directed repair. Using this approach, two different donor plasmids
successfully introduced silent mutations within the c.919-2A region of Slc26a4
without evident off-target activities. Overall, these results indicate that
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated correction of mutations in the Slc26a4 gene is a feasible
therapeutic option for restoration of hearing loss.
