Optimal T cell activation requires engagement of CD28 with its counterligands
B7-1 and B7-2. Inducible costimulator (ICOS) is the third member of the
CD28/CTLA4 family that binds a B7-like protein, B7RP-1. Administration of ICOS-Ig
attenuates T cell expansion following superantigen (SAg) administration, but
fails to regulate either peripheral deletion or anergy induction. ICOS-Ig, but
not CTLA4-Ig, uniquely regulates SAg-induced TNF-alpha production, whereas IL-2
secretion is modulated by CTLA4-Ig, but not ICOS-Ig. In contrast, both ICOS and
CD28 are required for complete attenuation of IL-4 production. Our data suggest
that ICOS and CD28 regulate T cell expansion and that ligation of either CD28 or 
ICOS can either uniquely regulate cytokine production (IL-2/TNF-alpha) or
synergize for optimal cytokine production (IL-4) after SAg administration.
