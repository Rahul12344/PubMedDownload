We are investigating the use of single chain antibody fragments (scFv) in eye
drops for diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases. For ocular use, recombinant
proteins must be free of bacterial endotoxin that causes inflammation in the eye.
We required a means of generating high yields of scFvs with little endotoxin
contamination. Using microprojectile bombardment we produced transgenic lines of 
the commercial wheat variety, Westonia, that express two scFvs that bind to CD4
or CD28 on the surface of rat thymocytes. A high level of expression of active
scFv in the range 50-180 microg/g was measured by quantitative flow cytometry in 
crude extracts made from mature seeds. The levels of expression were stable over 
four generations of transgenic plants and mature seeds were stored for one year
with little loss of scFv activity. Substantial purification of scFv was achieved 
by immobilised metal affinity chromatography. Compared to bacterial extracts,
crude transgenic seed extracts contained only a small amount of endotoxin (150
EU/ml) that will be easily removed by purification. The transgenic wheat lines
express functional scFv at levels comparable to production in bacteria and
promise to be superior to bacteria for production of scFv pharmaceuticals for
ocular use.
