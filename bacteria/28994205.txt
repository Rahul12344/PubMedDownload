Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cell wall glycolipid mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) inhibits CD4+ T-cell activation by inhibiting proximal
T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling when activated by anti-CD3. To understand the
impact of ManLAM on CD4+ T-cell function when both the TCR-CD3 complex and major 
costimulator CD28 are engaged, we performed label-free quantitative MS and
network analysis. Mixed-effect model analysis of peptide intensity identified 149
unique peptides representing 131 proteins that were differentially regulated by
ManLAM in anti-CD3- and anti-CD28-activated CD4+ T cells. Crosstalker, a novel
network analysis tool identified dysregulated translation, TCA cycle, and RNA
metabolism network modules. PCNA, Akt, mTOR, and UBC were found to be bridge node
proteins connecting these modules of dysregulated proteins. Altered PCNA
expression and cell cycle analysis showed arrest at the G2M phase. Western blot
confirmed that ManLAM inhibited Akt and mTOR phosphorylation, and decreased
expression of deubiquitinating enzymes Usp9x and Otub1. Decreased NF-κB
phosphorylation suggested interference with CD28 signaling through inhibition of 
the Usp9x-Akt-mTOR pathway. Thus, ManLAM induced global changes in the CD4+
T-cell proteome by affecting Akt-mTOR signaling, resulting in broad functional
impairment of CD4+ T-cell activation beyond inhibition of proximal TCR-CD3
signaling.
