VCP (Valosin-Containing Protein), a member of the AAA (ATPases Associated to a
variety of cellular Activities) family of proteins, possesses a duplicated highly
conserved ATPase domain. An expressed sequence tag (EST), representing a clone
from the Eimeria tenella merozoite cDNA library, was found to have high
similarity to VCP genes from other organisms. A complete sequence derived from
the corresponding clone (designated eth060) shows amino acid identity of 42-62%
with other members of the VCP subfamily. Sequence analysis identified a putative 
ATPase domain in the eth060 sequence. This domain was PCR-amplified using
gene-specific primers and cloned into a pBAD/Thio-TOPO expression vector.
Expression in Escherichia coli demonstrated that the putative ATPase domain,
which consists of 414 amino acid residues, produced a fusion protein of
approximately 60 kDa in size.
