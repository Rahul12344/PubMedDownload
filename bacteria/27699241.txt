We created and tested multi-epitope DNA or protein vaccines with TLR4 ligand
emulsion adjuvant (gluco glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant in a stable emulsion
[GLA-SE]) for their ability to protect against Toxoplasma gondii in HLA
transgenic mice. Our constructs each included 5 of our best down-selected CD8+ T 
cell-eliciting epitopes, a universal CD4+ helper T lymphocyte epitope (PADRE),
and a secretory signal, all arranged for optimal MHC-I presentation. Their
capacity to elicit immune and protective responses was studied using immunization
of HLA-A*11:01 transgenic mice. These multi-epitope vaccines increased memory
CD8+ T cells that produced IFN-Î³ and protected mice against parasite burden when 
challenged with T. gondii. Endocytosis of emulsion-trapped protein and cross
presentation of the antigens must account for the immunogenicity of our
adjuvanted protein. Thus, our work creates an adjuvanted platform assembly of
peptides resulting in cross presentation of CD8+ T cell-eliciting epitopes in a
vaccine that prevents toxoplasmosis.
