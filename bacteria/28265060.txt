In MtrF, an outer-membrane multiheme cytochrome, the 10 heme groups are arranged 
in heme binding domains II and IV along the pseudo-C2 axis, forming the electron 
transfer (ET) pathways. Previous reports based on molecular dynamics simulations 
showed that the redox potential (Em) values for the heme pairs located in
symmetrical positions in domains II and IV were similar, forming bidirectional ET
pathways [Breuer M, Zarzycki P, Blumberger J, Rosso KM (2012) J Am Chem Soc
134(24):9868-9871]. Here, we present the Em values of the 10 hemes in MtrF,
solving the linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation and considering the protonation
states of all titratable residues and heme propionic groups. In contrast to
previous studies, the Em values indicated that the ET is more likely to be
downhill from domain IV to II because of localization of acidic residues in
domain IV. Reduction of hemes in MtrF lowered the Em values, resulting in
switching to alternative downhill ET pathways that extended to the flavin binding
sites. These findings present an explanation of how MtrF serves as an electron
donor to extracellular substrates.
