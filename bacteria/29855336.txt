BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has, in recent years,
emerged as an important tumor cell behavior associated with high metastatic
potential and drug resistance. Interestingly, protein SUMOylation and hepatocyte 
growth factor could respectively reduce the effect of small molecule inhibitors
on tyrosine kinase activity of mutated epidermal growth factor receptor of lung
adenocarcinomas (LADC). The actual mechanism is yet to be resolved.
METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to stain proteins in LADC specimens.
Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting. In vitro, expression of
proteins was determined by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Levels of
circular RNA were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: SAE2 and cirRNA CCDC66 were highly expressed in LADC. Expression of SAE2
was mainly regulated by EGFR; however, expression of cirRNA CCDC66 was positively
regulated by FAK and c-Met but negatively modulated by nAchR7α. EGFR-resistant
H1975 also highly expressed cirRNA CCDC66. Immediate response of hypoxia
increased phosphorylated c-Met, SAE2, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Either activation of FAK or silencing of nAchR7α increased cirRNA CCDC66.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF/c-Met regulates expression of SAE2 and cirRNA CCDC66 to increase
EMT and drug resistance of LADC cells. Multimodality drugs concurrently aiming at
these targets would probably provide more benefits for cancer patients.
