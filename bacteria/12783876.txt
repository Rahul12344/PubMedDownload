Human FcalphaRI (CD89) is the receptor specific for IgA, an immunoglobulin that
is abundant in mucosa and is also found in high concentrations in serum. Although
FcalphaRI is an immunoglobulin Fc receptor (FcR), it differs in many ways from
FcRs for other immunoglobulin classes. The genes of most FcRs are located on
chromosome 1 at 1q21-23, whereas FcalphaRI is on chromosome 19, at 19q13.4, a
region called the leukocyte receptor complex, because it is clustered with
several leukocyte receptor families including killer cell inhibitory receptors
(KIRs) and leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LIRs). The amino acid sequence of
FcalphaRI shares only 20% homology with other FcRs but it has around 35% homology
with its neighboring LIRs and KIRs. In this work, we analyzed the crystal
structure of the ectodomain of FcalphaRI and examined structure similarities
between FcalphaRI and KIR2DL1, KIR2DL2 and LIR-1. Our data show that FcalphaRI,
KIRs, and LIRs share a common hydrophobic core in their interdomain interface,
and FcalphaRI is evolutionally closer to LIR than KIR.
