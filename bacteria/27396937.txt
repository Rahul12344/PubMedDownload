Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked primary immunodeficiency disease
caused by mutations in the gene encoding the WAS protein (WASp). Here, induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were derived from a WAS patient (WAS-iPSC) and the
endogenous chromosomal WAS locus was targeted with a wtWAS-2A-eGFP transgene
using zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) to generate corrected WAS-iPSC (cWAS-iPSC).
WASp and GFP were first expressed in the earliest CD34(+)CD43(+)CD45(-)
hematopoietic precursor cells and later in all hematopoietic lineages examined.
Whereas differentiation to non-lymphoid lineages was readily obtained from
WAS-iPSCs, in vitro T lymphopoiesis from WAS-iPSC was deficient with few
CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive and mature CD3(+) T cells obtained. T cell
differentiation was restored for cWAS-iPSCs. Similarly, defects in natural killer
cell differentiation and function were restored on targeted correction of the WAS
locus. These results demonstrate that the defects exhibited by WAS-iPSC-derived
lymphoid cells were fully corrected and suggests the potential therapeutic use of
gene-corrected WAS-iPSCs.
