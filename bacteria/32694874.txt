Liver macrophages (LMs) have been proposed to contribute to metabolic disease
through secretion of inflammatory cytokines. However, anti-inflammatory drugs
lead to only modest improvements in systemic metabolism. Here we show that LMs do
not undergo a proinflammatory phenotypic switch in obesity-induced insulin
resistance in flies, mice and humans. Instead, we find that LMs produce
non-inflammatory factors, such as insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7
(IGFBP7), that directly regulate liver metabolism. IGFBP7 binds to the insulin
receptor and induces lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis via activation of
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling. We further show that
IGFBP7 is subject to RNA editing at a higher frequency in insulin-resistant than 
in insulin-sensitive obese patients (90% versus 30%, respectively), resulting in 
an IGFBP7 isoform with potentially higher capacity to bind to the insulin
receptor. Our study demonstrates that LMs can contribute to insulin resistance
independently of their inflammatory status and indicates that non-inflammatory
factors produced by macrophages might represent new drug targets for the
treatment of metabolic diseases.
