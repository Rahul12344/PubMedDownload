Occurrence and significance of hemolytic streptococci groups b-u in human
infectious disease.

Nordlander IM, Thal E, Tunevall G.

245 strains of hemolytic streptococci, isolated from 225 patients with infectious
diseasses, were grouped serologically according to Lancefield. About 40% belonged
to group B and half of them were found in the genito-urinary tract. Another 40%
belonged to the groups C and G, half of them being found in the respiratory tract
and often as the only potentially pathogenic organism. About 10% of the isolates 
belonged to other of the groups E to T, including M streptococci, and were found 
under similar circumstances as the C and G isolates. The last 10% could not be
referred to any of the groups A-U. In 4 cases group B streptococci were found as 
the only potentially pathogenic organism in typical erysipelas, and in 4 cases of
septicemia the only bacterial finding from blood was a streptococcus of the
groups B, C or G. In these cases, as in most others in which an etiological
significance could be ascribed to steptococci of other groups than A, the patient
was in a bad general condition, due to very high age, agranulocytosis, ethylism
or narcomania.
