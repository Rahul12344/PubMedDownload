Monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) have a single polypeptide sizing
around 85 kDa. The IDH2 from the opportunistic bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii 
(AbIDH2) with a mass of 83 kDa was formerly recognized as a typical monomeric
IDH. However, both size exclusion chromatography and analytical
ultracentrifugation analysis indicated that AbIDH2 exists as a homodimer in
solution. The crystallographic study of the substrate/coenzyme-free AbIDH2 gave a
dimeric structure and each subunit contained a domain I and a domain II. The
dimeric assembly is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions (16 hydrogen
bonds and 11 salt bridges) from the dimer's interface platform, which centered
around the three parallel helices (α4, α12, and α17) and one loop from the domain
II. Kinetic analysis showed that the dimeric AbIDH2 showed much lower catalytic
efficiency (0.39 μM-1·s-1) as compared to the typical monomeric IDHs (~15
μM-1·s-1). Key residues crucial for dimer formation were simultaneously changed
to generate the mutant mAbIDH2. The disruption of the hydrophobic forces
disassociated the dimeric AbIDH2, making mAbIDH2 a monomeric enzyme. mAbIDH2
sustained specific activity (21.9 ± 2 U/mg) comparable to AbIDH2 (25.4 ± 0.7
U/mg). However, mAbIDH2 proved to be a thermolabile enzyme, indicating that the
thermostable dimeric AbIDH2 may have a physiological significance for the growth 
and pathogenesis of A. baumannii. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the
existence of numerous AbIDH2 homologous proteins, thus expanding the monomeric
IDH protein family.
