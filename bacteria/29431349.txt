BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that vitamin D exerts several functions
other than those implied in the bone homeostasis. It has been published the
vitamin D can act on many cells and tissues behaving also as a modulatory factor 
in the immune responses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of
active vitamin D3 (VD) on the expression of pro-inflammatory and
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and IL-12) in human gingival
fibroblasts (hGF) and human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLc) triggered by
Porphyromonas gingivalis and Streptococcus pyogenes.
METHODS: Primary hGF and hPDLc pretreated or not by VD (10-8 mol/L) were exposed 
to P. gingivalis and S. pyogenes for 24 h. Production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and
IL-12 was evaluated by immunoenzymatic assay. mRNA of the same cytokines were
evaluated by PCR.
RESULTS: IL-6 secretion increased by 25.2% (±2.1) up to 51% (±3.3) in VD treated 
hGF and hPDLc exposed to P. gingivalis and S. pyogenes, compared to VD not
treated cells. IL-8 secretion decreased approximately by 30% in VD-treated hGF
and hPDLc compared to VD not-treated cells. IL-12 secretion decreased by 60%. On 
the contrary, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased by approximately 200%.
mRNA PCR confirmed these results.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the study, the obtained results support the
hypothesis of a modulatory role of VD on periodontal cells exposed to bacterial
infection, reducing their inflammatory response and increasing the secretion of
anti-inflammatory and modulatory cytokines. Consequently, it could be speculated 
that vitamin D assessment, and its possible implementation in deficiency cases,
could play a role in periodontal treatment.
