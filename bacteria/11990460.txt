The bacterial superantigen Staphylococcal enterotoxin-A (SEA), produced by some
strains of Staphylococcus aureus, causes proliferation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
and cytokine production in vivo. SEA has been shown to be highly efficient for
antibody-targeted superantegen immunotherapy for different tumor models. A
candidate B-cell superantigen that has received considerable attention these days
is staphylococcal protein-A (PA). It has been shown to possess multiple
immunological responses. The anti-tumor property of PA is well documented in the 
literature in various transplantable tumors of rats and mice. In the present
study, we have shown that the T-cell superantigen SEA and B-cell superantigen PA 
induce immunomodulatory and anti-tumor activity which is strongly protentiated by
PA + SEA co-administration. Combination treatment with PA and SEA prolongs the
immune response in vivo, limits the development of immunological unresponsiveness
and promotes maximum anti-tumor effects to tumor carrying animals, as compared
with PA or SEA alone. The immune response after combined therapy is characterized
by substantially augmented IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, Nitric oxide and strong CTL
activity. Our data demonstrate that combined PA + SEA therapy induces long-term
survival of the animals, carrying the Ehrlich ascites tumor.
