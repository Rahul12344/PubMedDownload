Sepsis is a common and lethal syndrome: although outcomes have improved,
mortality remains high. No specific anti-sepsis treatments exist; as such,
management of patients relies mainly on early recognition allowing correct
therapeutic measures to be started rapidly, including administration of
appropriate antibiotics, source control measures when necessary, and
resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs when needed. Although 
substantial developments have been made in the understanding of the basic
pathogenesis of sepsis and the complex interplay of host, pathogen, and
environment that affect the incidence and course of the disease, sepsis has
stubbornly resisted all efforts to successfully develop and then deploy new and
improved treatments. Existing models of clinical research seem increasingly
unlikely to produce new therapies that will result in a step change in clinical
outcomes. In this Commission, we set out our understanding of the clinical
epidemiology and management of sepsis and then ask how the present approaches
might be challenged to develop a new roadmap for future research.
