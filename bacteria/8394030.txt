We have characterized a monoclonal antibody (AT389), produced by immunization of 
mice with 4-day-old avian Concanavalin A blasts, which recognizes a 38-40 kDa
homodimer present on the surface of all chicken T cells. AT389 increased the
spontaneous and IL-2-driven proliferation of 3-day-old T-cell blasts. This
antibody, in synergy with IL-2, increased cellular proliferation and cell
survival of T-cell blasts over time. Together, these data suggest that AT389
recognizes a surface protein on avian T cells which may be related to known
stimulatory surface markers on mammalian T cells.
