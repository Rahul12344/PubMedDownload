Actinomycosis is a chronic inflammatory disease rarely observed in the pelvic
form but rather frequently in the cervicofacial tract. The pelviabdominal form is
difficult to diagnose because of its various clinical presentations that can lead
to misdiagnosis by imitating a neoblastic disease, a bowel inflammatory disease, 
an acute diverticulitis or gynecological disorders. The case is reported of a 43 
year old woman with prolonged use of an intrauterine contraceptive device and
with severe phlogosis secondary to extensive pelvic actinomycosis involving both 
ovaries, the urinary duct and the rectosigmoid, misdiagnosed as pelvic frostbite 
presentation of a malignant neoplasm. A bilateral hysterosalpingo-oophorectomy
surgery was performed and a urethral stent was placed before the operation.
Rarely, has the pelvis been so heavily involved by a chronic actinomycosis
infection.
