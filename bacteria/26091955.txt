A bacterium isolated from wastewater sludge, identified as Bacillus subtilis F9, 
was confirmed to produce bioflocculant with excellent flocculation activity. The 
effects of culture conditions such as initial pH, temperature, carbon source,
nitrogen source, and inoculum size on bioflocculant production were studied here.
The results indicated that 2.32g/L of purified bioflocculant could be extracted
with the following optimized conditions: 20gL(-1) sucrose as the carbon source,
3.5gL(-1) peptone as the nitrogen source, an initial pH of 7.0, and a temperature
of 40°C. The purified bioflocculant consisted of 10.1% protein and 88.3% sugar,
including 38.4% neutral sugar, 2.86% uronic acid, and 2.1% amino sugar. The
neutral sugar consisted of sucrose, glucose, lactose, galactose, and mannose at a
molar ratio of 2.7:4.7:3.2:9.1:0.8. Elemental analysis of the purified
bioflocculant revealed that the weight fractions of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, and sulfur were 30.8%, 5.3%, 54.7%, 6.4%, and 2.9%, respectively.
Furthermore, the purified bioflocculant was pH tolerant within the range of 2-8
and thermotolerant from 10°C to 100°C, with optimal activity at pH 7.0 and at a
temperature of 40°C. The purified bioflocculant showed industrial potential for
the treatment of drinking water. Considering these properties, especially its low
molecular weight (5.3×10(4)Da), this bioflocculant with excellent solubility and 
favorable flocculation activity is particularly suited for flocculating small
particles.
