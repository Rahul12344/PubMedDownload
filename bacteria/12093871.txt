B cell entry to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches depends on chemokine receptor
signaling, but the principal chemokine involved has not been defined. Here we
show that the homing of CXCR4-/- B cells is suppressed in CCL19 (ELC)- and CCL21 
(SLC)-deficient paucity of lymph node T cells mice, but not in wild-type mice. We
also find that CXCR4 can contribute to T cell homing. Using intravital
microscopy, we find that B cell adhesion to high endothelial venules (HEVs) is
disrupted when CCR7 and CXCR4 are predesensitized. In Peyer's patches, B cell
entry is dependent on CXCR5 in addition to CCR7/CXCR4. CXCL12 (SDF1) is displayed
broadly on HEVs, whereas CXCL13 (BLC) is found selectively on Peyer's patch
follicular HEVs. These findings establish the principal chemokine and chemokine
receptor requirements for B cell entry to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches.
