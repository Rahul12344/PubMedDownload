The androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide is one of the principal
treatments for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, not
all patients respond, and resistance mechanisms are largely unknown. We
hypothesized that genomic and transcriptional features from metastatic CRPC
biopsies prior to treatment would be predictive of de novo treatment resistance. 
To this end, we conducted a phase II trial of enzalutamide treatment (160 mg/d)
in 36 men with metastatic CRPC. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for the
primary end point of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)50 response (PSA decline
≥50% at 12 wk vs. baseline). Nine patients were classified as nonresponders (PSA 
decline <50%), and 25 patients were classified as responders (PSA decline ≥50%). 
Failure to achieve a PSA50 was associated with shorter progression-free survival,
time on treatment, and overall survival, demonstrating PSA50's utility. Targeted 
DNA-sequencing was performed on 26 of 36 biopsies, and RNA-sequencing was
performed on 25 of 36 biopsies that contained sufficient material. Using
computational methods, we measured AR transcriptional function and performed gene
set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify pathways whose activity state
correlated with de novo resistance. TP53 gene alterations were more common in
nonresponders, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.055). 
AR gene alterations and AR expression were similar between groups. Importantly,
however, transcriptional measurements demonstrated that specific gene
sets-including those linked to low AR transcriptional activity and a stemness
program-were activated in nonresponders. Our results suggest that patients whose 
tumors harbor this program should be considered for clinical trials testing
rational agents to overcome de novo enzalutamide resistance.
