Heme proteins play pivotal roles in a wealth of biological processes. Despite
this, the molecular mechanisms by which heme traverses bilayer membranes for use 
in biosynthetic reactions are unknown. The biosynthesis of c-type cytochromes
requires that heme is transported to the bacterial periplasm or mitochondrial
intermembrane space where it is covalently ligated to two reduced cysteinyl
residues of the apocytochrome. Results herein suggest that a family of integral
membrane proteins in prokaryotes, protozoans, and plants act as transmembrane
heme delivery systems for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes. The complete
topology of a representative from each of the three subfamilies was
experimentally determined. Key histidinyl residues and a conserved
tryptophan-rich region (designated the WWD domain) are positioned at the site of 
cytochrome c assembly for all three subfamilies. These histidinyl residues were
shown to be essential for function in one of the subfamilies, an ABC transporter 
encoded by helABCD. We believe that a directed heme delivery pathway is vital for
the synthesis of cytochromes c, whereby heme iron is protected from oxidation via
ligation to histidinyl residues within the delivery proteins.
