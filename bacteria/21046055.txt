This paper reports a droplet microfluidic, sample-to-answer platform for the
detection of disease biomarkers and infectious pathogens using crude biosamples. 
The platform exploited the dual functionality of silica superparamagnetic
particles (SSP) for solid phase extraction of DNA and magnetic actuation. This
enabled the integration of sample preparation and genetic analysis within
discrete droplets, including the steps of cell lysis, DNA binding, washing,
elution, amplification and detection. The microfluidic device was self contained,
with all reagents stored in droplets, thereby eliminating the need for fluidic
coupling to external reagent reservoirs. The device incorporated unique surface
topographic features to assist droplet manipulation. Pairs of micro-elevations
were created to form slits that facilitated efficient splitting of SSP from
droplets. In addition, a compact sample handling stage, which integrated the
magnet manipulator, the droplet microfluidic device and a Peltier thermal cycler,
was built for convenient droplet manipulation and real-time detection. The
feasibility of the platform was demonstrated by analysing ovarian cancer
biomarker Rsf-1 and detecting Escherichia coli with real time polymerase chain
reaction and real time helicase dependent amplification.
