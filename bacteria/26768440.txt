PURPOSE: Sepsis is a major health burden worldwide. Preclinical investigations in
animals and retrospective studies in patients have suggested that inhibition of
platelets may improve the outcome of sepsis. In this study we investigated
whether chronic antiplatelet therapy impacts on the presentation and outcome of
sepsis, and the host response.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in 972 patients admitted 
with sepsis to the mixed intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals in the
Netherlands between January 2011 and July 2013. Of them, 267 patients (27.5%)
were on antiplatelet therapy (95.9% acetylsalicylic acid) before admission. To
account for differential likelihoods of receiving antiplatelet therapy, a
propensity score was constructed, including variables associated with use of
antiplatelet therapy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate
the association of antiplatelet therapy with mortality.
RESULTS: Antiplatelet therapy was not associated with sepsis severity at
presentation, the primary source of infection, causative pathogens, the
development of organ failure or shock during ICU stay, or mortality up to 90 days
after admission, in either unmatched or propensity-matched analyses. Antiplatelet
therapy did not modify the values of 19 biomarkers providing insight into
hallmark host responses to sepsis, including activation of the coagulation
system, the vascular endothelium, the cytokine network, and renal function,
during the first 4 days after ICU admission.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-existing antiplatelet therapy is not associated with alterations
in the presentation or outcome of sepsis, or the host response.
