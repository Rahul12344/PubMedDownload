There are increasing demands for informative cancer biomarkers, accessible via
minimally invasive procedures, both for initial diagnostics and to follow-up
personalized cancer therapy. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy provides ready
access to relevant tissues; however, the minute sample amounts require sensitive 
multiplex molecular analysis to achieve clinical utility. We have applied
proximity extension assays (PEA) and NanoString (NS) technology for analyses of
proteins and of RNA, respectively, in FNA samples. Using samples from patients
with breast cancer (BC, n = 25) or benign lesions (n = 33), we demonstrate that
these FNA-based molecular analyses (a) can offer high sensitivity and
reproducibility, (b) may provide correct diagnosis in shorter time and at a lower
cost than current practice, (c) correlate with results from routine analysis
(i.e., benchmarking against immunohistochemistry tests for ER, PR, HER2, and
Ki67), and (d) may also help identify new markers related to immunotherapy. A
specific 11-protein signature, including FGF binding protein 1, decorin, and
furin, distinguished all cancer patient samples from all benign lesions in our
main cohort and in smaller replication cohort. Due to the minimally traumatic
sampling and rich molecular information, this combined proteomics and
transcriptomic methodology is promising for diagnostics and evaluation of
treatment efficacy in BC.
