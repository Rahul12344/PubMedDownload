Genetically encoded FRET based biosensors allow one to visualize the spatial and 
temporal evolution of specific enzyme activities in live cells. We have
previously reported the creation of a FRET based biosensor specific for
Zeta-Associated Protein -70 kD (ZAP-70) (Randriamampita et al., 2008), a Syk
family protein tyrosine kinase. ZAP-70 is essential for early T cell receptor
(TCR) signaling events, T lymphocyte development and has also been implicated in 
integrin mediated T lymphocyte migration. In order to facilitate the study of
ZAP-70 kinase activity during dynamic phenomena such as immunological synapse
formation or cell migration, we have designed and prepared a second generation of
ZAP-70 specific biosensors. Here we describe a novel biosensor named ROZA-XL,
that displays a 3-4 times greater dynamic range than its predecessor and
possesses a robust baseline FRET value when expressed in the Jurkat human T cell 
line. We demonstrate that the robust behavior of this biosensor allows for rapid 
analysis of TCR mediated of ZAP-70 kinase activity at a single cell level, as
shown in a simple end point assay in which ROZA-XL expressing cells are allowed
to interact with stimulatory anti-CD3epsilon coated coverslips.
