Limited data is available about the factors affecting early immune recovery or
its clinical significance after autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT). 
We prospectively analyzed factors affecting early immune recovery and outcome
among 72 non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. Absolute lymphocyte count 15 d
after auto-SCT (ALC-15) ≥ 0.5 × 10(9)/L was associated with the use of plerixafor
(p = 0.004), the number of CD34(+) cells (p = 0.015), and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells
(p = 0.005) in the grafts. ALC-15 ≥ 0.5 × 10(9)/L was associated with improved
overall survival (p = 0.021). In patients with aggressive histology,
ALC-15 ≥ 0.5 × 10(9)/L was beneficial in regard to both progression-free survival
(p = 0.015) and overall survival (p = 0.002). Early immune recovery seems to be
important in transplanted patients with NHL and, therefore, an easy and
affordable method for disease-related risk analysis. Patients with aggressive
histology and slow immune recovery may need additional post-transplant treatment.
