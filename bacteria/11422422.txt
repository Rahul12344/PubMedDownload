We describe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning of full-length Patr-A, -B and
-Cw locus alleles from a chimpanzee using one sense/antisense primer pair. Of the
six alleles cloned here, two have not previously been described. Comparison of
nucleotide sequences between the two novel Patr alleles and various HLA alleles
suggests that the new Patr-A allele belongs to the A1/A3/A11 family, whereas the 
new Patr-Cw allele is not closely related to any known HLA-Cw allele.
