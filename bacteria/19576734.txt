The adsorption of proteins and its buffer solution on mica surfaces was
investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Different salt concentration of
the Herbaspirillum seropedicae GlnB protein (GlnB-Hs) solution deposited on mica 
was investigated. This protein is a globular, soluble homotrimer (36kDa), member 
of PII-like proteins family involved in signal transducing in prokaryote.
Supramolecular structures were formed when this protein was deposited onto bare
mica surface. The topographic AFM images of the GlnB-Hs films showed that at high
salt concentration the supramolecular structures are spherical-like, instead of
the typical doughnut-like shape for low salt concentration. AFM images of NaCl
and Tris from the buffer solution showed structures with the same pattern as
those observed for high salt protein solution, misleading the image
interpretation. XPS experiments showed that GlnB protein film covers the mica
surface without chemical reaction.
