Bile acid diarrhoea (BAD) is a common disorder resulting from increased loss of
bile acids (BAs), overlapping irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea (IBS-D).
The gut microbiota metabolises primary BAs to secondary BAs, with differing
impacts on metabolism and homeostasis. The aim of this study was to profile the
microbiome, metabolic products and bile acids in BAD. Patients with BAD diagnosed
by SeHCAT testing, were compared with other IBS-D patients, and healthy controls.
Faecal 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis was undertaken. Faecal short chain fatty
acid (SCFA) and urinary volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured. BAs were
quantified in serum and faeces. Faecal bacterial diversity was significantly
reduced in patients with BAD. Several taxa were enriched compared to IBS-D. SCFA 
amounts differed in BAD, controls and IBS-D, with significantly more propionate
in BAD. Separation of VOC profiles was evident, but the greatest discrimination
was between IBS-D and controls. Unconjugated and primary BA in serum and faeces
were significantly higher in BAD. The faecal percentage primary BA was inversely 
related to SeHCAT. BAD produces dysbiosis, with metabolite differences, including
VOC, SCFA and primary BAs when compared to IBS-D. These findings provide new
mechanistic insights into the pathophysiology of BAD.
