Thymocyte development proceeds through two critical checkpoints that involve
signaling events through two different receptors, the TCR and the pre-TCR. These 
receptors employ two families of protein tyrosine kinases to propagate their
signals, the Src and Syk families. Genetic and biochemical evidence has shown
that the Src family kinases are critical for normal T cell maturation. ZAP-70, a 
Syk family kinase, has similarly been implicated as a critical component in
thymocyte development. Although genetic evidence has suggested that Syk is
involved during thymocyte development, a definitive study of Syk expression has
not been performed. In this paper we report our reanalysis of Syk expression in
subpopulations of murine and human thymocytes by intracellular staining and flow 
cytometry using anti-Syk mAbs. Syk is expressed at increased levels during the
stages in which pre-TCR signaling occurs. Furthermore, Syk is down-regulated
after the pre-TCR checkpoint has been passed. Syk may play an important role in
thymic development during pre-TCR signal transduction. Finally, incomplete
down-regulation of Syk expression was noted in human thymocytes, offering a
possible explanation for the distinct phenotypes of mice and humans deficient in 
ZAP-70.
