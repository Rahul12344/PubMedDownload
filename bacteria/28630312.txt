The epigenetic reader BRD4 plays a vital role in transcriptional regulation,
cellular growth control, and cell-cycle progression. Dysregulation of BRD4
function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of cancers.
However, how BRD4 is regulated to maintain its normal function in healthy cells
and how alteration of this process leads to cancer remain poorly understood. In
this study, we discovered that BRD4 is hyperphosphorylated in NUT midline
carcinoma and identified CDK9 as a potential kinase mediating BRD4
hyperphosphorylation. Disruption of BRD4 hyperphosphorylation using both chemical
and molecular inhibitors led to the repression of BRD4 downstream oncogenes and
abrogation of cellular transformation. BRD4 hyperphosphorylation is also observed
in other cancers displaying enhanced BRD4 oncogenic activity. Our study revealed 
a mechanism that may regulate BRD4 biological function through phosphorylation,
which, when dysregulated, could lead to oncogenesis. Our finding points to
strategies to target the aberrant BRD4 signaling specifically for cancer
intervention.
