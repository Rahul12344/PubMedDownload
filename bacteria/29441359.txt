Subseabed CO2 storage is considered a future climate change mitigation
technology. We investigated the ecological consequences of CO2 leakage for a
marine benthic ecosystem. For the first time with a multidisciplinary integrated 
study, we tested hypotheses derived from a meta-analysis of previous experimental
and in situ high-CO2 impact studies. For this, we compared ecological functions
of naturally CO2-vented seafloor off the Mediterranean island Panarea (Tyrrhenian
Sea, Italy) to those of nonvented sands, with a focus on biogeochemical processes
and microbial and faunal community composition. High CO2 fluxes (up to 4 to 7 mol
CO2 m-2 hour-1) dissolved all sedimentary carbonate, and comigration of silicate 
and iron led to local increases of microphytobenthos productivity (+450%) and
standing stocks (+300%). Despite the higher food availability, faunal biomass
(-80%) and trophic diversity were substantially lower compared to those at the
reference site. Bacterial communities were also structurally and functionally
affected, most notably in the composition of heterotrophs and microbial sulfate
reduction rates (-90%). The observed ecological effects of CO2 leakage on
submarine sands were reproduced with medium-term transplant experiments. This
study assesses indicators of environmental impact by CO2 leakage and finds that
community compositions and important ecological functions are permanently altered
under high CO2.
