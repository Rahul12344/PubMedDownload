Protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins are activation-suppressing
proteins for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), which
involves gene transcriptional regulation. The inhibitory mechanism of PIAS
proteins in the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway has been well studied
in mammals and Drosophila. However, the roles of PIAS in crustaceans are unclear.
In the present study, we identified PIAS in kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus 
and found that its relative expression could be induced by Vibrio anguillarum
stimulation. To explore the function of PIAS in shrimp infected with V.
anguillarum, we performed an RNA interference assay. After knockdown of PIAS
expression in shrimp subjected to V. anguillarum infection, bacterial clearance
was enhanced and the survival rate increased compared with those in the control
shrimp (dsGFP injection). Simultaneously, the expression levels of antimicrobial 
peptides (AMPs), including anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF) A1, C1, C2, and
CruI-1, increased. Further study revealed that knockdown of PIAS also enhanced
STAT phosphorylation and translocation. Pulldown assay indicated that PIAS
interacts with activated STAT in shrimp. In conclusion, PIAS negatively regulates
JAK/STAT signaling by inhibiting the phosphorylation and translocation of STAT
through the interaction between PIAS and STAT, which leads to the reduction of
AMP expression in shrimp. Our results revealed a new mechanism of PIAS-mediated
gene regulation of the STAT signal pathway.
