The biological activities of heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin (HP) are closely
related to their molecular structures. Both Pasteurella multocida heparosan
synthase 2 (PmHS2) and Escherichia coli K5 KfiA have been used for enzymatic and 
chemoenzymatic synthesis of HS and HP oligosaccharides and their derivatives. We 
show here that cloning using the pET15b vector and expressing PmHS2 as an
N-His6-tagged fusion protein improve its expression level in E. coli.
Investigation of the donor substrate specificity of the
N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activities of P. multocida heparosan synthase 2
(PmHS2) and E. coli K5 KfiA indicates the substrate promiscuities of PmHS2 and
KfiA. Overall, both PmHS2 and KfiA can use uridine
5'-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and some of its C2'- and
C6'-derivatives as donor substrates for their α1-4-GlcNAcT activities.
Nevertheless, PmHS2 has a broader tolerance towards substrate modifications.
Other than the UDP-sugars that can be used by KfiA, additional C6'-derivatives of
UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucose, and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) are tolerable
substrates for the α1-4-GlcNAcT activity of PmHS2. The substrate promiscuities of
PmHS2 and KfiA will allow efficient chemoenzymatic synthesis of diverse HS and HP
oligosaccharide derivatives which may have improved or altered activities
compared to their natural counterparts.
