755 patients were treated because of tuberculosis from 1984-1989. The treatment
was standardized according to the recommendations. INH and RMP were used in over 
95% as in the hospital as in the ambulatory phase. During the period of 6 yrs.
the use of SM was markedly reduced (21.8%) while the use of PZA increased from
14.6% to 55.0%. At least four drugs were used in 22.5%. In 36.2% mycobacteria
were found only before starting treatment. After four weeks treatment further
45.1% were negative. Adverse reactions were registered in 9.3%. Concomitant
diseases rendering the treatment were observed in 24.7%. Ten patients died
because of tuberculosis. Until now only 3 patients had relapses. Controlled
treatment is valuable and therefore recommended.
