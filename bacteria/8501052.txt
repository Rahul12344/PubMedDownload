The arsenic resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pI258 determined
lowered net cellular uptake of 73As by an active efflux mechanism. Arsenite was
exported from the cells; intracellular arsenate was first reduced to arsenite and
then transported out of the cells. Resistant cells showed lower accumulation of
73As originating from both arsenate and arsenite. Active efflux from cells loaded
with arsenite required the presence of the plasmid-determined arsB gene. Efflux
of arsenic originating as arsenate required the presence of the arsC gene and
occurred more rapidly with the addition of arsB. Inhibitor studies with S. aureus
loaded with arsenite showed that arsenite efflux was energy dependent and
appeared to be driven by the membrane potential. With cells loaded with
73AsO4(3-), a requirement for ATP for energy was observed, leading to the
conclusion that ATP was required for arsenate reduction. When the staphylococcal 
arsenic resistance determinant was cloned into Escherichia coli, lowered
accumulation of arsenate and arsenite and 73As efflux from cells loaded with
arsenate were also found. Cloning of the E. coli plasmid R773 arsA gene (the
determinant of the arsenite-dependent ATPase) in trans to the S. aureus gene arsB
resulted in increased resistance to arsenite.
