Cometabolism of DDT analogs by a Pseudomonas sp.

Francis AJ, Spanggord RJ, Ouchi GI, Bohonos N.

A Pseudomonas sp. capable of growth on several nonchlorinated and
mono-p-chloro-substituted analogs of DDT as a sole carbon source degraded
bis(p-chlorophenyl)methane and 1,1-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane only in the presence
of diphenylethane. The products p-chlorophenylacetic acid and
2-(p-chlorophenyl)-propionic acid were not further metabolized by the bacterium. 
Other chlorinated analogs of DDT were found to be recalcitrant to cometabolic
degradation with diphenylethane.
