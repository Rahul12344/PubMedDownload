Little is known as to the molecular mechanisms involved with mercury intoxication
at very low levels. Although the mechanism is not known, animal studies have
nevertheless shown that low levels of mercury may target the immune system.
Inorganic mercury (Hg2+) at very low (but non-toxic) levels can disrupt immune
system homeostasis, in that genetically susceptible rodents develop idiosyncratic
autoimmune disease, which is associated with defective T-cell function. T
lymphocyte function is intimately coupled to the T-cell receptor. We have
previously reported that on a molecular level, low concentrations of Hg2+ disrupt
signaling from the T-cell receptor by interfering with activation of Ras and ERK 
MAP kinase. In this report we expand upon those results by showing that in T
lymphocytes exposed to low concentration of Hg2+, Ras fails to become properly
activated because upstream of Ras in the T cell signal transduction pathway, the 
important scaffolding element Linker for Activation of T Cells (LAT) fails to
become properly phosphorylated. Hypo-phosphorylation of LAT occurs, because
upstream of LAT, the LAT reactive tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 is also not properly
activated in Hg2+ treated cells.
