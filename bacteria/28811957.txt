Oncogenic "driver" mutations are theoretically attractive targets for the
immunotherapy of lymphoid cancers, yet the proportion that can be recognized by T
cells remains poorly defined. To address this issue without any confounding
effects of the patient's immune system, we assessed T cells from 19 healthy
donors for recognition of three common driver mutations in lymphoma: MYD88L265P, 
EZH2Y641F , and EZH2Y641N . Donors collectively expressed the 10 most prevalent
HLA class I alleles, including HLA-A*02:01. Peripheral blood T cells were primed 
with peptide-loaded dendritic cells (DC), and reactive T cells were assessed for 
recognition of naturally processed mutant versus wild type full-length proteins. 
After screening three driver mutations across 17-26 HLA class I alleles and 3 ×
106-3 × 107 T cells per donor, we identified CD4+ T cells against EFISENCGEII
from EZH2Y641N (presented by HLA-DRB1*13:02) and CD8+ T cells against RPIPIKYKA
from MYD88L265P (presented by HLA-B*07:02). We failed to detect
RPIPIKYKA-specific T cells in seven other HLA-B*07:02-positive donors, including 
two lymphoma patients. Thus, healthy donors harbor T cells specific for common
driver mutations in lymphoma. However, such responses appear to be rare due to
the combined limitations of antigen processing, HLA restriction, and T cell
repertoire size, highlighting the need for highly individualized approaches for
selecting targets.
