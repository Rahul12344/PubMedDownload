Interleukin-10 (IL-10)-producing B cells (B10 cells) play a critical role in the 
immune system balance by negatively regulating inflammatory responses. This study
was conducted to determine the effect of local B10 cell induction on periodontal 
inflammation and bone loss in ligature-induced experimental periodontitis in vivo
Purified spleen B cells from C57BL/6J mice (8 to 10 weeks old) were cultured with
CD40 ligand (CD40L) and the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist
cytidine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) to determine effective
IL-10 induction in vitro Silk ligatures (size 7-0) were tied around the mouse
maxillary second molars on day 0, followed by the injection of CD40L and CpG into
the palatal gingiva on days 3, 6, and 9. All the mice were sacrificed, and
samples were collected on day 14. CD40L and CpG significantly increased the level
of IL-10 production by B cells in vitro, although the frequencies of CD1dhi CD5+ 
and IL-10-producing (IL-10+) CD45+ cells were decreased. IL-10 was predominantly 
produced by the CD1dhi CD5+ subpopulation of B cells. In vivo, both IL-10 mRNA
expression and the number of IL-10+ CD45+ cells were significantly increased
after gingival injection of CD40L and CpG. Periodontal bone loss was
significantly decreased and the gingival expression of IL-1β, tumor necrosis
factor alpha, and RANKL was significantly reduced. The number of multinucleated
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells along the alveolar bone
surface was significantly decreased after gingival injection of CD40L and CpG.
This study indicates for the first time that the local induction of B10 cell
activity could inhibit periodontal inflammation and bone loss.
