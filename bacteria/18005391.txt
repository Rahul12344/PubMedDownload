Many strains of Vibrio cholerae produce a cytolysin (VCC) that forms oligomeric
transmembrane pores responsible for vacuolization of several cell types in
culture. Here we suggest that VCC could contribute to the T helper 2 (Th2)
response seen in the natural infection; acting through TLR2, VCC enhances mast
cells secretion of IL-4, IL-6 and TNF-alpha by 330-, 290- and 550-fold
respectively. Moreover, VCC-induced cytokine production is dependent on increased
cytosolic Ca(2+) and on the presence of the Src family kinases Lyn and Fyn, known
to be required for FcepsilonRI-dependent activation of mast cells. These findings
strongly suggest that VCC has a pro-inflammatory activity promoting a Th2-type
immune profile.
