The CD1 system is composed of five types of human CD1 proteins, CD1a, CD1b, CD1c,
CD1d, and CD1e, and their mammalian orthologs. Each type of CD1 protein has a
distinct antigen binding groove and shows differing patterns of expression within
cells and in different tissues. Here we review the molecular mechanisms by which 
CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c capture distinct classes of self- and mycobacterial
antigens. We discuss how CD1-restricted T cells participate in the immune
response, emphasizing new evidence for mycobacterial recognition in vivo in human
and non-human models.
