Flagellar type III secretion systems (T3SS) contain an essential cytoplasmic-ring
(C-ring) largely composed of two proteins FliM and FliN, whereas an analogous
substructure for the closely related non-flagellar (NF) T3SS has not been
observed in situ. We show that the spa33 gene encoding the putative NF-T3SS
C-ring component in Shigella flexneri is alternatively translated to produce both
full-length (Spa33-FL) and a short variant (Spa33-C), with both required for
secretion. They associate in a 1:2 complex (Spa33-FL/C2) that further
oligomerises into elongated arrays in vitro. The structure of Spa33-C2 and
identification of an unexpected intramolecular pseudodimer in Spa33-FL reveal a
molecular model for their higher order assembly within NF-T3SS. Spa33-FL and
Spa33-C are identified as functional counterparts of a FliM-FliN fusion and free 
FliN respectively. Furthermore, we show that Thermotoga maritima FliM and FliN
form a 1:3 complex structurally equivalent to Spa33-FL/C2 , allowing us to
propose a unified model for C-ring assembly by NF-T3SS and flagellar-T3SS.
