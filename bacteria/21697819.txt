BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on
metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt NY-YP901 (Namyang Dairy Product Co. Ltd
and Nutra R&BT Inc., Seoul, Korea) supplemented with mixture of Streptococcus
thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis and
extra-ingredients containing Bifidobacterium breve (CBG-C2), Enterococcus
faecalis FK-23, fibersol-2 and so on.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel study. Treatment and control groups consumed a
functional yogurt NY-YP901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day,
respectively, for 8 weeks. Body weight and body mass index (BMI), blood pressure,
lipid profiles, fasting glucose with HbA1C and waist circumference were measured 
before and after treatment. Inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between
the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent.
RESULTS: During the period August 2009 to December 2009, 101 healthy participants
(31 males and 70 females) finished the study. Treatment group were 53
individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. In the treatment group
consuming NY-YP901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in
body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24±1.50 vs +0.64±1.39 kg,
P<0.05), BMI (-0.10±0.58 vs +0.24±0.50 kg/m(2), P<0.05 ) and low-density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (-7.71±14.14 vs -0.43±15.32 mg/dl, P<0.05) after 8 
weeks. The change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and
the control groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The functional yogurt NY-YP901 reduced LDL-cholesterol, body weight 
and BMI in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. From these
findings, regular intake of functional yogurt NY-YP901 may be consequently
related to improve metabolic syndrome.
