Environmental insults, such as exposure to pathogens, modulate the behavioural
coping style of animals to stressors, and repeated exposure to stressful
environments may lead to species-specific infection phenotypes. To analyse the
influence of stress behavioural phenotypes on immune and metabolic performance,
gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) were first screened for proactive and
reactive coping styles. Once characterized, both behavioural phenotypes fish
groups were bath vaccinated with bacterin from Vibrio anguillarum, an
opportunistic widespread pathogen of fish. Gills and liver were sampled at 0
(control group), 1, 3 and 7 days post-vaccination. Immune-, oxidative stress- and
metabolic-related transcripts (il1β, tnfα, igm, gpx1, sod, cat, lpl, ghr1 and
ghr2), metabolic endpoints (glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides), hepatic
health indicators (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase and alkaline 
phosphatase), oxidative stress status (esterase activity, total antioxidant
capacity and total oxidative status) and stress biomarkers (cortisol) were
determined. Present results indicate that screening for coping styles in the
gilthead sea bream segregated the two distinct phenotypes as expected: proactive 
and reactive. Results also indicate that under bath vaccination proactive fish
show high immune response and lower metabolism, whereas reactive fish show low
immune and higher metabolic responses.
