Transcriptional activity from a specified promoter can provide a useful marker
for the physiological state of a cell. Here we introduce a method for selective
tagging of proteins made in cells in which specified promoters are active. Tagged
proteins can be modified with affinity reagents for enrichment or with
fluorescent dyes for visualization. The method allows state-selective analysis of
the proteome, whereby proteins synthesized in predetermined physiological states 
can be identified. The approach is demonstrated by proteome-wide labeling of
bacterial proteins upon activation of the P(BAD) promoter and the SoxRS regulon
and provides a basis for analysis of more complex systems including spatially
heterogeneous microbial cultures and biofilms.
