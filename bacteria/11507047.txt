The lack of a sensitive immunoassay for quantitating serum prostate-specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) hinders its clinical utility as a diagnostic/prognostic
biomarker. An innovative protein biochip immunoassay was used to quantitate and
compare serum PSMA levels in healthy men and patients with either benign or
malignant prostate disease. PSMA was captured from serum by anti-PSMA antibody
bound to ProteinChip arrays, the captured PSMA detected by surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and quantitated by comparing the mass
signal integrals to a standard curve established using purified recombinant PSMA.
The average serum PSMA value for prostate cancer (623.1 ng/ml) was significantly 
different (P < 0.001) from that for benign prostate hyperplasia (117.1 ng/ml) and
the normal groups (age <50, 272.9 ng/ml; age >50, 359.4 ng/ml). These initial
results suggest that serum PSMA may be a more effective biomarker than
prostate-specific antigen for differentiating benign from malignant prostate
disease and warrants additional evaluation of the surface-enhanced laser
desorption/ionization PSMA immunoassay to determine its diagnostic utility.
