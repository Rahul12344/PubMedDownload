The trophic importance of bacterioplankton as a source of carbon and sulfur
nutrition for consumers in meromictic lakes was tested using stable carbon (delta
13C) and sulfur (delta 34S) isotopic measurements. Studies in three lakes near
Syracuse, New York, showed that most consumers ultimately derive their C and S
nutrition from a mixture of terrestrial detritus, phytoplankton, and littoral
vegetation, rather than from bacterioplankton. Food webs in these meromictic
lakes are thus similar to those in other lakes that lack dense populations of
bacterioplankton.
