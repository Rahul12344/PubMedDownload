Knowledge of the architecture of DNA ligase IV (LigIV) and interactions with
XRCC4 and XLF-Cernunnos is necessary for understanding its role in the ligation
of double-strand breaks during nonhomologous end joining. Here we report the
structure of a subdomain of the nucleotidyltrasferase domain of human LigIV and
provide insights into the residues associated with LIG4 syndrome. We use this
structural information together with the known structures of the BRCT/XRCC4
complex and those of LigIV orthologs to interpret small-angle X-ray scattering of
LigIV in complex with XRCC4 and size exclusion chromatography of LigIV, XRCC4,
and XLF-Cernunnos. Our results suggest that the flexibility of the catalytic
region is limited in a manner that affects the formation of the
LigIV/XRCC4/XLF-Cernunnos complex.
