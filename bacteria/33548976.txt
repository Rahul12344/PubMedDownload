Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting the skin and joints, IL- 17
family has been shown to be the major effector cytokine in its pathogenesis. This
study aimed to investigate genetic polymorphism of IL-17F (rs763780) and evaluate
the impact of this polymorphism on circulating levels of IL-17F as a potential
risk locus for psoriasis. 60 patients suffering from chronic plaque psoriasis and
60 healthy controls were genotyped for the IL-17F (rs763780) using an
Amplification Refractory Mutation System -PCR (ARMS-PCR) method. Measurement of
serum IL-17F was also done by ELISA. There was a significant difference in
frequency between TT and TC genotypes (OR= 2.74, 95%CI=1.04 -7.4, P=0.04) and TT 
and CC genotypes (OR=10.9, 95%CI=1.3-91.3, P=0.007). Moreover, the TC and CC
genotypes were associated with increased risk of psoriasis in comparison with the
TT genotype. (OR= 3.8, 95% CI: 1.5- 9.4, P= 0.003). The mutant allele, C, was
significantly associated with an increased risk of psoriasis compared to that
with the wild T allele, T (OR= 4.1, 95% CI: 1.9- 9.1, P= 0.0002). Serum level of 
IL-17F was higher among psoriasis patients (‎25.7±3.8pg/ml) than healthy controls
((15.1±2.1‎‎pg/ mL). In conclusion, IL17F polymorphism (rs763780) is associated
with increased risk of psoriasis and may influence the level of production of
IL-17F with subsequent effects on the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
