DNA helicase B is a major DNA helicase in mouse FM3A cells. A
temperature-sensitive mutant defective in DNA replication, tsFT848, isolated from
FM3A cells, has a heat-labile DNA helicase B. In this study, we purified DNA
helicase B from mouse FM3A cells and determined partial amino acid sequences of
the purified protein. By using a DNA probe synthesized according to one of the
partial amino acid sequences, a cDNA was isolated, which encoded a 121.5 kDa
protein containing seven conserved motifs for DNA/RNA helicase superfamily
members. A database search revealed similarity between DNA helicase B and the
alpha subunit of exodeoxyribonuclease V of a number of prokaryotes including
Escherichia coli RecD protein, but no homologous protein was found in yeast. The 
cDNA encoding DNA helicase B from tsFT848 was sequenced and a mutation was found 
between DNA/RNA helicase motifs IV and V.
