To assess the ability of proteins of the thrombospondin family to inhibit
angiogenesis, recombinant murine thrombospondin-2, bovine thrombospondin-2/CISP
and thrombospondin-5/COMP were purified and tested for ability to block the
migration of capillary endothelial cells towards a variety of inducers and to
inhibit neovascularization induced in the rat cornea. Both preparations of
thrombospondin-2 were active inhibitors in vitro and in vivo whereas
thrombospondin-5/COMP was inactive. These results define thrombospondin-2 as a
newly identified naturally occurring inhibitor of angiogenesis and suggest that
the properdin-like type 1 modules that it shares with antiangiogenic
thrombospondin-1 and are missing in thrombospondin-5/COMP could contribute to
this activity.
