Elucidation of the identity and diversity of mechanisms that sustain long-term
human blood cell production remains an important challenge. Previous studies
indicate that, in adult mice, this property is vested in cells identified
uniquely by their ability to clonally regenerate detectable, albeit highly
variable levels and types, of mature blood cells in serially transplanted
recipients. From a multi-parameter analysis of the molecular features of very
primitive human cord blood cells that display long-term cell outputs in vitro and
in immunodeficient mice, we identified a prospectively separable
CD33+CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+CD49f+ phenotype with serially transplantable, but
diverse, cell output profiles. Single-cell measurements of the mitogenic
response, and the transcriptional, DNA methylation and 40-protein content of this
and closely related phenotypes revealed subtle but consistent differences both
within and between each subset. These results suggest that multiple regulatory
mechanisms combine to maintain different cell output activities of human blood
cell precursors with high regenerative potential.
