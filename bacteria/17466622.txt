Translational accuracy and efficiency depend upon modification of uridines in the
tRNA anticodon stem loop (ASL) by a highly conserved pseudouridine synthase TruA.
TruA specifically modifies uridines at positions 38, 39, and/or 40 of tRNAs with 
highly divergent sequences and structures through a poorly characterized
mechanism that differs from previously studied RNA-modifying enzymes. The
molecular basis for the site and substrate "promiscuity" was studied by
determining the crystal structures of E. coli TruA in complex with two different 
leucyl tRNAs in conjunction with functional assays and computer simulation. The
structures capture three stages of the TruA*tRNA reaction, revealing the
mechanism by which TruA selects the target site. We propose that TruA utilizes
the intrinsic flexibility of the ASL for site promiscuity and also to select
against intrinsically stable tRNAs to avoid their overstabilization through
pseudouridylation, thereby maintaining the balance between the flexibility and
stability required for its biological function.
