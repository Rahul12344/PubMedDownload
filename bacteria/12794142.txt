Pulmonary eosinophilia induced in C57BL/6 mice after Cryptococcus neoformans
infection is driven by CD4(+) Th2 cells. The immunological mechanisms that
protect against eosinophilia are not fully understood. Interaction of OX40
(CD134) and its ligand, OX40L, has been implicated in T cell activation and cell 
migration. Unlike CD28, OX40 is only expressed on T cells 1-2 days after Ag
activation. Manipulation of this pathway would therefore target recently
activated T cells, leaving the naive repertoire unaffected. In this study, we
show that engagement of OX40 by an OX40L:Ig fusion protein drives IFN-gamma
production by CD4(+) T cells and reduces eosinophilia and C. neoformans burden in
the lung. Using gene-depleted mice, we show that reduction of eosinophilia and
pathogen burden requires IL-12 and/or IFN-gamma. C. neoformans infection itself
only partially induces OX40L expression by APCs. Provision of exogenous OX40L
reveals a critical role of this pathway in the prevention of C.
neoformans-induced eosinophilia.
