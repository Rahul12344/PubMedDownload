INTRODUCTION: Although bacterial infection and heat stress are common causes of
injury in human dental pulp cells (HDPCs), little is known about the potential
defense mechanisms mediating their effects. This study examined the role of SIRT1
in mediating heat stress and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune and defense 
gene expression in HDPCs.
METHODS: HDPCs were exposed to heat stress (42°C) for 30 minutes after
stimulation with LPS (1 μg/mL) for 48 hours. The expression of defense genes was 
evaluated by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting,
and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: LPS and heat stress synergistically increased the expression of SIRT1
and immune and defense genes such as interleukin (IL)-8, hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), 
and human β-defensin 2 (hBD-2). Resveratrol enhanced LPS- and heat stress-induced
expression of HO-1 and hBD-2 but reduced IL-8 messenger RNA levels. The
stimulation of HO-1 and hBD-2 messenger RNA expression by LPS and heat stress was
inhibited by sirtinol; SIRT1 small interfering RNA; and inhibitors of p38, ERK,
JNK, and nuclear factor κB.
CONCLUSIONS: These results show for the first time that SIRT1 mediates the
induction of immune and defense gene expression in HDPCs by LPS and heat stress. 
SIRT1 may play a pivotal role in host immune defense system in HDPCS.
