While erythropoietin (EPO) constitutes the major treatment for anemia, a range of
anemic disorders remain resistant to EPO treatment. The need for alternative
therapeutic strategies requires the identification of mechanisms that
physiologically restrain erythropoiesis. Here we show that P38α restrains
erythropoiesis in mouse and human erythroblasts independently of EPO by
integrating apoptotic signals during recovery from anemia. P38α deficiency
promotes JNK activation through increased expression of Map3k4 via a negative
feedback mechanism. JNK prevents Cdk1-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation by Smurf2 of the epigenetic silencer Ezh2. Stabilized Ezh2 silences
Bim expression and protects erythroblasts from apoptosis. Thus, we identify
P38α/JNK signaling as a molecular brake modulating erythropoiesis through
epigenetic silencing of Bim. We propose that inhibition of P38α, by enhancing
erythropoiesis in an EPO-independent fashion, may provide an alternative strategy
for the treatment of anemia.
