This study investigated the role of autophagy in the survival of the invasive
bacterium Brucella melitensis strain 16M in murine macrophages. Here, Brucella
melitensis 16M was found to trigger autophagosome formation, enhance autophagy
flux and increase the expression level of the autophagy marker protein LC3-II.
When autophagy was pharmacologically inhibited by 3-methyladenine (3-MA),
Brucella replication efficiency was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). These
results suggest that autophagy favors Brucella melitensis 16M survival in murine 
macrophages.
