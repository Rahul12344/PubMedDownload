Some aspects of microbial contamination of hands of workers in food industries.

de Wit JC, Kampelmacher EH.

With regard to food hygiene, the question is posed whether carriers of pathogenic
organisms, like Salmonella can contaminate a product by their hands. This might
especially be possible in case of bad toilet hygiene. Experiments were carried
out in 13 food and 3 non-food establishments. An inquiry was made into habits of 
toilet use and hand washing. The following microbiological examinations were
performed on workers' hands: total colony-forming-units per hand, and the
presence of Salmonella, E. coli, Enterobact., Staph. aureus, faecal Streptococci 
and Cl. perfringens. Approximately 42% of workers in the food industry and
approximately 64% of workers in other industries seems to use the factory toilet 
regularly for defaecation. Because of the presence of contaminated raw materials 
in food industries, it is impossible to get direct proof that faecal
contamination of the hands is due to toilet use. However, there is indirect
evidence that contamination of workers' hands by raw materials, especially of
animal origin, is of much more importance than the consequences of toilet use.
This is shown by the occurrence of Salmonella on the hands (5-36% pos.) in only
those factories where raw materials of animal origin are handled, by the low
incidence of E. coli on the hands in food industries where "clean" materials
(vegetables, biscuits, chocolate) are handled, and by the total absence of E.
coli on the hands of workers in two non-food industries.
