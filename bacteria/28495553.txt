Over the last decade, a new understanding of tumor-immune system interplay has
been ushered in, lead in large part by the discovery of immune checkpoints
mediated through B7-CD28 family interactions. Therapeutic blockade of the PD-L1
immune checkpoint pathway has already shown great success as a cancer
immunotherapy for advanced urothelial carcinoma, leading to durable clinical
remissions in an otherwise incurable disease. There are newly described members
of the B7-CD28 family including B7-H3, B7x, and HHLA2. These ligands are thought 
to play an essential role in suppressing T-cell response, leading to immune
tolerance of tumors. This feature makes them attractive targets for novel
immunotherapy treatment paradigms. Here, we review the literature of current
strategies and future directions of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for
bladder cancer.
