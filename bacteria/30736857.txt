BACKGROUND: The success of agents that reverse T-cell inhibitory signals, such as
anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies, has reinvigorated cancer immunotherapy research.
However, since only a minority of patients respond to single-agent therapies,
methods to test the potential anti-tumor activity of rational combination
therapies are still needed. Conventional murine xenograft models have been
hampered by their immune-compromised status; thus, we developed a hematopoietic
humanized mouse model, hu-CB-BRGS, and used it to study anti-tumor human immune
responses to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line and patient-derived
colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts (PDX).
METHODS: BALB/c-Rag2nullIl2rγnullSIRPαNOD (BRGS) pups were humanized through
transplantation of cord blood (CB)-derived CD34+ cells. Mice were evaluated for
human chimerism in the blood and assigned into experimental untreated or
nivolumab groups based on chimerism. TNBC cell lines or tumor tissue from
established CRC PDX models were implanted into both flanks of humanized mice and 
treatments ensued once tumors reached a volume of ~150mm3. Tumors were measured
twice weekly. At end of study, immune organs and tumors were collected for
immunological assessment.
RESULTS: Humanized PDX models were successfully established with a high frequency
of tumor engraftment. Humanized mice treated with anti-PD-1 exhibited increased
anti-tumor human T-cell responses coupled with decreased Treg and myeloid
populations that correlated with tumor growth inhibition. Combination therapies
with anti-PD-1 treatment in TNBC-bearing mice reduced tumor growth in multi-drug 
cohorts. Finally, as observed in human colorectal patients, anti-PD-1 therapy had
a strong response to a microsatellite-high CRC PDX that correlated with a higher 
number of human CD8+ IFNγ+ T cells in the tumor.
CONCLUSION: Hu-CB-BRGS mice represent an in vivo model to study immune checkpoint
blockade to human tumors. The human immune system in the mice is inherently
suppressed, similar to a tumor microenvironment, and thus allows growth of human 
tumors. However, the suppression can be released by anti-PD-1 therapies and
inhibit tumor growth of some tumors. The model offers ample access to lymph and
tumor cells for in-depth immunological analysis. The tumor growth inhibition
correlates with increased CD8 IFNγ+ tumor infiltrating T cells. These hu-CB-BRGS 
mice provide a relevant preclinical animal model to facilitate prioritization of 
hypothesis-driven combination immunotherapies.
