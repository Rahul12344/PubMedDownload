BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) is a treatment
approach in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. The options for mobilization of 
CD34+ cells to support high-dose therapy are granulocyte-colony stimulating
factors (G-CSFs) alone or after chemotherapy. Limited data exist on the efficacy 
of lipegfilgrastim (LIPEG) in the mobilization field.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present prospective nonrandomized study compared LIPEG 
6 mg (n = 40) with pegfilgrastim (PEG) 6 mg (n = 37) in the mobilization of blood
CD34+ cells after chemotherapy in NHL patients with comparable mobilizing
chemotherapy and disease status before auto-SCT.
RESULTS: Significantly higher blood CD34+ cell (B-CD34+ ) counts were observed in
the LIPEG group at the start of the first apheresis (44 vs 23 × 106 /L, P =
.009), in line with a higher collection yield of the first apheresis (3.3 vs
2.1 × 106 /kg, P = .086) and total yield of CD34+ cells (4.7 vs 2.9 × 106 /kg, P 
= .004). LIPEG proved to be a more effective G-CSF, resulting in a higher B-CD34+
cell peak (60 vs 32 × 106 /L, P = .030) and higher proportion of excellent
mobilizers (33% vs 8%, P = .008). The superiority of LIPEG was confirmed in the
multivarite analysis concerning the CD34+ cell yield of the first apheresis day
(P = .010) and the total yield (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: The mobilization of blood grafts with LIPEG added to chemotherapy was
associated with higher CD34+ cell apheresis yields than with PEG. A randomized
study is warranted to verify these findings.
