Snail is a master inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
metastasis, however, Snail protein is labile and is quickly degraded through the 
predominate ubiquitination-mediated proteasome pathway. Deubiquitinases (DUBs)
can counteract the Snail degradation process to maintain high level of Snail
protein in cancer cells. In this study, we screened a cDNA library containing 79 
DUBs, and discovered that a panel of DUBs consisting of USP13, USP28, USP29,
USP37, OTUD6A, and DUB3 can markedly stabilize Snail protein, with USP29
displaying the strongest activity to prevent Snail degradation. Mechanistically, 
USP29 enhances the interaction of Snail and SCP1, resulting in simultaneous
dephosphorylation and deubiquitination of Snail and thereafter cooperative
prevention of Snail degradation. Biologically, ectopic expression of USP29
promotes gastric cancer cell migration, and depletion of Snail abolishes
USP29-mediated cell migration; and USP29 can be induced by major EMT and
metastatic inducing factors such as TGFβ, TNFα, and hypoxia. More importantly,
high expression levels of Snail, USP29, and SCP1 are associated with poor
survival and prognosis. Collectively, these data indicate that Snail is a crucial
substrate for USP29 to promote cell migration and USP29/SCP1 complex may be new
therapeutic targets to treat metastatic cancer.
