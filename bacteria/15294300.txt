In this work, we present the production of an active 43 aa recombinant human
beta-defensin-1 (rhBD-1(43)) in Escherichia coli AD202 cells using specific
pLMM1-rhBD-1 expression system. Unique solubility properties of the C-terminal
fragment of light meromyosin (LMM) allowed us to overcome foreseeable problems
with isolation procedures and toxicity caused by rhBD-1 to the host organism. As 
a result, the majority of fusion protein (LMM-rhBD-1(43)) was obtained in the
soluble state, isolated by a low salt-high salt treatment of total cell protein. 
The rhBD-1(43) was cleaved from the fusion with Protease 4 and purified on CM
Sepharose Fast Flow column with the yield of approximately 1 mg rhBD-1(43) from 6
g of wet weight cells. Purified rhBD-1(43) showed antimicrobial activity against 
E. coli ML-35p at a concentration of 129 microM. The procedure of rhBD-1
expression and purification we present can provide a reliable and simple method
for production of different cationic peptides for biological studies.
