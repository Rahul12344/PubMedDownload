Signals induced by the TCR and CD28 costimulatory pathway have been shown to lead
to the inactivation of the constitutively active enzyme, glycogen synthase
kinase-3 (GSK3), which has been implicated in the regulation of IL-2 and T cell
proliferation. However, it is unknown whether GSK3 plays a similar role in naive 
and memory CD4(+) T cell responses. Here we demonstrate a divergence in the
dependency on the inactivation of GSK3 in the proliferative responses of human
naive and memory CD4(+) T cells. We find that although CD28 costimulation
increases the frequency of phospho-GSK3 inactivation in TCR-stimulated naive and 
memory CD4(+) T cells, memory cells are less reliant on GSK3 inactivation for
their proliferative responses. Rather we find that GSK3beta plays a previously
unrecognized role in the selective regulation of the IL-10 recall response by
human memory CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, GSK3beta-inactivated memory CD4(+) T
cells acquired the capacity to suppress the bystander proliferation of CD4(+) T
cells in an IL-10-dependent, cell contact-independent manner. Our findings reveal
a dichotomy present in the function of GSK3 in distinct human CD4(+) T cell
populations.
