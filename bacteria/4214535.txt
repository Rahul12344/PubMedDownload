Myo-Inositol dehydrogenase(s) from Acetomonas oxydans. Optimization of conditions
for solubilization of membrane-bound enzyme.

Criddle WJ, Fry JC, Keaney MM.

Methods are described for the first reported successful isolation of the soluble 
form of the membrane-bound myo-inositol dehydrogenase(s) from Acetomonas oxydans.
Conditions for optimum yields of active enzyme in a crude membrane-free protein
extract were established. The relevant conditions are (a) cell rupture by
solid-shearing, (b) solubilization of the complete 60000g pellet with sodium
deoxycholate at pH7.2, (c) rapid separation of the released protein from sodium
deoxycholate by gel chromatography.
