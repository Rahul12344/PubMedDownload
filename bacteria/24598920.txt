Pectin methylesterase removes the methyl groups from the main chain of pectin,
the major component of the middle lamella of the plant cell wall. The enzyme is
involved in plant cell-wall development, is part of the enzymatic arsenal used by
microorganisms to attack plants and also has a wide range of applications in the 
industrial sector. Therefore, there is a considerable interest in studies of the 
structure and function of this enzyme. In this work, the pectin methylesterase
from Sphenophorus levis was produced in Pichia pastoris and purified. Crystals
belonging to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a =
122.181, b = 82.213, c = 41.176 Å, β = 97.48°, were obtained by the sitting-drop 
vapour-diffusion method and an X-ray diffraction data set was collected to 2.1 Å 
resolution. Structure refinement and model building are in progress.
