The degradation of parathion and DDT in aqueous systems containing organic
additives.

Sharom MS, Miles JR.

Laboratory studies were conducted to investigate some of the factors influencing 
pesticide degradation in aqueous systems. parathion added to natural water in
ethanol, acetone or without organic solvent, was completely degraded within 2 wk.
While most of the parathion was reduced to amino-parathion when added in ethanol,
no amino-parathion was detected in the presence of acetone or when no solvent was
added, suggesting that in the latter two cases the insecticide was aerobically
degraded to other metabolites. No paraoxon was detected. When ethanol
concentration was increased from 1% to 2 and 4%, the rate of parathion
degradation was inversely related to the ethanol concentration. In the presence
of glucose as a carbon source, approximately 50% of the parathion was reduced to 
aminoparathion. DDT degradation in natural water was more rapid when it was added
in ethanol than when added in acetone. The only DDT metabolite detected was TDE, 
with about 36% conversion in presence of ethanol, and 20% when the DDT was added 
in acetone.
