BACKGROUND: Balanced levels of proteases and anti-proteases are essential in host
defense systems. In CF patients' lungs, elevated protease/anti-protease-ratios
contribute to damage of airway tissue and premature death with the inherited
disease. Little is known about upper airway protease equilibrium in CF.
METHODS: Neutrophil elastase (NE), Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI),
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)1, 
cathepsin S (CTSS) and the corresponding cellular distribution were assessed in
the nasal lavage (NL) and sputum of 40 CF patients.
RESULTS: Concentrations of all proteases and anti-proteases were markedly higher 
in sputum than in NL (NE: 10-fold, SLPI: 5000-fold). Interestingly, the NE/SLPI
ratio was 726-fold higher in NL compared to sputum, while the MMP9/TIMP1 ratio
was 4.5-fold higher in sputum compared to NL.
DISCUSSION: This first study to compare protease/anti-protease networks of CF
upper and lower airways by NL and sputum reveals substantial differences between 
both compartments' immunological responses. This finding may have implications
for sinonasal and pulmonary treatment, possibly leading to new therapeutic
approaches.
