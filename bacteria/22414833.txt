INTRODUCTION: Lymphocytes, among many cells, express different sets of cytokines,
chemokines, and receptors, which are considered important mediators of periapical
immune response to infection.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the mRNA expression of
CD4(+)CD28(+) and CD8(+) T genes and the gene expression of interferon-γ, tumor
necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17A, IL-10, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL4, CCL5,
CXCR4, CCR5, and receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) in 
periapical interstitial fluid from human root canal infections. The samples were 
collected immediately after root canal cleaning and 7 days later (restrained root
canal bacterial load) to characterize those gene expressions.
RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated significantly higher
levels of CD4(+)CD28(+) and CD8(+) T-cell markers in the former root canal
condition and an increase of IL-10 and CXCR4, followed by a decrease of
proinflammatory cytokines such as RANKL, interferon-γ, IL-1β, and CCL5.
CONCLUSIONS: Analyses of T-lymphocyte and cytokine expression in periapical area 
were able to show that distinct root canal conditions might play regulatory roles
in controlling local immune/inflammatory processes.
