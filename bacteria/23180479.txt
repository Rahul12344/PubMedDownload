As a superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) has commonly been used as
an antitumour immunotherapy agent in China. However, the clinical application of 
SEC2 has been hampered by its pyrogenic toxicity and the presence of neutralizing
antibody in patients. Thus, an improvement in its superantigen-based
immunotherapy is highly needed. In this study, a truncated SEC2 mutant,
SEC(14-128), was constructed without the N-terminal 13 and C-terminal 111 aa.
This mutant retained T-cell proliferation and antitumour activities in in vitro
experiments. However, it induced a significantly decreased release of the main
inflammatory cytokines inerleukin-2 and gamma interferon. Moreover, SEC(14-128)
exhibited reduced toxicity and affinity to anti-SEC2 IgG compared with native
SEC2. Based on the considerable antitumour activity and low toxicity, it is
proposed that the mutant SEC(14-128) could be a potential candidate for cancer
treatment.
