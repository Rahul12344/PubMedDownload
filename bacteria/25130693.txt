With antibiotic resistance mechanisms increasing in diversity and spreading among
bacterial pathogens, the development of new classes of antibacterial agents
against judiciously chosen targets is a high-priority task. The biochemical
pathway for peptidoglycan biosynthesis is one of the best sources of
antibacterial targets. Within this pathway are the Mur ligases, described in this
review as highly suitable targets for the development of new classes of
antibacterial agents. The amide ligases MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF function with
the same catalytic mechanism and share conserved amino acid regions and
structural features that can conceivably be exploited for the design of
inhibitors that simultaneously target more than one enzyme. This would provide
multi-target antibacterial weapons with minimized likelihood of target-mediated
resistance development.
