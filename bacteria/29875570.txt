Background: Effective management of smear layer ensures adequate clinical
success. Use of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
regimen has been the gold standard with limitations. Commercial irrigants
incorporate surface modifiers to address these drawbacks. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of combination regimens on target and nontarget 
cell lines by trypan blue assay.
Materials and Methods: Nonsurfactant combination regimen of chlorhexidine (CHX)
and NaOCl (2% CHX + 2.5% NaOCl) and surfactant regimens of CHX with cetrimide
(CTR) (2% CHX + 0.5% CTR) and CHX with sodium dodecyl sulfate (2% CHX + 1% SDS)
were prepared. 0.9% normal saline (NS) and Biopure MTAD (100%) served as control.
Cytotoxicity was evaluated on human gingival fibroblast (HGF) and Henrietta Lacks
(HeLa) cell lines by trypan blue assay. Thirty microliter of the cell suspension 
was treated with 20 Î¼l of irrigants. The cell suspension was loaded into Neubauer
chamber after 5 min and cell count was performed under inverted microscope and
expressed as viability percentage.
Results: Nonsurfactant combination comprising of 2% CHX + 2.5% NaOCl formed a
brownish precipitate while surfactant combination regimes were stable without any
precipitate formation. NS and 2% CHX + 0.5% CTR had greater viability scores on
both cell lines. Two percent CHX + 1% SDS had better viability on HeLa but were
severely cytotoxic on HGF. Two percent CHX + 2.5% NaOCl and MTAD were found to be
severely cytotoxic on HeLa with limited viability on HGF.
Conclusion: The variation in data obtained could be possibly attributed to the
difference in the cellular membrane composition and mechanism of action of
combination regimens. Experimental surfactant regimen 2% CHX + 0.5% CTR shows
lower cytotoxicity than MTAD.
