We report a 44-year-old patient with refractory acute myeloid leukemia who
developed a rare form of disseminated cutaneous aspergillosis resulting from
colonization in the deep reticular dermis of Aspergillus flavus. Diagnosis was
based on cutaneous biopsy. Antifungal therapy was started with liposomal
amphotericin B (L AmB). However, the lesions continued to spread and there was a 
marked decline in the patient's clinical condition. Consequently, L AmB was
replaced with voriconazole. Response to voriconazole was excellent with
regression of the skin lesions and a rapid improvement of the patient's general
clinical condition.
