Pasteurella multocida is the commonest cause of local infection after an animal
bite, but is an unusual cause of meningitis. We report a case of P. multocida
meningitis occurring in a 7-week-old infant which was contracted after
non-traumatic contact with a household pet, that is, without any animal bite or
scratch. The organism may be easily confused with more common Gram-negative
pathogens. In this case, it was initially incorrectly diagnosed as Haemophilus
influenzae type b (Hib); a possibility which has important implications in the
era of routine use of Hib vaccine in infant immunisation programs.CONCLUSION:
Pasteurella multocida is an unusual, but serious cause of meningitis in infancy. 
It is potentially preventable by the avoidance of contact between young infants
and the saliva of household pets, in particular by assiduous hand hygiene.
