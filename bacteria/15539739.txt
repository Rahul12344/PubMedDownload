BACKGROUND: Oral lyophilized extracts of bacteria species have been used since
the early 1970s to improve symptoms and to prevent exacerbations in COPD
patients. The value of these treatments, which are thought to be
immunomodulating, is poorly understood. Our aim was to quantify the efficacy of
oral bacteria extracts in patients with chronic bronchitis and COPD.
DESIGN: Systematic review of randomized trials.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases, bibliographies, and contact with authors and 
manufacturers.
REVIEW METHODS: Randomized comparisons of oral purified bacterial (active)
extracts with placebo or no treatment (control) were selected. Meta-analyses were
performed using fixed and random-effects models, and the results were expressed
as relative risk (RR), odds ratio (OR), number needed to treat for one to benefit
(NNTB), or number needed to treat for one to be harmed (NNTH), with 95%
confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Thirteen trials (1,971 patients), most of which were of low quality,
tested OM-85BV (Broncho-Vaxom; OM Pharma; Geneva, Switzerland), LW-50020 (Luivac;
ALTANA Pharma; Bad Homburg, Germany), or SL-04. Two trials (731 patients) had
appropriate methodologies and reported on exacerbations. The RR in favor of the
oral bacterial extract (active) was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.55 to 1.25), and the NNTB was
15.4 (95% CI, 5.5 to infinity; NNTH, 27.5). Five trials (591 patients) reported
on observer-assessed improvement of symptoms RR in favor of active extracts was
0.57 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.66), and the NNTB was 4 (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.4). Two trials 
(n = 344), reported on patient-assessed improvement (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.31 to
0.61) [NNTB, 4; 95% CI, 3.0 to 5.9]. In two trials (163 patients), the average
duration of an exacerbation was shorter with the active extracts (weighted mean
difference, -2.7 days; 95% CI, -3.5 to -1.8). Itching or cutaneous eruptions was 
reported in 3.3% of patients (four trials; 802 patients) who received active
extracts compared with 1.0% of control subjects (OR, 2.94 95% CI, 1.12 to 7.69)
[NNTH, 50; 95% CI, 14 to 161]. Urologic problems (two trials; 671 patients) were 
reported in 8% of patients who received active extracts compared with 3.0% of
control subjects (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.35 to 5.11) [NNTH, 22; 95% CI, 10 to 61].
CONCLUSIONS: Oral purified bacterial extracts improve symptoms in patients with
chronic bronchitis and COPD. There is not enough evidence to suggest that they
prevent exacerbations. Cutaneous and urologic adverse effects are common.
