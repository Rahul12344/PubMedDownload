Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever spirochete in Ixodes ticks that has been 
recently identified as a human pathogen causing hard tick-borne relapsing fever
(HTBRF) across the Northern Hemisphere. No validated serologic test exists, and
current serologic assays have low sensitivity in early HTBRF. To examine the
humoral immune response against B. miyamotoi, we infected C3H/HeN mice with B.
miyamotoi strain LB-2001 expressing variable small protein 1 (Vsp1) and
demonstrated that spirochetemia was cleared after 3 d, coinciding with anti-Vsp1 
IgM production. Clearance was also observed after passive transfer of immune sera
to infected SCID mice. Next, we showed that anti-Vsp1 IgG eliminates
Vsp1-expressing B. miyamotoi, selecting for spirochetes expressing a variable
large protein (VlpC2) resistant to anti-Vsp1. The viability of Asian isolate B.
miyamotoi HT31, expressing Vlp15/16 and Vlp18, was also unaffected by anti-Vsp1. 
Finally, in nine HTBRF patients, we demonstrated IgM reactivity to Vsp1 in two
and against Vlp15/16 in four ∼1 wk after these patients tested positive for B.
miyamotoi by PCR. Our data show that B. miyamotoi is able to express various
variable major proteins (VMPs) to evade humoral immunity and that VMPs are
antigenic in humans. We propose that serologic tests based on VMPs are of
additional value in diagnosing HTBRF.
