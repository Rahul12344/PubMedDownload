BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori vacA genotypes play an important role in the
pathogenesis of severe gastrointestinal disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified a novel polymorphic site in the 3'-end
region of H. pylori vacA gene, denoted by c1/-c2 (c1: with deletion of 15 bp),
and examined associations of this and the previous four sites as well as cagA
status with gastroduodenal diseases, in a total of 217 Iranian H. pylori
isolates. Histopathologic evaluations were performed and patients with gastric
cancer (GC) were further classified based on the anatomic site of tumor,
including cardia and noncardia GC, and the histopathologic type of tumor,
including intestinal- and diffuse-type GC.
RESULTS: The vacA m1, i1, d1, c1, and cagA genotypes were significantly
associated with an increased risk of GC, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval)
was 4.29 (2.03-9.08), 6.11 (2.63-14.19), 3.18 (1.49-6.76), 15.13 (5.86-39.01),
and 2.59 (1.09-6.12), respectively. The vacA c1 genotype had an increased age-
and sex-adjusted risk for GC by the multiple logistic regression analysis; the OR
was 38.32 (95% CI, 6.60-222.29). This association was independent of and larger
than the associations of the m-, i-, and d-type of vacA or cagA status with GC.
No significant correlation was found between s1, whether independently or in
combination, and the risk of GC or peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The vacA i1 and
cagA genotypes were linked to an increased risk of PUD; the OR (95% CI) was 2.80 
(1.45-5.40) and 2.62 (1.23-5.61), respectively. The presence of both the vacA i1 
and cagA genotypes further increased the risk of PUD; the OR was 5.20 (95% CI,
1.92-14.03).
CONCLUSION: The H. pylori vacA c1 genotype might therefore be one of the
strongest risk predictors of GC in male patients aged ≥55 in Iran.
