The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of a short-term exposure to
lead on the blood morphology and the levels of selected cytokines related to
hematopoiesis in occupationally exposed workers. The study population included 37
males occupationally exposed to lead for 36 to 44days. Their blood lead level
raised from 10.7±7.67μg/dl at baseline to the level of 49.1±14.1μg/dl at the end 
of the study. The level of hemoglobin and values of MCH and MCHC were decreased
due to a short-term exposure to lead by 2%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. The counts 
of WBC, LYM, and MXD increased significantly by 5%, 7%, and 35%. Similarly, the
count of PLT increased by 7%, while PDW, MPV, and P-LCR decreased by 6%, 3%, and 
9%, respectively. The levels of IL-7, G-CSF, HGF, PDGF AB/BB, SCF, and PECAM-1,
decreased significantly by 30%, 33%, 8%, 30%, 25%, and 20%, respectively. A
short-term occupational exposure to lead results in a decreased hemoglobin level 
and increased counts of WBC and PLT. Changes in counts and proportions of
different types of leukocytes and decreased values of PLT indices, such as PDW,
MPV, and P-LCR, due to the subacute lead-exposure may be associated with
lead-induced decreased levels of cytokines related to hematopoiesis, including
SCF, G-CSF, IL-7, and PDGF.
