Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS) has microbial pathogen-associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPs). It is a mannoprotein-β glucan complex obtained from
the culture supernatant of Candida albicans NBRC1385 and exhibits
vasculitis-inducing activity (CAWS vasculitis) in mice. The sensitivity to CAWS
vasculitis varies greatly among mouse strains. This study examined the factors
contributing to or inhibiting CAWS vasculitis using CAWS-vasculitis-resistant
CBA/J mice and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk)-deficient CBA/N mice, which is a
CAWS-vasculitis-sensitive strain having the same origin as CBA/J mice. After
stimulation with various kinds of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs),
the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γwas induced in CBA/N mice,
whereas that of immunosuppressive IL-10 was induced in CAWS-vasculitis-resistant 
CBA/J mice. The production of TIMP1, an endogenous matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
inhibitor, was observed in CBA/J mice. Furthermore, the induction of
CAWS-vasculitis was inhibited by gene therapy using plasmid (pCAGGS-mIL-10). The 
results strongly suggest that the difference in the production of these cytokines
is closely linked to the development of CAWS vasculitis.
