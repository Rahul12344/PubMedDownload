Efferocytosis, or clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs), by dendritic cells (DCs)
leads to immune response suppression and tolerance to self-antigens. However,
efferocytosis of infected apoptotic cells (IACs) leads to the production of a
mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine milieu. We examined the DC phenotype
and ability to migrate after phagocytosis of ACs or IACs and observed higher
levels of CD86 and CCR7 expression in DCs, as well as enhanced migration capacity
following efferocytosis of IACs. Interestingly, higher levels of interleukin-1β, 
interleukin-10 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) were also produced in this context.
Blockage of IAC recognition led to an impaired maturation profile and PGE2
production, which may have contributed to reduced CD86 and CCR7 expression and
migration capacity. These data contribute to the understanding of how
efferocytosis of sterile or infected cells may regulate the adaptive immune
response, although the precise role of PGE2 in this process requires further
investigation.
