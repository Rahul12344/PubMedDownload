We and others recently discovered HHLA2 as a new B7 family member and
transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain containing 2 (TMIGD2) as one of its
receptors. Based on a new study we propose that HHLA2 may represent a novel
immunosuppressive mechanism within the tumor microenvironment and hence could be 
a target for cancer therapy. TMIGD2 may be another therapeutic target.
