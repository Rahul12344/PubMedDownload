AFM is a high-resolution (nm scale) imaging tool that mechanically probes a
surface. It has the ability to image cells and biomolecules, in a liquid
environment, without the need to chemically treat the sample. In order to
accomplish this goal, the sample must sufficiently adhere to the mounting surface
to prevent removal by forces exerted by the scanning AFM cantilever tip. In many 
instances, successful imaging depends on immobilization of the sample to the
mounting surface. Optimally, immobilization should be minimally invasive to the
sample such that metabolic processes and functional attributes are not
compromised. By coating freshly cleaved mica surfaces with porcine (pig) gelatin,
negatively charged bacteria can be immobilized on the surface and imaged in
liquid by AFM. Immobilization of bacterial cells on gelatin-coated mica is most
likely due to electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged bacteria
and the positively charged gelatin. Several factors can interfere with bacterial 
immobilization, including chemical constituents of the liquid in which the
bacteria are suspended, the incubation time of the bacteria on the gelatin coated
mica, surface characteristics of the bacterial strain and the medium in which the
bacteria are imaged. Overall, the use of gelatin-coated mica is found to be
generally applicable for imaging microbial cells.
