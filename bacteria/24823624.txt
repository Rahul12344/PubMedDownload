BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common causative pathogen in
community-acquired pneumonia. Mast cells (MCs) are located mainly at the
host-environment interface where they function as sentinels.
OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to study the role of MCs during pneumonia caused by S.
pneumoniae.
METHODS: Lung tissue of patients who had died from pneumococcal pneumonia or a
nonpulmonary cause was stained for MCs and tryptase. Wild-type (WT) and
MC-deficient (Kit(W-sh/W-sh)) mice were observed or sacrificed after induction of
pneumonia by intranasal inoculation of S. pneumoniae. In separate experiments, WT
mice were treated with doxantrazole or cromoglycate, which are MC stabilizing
agents.
RESULTS: The constitutive presence of tryptase-positive MCs was reduced in
affected lungs from pneumonia patients. Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice showed a prolonged
survival during the first few days after median lethal dose (LD)100 and LD50
infection, while overall mortality did not differ from that in WT mice. Relative 
to WT mice, Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice showed reduced bacterial counts with less
bacterial dissemination to distant organs and less inflammation. Neither
doxantrazole nor cromoglycate influenced antibacterial defense or inflammatory
responses after airway infection with S. pneumoniae.
CONCLUSIONS: MCs exhibit an unfavorable role in host defense during pneumococcal 
pneumonia by a mechanism independent of degranulation.
