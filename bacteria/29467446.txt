Oral cholera vaccination is used to induce immune responses in the intestines to 
protect against cholera infection. However, oral vaccination may also affect
immune responses in other mucosal tissues. To study this, tissue-specific homing 
potential and kinetics of B-cell responses were characterized after oral cholera 
vaccination. Healthy adult volunteers received two doses of Dukoral® and blood,
saliva, nasal wash, and fecal samples were collected over time to detect
vaccine-specific antibodies. Additionally, homing potential of lymphocytes to
small intestine, colon, airways, skin, and periphery was measured by expression
of Integrin β1 and β7, CCR9, CCR10, CCR7, and CLA. After vaccination, antibody
responses to cholera toxin B (CTB) and Dukoral® were detected in serum and nasal 
wash. CTB-specific memory B cells in peripheral blood and tissue homing profiles 
of memory B cells peaked at day 18. IgA+ memory B cells expressed markers that
enable homing to the airways and colon, while IgA- memory B cells primarily
expressed small-intestine-homing markers. These data show that oral cholera
vaccination has a differential effect on immune responses in various mucosal
sites, including the respiratory tract.
