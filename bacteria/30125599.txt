IL-8 is elevated during inflammation, and it initiates cascade of down-stream
reactions. Its antagonist, CXCL8 (3-72) K11R/G31P (G31P), represses inflammatory 
reactions via competitive binding to CXC chemokine family, preferentially G
protein-couple receptors (GPCRs) CXCR1/2. This study reports the effect of G31P
on the transcription profile of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation in 
THP-1 monocytes ex-vivo. LPS (1 µg/ml) induced elevation of IL-8 was
significantly reduced by G31P (20 µg/ml and 30 µg/ml), with relatively increased 
inhibition of CXCR2 than CXCR1. Transcription of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α were
significantly inhibited, while IL-10 remained relatively unchanged. G31P
treatment also had repressing effect on the inflammatory associated enzymes
COX-2, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Significant restriction of c-Fos, and NF-kβ mRNA
expression was observed, while that of c-Jun was marginally elevated. Conversely,
SP-1 mRNA expression was seen to increase appreciably by G31P treatment. While
the translation of pAKT, pERK1/2, and p65- NF-kβ were down-regulated by the G31P 
following THP-1 cells stimulation with LPS, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
expression was on the positive trajectory. Collectively, the IL-8 analogue, G31P,
modulates the inflammatory profile of LPS induced inflammation in THP-1 monocytes
via AKT1-NF-kβ and ERK1/2-AP-1 pathways.
