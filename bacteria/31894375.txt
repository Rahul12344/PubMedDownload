In this work we investigated the enzymes produced by Bacillus aryabhattai BA03,
particularly in those involved in ligninolytic activities such as laccases (Lac),
lignin peroxidases (LiP) and Mn-dependent peroxidase (MnD-P). In this way, the
maximal production of Lac (0.069 ± 0.000 U/mL) was obtained at pH 9, and 37 ºC
after 72 h. LiP expressed the highest activity at 96 h in acid medium at 37 ºC
(0.741 ± 0.029 U/mL). Meanwhile, the strain produced MnD-P (1.052 ± 0.001 U/mL)
at the highest temperature assayed (44 ºC) and pH 7 at 72 h. In addition, this
microorganism produced resistant endospores able to germinate after the
sterilization program (121 ºC, 15 min) showing a high enzymatic activity. Using
the heat-treated culture as inoculum, the percentage of decolorization of
150 mg/L of Coomassie Brillant Blue reached 89.42 ± 0.11% in only 24 h. These
results open the use of these enzymes and endospores in bioremediation processes 
carried out under different temperatures and pH values.
