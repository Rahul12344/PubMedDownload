Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) express members of the tumor-necrosis factor
(TNF) receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), but the role of those receptors in the
thymic development of Treg cells is undefined. We found here that Treg cell
progenitors had high expression of the TNFRSF members GITR, OX40 and TNFR2.
Expression of those receptors correlated directly with the signal strength of the
T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and required the coreceptor CD28 and the kinase
TAK1. The neutralization of ligands that are members of the TNF superfamily
(TNFSF) diminished the development of Treg cells. Conversely, TNFRSF agonists
enhanced the differentiation of Treg cell progenitors by augmenting
responsiveness of the interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) and transcription factor
STAT5. Costimulation with the ligand of GITR elicited dose-dependent enrichment
for cells of lower TCR affinity in the Treg cell repertoire. In vivo, combined
inhibition of GITR, OX40 and TNFR2 abrogated the development of Treg cells. Thus,
expression of members of the TNFRSF on Treg cell progenitors translated strong
TCR signals into molecular parameters that specifically promoted the development 
of Treg cells and shaped the Treg cell repertoire.
