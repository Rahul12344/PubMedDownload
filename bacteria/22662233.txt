but not limb outgrowth.

Outgrowth and patterning of the vertebrate limb requires a functional apical
ectodermal ridge (AER). The AER is a thickening of ectodermal tissue located at
the distal end of the limb bud. Loss of this structure, either through genetic or
physical manipulations results in truncation of the limb. A number of genes,
including Bmps, are expressed in the AER. Previously, it was shown that removal
of the BMP receptor Bmpr1a specifically from the AER resulted in complete loss of
hindlimbs suggesting that Bmp signaling in the AER is required for limb
outgrowth. In this report, we genetically removed the three known AER-expressed
Bmp ligands, Bmp2, Bmp4 and Bmp7 from the AER of the limb bud using floxed
conditional alleles and the Msx2-cre allele. Surprisingly, only defects in digit 
patterning and not limb outgrowth were observed. In triple mutants, the anterior 
and posterior AER was present but loss of the central region of the AER was
observed. These data suggest that Bmp ligands expressed in the AER are not
required for limb outgrowth but instead play an essential role in maintaining the
AER and patterning vertebrate digits.
