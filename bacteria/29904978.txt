Nasal cytology is an easy, cheap, non-invasive and point-of-care method to assess
nasal inflammation and disease-specific cellular features. By means of nasal
cytology, it is possible to distinguish between different inflammatory patterns
that are typically associated with specific diseases (ie, allergic and
non-allergic rhinitis). Its use is particularly relevant when other clinical
information, such as signs, symptoms, time-course and allergic sensitizations, is
not enough to recognize which of the different rhinitis phenotypes is involved;
for example, it is only by means of nasal cytology that it is possible to
distinguish, among the non-allergic rhinitis, those characterized by eosinophilic
(NARES), mast cellular (NARMA), mixed eosinophilic-mast cellular (NARESMA) or
neutrophilic (NARNE) inflammation. Despite its clinical usefulness, cheapness,
non-invasiveness and easiness, nasal cytology is still underused and this is at
least partially due to the fact that, as far as now, there is not a consensus or 
an official recommendation on its methodological issues. We here review the
scientific literature about nasal cytology, giving recommendations on how to
perform and interpret nasal cytology.
