Autosomal dominant hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), or Job's syndrome, is a primary 
immune deficiency caused by dominant-negative mutations in STAT3. Recurrent
Staphylococcus aureus skin abscesses are a defining feature of this syndrome. A
widely held hypothesis that defects in peripheral Th17 differentiation confer
this susceptibility has never been directly evaluated. To assess the cutaneous
immune response in AD-HIES, we induced suction blisters in healthy volunteers
(HVs) and patients with AD-HIES and then challenged the wound with lethally
irradiated bacteria. We show that cutaneous production of IL-17A and IL-17F was
normal in patients with AD-HIES. Overproduction of TNF-α differentiated the
responses in AD-HIES from HVs. This was associated with reduced IL-10 family
signaling in blister-infiltrating cells and defective epithelial cell function.
Mouse models of AD-HIES recapitulated these aberrant epithelial responses to S.
aureus and involved defective epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) rather
than a failure of bacterial killing. Defective responses in mouse models of
AD-HIES and primary keratinocyte cultures from patients with AD-HIES could be
reversed by TNF-α blockade and by drugs with reported modulatory effects on EMT. 
Our results identify these as potential therapeutic approaches in patients with
AD-HIES suffering S. aureus infections.
