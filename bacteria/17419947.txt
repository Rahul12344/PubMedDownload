Like any growing healthy tissues, tumors build up their blood vessels by three
mechanisms: angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and intersucception. Vascular
endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) is one of the key factors responsible for
stimulation and maintenance of the disorganized, leaky, and torturous tumor
vasculature. In addition to VEGF-A, tumors produce multiple other factors to
stimulate blood vessel growth. These include members in the platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), VEGF-C, insulin-like growth
factor (IGF), angiopoietin (Ang), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) families.
Recent studies show that these angiogenic factors can also promote
lymphangiogenesis and potentially lymphatic metastasis. Understanding the roles
of individual and combined angiogenic factors in promoting tumor angiogenesis is 
crucial for defining therapeutic targets and antiangiogenic drug development for 
the treatment of cancer.
