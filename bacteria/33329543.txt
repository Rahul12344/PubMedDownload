Introduction and Objective: Neoantigen-based immunotherapy is one of the
breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy. Benefit from the Cancer Genome Atlas
database, we intended to identify mutant peptides with neoantigen property in
bladder cancer (BC). Correlations between the immunoreactivity of candidate
neoantigens and clinical manifestations were further analyzed.
Methods: HLA-A*02:01 restricted mutant (MT) and wildtype (WT) peptides were
predicted by using whole exome sequencing data of 412 BC patients in the TCGA
database. Binding affinity to HLA-A2 molecules was determined by using T2
cell-based binding assay. The immunoreactivity to WT and MT peptides in HLA-A2+
BC patients was determined by using an ELISPOT assay upon in vitro stimulation
with MT and WT peptides individually. Clinical relevance to peptide-specific
immunoreactivity was analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis. The disease free
survival (DFS) curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method in BC patients
with or without mutations and compared using the log-rank test online.
Results: Fifty-seven HLA-A*02:01 restricted WT and MT peptides were selected
based on predicted high affinity and expression frequency, among which 12 MT
peptides from 12 individual genes exhibited strong affinity to HLA-A2 molecules
when compared to WT counterparts. MT peptides induced more peptide-specific IFNγ 
spot forming units (SFUs) than WT counterparts in HLA-A2+ BC patients upon in
vitro stimulation. They were negatively correlated to the counts of peripheral
leukocytes and platelets. Patients with higher C-reactive protein level exhibited
lower immunoreactivity to MT peptides. Combination of MT peptides from 6 genes,
including CDKN1AG61V , RHOBP75L , DDB1S25L , AHNAKD4855Y , ANP32AS56L and
MKI67H84L covered 47.5% of the patients under investigation. Patients harboring
combinational mutations in these genes were associated with a longer DFS
according to the cBioportal online analysis.
Conclusion: Twelve HLA-A*02:01 restricted MT peptides have been identified
exhibiting higher binding affinity to HLA-A2 molecules and stronger
immunoreactivity than WT counterparts in BC patients. Combination of MT peptides 
from six genes might be potential as neoantigen candidates in cancer
immunotherapy against BC in the future. Inflammatory modulation is inclined to be
a strategy to enhance the efficacy of neoantigen-based immunotherapy.
