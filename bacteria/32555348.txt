Orderly chromosome segregation is enabled by crossovers between homologous
chromosomes in the first meiotic division. Crossovers arise from
recombination-mediated repair of programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).
Multiple DSBs initiate recombination, and most are repaired without crossover
formation, although one or more generate crossovers on each chromosome. Although 
the underlying mechanisms are ill-defined, the differentiation and maturation of 
crossover-specific recombination intermediates requires the cyclin-like CNTD1.
Here, we identify PRR19 as a partner of CNTD1. We find that, like CNTD1, PRR19 is
required for timely DSB repair and the formation of crossover-specific
recombination complexes. PRR19 and CNTD1 co-localise at crossover sites,
physically interact, and are interdependent for accumulation, indicating a
PRR19-CNTD1 partnership in crossing over. Further, we show that CNTD1 interacts
with a cyclin-dependent kinase, CDK2, which also accumulates in
crossover-specific recombination complexes. Thus, the PRR19-CNTD1 complex may
enable crossover differentiation by regulating CDK2.
