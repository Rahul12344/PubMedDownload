Whereas intracellular carbon metabolism has emerged as an attractive drug target,
the carbon sources of intracellularly replicating pathogens, such as the
tuberculosis bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes long-term
infections in one-third of the world's population, remain mostly unknown. We used
a systems-based approach--(13)C-flux spectral analysis (FSA) complemented with
manual analysis-to measure the metabolic interaction between M. tuberculosis and 
its macrophage host cell. (13)C-FSA analysis of experimental data showed that M. 
tuberculosis obtains a mixture of amino acids, C1 and C2 substrates from its host
cell. We experimentally confirmed that the C1 substrate was derived from CO2.
(13)C labeling experiments performed on a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
mutant revealed that intracellular M. tuberculosis has access to glycolytic C3
substrates. These findings provide constraints for developing novel
chemotherapeutics.
