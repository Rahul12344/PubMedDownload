The soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis can get into contact with growth-inhibiting 
substances, which may be of anthropogenic origin. Glyphosate is such a substance 
serving as a nonselective herbicide. Glyphosate specifically inhibits the
5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, which generates an essential
precursor for de novo synthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants, fungi,
bacteria and archaea. Inhibition of the EPSP synthase by glyphosate results in
depletion of the cellular levels of aromatic amino acids unless the environment
provides them. Here, we have assessed the potential of B. subtilis to adapt to
glyphosate at the genome level. In contrast to Escherichia coli, which evolves
glyphosate resistance by elevating the production and decreasing the glyphosate
sensitivity of the EPSP synthase, B. subtilis primarily inactivates the gltT gene
encoding the high-affinity glutamate/aspartate symporter GltT. Further adaptation
of the gltT mutants to glyphosate led to the inactivation of the gltP gene
encoding the glutamate transporter GltP. Metabolome analyses confirmed that GltT 
is the major entryway of glyphosate into B. subtilis. GltP, the GltT homologue of
E. coli also transports glyphosate into B. subtilis. Finally, we found that GltT 
is involved in uptake of the herbicide glufosinate, which inhibits the glutamine 
synthetase.
