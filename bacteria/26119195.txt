BACKGROUND: CD1d presents glycolipid antigens to invariant natural killer T
(iNKT) cells. The role of CD1d in the development of peptic ulcer and gastric
cancer has not been revealed, yet.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the expression of alternatively spliced variants of CD1d in
peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.
METHODS: Patients with dyspepsia were selected and divided into three groups of
non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and gastric cancer (GC),
according to their endoscopic and histopathological examinations. H. pylori
infection was diagnosed by rapid urease test and histopathology. The expression
levels of V2, V4, and V5 spliced variants of CD1d molecule were determined by
quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR.
RESULTS: Relative gene expression levels of V4 were higher in GC patients (n=37) 
than those in NUD (n=49) and PUD (n=51) groups (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively).
Moreover, GC patients showed higher expression levels of V5 compared to NUD and
PUD groups (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Positive correlation coefficients
were attained between V4 and V5 expression in patients with PUD (r=0.734,
p<0.0001) and GC (r=0.423, p<0.01), but not in patients with NUD. Among NUD
patients, the expression levels of V4, but not V5, were higher in H.
pylori-positive patients than in H. pylori-negative ones (p<0.01).
CONCLUSION: Collectively, both membrane-bound (V4) and soluble (V5) isoforms of
CD1d were over-expressed in gastric tumor tissues, suggesting that they are
involved in anti-tumor immune responses.
