BACKGROUND: Methionine, a central molecule in one-carbon metabolism, is an
essential amino acid required for normal growth and development. Despite its
importance to biological systems, methionine is toxic when administered at
supra-physiological levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects 
of short-term methionine dietary modulation on the proximal jejunum, the section 
of the gut specifically responsible for amino acid absorption, in a mouse model. 
Eight-week-old CBA/J male mice were fed methionine-adequate (MAD; 6.5 g/kg) or
methionine-supplemented (MSD; 19.5 g/kg) diets for 3.5 or 6 days (average food
intake 100 g/kg body weight). The study design was developed in order to address 
the short-term effects of the methionine supplementation that corresponds to
methionine dietary intake in Western populations. Biochemical indices in the
blood as well as metabolic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, metagenomic, and
histomorphological parameters in the gut were evaluated.
RESULTS: By day 6, feeding mice with MSD (protein intake <10% different from MAD)
resulted in increased plasma (2.3-fold; p < 0.054), but decreased proximal
jejunum methionine concentrations (2.2-fold; p < 0.05) independently of the
expression of neutral amino acid transporters. MSD has also caused small bowel
bacteria colonization, increased the abundance of pathogenic bacterial species
Burkholderiales and decreased the gene expression of the intestinal transmembrane
proteins-Cldn8 (0.18-fold, p < 0.05), Cldn9 (0.24-fold, p < 0.01) and Cldn10
(0.05-fold, p < 0.05). Feeding MSD led to substantial histomorphological
alterations in the proximal jejunum exhibited as a trend towards decreased plasma
citrulline concentrations (1.8-fold, p < 0.07), as well as loss of crypt depth
(by 28%, p < 0.05) and mucosal surface (by 20%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Together, these changes indicate that short-term feeding of MSD
substantially alters the normal gut physiology. These effects may contribute to
the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory diseases and/or sensitize the gut to 
exposure to other stressors.
