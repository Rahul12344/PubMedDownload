Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is an essential enzyme in bacteria 
that catalyses a rate-limiting step in coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, by
transferring an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine, yielding
dephospho-CoA (dPCoA). Each phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) subunit
displays a dinucleotide-binding fold that is structurally similar to that in
class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Superposition of bound adenylyl moieties from
dPCoA in PPAT and ATP in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases suggests nucleophilic attack 
by the 4'-phosphopantetheine on the alpha-phosphate of ATP. The proposed
catalytic mechanism implicates transition state stabilization by PPAT without
involving functional groups of the enzyme in a chemical sense in the reaction.
The crystal structure of the enzyme from Escherichia coli in complex with dPCoA
shows that binding at one site causes a vice-like movement of active site
residues lining the active site surface. The mode of enzyme product formation is 
highly concerted, with only one trimer of the PPAT hexamer showing evidence of
dPCoA binding. The homologous active site attachment of ATP and the structural
distribution of predicted sequence-binding motifs in PPAT classify the enzyme as 
belonging to the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily.
