We designed novel bilayer-forming amphiphiles based on the cyclic oligo-Asp-based
peptide gemini (PG) surfactants cr-D2C12 and cr-D3C12, which consist of
-Cys(Asp)nCys- (n = 2 or 3) as a core peptide and two Cys residues containing a
dodecylamidomethyl group. Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron
microscopy measurements revealed the formation of spherical bilayer membranes
that could incorporate the light-harvesting antenna complex 2 (LH2) from
Rhodopseudomonas acidophila . Furthermore, this proteoliposome-like conjugate
could be assembled onto cationized glass and mica to form planar bilayer
membranes incorporating LH2. Using atomic force microscopy, we observed LH2
protruding (ca. 1.2-1.5 nm) from flat terraces of the planar bilayer membranes
formed from cr-D2C12 or cr-D3C12. Thus, our designed PG surfactants are a new
class of bilayer-forming amphiphiles that may be applied to the study of various 
membrane proteins.
