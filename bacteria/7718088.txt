Psoriasis is a T-cell-mediated disease that can be triggered by infection with
group A beta-haemolytic streptococci. It is proposed that psoriatic skin lesions 
are initiated by exotoxin-activated T cells, and persist because of specific T
cells that react both with streptococcal M protein and a skin determinant,
possibly a variant of keratin. As discussed here by Helgi Valdimarsson and
colleagues, cytokines released by the superantigen (SAg)-stimulated T cells could
induce or enhance the expression of the crossreactive autoantigen, leading to the
rescue and activation of autoreactive T cells. In this way, the SAg-determined
T-cell receptor V beta phenotype would be maintained by T cells in psoriatic
lesions.
