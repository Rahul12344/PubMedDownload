The mechanisms regulating T lymphocyte migration within the extracellular matrix 
are not understood. We show in this study that the thrombospondin-1 binding site 
of calreticulin, spanning aa 19-32, is a major triggering factor for T cell
motility and migration within a three-dimensional collagen type 1 matrix, and
that exogenous motogenic factors such as chemokines can stimulate migration via a
calreticulin-thrombospondin-1 pathway. Endogenous calreticulin binding to the
N-terminal domain of endogenous thrombospondin-1 elicited a motogenic signal to
the T cells through the C-terminal domain of thrombospondin-1 and its cell
surface receptor integrin-associated protein (CD47). Our data further revealed
that thrombospondin-1 was expressed on the cell surface with a high turnover, and
that PI3K and the Janus family of tyrosine kinases were required for T cell
motility mediated through calreticulin, thrombospondin-1, and CD47. These results
unveil an autocrine mechanism of calreticulin-thrombospondin-1-CD47 interaction
for the control of T cell motility and migration within three-dimensional
extracellular matrix substrata.
