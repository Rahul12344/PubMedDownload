Despite its inclusion in pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 13 (PCV13), Streptococcus
pneumoniae serotype 3 remains a major cause of invasive pneumococcal disease in
England and Wales. Previous studies have indicated that there are distinct
lineages within serotype 3 clonal complex 180 and the clade distributions have
shifted in recent years with the emergence of clade II. We undertook whole genome
sequencing and genomic analysis of 616 serotype 3 isolates from England and Wales
between 2003 and 2018, including invasive and carriage isolates. Our
investigations showed that clade II has expanded since 2014 and now represents
50% of serotype 3 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) isolates in England and
Wales. Genomic analysis of antibiotic resistance and protein antigen genes showed
that distinct profiles are present within the clades which could account for the 
recent emergence of this clade. This investigation highlights the importance and 
utility of routine whole genome sequencing and its ability to identify new and
emerging variation at the single nucleotide level which informs surveillance and 
will impact future vaccine development.
