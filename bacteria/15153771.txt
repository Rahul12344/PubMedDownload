Several yellow-pigmented species within the family Flavobacteriaceae are commonly
associated with diseases in fish and are difficult to speciate due to their
fastidious, slow-growing nature and cross-reactive antigens. Here we report the
development of specific, antibody-diagnostic tests for Flavobacterium
psychrophilum, the aetiological agent of rainbow trout fry syndrome and bacterial
cold water disease. A unique antigen from F. psychrophilum, the
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-polysaccharide (O-PS), formed the basis for the
antibody test. LPS O-PS was purified and conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin
and bovine serum albumin for the generation of rabbit immune sera and the
development of antibody-based diagnostic tests. Rabbit polyclonal anti-O-PS serum
was highly specific for F. psychrophilum, without the need for prior
cross-absorption with related bacteria and was the basis of an effective ELISA
diagnostic test. Antibodies were purified from rabbit anti-O-PS serum and
adsorbed onto coloured latex beads for the development of a specific, bead
agglutination assay for F. psychrophilum.
