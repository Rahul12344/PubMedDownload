Pyrrhic Progress analyses over half a century of antibiotic use, regulation, and 
resistance in US and British food production. Mass-introduced after 1945,
antibiotics helped revolutionize post-war agriculture. Food producers used
antibiotics to prevent and treat disease, protect plants, preserve food, and
promote animals’ growth. Many soon became dependent on routine antibiotic use to 
sustain and increase production. The resulting growth of antibiotic
infrastructures came at a price. Critics blamed antibiotics for leaving dangerous
residues in food, enabling bad animal welfare, and selecting for antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) in bacteria, which could no longer be treated with antibiotics. 
Pyrrhic Progress reconstructs the complicated negotiations that accompanied this 
process of risk prioritization between consumers, farmers, and regulators on both
sides of the Atlantic. Unsurprisingly, solutions differed: while Europeans
implemented precautionary antibiotic restrictions to curb AMR, consumer concerns 
and cost-benefit assessments made US regulators focus on curbing drug residues in
food. The result was a growing divergence of antibiotic stewardship and a rise of
AMR. Kirchhelle’s comprehensive analysis of evolving non-human antibiotic use and
the historical complexities of antibiotic stewardship provides important insights
for current debates on the global burden of AMR.
