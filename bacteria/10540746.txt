The crustacean molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH) suppresses ecdysteroid synthesis by 
the Y-organ. The MIH of the kuruma prawn Penaeus japonicus has recently been
isolated and its cDNA cloned. In this study, we expressed the MIH in Escherichia 
coli to obtain a large quantity of this hormone with biological activity. The MIH
cDNA was processed and ligated into an expression plasmid. E. coli was
transformed with this plasmid, and then the recombinant MIH (r-MIH) was
expressed. The r-MIH was put through the refolding reaction and was purified by
reverse-phase HPLC. N-terminal amino acid sequence and time-of-flight mass
spectral analyses supported the idea that the r-MIH had the entire sequence. By
in vitro bioassay using the Y-organ of the crayfish, the r-MIH was found to be
comparable to natural MIH in inhibiting ecdysteroid synthesis.
