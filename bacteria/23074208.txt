PURPOSE: Exogenous vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) down-regulates
pro-inflammatory but up-regulates anti-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors
(GFs) and Toll-like receptors promoting healing in experimental Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) keratitis. Whether VIP is required for GF or GF
receptor (R) expression in normal and infected corneas is unknown and is the
purpose of this study.
METHODS: VIP knockout ((-/-)) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 (B6) mice were infected 
and tested using PCR array, real-time RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunostaining. VIP
antagonist treatment studies also were done using B6 and BALB/c mice.
RESULTS: Infected corneas of VIP(-/-) versus WT B6 mice perforated earlier (2 vs.
5 days postinfection [p.i.]), and array data showed that GFs were differentially 
changed between groups. RT-PCR revealed that the infected cornea of VIP(-/-)
versus WT mice expressed higher mRNA levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), reduced FGF, EGFR, and HGFR, with no difference
in FGFR; differences between groups were not seen in normal cornea.
Immunostaining for GF and GFR in the normal cornea of VIP(-/-) versus WT mice was
similar. However, at 1 day p.i., VIP(-/-) versus WT mice had more intense EGF and
HGF, similar FGFR, and reduced FGF, EGFR, and HGFR staining. VIP antagonist
treatment decreased protein levels for GFR at 5 days p.i. in both B6 and BALB/c
mice, with no significant changes in normal cornea.
CONCLUSIONS: The data showed that endogenous VIP is not requisite for GF or GFR
expression in the normal cornea but, after infection, its absence or reduction is
critical for their regulation.
