We describe an HIV-infected patient with central diabetes insipidus as a
complication of cryptococcal meningitis. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus as a
result of amphotericin B treatment is a rare but known complication. Central
diabetes insipidus in cryptococcal meningitis has not been reported before. The
patient responded well to desmopressin treatment.
