Unequivocal demonstration of the therapeutic utility of Î³-retroviral vectors for 
gene therapy applications targeting the hematopoietic system was accompanied by
instances of insertional mutagenesis. These events stimulated the ongoing
development of putatively safer integrating vector systems and analysis methods
to characterize and compare integration site (IS) biosafety profiles. Continuing 
advances in next-generation sequencing technologies are driving the generation of
ever-more complex IS datasets. Available bioinformatic tools to compare such
datasets focus on the association of integration sites (ISs) with selected
genomic and epigenetic features, and the choice of these features determines the 
ability to discriminate between datasets. We describe the scalable application of
point-process coherence analysis (CA) to compare patterns produced by vector ISs 
across genomic intervals, uncoupled from association with genomic features. To
explore the utility of CA in the context of an unresolved question, we asked
whether the differing transduction conditions used in the initial Paris and
London SCID-X1 gene therapy trials result in divergent genome-wide integration
profiles. We tested a transduction carried out under each condition, and showed
that CA could indeed resolve differences in IS distributions. Existence of these 
differences was confirmed by the application of established methods to compare
integration datasets.
