Three high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of malate dehydrogenase (MDH; EC
1.1.1.37) from the methylotroph Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 are presented. By
comparing the structures of apo MDH, a binary complex of MDH and NAD+, and a
ternary complex of MDH and oxaloacetate with ADP-ribose occupying the pyridine
nucleotide-binding site, conformational changes associated with the formation of 
the catalytic complex were characterized. While the substrate-binding site is
accessible in the enzyme resting state or NAD+-bound forms, the substrate-bound
form exhibits a closed conformation. This conformational change involves the
transition of an α-helix to a 310-helix, which causes the adjacent loop to close 
the active site following coenzyme and substrate binding. In the ternary complex,
His284 forms a hydrogen bond to the C2 carbonyl of oxaloacetate, placing it in a 
position to donate a proton in the formation of (2S)-malate.
