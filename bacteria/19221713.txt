PURPOSE: Multiresistant and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) can
cause serious infections in hospitalized patients with various co-morbid
diseases. We investigated the course of VRE peritonitis after cecal ligation and 
puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis and compared this to sham operated mice.
METHODS: Mice were subjected to CLP or sham surgery. Forty-eight hours thereafter
four groups were created by subjecting mice to peritoneal injection of either VRE
or saline.
RESULTS: Mice infected with VRE after CLP were severely impaired in eliminating
VRE from the peritoneal cavity and distant body sites. These mice failed to mount
an early inflammatory response at the primary site of VRE infection. VRE
superinfection did not influence CLP-induced organ damage or polymicrobial
bacterial loads.
CONCLUSIONS: Sublethal polymicrobial sepsis greatly facilitates infection and
dissemination of VRE. VRE does not influence the course of CLP-induced sepsis.
