The final two enzymes in the CoA biosynthetic pathway, phosphopantetheine
adenylyltransferase (PPAT; EC 2.7.7.3) and dephospho-CoA kinase (DPCK; EC
2.7.1.24), are separate proteins in prokaryotes, but exist as a bifunctional
enzyme in pig liver. In the present study we have obtained sequence information
from purified pig-liver enzyme, and identified the corresponding cDNA in a number
of species. The human gene localizes to chromosome 17q12-21 and contains regions 
with sequence similarity to the monofunctional Escherichia coli DPCK and PPAT.
The recombinant 564-amino-acid human protein confirmed the associated transferase
and kinase activities, and gave similar kinetic properties to the wild-type pig
enzyme.
