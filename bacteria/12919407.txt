Members of the genus Burkholderia are versatile organisms that occupy a
surprisingly wide range of ecological niches. These bacteria are exploited for
biocontrol, bioremediation and plant growth promotion purposes, but safety issues
regarding human infections, especially in cystic fibrosis patients, have not been
solved. This minireview gives an overview of the taxonomic and ecological
diversity of the genus with particular emphasis on strains belonging to the
Burkholderia cepacia complex and addresses the important question whether 'good' 
and 'bad' strains are actually the same.
