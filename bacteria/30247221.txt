OBJECTIVES: Persistent infection with human papillomavirus causes cervical
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs). The role of antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) in premalignant and malignant transformation is not fully
understood. In this study, we examined the expression of human Î²-defensin 1
(HBD-1), HBD-2, HBD-3, LL37, psoriasin, and interleukin 8 (IL-8) in women with
HSIL before and 6 months after surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biopsies and secretion samples from the cervical canal
were collected from 19 patients with HSIL and 14 healthy controls. The mRNA
expression of HBD-1, HBD-2, HBD-3, LL37, psoriasin, and IL-8 was analyzed before 
and 6 months after surgery excision using reverse transcriptase real time
polymerase chain reaction. For protein analyses, ELISA and immunohistochemistry
were used for psoriasin and ELISA for IL-8.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression of psoriasin was lower in patients before treatment 
compared with healthy controls (p = .05). After surgery, when the infection was
cleared, psoriasin increased on mRNA (p = .04) and protein (p = .03) levels
compared with before treatment. Immunostaining for psoriasin after treatment was 
prominent and localized in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. After
treatment, IL-8 mRNA was reduced compared with before treatment (p = .05), but
not on the protein level. No changes in mRNA expression of the other AMPs
analyzed were observed in pretreatment and posttreatment samples.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study of AMP expression in human papillomavirus-induced
HSIL, we observed lower psoriasin levels before surgery compared with after
treatment, when both mRNA and protein levels were similar to healthy controls.
Interleukin 8, on the other hand, was increased before treatment, indicating an
inflammatory response.
