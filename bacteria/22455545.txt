BACKGROUND: S. pneumoniae is the most common causative agent of meningitis, and
is associated with high morbidity and mortality. We aimed to develop an
integrated and representative pneumococcal meningitis mouse model resembling the 
human situation.
METHODS: Adult mice (C57BL/6) were inoculated in the cisterna magna with
increasing doses of S. pneumoniae serotype 3 colony forming units (CFU; n = 24,
104, 105, 106 and 107 CFU) and survival studies were performed. Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF), brain, blood, spleen, and lungs were collected. Subsequently, mice
were inoculated with 104 CFU S. pneumoniae serotype 3 and sacrificed at 6 (n = 6)
and 30 hours (n = 6). Outcome parameters were bacterial outgrowth, clinical
score, and cytokine and chemokine levels (using Luminex®) in CSF, blood and
brain. Meningeal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, parenchymal and
subarachnoidal hemorrhages, microglial activation and hippocampal apoptosis were 
assessed in histopathological studies.
RESULTS: Lower doses of bacteria delayed onset of illness and time of death
(median survival CFU 104, 56 hrs; 105, 38 hrs, 106, 28 hrs. 107, 24 hrs).
Bacterial titers in brain and CSF were similar in all mice at the end-stage of
disease independent of inoculation dose, though bacterial outgrowth in the
systemic compartment was less at lower inoculation doses. At 30 hours after
inoculation with 104 CFU of S. pneumoniae, blood levels of KC, IL6, MIP-2 and
IFN- γ were elevated, as were brain homogenate levels of KC, MIP-2, IL-6, IL-1β
and RANTES. Brain histology uniformly showed meningeal inflammation at 6 hours,
and, neutrophil infiltration, microglial activation, and hippocampal apoptosis at
30 hours. Parenchymal and subarachnoidal and cortical hemorrhages were seen in 5 
of 6 and 3 of 6 mice at 6 and 30 hours, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We have developed and validated a murine model of pneumococcal
meningitis.
