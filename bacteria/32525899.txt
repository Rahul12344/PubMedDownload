High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and deadly type of
ovarian cancer, largely due to difficulties in early diagnosis and rapid
metastasis throughout the peritoneal cavity. Previous studies have shown that
expression of Notch3 correlates with worse prognosis and increased tumorigenic
cell behaviors in HGSC. We investigated the mechanistic role of Notch3 in a model
of metastatic ovarian cancer using the murine ovarian surface epithelial cell
line, ID8 IP2. Notch3 was activated in ID8 IP2 cells via expression of the Notch3
intracellular domain (Notch3IC). Notch3IC ID8 IP2 cells injected
intraperitoneally caused accelerated ascites and reduced survival compared to
control ID8 IP2, particularly in early stages of disease. We interrogated
downstream targets of Notch3IC in ID8 IP2 cells by RNA sequencing and found
significant induction of genes that encode adhesion and extracellular matrix
proteins. Notch3IC ID8 IP2 showed increased expression of ITGA1 mRNA and
cell-surface protein. Notch3IC-mediated increase of ITGA1 was also seen in two
human ovarian cancer cells. Notch3IC ID8 IP2 cells showed increased adhesion to
collagens I and IV in vitro. We propose that Notch3 activation in ovarian cancer 
cells causes increased adherence to collagen-rich peritoneal surfaces. Thus, the 
correlation between increased Notch3 signaling and poor prognosis may be
influenced by increased metastasis of HGSC via increased adherence of
disseminating cells to new metastatic sites in the peritoneum.
