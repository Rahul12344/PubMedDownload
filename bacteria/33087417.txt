Resistance to immunotherapy is a significant challenge, and the scarcity of human
models hinders the identification of the underlying mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we constructed an autologous humanized mouse (aHM) model with
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and tumors from 2 melanoma
patients progressing to immunotherapy. Unlike mismatched humanized mouse (mHM)
models, generated from cord blood-derived HSPCs and tumors from different donors,
the aHM recapitulates a patient-specific tumor microenvironment (TME). When
patient tumors were implanted on aHM, mHM, and NOD/SCID/IL2rg-/- (NSG) cohorts,
tumors appeared earlier and grew faster on NSG and mHM cohorts. We observed that 
immune cells differentiating in the aHM were relatively more capable of
circulating peripherally, invading into tumors and interacting with the TME. A
heterologous, human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A) matched cohort also yielded slower 
growing tumors than non-HLA-matched mHM, indicating that a less permissive immune
environment inhibits tumor progression. When the aHM, mHM, and NSG cohorts were
treated with immunotherapies mirroring what the originating patients received,
tumor growth in the aHM accelerated, similar to the progression observed in the
patients. This rapid growth was associated with decreased immune cell
infiltration, reduced interferon gamma (IFNγ)-related gene expression, and a
reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation, events that were replicated in vitro using
tumor-derived cell lines. IMPLICATIONS: Engrafted adult HSPCs give rise to more
tumor infiltrative immune cells, increased HLA matching leads to slower tumor
initiation and growth, and continuing immunotherapy past progression can
paradoxically lead to increased growth.
