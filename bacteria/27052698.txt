Considering that several recent cases of human gastroenteritis have been
associated with species from the Arcobacter genus, and that few data are
currently available about the occurrence of this genus in Italian shellfish, the 
aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. and
the presence of virulence-associated genes. The approach consisted of cultural
and biomolecular (multiplex-PCR and 16S-RFLP) methods identifying isolates,
followed by PCR assays aimed at the cadF, ciaB, cjl349, irgA, hecA putative
virulence genes. Arcobacter spp. was detected in 16/70 (22.8%) shellfish samples.
Specifically, Arcobacter spp. was highlighted in 10/42 (23.8%) mussel and in 6/28
(21.4%) clam samples. Subsequently, biomolecular assays revealed Arcobacter
butzleri in 12/16 (75%) and Arcobacter cryaerophilus 1B in 4/16 (25%) isolates.
PCRs aimed at the five putative virulence genes demonstrated widespread
distribution of these genes among Arcobacter isolates and some differences from
the results published by other authors. Our research provides more information
regarding the health risks associated with the consumption of raw bivalve
molluscs and underlines the need to implement an adequate control plan by
performing intensive and continuous monitoring in order to guarantee human
health.
