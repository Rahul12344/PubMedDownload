BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of β-glucan on the 
expression of inflammatory mediators and metabolomic profile of oral cells
[keratinocytes (OBA-9) and fibroblasts (HGF-1) in a dual-chamber model] infected 
by Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The periodontopathogen was applied and 
allowed to cross the top layer of cells (OBA-9) to reach the bottom layer of
cells (HGF-1) and induce the synthesis of immune factors and cytokines in the
host cells. β-glucan (10 μg/mL or 20 μg/mL) were added, and the transcriptional
factors and metabolites produced were quantified in the remaining cell layers and
supernatant.
RESULTS: The relative expression of interleukin (IL)-1-α and IL-18 genes in HGF-1
decreased with 10 μg/mL or 20 μg/mL of β-glucan, where as the expression of
PTGS-2 decreased only with 10 μg/mL. The expression of IL-1-α increased with
20 μg/mL and that of IL-18 increased with 10 μg/mL in OBA-9; the expression of
BCL 2, EP 300, and PTGS-2 decreased with the higher dose of β-glucan. The
production of the metabolite 4-aminobutyric acid presented lower concentrations
under 20 μg/mL, whereas the concentrations of 2-deoxytetronic acid NIST and
oxalic acid decreased at both concentrations used. Acetophenone, benzoic acid,
and pinitol presented reduced concentrations only when treated with 10 μg/mL of
β-glucan.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with β-glucans positively modulated the immune response
and production of metabolites.
