BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding vitamin D-associated
factors in patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) lung disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between vitamin D-related factors and
susceptibility to NTM lung disease.
DESIGN: The relative gene expression levels of cathelicidin (CAMP), defensin
(DEFB4), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), as well as the
serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), cathelicidin (LL-37), defensin
(hBD-2) and vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) from 82 patients with NTM lung
disease and 28 control subjects were analysed.
RESULTS: Gene expression of CAMP and DEFB4 was significantly higher, and gene
expression of VDR and CYP27B1 was significantly lower, in NTM patients than
controls. Serum LL-37 and hBD-2 levels were not significantly different between
NTM patients and controls; however, the serum DBP level was higher in NTM
patients than controls. The serum vitamin D status of patients did not correlate 
with serum LL-37, hBD-2, or DBP concentration or gene expression of CAMP, DEFB4, 
VDR or CYP27B1.
CONCLUSION: A higher level of gene expression for antimicrobial peptide is more
likely to be associated with NTM lung disease than serum vitamin D status.
