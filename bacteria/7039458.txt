[Acute neutropenia in adult severe bacterial infections. Six cases (author's

A transient neutropenia (duration : less than 48 hours) occurred in 6 patients
with severe bacterial infections. The bone marrow myeloïd cellularity was high or
normal; a maturation arrest of the myeloïd cells - at a variable stage - was
present in each case, as well as circulating granulocyte precursors. Other causes
of neutropenia were excluded. A general survey of the literature is made and the 
mechanisms of this bacterial neutropenia are considered : bone marrow failure
seems mostly improbable ; the few previously reported cases, the experimental
bacterial neutropenias, the peculiar, transient, evolution we observed, all favor
a peripheral mechanism ; the bacterial infection seems to act by; two ways : in
septicemia (especially during septic shock) by enhancing leucocyte margination
along vascular walls ; in large septic foci (mostly pulmonary) by an important
destruction of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Such bacterial infections share a
bad prognosis but the neutropenia itself needs no specific treatment.
