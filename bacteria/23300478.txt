PhoQ/PhoP is a central two-component system involved in magnesium homeostasis,
pathogenicity, cell envelope composition, and acid resistance in several
bacterial species. The small RNA GcvB is identified here as a novel direct
regulator of the synthesis of PhoQ/PhoP in Escherichia coli, and this control
relies on a novel pairing region of GcvB. After MicA, this is the second
Hfq-dependent small RNA that represses expression of the phoPQ operon. Both MicA 
and GcvB bind phoPQ mRNA in vivo and in vitro around the translation initiation
region of phoP. Binding of either small RNA is sufficient to inhibit ribosome
binding and induce mRNA degradation. Surprisingly, however, MicA and GcvB have
different effects on the levels of the PhoP protein and therefore on the
expression of the PhoP regulon. These results highlight the complex connections
between small RNAs and transcriptional regulation networks in bacteria.
