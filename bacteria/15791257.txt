Natural killer T (NKT) cells constitute a highly conserved T lymphocyte
subpopulation that has the potential to regulate many types of immune responses
through the rapid secretion of cytokines. NKT cells recognize glycolipids
presented by CD1d, a class I-like antigen-presenting molecule. They have an
invariant T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) alpha-chain, but whether this invariant
TCR recognizes microbial antigens is still controversial. Here we show that most 
mouse and human NKT cells recognize glycosphingolipids from Sphingomonas,
Gram-negative bacteria that do not contain lipopolysaccharide. NKT cells are
activated in vivo after exposure to these bacterial antigens or bacteria, and
mice that lack NKT cells have a marked defect in the clearance of Sphingomonas
from the liver. These data suggest that NKT cells are T lymphocytes that provide 
an innate-type immune response to certain microorganisms through recognition by
their antigen receptor, and that they might be useful in providing protection
from bacteria that cannot be detected by pattern recognition receptors such as
Toll-like receptor 4.
