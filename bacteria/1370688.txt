Regulated adhesion enables T cells to migrate through tissue and transiently
interact with an endless succession of cells. Monoclonal antibody (mAb)
engagement of the CD3/T cell receptor (TCR) complex results in a rapid and
transient augmentation of the adhesion function of LFA-1 and VLA integrin
molecules on human T cells. We show in this study that mAb crosslinking of the T 
cell-specific accessory molecules CD7 and CD28, or treatment with the Ca2+
ionophore A23187, results in the rapid induction of integrin-mediated adhesion to
three distinct ligands: the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, and the
cell surface molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Like CD3 crosslinking, increased
adhesion via CD7 and CD28 crosslinking appears to involve both protein kinase C
(PKC) and cAMP-dependent protein kinases. In contrast, A23187 induction of
adhesion is unaffected by PKC inhibitors. CD7 is preferentially expressed on
naive T cells and is unique in being a potent inducer of naive T cell adhesion.
Enhanced expression/function of adhesion-inducing molecules thus overcomes
relative deficits in adhesion receptor expression.
