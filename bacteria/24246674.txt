Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) is a
vesicular sorting protein that functions as one of the endosomal-sorting proteins
required for transport (ESCRT). Hrs, which binds to ubiquitinated proteins
through its ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), contributes to the lysosomal
transport and degradation of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. However, little is 
known about the relationship between B-cell functions and ESCRT proteins in vivo.
Here we examined the immunological roles of Hrs in B-cell development and
functions using B-cell-specific Hrs-deficient
(Hrs(flox/flox);mb1(cre/)(+):Hrs-cKO) mice, which were generated using a cre-LoxP
recombination system. Hrs deficiency in B-cells significantly reduced
T-cell-dependent antibody production in vivo and impaired the proliferation of
B-cells treated in vitro with an anti-IgM monoclonal antibody but not with LPS.
Although early development of B-cells in the bone marrow was normal in Hrs-cKO
mice, there was a significant decrease in the number of the peripheral
transitional B-cells and marginal zone B-cells in the spleen of Hrs-cKO mice.
These results indicate that Hrs plays important roles during peripheral
development and physiological functions of B lymphocytes.
