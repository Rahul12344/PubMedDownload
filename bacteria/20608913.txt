BACKGROUND: The disrupted skin barrier of patients with atopic eczema (AE) might 
facilitate contact between mast cells (MCs) in the skin and environmental
triggers of the disease. One such trigger is the skin-colonizing yeast Malassezia
sympodialis (M. sympodialis). In this study, we investigated the interaction of
MC with M. sympodialis.
METHODS: Mast cells were generated from peripheral blood CD34(+) progenitor cells
of healthy controls (HC) and M. sympodialis-sensitized AE patients. Biopsy
specimens were taken from HC and lesional AE skin for immunohistological
stainings.
RESULTS: The progenitor-derived MCs expressed the macrophage-inducible C-type
lectin receptor Mincle, and exposure of these cells to M. sympodialis induced
up-regulation of the mRNA expression of Mincle. Furthermore, we demonstrate that,
when compared to HC, the progenitor-derived MCs from AE patients (i) contain more
intrinsic granule mediators such as histamine, (ii) exhibit enhanced IL-6 release
in response to M. sympodialis exposure, and (iii) have an impaired up-regulation 
of the fungal recognition receptor Dectin-1. In addition, analysis of skin
sections from HC and AE patients revealed MCs as the predominant
Dectin-1-expressing cell type in the skin.
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that progenitor-derived MCs from AE patients differ
from those from HC. Further investigations with skin-derived MCs are necessary to
confirm the observed differences which could provide new insights into the
pathogenic mechanisms underlying AE.
