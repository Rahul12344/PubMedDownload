The ring-shaped hexameric DnaB helicase unwinds duplex DNA at the replication
fork of eubacteria. We have solved the crystal structure of the full-length
Thermus aquaticus DnaB monomer, or possibly dimer, at 2.9 A resolution. DnaB is a
highly flexible two domain protein. The C-terminal domain exhibits a RecA-like
core fold and contains all the conserved sequence motifs that are characteristic 
of the DnaB helicase family. The N-terminal domain contains an additional helical
hairpin that makes it larger than previously appreciated. Several DnaB mutations 
that modulate its interaction with primase are found in this hairpin. The
similarity in the fold of the DnaB N-terminal domain with that of the C-terminal 
helicase-binding domain (HBD) of the DnaG primase also includes this hairpin.
Comparison of hexameric homology models of DnaB with the structure of the
papillomavirus E1 helicase suggests the two helicases may function through
different mechanisms despite their sharing a common ancestor.
