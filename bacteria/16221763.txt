The costimulatory ligands B7-1 and B7-2 are expressed on the surface of
antigen-presenting cells and interact with the costimulatory receptors CD28 and
cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) expressed on T cells.
Although B7-1 and B7-2 are homologous ligands having common receptors, they
exhibit distinct biochemical features and roles in immune regulation. Several
biochemical and structural studies have indicated differences in the oligomeric
state of B7-1 and B7-2. However, the organization of B7 ligands on the cell
surface has not been examined. By using photobleaching-based FRET (pbFRET), we
demonstrate that B7-1 and B7-2 adopt different oligomeric states on the cell
surface. Our study shows that B7-2 exists as a monomer on the cell surface
whereas B7-1 exists predominantly as dimers on the cell surface. A series of
mutations in B7-1 result in the expression of a predominantly monomeric species
on the cell surface and validate the dimer interface proposed by prior
crystallographic analysis. The difference in the oligomeric states of B7-1 and
B7-2 provides insight into the geometric organization of the costimulatory
receptor-ligand complexes in the immunological synapse and suggests constraints
on signal transduction mechanisms involved in T cell activation.
