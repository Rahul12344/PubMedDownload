INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to assess the circulating levels
of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other suggested therapeutic
growth factors with the degree of ischemia in patients with different clinical
manifestations of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) according to the Rutherford
grades.
METHODS: The study cohort consists of 226 consecutive patients admitted to a
Department of Vascular Surgery for elective invasive procedures. PAD patients
were grouped according to the Rutherford grades after a clinical assessment.
Ankle-brachial pressure indices (ABI) and absolute toe pressure (TP) values were 
measured. Serum levels of circulating VEGF, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) were
measured from serum and analysed against Rutherford grades and peripheral
hemodynamic measurements.
RESULTS: The levels of VEGF (P = 0.009) and HGF (P < 0.001) increased
significantly as the ischaemic burden became more severe according to the
Rutherford grades. PDGF behaved in opposite manner and declined along increasing 
Rutherford grades (P = 0.004). A significant, inverse correlations between
Rutherford grades was detected as follows; VEGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.183,
P = 0.004), HGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.253, P < 0.001), bFGF (Pearson's
correlation = 0.169, P = 0.008) and PDGF (Pearson's correlation = 0.296,
P < 0.001). In addition, VEGF had a clear direct negative correlation with ABI
(Pearson's correlation -0.19, P = 0.009) and TP (Pearson's correlation -0.20,
P = 0.005) measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present observations show that the circulating levels of VEGF
and other suggested therapeutic growth factors are significantly increased along 
with increasing ischemia. These findings present a new perspective to anticipated
positive effects of gene therapies utilizing VEGF, HGF, and bFGF, because the
levels of these growth factors are endogenously high in end-stage PAD.
