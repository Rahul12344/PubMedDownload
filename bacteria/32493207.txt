BACKGROUND: Bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO) develops in the
growth plate (GP) of the proximal femur and tibia and is initiated by damage to
the less mineralized chondrocytes followed by colonization of opportunistic
bacteria. This condition affects approximately 1% of all birds housed, being
considered one of the major causes of lameness in fast growing broilers. Although
several studies have been previously performed aiming to understand its
pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms involved with BCO remains to be
elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to generate a profile of global
differential gene expression involved with BCO in the tibia of commercial
broilers, through RNA sequencing analysis to identity genes and molecular
pathways involved with BCO in chickens.
RESULTS: Our data showed 192 differentially expressed (DE) genes: 63 upregulated 
and 129 downregulated in the GP of the tibia proximal epiphysis of BCO-affected
broilers. Using all DE genes, six Biological Processes (BP) were associated with 
bone development (connective tissue development, cartilage development, skeletal 
system development, organ morphogenesis, system development and skeletal system
morphogenesis). The analyses of the upregulated genes did not indicate any
significant BP (FDR < 0.05). However, with the downregulated genes, the same BP
were identified when using all DE genes in the analysis, with a total of 26
coding genes explaining BCO in the tibia: ACAN, ALDH1A2, CDH7, CHAD, CHADL,
COL11A1, COMP, CSGALNACT1, CYR61, FRZB, GAL3ST1, HAPLN1, IHH, KIF26B, LECT1,
LPPR1, PDE6B, RBP4A, SERINC5, SFRP1, SOX8, SOX9, TENM2, THBS1, UCHL1 and WFIKKN2.
In addition, seven transcription factors were also associated to BCO: NFATC2,
MAFB, HIF1A-ARNT, EWSR1-FLI1, NFIC, TCF3 and NF-KAPPAB.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that osteochondral downregulated genes are potential
molecular causes of BCO in broilers, and the bacterial process seems to be, in
fact, a secondary condition. Sixteen genes responsible for bone and cartilage
formation were downregulated in BCO-affected broilers being strong candidate
genes to trigger this disorder.
