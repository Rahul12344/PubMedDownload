Flavobacterium columnare is an aquatic bacterium that is responsible for
columnaris disease. This aquatic pathogen has a worldwide distribution and is
highly infectious to both warm and cold water fish. AÂ modified live F. columnare 
vaccine was developed by repeated passage of a virulent strain on increasing
concentrations of rifampicin that resulted in attenuation. Here we report
vaccination/challenge trials to evaluate efficacy and safety. In separate
laboratory trials, immersion vaccination of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)
fry between 10 to 48 days post hatch (DPH) with experimental vaccine or licensed 
product resulted in relative percent survival (RPS) between 57-94% following
challenge. Similarly, a vaccination/challenge trial using largemouth bass
(Micropterus salmoides) fry at 10 DPH was performed using various doses of
licensed product under laboratory conditions. Results demonstrated safety of the 
vaccine and significant protection following challenge with RPS values between
74-94%, depending on vaccine dose. Together, these trials demonstrate the vaccine
administered to early life-stage channel catfish and largemouth bass is safe and 
reduces mortality following challenge with F. columnare.
