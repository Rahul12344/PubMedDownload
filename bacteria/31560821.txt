A light-driven multifunctional Janus micromotor for the removal of bacterial
endotoxins and heavy metals is described. The micromotor was assembled by using
the biocompatible polymer polycaprolactone for the encapsulation of CdTe or
CdSe@ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as photoactive materials and an asymmetric Fe3 O4
patch for propulsion. The micromotors can be activated with visible light
(470-490 nm) to propel in peroxide or glucose media by a diffusiophoretic
mechanism. Efficient propulsion was observed for the first time in complex
samples such as human blood serum. These properties were exploited for efficient 
endotoxin removal using lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli O111:B4 as a
model toxin. The micromotors were also used for mercury removal by cationic
exchange with the CdSe@ZnS core-shell QDs. Cytotoxicity assays in HeLa cell lines
demonstrated the high biocompatibility of the micromotors for future
detoxification applications.
