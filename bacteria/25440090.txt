The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligands programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and PD-L2, members of the CD28 and B7 families, play critical roles in T 
cell coinhibition and exhaustion. Overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-1 on tumor cells
and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, respectively, correlates with poor disease
outcome in some human cancers. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blockading the
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway have been developed for cancer immunotherapy via enhancing T
cell functions. Clinical trials with mAbs to PD-1 and PD-L1 have shown impressive
response rates in patients, particularly for melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and bladder cancer. Further studies are
needed to dissect the mechanisms of variable response rate, to identify
biomarkers for clinical response, to develop small-molecule inhibitors, and to
combine these treatments with other therapies.
