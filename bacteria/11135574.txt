Although natural killer (NK) cells are known to preferentially kill cells that
lack major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, we do not know what
signals the attack of these targets. Several membrane receptors have recently
been implicated in this process and include molecules with immunoreceptor
tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAM) and motifs that bind phosphoinositide-3
kinase (PI3K). Evidence is emerging that NK cells may use a combination of
several receptors and signaling pathways to protect the host against infection
and possibly against malignancies.
