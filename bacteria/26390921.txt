BACKGROUND: Local trend (i.e. shape) analysis of time series data reveals
co-changing patterns in dynamics of biological systems. However, slow permutation
procedures to evaluate the statistical significance of local trend scores have
limited its applications to high-throughput time series data analysis, e.g., data
from the next generation sequencing technology based studies.
RESULTS: By extending the theories for the tail probability of the range of sum
of Markovian random variables, we propose formulae for approximating the
statistical significance of local trend scores. Using simulations and real data, 
we show that the approximate p-value is close to that obtained using a large
number of permutations (starting at time points >20 with no delay and >30 with
delay of at most three time steps) in that the non-zero decimals of the p-values 
obtained by the approximation and the permutations are mostly the same when the
approximate p-value is less than 0.05. In addition, the approximate p-value is
slightly larger than that based on permutations making hypothesis testing based
on the approximate p-value conservative. The approximation enables efficient
calculation of p-values for pairwise local trend analysis, making large scale
all-versus-all comparisons possible. We also propose a hybrid approach by
integrating the approximation and permutations to obtain accurate p-values for
significantly associated pairs. We further demonstrate its use with the analysis 
of the Polymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) microbial community time series from
high-throughput sequencing data and found interesting organism co-occurrence
dynamic patterns.
AVAILABILITY: The software tool is integrated into the eLSA software package that
now provides accelerated local trend and similarity analysis pipelines for time
series data. The package is freely available from the eLSA website:
