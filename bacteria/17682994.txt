Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infection has presented a global
medical challenge. The antibiograms of paired colistin-susceptible and -resistant
strains revealed increased susceptibility of colistin-resistant strains to most
tested antibiotics, including those that are active against only gram-positive
bacteria. Synergy between colistin and rifampicin was observed in the
colistin-susceptible strains. The ability to form biofilm in the
colistin-resistant strains was significantly lower (P<.001) than in the parent
strains. Our study provides valuable information for potential expansion of our
current therapeutic options against colistin-resistant A. baumannii infection.
