Leishmaniasis is a deadly vector-borne disease that causes significant morbidity 
and mortality in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Mediterranean regions. The
causative agent of leishmaniasis is transmitted from man to man by a tiny insect 
called sandfly. Approximately, 600 species of sandflies are known but only 10% of
these act as disease vectors. Further, only 30 species of these are important
from public health point. Fauna of Indian sub-zone is represented by 46 species, 
of these, 11 belong to Phlebotomine species and 35 to Sergentomyia species.
Phlebotomus argentipes is the proven vector of kala-azar or visceral
leishmaniasis in India. This review gives an insight into the insect vectors of
human leishmaniasis, their geographical distribution, recent taxonomic
classification, habitat, and different control measures including indoor residual
spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), environmental management,
biological control, and emerging resistance to DDT. Role of satellite remote
sensing for early prediction of the disease by identifying the sandflygenic
conditions cannot be undermined. The article also underlines the importance of
synthetic pheromones which can be used in near future for the control of these
vectors.
