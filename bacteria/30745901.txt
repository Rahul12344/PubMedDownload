Natural killer (NK) cell functions are modulated by polymorphic killer cell
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR). Among 13 human KIR genes, which vary by
presence and copy number, KIR3DL3 is ubiquitously present in every individual
across diverse populations. No ligand or function is known for KIR3DL3, but
limited knowledge of expression suggests involvement in reproduction, likely
during placentation. With 157 human alleles, KIR3DL3 is also highly polymorphic
and we show heterozygosity exceeds that of HLA-B in many populations. The
external domains of catarrhine primate KIR3DL3 evolved as a conserved lineage
distinct from other KIR. Accordingly, and in contrast to other KIR, we show the
focus of natural selection does not correspond exclusively to known ligand
binding sites. Instead, a strong signal for diversifying selection occurs in the 
D1 Ig domain at a site involved in receptor aggregation, which we show is
polymorphic in humans worldwide, suggesting differential ability for receptor
aggregation. Meanwhile in the cytoplasmic tail, the first of two inhibitory
tyrosine motifs (ITIM) is conserved, whereas independent genomic events have
mutated the second ITIM of KIR3DL3 alleles in all great apes. Together, these
findings suggest that KIR3DL3 binds a conserved ligand, and a function requiring 
both receptor aggregation and inhibitory signal attenuation. In this model
KIR3DL3 resembles other NK cell inhibitory receptors having only one ITIM, which 
interact with bivalent downstream signaling proteins through dimerization. Due to
the extensive conservation across species, selection, and other unusual
properties, we consider elucidating the ligand and function of KIR3DL3 to be a
pressing question.
