Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the energy currency of living cells. Even though 
ATP powers virtually all energy-dependent activities, most cellular ATP is
utilized in protein synthesis via tRNA aminoacylation and guanosine triphosphate 
regeneration. Magnesium (Mg(2+)), the most common divalent cation in living
cells, plays crucial roles in protein synthesis by maintaining the structure of
ribosomes, participating in the biochemistry of translation initiation and
functioning as a counterion for ATP. A non-physiological increase in ATP levels
hinders growth in cells experiencing Mg(2+) limitation because ATP is the most
abundant nucleotide triphosphate in the cell, and Mg(2+) is also required for the
stabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane and as a cofactor for essential
enzymes. We propose that organisms cope with Mg(2+) limitation by decreasing ATP 
levels and ribosome production, thereby reallocating Mg(2+) to indispensable
cellular processes.
