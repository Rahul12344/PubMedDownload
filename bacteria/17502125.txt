Organochlorine pesticides including hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are largely used in developing countries
like India for public health and agricultural purposes. Even though the
agricultural use of technical mixture (tech-HCH) is banned, countries like India 
are still using gamma-HCH for economic purposes. Thus, in addition to already
contaminated sites, new sites are being contaminated with gamma-HCH and its
stereoisomers. In the environment, these isomers have a half-life of 8-10 years. 
In our laboratory, we developed a microbial consortium capable of degrading
tech-HCH. Conditions such as induction, inoculum level, concentration of the
substrate, pH of degradation and interaction between isomers were optimized for
tech-HCH degradation. Up to 25 ppm tech-HCH was degraded at an inoculum level of 
100 microg protein/mL, pH 7.5 at ambient temperature (26-28 degrees C). The
degradation of HCH-isomers was in the order of gamma>alpha>beta>delta. The rate
of degradation was also determined.
