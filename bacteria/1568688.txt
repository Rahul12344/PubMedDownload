A 42-year-old man developed giant fold gastritis that was associated with massive
Helicobacter pylori colonization, highly active, high-grade gastritis and severe 
hypoproteinemia with gastric protein-loss syndrome. Histology revealed marked
focal foveolar hyperplasia of the body and fundic mucosa. Combination treatment
with amoxicillin and omeprazole resulted in the eradication of the Helicobacter
pylori. Concomitantly, the foveolar hyperplasia, gastritis and the giant folds
regressed completely, and the protein loss was arrested. It would appear highly
likely that colonization with Helicobacter pylori had led to the formation of the
giant folds and to gastric protein loss. The clinical picture described here
mimics Ménétrier's disease, the cause of which is still unknown, and possibly
represents a subgroup of this heterogeneous clinical entity.
