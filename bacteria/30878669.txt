OBJECTIVES: The objective of this work was to provide detailed molecular data on 
clinically acquired AmpC (qAmpC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae from two different 
periods (2002-2008 and 2010-2013) in order to clarify the contribution of clonal 
and plasmid genetic platforms for the current epidemiological scenario concerning
extended-spectrum beta-lactams resistance.
METHODS: We analysed 1246 Enterobacteriaceae non-susceptible to third-generation 
cephalosporins from two hospitals and one community laboratory between 2010 and
2013. Bacterial identification, antibiotic susceptibility, identification of
qAmpC and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, clonal (pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE), Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)) and plasmid
(S1-/I-CeuI-PFGE, replicon typing, hybridization) analysis were performed by
standard methods. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in two
ST11-Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harbouring DHA-1.
RESULTS: The occurrence of qAmpC was lower (2.6%) than that observed in a
previous survey (7.4%), and varied slightly over time. Isolates produced DHA-1
(53%), CMY-2 (44%) or DHA-6 (3%), but significant epidemiological changes were
observed in the two surveys. While DHA-1 persisted in different institutions by
selection of a worldwide epidemic IncR plasmid in an ST11 harbouring KL105, CMY-2
rates increased over time linked to IncI1 plasmids (instead of IncK or IncA/C2)
in multiple Escherichia coli clones.
CONCLUSIONS: The higher frequency of DHA-1 qAmpC in these species contrasts with 
the scenario in most European countries. Furthermore, the different genetic
backgrounds associated with either extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) or
acquired AmpC β-lactamases (qAmpC) in our country might have contributed to their
differential expansion.
