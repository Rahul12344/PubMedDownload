CTLA-4, a CD28 homologue expressed on activated T cells, binds with high affinity
to the CD28 ligands, B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). This study was designed to
examine the role of CTLA-4 in regulating autoimmune disease. Murine
relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) is a
demyelinating disease mediated by PLP139-151-specific CD4+ T cells in SJL/J mice.
Anti-CTLA-4 mAbs (or their F(ab) fragments) enhanced in vitro proliferation and
pro-inflammatory cytokine production by PLP139-151-primed lymph node cells.
Addition of either reagent to in vitro activation cultures potentiated the
ability of T cells to adoptively transfer disease to naive recipients. In vivo
administration of anti-CTLA-4 mAb to recipients of PLP139-151-specific T cells
resulted in accelerated and exacerbated disease. Finally, anti-CTLA-4 treatment
of mice during disease remission resulted in the exacerbation of relapses.
Collectively, these results suggest that CTLA-4 mediates the downregulation of
ongoing immune responses and plays a major role in regulating autoimmunity.
