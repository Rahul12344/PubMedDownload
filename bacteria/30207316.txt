Antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a major health concern. Antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) are a class of peptides that are efficient in killing most
microbes yet development of resistance to AMPs is rare. However, complex
secondary and tertiary structures and difficulties in isolating AMPs have limited
their use as antibiotics. It has been demonstrated earlier that small peptides
derived from human β defensin-3 (HBD-3) also show antibacterial activity. Here,
we perform a detailed characterization of the antibacterial activity of one such 
derivative: CHRG01. While HBD-3 has 45 amino acids with three disulphide bonds
and a β-sheet folded structure, CHRG01 has only 14 amino acids with the cysteine 
residues replaced by serine. The antibacterial nature of CHRG01 was studied using
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal microscopy, circular dichroism (CD) 
and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). CD data show that CHRG01 is random
coiled in solution. SEM and confocal studies show that the mode of action of
CHRG01 is pore forming. SAXS studies show that CHRG01 induces a negative Gaussian
curvature, the type of curvature needed for pore formation. The above results
show that CHRG01, a small peptide without any complex structure, is capable of
killing bacteria by permeabilizing their outer membranes.
