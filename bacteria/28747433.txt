TsrM catalyzes the methylation of C2 in l-tryptophan (Trp). This reaction is the 
first step in the biosynthesis of the quinaldic acid moiety of the thiopeptide
antibiotic thiostrepton, which exhibits potent activity against Gram-positive
pathogens. TsrM is a member of the radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) superfamily
of enzymes, but it does not catalyze the formation of 5'-deoxyadenosin-5'-yl or
any other SAM-derived radical. In addition to a [4Fe-4S] cluster, TsrM contains a
cobalamin cofactor that serves as an intermediate methyl carrier in its reaction.
However, how this cofactor donates a methyl moiety to the Trp substrate is
unknown. Here, we showed that the unmodified N1 position of Trp is important for 
turnover and that 1-thia-Trp and 1-oxa-Trp serve as competitive inhibitors. We
also showed that β-cyclopropyl-Trp undergoes C2 methylation in the absence of
cyclopropyl ring opening, disfavoring mechanisms that involve unpaired electron
density at C3 of the indole ring. Moreover, we showed that all other
indole-substituted analogs of Trp undergo methylation at varying but measurable
rates and that the analog 7-aza-Trp, which is expected to temper the
nucleophilicity of C2 in Trp, is a very poor substrate. Last, no formation of
cob(II)alamin or substrate radicals was observed during the reaction with Trp or 
any molecule within a tested panel of Trp analogs. In summary, our results are
most consistent with a mechanism that involves two polar nucleophilic
displacements, the second of which requires deprotonation of the indole nitrogen 
in Trp during its attack on methylcobalamin.
