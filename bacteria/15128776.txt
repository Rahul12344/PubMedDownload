Abs or their recombinant fragments against surface receptors of the Ig
superfamily can induce or block the receptors' native function depending on
whether they induce or prevent the assembly of signalosomes on their cytoplasmic 
tails. In this study, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the observation that
a bispecific tandem single-chain variable region fragment ligand of CTLA-4 by
itself converts this inhibitory receptor into an activating receptor for primary 
human T lymphocytes. This reversal of function results from increased recruitment
of the serine/threonine phosphatase 2A to the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4,
consistent with a role of this phosphatase in the regulation of CTLA-4 function, 
and assembly of a distinct signalosome that activates an lck-dependent signaling 
cascade and induces IL-2 production. Our data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic
domain of CTLA-4 has an inherent plasticity for signaling that can be exploited
therapeutically with recombinant ligands for this receptor.
