Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) successfully identified various
chromosomal regions to be associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). The primary
aim of this study was to replicate reported associations from GWAS using an exome
array in a large German study. German MS cases (n = 4,476) and German controls (n
= 5,714) were genotyped using the Illumina HumanExome v1-Chip. Genotype calling
was performed with the Illumina Genome Studio(TM) Genotyping Module, followed by 
zCall. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven regions outside the human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) region showed genome-wide significant associations with
MS (P values < 5 × 10(-8) ). These associations have been reported previously. In
addition, SNPs in three previously reported regions outside the HLA region
yielded P values < 10(-5) . The effect of nine SNPs in the HLA region remained (P
< 10(-5) ) after adjustment for other significant SNPs in the HLA region. All of 
these findings have been reported before or are driven by known risk loci. In
summary, findings from previous GWAS for MS could be successfully replicated. We 
conclude that the regions identified in previous GWAS are also associated in the 
German population. This reassures the need for detailed investigations of the
functional mechanisms underlying the replicated associations.
