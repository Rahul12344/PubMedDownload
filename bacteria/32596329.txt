Successful dental implants rely on stable osseointegration and soft-tissue
integration. Titania nanotubes (TNTs) with a diameter of 100 nm could increase
the mesenchymal stem cell response and simultaneously decrease Staphylococcus
aureus adhesion. However, the interactions between the modified surface and
surrounding soft tissues are still unknown. In the present study, we fully
investigated the biological behavior of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and the
adhesion of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis). TNTs were synthesized on
titanium (Ti) surfaces by electrochemical anodization at 10, 30, and 60 V, and
the products were denoted as NT10, NT30, and NT60, respectively. NT10 (diameter: 
30 nm) and NT30 (diameter: 100 nm) could enhance the HGF functions, such as cell 
attachment and proliferation and extracellular matrix- (ECM-) related gene
expressions, with the latter showing higher enhancement. NT60 (diameter: 200 nm) 
clearly impaired cell adhesion and proliferation and ECM-related gene
expressions. Bacterial adhesion on the TNTs decreased and reached the lowest
value on NT30. Therefore, NT30 without pharmaceuticals can be used to
substantially enhance the HGF response and reduce P. gingivalis adhesion to the
utmost, thus demonstrating significant potential in the transgingival part of
dental implants.
