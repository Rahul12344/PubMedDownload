The mouse CD1d1 glycoprotein is specialized in presenting lipid antigens to a
novel class of T cells called natural killer T (NKT) cells. CD1d1 is predicted to
contain five potential N-linked glycosylation sites (asparagine residues at
positions 25, 38, 60, 128, and 183). Glycosylation has been shown to invariably
affect the molecular and functional properties of various glycoproteins, and in
the current report it was found that a conservative change of the individual
endogenous asparagine residues in CD1d1 to glutamine differentially affected its 
functional expression. Although the maturation rate of the glycosylation mutants 
was comparable to that of wild type, they differed in their relative levels of
surface expression and in their ability to stimulate NKT cells. Mutating all five
glycosylation residues resulted in the absence of detectable CD1d1 expression,
with a concomitant lack of NKT cell activation. Therefore, these results
demonstrate that glycosylation plays a significant role in the functional
expression of CD1d1.
