Flavobacterium psychrophilum, the etiological agent of rainbow trout fry syndrome
and bacterial cold-water disease in salmonid fish, is currently one of the main
bacterial pathogens hampering the productivity of salmonid farming worldwide. In 
this study, the genomic diversity of the F. psychrophilum species is analyzed
using a set of 41 genomes, including 30 newly sequenced isolates. These were
selected on the basis of available MLST data with the two-fold objective of
maximizing the coverage of the species diversity and of allowing a focus on the
main clonal complex (CC-ST10) infecting farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus
mykiss) worldwide. The results reveal a bacterial species harboring a limited
genomic diversity both in terms of nucleotide diversity, with ~0.3% nucleotide
divergence inside CDSs in pairwise genome comparisons, and in terms of gene
repertoire, with the core genome accounting for ~80% of the genes in each genome.
The pan-genome seems nevertheless "open" according to the scaling exponent of a
power-law fitted on the rate of new gene discovery when genomes are added
one-by-one. Recombination is a key component of the evolutionary process of the
species as seen in the high level of apparent homoplasy in the core genome. Using
a Hidden Markov Model to delineate recombination tracts in pairs of closely
related genomes, the average recombination tract length was estimated to ~4.0 Kbp
and the typical ratio of the contributions of recombination and mutations to
nucleotide-level differentiation (r/m) was estimated to ~13. Within CC-ST10,
evolutionary distances computed on non-recombined regions and comparisons between
22 isolates sampled up to 27 years apart suggest a most recent common ancestor in
the second half of the nineteenth century in North America with subsequent
diversification and transmission of this clonal complex coinciding with the
worldwide expansion of rainbow trout farming. With the goal to promote the
development of tools for the genetic manipulation of F. psychrophilum, a
particular attention was also paid to plasmids. Their extraction and sequencing
to completion revealed plasmid diversity that remained hidden to classical
plasmid profiling due to size similarities.
