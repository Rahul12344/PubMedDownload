BACKGROUND: Most biological samples are cell mixtures. Some basic questions are
still unanswered about analyzing these heterogeneous samples using gene
expression microarray technology (MAT). How meaningful is a cell mixture's
overall gene expression profile (GEP)? Is it necessary to purify the cells of
interest before microarray analysis, and how much purity is needed? How much does
the purification itself distort the GEP, and how well can the GEP of a small cell
subset be recovered?
METHODS: Model cell mixtures with different cell ratios were analyzed by both
spotted and Affymetrix MAT. GEP distortion during cell purification and GEPs of
purified cells were studied. CD34+ cord blood cells were purified and analyzed by
MAT.
RESULTS: GEPs for mixed cell populations were found to mirror the cell ratios in 
the mixture. Over 75% pure samples were indistinguishable from pure cells by
their overall GEP. Cell purification preserved the GEP. The GEPs of small cell
subsets could be accurately recovered by cell sorting both from model cell
mixtures and from cord blood.
CONCLUSIONS: Purification of small cell subsets from a mixture prior to MAT is
necessary for meaningful results. Even completely hidden GEPs of small cell
subpopulations can be recovered by cell sorting.
