The induction of tolerance to transplanted organs is a major objective in
transplantation immunology research. Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1
(LFA-1) interactions have been identified as a key component of the T-cell
activation process that may be interrupted to lead to allograft tolerance. In
mice, αLFA-1 mAb is a potent monotherapy that leads to the induction of
donor-specific transferable tolerance. By interrogating important adaptive and
innate immunity pathways, we demonstrate that the induction of tolerance relies
on CD8+T-cells. We further demonstrate that αLFA-1 induced tolerance is
associated with CD8+CD28-T-cells with a suppressor phenotype, and that while CD8 
cells are present, the effector T-cell response is abrogated. A recent
publication has shown that CD8+CD28- cells are not diminished by cyclosporine or 
rapamycin, therefore CD8+CD28- cells represent a clinically relevant population. 
To our knowledge, this is the first time that a mechanism for αLFA-1 induced
tolerance has been described.
