The reductive dechlorination and behavior of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(p,p'-DDT) was investigated in a paddy soil. Treatment with 5% (w/w) metallic
iron (Fe(0)) resulted in sharp decrease of p,p'-DDT, whereas there was no extra
effect when 2% (w/w) aluminum sulfate (Al(2)(SO(4))(3)) was added to the Fe(0)
treatment. These results suggest that Fe(0) could effectively promote the
reductive dechlorination of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites while Al(2)(SO(4))(3)
did not show any effect on those processes. Furthermore, p,p'-DDT and its
daughter compounds inhibited holistic soil respiration greatly at first but could
be metabolized by certain species of indigenous microorganisms after a period of 
adaptation time in the soil. When treated with Fe(0), the polluted soil produced 
much less CO(2) while the addition of Al(2)(SO(4))(3) counteracted its negative
effect to much extent.
