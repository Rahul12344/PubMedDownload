Three different multihaem cytochromes c were purified from cell extracts of the
hyperthermophilic archaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis. One tetrahaem cytochrome, locus
tag designation Igni_0530, was purified from membrane fractions together with the
iron-sulfur protein Igni_0529. Two octahaem cytochromes, Igni_0955 and Igni_1359,
were purified from soluble fractions but were also present in the membrane
fraction. N-terminal sequencing showed that three of the four proteins had their 
signal peptides cleaved off, while results were ambiguous for Igni_0955. In
contrast, mass spectrometry of Igni_0955 and Igni_1359 resulted in single mass
peaks including the signal sequences and eight haems per subunit and so both
forms might be present in the cell. Igni_0955 and Igni_1359 belong to the
hydroxylamine dehydrogenase (HAO) family (29 % mutual identity). HAO or reductase
activities with inorganic sulfur compounds were not detected. Igni_0955 was
reduced by enriched I. hospitalis hydrogenase at a specific activity of 243 nmol 
min(-1) (mg hydrogenase)(-1) while activity was non-existent for Igni_0530 and
low for Igni_1359. Immuno-electron microscopy of ultra-thin sections showed that 
Igni_0955 and Igni_1359 are located in both I. hospitalis membranes and also in
the intermembrane compartment. We concluded that these cytochromes might function
as electron shuttles between the hydrogenase in the outer cellular membrane and
cellular reductases, whereas Igni_0530 might be part of the sulfur-reducing
mechanism.
