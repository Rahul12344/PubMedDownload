We report complete genome sequences of four blaNDM-1-harboring Gram-negative
multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates from Colombia. The blaNDM-1 genes were located
on 193-kb Inc FIA, 178-kb Inc A/C2, and 47-kb (unknown Inc type) plasmids.
Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed that these isolates belong to sequence
type 10 (ST10) (Escherichia coli), ST392 (Klebsiella pneumoniae), and ST322 and
ST464 (Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis, respectively). Our
analysis identified that the Inc A/C2 plasmid in E. coli contained a novel
complex transposon (Tn125 and Tn5393 with three copies of blaNDM-1) and a
recombination "hot spot" for the acquisition of new resistance determinants.
