Photosystem I (PSI) of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis sp.
TS-821 (TS-821) forms tetramers Li et al. (2014). Two-dimensional maps obtained
by single particle electron microscopy (EM) clearly show that the tetramer lacks 
four-fold symmetry and is actually composed of a dimer of dimers with C2
symmetry. The resolution of these negative stain 2D maps did not permit the
placement of most of the small PSI subunits, except for PsaL. Therefore cryo-EM
was used for 3D reconstruction of the PSI tetramer complex. A 3D model at ~11.5Å 
resolution was obtained and a 2D map within the membrane plane of ~6.1Å. This
data was used to build a model that was compared with the high-resolution
structure of the PSI of Thermosynechococcus elongatus (T. elongatus) at 2.5Å.
This comparison reveals key differences in which subunits are involved in the two
different interfaces, interface type 1 within a dimer and interface type 2
between dimers. The type 1 interface in TS-821 is similar to the monomer
interface in the trimeric PSI from T. elongatus, with interactions between
subunits PsaA, -B, -I, -L and M. In type 2 the interaction is only between PsaA, 
-B and -L. Unlike the trimeric PSI, the central cavity of the complex is not
filled with the PsaL-derived helical bundle, but instead seems filled with
lipids. The physiological or evolutionary advantage of the tetramer is unknown.
However, the presence of both dimers and tetramers in the thylakoid membrane
suggest a dynamic equilibrium that shifts towards the tetramers in high light.
