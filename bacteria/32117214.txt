Vibrio anguillarum causes high mortality in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus
labrax) larviculture and is a hindering factor for successful sustainable
aquaculture of this commercially valuable species. Priming of the innate immune
system through administration of immunostimulants has become an important
approach to control disease outbreaks in marine fish larviculture. This study was
conducted to evaluate immunostimulation by Escherichia coli HSP70 (DnaK) in
axenic European sea bass larvae in order to protect the larvae against vibriosis.
DnaK stimulates the immune response in crustaceans and juvenile fish against
bacterial infections. The use of axenic fish larvae allows to study
immunostimulation in the absence of an interfering microbial community. At 7 days
post-hatching, larvae received a single dose of alginate encapsulated recombinant
DnaK. Two non-treated control groups in which animals either received empty
alginate microparticles (C1) or no alginante microparticles (C2 and C3) were
included in the study. Eighteen hours later, all larvae, except the ones from
group C3 (non-infected control) were challenged with V. anguillarum (105 CFU,
bath infection). Mortality was daily recorded until 120 h post infection and at
18, 24, and 36 h post infection, larvae were sampled for expression of immune
related genes. Results showed that V. anguillarum induced an immune response in
axenic sea bass larvae but that the innate immune response was incapable to
protect the larvae against deadly septicaemic disease. In addition, we showed
that administration of alginate encapsulated DnaK to axenic European sea bass
larvae at DAH7 resulted in a significant, DnaK dose dependent, upreglation of
immune sensor, regulatory and effector genes. Significant upregulation of cxcr4, 
cas1 and especially of hep and dic was correlated with significant higher
survival rates in V. anguillarum infected larvae. In the future recombinant DnaK 
might perhaps be used as a novel immunostimulant in sea bass larviculture.
