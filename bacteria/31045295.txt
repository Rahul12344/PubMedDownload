Fat-tailed sheep have a unique characteristic of depositing fat in their tails.
In the present study, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on
traits related to tail fat deposition and body size in the Hulun Buir sheep. A
total number of 300 individuals belonging to two fat-tailed lines of the Hulun
Buir sheep breed genotyped with the Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip were included 
in the current study. Two mixed models, one for continuous and one for binary
phenotypic traits, were employed to analyse ten traits, that is, body length
(BL), body height (BH), chest girth (CG), tail length (TL), tail width (TW), tail
circumference (TC), carcass weight (CW), tail fat weight (TF), ratio of CW to TF 
(RCT) and tail type (TT). We identified 7, 6, 7, 2, 10 and 1 SNPs significantly
associated with traits TF, CW, RCT, TW, TT and CG, respectively. Their associated
genomic regions harboured 42 positional candidate genes. Out of them, 13
candidate genes including SMURF2, FBF1, DTNBP1, SETD7 and RBM11 have been
associated with fat metabolism in sheep. The RBM11 gene has already been
identified in a previous study on signatures of selection in this specific sheep 
population. Two more genes, that is, SMARCA5 and GAB1 were associated with body
size in sheep. The present study has identified candidate genes that might be
implicated in tail fat deposition and body size in sheep.
