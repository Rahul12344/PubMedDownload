Systemic infusion of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), a major type of
multipotent stromal cells, produces pain relief (antihyperalgesia) that lasts for
months. However, studies have shown that the majority of BMSCs are trapped in the
lungs immediately after intravenous infusion and their survival time in the host 
is inconsistent with their lengthy antihyperalgesia. Here we show that
long-lasting antihyperalgesia produced by BMSCs required their chemotactic
factors such as CCL4 and CCR2, the integrations with the monocytes/macrophages
population, and BMSC-induced monocyte CXCL1. The activation of central mu-opioid 
receptors related to CXCL1-CXCR2 signaling plays an important role in
BMSC-produced antihyperalgesia. Our findings suggest that the maintenance of
antihypergesia can be achieved by immune regulation without actual engraftment of
BMSCs. In the capacity of therapeutic use of BMSCs other than structural repair
and replacement, more attention should be directed to their role as immune
modulators and subsequent alterations in the immune system.
