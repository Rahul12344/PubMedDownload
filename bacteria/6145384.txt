Expression of K99 pilus of E. coli.

Different factors are involved in production and (or) detection of K99. They are 
modifications in plasmid contents of the strains, the size of capsular antigens, 
the quantity of K99 protein produced according to the culture media. We made a
distinction between the strains which produced K99 on Minca medium without
glucose (K99-C) and those which needed glucose for production on this medium
(K99-GD). The K99-GD strains were able to use adonitol and most K99-C strains did
not. With strains K99-C we showed that heavily capsulated colonies produced as
much K99 than non capsulated colonies, but heavily capsulated ones were hardly
detected with slide agglutination. According to the carbon substrate, differences
were observed in K99 production. Mannose was a bad carbon source for K99
production, the synthesis of which was completely inhibited with K99-GD strains, 
but not with K99-C strains. Adonitol was a good substrate for detection of K99
from K99-GD strains. Measure of intracellular AMPc showed that there was non
catabolite repression for K99 biosynthesis. In the opposite, high intracellular
level of AMPc was correlated with a low production of K99. Plasmid contents of
the strains indicated that most strains had one or two plasmids in the range of
50-70 megadaltons. Small differences in plasmids are sometimes correlated with
modifications in the quantity of K99 produced. The main conclusions were that the
distinctions that we proposed between K99-C and K99-GD could help understand the 
mechanisms of K99 production.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
