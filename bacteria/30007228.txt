The discovery of heat shock protein 16 kDa antigen protein has deepen the
understanding of latent tuberculosis since it was found to be primarily expressed
by Mycobacterium tuberculosis during latent phase leading to the rapid
optimization and development in terms of diagnosis and therapeutics. Recently, T 
cell receptor-like antibody has been explored extensively targeting various
diseases due to its dual functionality (T cell receptor and antibody). In this
study, a TCR-like domain antibody (A2/Ab) with the binding capacity to Mtb heat
shock protein (HSP) 16 kDa antigen presented by major histocompatible complex
(MHC) HLA-A*02 was successfully generated via biopanning against human domain
antibody library. The generated antibody (A2/Ab) exhibited strong functionality
and binding capacity against the target assuring the findings of this study to be
beneficial for the development of latent tuberculosis diagnosis and
immunotherapeutics in future.
