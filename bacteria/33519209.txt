Introduction: Quiescent leukemia stem cells (LSCs) play a major role in
therapeutic resistance and disease progression of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
LSCs belong to the primitive population; CD34+CD38-Lin-, which does not
distinguish normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) from CML LSCs. Because
Thomsen-Friedenreich/CD176 antigen is expressed on CD34+ HSC and IL1RAP is
tightly correlated to BCR-ABL expression, we sought to increase the specificity
towards LSC by using additional biomarkers.
Methods: We evaluated the co-expression of both antigens on CD34+ peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from both healthy volunteers and CML patients,
using flow cytometry. Then, we used site-directed mutagenesis to induce
knob-in-hole mutations in the human IgG heavy chain and the human lambda light
chain to generate the bi-specific antibody (Bis-Ab) TF/RAP that binds both
antigens simultaneously. We measured complement-directed cytotoxicity (CDC) in
CML samples with the Bis-Ab by flow cytometry.
Results: In contrast to healthy volunteers, CML samples displayed a highly
significant co-expression of CD176 and IL1RAP. When either a double-positive cell
line or CML samples were treated with increasing doses of Bis-Ab, increased
binding and CDC was observed indicating co-operative binding of the Bis-Ab as
compared to monoclonal antibodies.
Discussion: These results show that the bi-specific antibody is capable of
targeting IL1RAP+ and CD176+ cell population among CML PBMCs, but not
corresponding normal cells in CDC assay. We hereby offer a novel strategy for the
depletion of CML stem cells from the bulk population in clinical hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation.
