Vaccination has been widely used to reduce the Salmonella burden in poultry and
subsequently the transmission to humans. Concerning turkey, there is little
knowledge on the immune response to colonization and invasion by Salmonella
species or about efficacy of vaccination and involved immune mechanisms. In the
present study, turkeys were vaccinated at the day of hatch and infected with
Salmonella Typhimurium (ST) or Enteritidis (SE) field strains three weeks later. 
A control group was kept uninfected. After challenge infection, bacterial counts 
in the cecal content, liver and spleen were determined 7 and 14days post
infection. They were often statistically significantly lower in vaccinated poults
than in non-vaccinated ones. Production of iNOS, and the cytokines IL-8, IL-10
and IFN-γ were reduced in vaccinated birds. However, neither the influx of CD4+, 
CD8α+ and CD28+ cells into cecal mucosa after infection nor the antibody response
were statistically significantly altered in vaccinated birds.
