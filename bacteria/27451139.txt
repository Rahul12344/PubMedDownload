BACKGROUND: Several PSMA-PSA prostate clones have been identified during prostate
cancer progression; however, until now, their in situ inflammatory
characteristics have remained unclear.
AIM: We therefore investigated the interplay between proinflammatory cytokines
and (PSMA,PSA) sub-groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 27 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and 18 prostate
cancers (PC) were enrolled in this study. Immunohistochemical analysis was
performed. Serum levels of PSA were assayed by Immulite autoanalyser.
RESULTS: In BPH and PC patients with elevated serum PSA levels, IL-1α was the
most proinflammatory cytokine expressed in (PSMA+,PSA-) subgroup. However, most
samples of (PSMA+,PSA+) subgroup had positive immunoreaction to IL-6. In samples 
of PC with PSA serum levels of 4-20ng/mL or >20ng/mL, immunoreaction to TNF-α was
seen only in (PSMA+,PSA+) subgroup. Interestingly, several combinations of
proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1α and TNF-α) showed that coexpression of
tissue PSMA and PSA was concomitant with high immunoreactions to (IL-6+,TNF-α-), 
(IL-6+,IL-1α+) and (IL-1α+,TNFα-) in BPH and PC patients. (PSMA,PSA) subgroup
lacking tissue PSA expression showed a high immunoexpression of the profile
(IL-6+,TNF-α-). The combinations of (IL-6-, TNF-α-) and (IL-6-, IL-1α-) were
absent in (PSMA+,PSA-) and (PSMA+,PSA+) BPH sub-groups.
CONCLUSION: Collectively, these findings underscore the importance of TNF-α and
highlight the interaction between IL-6 and IL-1α to generate an inflammatory
microenvironment in driving (PSMA,PSA) prostate clones.
