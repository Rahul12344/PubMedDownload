Centrosomes are conserved organelles that are essential for accurate cell
division and cilium formation. A centrosome consists of a pair of centrioles
surrounded by a protein network of pericentriolar material (PCM) that is
essential for the centrosome's function. In this study, we show that Sas-4
provides a scaffold for cytoplasmic complexes (named S-CAP), which include CNN,
Asl and D-PLP, proteins that are all found in the centrosomes at the vicinity of 
the centriole. When Sas-4 is absent, nascent procentrioles are unstable and lack 
PCM, and functional centrosomes are not generated. When Sas-4 is mutated, so that
it cannot form S-CAP complexes, centrosomes are present but with dramatically
reduced levels of PCM. Finally, purified S-CAP complexes or recombinant Sas-4 can
bind centrosomes stripped of PCM, whereas recombinant CNN or Asl cannot. In
summary, PCM assembly begins in the cytosol where Sas-4 provides a scaffold for
pre-assembled cytoplasmic complexes before tethering of the complexes in a
centrosome.
