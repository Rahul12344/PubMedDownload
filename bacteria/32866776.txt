The DNA damage response (DDR) is necessary to maintain genome integrity and
prevent the accumulation of oncogenic mutations. Consequently, proteins involved 
in the DDR often serve as tumor suppressors, carrying out the crucial task of
keeping DNA fidelity intact. Mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) is a
scaffold protein involved in the early steps of the DDR. MDC1 interacts directly 
with γ-H2AX, the phosphorylated form of H2AX, a commonly used marker for DNA
damage. It then propagates the phosphorylation of H2AX by recruiting ATM kinase. 
While the function of MDC1 in the DDR has been reviewed previously, its role in
cancer has not been reviewed, and numerous studies have recently identified a
link between MDC1 and carcinogenesis. This includes MDC1 functioning as a tumor
suppressor, with its loss serving as a biomarker for cancer and contributor to
drug sensitivity. Studies also indicate that MDC1 operates outside of its
traditional role in DDR, and functions as a co-regulator of nuclear receptor
transcriptional activity, and that mutations in MDC1 are present in tumors and
can also cause germline predisposition to cancer. This review will discuss
reports that link MDC1 to cancer and identify MDC1 as an important player in
tumor formation, progression, and treatment. We also discuss mechanisms by which 
MDC1 levels are regulated and how this contributes to tumor formation.
