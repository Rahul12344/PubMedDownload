Different dendritic cell (DC) subsets co-exist in humans and coordinate the
immune response. Having a short life, DCs must be constantly replenished from
their progenitors in the bone marrow through hematopoiesis. Identification of a
DC-restricted progenitor in mouse has improved our understanding of how DC
lineage diverges from myeloid and lymphoid lineages. However, identification of
the DC-restricted progenitor in humans has not been possible because a system
that simultaneously nurtures differentiation of human DCs, myeloid and lymphoid
cells, is lacking. Here we report a cytokine and stromal cell culture that allows
evaluation of CD34(+) progenitor potential to all three DC subsets as well as
other myeloid and lymphoid cells, at a single cell level. Using this system, we
show that human granulocyte-macrophage progenitors are heterogeneous and contain 
restricted progenitors to DCs.
