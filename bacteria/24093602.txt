INTRODUCTION: Reduced monocyte human leukocyte antigen (mHLA)-DR surface
expression in the late phase of sepsis is postulated as a general biomarker of
sepsis-induced immunosuppression and an independent predictor of nosocomial
infections.
METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with sepsis and blood culture growing pathogenic
bacteria were studied. Blood samples were collected at day 1 or 2 after
admission, for measurement of mHLA-DR by flow cytometry and mRNA expression of
HLA-DRA and class II transactivator (CIITA) by qRT-PCR. Blood samples from blood 
donors were used as controls (n = 30).
RESULTS: A significant reduced expression of mHLA-DR, HLA-DRA, and CIITA was seen
in septic patients compared with controls. HLA-DRA mRNA level in whole blood was 
highly correlated with surface expression of mHLA-DR.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sepsis display a diminished expression of HLA-DR at
the monocyte surface as well as in the gene expression at the mRNA level. The
mRNA expression level of HLA-DRA monitored by qRT-PCR correlates highly with
surface expression of HLA-DR and appears to be a possible future biomarker for
evaluation of immunosuppression in sepsis.
