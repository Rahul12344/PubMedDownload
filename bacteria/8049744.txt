Authors report on experiences gained with the treatment of 22 cases of
osteomyelitis of the fibula in the 17 years material of their Department. It is
stated that the fibula osteomyelitis has to be treated first of all with
operation and the end results of the treatment are good. In this, the anatomical 
situation which enables the resection and removal of the proximal part of this
bone without more ado has a role. The more frequent occurrence of the disease on 
the right fibula in their material is an accidental finding.
