Suppression of inflammation is critical for effective therapy of many infectious 
diseases. However, the high rates of mortality caused by sepsis attest to the
need to better understand the basis of the inflammatory sequelae of sepsis and to
develop new options for its treatment. In mice, inflammatory responses to host
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), but not to microbial
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), are repressed by the interaction 
[corrected] of CD24 and SiglecG (SIGLEC10 in human). Here we use an intestinal
perforation model of sepsis to show that microbial sialidases target the sialic
acid-based recognition of CD24 by SiglecG/10 to exacerbate inflammation.
Sialidase inhibitors protect mice against sepsis by a mechanism involving both
CD24 and Siglecg, whereas mutation of either gene exacerbates sepsis. Analysis of
sialidase-deficient bacterial mutants confirms the key contribution of disrupting
sialic acid-based pattern recognition to microbial virulence and supports the
clinical potential of sialidase inhibition for dampening inflammation caused by
infection.
