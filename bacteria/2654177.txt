T lymphocytes from a patient with Shigella flexneri dysentery and postdysenteric 
reactive arthritis were cloned by limiting dilution with recombinant
interleukin-2 and a strain of S. flexneri different from that which had infected 
her. Five of eight clones produced proliferated in response to the shigellae used
to generate the clones. The response required irradiated syngeneic blood
mononuclear cells as antigen-presenting cells. One such clone, MC12, proliferated
in response to both the shigellae used to generate the clones and the infecting
shigellae but not to other shigellae, Salmonella heidelberg, or control
Escherichia coli. MC12 was CD3+, CD4+, CD8-, and human histocompatibility
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR+. The proliferative response to the shigellae was
blocked by antibody to HLA-DR but not by antibody to HLA-A,B,C. The response
required antigen-presenting cells that shared HLA-DR antigens with the clone and 
appeared to be restricted by HLA-DR2. The epitope recognized by MC12 was
associated with the bacterial membranes. Thus, T-lymphocyte clones that
proliferate in response to some shigellae can be isolated from patients with
shigellosis.
