Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells to date represent the best example of
cells known to have a hybrid function, representing both innate and adaptive
immunity. Shared phenotypic similarities with NK cells together with a rapid
response to a cytokine stimulus and a productive TCR engagement are the features 
that underline the hybrid nature of iNKT cells. Using these criteria, we provide 
molecular and functional evidence demonstrating that CD1d-independent (CD1d(ind))
NKT cells, a population of CD1d-unrestricted NKT cells, are endowed with a hybrid
function far superior to that of iNKT cells: (i) an extensive shared program with
NK cells, (ii) a closer Euclidian distance with NK cells, and (iii) the ability
to respond to innate stimuli (Poly:IC) with cytotoxic potential in the same
manner as NK cells identify a hybrid feature in CD1d(ind)NKT cells that truly
fulfills the dual function of an NK and a T cell. Our finding that CD1d(ind)NKT
cells are programmed to act like NK cells in response to innate signals while
being capable of adaptive responses is unprecedented, and thus might reemphasize 
CD1d-unrestricted NKT cells as a subset of lymphocytes that could affect
biological processes of antimicrobial and tumor immunity in a unique way.
