The cell-surface components of Porphyromonas gingivalis have various biological
activities. In the present study, we investigated the virulence of several
cell-surface components prepared from P. gingivalis in human gingival fibroblasts
(HGF). Furthermore the preventive effect of salivary protein histatin 5 was
investigated. P. gingivalis polysaccharide (PS) significantly inhibited HGF
proliferation, but lipopolysaccharide and outer-membrane protein did not. By
using ELISA analysis, DNA fragmentation in HGFs was observed intracellularly when
treated with the PS. These results suggest that the PS of P. gingivalis can
induce apoptosis in HGF. Pretreatment of PS with histatin 5 restrained the
inhibitory effect of PS on HGF proliferation. Histatin 5 also suppressed the
apoptotic cell death in HGF induced by PS stimulation. The present study suggests
that the PS of P. gingivalis can modulate the cell population in periodontal
tissue, causing periodontitis by inducing HGF cell death through apoptosis. Also 
histatin 5 can inhibit the PS activity and may play an important part in the
regulation of inflammatory periodontal diseases.
