There is a known association between psoriasis and Crohn disease (CD). Patients
with CD are five times more likely to develop psoriasis, and, conversely,
patients with psoriasis are more likely to develop CD. Many gastroenterologists
now accept that CD results from a breakdown of immune tolerance to the microbiota
of the intestine in genetically susceptible individuals. The microbiota of the
skin have recently been investigated in psoriasis. Firmicutes was the most common
phylum, and Streptococcus the most common genus identified. Beta-haemolytic
streptococci have been implicated in both guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis.
Furthermore, the innate immune system has been shown to be activated in
psoriasis, and many of the genes associated with the disease are concerned with
the signalling pathways of the innate immune system, notably interleukin-23 and
nuclear factor κB. Patients with psoriasis also have an increased incidence of
periodontitis, a disease thought to be due to an abnormal response to normal oral
commensals. Based on the similarities between CD and psoriasis, we propose that
psoriasis is due to a breakdown of immune tolerance to the microbiota of the
skin. In support of this hypothesis we provide evidence for microbiota in the
skin, activation of the innate immune system, and genetic abnormalities involving
the innate immune system.
