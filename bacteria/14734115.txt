Recent studies of CD1 structure and intracellular trafficking have demonstrated
significant differences among the CD1 isoforms (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c and CD1d). The
molecular and structural basis for the differential trafficking of CD1 molecules 
has also been delineated. These observations broaden our understanding of why the
immune system has evolved multiple CD1 isoforms to survey different cellular
compartments for lipid antigen presentation, to provide host defense against the 
microbial world and to offer immunoregulation with relevance to tumor immunity
and autoimmunity.
