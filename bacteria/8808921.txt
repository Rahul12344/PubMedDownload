A gene, mpl, encoding
UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelat e ligase was
recognized by its amino acid sequence homology with murC as the open reading
frame yjfG present at 96 min on the Escherichia coli map. The existence of such
an enzymatic activity was predicted from studies indicating that reutilization of
the intact tripeptide L-alanyl-gamma-D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate occurred and
accounted for well over 30% of new cell wall synthesis. Murein tripeptide ligase 
activity could be demonstrated in crude extracts, and greatly increased activity 
was produced when the gene was cloned and expressed under control of the trc
promoter. A null mutant totally lacked activity but was viable, showing that the 
enzyme is not essential for growth.
