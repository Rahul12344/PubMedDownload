BACKGROUND: Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) is an important bacterial etiology of
diarrheal disease, and it causes invasive diseases in immunocompromised hosts.
For bacteremia from some species, blood culture with a rapid time to positivity
(TTP) is associated with greater mortality. This study investigated TTP of NTS
bacteremia and its relationship to clinical parameters and prognosis.
METHODS: Adult patients with NTS bacteremia who were admitted to a tertiary care 
facility in northern Taiwan from January 2010 to December 2012 were enrolled.
Demographics, clinical and microbiological characteristics, and treatment
response were reviewed. The TTP for each patient was retrieved from the automated
machine.
RESULTS: Sixty-six adult patients (mean age, 66.1 years; range, 27-96 years) with
NTS bacteremia were identified by the following serogroup distributions:
serogroup B (23.4%), serogroup C1 (1.6%), serogroup C2 (6.3%), and serogroup D
(68.8%). The in-hospital mortality, 14-day mortality, and 30-day mortality were
15.2%, 7.6%, and 12.1%, respectively. The TTP ranged 6.5-41.7 hours (median: 11.5
hours). Patients with rapid TTP (less than 10 hours), compared to patients
without rapid TTP, were more likely to have liver cirrhosis (31.6% vs. 6.4%,
p = 0.013), endovascular lesions (21.1% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.05), higher bacteremia
score, intensive care unit admission (57.9% vs. 25.5%, p = 0.021), and septic
shock (63.2% vs. 12.8%, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the 
in-hospital mortality and 14-day mortality between patients with TTP <10 hours
and patients with TTP ≥10 hours.
CONCLUSION: The TTP of blood cultures, interpreted with a cut-off point of <10
hours, in patients with NTS bacteremia may provide useful diagnostic and
prognostic information.
