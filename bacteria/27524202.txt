In signaling, Rho-family GTPases bind effector proteins and alter their behavior.
Here we present the crystal structure of Cdc42·GTP bound to the GTPase-activating
protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) of IQGAP2. Four molecules of Cdc42 are bound
to two GRD molecules, which bind each other in a parallel dimer. Two Cdc42s bind 
very similarly to the Ras/RasGAP interaction, while the other two bind primarily 
to "extra domain" sequences from both GRDs, tying the GRDs together. Calorimetry 
confirms two-site binding of Cdc42·GTP for the GRDs of both IQGAP2 and IQGAP1.
Mutation of important extra domain residues reduces binding to single-site and
abrogates Cdc42 binding to a much larger IQGAP1 fragment. Importantly, Rac1·GTP
displays only single-site binding to the GRDs, indicating that only Cdc42
promotes IQGAP dimerization. The structure identifies an unexpected role for
Cdc42 in protein dimerization, thus expanding the repertoire of interactions of
Ras family proteins with their targets.
