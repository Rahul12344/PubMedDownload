BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammation is a whole body reaction having an
infection-positive (i.e., sepsis) or infection-negative origin. It is important
to distinguish between these two etiologies early and accurately because this has
significant therapeutic implications for critically ill patients. We hypothesized
that a molecular classifier based on peripheral blood RNAs could be discovered
that would (1) determine which patients with systemic inflammation had sepsis,
(2) be robust across independent patient cohorts, (3) be insensitive to disease
severity, and (4) provide diagnostic utility. The goal of this study was to
identify and validate such a molecular classifier.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an observational, non-interventional study of 
adult patients recruited from tertiary intensive care units (ICUs). Biomarker
discovery utilized an Australian cohort (n = 105) consisting of 74 cases (sepsis 
patients) and 31 controls (post-surgical patients with infection-negative
systemic inflammation) recruited at five tertiary care settings in Brisbane,
Australia, from June 3, 2008, to December 22, 2011. A four-gene classifier
combining CEACAM4, LAMP1, PLA2G7, and PLAC8 RNA biomarkers was identified. This
classifier, designated SeptiCyte Lab, was validated using reverse transcription
quantitative PCR and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in
five cohorts (n = 345) from the Netherlands. Patients for validation were
selected from the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis study
(ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01905033), which recruited ICU patients from the Academic
Medical Center in Amsterdam and the University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients
recruited from November 30, 2012, to August 5, 2013, were eligible for inclusion 
in the present study. Validation cohort 1 (n = 59) consisted entirely of
unambiguous cases and controls; SeptiCyte Lab gave an area under curve (AUC) of
0.95 (95% CI 0.91-1.00) in this cohort. ROC curve analysis of an independent,
more heterogeneous group of patients (validation cohorts 2-5; 249 patients after 
excluding 37 patients with an infection likelihood of "possible") gave an AUC of 
0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.93). Disease severity, as measured by Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) score or Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) IV score, was not a significant confounding variable. The diagnostic
utility of SeptiCyte Lab was evaluated by comparison to various clinical and
laboratory parameters available to a clinician within 24 h of ICU admission.
SeptiCyte Lab was significantly better at differentiating cases from controls
than all tested parameters, both singly and in various logistic combinations, and
more than halved the diagnostic error rate compared to procalcitonin in all
tested cohorts and cohort combinations. Limitations of this study relate to (1)
cohort compositions that do not perfectly reflect the composition of the intended
use population, (2) potential biases that could be introduced as a result of the 
current lack of a gold standard for diagnosing sepsis, and (3) lack of a
complete, unbiased comparison to C-reactive protein.
CONCLUSIONS: SeptiCyte Lab is a rapid molecular assay that may be clinically
useful in managing ICU patients with systemic inflammation. Further study in
population-based cohorts is needed to validate this assay for clinical use.
