Growth behavior and production of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) of two
probiotics, Pediococcus acidilactici and Lactococcus lactis, each at 107 cfu/g
(P1, L1) and 1010 cfu/g (P2, L2) at different concentrations of
fructooligosaccharide (FOS) [0.5% (F1), 1% (F2), and 2% (F3)] were assessed in
vitro. The time to reach the maximum growth of the probiotics in all 12
treatments was between 8 to 10 h, with the highest and the lowest growth rates
obtained in F1L1P1 (0.34 ± 0.02 OD) and F3L1P1 (0.31 ± 0.05 OD) treatments,
respectively. The shortest and the longest generation times were seen in F1L1P1
(112 ± 1.5 min) and F2L1P1 (231 ± 0.5 min) treatments, respectively. The highest 
and the lowest levels of SCFA production were found in F1L1P1 (17.94 ± 0.74 mg/L)
and F3L1P1 (12.98 ± 0.85 mg/L) treatments, respectively. The three synbiotics
with the highest SCFA production were then fed to Caspian roach (Rutilus frisii
kutum) fry weighing 0.75 ± 0.02 g at 28 °C for 60 days, to assess growth
performance and enzymatic activity. The best growth performance in terms of
weight gain (WG), protein efficiency ratio (PER), net protein utilization (NPU), 
and food conversion ratio (FCR) were seen with F1L1P1. In addition, the highest
activity levels of the digestive enzymes chymotrypsin, lipase, and amylase were
obtained with F1P1L1. The correlation of these in vitro and in vivo data
demonstrated that oral application of these two probiotics each at 107 cfu/g feed
plus 0.5% FOS can improve growth and gut enzyme activity of Caspian roach fry.
