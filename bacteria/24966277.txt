Several proteins in the BRCA-Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway, such as FANCJ, BRCA1,
and FANCD2, interact with mismatch repair (MMR) pathway factors, but the
significance of this link remains unknown. Unlike the BRCA-FA pathway, the MMR
pathway is not essential for cells to survive toxic DNA interstrand crosslinks
(ICLs), although MMR proteins bind ICLs and other DNA structures that form at
stalled replication forks. We hypothesized that MMR proteins corrupt ICL repair
in cells that lack crosstalk between BRCA-FA and MMR pathways. Here, we show that
ICL sensitivity of cells lacking the interaction between FANCJ and the MMR
protein MLH1 is suppressed by depletion of the upstream mismatch recognition
factor MSH2. MSH2 depletion suppresses an aberrant DNA damage response, restores 
cell cycle progression, and promotes ICL resistance through a Rad18-dependent
mechanism. MSH2 depletion also suppresses ICL sensitivity in cells deficient for 
BRCA1 or FANCD2, but not FANCA. Rescue by Msh2 loss was confirmed in Fancd2-null 
primary mouse cells. Thus, we propose that regulation of MSH2-dependent DNA
damage response underlies the importance of interactions between BRCA-FA and MMR 
pathways.
