Graphene oxide has attracted widespread attention in the biomedical fields due to
its excellent biocompatibility. Herein we investigated the layer-number dependent
antibacterial and osteogenic behaviors of graphene oxide in biointerfaces.
Graphene oxide with different layer numbers was deposited on the titanium
surfaces by cathodal electrophoretic deposition with varied deposition voltages. 
The initial cell adhesion and spreading, cell proliferation, and osteogenic
differentiation were observed from all the samples using rat bone mesenchymal
stem cells. Both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus 
aureus were used to investigate the antibacterial effect of the modified titanium
surfaces. Cocultures of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) cells with Escherichia
coli and Staphylococcus aureus were conducted to simulate the conditions of the
clinical practice. The results show that the titanium surfaces with graphene
oxide exhibited excellent antibacterial and osteogenic effects. Increasing the
layer-number of graphene oxide resulted in the augment of reactive oxygen species
levels and the wrinkling, which led to the antibacterial and osteogenic effects, 
respectively. Compared to pure titanium surface in the cells-bacteria coculture
process, the modified titanium surfaces with graphene oxide exhibited higher
surface coverage percentage of cells.
