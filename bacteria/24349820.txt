The detection of acoustic emission (AE) from Lactococcus lactis, ssp lactis is
reported in which emission intensities are used to follow and define metabolic
activity during growth in nutrient broths. Optical density (OD) data were also
acquired during L. lactis growth at 32°C and provided insight into the timing of 
the AE signals relative to the lag, logarithmic, and stationary growth phases of 
the bacteria. The inclusion of a metabolic inhibitor, NaN3, into the nutrient
broth eliminated bacteria metabolic activity according to the OD data, the
absence of which was confirmed using AE data acquisition. The OD and AE data were
also acquired before and after the addition of Bacteriophage c2 in L. lactis
containing nutrient broths during the early or middle logarithmic phase; c2 phage
m.o.i. (Multiplicity of infection) was varied to help differentiate whether the
detected AE was from bacteria cells during lysis or from the c2 phage during
genome injection into the cells. It is proposed that AE measurements using
piezoelectric sensors are sensitive enough to detect bacteria at the amount near 
10(4) cfu/mL, to provide real time data on bacteria metabolic activity and to
dynamically monitor phage infection of cells.
