The C-3-OH, C-4 carbonyl oxygen and hydrogenation of C2=C3 bond on the C-ring of 
2R,3R-dihydromyricetin (DMY) proved to be not necessary for the antibacterial
activity against Staphylococcus aureus. DMY significantly decreased the
intracellular ATP of S. aureus cells but had few effects on pHin, proline
oxidation, succinate dehydrogenase activity or malate dehydrogenase activity.
