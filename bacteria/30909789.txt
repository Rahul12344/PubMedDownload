GBM (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and aggressive brain tumor with 
no curative options available. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel
potent therapeutic drugs for GBM treatment. Here, we show that regorafenib, an
oral multi-kinase inhibitor, exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy over
temozolomide, the first-line chemotherapeutic agent for GBM treatment both in
vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, regorafenib directly stabilizes PSAT1
(phosphoserine aminotransferase 1), a critical enzyme for serine synthesis, to
trigger PRKAA-dependent autophagy initiation and inhibit RAB11A-mediated
autophagosome-lysosome fusion, resulting in lethal autophagy arrest in GBM cells.
Maintenance of PSAT1 at a high level is essential for regorafenib-induced GBM
suppression. Together, our data provide novel mechanistic insights of
regorafenib-induced autophagy arrest and suggest a new paradigm for effective
treatment of GBM.Abbreviations: 3-MA: 3-methyladenine; ACACA: acetyl coenzyme A
