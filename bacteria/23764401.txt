Solid tumors contain a rare population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are
responsible for relapse and metastasis. The existence of CSC however, remains
highly controversial issue. Here we present the evidence for putative CSCs from
mammary tumors amplified by vitamin A/retinol signaling. The cells exhibit
mammary stem cell specific CD29(hi)/CD49f(hi)/CD24(hi) markers, resistance to
radiation and chemo therapeutic agents and form highly metastatic tumors in
NOD/SCID mice. The cells exhibit indefinite self renewal as cell lines.
Furthermore, the cells exhibit impaired retinol metabolism and do not express
enzymes that metabolize retinol into retinoic acid. Vitamin A/retinol also
amplified putative CSCs from breast cancer cell lines that form highly aggressive
tumors in NOD SCID mice. The studies suggest that high purity putative CSCs can
be isolated from solid tumors to establish patient specific cell lines for
personalized therapeutics for pre-clinical translational applications.
Characterization of CSCs will allow understanding of basic cellular and molecular
pathways that are deregulated, mechanisms of tumor metastasis and evasion of
therapies that has direct clinical relevance.
