The causative agent of Legionnaires disease, Legionella pneumophila, injects
several hundred proteins into the cell it infects, many of which interfere with
or exploit vesicular transport processes. One of these proteins, LidA, has been
described as a Rab effector (i.e., a molecule that interacts preferentially with 
the GTP-bound form of Rab). We describe here the structure and biochemistry of a 
complex between the Rab-binding domain of LidA and active Rab8a. LidA displays
structural peculiarities in binding to Rab8a, forming a considerably extended
interface in comparison to known mammalian Rab effectors, and involving regions
of the GTPase that are not seen in other Rab:effector complexes. In keeping with 
this extended binding interface, which involves four Î±-helices and two
pillar-like structures of LidA, the stability of LidA-Rab interactions is
dramatically greater than for other such complexes. For Rab1b and Rab8a, these
affinities are extraordinarily high, but for the more weakly bound Rab6a, K(d)
values of 4 nM for the inactive and 30 pM for the active form were found. Rab1b
and Rab8a appear to bind LidA with K(d) values in the low picomolar range, making
LidA a Rab supereffector.
