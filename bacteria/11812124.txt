Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is an essential enzyme in the
coenzyme A pathway that catalyzes the reversible transfer of an adenylyl group
from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) in the presence of magnesium. To
investigate the reaction mechanism, the high-resolution crystal structures of the
Escherichia coli PPAT have been determined in the presence of either ATP or
Ppant. Structural details of the catalytic center revealed specific roles for
individual amino acid residues involved in substrate binding and catalysis. The
side-chain of His18 stabilizes the expected pentacovalent intermediate, whereas
the side-chains of Thr10 and Lys42 orient the nucleophile for an in-line
displacement mechanism. The binding site for the manganese ion that interacts
with the phosphate groups of the nucleotide has also been identified. Within the 
PPAT hexamer, one trimer is in its substrate-free state, whereas the other is in 
a substrate-bound state.
