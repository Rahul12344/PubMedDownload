T2-weighted cardiovascular magnetic resonance (T2-CMR) of myocardial edema can
quantify the area-at-risk (AAR) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 
has been used to assess myocardial salvage by new cardioprotective therapies.
However, some of these therapies may reduce edema, leading to an underestimation 
of the AAR by T2-CMR. Here, we investigated arterial spin labeling (ASL)
perfusion CMR as a novel approach to quantify the AAR following AMI. Adult
B6sv129-mice were subjected to in vivo left coronary artery ligation for
30 minutes followed by 72 hours reperfusion. T2-mapping was used to quantify the 
edema-based AAR (% of left ventricle) following ischemic preconditioning (IPC) or
cyclosporin-A (CsA) treatment. In control animals, the AAR by T2-mapping
corresponded to that delineated by histology. As expected, both IPC and CsA
reduced MI size. However, IPC, but not CsA, also reduced myocardial edema leading
to an underestimation of the AAR by T2-mapping. In contrast, regions of reduced
myocardial perfusion delineated by cardiac ASL were able to delineate the AAR
when compared to both T2-mapping and histology in control animals, and were not
affected by either IPC or CsA. Therefore, ASL perfusion CMR may be an alternative
method for quantifying the AAR following AMI, which unlike T2-mapping, is not
affected by IPC.
