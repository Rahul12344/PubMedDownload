Mycoplasma genitalium, the causative agent of non-gonococcal urethritis and
pelvic inflammatory disease in humans, is a small eubacterium that lacks a
peptidoglycan cell wall. On the surface of its plasma membrane is the major
surface adhesion complex, known as NAP that is essential for adhesion and gliding
motility of the organism. Here, we have performed cryo-electron tomography of
intact cells and detergent permeabilized M. genitalium cell aggregates, providing
sub-tomogram averages of free and cell-attached NAPs respectively, revealing a
tetrameric complex with two-fold rotational (C2) symmetry. Each NAP has two pairs
of globular lobes (named α and β lobes), arranged as a dimer of heterodimers with
each lobe connected by a stalk to the cell membrane. The β lobes are larger than 
the α lobes by 20%. Classification of NAPs showed that the complex can tilt with 
respect to the cell membrane. A protein complex containing exclusively the
proteins P140 and P110, was purified from M. genitalium and was structurally
characterized by negative-stain single particle EM reconstruction. The close
structural similarity found between intact NAPs and the isolated P140/P110
complexes, shows that dimers of P140/P110 heterodimers are the only components of
the extracellular region of intact NAPs in M. genitalium.
