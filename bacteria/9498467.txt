Venous thrombosis and bacterial infections are common complications of parenteral
nutrition. To test the hypothesis that infection facilitates activation of
coagulation during parenteral nutrition, healthy subjects were intravenously
injected with endotoxin (2 ng/kg) after they had received either 1 week of
standard parenteral nutrition (n = 7) or normal enteral feeding (n = 8). Compared
with enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition was associated with a selectively
enhanced activation of the coagulation system (plasma levels of
thrombin-antithrombin III complexes) during endotoxemia. Activation of the
fibrinolytic system (plasminogen activator activity, tissue-type plasminogen
activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1) proceeded similarly in both
study groups. In patients receiving parenteral nutrition, one common complication
(bacterial infection) may facilitate the occurrence of another common
complication (venous thrombosis) by synergistic stimulation of the coagulation
system.
