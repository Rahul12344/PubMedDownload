Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are an emerging class of regulators of bacterial
gene expression. Most of the regulatory Escherichia coli sRNAs known to date
modulate translation of trans-encoded target mRNAs. We studied the specificity of
sRNA target interactions using gene fusions to green fluorescent protein (GFP) as
a novel reporter of translational control by bacterial sRNAs in vivo. Target
sequences were selected from both monocistronic and polycistronic mRNAs. Upon
expression of the cognate sRNA (DsrA, GcvB, MicA, MicC, MicF, RprA, RyhB, SgrS
and Spot42), we observed highly specific translation repression/activation of
target fusions under various growth conditions. Target regulation was also tested
in mutants that lacked Hfq or RNase III, or which expressed a truncated RNase E
(rne701). We found that translational regulation by these sRNAs was largely
independent of full-length RNase E, e.g. despite the fact that ompA fusion mRNA
decay could no longer be promoted by MicA. This is the first study in which
multiple well-defined E.coli sRNA target pairs have been studied in a uniform
manner in vivo. We expect our GFP fusion approach to be applicable to sRNA
targets of other bacteria, and also demonstrate that Vibrio RyhB sRNA represses a
Vibrio sodB fusion when co-expressed in E.coli.
