Progress towards rapid and simple characterization of biomolecular samples by
scanning probe microscopy is impeded mainly by limitations of the current
approach to sample preparation. We are working on approaches based on chemical
functionalization of mica. Treatment of mica with aminopropyltriethoxy silane
(APTES) makes the surface positively charged (AP-mica) and able to hold DNA in
place for imaging, even in water. We have shown that AP-mica is an appropriate
substrate for numerous nucleoprotein complexes as well. The AFM images of the
complex of DNA with RecA protein are stable and indicate a structural periodicity
for this filament. AP-mica holds strongly such large DNA complexes as kinetoplast
DNA (kDNA) and is an appropriate substrate for their imaging with AFM. We have
further develop this approach for making hydrophobic substrates. Silylation of
mica surface with hexamethyldisilazane (Me-mica) allowed us to get AFM images of 
chlorosomes, an antenna complex isolated from green photosynthetic bacteria.
Me-mica may be converted into a positively charged substrate after treatment with
water solutions of tetraethylammonium bromide or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. 
These activated surfaces show high activity towards binding the DNA molecules.
