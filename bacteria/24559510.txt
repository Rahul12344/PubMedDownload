Oxidative DNA damage is repaired primarily by the base excision repair (BER)
pathway in a process initiated by removal of base lesions or mismatched bases by 
DNA glycosylases. MutY homolog (MYH, MUTYH, or Myh1) is a DNA glycosylase which
excises adenine paired with the oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine
(8-oxoG, or G°), thus reducing G:C to T:A mutations. The resulting
apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is processed by an AP-endonuclease or a
bifunctional glycosylase/lyase. We show here that the major Schizosaccharomyces
pombe AP endonuclease, Apn2, binds to the inter-domain connector located between 
the N- and C-terminal domains of Myh1. This Myh1 inter-domain connector also
interacts with the Hus1 subunit of the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 checkpoint clamp.
Mutagenesis studies indicate that Apn2 and Hus1 bind overlapping but different
sequence motifs on Myh1. Mutation on I(261) of Myh1 reduces its interaction with 
Hus1, but only slightly attenuates its interaction with Apn2. However, E(262) of 
Myh1 is a key determinant for both Apn2 and Hus1 interactions. Like human APE1,
Apn2 has 3'-phosphodiesterase activity. However, unlike hAPE1, Apn2 has a weak AP
endonuclease activity which cleaves the AP sites generated by Myh1 glycosylase.
Functionally, Apn2 stimulates Myh1 glycosylase activity and Apn2
phosphodiesterase activity is stimulated by Myh1. The cross stimulation of Myh1
and Apn2 enzymatic activities is dependent on their physical interaction. Thus,
Myh1 and Apn2 constitute an initial BER complex.
