One out of four people suffers from persistent bad breath. In most of the cases, 
the cause can be found in the mouth, with the presence of tongue coating as the
leading factor, followed by gingivitis and periodontitis, and it is referred to
as oral malodor. Because oral malodor is the result of the degradation of organic
substrates by anaerobic bacteria of the oral cavity, the management is mostly
done by masking the odorous compounds or eliminating the cause (bacteria and
their substrates) either mechanically or chemically. Toothpaste formulations have
been modified to carry antimicrobial and oxidizing agents with an impact on the
process of oral malodor formation. We performed extensive literature search
regarding the effect of dedicated toothpastes in the management of oral malodor. 
The main characteristics of the in vitro and in vivo investigations and their
most relevant findings are presented for discussion. Even though the amount of
publications regarding this topic is far smaller than for others such as caries, 
plaque control and whitening, antibacterial ingredients such as triclosan and
metal ions like stannous and zinc appear to be effective in the control of oral
malodor. On the other hand, data supporting the use of hydrogen peroxide, baking 
soda, essential oils and flavors in the management of oral malodor are rather few
and inconclusive.
