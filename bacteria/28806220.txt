OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of gender with the presentation, outcome,
and host response in critically ill patients with sepsis.
DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study in the ICU of two
tertiary hospitals between January 2011 and January 2014.
PATIENTS: All consecutive critically ill patients admitted with sepsis, involving
1,815 admissions (1,533 patients).
INTERVENTIONS: The host response was evaluated on ICU admission by measuring 19
plasma biomarkers reflecting organ systems implicated in sepsis pathogenesis
(1,205 admissions) and by applying genome-wide blood gene expression profiling
(582 admissions).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sepsis patients admitted to the ICU were more
frequently males (61.0%; p < 0.0001 vs females). Baseline characteristics were
not different between genders. Urosepsis was more common in females; endocarditis
and mediastinitis in men. Disease severity was similar throughout ICU stay.
Mortality was similar up to 1 year after ICU admission, and gender was not
associated with 90-day mortality in multivariate analyses in a variety of
subgroups. Although plasma proteome analyses (including systemic inflammatory and
cytokine responses, and activation of coagulation) were largely similar between
genders, females showed enhanced endothelial cell activation; this difference was
virtually absent in patients more than 55 years old. More than 80% of the
leukocyte blood gene expression response was similar in male and female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The host response and outcome in male and female sepsis patients
requiring ICU admission are largely similar.
