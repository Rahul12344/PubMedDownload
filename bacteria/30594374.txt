The aim of this study was to elucidate the differential gene expression in the
RNA sequencing transcriptome of isolated perfused udders collected from 4
slaughtered Holstein × Zebu crossbred dairy cows experimentally inoculated with
Streptococcus agalactiae. We studied 3 different statistical tools (edgeR,
baySeq, and Cuffdiff 2). In summary, 2 quarters of each udder were experimentally
inoculated with Strep. agalactiae and the other 2 were used as a control. Mammary
tissue biopsies were collected at times 0 and 3 h after infection. The total RNA 
was extracted and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
CA). Transcripts were assembled from the reads aligned to the bovine UMD 3.1
reference genome, and the statistical analyses were performed using the
previously mentioned tools (edgeR, baySeq, and Cuffdiff 2). Finally, the
identified genes were submitted to pathway enrichment analysis. A total of 1,756,
1,161, and 3,389 genes with differential gene expression were identified when
using edgeR, baySeq, and Cuffdiff 2, respectively. A total of 122 genes were
identified by the overlapping of the 3 methods; however, only the platelet
activation presented a significantly enriched pathway. From the results, we
suggest the FCER1G, GNAI2, ORAI1, and VASP genes shared among the 3 methods in
this pathway for posterior biological validation.
