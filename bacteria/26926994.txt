Omenn syndrome (OS) is caused by hypomorphic Rag mutations and characterized by a
profound immunodeficiency associated with autoimmune-like manifestations. Both in
humans and mice, OS is mediated by oligoclonal activated T and B cells. The role 
of microbial signals in disease pathogenesis is debated. Here, we show that
Rag2(R229Q) knock-in mice developed an inflammatory bowel disease affecting both 
the small bowel and colon. Lymphocytes were sufficient for disease induction, as 
intestinal CD4 T cells with a Th1/Th17 phenotype reproduced the pathological
picture when transplanted into immunocompromised hosts. Moreover, oral tolerance 
was impaired in Rag2(R229Q) mice, and transfer of wild-type (WT) regulatory T
cells ameliorated bowel inflammation. Mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency
in the gut resulted in enhanced absorption of microbial products and altered
composition of commensal communities. The Rag2(R229Q) microbiota further
contributed to the immunopathology because its transplant into WT recipients
promoted Th1/Th17 immune response. Consistently, long-term dosing of
broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABXs) in Rag2(R229Q) mice ameliorated intestinal and 
systemic autoimmunity by diminishing the frequency of mucosal and circulating
gut-tropic CCR9(+) Th1 and Th17 T cells. Remarkably, serum hyper-IgE, a hallmark 
of the disease, was also normalized by ABX treatment. These results indicate that
intestinal microbes may play a critical role in the distinctive immune
dysregulation of OS.
