Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes a number of proteins into the extracellular
milieu during growth. Several of these proteins have been associated with
modulation of the host immune response. Antigen 84, or Wag31, is one such protein
that is conserved among all mycobacterial species and is recognized by the sera
from tuberculosis and leprosy patients. Here, we examined the effect of Wag31 on 
the ability of activated human T cells to produce cytokines such as IL-10, IL-17 
and IFN-γ in response to combined anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 stimulation. Purified
recombinant Wag31 inhibited the secretion of IL-10 and IL-17, but not IFN-γ, by
human T cells stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal
antibodies. Furthermore, the C-terminal domain, but not the N-terminal domain,
inhibited the production of IL-10 and IL-17 without a significant effect on the
production of IFN-γ. These data suggest that Wag31 may modulate human T cell
immune responses during tuberculosis infection through its C-terminal domain.
