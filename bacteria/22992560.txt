Peritonitis is an uncommon localization of tuberculosis in Italy; diagnosis and
treatment are often difficult and delayed. Fifteen cases, followed by Infectious 
Diseases Department in Treviso from 2000 to 2010, are described. Mortality and
long term complications were absent, in contrast with medical literature. The
usefulness of steroid therapy is still uncertain. Other sites of infection were
present in 60 percent of patients (pulmonary TB in 47%), urging the clinician to 
examine the case promptly to determine infectiousness status.
