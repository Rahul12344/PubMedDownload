Ubiquitin mediated signaling contributes critically to host cell defenses during 
pathogen infection. Many pathogens manipulate the ubiquitin system to evade these
defenses. Here we characterize a likely effector protein bearing a deubiquitylase
(DUB) domain from the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi,
the causative agent of scrub typhus. The Ulp1-like DUB prefers ubiquitin
substrates over ubiquitin-like proteins and efficiently cleaves polyubiquitin
chains of three or more ubiquitins. The co-crystal structure of the DUB (OtDUB)
domain with ubiquitin revealed three bound ubiquitins: one engages the S1 site,
the second binds an S2 site contributing to chain specificity and the third binds
a unique ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD). The UBD modulates OtDUB activity,
undergoes a pronounced structural transition upon binding ubiquitin, and binds
monoubiquitin with an unprecedented ~5â€‰nM dissociation constant. The
characterization and high-resolution structure determination of this enzyme
should aid in its development as a drug target to counter Orientia infections.
