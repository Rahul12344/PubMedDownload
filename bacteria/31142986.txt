Background: Biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been proposed as
effective antimicrobial agents against endo-perio pathogens. Determination of
cytotoxicity is important for effective clinical use.
Aim: The aim is to determine the cytotoxicity of fungal-derived AgNPs on human
gingival fibroblast (HGF) cell line using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
Materials and Methods: HGF cell cultures were trypsinized and adjusted to 5 × 103
cells/ml and 100-μl cell suspension (50,000 cells/well) and were added to 96-well
plate. After 24 h, 100 μl of AgNPs (8-512-μg/ml concentrations) was added and
incubated at 37°C for 24 h in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Controls were used without
AgNPs. MTT (1 mg/ml) was added and incubated for 4 h at 37°C in 5% CO2
atmosphere. Microscopic examination was done, and absorbance was measured using a
microplate reader at a wavelength of 540 nm. Percentage growth inhibition was
calculated, and the concentration of AgNPs needed to inhibit cell growth by 50%
(CTC50) was generated.
Results: CTC50 was found at a concentration of 260 μg/ml. AgNPs exerted less
cytotoxicity against HGF cell line and increased with increase in the
concentration of AgNPs.
Conclusion: Fungal-derived AgNPs are safe to healthy cells at a concentration
<260 μg/ml. Therefore, they can be effectively used for the treatment of
endo-perio lesions.
