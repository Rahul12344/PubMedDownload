Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a member of the CD28/B7 superfamily that delivers
negative signals upon interaction with its two ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2. The
high-resolution crystal structure of the complex formed by the complete
ectodomains of murine PD-1 and PD-L2 revealed a 1:1 receptor:ligand stoichiometry
and displayed a binding interface and overall molecular organization distinct
from that observed in the CTLA-4/B7 inhibitory complexes. Furthermore, our
structure also provides insights into the association between PD-1 and PD-L1 and 
highlights differences in the interfaces formed by the two PD-1 ligands (PD-Ls)
Mutagenesis studies confirmed the details of the proposed PD-1/PD-L binding
interfaces and allowed for the design of a mutant PD-1 receptor with enhanced
affinity. These studies define spatial and organizational constraints that
control the localization and signaling of PD-1/PD-L complexes within the
immunological synapse and provide a basis for manipulating the PD-1 pathways for 
immunotherapy.
