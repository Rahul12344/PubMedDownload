The murine transcription factor ALF1 belongs to the class of basic
helix-loop-helix proteins specific for the NCAGNTGN-version of the E-box. Binding
of homodimeric ALF1 to variants of this motif was studied by a combination of
binding site selection technology and DNA modification interference analysis. The
results showed that substitutions at the non-conserved positions in the E-box
sequence could cause profound alterations in the patterns of specific contacts at
the protein-DNA interface. Thus, both the overall extent of the binding region
and the backbone phosphate contact pattern differed markedly between closely
related E-boxes with similar affinities for ALF1. The identity of the base at the
inner N was an important determinant of contact pattern specification. The E-box 
variants differed in their ability to mediate ALF1 dependent transcriptional
activation in vivo. We discuss the possibility that adaptability in basic
helix-loop-helix protein-DNA interactions can result in complexes with different 
functional properties.
