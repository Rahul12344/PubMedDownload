PROBLEM: Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and
mortality. We tested the hypothesis that the choriodecidua plays a role in
GBS-stimulated human beta defensin(HBD)-2 increases in amnion cells through a
secreted factor of choriodecidual origin.
METHOD OF STUDY: Human amnion epithelial cells were treated with choriodecidual
GBS-conditioned medium, live GBS, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), or lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS), with and without IL-1 inhibitors.
RESULTS: Choriodecidual tissue punches released IL-1α and IL-1β in response to
GBS and this medium significantly stimulated release of HBD-2 by amnion cell
cultures. Inhibitors of IL-1 significantly impaired the release of HBD-2 from
amnion cells treated with GBS choriodecidual conditioned medium. Direct
stimulation of amnion cells with GBS, LTA, or LPS did not increase HBD-2 release.
CONCLUSION: Paracrine signaling involving IL-1 of choriodecidual origin is likely
a critical driver for amnion HBD-2 increases in response to GBS infection of
extraplacental membranes.
