Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important cause of Gram-negative pneumonia and
sepsis. Mice deficient for TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β
(TRIF) demonstrate enhanced bacterial growth and dissemination during Klebsiella 
pneumonia. We show here that the impaired antibacterial defense of TRIF mutant
mice is associated with absent interferon (IFN)-x03B3; production in the lungs.
IFN-x03B3; production by splenocytes in response to K. pneumoniae in vitro was
critically dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), the common TLR adaptor
myeloid differentiation primary response gene (MyD88) and TRIF. Reconstitution of
TRIF mutant mice with recombinant IFN-x03B3; via the airways reduced bacterial
loads in lungs and distant body sites to levels measured in wild-type mice, and
partially restored pulmonary cytokine levels. The IFN-x03B3;-induced, improved,
enhanced antibacterial response in TRIF mutant mice occurred at the expense of
increased hepatocellular injury. These data indicate that TRIF mediates
antibacterial defense during Gram-negative pneumonia, at least in part, by
inducing IFN-x03B3; at the primary site of infection.
