Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 4, DPP5, DPP7 and DPP11, expressed in the periplasmic 
space, are crucial for energy production for Porphyromonas gingivalis, an
asaccharolytic bacterium that causes periodontal disease. Bacterial DPP4 seems to
be involved in regulation of blood glucose level via degradation of incretins.
The present study aimed to identify four dpp orthologs in oral microbiota by
database searches, and their enzymatic activities in periodontopathic and
cariogenic bacteria, as well as oral specimens were determined. Search in the
databases suggested that 43 species of 772 taxa possess dpp4 and other dpp genes.
Most species are in the genera Bacteroides, Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas,
Prevotella and Tannerella, indicating a limited distribution of dpp orthologs in 
anaerobic periodontopathic rods. In accordance with those results, activities of 
all four DPPs were demonstrated in P. gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis and 
Tannerella forsythia, while they were negligible in Treponema denticola,
Fusobacterium nucleatum and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. Furthermore,
DPP activities were also detected in subgingival dental plaque at different
intensities among individual specimens, while DPP4 activity presumably derived
from human entity was solely predominant in saliva samples. These findings
demonstrated that DPP activities in dental plaque serve as potent biomarkers to
indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
