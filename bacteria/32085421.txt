Modifications found in the Anticodon Stem Loop (ASL) of tRNAs play important
roles in regulating translational speed and accuracy. Threonylcarbamoyl adenosine
(t6A37) and 5-methoxycarbonyl methyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U34) are critical ASL
modifications that have been linked to several human diseases. The model yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae is viable despite the absence of both modifications,
growth is however greatly impaired. The major observed consequence is a
subsequent increase in protein aggregates and aberrant morphology. Proteomic
analysis of the t6A-deficient strain (sua5 mutant) revealed a global
mistranslation leading to protein aggregation without regard to physicochemical
properties or t6A-dependent or biased codon usage in parent genes. However, loss 
of sua5 led to increased expression of soluble proteins for mitochondrial
function, protein quality processing/trafficking, oxidative stress response, and 
energy homeostasis. These results point to a global function for t6A in protein
homeostasis very similar to mcm5/s2U modifications.
