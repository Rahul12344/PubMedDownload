Killer-cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) genes are inherited as haplotypes. They are
expressed by NK cells and linked to outcomes of infectious diseases and pregnancy
in humans. Understanding how genotype relates to phenotype is difficult because
of the extensive diversity of the KIR family. Indeed, high-resolution KIR
genotyping and phenotyping in single NK cells in the context of disease
association is lacking. In this article, we describe a new method to separate NK 
cells expressing allotypes of the KIR2DL1 gene carried by the KIR A haplotype
(KIR2DL1A) from those expressing KIR2DL1 alleles carried by the KIR B haplotype
(KIR2DL1B). We find that in KIR AB heterozygous individuals, different KIR2DL1
allotypes can be detected in both peripheral blood and uterine NK cells. Using
this new method, we demonstrate that both blood and uterine NK cells codominantly
express KIR2DL1A and KIR2DL1B allotypes but with a predominance of KIR2DL1A
variants, which associate with enhanced NK cell function. In a case-control study
of pre-eclampsia, we show that KIR2DL1A, not KIR2DL1B, associates with increased 
disease risk. This method will facilitate our understanding of how individual
KIR2DL1 allelic variants affect NK cell function and contribute to disease risk.
