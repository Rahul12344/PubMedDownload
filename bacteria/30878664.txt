BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gastric dendritic cells (DCs) control the adaptive response to
infection with Helicobacter pylori, a major risk factor for peptic ulcer disease 
and gastric cancer. We hypothesize that DC interactions with the gastric
epithelium position gastric DCs for uptake of luminal H pylori and promote DC
responses to epithelial-derived mediators. The aim of this study was to determine
whether the gastric epithelium actively recruits DCs using a novel co-culture
model of human gastric epithelial spheroids and monocyte-derived DCs.
METHODS: Spheroid cultures of primary gastric epithelial cells were infected with
H pylori by microinjection. Co-cultures were established by adding human
monocyte-derived DCs to the spheroid cultures and were analyzed for DC
recruitment and antigen uptake by confocal microscopy. Protein array, gene
expression polymerase chain reaction array, and chemotaxis assays were used to
identify epithelial-derived chemotactic factors that attract DCs. Data from the
co-culture model were confirmed using human gastric tissue samples.
RESULTS: Human monocyte-derived DCs co-cultured with gastric spheroids
spontaneously migrated to the gastric epithelium, established tight interactions 
with the epithelial cells, and phagocytosed luminally applied H pylori. DC
recruitment was increased upon H pylori infection of the spheroids and involved
the activity of multiple chemokines including CXCL1, CXCL16, CXCL17, and CCL20.
Enhanced chemokine expression and DC recruitment to the gastric epithelium also
was observed in H pylori-infected human gastric tissue samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the gastric epithelium actively recruits
DCs for immunosurveillance and pathogen sampling through chemokine-dependent
mechanisms, with increased recruitment upon active H pylori infection.
