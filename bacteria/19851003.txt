Bacterial phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyzes the penultimate
step in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the reversible
transfer of an adenylyl group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) to form
dephospho-CoA (dPCoA) and pyrophosphate. Previous structural studies have
revealed how several ligands are recognized by bacterial PPATs. ATP, ADP, Ppant
and dPCoA bind to the same binding site in a highly similar manner, while CoA
binds to a partially overlapping site in a different mode. To provide further
structural insights into ligand binding, the crystal structure of Staphylococcus 
aureus PPAT was solved in a binary complex with 3'-phosphoadenosine
5'-phosphosulfate (PAPS). This study unexpectedly revealed a new mode of ligand
binding to PPAT, thus providing potentially useful information for
structure-based discovery of inhibitors of bacterial PPATs.
