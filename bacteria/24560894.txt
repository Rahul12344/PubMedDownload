Cystic fibrosis is a lethal genetic disorder characterized by viscous mucus and
bacterial colonization of the airways. Airway surface liquid represents a first
line of pulmonary defense. Studies in humans and animal models of cystic fibrosis
indicate that the pH of airway surface liquid is reduced in the absence of cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator function. Many aspects of the innate
host defense system of the airways are pH sensitive, including antimicrobial
peptide/protein activity, the rheological properties of secreted mucins,
mucociliary clearance, and the activity of proteases. This review will focus on
how changes in airway surface liquid pH may contribute to the host defense defect
in cystic fibrosis soon after birth. Understanding how changes in pH impact
mucosal immunity may lead to new therapies that can modify the airway surface
liquid environment, improve airway defenses, and alter the disease course.
