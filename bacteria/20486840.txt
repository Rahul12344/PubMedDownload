BACKGROUND: A unique form of postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) with
IgA-dominant deposition mimicking IgA nephropathy has been increasingly reported.
METHODS: We compared the clinical and histological features of 12 patients with
postinfectious IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis to 134 patients with idiopathic
IgA nephropathy.
RESULTS: In addition to hypocomplementemia and subepithelial hump-shaped deposits
characteristic of PIGN, patients with postinfectious IgA-dominant
glomerulonephritis had older age (62.3 +/- 16.9 vs. 37.9 +/- 16.3 years; p <
0.001) and more frequently presented with acute renal failure (83.3% vs. 10.4%; p
< 0.001) than patients with idiopathic IgA nephropathy. Moreover, glomerular
changes including endocapillary proliferation, neutrophil infiltration, and
capillary loops deposits by immunofluorescence were more commonly present in
postinfectious IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: PIGN could be characterized by glomerular IgA-dominant deposition
resembling idiopathic IgA nephropathy. It is essential to differentiate
postinfectious IgA-dominant glomerulonephritis from idiopathic IgA nephropathy
because of the different treatments and prognosis of the two diseases.
