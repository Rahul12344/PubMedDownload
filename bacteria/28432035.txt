Cerebral pericytes are mural cells embedded in the basement membrane of
capillaries. Increasing evidence suggests that they play important role in
controlling neurovascular functions, i.e. cerebral blood flow, angiogenesis and
permeability of the blood-brain barrier. These cells can also influence
neuroinflammation which is highly regulated by the innate immune system.
Therefore, we systematically tested the pattern recognition receptor expression
of brain pericytes. We detected expression of NOD1, NOD2, NLRC5, NLRP1-3, NLRP5, 
NLRP9, NLRP10 and NLRX mRNA in non-treated cells. Among the ten known human TLRs,
TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6 and TLR10 were found to be expressed. Inflammatory
mediators induced the expression of NLRA, NLRC4 and TLR9 and increased the levels
of NOD2, TLR2, inflammasome-forming caspases and inflammasome-cleaved
interleukins. Oxidative stress, on the other hand, upregulated expression of
TLR10 and NLRP9. Activation of selected pattern recognition receptors can lead to
inflammasome assembly and caspase-dependent secretion of IL-1β. TNF-α and IFN-γ
increased the levels of pro-IL-1β and pro-caspase-1 proteins; however, no
canonical activation of NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3 or NLRC4 inflammasomes could be
observed in human brain vascular pericytes. On the other hand, we could
demonstrate secretion of active IL-1β in response to non-canonical inflammasome
activation, i.e. intracellular LPS or infection with E. coli bacteria. Our in
vitro results indicate that pericytes might have an important regulatory role in 
neuroinflammation.
