We have developed a method for isolation of random peptides that inhibit
intracellular processes in bacteria. A library of random peptides expressed as
fusions to Escherichia coli thioredoxin (aptamers) were expressed under the tight
control of the arabinose-inducible P(BAD) promoter. A selection was applied to
the library to isolate aptamers that interfered with the activity of thymidylate 
synthase (ThyA) in vivo. Expression of an aptamer isolated by this method
resulted in a ThyA(-) phenotype that was suppressed by simultaneous
overexpression of ThyA. Two-hybrid analysis showed that this aptamer is likely to
interact with ThyA in vivo. The library also was screened for aptamers that
inhibited growth of bacteria expressing them, and five such aptamers were
characterized. Four aptamers were bacteriostatic when expressed, whereas one
showed a bactericidal effect. Introduction of translational stop codons into
various aptamers blocked their activity, suggesting that their biological effects
were likely to be due to protein aptamer rather than RNA. Combinatorial aptamers 
provide a new genetic and biochemical tool for identifying targets for
antibacterial drug development.
