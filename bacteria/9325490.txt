PROBLEM: TJ6 will be one of the molecules involved in fetal-specific immune
suppression during pregnancy. In the mouse and human decidua, the regulation of
uterine natural killer (uNK) cells is important during pregnancy.
METHOD OF STUDY: To further understand the possible functions of TJ6 during
pregnancy, syngeneic, allogeneic, and mutant mice were examined for TJ6
expression.
RESULTS: Immunoblotting showed that TJ6 protein was expressed on most of the
placenta-associated mononuclear cells, and the size was 70-72 kDa at all stages
of pregnancy. The expression of TJ6 mRNA was studied by a ribonuclease protection
assay in syngeneic and allogeneic matings, and in immune-deficient mice of
genotypes scid/scid and scid/scid.bg/bg.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic disparity, lack of T and B lymphocytes, and loss of NK lytic
function had no significant effect on the expression of TJ6 mRNA.
