The covalent attachment of SUMO to lysine residues of cellular proteins serves as
an important mechanism for the dynamic control of protein networks. SUMO
conjugates typically mediate selected protein-protein interactions by binding to 
specific recognition modules. Identification of SUMO-binding proteins and the
characterization of the binding motifs are key to understanding SUMO signaling.
Here we describe two complementary approaches that are used to tackle these
questions.
