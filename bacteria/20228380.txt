Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein is a nucleoprotein that can regulate a
variety of cellular stress responses. The aim of this study was to determine
qualitative and quantitative changes in PML expression in preeclamptic placentae.
Immunoblot, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to determine PML gene
expression and localization in normal (n = 6) and preeclamptic (n = 6) placentae 
and primary cells. Promyelocytic leukemia protein was immunolocalized within
nuclei of villus mesenchyme, but largely absent in trophoblast nuclei, with a
trend for increased PML reactivity in preeclamptic placenta. Immunoblot analyses 
of nuclear extracts confirmed relative increases (approximately 3-fold) of PML
expression in preeclamptic placentae (P < .05). Conversely, less PML messenger
RNA (mRNA; approximately 2-fold) was detected in preeclamptic versus normal
placental samples. In vitro, PML expression could be increased by hypoxia in
cultured endothelial cells but not trophoblast. Increased PML protein expression 
in preeclamptic villi suggests it could contribute to decreased vascularity and
placental growth and/or function.
