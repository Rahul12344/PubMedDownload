Palmaria palmata (dulse) is an edible red alga constituting a potential protein
source in human diet. However, previous studies showed that the digestibility of 
dulse proteins is bad because of the cell-wall encapsulating cytoplasmic proteins
and the presence of fibers. The water-soluble xylan, present in high proportions 
in dulse, could be involved to explain the weak digestibility of proteins. To
limit the influence of fibers and to improve the nutritional quality of these
proteins, we have treated dulse by physical processes or by fermentation by
moulds. After a 30 min predigestion by pepsin followed by a 6 h digestion into a 
cell dialysis containing porcine pancreatin, the corrected in vitro digestibility
of crude dulse was very low (about 1.5% after correction by digestibility blank).
The in vitro protein digestibility was estimated to 58% of that of casein for
dulse samples obtained after washing in demineralized water and grinding in
liquid nitrogen. The in vitro protein digestibility of fermented samples was
45%-65% of that of casein. After physical treatment, the digestibility
improvement was related to the elimination of soluble molecules such as xylan and
mineral salts. The improvement observed after fermentations seemed due to the
degradation of insoluble fibers.
