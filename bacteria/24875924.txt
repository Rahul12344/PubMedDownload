Chemical investigations of a soil-derived Streptomyces sp. led to the isolation
of five new polyketides, (+)-oxanthromicin, (±)-hemi-oxanthromicins A/B,
(±)-spiro-oxanthromicin A and oxanthroquinone, and the known alkaloid
staurosporine, and the detection of four new metastable analogues,
(±)-spiro-oxanthromicins B1/B2/C1/C2. Among the compounds tested, SAR
investigations established that the synthetic oxanthroquinone ethyl ester and
3-O-methyl-oxanthroquinone ethyl ester were optimal at mislocalising oncogenic
mutant K-Ras from the plasma membrane of intact Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 
cells (IC50 4.6 and 1.2 μM), while a sub-EC50 dose of (±)-spiro-oxanthromicin A
was optimal at potentiating (750%) the K-Ras inhibitory activity of staurosporine
(IC50 60 pM). These studies demonstrate that a rare class of Streptomyces
polyketide modulates K-Ras plasma membrane localisation, with implications for
the future treatment of K-Ras dependent cancers.
