The processes of T-cell development and activation employ similar immature and
mature receptors as well as similar signal transduction pathways to achieve
different outcomes. Many signaling molecules are shared between the receptor
signaling pathways, including two families of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine
kinases, the Src family and the Syk family. The two Syk family members expressed 
in T cells, Syk and ZAP-70, are structurally similar but are expressed at
different times during thymic development and during T-cell activation. These two
kinases, although they share many physical features, differ in terms of
biochemical activity and regulation. We discuss the overlapping and distinct
characteristics of Syk and ZAP-70 in T-cell signaling and the potential
biological importance of their differences.
