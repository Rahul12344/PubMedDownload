Homology models of CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450RAI2) and CYP26B1 spliced variant were
derived using the crystal structure of cyanobacterial CYP120A1 as template for
the model building. The quality of the homology models generated were carefully
evaluated, and the natural substrate all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), several
tetralone-derived retinoic acid metabolizing blocking agents (RAMBAs), and a
well-known potent inhibitor of CYP26B1 (R115866) were docked into the homology
model of full-length cytochrome P450 26B1. The results show that in the model of 
the full-length CYP26B1, the protein is capable of distinguishing between the
natural substrate (atRA), R115866, and the tetralone derivatives. The spliced
variant of CYP26B1 model displays a reduced affinity for atRA compared to the
full-length enzyme, in accordance with recently described experimental
information.
