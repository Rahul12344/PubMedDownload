In Escherichia coli the mutY (or micA)-dependent DNA mismatch repair pathway can 
convert A degrees G and A degrees C mismatches to C.G and G.C base pairs,
respectively, through a short repair-tract mechanism. The MutY protein has been
purified to near homogeneity from an E. coli overproducer strain. Purified MutY
has been shown to contain both N-glycosylase and 3' apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)
endonuclease activities. The N-glycosylase removes the mispaired adenines of A
degrees G and A degrees C mismatches, and the AP endonuclease acts on the first
phosphodiester bond 3' to the AP sites. The N-glycosylase and the nicking
(combined N-glycosylase and AP endonuclease) activities copurified through
multiple chromatographic steps without a change in relative specific activities. 
Furthermore, both N-glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities can be recovered
by renaturation of a single polypeptide band from an SDS/polyacrylamide gel.
Renaturation required the presence of iron and sulfide. These findings suggest
that the MutY protein, like endonuclease III, is an iron-sulfur protein. DNA
fragments with A degrees C mismatches were 20-fold less active than DNA with A
degrees G mispairs as a substrate for purified MutY.
