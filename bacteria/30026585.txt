SP7/Osterix (OSX) is a master regulatory transcription factor that activates a
variety of genes during differentiation of osteoblasts. However, the influence of
post-translational modifications on the regulation of its transactivation
activity is largely unknown. Here, we report that sirtuins, which are
NAD(+)-dependent deacylases, regulate lysine deacylation-mediated transactivation
of OSX. Germline Sirt7 knockout mice develop severe osteopenia characterized by
decreased bone formation and an increase of osteoclasts. Similarly,
osteoblast-specific Sirt7 knockout mice showed attenuated bone formation.
Interaction of SIRT7 with OSX leads to the activation of transactivation by OSX
without altering its protein expression. Deacylation of lysine (K) 368 in the
C-terminal region of OSX by SIRT7 promote its N-terminal transactivation
activity. In addition, SIRT7-mediated deacylation of K368 also facilitates
depropionylation of OSX by SIRT1, thereby increasing OSX transactivation
activity. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SIRT7 has a critical role in
bone formation by regulating acylation of OSX.
