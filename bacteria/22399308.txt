Severe infection and inflammation almost invariably lead to hemostatic
abnormalities, ranging from insignificant laboratory changes to gross activation 
of coagulation that may result in localized thrombotic complications or systemic 
intravascular fibrin deposition. Systemic inflammation results in activation of
coagulation, due to tissue factor-mediated thrombin generation, downregulation of
physiological anticoagulant mechanisms, and inhibition of fibrinolysis.
Proinflammatory cytokines, immune cells, and the endothelium play a central role 
in the differential effects on the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways.
Vice-versa, activation of the coagulation system may importantly affect
inflammatory responses by direct and indirect mechanisms. Similar mechanisms
appear to play a role in the development of atherosclerosis and related arterial 
thrombosis. Apart from the general coagulation response to inflammation
associated with severe infection, specific infections may cause distinct
features, such as hemorrhagic fever or thrombotic microangiopathy.
