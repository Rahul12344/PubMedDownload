Nitric oxide (NO) defends against intracellular pathogens, but its synthesis must
be regulated due to cell and tissue toxicity. During infection, macrophages
import extracellular arginine to synthesize NO, generating the byproduct
citrulline. Accumulated intracellular citrulline is thought to fuel arginine
synthesis catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthase (Ass1) and argininosuccinate
lyase (Asl), which would lead to abundant NO production. Instead, we find that
citrulline is exported from macrophages during early stages of NO production with
<2% retained for recycling via the Ass1-Asl pathway. Later, extracellular
arginine is depleted, and Ass1 expression allows macrophages to synthesize
arginine from imported citrulline to sustain NO output. Ass1-deficient
macrophages fail to salvage citrulline in arginine-scarce conditions, leading to 
their inability to control mycobacteria infection. Thus, extracellular arginine
fuels rapid NO production in activated macrophages, and citrulline recycling via 
Ass1 and Asl is a fail-safe system that sustains optimum NO production.
