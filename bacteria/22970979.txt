Total syntheses of HMP-Y1, atrop-HMP-Y1, hibarimicinone, atrop-hibarimicinone,
and HMP-P1 are described using a two-directional synthesis strategy. A novel
benzyl fluoride Michael-Claisen reaction sequence was developed to construct the 
complete carbon skeleton of HMP-Y1 and atrop-HMP-Y1 via a symmetrical,
two-directional, double annulation. Through efforts to convert HMP-Y1 derivatives
to hibarimicinone and HMP-P1, a biomimetic mono-oxidation to desymmetrize
protected HMP-Y1 was realized. A two-directional unsymmetrical double annulation 
and biomimetic etherification was developed to construct the polycyclic and
highly oxidized skeleton of hibarimicinone, atrop-hibarimicinone, and HMP-P1. The
use of a racemic biaryl precursor allowed for the synthesis of both
hibarimicinone atropisomers and provides the first confirmation of the structure 
of atrop-hibarimicinone. Additionally, this work documents the first reported
full characterization of atrop-hibarimicinone, HMP-Y1, atrop-HMP-Y1, and HMP-P1. 
Last, a pH-dependent rotational barrier about the C2-C2' bond of hibarimicinone
was discovered, which provides valuable information necessary to achieve
syntheses of the glycosylated congeners of hibarimicinone.
