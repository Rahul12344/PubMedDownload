Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human
pathogen against which an effective vaccine does not yet exist. The S. pyogenes
protein SpyCEP (S. pyogenes cell-envelope proteinase) is a surface-exposed
subtilisin-like serine protease of 1647 amino acids. In addition to its
auto-protease activity, SpyCEP is capable of cleaving interleukin 8 and related
chemokines, contributing to GAS immune-evasion strategies. SpyCEP is immunogenic 
and confers protection in animal models of GAS infections. In order to
structurally characterize this promising vaccine candidate, several SpyCEP
protein-expression constructs were designed, cloned, produced in Escherichia
coli, purified by affinity chromatography and subjected to crystallization
trials. Crystals of a selenomethionyl form of a near-full-length SpyCEP
ectodomain were obtained. The crystals diffracted X-rays to 3.3 Å resolution and 
belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=139.2, b=120.4,
c=104.3 Å, β=111°.
