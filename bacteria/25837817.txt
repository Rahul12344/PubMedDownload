Bacterial Wzx flippases translocate (flip) short oligosaccharide repeat units (O 
units) across the inner membrane into the periplasm, which is a critical step in 
the assembly of many O antigens, capsules and other surface polysaccharides.
There is enormous diversity in O antigens and capsules in particular, even within
species. Wzx proteins are similarly diverse, but it has been widely accepted that
they have significant specificity only for the first sugar of an O unit. In this 
study, we analysed the Wzx from the Salmonella enterica group C2 O antigen gene
cluster, which is a unique and divergent member of a set of gene clusters that
produce galactose-initiated O antigens. We demonstrate that this Wzx has a strong
preference for the presence of an abequose side-branch, which manifests in a
reduction of long-chain O antigen and a major growth defect. This contributes to 
a growing body of evidence that, contrary to earlier proposals, Wzx flippases
commonly exhibit a strong preference for the structure of their native O unit.
