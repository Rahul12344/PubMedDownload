During evaluation for macrocytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, a 74-year-old
female was found to have a leukocytosis with two apparent populations of
malignant cells identified in her peripheral blood smear and bone marrow
aspirate. Morphologic characteristics of the two cell types were unusual, and
cytochemical assays yielded ambiguous results. Two-color flow cytometric analysis
demonstrated two distinct cell populations with immunophenotyping patterns
consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CD5+/CD20+) and acute myelocytic
leukemia (CD33+/CD34+), detected concurrently. The concomitant appearance of CLL 
and AML has been reported only rarely. The use of two-color flow cytometry to
differentiate the populations demonstrates the utility of this technology in
resolving unusual hematological malignancies.
