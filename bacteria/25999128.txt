Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase I (CATI) detoxifies the antibiotic
chloramphenicol and confers a corresponding resistance to bacteria. In this study
we identified this enzyme as a steroid acetyltransferase and designed a new and
efficient Escherichia-coli-based biocatalyst for the regioselective acetylation
of C21 hydroxy groups in steroids of pharmaceutical interest. The cells carried a
recombinant catI gene controlled by a constitutive promoter. The capacity of the 
whole-cell system to modify different hydroxysteroids was investigated, and NMR
spectroscopy revealed that all substrates were selectively transformed into the
corresponding 21-acetoxy derivatives. The biotransformation was optimized, and
the reaction mechanism is discussed on the basis of a computationally modeled
substrate docking into the crystal structure of CATI.
