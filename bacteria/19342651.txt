Statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents that also decrease
inflammation and target enzymes essential for prenylation, an important process
in the activation and intracellular transport of proteins vital for a wide
variety of cellular functions. Here, we report that statins impair a critical
component of the innate immune response, CD1d-mediated Ag presentation. The
addition of specific intermediates in the isoprenylation pathway reversed this
effect, whereas specific targeting of enzymes responsible for prenylation
mimicked the inhibitory effects of statins on Ag presentation by CD1d as well as 
MHC class II molecules. This study demonstrates the importance of isoprenylation 
in the regulation of Ag presentation and suggests a mechanism by which statins
reduce inflammatory responses.
