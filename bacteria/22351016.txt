This chapter describes an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation
protocol for torenia, a plant that has several useful characteristics and is
primarily used for ornamental and experimental purposes. Leaf segments of torenia
were co-cultured with A. tumefaciens containing a vector plasmid for 7 days at
22°C under dark conditions on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1 mg/L
benzyladenine, 1 mg/L indoleacetic acid, and 100 μM acetosyringone. Subsequent
culturing at 25°C under a 16-h photoperiod with fluorescent light on MS medium
containing 1 mg/L benzyladenine, 300 mg/L carbenicillin, and selection agent (300
mg/L kanamycin or 20 mg/L hygromycin) allowed for transformant selection.
Transgenic shoots were obtained from green compact calli after 2-3 months of
culture in the selection medium. This method can achieve a transformation rate of
approximately 5% (transformants/explant).
