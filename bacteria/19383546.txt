The apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf-1) is a protein that binds to
cytochrome c, and in the presence of dATP/ATP oligomerizes to assume the role of 
an adaptor platform for activating the caspase-9 zymogen. In order to study the
biochemical and structural details of Apaf-1 function, we have generated an
expression construct from pcDNA 3-Apaf-1XL for production of the WD40 domain
((WD40)Apaf-1) in Escherichia coli. The WD40 domain expressed contains 825 amino 
acids in addition to an N-terminal His(6) tag derived from the cloning vector.
The expressed protein is invariably localized in the inclusion body fraction of
E. coli. A simple protocol involving Sephadex G100 chromatography developed for
purifying the protein starting from inclusion bodies has allowed protein recovery
in highly pure form. Basic fluorescence and CD spectra indicate that the refolded
protein has extensive secondary and tertiary structures. Immunoprecipitation
studies have provided qualitative information about the binding interaction of
(WD40)Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. The binding interaction has been quantified by
spectrophotometric titration of cytochrome c with recombinant (WD40)Apaf-1. The
results demonstrate a weak binding for cytochrome c and (WD40)Apaf-1 interaction,
the binding affinity being 390 nM. The analysis indicates a 2:1 or possibly even 
3:1 stoichiometry for cytochrome c and (WD40)Apaf-1 binding interaction.
