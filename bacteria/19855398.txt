We report that infection of draining lymph nodes (DLNs) by Salmonella typhimurium
results in the specific downregulation of the homeostatic chemokines CCL21 and
CXCL13, which are essential for normal DLN organization and function. Our data
reveal that the mechanism of this suppression is dependent on S. typhimurium LPS 
(sLPS). The decrease in CCL21 expression involves interaction between sLPS and
CCL21-producing cells within DLNs, triggering a distinct Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)-mediated host signaling response. In this response, suppressor of cytokine
signaling-3 (Socs3) is upregulated, which negatively regulates mothers against
decapentaplegic homolog-3 (Smad3)-initiated production of CCL21. Disruption of
lymph node architecture and cellular trafficking enhances S. typhimurium
virulence and could represent a mechanism of immune suppression used by pathogens
that primarily target lymphoid tissue.
