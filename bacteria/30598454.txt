T cells proliferate vigorously following acute depletion of CD4+ Foxp3+ T
regulatory cells [natural Tregs (nTregs)] and also when naive T cells are
transferred to syngeneic, nTreg-deficient Rag1 -/- hosts. Here, using mice raised
in an antigen-free (AF) environment, we show that proliferation in these two
situations is directed to self ligands rather than food or commensal antigens. In
both situations, the absence of nTregs elevates B7 expression on host dendritic
cells (DCs) and enables a small subset of naive CD4 T cells with high self
affinity to respond overtly to host DCs: bidirectional T/DC interaction ensues,
leading to progressive DC activation and reciprocal strong proliferation of T
cells accompanied by peripheral Treg (pTreg) formation. Likewise, high-affinity
CD4 T cells proliferate vigorously and form pTregs when cultured with autologous 
DCs in vitro in the absence of nTregs: this anti-self response is MHCII/peptide
dependent and elicited by the raised level of B7 on cultured DCs. The data
support a model in which self tolerance is imposed via modulation of CD28
signaling and explains the pathological effects of superagonistic CD28
antibodies.
