Relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) induced with the
immunodominant epitope from proteolipid protein, PLP139-151, is characterized by 
the development of recurrent relapses with recruitment of T cells reactive to
additional myelin peptides, including PLP178-191 (epitope spreading). In this
study, we have determined that the CD28/B7 costimulatory pathway is involved in
this process. We found preferential up-regulation of B7-1 during the course of
R-EAE and a selective increase in its functional costimulatory activity, relative
to B7-2. Anti B7-1 F(ab) fragment therapy, but not anti B7-2 MAb therapy, blocked
clinical relapses, ameliorated CNS pathology, and blocked epitope spreading.
These results suggest that the maintenance of autoimmune reactivity in EAE
depends on CD28/B7-1-dependent costimulation of newly recruited T cells
responsible for epitope spreading. These studies have important implications for 
the role of epitope spreading in disease progression and the clinical application
of costimulatory antagonists in autoimmune diseases.
