Combined immunotherapy targeting the immune checkpoint receptors cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), or
CTLA-4 and the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) exhibits superior anti-tumor responses
compared with single-agent therapy. Here, we examined the molecular basis for
this synergy. Using reconstitution assays with fluorescence readouts, we found
that PD-L1 and the CTLA-4 ligand CD80 heterodimerize in cis but not trans.
Quantitative biochemistry and cell biology assays revealed that PD-L1:CD80
cis-heterodimerization inhibited both PD-L1:PD-1 and CD80:CTLA-4 interactions
through distinct mechanisms but preserved the ability of CD80 to activate the
T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression on
antigen-presenting cells (APCs) prevented CTLA-4-mediated trans-endocytosis of
CD80. Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1), but not anti-PD-1, reduced cell surface
expression of CD80 on APCs, and this effect was negated by co-blockade of CTLA-4 
with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4). Thus, PD-L1 exerts an immunostimulatory effect by 
repressing the CTLA-4 axis; this has implications to the synergy of anti-PD-L1
and anti-CTLA-4 combination therapy.
