OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium which has a serious
effect on up to half of the world's population and has been related to different 
gastric diseases. The goal of this study was to assess the frequency of babA,
cagE and cagA genotypes among H. pylori strains isolated from gastric biopsies of
endoscopic patients in the north of Iran.
METHODS: The present study was performed on 90 strains of H. pylori isolated from
patients with gastric diseases (Gastric ulcer (GU), Duodenal ulcer (DU),
Gastritis (G), Non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and Gastric adenocarcinoma (GC)). DNA
was extracted from all isolated strains and PCR method was performed to detect
the prevalence of babA2, cagE and cagA genes using specific primers.
RESULTS: Among 90 samples of H. pylori, babA2, cagE, and cagA genes were detected
in 42.2%, 30% and 82.2% of strains respectively. The statistical analysis showed 
that the prevalence of cagA gene in GU, G, DU, and NUD was significantly higher
than other genes. Moreover, cagA, and babA2 genes were significantly more
prevalent in GC patients compared to cagE gene. Our isolates exhibited 8 distinct
arrangements of virulence patterns. The occurrence of cagA (35.6%) was the most
prevalent pattern followed by cagA/babA2 (20%) and cagA/babA2/cagE (14.4%).
CONCLUSION: In summary, as first report from Guilan province in the north of
Iran, we showed significant association between the presence of babA2, cagE, and 
cagA genes in different types of gastric disorders.
