There is a surprisingly high frequency of allelic variation in complement
proteins. The best candidate for a true selective polymorphism is that of C3. For
C4 and factor B within the MHC it is more difficult to identify the effects of
individual alleles. No evidence suggests other alleles of C4 (and C2) than the
null alleles (or the two isoproteins C4A and C4B) to have any functional
differences with resistance. Thus, the major functions of complement, as shown by
the effects of deficiency, are to resist infection against bacteria and
particularly against Neisseria, and to prevent immune complex disease. There are 
also undoubtedly balancing contributions to the pathogenesis of some infections
and to all immune complex disease. Data from studies of C4 polymorphism and from 
the presence of control proteins on micro-organisms suggest there may be in
addition more subtle contributions to immunity against a variety of other
infections.
