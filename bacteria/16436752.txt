The antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against
multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus
faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter 
baumannii was evaluated. A fast bactericidal effect (within 20 min) against all
bacterial strains tested was observed. The presence of 20% human serum abolished 
the bactericidal activity of hBD-3 against gram-negative strains and reduced the 
activity of the peptide against gram-positive strains.
