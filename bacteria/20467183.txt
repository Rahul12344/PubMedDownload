We report one Japanese familial line in which there were three pulmonary MAC
patients and one suspected patient over two generations, most of whom were
diagnosed with the nodular/bronchiectatic type. In all patients, life
circumstances and bacterial strains differed at the time of diagnosis. This
suggests that the genes thought to affect patient susceptibility to pulmonary MAC
disease may be involved in this family line. Comprehensive genotypic analysis of 
the CFTR gene, HLA typing, and analysis of the NRAMP1 polymorphisms were
performed in seven members of this family. The results suggest that female sex
and menopause might be associated with onset of pulmonary MAC of the
nodular/bronchiectatic type, and HLA-A26 antigen and diabetes mellitus might be
involved in disease exacerbations.
