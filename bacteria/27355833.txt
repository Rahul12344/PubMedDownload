Synthetic studies of the antimicrobial secondary metabolite thiomuracin A (1)
provided access to analogues in the Northern region (C2-C10). Selective
hydrolysis of the C10 amide of lead compound 2 and subsequent derivatization led 
to novel carbon- and nitrogen-linked analogues (e.g., 3) which improved
antibacterial potency across a panel of Gram-positive organisms. In addition,
congeners with improved physicochemical properties were identified which proved
efficacious in murine sepsis and hamster C. difficile models of disease. Optimal 
efficacy in the hamster model of C. difficile was achieved with compounds that
possessed both potent antibacterial activity and high aqueous solubility.
