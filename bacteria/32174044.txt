The infection and treatment (ITM) live vaccination method for control of
Theileria parva infection in cattle is increasingly being adopted, particularly
in Maasai pastoralist systems. Several studies indicate positive impacts on human
livelihoods. Importantly, the first detailed protocol for live vaccine production
at scale has recently been published. However, quality control and delivery
issues constrain vaccination sustainability and deployment. There is evidence
that the distribution of T. parva is spreading from endemic areas in East Africa,
North into Southern Sudan and West into Cameroon, probably as a result of
anthropogenic movement of cattle. It has also recently been demonstrated that in 
Kenya, T. parva derived from cape buffalo can 'breakthrough' the immunity induced
by ITM. However, in Tanzania, breakthrough has not been reported in areas where
cattle co-graze with buffalo. It has been confirmed that buffalo in northern
Uganda national parks are not infected with T. parva and R. appendiculatus
appears to be absent, raising issues regarding vector distribution. Recently,
there have been multiple field population genetic studies using variable number
tandem repeat (VNTR) sequences and sequencing of antigen genes encoding targets
of CD8+ T-cell responses. The VNTR markers generally reveal high levels of
diversity. The antigen gene sequences present within the trivalent Muguga
cocktail are relatively conserved among cattle transmissible T. parva
populations. By contrast, greater genetic diversity is present in antigen genes
from T. parva of buffalo origin. There is also evidence from several studies for 
transmission of components of stocks present within the Muguga cocktail, into
field ticks and cattle following induction of a carrier state by immunization. In
the short term, this may increase live vaccine effectiveness, through a more
homogeneous challenge, but the long-term consequences are unknown.
