Expression of the Pendred syndrome gene (PDS/Pds) is thought to be responsible
for the iodide transport in the thyroid as well as the formation and function of 
the inner ear. Its mRNA is also expressed in the kidney and placenta. We report
here that PDS and its encoded protein (pendrin) are also expressed in the
endometrium. The RNA levels of rat PDS in the endometrium and kidney were much
higher than those of the thyroid, opposite of the pattern of RNA expression in
humans. In human endometrium, pendrin localization changed from the basal to
apical surfaces of the epithelium during progression of the menstrual cycle. This
suggests a possible role for pendrin in cationic ion transport required to
maintain the physiological function of the endometrium. Since there is no
evidence of endometrial abnormalities in patients with Pendred syndrome, it
suggests the existence of a compensatory mechanisms for pendrin's function in the
uterus.
