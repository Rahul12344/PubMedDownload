We report production of chlorophyll f and chlorophyll d in the cyanobacterium
Chlorogloeopsis fritschii cultured under near-infrared and natural light
conditions. C. fritschii produced chlorophyll f and chlorophyll d when cultured
under natural light to a high culture density in a 20 L bubble column
photobioreactor. In the laboratory, the ratio of chlorophyll f to chlorophyll a
changed from 1:15 under near-infrared, to an undetectable level of chlorophyll f 
under artificial white light. The results provide support that chlorophylls f and
d are both red-light inducible chlorophylls in C. fritschii.
