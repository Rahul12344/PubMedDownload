BACKGROUND: The two typhoid vaccines, the parenteral Vi capsular polysaccharide
and the oral live whole-cell Salmonella Typhi Ty21a vaccine, provide similar
levels of protection in field trials. Sharing no antigens, they are thought to
confer protection by different mechanisms. This is the first head-to-head study
to compare the humoral immune responses to these two vaccines.
METHODS: 50 age- and gender-matched volunteers were immunized, 25 with the Vi and
25 with the Ty21a vaccine. Circulating plasmablasts reactive with whole-cell
Salmonella Typhi or one of the typhoidal antigenic structures, Vi, O-9,12, and
H-d antigens, were identified as antibody-secreting cells (ASC) with ELISPOT.
Homing receptor (HR) expressions were determined. These results were compared
with ASC in four patients with typhoid fever. Antibodies to S. Typhi
lipopolysaccharides were assessed in cultures of ALS (antibodies in lymphocyte
supernatants) and in serum with ELISA.
RESULTS: In 49 out of 50 vaccinees, no typhoid-specific plasmablasts were seen
before vaccination. On day 7, response to Vi antigen was mounted in 24/25
volunteers in the Vi, and none in the Ty21a group; response to S. Typhi and
O-9,12 was mounted in 49/50 vaccinees; and to H-d in 3/50. The numbers of
typhoid-specific plasmablasts (total of ASC to Vi, O-9,12 and H-d antigens)
proved equal in the vaccination groups. The HR expressions indicated a mainly
systemic homing in the Vi and intestinal in the Ty21a group, the latter
resembling that in natural infection. Plasmablasts proved more sensitive than
serum and ALS in assessing the immune response.
CONCLUSIONS: The typhoid-specific humoral responses to Vi and Ty21a vaccines are 
similar in magnitude, but differ in expected localization and
antigen-specificity. The unforeseen O antigen-specific response in the Vi group
is probably due to lipopolysaccharide contaminating the vaccine preparation. Only
the response to Ty21a vaccine was found to imitate that in natural infection.
