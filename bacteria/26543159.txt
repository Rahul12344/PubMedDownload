NRMT1 is an N-terminal methyltransferase that methylates histone CENP-A as well
as nonhistone substrates. Here, we report the crystal structure of human NRMT1
bound to CENP-A peptide at 1.3 Å. NRMT1 adopts a core methyltransferase fold that
resembles DOT1L and PRMT but not SET domain family histone methyltransferases.
Key substrate recognition and catalytic residues were identified by mutagenesis
studies. Histone peptide profiling revealed that human NRMT1 is highly selective 
to human CENP-A and fruit fly H2B, which share a common "Xaa-Pro-Lys/Arg" motif. 
These results, along with a 1.5 Å costructure of human NRMT1 bound to the fruit
fly H2B peptide, underscore the importance of the NRMT1 recognition motif.
