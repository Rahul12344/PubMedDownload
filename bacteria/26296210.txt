Inflammatory bowel disease is a chronic, debilitating immunological disorder for 
which there are few effective treatments. New therapies targeting gut homing
molecules, such as CCR9 and α4β7, are currently in development, with some of
these reaching clinical trials. Gut-trophic molecules and their receptors are
critical to the development of both tolerant and inflammatory immune responses in
the gut. However, we know little regarding the function of homing molecules as it
relates to IBD. Data have suggested both pathological and protective roles for
gut homing molecules in IBD development and maintenance. In addition, recent
research findings have suggested that chemokines can influence T cell
differentiation and function. Given the current clinical relevance, it is
essential to obtain a better understanding of the role of gut homing molecules in
the regulation of IBD.
