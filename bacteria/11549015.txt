The endo-beta-xylanase-encoding gene (xynA) of Bacillus pumilus PLS was isolated 
from a genomic DNA library and the open reading frame (ORF) was inserted in
expression vectors for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Plasmid pFN3 harboured
the xynA ORF fused to the yeast mating pheromone alpha-factor signal sequence
(MFalpha1s) under the control of the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene promotor
(ADH2P) and terminator (ADH2T) sequences. In plasmid pFN4, the MFalpha1S-xynA ORF
was brought under the control of the phosphoglycerate kinase I gene promotor
(PGK1p) and terminator (PGK1T) sequences. Autoselective, recombinant S.
cerevisiae [fur1::LEU2] strains bearing pFN3 or pFN4 secreted functional
endo-beta-xylanase when grown in complex medium. Enzymatic activities in the
culture supernatants reached maximum levels of 8.5 nkat/ml and 4.5 nkat/ml,
respectively. The temperature and pH optimum for both the bacterial and the
recombinant xylanase were 58 degrees C and pH 6.2.
