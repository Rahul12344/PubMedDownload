Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight, threatens potato
production worldwide. An important tool in the management of the disease is the
use of resistant varieties. Eleven major resistance genes have been identified
and introgressed from Solanum demissum. However, new sources of resistance are
continually sought. Here, we report the characterization and refined genetic
localization of a resistance gene previously identified as Rber in a backcross
progeny of Solanum tuberosum and Solanum berthaultii. In order to further
characterize Rber, we developed a set of P. infestans isolates capable of
identifying each of the 11 R-genes known to confer resistance to late blight in
potato. Our results indicate that Rber is a new resistance gene, different from
those recognized in S. demissum, and therefore, it has been named RPi-ber
according to the current system of nomenclature. In order to add new molecular
markers around RPi-ber, we used a PCR-based mapping technique, named MASP-map,
which located RPi-ber in a 3.9 cM interval between markers CT240 and TG63 on
potato chromosome X. The location of RPi-ber coincides with an area involved in
resistance to different pathogens of potato and tomato.
