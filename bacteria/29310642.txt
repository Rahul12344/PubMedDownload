BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown that urban particulate matter (PM)
increases the risk of respiratory infection. However, the underlying mechanisms
are poorly understood. PM has been postulated to suppress the activation of
airway epithelial innate defence in response to infection.
METHODS: The effects of PM on antibacterial defence were studied using an in
vitro infection model. The levels of antimicrobial peptides were measured using
RT-PCR and ELISA. In addition to performing colony-forming unit counts and flow
cytometry, confocal microscopy was performed to directly observe bacterial
invasion upon PM exposure.
RESULTS: We found that PM PM increased bacterial invasion by impairing the
induction of Î²-defensin-2 (hBD-2), but not the other antimicrobial peptides
(APMs) secreted by airway epithelium. PM further increases bacteria-induced ROS
production, which is accompanied by an accelerated cell senescence and a decrease
in bacteria-induced hBD-2 production, and the antioxidant NAC treatment
attenuates these effects. The PM exposure further upregulated the expression of
IL-8 but downregulated the expression of IL-13 upon infection.
CONCLUSIONS: PM promotes bacterial invasion of airway epithelial cells by
attenuating the induction of hBD-2 via an oxidative burst. These findings
associate PM with an increased susceptibility to infection. These findings
provide insight into the underlying mechanisms regarding the pathogenesis of
particulate matter.
