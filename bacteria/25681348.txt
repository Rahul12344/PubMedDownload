When Staphylococcus aureus penetrates the epidermis and reaches the dermis,
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMLs) accumulate and an abscess is formed. However,
the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate initiation and termination of
inflammation in skin infection are incompletely understood. In human myeloid
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) deficiency, staphylococcal skin 
and soft tissue infections are a leading and potentially life-threatening
problem. In this study, we found that MyD88-dependent sensing of S. aureus by
dermal macrophages (Mϕ) contributes to both timely escalation and termination of 
PML-mediated inflammation in a mouse model of staphylococcal skin infection. Mϕs 
were key to recruit PML within hours in response to staphylococci, irrespective
of bacterial viability. In contrast with bone marrow-derived Mϕs, dermal Mϕs did 
not require UNC-93B or TLR2 for activation. Moreover, PMLs, once recruited, were 
highly activated in an MyD88-independent fashion, yet failed to clear the
infection if Mϕs were missing or functionally impaired. In normal mice, clearance
of the infection and contraction of the PML infiltrate were accompanied by
expansion of resident Mϕs in a CCR2-dependent fashion. Thus, whereas monocytes
were dispensable for the early immune response to staphylococci, they contributed
to Mϕ renewal after the infection was overcome. Taken together, MyD88-dependent
sensing of staphylococci by resident dermal Mϕs is key for a rapid and balanced
immune response, and PMLs are dependent on intact Mϕ for full function. Renewal
of resident Mϕs requires both local control of bacteria and inflammatory
monocytes entering the skin.
