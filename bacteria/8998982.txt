Microcystis aeruginosa (Synechocystis) is a unicellular cyanobacterium that
performs oxygenic photosynthesis. We found two novel sets of repetitive
sequences, A (REP-A) and B (REP-B), on the M. aeruginosa K-81 genomic DNA, which 
consisted of distinct motifs of tandem repeated sequences located in the up- and 
downstream regions of the orf1 structural gene, respectively. Genomic Southern
hybridization revealed multicopies of REP-A and -B on the genome. Furthermore,
genomic Southern blots of cyanobacteria species with the REP-A and -B probes
revealed that different hybridization signals appeared on the genomic DNAs of all
12 Microcystis strains, but no signal appeared on those of Synechocystis sp. PCC 
6803, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, and Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.
