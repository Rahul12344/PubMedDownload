Complete activation of T cells requires two signals: an Ag-specific signal
delivered via the TCR by the peptide-MHC complex and a second costimulatory
signal largely provided by B7:CD28/CTLA-4 interactions. Previous studies have
shown that B7 blockade can either ameliorate experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis by interfering with CD28 signaling or exacerbate the disease by
concomitant blockade of CTLA-4 interaction. Therefore, we developed a functional 
CD28 mimic to selectively block B7:CD28 interactions. The design, synthesis, and 
structural and functional properties of the CD28 free peptide, the end
group-blocked CD28 peptide, and its retro-inverso isomer are shown. The synthetic
T cell-costimulatory receptor peptides fold into a polyproline type II helical
structure commonly seen in regions of globular proteins involved in transient
protein-protein interactions. The binding determinants of CD28 can be transferred
onto a short peptide mimic of its ligand-binding region. The CD28 peptide mimics 
effectively block the expansion of encephalitogenic T cells in vitro suggesting
the potential usefulness of the peptides for the treatment of autoimmune disease 
conditions requiring down-regulation of T cell responses.
