Caspases, a family of apoptotic proteases, are increasingly recognized as being
extensively phosphorylated, usually leading to inactivation. To date, no
structural mechanism for phosphorylation-based caspase inactivation is available,
although this information may be key to achieving caspase-specific inhibition.
Caspase-6 has recently been implicated in neurodegenerative conditions including 
Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. A full understanding of caspase-6
regulation is crucial to caspase-6-specific inhibition. Caspase-6 is
phosphorylated by ARK5 kinase at serine 257 leading to suppression of cell death 
via caspase-6 inhibition. Our structure of the fully inactive phosphomimetic
S257D reveals that phosphorylation results in a steric clash with P201 in the L2'
loop. Removal of the proline side chain alleviates the clash resulting in nearly 
wild-type activity levels. This phosphomimetic-mediated steric clash causes
misalignment of the substrate-binding groove, preventing substrate binding.
Substrate-binding loop misalignment appears to be a widely used regulatory
strategy among caspases and may present a new paradigm for caspase-specific
control.
