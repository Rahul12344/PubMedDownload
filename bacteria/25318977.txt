Naturally occurring muraymycin nucleoside antibiotics represent a promising class
of novel antibacterial agents. The structural complexity suggests the
investigation of simplified analogues as potential lead structures, which can
then be further optimized towards highly potent antimicrobials. Herein we report 
studies on muraymycin-derived potential lead structures lacking an aminoribose
motif found in most naturally occurring muraymycins. We have identified a
5'-defunctionalized motif to be ideal in terms of stability and chemical
accessibility and have synthesized a full-length muraymycin analogue based on
this structure using a novel fully stereocontrolled route. The obtained 5'-deoxy 
analogue of the natural product muraymycin C4 showed good inhibitory properties
towards the bacterial target protein MraY, sufficient pharmacokinetic stability
and no cytotoxicity against human cells, thus making it a promising lead for
antibacterial drug development.
