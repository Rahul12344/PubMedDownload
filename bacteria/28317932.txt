The evolutionarily conserved processes of endosome-lysosome maturation and
macroautophagy are established mechanisms that limit survival of intracellular
bacteria. Similarly, another emerging mechanism is LC3-associated phagocytosis
(LAP). Here we report that an intracellular vacuolar pathogen, Legionella
dumoffii, is specifically targeted by LAP over classical endocytic maturation and
macroautophagy pathways. Upon infection, the majority of L. dumoffii resides in
ER-like vacuoles and replicate within this niche, which involves inhibition of
classical endosomal maturation. The establishment of the replicative niche
requires the bacterial Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS). Intriguingly, the
remaining subset of L. dumoffii transiently acquires LC3 to L.
dumoffii-containing vacuoles in a Dot/Icm T4SS-dependent manner. The
LC3-decorated vacuoles are bound by an apparently undamaged single membrane, and 
fail to associate with the molecules implicated in selective autophagy, such as
ubiquitin or adaptors. The process requires toll-like receptor 2, Rubicon,
diacylglycerol signaling and downstream NADPH oxidases, whereas ULK1 kinase is
dispensable. Together, we have discovered an intracellular pathogen, the survival
of which in infected cells is limited predominantly by LAP. The results suggest
that L. dumoffii is a valuable model organism for examining the mechanistic
details of LAP, particularly induced by bacterial infection.
