Many proteins in the immune system are also expressed in the brain. One such
class of immune proteins are T-cell receptors (TCRs), whose functions in T
lymphocytes in adaptive immunity are well characterized. In the brain, TCRs are
confined to neocortical neurons, but their functional role has not been
determined. In mouse layer 1 neocortical neurons, TCR activation inhibited α7
nicotinic currents. TCRs modulated α7 currents via tyrosine phosphorylation of α7
nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) through src tyrosine kinases because eliminating lck
kinase expression, coexpressing fyn kinase dead, or mutating tyrosine to alanine 
in α7 blocked the effect of TCR activation. We found that TCR stimulation
decreased surface α7 nAChRs and reduced single-channel conductance. These results
reveal that TCRs play a major role in the modulation of cholinergic
neurotransmission in the brain mediated by α7 nAChRs and that this has a profound
effect on regulating neuronal excitability.
