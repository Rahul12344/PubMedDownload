OBJECTIVES: In accordance with the Precision Medicine Initiative, new treatment
strategies for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are needed to yield 
better therapeutic outcomes. The purpose of this study was to establish and
validate chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells targets in HNSCC.
METHODS: Putative CAR-T antigens were identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas
database. To validate antigen suitability, quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry,
and immunofluorescent staining were performed. A retroviral human CD70 CAR
construct, using truncated CD27 conjugated with 4-1BB and CD3-zeta costimulatory 
molecules, was used to transduce activated human T cells to generate CD70 CAR-T
cells. Cell-based cytotoxicity and cytokine ELISAs were used to measure efficacy 
of killing.
RESULTS: Nine potential CAR-T targets (CD276, EGFR, MICA, MICB, MAGE-A4, FAP,
EPCAM, CD70, B4GALNT1) were identified based on their high expression in tumors
compared to flanking control tissues. CD70 was selected for further
proof-of-principle analysis based on its differential expression in several tumor
subtypes, and showed substantial heterogeneity in individual tumors analyzed.
Cell surface CD70 protein and CD70 mRNA were detected from low to high levels in 
established HNSCC cancer cell lines. CD70 was highly expressed in 4 of 21 tumor
biopsies (19%), and 3 of 4 specimens showed strong CD70 expression on the tumor
cell surface. CD70-specific CAR-T cells were generated and further demonstrated
to recognize and kill CD70-positive HNSCC cells efficiently, but not
CD70-negative cancer cells.
CONCLUSION: CD70-specific CAR-T cells specifically recognized and efficiently
eliminated CD70-positive HNSCC cells. This study provides the basis for further
investigation into CD70 and other CAR-T targets.
