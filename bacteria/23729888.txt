The aim of the present study was to produce exo-polygalacturonase from potent
soil isolate by submerged fermentation and its application for fruit juice
treatment. Pectinase producing strains were selectively isolated from pectin
industry waste. A selected isolate C2 was found to produce significant amount of 
exo-polygalacturonase. The isolate was identified as Paecilomyces variotii on the
basis of morphological characteristics and 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The
exo-polygalacturonase produced by the isolate was purified by ammonium sulphate
precipitation, size exclusion chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. The
purified enzyme had MW of 39.4 kD based on SDS PAGE. Under partially optimized
conditions, purified exo-polygalacturonase showed specific activity of 98.49 U/mg
protein at pH 6.0 and 30°C. The enzyme was comparatively stable from 10 to 30°C
and the activity decreased with increasing temperature. Purified enzyme brought
about considerable reduction in viscosity of fruit juice samples.
