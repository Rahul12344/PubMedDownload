Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) comprise a heterogeneous group of mature
T-cell neoplasms with a poor prognosis. Recently, mutations in TET2 and other
epigenetic modifiers as well as RHOA have been identified in these diseases,
particularly in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). CD28 is the major
co-stimulatory receptor in T cells which, upon binding ligand, induces sustained 
T-cell proliferation and cytokine production when combined with T-cell receptor
stimulation. We have identified recurrent mutations in CD28 in PTCLs. Two
residues-D124 and T195-were recurrently mutated in 11.3% of cases of AITL and in 
one case of PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS). Surface plasmon resonance
analysis of mutations at these residues with predicted differential partner
interactions showed increased affinity for ligand CD86 (residue D124) and
increased affinity for intracellular adaptor proteins GRB2 and GADS/GRAP2
(residue T195). Molecular modeling studies on each of these mutations suggested
how these mutants result in increased affinities. We found increased
transcription of the CD28-responsive genes CD226 and TNFA in cells expressing the
T195P mutant in response to CD3 and CD86 co-stimulation and increased downstream 
activation of NF-ÎºB by both D124V and T195P mutants, suggesting a potential
therapeutic target in CD28-mutated PTCLs.
