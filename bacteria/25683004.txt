MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in the development of cancers. However,
the role of miRNAs in glioma is still poorly understood. In this study, we
demonstrate that microRNA-10a (miR-10a) promotes cell migration and invasion by
negatively regulating the expression of Eph tyrosine kinase receptor A8 (EphA8). 
Ectopic expression of EphA8 counteracts the promotion of migration and invasion
induced by miR-10a. We further demonstrate that miR-10a and EphA8 regulate
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to affect cell migration and invasion.
Collectively, we unveil a branch of the miR-10a/EphA8 pathway that regulates the 
progression of glioma.
