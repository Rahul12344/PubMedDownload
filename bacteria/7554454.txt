Previous studies documented complement activation in sickle cell disease patients
and suggested that this contributes to increased risk of infection. We have
demonstrated alternative pathway activation initiated by membrane phospholipid
changes which occur in sickled erythrocytes. The present studies compared
complement activation products in serial samples from sickle cell anemia patients
at baseline and during hospitalization for painful crisis to examine the
correlation between complement activation and disease activity. Plasma
concentrations of Bb, C4d, and C3a were measured as well as C3 bound to
erythrocytes. Patients were subdivided into those with continuous pain and those 
with intermittent painful episodes. In patients with intermittent pain, there was
little evidence of complement activation at baseline and increased plasma
concentrations of Bb and C3a during painful crisis. Elevated C3a and C4d levels
were observed in patients with continuous pain regardless of hospitalization
status, suggesting a continuous underlying inflammatory process in these
patients.
