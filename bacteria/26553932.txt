Division site positioning is critical for both symmetric and asymmetric cell
divisions. In many organisms, positive and negative signals cooperate to position
the contractile actin ring for cytokinesis. In rod-shaped fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells, division at midcell is achieved through positive
Mid1/anillin-dependent signaling emanating from the central nucleus and negative 
signals from the dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase
family kinase Pom1 at the cell poles. In this study, we show that Pom1 directly
phosphorylates the F-BAR protein Cdc15, a central component of the cytokinetic
ring. Pom1-dependent phosphorylation blocks Cdc15 binding to paxillin Pxl1 and C2
domain protein Fic1 and enhances Cdc15 dynamics. This promotes ring sliding from 
cell poles, which prevents septum assembly at the ends of cells with a displaced 
nucleus or lacking Mid1. Pom1 also slows down ring constriction. These results
indicate that a strong negative signal from the Pom1 kinase at cell poles
converts Cdc15 to its closed state, destabilizes the actomyosin ring, and thus
promotes medial septation.
