In human cells, the ELL family of transcription factors includes at least three
members, which are all capable of stimulating the overall rate of elongation by
RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing by the enzyme at many sites
along DNA. In this report, we identify the ELL-associated factors (EAF)1 and EAF2
as strong positive regulators of ELL elongation activity. Our findings provide
insights into the structure and function of ELL family transcription factors, and
they bring to light direct roles for the EAF proteins in regulation of RNA
polymerase II transcription.
