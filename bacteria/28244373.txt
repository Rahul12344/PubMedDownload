Pomegranate juice (PJ) fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum C2, POM1, and LP09,
unstarted-PJ, and raw-PJ were characterized for the profile of the volatile
components (VOC) by PT-GC-MS. Lactic acid fermentation through selected strains
enhanced the flavor profile of PJ. Concentrations of desired compounds (e.g.,
alcohols, ketones, and terpenes) were positively affected, whereas those of
non-desired aldehydes decreased. Unstarted-PJ mainly differentiated from
fermented PJs for the highest levels of aldehydes and sulfur compounds, and in
lesser extent of furans, whereas alcohols, ketones, and alkenes followed by
terpenes and benzene derivatives mainly differentiated fermented PJs. As
expected, the lowest level of VOC was found in raw-PJ. VOC profile reflected on
the sensory features of fermented PJs, unstarted-PJ, and raw-PJ, which were
evaluated using a consensus modified flavor profile based on 13 attributes.
Fermented PJs were mainly discriminated by the higher intensity of floral, fruity
and anise notes than the controls.
