3-Ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenases are FAD-dependent enzymes that catalyze the
introduction of a double bond between the C1 and C2 atoms of the A-ring of
3-ketosteroid substrates. These enzymes are found in a large variety of
microorganisms, especially in bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria.
They play a critical role in the early steps of the degradation of the steroid
core. 3-Ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenases are of particular interest for the etiology
of some infectious diseases, for the production of starting materials for the
pharmaceutical industry, and for environmental bioremediation applications. Here 
we summarize and discuss the biochemical and enzymological properties of these
enzymes, their microbial sources, and their natural diversity. The
three-dimensional structure of a 3-ketosteroid Δ1-dehydrogenase in connection
with the enzyme mechanism is highlighted.
