AIMS: This study detected and characterized the extracellular DNA (eDNA) in the
biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix of Helicobacter pylori and
investigated the role of such component in the biofilm development.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Extracellular DNA was purified and characterized in a
2-day-old mature biofilm developed by the reference strain H. pylori ATCC 43629, 
the clinical isolate H. pylori SDB60 and the environmental strain H. pylori MDC1.
Subsequently, the role of eDNA in the H. pylori biofilm was evaluated by adding
DNase I during biofilm formation and on mature biofilms. Extracellular DNA was
detected in the 2-day-old EPS biofilm matrix of all analysed H. pylori strains.
The DNA fingerprintings, performed by RAPD analysis, on eDNA and intracellular
DNA (iDNA), showed some remarkable differences. The data obtained by microtitre
biofilm assay as well as colony forming unit count and CLSM (confocal laser
scanning microscopy) qualitative analysis did not show any significant
differences between the DNase I-treated biofilms and the corresponding not
treated controls both in formation and on mature biofilms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide evidence that eDNA is a component of the
EPS matrix of H. pylori biofilm. The different profiles of eDNA and iDNA indicate
that lysed cells are not the primary source of eDNA release, suggesting that
other active mechanisms might be involved in this process. Moreover, the biomass 
assay suggests that eDNA may not be the main component of biofilm matrix,
suggesting that it could be primarily involved in other mechanisms such as
recombination processes, via transformation, contributing to the wide genomic
variability of this micro-organism defined as a 'quasi-species'.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The presence of eDNA in H. pylori biofilm
can contribute to the active dynamic exchange of information aimed to reach the
best condition for the bacterial survival in the host and in the environment.
