Single assemblies of the intact light-harvesting complex LH2 from
Rhodopseudomonas acidophila were bound to mica surfaces at 300 K and examined by 
observing their fluorescence after polarized light excitation. The complexes are 
generally not cylindrically symmetric. They act like elliptic absorbers,
indicating that the high symmetry found in crystals of LH2 is not present when
the molecules are immobilized on mica. The ellipticity and the principal axes of 
the ellipses fluctuate on the time scale of seconds, indicating that there is a
mobile structural deformation. The B850 ring of cofactors shows significantly
less asymmetry than B800. The photobleaching strongly depends on the presence of 
oxygen.
