Plasmodium falciparum infection can cause microvascular dysfunction, cerebral
encephalopathy and death if untreated. We have previously shown that high
concentrations of free heme, and C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) in sera of
malaria patients induce apoptosis in microvascular endothelial and neuronal cells
contributing to vascular dysfunction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and
mortality. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are microvascular endothelial cell 
precursors partly responsible for repair and regeneration of damaged BBB
endothelium. Studies have shown that EPC's are depleted in severe malaria
patients, but the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are unknown. Toll-like
receptors recognize a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns
generated by pathogens such as bacteria and parasites. We tested the hypothesis
that EPC depletion during malaria pathogenesis is a function of heme-induced
apoptosis mediated by CXCL10 induction and toll-like receptor (TLR) activation.
Heme and CXCL10 concentrations in plasma obtained from malaria patients were
elevated compared with non-malaria subjects. EPC numbers were significantly
decreased in malaria patients (P < 0.02) and TLR4 expression was significantly
elevated in vivo. These findings were confirmed in EPC precursors in vitro; where
it was determined that heme-induced apoptosis and CXCL10 expression was
TLR4-mediated. We conclude that increased serum heme mediates depletion of EPC
during malaria pathogenesis.
