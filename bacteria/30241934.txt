YidC/Alb3/Oxa1 family proteins are involved in the insertion and assembly of
membrane proteins. The core five transmembrane regions of YidC, which are
conserved in the protein family, form a positively charged cavity open to the
cytoplasmic side. The cavity plays an important role in membrane protein
insertion. In all reported structural studies of YidC, the second cytoplasmic
loop (C2 loop) was disordered, limiting the understanding of its role. Here, we
determined the crystal structure of YidC including the C2 loop at 2.8 Å
resolution with R/Rfree = 21.8/27.5. This structure and subsequent molecular
dynamics simulation indicated that the intrinsic flexible C2 loop covered the
positively charged cavity. This crystal structure provides the coordinates of the
complete core region including the C2 loop, which is valuable for further
analyses of YidC.
