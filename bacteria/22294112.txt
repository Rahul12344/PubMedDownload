Mortality of sepsis is still high. Crucial for therapeutic response are the early
start of treatment as well as the choice of antibiotics or antibiotic
combinations. β-lactam antibiotics with bactericidal mode of action are often
recommended in guidelines. But this antibiotic class can trigger the immune
system to a maximum by releasing cell wall components or exotoxins. This may lead
to a worsening of the patient's clinical situation. In contrast, antibiotics with
bacteriostatic action often inhibit bacterial protein synthesis with decrease of 
production of virulence factors and minimize release of cell wall components. The
purpose of this review is to summarise the significance of some bacteriostatic
antibiotics and to discuss whether a combination of bactericidal and
bacteriostatic agents may improve the course of the illness.
