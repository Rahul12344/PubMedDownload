Conversion of DDT to DDD by pathogenic and saprophytic bacteria associated with
plants.

Johnson BT, Goodman RN, Goldberg HS.

Of 27 microorganisms examined, 23 plant pathogenic and saprophytic bacterial
species were found to convert p,p' DDT to p,p' DDD under anaerobic conditions.
The range of conversion of DDT (10 micrograms per milliliter) during an
incubation of 14 days was from a trace to over 5 micrograms per milliliter, with 
the majority of the bacteria showing the greatest activity during the final 7-day
period. There is evidence that metabolites of DDT other than DDD are also
produced.
