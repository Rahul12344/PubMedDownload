3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (3-PtdIns) orchestrate endocytic trafficking
pathways exploited by intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella to gain entry
into the cell. To infect the host, Salmonellae subvert its normal macropinocytic 
activity, manipulating the process to generate an intracellular replicative
niche. Disruption of the PtdIns(5) kinase, PIKfyve, be it by interfering mutant, 
siRNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacological means, inhibits the intracellular
replication of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in epithelial cells.
Monitoring the dynamics of macropinocytosis by time-lapse 3D (4D) videomicroscopy
revealed a new and essential role for PI(3,5)P(2) in macropinosome-late
endosome/lysosome fusion, which is distinct from that of the small GTPase Rab7.
This PI(3,5)P(2)-dependent step is required for the proper maturation of the
Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) through the formation of Salmonella-induced
filaments (SIFs) and for the engagement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island
2-encoded type 3 secretion system (SPI2-T3SS). Finally, although inhibition of
PIKfyve in macrophages did inhibit Salmonella replication, it also appears to
disrupt the macrophage's bactericidal response.
