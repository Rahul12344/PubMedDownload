Diagnosis of pancreatic abscess via percutaneous aspiration.

The pre-operative diagnosis of a pancreatic abscess was not considered in a
comprehensive review in 1972. However, advances in technology (Ultrasound--US,
Computed Tomography--CT) has allowed guided percutaneous needle aspiration (PNA) 
of suspected pancreatic lesions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
safety and diagnostic ability of PNA to differentiate acute pancreatic
inflammatory masses from pancreatic abscess (PA). Thirteen patients underwent PNA
after US or CT revealed an acute pancreatic inflammatory mass (12/13 cystic). One
patient underwent a second aspiration. Clinical features T degrees--101.3 degrees
F mean (13/13), leukocytosis 14,400 cu/mm (11/13). Aspirated material was
gram-stained and examined for bacteria and leukocytes and cultured.RESULTS: PNA
was accomplished successfully in all patients. Aspirate revealed bacteria in nine
and pancreatic abscess was confirmed at surgery (8) or post-mortem exam (1). Four
of five patients in whom no bacteria were visualized had medical resolution, the 
fifth had continued T degree and underwent a second aspiration which diagnosed a 
PA. PA contained moderate to large number of PML via aspiration.
CONCLUSIONS: PNA provides a potentially important and safe diagnosis adjunct to
earlier accurate differential diagnosis of pancreatic inflammatory masses from
pancreatic abscess.
