Examination of annexin V binding, an indicator of early apoptosis, on lymphocytes
from HIV+ people immediately after isolation showed that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T
cells were apoptotic, whereas B cell apoptosis was induced mainly after
incubation. CD8(+) T cell apoptosis correlated with fewer CD4(+) T cells, but not
the level of viremia. To determine potential mechanisms for apoptosis, we
examined FasL expression, which was dramatically elevated on CD14(+) monocytes;
however, antibody to FasL did not reproducibly inhibit apoptosis. Rather, CD8(+) 
T cell apoptosis was caused by antigen-presenting cells because removal of
monocytes or addition of antibodies to CD80 and CD86 reduced apoptosis. B cell
apoptosis also involved costimulatory signals delivered by T cells but not
monocytes. A unique CD8(bright)CD28(dim) T cell population died after
costimulation by monocytes. Because this population was increased in patients
with undetectable viremia, abnormal antigen-presenting cells may contribute to
continued CD8(+) T cell exhaustion by inducing apoptosis.
