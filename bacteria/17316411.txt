In lung cancers, lymph node metastasis of cancer cells is one of the most
important prognostic factors, and lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) is very
important in the stage preceding lymph node metastases. Recently, it has been
reported that lymphatic vessel density (LVD) is associated with lymph node
metastasis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between
LVD and LVI based on the immunohistochemical expression of podoplanin or D2-40,
which are new specific markers for lymphatic endothelium. Using 76 cases of
pulmonary adenocarcinoma, the relationship between LVD and LVI, lymph node
metastases, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), VEGF-D or hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) expression was investigated. LVD was significantly associated
with LVI, lymph node metastases and VEGF-D expression. LVI was also associated
with lymph node metastases, histological subtype, VEGF-C or VEGF-D expression.
High LVD, induced by VEGF-C or VEGF-D expression of cancer cells, is a good
indicator of lymphatic metastases and LVI in pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
