mAb-based blocking of the immune checkpoints involving the CTLA4-B7 and PD1-PDL1 
inhibitory axes enhance T-cell-based adaptive immune responses in patients with
cancer. We show here that antitumor responses by natural killer (NK) cells can be
enhanced by a checkpoint-blocking mAb, 14-25-9, which we developed against
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is expressed on the surface of
cancer cells and acts as an inhibitory ligand for the NK-cell receptor,
NKp44-isoform1. We tested for cytoplasmic- and membrane-associated PCNA by FACS- 
and ImageStream-based staining of cell lines and IHC of human cancer formalin
fixed, paraffin embedded tissues. The mAb, 14-25-9, inhibited binding of chimeric
NKp44 receptor to PCNA and mostly stained the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor
cells, whereas commercial antibody (clone PC10) stained nuclear PCNA. NK
functions were measured using ELISA-based IFNγ secretion assays and FACS-based
killing assays. The NK92-NKp44-1 cell line and primary human NK cells showed
increased IFNγ release upon coincubation with mAb 14-25-9 and various solid tumor
cell lines and leukemias. Treatment with 14-25-9 also increased NK cytotoxic
activity. In vivo efficacy was evaluated on patient-derived xenografts
(PDX)-bearing NSG mice. In PDX-bearing mice, intravenous administration of mAb
14-25-9 increased degranulation (CD107a expression) of intratumorally injected
patient autologous or allogeneic NK cells, as well as inhibited tumor growth when
treated long term. Our study describes a mAb against the NKp44-PCNA innate immune
checkpoint that can enhance NK-cell antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.
