Wild birds may host and spread pathogens, integrating the epidemiology of
infectious diseases. Particularly, Larus spp. have been described as responsible 
for the spread of many enteric diseases, primarily because of their large
populations at landfill sites. The aim of this study was to examine the role of
yellow-legged gulls as a source of enteropathogenic bacteria such as
Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and
Yersinia spp., with particular attention to antibiotic-resistant strains.
Enteropathogenic bacteria were isolated from 93/225 yellow-legged gulls examined 
from April to July, during a four-year period (2016-2019). Specifically,
Campylobacter spp. was isolated from 60/225 samples (26.7%), and identified as C.
coli (36/60) and as C. jejuni (24/60). Salmonella spp. was isolated from 3/225
samples (1.3%), and identified as Salmonella arizonae. Shiga toxin-producing E.
coli were isolated from 30/225 samples (13.3%) samples, and serotyped as E. coli 
O128 (12/30) O26 (9/30), O157 (6/30) and O11 (3/30); Yersinia spp. was never
detected. Isolated strains exhibited multidrug resistance, including vitally
important antibiotics for human medicine (i.e., fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines).
Our study emphasizes the importance of yellow-legged gulls as potential
reservoirs of pathogenic and resistant strains and their involvement in the
dissemination of these bacteria across different environments, with resulting
public health concerns.
