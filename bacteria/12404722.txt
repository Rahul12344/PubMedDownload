An Air Sampling Link (ASL), employed in conjunction with an Air Sampling Device
(ASD) or a laser particle counter, has been developed for sampling flowing air
for viable and non-viable particulate analyses. Typically, the ASL could be used 
to sample filtered air supplied to an air shower of a Blow/Fill/Seal machine
operating in the dynamic state. The ASL allows sample volumes of air to be taken 
from flowing air without significant loss from the sample flow of airborne
particles possessing aerodynamic sizes relevant to those found in practice. The
link has no moving parts, is steam sterilizable in-situ, and allows for the
taking of continuous samples of air without the need for intervention into the
'critical zone' of the filling machine. This article describes (i) the design
criteria for the ASL and the ASD, (ii) the rationale underlying the concept of
the ASL design, (iii) the collection performance of the ASL against that of a
conventional sampling arrangement, and (iv) a functionality assessment of the
ASL-based sampling system installed on a Rommelag style 305 B/F/S machine over a 
seven week period.
