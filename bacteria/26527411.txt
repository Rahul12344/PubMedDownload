Homologues of calpain, often thought to be an essential, cytoplasmic,
calcium-dependent cysteine endopeptidase found exclusively in eukaryotes, have
been found in bacterial proteomes. The homologues lack calcium-binding sites,
have differing domain architectures, and can be secreted or membrane-associated. 
Homologues are rare and occur in a minority of bacterial phyla and often in a
minority of species in a genus. However, the differences in domain architecture
argue against a recent, horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryote. From analysis 
of a phylogenetic tree and absence of homologues in archaea, calpains in
eukaryotes may be derived from genes horizontally transferred from a bacterium.
