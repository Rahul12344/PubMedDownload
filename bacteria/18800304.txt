A two-step chromatographic sequence is described for the purification of native
lactose operon repressor protein from Escherichia coli cells. The first step
involves Ni(2+)-based immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography of the
soluble cytoplasmic extract. This method provides superior speed, resolution and 
yield than the established phosphocellulose cation-exchange chromatographic
procedure. Anion-exchange chromatography is used for further purification to >95%
purity. The identity and purity of the lactose repressor protein were
demonstrated using sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide electrophoresis,
crystallization, tryptic finger-printing mass spectrometry, and inducer binding
assays. The purified lac repressor exhibited inducer sensitivity for operator DNA
binding and undergoes a conformational change upon inducer binding. By all these 
extensive biochemical criteria, the purified protein behaves exactly as that
described for the Escherichia coli lactose operon repressor.
