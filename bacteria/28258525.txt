Anthropogenic activities have cumulatively led to the dramatic decline of world
populations of vultures that currently face serious survival challenges in
several regions of the world. In Portugal, the three resident species qualify as 
endangered and are under conservation efforts, mainly in the central east and
south-east regions, where habitat protection and artificial feeding stations were
implemented. Concurrently, the areas under protection are highly affected by
tuberculosis (TB) in cattle and wild ungulates, whose potentially infected
carcasses may naturally or artificially be used as feed by local vultures. In
this work, we opportunistically surveyed populations of Eurasian griffon (Gyps
fulvus) and Eurasian black vulture (Aegypius monachus) for the presence of
Mycobacterium bovis. Nine pathogenic mycobacteria, including one M. bovis
isolate, were cultured from the oropharynx of nine of the surveyed vultures
(n = 55), sampled in recovery centres or in artificial feeding stations.
Genotyping of the M. bovis strain indicated spoligotype SB0121, the most frequent
type in Portugal, and a unique MIRU-VNTR profile that differed in two loci from
the profiles of SB0121 bovine and deer strains from the same geographical area.
The M. bovis-positive griffon exhibited poor clinical condition when admitted to 
the recovery centre; however, clinical evidence of TB was not present. Although
the significance of M. bovis isolation in this vulture specimen could not be
ascertained and despite the accepted notion that vultures are naturally resistant
to microbial pathogens, the sanitary follow-up of Accipitridae vulture
populations in TB-hotspot areas is essential to safeguard ongoing conservation
efforts and also to evaluate the suitability of standing legislation on
deliberate supplementary feeding schemes for menaced birds of prey.
