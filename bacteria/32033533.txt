BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionally affected by
sexually transmitted infections (STI). STI are often extragenital and
asymptomatic. Both can delay diagnosis and treatment. Approval of HIV
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) might have influenced sexual behaviour and
STI-prevalence of HIV- MSM. We estimated STI-prevalence and risk factors amongst 
HIV- and HIV+ MSM in Germany to plan effective interventions.
METHODS: We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional study between February and
July 2018. Thirteen MSM-friendly STI-practices screened MSM for Chlamydia
trachomatis (CT), Mycoplasma genitalium (MG), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), and
Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) using self-collected rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and 
urine samples. APTIMA™ STI-assays (Hologic™ Inc., San Diego, USA) were used for
diagnostics, and samples were not pooled. We collected information on
socio-demographics, HIV-status, clinical symptoms, sexual behaviour within the
last 6 months, and PrEP use. We combined HIV status and PrEP use for defining
risk groups, and used directed acyclic graphs and multivariable logistic
regression to identify risk factors for STI.
RESULTS: Two thousand three hundred three MSM were included: 50.5% HIV+, median
age 39 [18-79] years. Median number of male sex partners within the last 6 months
was five. Sex without condom was reported by 73.6%, use of party drugs by 44.6%. 
80.3% had a STI history, 32.2% of STI+ MSM reported STI-related symptoms. 27.6%
of HIV- MSM used PrEP. Overall STI-prevalence was 30.1, 25.0% in HIV-/PrEP- MSM
(CT:7.2%; MG:14.2%; NG:7.4%; TV:0%), 40.3% in HIV-/PrEP+ MSM (CT:13.8%; MG:19.4%;
NG:14.8%; TV:0.4%), and 30.8% in HIV+ MSM (CT:10.1%; MG:18.4%; NG:8.6%; TV:0.1%).
Being HIV+ (OR 1.7, 95%-CI 1.3-2.2), using PrEP (OR 2.0, 95%-CI 1.5-2.7), having 
> 5 sex partners (OR:1.65; 95%-CI:1.32-2.01.9), having condomless sex (OR:2.11.9;
95%-CI:1.65-2.86), and using party drugs (OR:1.65; 95%-CI:1.32-2.0) were
independent risk factors for being tested positive for at least one STI.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a high STI-prevalence in MSM in Germany, especially in PrEP
users, frequently being asymptomatic. As a relevant proportion of PrEP users will
not use a condom, counselling and comprehensive STI screening is essential and
should be low threshold and preferably free of cost. Counselling of PrEP users
should also address use of party drugs.
