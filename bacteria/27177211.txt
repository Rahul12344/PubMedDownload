Enzyme-activated, fluorogenic probes are powerful tools for studying bacterial
pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In prior work, we reported
two 7-hydroxy-9H-(1,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one) (DDAO)-derived
acetoxymethyl ether probes for esterase and lipase detection. Here, we report
four-carbon (C4) and eight-carbon (C8) acyloxymethyl ether derivatives, which are
longer-chain fluorogenic substrates. These new probes demonstrate greater
stability and lipase reactivity than the two-carbon (C2) acetoxymethyl
ether-masked substrates. We used these new C4 and C8 probes to profile esterases 
and lipases from Mtb. The C8-masked probes revealed a new esterase band in
gel-resolved Mtb lysates that was not present in lysates from nonpathogenic M.
bovis (bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin), a close genetic relative. We identified this
Mtb-specific enzyme as the secreted esterase Culp1 (Rv1984c). Our C4- and
C8-masked probes also produced distinct Mtb banding patterns in lysates from
Mtb-infected macrophages, demonstrating the potential of these probes for
detecting Mtb esterases that are active during infections.
