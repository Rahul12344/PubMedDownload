Objective: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a well-defined risk factor of
periodontitis and it can affect expression of human beta-defensins (hBDs) and
cathelicidin (LL-37) as well. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
impact of periodontitis and T2DM on salivary concentrations of these
antimicrobial peptides.Material and methods: Unstimulated saliva samples,
together with full-mouth periodontal recordings were collected from 92
individuals with periodontitis (63 with T2DM and 21 smokers) and 86 periodontally
healthy controls (58 with T2DM and 21 smokers). Salivary hBD-1, -2, -3, LL-37,
and advanced glycalization end products (AGE) concentrations were measured by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results: Among the periodontitis patients, T2DM
group demonstrated lower levels of hBD-1 (p = .006), hBD-2 (p < .001) and hBD-3
(p < .001), and higher levels of LL-37 (p < .001) compared to systemically
healthy controls. When only periodontally healthy controls were included into the
analysis, higher hBD-1 (p = .002) and LL-37 (p < .001) levels were found in T2DM 
patients in comparison to systemically healthy controls. Salivary LL-37 levels
were associated with HbA1c and periodontitis, while hBD-2, hBD-3 and levels
associated only with HbA1c.Conclusion: In the limits of this study,
hyperglycaemia can be proposed as a regulator of salivary hBD and cathelicidin
levels. Periodontitis, on the other hand, affects only salivary LL-37 levels.
