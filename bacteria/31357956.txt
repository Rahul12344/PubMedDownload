BACKGROUND: Salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) can recur after removal of
the primary tumor and treatment, where they can keep no clinical symptoms and
dormant state for 10-15â€‰years. NR2F1 has been demonstrated to regulate the tumor 
cell dormancy in various malignant tumors and has a potential impact on
recurrence and metastasis of carcinoma. However, the role and significance of
NR2F1 in SACC dormancy still remain unknown.
METHODS: A total number of 59 patients with a diagnosis of SACC were included to 
detected expression of NR2F1, Ki-67 by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick and labeling (TUNEL).
Fisher's exact test was used to examine the NR2F1 expression and
clinicopathologic parameters of SACC. In vitro, SACC cell lines were transfected 
NR2F1 and knockdown NR2F1 respectively. CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing
assay and transwell invasion determined SACC cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell 
cycle, migration and invasion respectively. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 
assays were utilized to demonstrate the potential role of NR2F1 in SACC invasion 
via CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. In vivo, xenografts of nude mice via subcutaneous
injection or tail vein injection were used to testify the results in vitro.
RESULTS: Among the 59 patients with SACC, 23.73% (14/59) were positive to NR2F1
expression, a lower rate of expression compared with 60% (6/10) in normal
salivary gland samples. NR2F1 was correlated with metastasis, relapse and
dormancy of SACC. SACC cells with transfected NR2F1 remained dormant, as well as 
enhanced invasion and metastasis. Knockdown of NR2F1 via siRNA after NR2F1
overexpression restored the proliferation and the cell number in G2/M phases, and
reduced the abilities of migration and invasion. In addition, NR2F1 promoted the 
expression of CXCL12 and CXCR4, and overexpression of CXCL12 at least partly
rescued the proliferation, migration, and invasion activities induced by NR2F1
silencing.
CONCLUSIONS: NR2F1 may be an underlying mechanism of SACC recurrence and
metastasis via regulating tumor cell dormancy through CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway.
