BACKGROUND: Campylobacter and Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are the two most
common bacterial pathogens associated with acute gastroenteritis in children.
This study aims to elucidate the epidemiology of Campylobacter and NTS
gastroenteritis and develop a scoring system to differentiate them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 886 children ≤18 years
of age, hospitalized due to acute gastroenteritis with stool culture-proven
Campylobacter or NTS infection from July 2012 to December 2015. Pearson's
chi-square test and multivariate logistic regression were used to compare
clinical manifestations and laboratory data. Receiver operating characteristic
curves were plotted to evaluate the scoring system.
RESULTS: Seasonality was found in NTS gastroenteritis from May to September, but 
no seasonality in Campylobacter gastroenteritis. Campylobacter jejuni and
Salmonella serogroup B were the most common pathogens. The median ages were 68.2 
and 18.5 months and the incidence rates of bacteremia were 0.6% and 7.1% in the
Campylobacter and NTS groups, respectively. Salmonella serogroup C2 infection had
the highest risk of bacteremia (OR: 5.9, 95% CI: 2.8-12.7, p < 0.001).
Multivariate analysis showed significant differences in sex, age, fever,
dehydration, immature WBC, CRP and Na between the two groups. A score of ≥2
points indicated Campylobacter gastroenteritis, with sensitivity 75%, specificity
77%. The positive and negative predictive values were of 73.3% and 93.9% after
validation.
CONCLUSION: Campylobacter gastroenteritis is associated with older age and male
sex, while NTS gastroenteritis is associated with moderate to severe dehydration 
and bacteremia. Salmonella serogroup C2 infection has the highest risk of
bacteremia.
