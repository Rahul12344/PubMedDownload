Novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitors (NBTIs) constitute a promising
new class of antibacterial agents. We report a series of NBTIs with potent
anti-staphylococcal activity and diminished hERG inhibition. Dioxane-linked
compound 9 demonstrated MICs ≤1 μg/mL against both methicillin-susceptible (MSSA)
and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), accompanied by reduced hERG
inhibition as compared to cyclohexane- or piperidine-linked analogs.
