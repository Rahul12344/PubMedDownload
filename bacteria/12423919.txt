A new PCR-based method has been developed to monitor inoculated wine
fermentations. The method is based on the variation in the number and position of
introns in the mitochondrial gene COX1. Oligonucleotide primers homologous to the
regions flanking the Saccharomyces cerevisiae COX1 introns have been designed and
tested for S. cerevisiae wine yeast strain differentiation. Four primers were
selected for their subsequent use in a multiplex PCR reaction and have proved to 
be very effective in uncovering polymorphism in natural and commercial yeast
strains. An important point is that the speed and simplicity of the technique,
which does not require the isolation of DNA, allows early detection of the
starter yeast strain throughout the fermentation process. The main advantage for 
the wineries is that the must sample can be used directly for the PCR reaction
obtaining very fast results (in approximately 8 h). This allows the wine
industries to intervene quickly if necessary.
