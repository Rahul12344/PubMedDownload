The article reviews the properties of the Galactomyces geotrichum species, the
mould that is most important for the dairy industry. G. geotrichum mould has been
isolated from milk, cheeses and alcoholic beverage. Its presence in food products
makes it possible to obtain a characteristic aroma and taste, which corresponds
to the needs and preferences of consumers. G. geotrichum plays an important role 
in ecology, where the mould is employed for the degradation of various hazardous 
substances and wastewater treatment. It has also been found to have potential for
biofuel production. In addition to this, G. geotrichum can be applicable in two
further major areas: agriculture and health protection.
