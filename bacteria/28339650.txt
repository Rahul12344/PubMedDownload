Rapid freeze-freeze substitution after glutaraldehyde fixation (CF-FS method)
obtained the natural and fine structures of macrophages and engulfed yeast cells.
Culturing macrophages on single hole molybdenum grids placed in culture dishes
made possible the rapid freezing of cells by the 'open sandwich method'. This
method may be convenient when rapid-freezing cannot be performed immediately, or 
when a rapid-freezing device is not available in the lab.
