The thermophilic eubacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus is used as a model to
identify membrane perturbing effects of lipophilic compounds. A parallelism has
been established between the toxicity of the organochlorine insecticide DDT and
its metabolite, DDE, in bacterial growth and the effects on cell functions and
physical perturbations induced at the membrane (Donato et al. 1997a, Arch Environ
Contam Toxicol 33:109-116; Donato et al. 1997b, Appl Environ Microbiol
63:4948-495). In the present work, the use of B. stearothermophilus as a model of
screening for chemical toxicity has been implemented. Because the regulation of
the lipid composition of the membrane is a common strategy in response to adverse
growth conditions, we studied the effects of DDE on the lipid composition and the
consequent alterations of membrane physical properties in comparison to the
parental compound DDT. As expected, different adaptation responses were induced
by the compounds, being DDT more effective as compared with DDE. Collected data
are consistent with the stronger perturbations induced by DDT on growth and
membrane functions. It is concluded that the membrane lipid composition of the
bacterium is a very sensitive criterium to detect membrane-mediated toxic effects
at low concentrations of lipophilic xenobiotics.
