The concept of a folding funnel with kinetic traps describes folding of
individual proteins. Using in situ Atomic Force Microscopy to investigate S-layer
assembly on mica, we show this concept is equally valid during self-assembly of
proteins into extended matrices. We find the S-layer-on-mica system possesses a
kinetic trap associated with conformational differences between a long-lived
transient state and the final stable state. Both ordered tetrameric states emerge
from clusters of the monomer phase, however, they then track along two different 
pathways. One leads directly to the final low-energy state and the other to the
kinetic trap. Over time, the trapped state transforms into the stable state. By
analyzing the time and temperature dependencies of formation and transformation
we find that the energy barriers to formation of the two states differ by only
0.7 kT, but once the high-energy state forms, the barrier to transformation to
the low-energy state is 25 kT. Thus the transient state exhibits the
characteristics of a kinetic trap in a folding funnel.
