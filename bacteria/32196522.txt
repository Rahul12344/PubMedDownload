Phytophthora sojae is one of the costliest soybean pathogens in the US.
Quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is a vital part of Phytophthora disease
management. In this study, QDR was measured in 478 and 495 plant introductions
(PIs) towards P. sojae isolates OH.121 and C2.S1, respectively, in genome-wide
association (GWA) analyses to identify genetic markers linked to QDR loci (QDRL).
Populations were generated by sampling PIs from the US, the Republic of Korea,
and the full collection of PIs maintained by the USDA. Additionally, a
meta-analysis of QDRL reported from bi-parental studies was done to compare past 
and present findings. Twenty-four significant marker-trait associations were
identified from the 478 PIs phenotyped with OH.121, and an additional 24
marker-trait associations were identified from the 495 PIs phenotyped with C2.S1.
In total, 48 significant markers were distributed across 16 chromosomes and based
on linkage analysis, represent a total of 44 QDRL. The majority of QDRL were
identified with only one of the two isolates, and only a region on chromosome 13 
was consistently identified. Regions on chromosomes 3, 13, and 17 were identified
in previous GWA-analyses and were re-identified in this study. Five QDRL
co-localized with P. sojae meta-QDRL identified from QDRL reported in previous
biparental mapping studies. The remaining regions represent novel QDRL, in the
soybean-P. sojae pathosystem and were primarily identified in germplasm from the 
Republic of Korea. Overall, the number of loci identified in this study
highlights the complexity of QDR to P. sojae.
