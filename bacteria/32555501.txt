Chemical investigation of a previously unreported indigenous Australian
Streptomyces strain MST-91080 has identified six novel analogues related to the
oxazole-pendanted macrodiolide, conglobatin. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S
rRNA gene sequence identified MST-91080 as a species of Streptomyces, distinct
from reported conglobatin producer, Streptomyces conglobatus ATCC 31005.
Conglobatins B-E diverge from conglobatin through differing patterns of
methylation on the macrodiolide skeleton. The altered methyl positions suggest a 
deviation from the published biosynthetic pathway, which proposed three
successive methylmalonyl-CoA extender unit additions to the conglobatin monomer. 
Conglobatins B1, C1 and C2 exhibited more potent cytotoxic activity selectively
against the NS-1 myeloma cell line (IC50 0.084, 1.05 and 0.45 µg ml-1,
respectively) compared with conglobatin (IC50 1.39 µg ml-1).
