There is scarce data about the importance of phylogroups and virulence factors
(VF) in bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by extended-spectrum
β-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC). A prospective multicenter
Spanish cohort including 191 cases of BSI due to ESBLEC was studied. Phylogroups 
and 25 VF genes were investigated by PCR. ESBLEC were classified into clusters
according to their virulence profiles. The association of phylogropus, VF, and
clusters with epidemiological features were studied using multivariate analysis. 
Overall, 57.6%, 26.7%, and 15.7% of isolates belonged to A/B1, D and B2
phylogroups, respectively. By multivariate analysis (adjusted OR [95% CI]),
virulence cluster C2 was independently associated with urinary tract source (5.05
[0.96-25.48]); cluster C4 with sources other than urinary of biliary tract (2.89 
[1.05-7.93]), and cluster C5 with BSI in non-predisposed patients (2.80
[0.99-7.93]). Isolates producing CTX-M-9 group ESBLs and from phylogroup D
predominated among cluster C2 and C5, while CTX-M-1 group of ESBL and phylogroup 
B2 predominantes among C4 isolates. These results suggest that host factors and
previous antimicrobial use were more important than phylogroup or specific VF in 
the occurrence of BSI due to ESBLEC. However, some associations between virulence
clusters and some specific epidemiological features were found.
