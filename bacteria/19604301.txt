CCR9 has been identified on T cells as a chemokine receptor that directs these
cells to migrate to the intestine. CCR9 has also been reported on different cell 
types in the intestine, thymus, liver and peripheral blood. Little is reported
concerning the presence of or functional implications of this chemokine receptor 
on myeloid dendritic cells (DC). In the host, DC encounter a multiplicity of
antigenic stimuli to which they mount immune responses. In addition to
intracellular and functional changes on sensing antigen, maturation of DC is
typically reflected in the up-regulation of costimulatory molecules on DC.
However, alterations in other surface markers may also be an indicator of DC
activation. Using bone marrow-propagated DC these studies investigated cellular
maturation in the presence of microbial stimuli and analyzed the relationship of 
CCR9 expression with DC maturation. Fractionation of DC into CCR9(high) and
CCR9(low)subsets revealed a distinct ability of each subset to induce division in
na√Øve CD4(+) T cells. Our results suggest that DC expressing high levels of CCR9 
are less activated/mature than DC expressing low levels of CCR9.
