The incidence of sepsis is increasing worldwide, yet the mortality rate has
barely decreased during the past decades and remains unacceptably high at between
20% - 40%. New knowledge on host-pathogen interactions has greatly increased our 
insights in the pathogenesis of sepsis. It is now clear that sepsis is not only
characterized by proinflammation but also by immunosuppression. Here we give an
overview of the functional interactions between bacteria and our immune system.
Microbial virulence factors, pathogen recognition receptors, activation of
coagulation, apoptosis and a wide range of new mediators of sepsis play a role in
these interactions. Implementation of evidence-based guidelines for the rapid
diagnosis and adequate treatment of sepsis has been shown to be instrumental in
improving survival in sepsis. The increasing insights into the pathogenesis of
sepsis have identified a whole new range of potential drugs which are currently
being tested in clinical trials.
