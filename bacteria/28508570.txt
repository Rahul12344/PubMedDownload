INTRODUCTION: While most transcripts arising from the human T Cell Receptor locus
reflect fully rearranged genes, several germline transcripts have been
identified. We describe a new germline transcript arising from the human TCRB
locus.
METHODS: cDNA sequencing, promoter, and gene expression analyses were used to
characterize the new transcript.
RESULTS: The new germline transcript encoded by the human TCRB locus consists of 
a new exon of 103 bp, which we named TRBX1 (X1), spliced with the first exon of
gene segments Cß1 or Cß2. X1 is located upstream of gene segment Dß1 and is
therefore deleted from a V-DJ rearranged TCRB locus. The X1-Cß transcripts do not
appear to code for a protein. We define their transcription start and minimal
promoter. These transcripts are found in populations of mature T lymphocytes from
blood or tissues and in T cell clones with a monoallelic TCRB rearrangement. In
immature thymocytes, they are already detectable in CD1a- CD34+ CD4- CD8- cells, 
therefore before completion of the TCRB rearrangements.
CONCLUSIONS: The X1 promoter appears to be the ortholog of the mouse pre-Dß1
promoter (PDß1). Like PDß1, its activation is regulated by Eß in T cells and
might facilitate the TCRB rearrangement process by contributing to the
accessibility of the Dß1 locus.
