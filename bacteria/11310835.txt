The bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) is an endotoxin-binding
neutrophil leukocyte-granule protein with antibacterial and anti-endotoxin
properties. A recombinant form of BPI (rBPI21) has been developed and is being
tested as a therapeutic agent to treat gram-negative bacterial infections and
exposure to gram-negative bacterial endotoxin. BPI is also a target antigen of
anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA). BPI-ANCA are present in cystic
fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, vasculitis, and primary sclerosing
cholangitis; presence of BPI-ANCA appears associated with a higher inflammatory
disease activity and greater organ damage. BPI-ANCA as well as ANCA directed at
other neutrophil-granule proteins may exacerbate inflammation by nonspecific
effects of extracellular and cell-associated immune complexes. BPI-ANCA may
further worsen inflammation by reducing the ability of BPI to promote clearance
of gram-negative bacteria and bacterial-associated endotoxin.
