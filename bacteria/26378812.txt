We have previously shown that a specific promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid
receptor alpha (PML-RARA) DNA vaccine combined with all-trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) increases the number of long term survivors with enhanced immune responses
in a mouse model of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This study reports the
efficacy of a non-specific DNA vaccine, pVAX14Flipper (pVAX14), in both APL and
high risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS) models. PVAX14 is comprised of novel 
immunogenic DNA sequences inserted into the pVAX1 therapeutic plasmid. APL mice
treated with pVAX14 combined with ATRA had increased survival comparable to that 
obtained with a specific PML-RARA vaccine. Moreover, the survival advantage
correlated with decreased PML-RARA transcript levels and increase in anti-RARA
antibody production. In HR-MDS mice, pVAX14 significantly improved survival and
reduced biomarkers of leukemic transformation such as phosphorylated
mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1.
In both preclinical models, pVAX14 vaccine significantly increased interferon
gamma (IFNγ) production, memory T-cells (memT), reduced the number of colony
forming units (CFU) and increased expression of the adapter molecule signalling
to NF-κB, MyD88. These results demonstrate the adjuvant properties of pVAX14
providing thus new approaches to improve clinical outcome in two different models
of myeloid malignancies, which may have potential for a broader applicability in 
other cancers.
