After being expressed in Escherichia coli JC5412, which is defective in glutamate
transport, a Zymomonas mobilis gene which enabled this strain to grow on
glutamate was cloned. This gene encodes a protein with 33% amino acid identity to
the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) of E. coli. Although overall
glutamate uptake in E. coli was increased, the protein encoded by the cloned
fragment repressed the secondary H+/glutamate transport system GltP by
interaction with the promoter region of the gltP gene. It also repressed the
secondary, H(+)-coupled glutamate uptake system of Z. mobilis, indicating that at
least one role of this protein in Z. mobilis is to regulate glutamate transport. 
Consequently, it was designated Grp (for glutamate uptake regulatory protein).
When expressed in E. coli, Grp repressed the secondary H+/glutamate transport
system GltP by binding to the regulatory regions of the gltP gene. An lrp
mutation in E. coli was complemented in trans with respect to the positive
expression regulation of ilvIH (coding for acetohydroxy acid synthase III) by a
plasmid which carries the grp gene. The expression of grp is autoregulated, and
in Z. mobilis, it depends on growth conditions. The putative presence of a
homolog of Grp in E. coli is discussed.
