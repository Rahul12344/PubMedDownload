Effective priming of T cell responses depends on cognate interactions between
naive T cells and professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This contact is
the result of highly coordinated migration processes, in which the chemokine
receptor CCR7 and its ligands, CCL19 and CCL21, play a central role. We used the 
murine Listeria monocytogenes infection model to characterize the role of the
CCR7/CCR7 ligand system in the generation of T cell responses during bacterial
infection. We demonstrate that efficient priming of naive major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells requires CCR7. 
In contrast, MHC class Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells and MHC class II-restricted
CD4+ T cells seem to be less dependent on CCR7; memory T cell responses are
independent of CCR7. Infection experiments with bone marrow chimeras or mice
reconstituted with purified T cell populations indicate that CCR7 has to be
expressed on CD8+ T cells and professional APCs to promote efficient MHC class
Ia-restricted T cell priming. Thus, different T cell subtypes and maturation
stages have discrete requirements for CCR7.
