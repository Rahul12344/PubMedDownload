When DNA breakage results in a 3'-PO4 terminus, the end is considered 'dirty'
because it cannot prime repair synthesis by DNA polymerases or sealing by classic
DNA ligases. The noncanonical ligase RtcB can guanylylate the DNA 3'-PO4 to form 
a DNA3'pp5'GOH cap. Here we show that DNA capping precludes end joining by
classic ATP-dependent and NAD(+)-dependent DNA ligases, prevents
template-independent nucleotide addition by mammalian terminal transferase,
blocks exonucleolytic proofreading by Escherichia coli DNA polymerase II and
inhibits proofreading by E. coli DNA polymerase III, while permitting templated
DNA synthesis from the cap guanosine 3'-OH primer by E. coli DNA polymerase II (B
family) and E. coli DNA polymerase III (C family). Human DNA polymerase β (X
family) extends the cap primer predominantly by a single templated addition step.
Cap-primed synthesis by templated polymerases embeds a pyrophosphate-linked
ribonucleotide in DNA. We find that the embedded ppG is refractory to
surveillance and incision by RNase H2.
