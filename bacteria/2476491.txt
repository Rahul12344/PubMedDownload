The 18-kDa protein of Mycobacterium leprae was purified from recombinant plasmids
pUL108 and pML-3 grown in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli,
respectively. Significant lymphoproliferative responses were observed when T
cells from immunized mice were challenged in culture with purified 18-kDa
protein. Synthetic peptides have been prepared that span most of the 148 amino
acid residues that constitute the sequence of the 18-kDa protein and used to map 
epitopes recognized by T cells. When mice were immunized with 18-kDa protein and 
lymph node cells subsequently prepared and challenged in microculture
proliferative assays by using synthetic peptides, only one region of the intact
protein appeared stimulatory. This T cell epitope was located between residues
116 and 121, adjacent to an epitope between residues 110 and 115 which we have
previously shown to bind the L5 mAb. Immunization of mice with peptides, and
subsequent challenge of lymph node cells in assays by using the 18-kDa protein as
Ag revealed that residues 111-125 were the most effective in priming responses.
Furthermore, the ability of 18-kDa primed lymph node cells to recognize
determinants on both M. leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis indicates that in
addition to possessing an M. leprae-specific B cell determinant, the 18-kDa
protein contains a cross-reactive T cell epitope(s).
