The examination of 99 children immunized with adsorbed DPT vaccine revealed that 
the intensity of immune response to the diphtheria and tetanus components of the 
preparation were linked with a number of genetic markers (respectively, HLA-A9,
B35, etc.; HLA-A25, B8, etc.) and their combinations. The groups of children with
high and low sensitivity include an elevated number of persons with the
corresponding titers of antibodies of other specificity. The results obtained in 
this study should be considered in working out individual immunization schedules.
