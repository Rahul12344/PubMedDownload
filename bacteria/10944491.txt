A short-term feeding paradigm in mice, with diets enriched with eicosapentaenoic 
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), was used to study the modulation of T 
cell activation via the T cell receptor (TcR) and the downstream pathways of
intracellular signaling. Diets enriched in EPA and DHA suppressed
antigen-specific delayed hypersensitivity reactions and mitogen-induced
proliferation of T cells. Cocultures of accessory cells and T cells from mice
given different diets revealed that purified fatty acid ethyl esters acted
directly on the T cell, rather than through the accessory cell. The loss of
proliferative capacity was accompanied by reductions in interleukin (IL)-2
secretion and IL-2 receptor alpha chain mRNA transcription, suggesting that
dietary EPA and DHA act, in part, by interrupting the autocrine IL-2 activation
pathway. Dietary EPA and DHA blunted the production of intracellular second
messengers, including diacylglycerol and ceramide, following mitogen stimulation 
in vitro. Dietary effects appear to vary with the agonist employed (i.e.,
anti-CD3 [TcR], anti-CD28, exogenous IL-2, or phorbol myristate acetate and
ionomycin).
