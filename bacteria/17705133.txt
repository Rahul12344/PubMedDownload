We have recently demonstrated that the p38 and ERK1/2 MAP kinases play reciprocal
roles in the control of CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. Although the use of
specific inhibitors for these pathways clearly had an effect, the effects were
not complete, leading to speculations that additional pathways were involved.
Here, we show that inhibiting protein kinase C delta (PKCdelta) substantially
impairs antigen presentation by murine CD1d1 to NKT cells. This effect was
accompanied by marked changes in the intracellular localization of CD1d.
Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of PKCdelta in CD1d(+) cells resulted in
nearly undetectable endogenous antigen presentation, substantially impaired CD1d 
recycling, a decrease in MAPK activation, and a decrease in the ability to
present low (but not high) concentrations of alpha-galactosylceramide at the cell
surface. These data strongly suggest that PKCdelta is a critical regulator of
CD1d-mediated antigen presentation and is involved in multiple steps of the
process.
