Phenotypic assays are increasingly employed to provide clues about drug
mechanisms. In antimalarial drug screening, however, the majority of assays are
designed to only measure parasite-killing activity. We describe here a
high-content assay to detect drug-mediated perturbation of the digestive vacuole 
integrity in the trophozoite stage of Plasmodium falciparum, using the
ImageStream imaging flow cytometer.
