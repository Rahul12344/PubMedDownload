Candida glabrata is a common non-albicans Candida species found in patients with 
candidiasis and it sometimes develops antifungal resistance. Human
beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) is an antimicrobial peptide of immune system active
against various types of microbes including Candida spp. This study investigated 
antifungal activity of hBD-3 and its synergistic effect with a first-line
antifungal agent on C. glabrata clinical isolates. Candida spp. were
characterised in patients with candidiasis. The antifungal activities of hBD-3
and fluconazole against C. glabrata were evaluated using Broth microdilution
assay. The synergistic activity of these two agents was determined by
checkerboard microdilution and time-killing assays. The cytotoxicity of hBD-3 was
evaluated using LDH-cytotoxicity colorimetric assay. Of 307 episodes from 254
patients diagnosed with candidiasis, C. glabrata was found in 21 clinical
isolates. Antifungal susceptibility tests of C. glabrata were performed,
fluconazole demonstrated an inhibitory effect at concentrations of 0.25-8 μg/ml, 
but one antifungal resistant strain was identified (>64 μg/ml). hBD-3 showed an
inhibitory effect against all selected strains at concentrations of 50-75 μg/ml
and exhibited a synergistic effect with fluconazole at the fractional inhibitory 
concentration index (FICI) of 0.25-0.50. A concentration of 25 μg/ml of hBD-3
alone showed no cytotoxicity but synergistic activity was seen with fluconazole. 
In conclusion, hBD-3 has antifungal activity against C. glabrata and synergistic 
effects with fluconazole at concentrations that alone, have no cytotoxicity.
hBD-3 could be used as an adjunctive therapy with first-line antifungal agents
for patients with C. glabrata infection particularly those infected with
fluconazole-resistant strains.
