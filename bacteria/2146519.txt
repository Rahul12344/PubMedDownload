HLA antigens and MLC reactivity were ascertained in 69 families, having
altogether 198 children, with the aim to find genotypically identical donors for 
patients suffering from some type of leukemia or aplastic anemia. HLA identical, 
MLC negative sibling donors were found for 29 patients, i.e. 42.03%. In 55
leukemic patients the frequency of HLA antigens and haplotypes was calculated. No
significant differences were found as compared to the healthy population. One
recombination between HLA-A and HLA-B and one between HLA-B and HLA-D/DR loci
were observed.
