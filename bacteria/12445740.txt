As a tetrameric major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-peptide complex
(tetramer) is capable of detecting antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) 
by flow cytometry, significant information about the generation of in vivo
immunity can be obtained. It is, however, difficult to make a soluble wild type
of MHC class I heavy chain by the prokaryotic expression system. Therefore, we
developed a new method for making soluble mutant HLA-A*2402 heavy chain. In this 
method, signal sequences were deleted, and the codon was changed to silent
mutated nucleotide sequences that bacteria could use as preferable codon. When
purified mutant HLA-A*2402 molecules were examined for the protein generation by 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blotting using anti-HLA
class I monoclonal antibody (mAb) as compared with wild type, a large amount of
mutant heavy chain could be detected. In contrast, the expression of wild-type
stable HLA-A*2402 heavy chain molecule was not detected in this system.
Consequently, by using mutant HLA-A*2402/peptide tetramers, CTL precursors (CTLp)
that specifically recognize antigenic peptide derived from the X;18 chromosomal
translocations of synovial sarcoma were detected in patients' PBL.
