Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired
pneumonia. The Nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome, consisting of NLRP3, ASC (the adaptor apoptosis-associated
speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase-1, has been implicated in
protective immunity during pneumonia induced by high doses of S. pneumoniae
serotype 2. Here we investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the host
response during lethal airway infection with a low dose of serotype 3 S.
pneumoniae. Mice were euthanized at predefined endpoints for analysis or observed
in survival studies. In additional studies, Tlr2-/- /Tlr4-/- mice and Myd88-/-
mice incapable of Toll-like receptor signaling were studied. In stark contrast
with existing literature, both Nlrp3-/- and Asc-/- mice showed a strongly
improved host defense, as reflected by a markedly reduced mortality rate
accompanied by diminished bacterial growth and dissemination. Host defense was
unaltered in Tlr2-/- /Tlr4-/- mice and Myd88-/- mice. These results show that the
NLRP3 inflammasome impairs host defense during lethal pneumonia caused by
serotype 3 S. pneumoniae. Our findings challenge the current paradigm that
proximal innate detection systems are indispensable for an adequate host immune
response against bacteria.
