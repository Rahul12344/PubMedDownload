We report the surface-mediated polymerization of FtsZ protein, the prokaryote
homologue of tubulin, by AFM. FtsZ protein can form filaments on mica whereas the
bulk FtsZ concentration is orders of magnitude lower than the critical
concentration. Surface polymerization is favored by a local increase in protein
concentration and requires a high mobility of proteins on the surface. To
generalize to other cytoskeleton protein, we also show that mica can initiate the
formation of tubulin protofilaments. This study is of particular interest for
studying cytoskeletal protein dynamics by AFM but also for the surface
autoassembly of nanostructures.
