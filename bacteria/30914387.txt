Gastrointestinal Infectious diseases (GIDs) are the second cause of death
worldwide. T helper17 cells (Th17) play an important role in GIDs through
production of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22 cytokines. Because of their increased
activities in GID, Th17 and its inflammatory cytokines can inhibit the
progression and eliminate the infection. Actually, although Th17 have the best
performance in the acute phase, regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are enhanced in
the chronic phase and infection progress through its suppressive function. In
addition, Treg cells prevent undesirable inflammatory damages developed by immune
system components. On the other hand, miRNAs have important roles in the
regulation of immune responses to eliminate bacterial infections and protect host
organisms from harmful effects. Actually, miRNAs can reinforce innate and
adaptive immunity to remove infections. Of note, miRNAs can develop a regulatory 
network with the immune system. Additionally, miRNAs can also serve in favor of
bacteria to reduce immune responses. Therefore, balance of immune responses in
Treg and Th17 cells can influence outcome of many infectious diseases. In
conclusion, there is an imbalance in the Treg/Th17 ratio in GIDs; importantly,
sets of miRNAs, particularly miR155 and miR146, were determined to be involved
clearly in GIDs.
