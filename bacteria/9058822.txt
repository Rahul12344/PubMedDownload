The pathogenesis of septic shock is due mainly to bacterial toxin stimulation of 
the immune system, resulting in an excessive production of proinflammatory
cytokines. TNF-alpha has been implicated as a major mediator in septic shock.
Coinjection of D-galactosamine and LPS or staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced a 
rapid-onset, low-dose form of septic shock syndrome and ultimately led to death. 
We found that both the septic shock syndrome and death could be prevented by
administration of anti-CD28 Ab. The protection induced by anti-CD28 Ab was
associated with a decrease in TNF-alpha levels in the circulation. In addition,
serum from anti-CD28 Ab-treated mice was capable of inhibiting the production of 
TNF-alpha by bone marrow-derived macrophages following treatment with LPS,
indicating that anti-CD28 Ab induced production of soluble factors that
subsequently inhibited the production of TNF-alpha. We confirmed that one of the 
factors present in serum was IL-10, because anti-CD28 Ab treatment stimulated the
expression of IL-10, both in splenocytes and in T cell lines. Furthermore,
injection of anti-IL-10 Abs could abolish the protective effect of anti-CD28 Ab
on septic shock. Anti-IL-10 Ab could also suppress the anti-CD28 Ab-induced
inhibition of TNF-alpha production, either in vivo or in vitro. Thus, we conclude
that ligation of CD28 induces expression of IL-10, which in turn suppresses
TNF-alpha production and prevents septic shock.
