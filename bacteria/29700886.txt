BACKGROUND: P2Y10, along with GPR34 and GPR174, is a G protein-coupled receptor
that is activated by an endogenous lipid mediator lysophosphatidylserine
(LysoPS). Its expression pattern and its function are completely unknown. We have
previously shown that P2Y10 is one of the highly up-regulated genes at the late
differentiation stage during in vitro eosinophilopoiesis.
OBJECTIVE: We explored the expression and functions of P2Y10 in human cord blood 
(CB)-derived and peripheral blood (PB) eosinophils.
METHODS: Real-time PCR, FACS, Western blot, ELISA, and chemotaxis assays were
performed to determine the expression and function of P2Y10.
RESULTS: As CB cells differentiated towards eosinophils, P2Y10 mRNA and protein
were abundantly expressed. P2Y10 was the most highly expressed in the
granulocytes from PB, to a lesser extent in monocytes, and least in lymphocytes. 
Further fractionation of granulocytes revealed that eosinophils express P2Y10
much more strongly than do neutrophils. PB eosinophils solely expressed P2Y10
among the three LysoPS receptors, while PB neutrophils expressed the three at
comparable levels. LysoPS activated both CB and PB eosinophils to induce a robust
ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, LysoPS was capable of triggering degranulation 
of ECP in PB eosinophils. This response was significantly reduced by
pharmacological inhibitors of TNF-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE), epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and ERK1/2, which were known to be required in
P2Y10-mediated signalling pathways. However, LysoPS had no effect on chemotaxis, 
differentiation, or eosinophil survival.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LysoPS provokes eosinophil degranulation
through P2Y10. Therefore, P2Y10 is a potential therapeutic target to control
eosinophil-associated diseases.
