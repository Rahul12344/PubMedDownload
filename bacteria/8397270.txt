To assess the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the appearance of soluble
TNF receptors (sTNFRs), 20 consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of
sepsis were studied as were 7 chimpanzees after administration of endotoxin (4
ng/kg) with or without pentoxifylline. The patients had markedly elevated serum
levels of sTNFR-p55 and sTNFR-p75 compared with healthy controls (P < .0001 for
both receptors). The levels of both soluble receptors correlated with
simultaneously measured immunoreactive TNF concentrations (p55: r = .63, P < .01;
p75: r = .69, P < .001). In the chimpanzees, endotoxin induced subsequent rises
in the serum concentrations of TNF and sTNFRs. Although pentoxifylline reduced
the TNF response to intravenous endotoxin to 20% (P < .05), the appearance of
sTNFRs was only moderately inhibited (sTNFR-p55 to 79% on average, P < .05;
sTNFR-p75 to 77%, P = .12). These results indicate that TNF either does not play 
an important role in the appearance of sTNFRs in systemic infection or that a
small amount of TNF remaining in the circulation after some bacterial challenges 
is sufficient to preserve the secretion of its soluble receptors.
