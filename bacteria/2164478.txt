Previously we showed that certain T cell lines and clones from a lepromatous
leprosy patient displayed a dose-dependent suppression of the proliferation of
autologous T cells to Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae) but not mitogen or an
unrelated antigen. The latter cells were also cloned and did not display this
suppressive activity, were CD4+ and proliferated vigorously to M. leprae
presented by autologous HLA-DR molecules. We shall refer to these cells as T
helper (Th) cells. Most of the suppressive T cell clones (Ts) were also CD4+ and 
also proliferated to M. leprae presented by HLA-DR, but much less strongly than
Th cells. In this study we report on our search for (a) the mechanism of this
apparently antigen-specific suppression by T cells, and (b) a possible phenotypic
difference between Th and Ts clones. The two main conclusions are that Ts clones 
possess a lytic machinery, but that M. leprae-specific suppression and
cytotoxicity can be clearly dissociated, and that the only phenotypic difference 
between Th and Ts is the presence of the CD28 marker on Th and its absence on Ts 
clones.
