A 53-year-old man developed severe acute systemic illness three weeks after an
upper respiratory tract infection. Serial blood cultures grew Moraxella
catarrhalis. During antibiotic treatment, fever and infectious parameters
disappeared, but severe aortic regurgitation developed. Aortic valve replacement 
was performed, during which extensive destruction of the aortic valve was noted. 
Endocarditis due to M. catarrhalis is very rare with, to our knowledge, only six 
cases having been reported to date. M. catarrhalis is a normal commensal of the
upper respiratory tract, but in unpredictable circumstances can become an
important pathogen. Bacteremia due to this organism therefore requires prompt
treatment, as serious organ complications, including endocarditis, can occur.
