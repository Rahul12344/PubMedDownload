Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) may provide a potential source of haematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) for transplantation; however, unknown molecular
barriers prevent the self-renewal of PSC-HSPCs. Using two-step differentiation,
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated in vitro into multipotent
haematopoietic cells that had the CD34(+)CD38(-/lo)CD90(+)CD45(+)GPI-80(+) fetal 
liver (FL) HSPC immunophenotype, but exhibited poor expansion potential and
engraftment ability. Transcriptome analysis of immunophenotypic hESC-HSPCs
revealed that, despite their molecular resemblance to FL-HSPCs, medial HOXA genes
remained suppressed. Knockdown of HOXA7 disrupted FL-HSPC function and caused
transcriptome dysregulation that resembled hESC-derived progenitors.
Overexpression of medial HOXA genes prolonged FL-HSPC maintenance but was
insufficient to confer self-renewal to hESC-HSPCs. Stimulation of retinoic acid
signalling during endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition induced the HOXA
cluster and other HSC/definitive haemogenic endothelium genes, and prolonged HSPC
maintenance in culture. Thus, medial HOXA gene expression induced by retinoic
acid signalling marks the establishment of the definitive HSPC fate and controls 
HSPC identity and function.
