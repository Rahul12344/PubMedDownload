[Role of lectins in allergic reactivity].

[Article in Russian]

Chervinskaia TA, Larina ON, Burlakov GV, Ado AD.

Skin reaction on phytohemagglutinin in healthy people and in patients with
allergic bronchial asthma before and after specific hyposensitization has been
studied. The attempt to determine interrelations between the skin sensitivity to 
phytohemagglutinin and some immunity indexes and to explain several links of
lectins' action mechanisms during allergic processes have been made.
