Human gingival fibroblast (hGF) cells reside in gingival tissues which are
challenged frequently by oral bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from periodontal
pathogens can penetrate gingival tissues and stimulate the production of
interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), which has been implicated in inflammation and bone 
resorption. The anti-inflammatory effects of low-energy laser irradiation have
been reported, but the mechanisms of this biostimulatory effect have not been
fully elucidated. Primary cultured hGF cells were challenged with LPS isolated
from Campylobacter rectus, a known periodontal disease-associated pathogen, and
irradiated by a Ga-Al-As diode low-energy laser (830 nm, 3.95-7.90 J/cm2). The
hGF cells cultured medium showed a marked elevation of IL-1beta production by
LPS, which was significantly inhibited by laser irradiation in a dose-dependent
manner. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis,
this inhibitory effect was involved in the reduction of IL-1beta mRNA levels but 
not that of the IL-1beta converting enzyme.
