Human waste simulants were for the first time converted into biohydrogen by a
newly developed anaerobic microbial consortium via thermophilic consolidated
bioprocessing. Four different BioH2-producing consortia (denoted as C1, C2, C3
and C4) were isolated, and developed using human waste simulants as substrate.
The thermophilic consortium C3, which contained Thermoanaerobacterium,
Caloribacterium, and Caldanaerobius species as the main constituents, showed the 
highest BioH2 production (3.999 mmol/g) from human waste simulants under
optimized conditions (pH 7.0 and 60 °C). The consortium C3 also produced
significant amounts of BioH2 (5.732 mmol/g and 2.186 mmol/g) using wastewater and
activated sludge, respectively. The developed consortium in this study is a
promising candidate for H2 production in space applications as in situ resource
utilization.
