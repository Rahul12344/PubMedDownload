OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanism of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1) regulations of human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) by challenge of
Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) with different fimA genotypes.
METHODS: Pg ATCC 33277 (type I), WCSP115 (type II), WCSP1.5 (type III), W83 (type
IV) were assessed for their inductions of MCP-1 expression in HGF. MCP-1 mRNA
levels of HGF were determined by real-time RT-PCR and MCP-1 protein levels in
culture supernatant by ELISA at different time intervals (1 h, 3h, 6h and 12h)
following continuous co-culture of bacteria with HGF.
RESULTS: MCP-1 mRNA and protein levels were both up-regulated when HGF
co-cultured with different Pg fimA genotypes. Type II was stronger than other
fimA genotypes, HGF expressed significantly great amount of MCP-1 mRNA [(25.75
+/- 3.12)-(326.69 +/- 35.35)] and protein [(178.20 +/- 46.20)-(443.46 82.19)
ng/L] for different time periods; While Type III was weaker than other fimA
genotypes, and the level of MCP-1 mRNA was [ (4.16 +/- 0.82)-(94.17 +/- 18.56)]
and protein [(86.95 +/- 23.90)-(264.01 +/- 28.59) ng/L](P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: fimA genotypes of Pg are related with the inductions of MCP-1, which
might indicate fimA genotype is associated with pathogenesis of Pg.
