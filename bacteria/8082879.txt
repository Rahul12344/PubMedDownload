Superantigens interact with and activate a sizeable fraction of T cells
characterized by expression of specific V beta gene segments of their antigen
receptor. The massive activation of T cells in an organism is considered
responsible for clinical symptoms associated with superantigen-producing
bacteria. Here we studied the in vitro activation of human T cells by the
superantigen Staphylococcus Enterotoxin B on a cell by cell basis.
Superantigen-reactive T cells were stained with a V beta 12-specific monoclonal
antibody and analyzed in a cytofluorograph. Blast formation of SEB-reactive T
cells occurs within 12 h and reaches a plateau after 24 h. Double-staining of V
beta 12+ T cells with antibodies against different T cell activation or adhesion 
surface molecules revealed a time-dependent differential upregulation for CD2,
CD11 = LFA-1, CD25, CD28, CD69, and HLA-DR. The expression of CD3, CD4 and CD5
was not influenced by the superantigen. The rapid phenotypic changes of
superantigen reactive T cells in terms of marker expression and cell size could
provide early tools in diagnosing diseases caused by superantigens.
