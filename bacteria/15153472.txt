There are two major subsets of gammadelta T cell in humans. Vgamma2Vdelta2 T
cells predominate in the circulation and significantly expand in vivo during a
variety of infectious diseases. Ags identified for the Vdelta2 T cells are
nonpeptide phosphate, amine, and aminobisphosphonate compounds. In contrast,
Vdelta1-encoded TCRs account for the vast majority of gammadelta T cells in
tissues such as intestine and spleen. Some of these T cells recognize CD1c and
MHC class I-related chain (MICA/B) molecules [correction]. These T cells are
cytotoxic and use both perforin- and Fas-mediated cytotoxicity. A fundamental
question is how these gammadelta T cells are activated during microbial exposure 
to carry out effector functions. In this study, we provide evidence for a
mechanism by which Vdelta1 gammadelta T cells are activated by inflammatory
cytokines in the context of the Vdelta1 TCR. Dendritic cells are necessary as
accessory cells for microbial Ag-mediated Vdelta1 gammadelta T cell activation.
Cytokine (IL-12), adhesion (LFA3/CD2, LFA1/ICAM1) and costimulatory (MHC class
I-related chain (MICA/B) molecules/NK-activating receptor G2D) molecules play a
significant role along with Vdelta1 TCR in this activation.
