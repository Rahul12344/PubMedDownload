BACKGROUND: Tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial
attachment to the oral cavity. Most studies have focused on prevention of
bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel.
FINDINGS: This study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green,
oolong, black, pu-erh and chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components
(epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral
pathogens (Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 35668,
Streptococcus mitis ATCC 49456, Streptococcus salivarius ATCC 13419 and
Actinomyces naeslundii ATCC 51655) to the HGF-1 gingival cell line. Extracts of
two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced
attachment of all the Streptococcus strains by up to 4 log CFU/well but effects
of other teas and components were small.
CONCLUSIONS: Pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce
attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral
soft tissues.
