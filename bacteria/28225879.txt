Spondylodiscitis affecting the cervical spine is the most unusual type. Disease
progression can be dramatic, even causing quadriplegia and death. We present an
unusual case that progressed with osteolytic lesions between C2 and C3, causing
cord compression and epidural abscess. The patient was treated surgically by a
double approach and improved without neurological deficits and with better
inflammatory markers. We reviewed the current literature on the subject.
