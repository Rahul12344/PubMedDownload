Amyloid fibrils play a crucial role in many human diseases and are found to
function in a range of physiological processes from bacteria to human. They have 
also been gaining importance in nanotechnology applications. Understanding the
mechanisms behind amyloid formation can help develop strategies towards the
prevention of fibrillation processes or create new technological applications. It
is thus essential to observe the structures of amyloids and their self-assembly
processes at the nanometer-scale resolution under physiological conditions. In
this work, we used highly force-sensitive frequency-modulation atomic force
microscopy (FM-AFM) to characterize the fibril structures formed by the
N-terminal domain of a bacterial division protein MinE in solution. The approach 
enables us to investigate the fibril morphology and protofibril organization over
time progression and in response to changes in ionic strength, molecular
crowding, and upon association with different substrate surfaces. In addition to 
comparison of the fibril structure and behavior of MinE1-31 under varying
conditions, the study also broadens our understanding of the versatile behavior
of amyloid-substrate surface interactions.
