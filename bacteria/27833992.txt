The fungal cyclic dipeptide prenyltransferase FtmPT1 from Aspergillus fumigatus
catalyzes a regular C2-prenylation of brevianamide F (cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro) and is
involved in the biosynthesis of a number of biologically active natural products 
including tryprostatins, spirotryprostatins, verruculogen, and fumitremorgins.
FtmPT1, like other members of the dimethylallyltryptophan synthase superfamily,
was shown to have high substrate promiscuity for tryptophan-containing cyclic
dipeptides and a few other aromatic substrates. A previous study demonstrated the
acceptance of 1-naphthol by FtmPT1, but with very low product yield. In this
study, we report the significantly increased acceptance of 1-naphthol and other
hydroxynaphthalenes by FtmPT1_G115A and six FtmPT1_Y205X single mutants as well
as FtmPT1_G115A_Y205C. These results provided an example for creation of
biocatalysts with improved catalytic activity by site-directed mutagenesis.
