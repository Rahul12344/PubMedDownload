Skin cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mounting
evidence shows that exposure of the skin to solar UV radiation results in
inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage, dysregulation of cellular signaling
pathways and immunosuppression thereby resulting in skin cancer. Signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is well known to function as 
an anti-apoptotic factor, especially in numerous malignancies, but the
relationship between STAT3 activation and DNA damage response in skin cancer is
still not fully understood. We now report that STAT3 inhibited DNA damage induced
by UV and STAT3 mediated upregulation of GADD45γ and MDC-1 and the
phosphorylation of H2AX in UV induced DNA damage. Notably, STAT3 can increase the
expression of ATR in A431 cells. Luciferase assay shows that STAT3 activates the 
transcription of ATR promoter. More importantly, microRNA-383 suppressed ATR
expression by targeting 3' (untranslated regions)UTR of ATR in A431 cells, and
STAT3 down-regulates the transcription of miR-383 promoter. Thus, these results
reveal the new insight that ATR is down-regulated by STAT3-regulated microRNA-383
in A431 cells. Moreover, overexpression of STAT3 enhanced expression of
antiapoptosis genes BCL-1 and MCL-1, and depletion of STAT3 sensitized A431 cells
to apoptotic cell death following UV. Collectively, these studies suggest that
STAT3 may be a potential target for both the prevention and treatment of human
skin cancer.
