OBJECTIVE: Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that appears to have both
antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. This study aimed to investigate
the effect of azithromycin on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines by human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) in vitro.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of azithromycin (0.1 to 10 μg/mL) on the
production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), monocyte
chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and growth-regulated oncogene (GRO) by human
gingival fibroblasts cultured in the presence or absence of Porphyromonas
gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was studied. Cytokine and chemokine protein
levels in the culture supernatant were assessed using a Luminex® multiplex
immunoassay.
RESULTS: P. gingivalis LPS induced cytokine/chemokine (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and
GRO) protein production in HGFs, and this effect was suppressed by azithromycin
at all concentrations tested.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that azithromycin suppresses P. gingivalis
LPS-induced cytokine/chemokine protein production in HGF, which may explain some 
of the clinical benefits observed with the adjunctive use of azithromycin in the 
treatment of periodontitis.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The current study examines the anti-inflammatory properties
of azithromycin which may make it useful as an adjunct treatment to
periodontitis. Specifically, we used azithromycin to modulate the production of
pro-inflammatory cytokines by gingival fibroblasts known to be important in
periodontal inflammation.
