Costimulatory signals by CD28 are critical for thymic regulatory T-cell (Treg)
development. To determine the functional relevance of CD28 for peripheral Treg
post thymic selection, we crossed the widely used Forkhead box protein 3
(Foxp3)-CreYFP mice to mice bearing a conditional Cd28 allele. Treg-specific CD28
deficiency provoked a severe autoimmune syndrome as a result of a strong
disadvantage in competitive fitness and proliferation of CD28-deficient Tregs. By
contrast, Treg survival and lineage integrity were not affected by the lack of
CD28. This data demonstrate that, even after the initial induction requirement,
Treg maintain a higher dependency on CD28 signalling than conventional T cells
for homeostasis. In addition, we found the Foxp3-CreYFP allele to be a hypomorph,
with reduced Foxp3 protein levels. Furthermore, we report here the stochastic
activity of the Foxp3-CreYFP allele in non-Tregs, sufficient to recombine some
conditional alleles (including Cd28) but not others (including R26-RFP). This
hypomorphism and 'leaky' expression of the Foxp3-CreYFP allele should be
considered when analysing the conditionally mutated Treg.
