A group of 55 hematological patients treated for the last 2.5 years by the method
of selective decontamination was evaluated. Though both institutes (Bad Saarow,
Hradec Králové) worked on the problem in the same conditions (indications for the
treatment, characteristics of patients, basic drugs), many differences in details
were found. However, the important clinical results were the same: A
statistically significant decrease in infections and duration of fever in treated
patients. A survey of therapy complications, surveillance of infections and
incidence of microbes are presented. The evaluation showed that future research
including microbiological and immunological investigation based on a standard
protocol will be useful.
