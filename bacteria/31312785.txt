Lymphatic filariasis is an infection transmitted by blood-sucking mosquitoes with
filarial nematodes of the species Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi und B.
timori . It is prevalent in tropical countries throughout the world, with more
than 60 million people infected and more than 1 billion living in areas with the 
risk of transmission. Worm larvae with a length of less than 1 mm are transmitted
by mosquitoes, develop in human lymphatic tissue to adult worms with a length of 
7-10 cm, live in the human body for up to 10 years and produce millions of
microfilariae, which can be transmitted further by mosquitoes. The adult worms
can be easily observed by ultrasonography because of their size and fast
movements (the so-called "filarial dance sign"), which can be differentiated from
other movements (e. g., blood in venous vessels) by their characteristic movement
profile in pulsed-wave Doppler mode. Therapeutic options include (combinations
of) ivermectin, albendazole, diethylcarbamazine and doxycycline. The latter
depletes endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from the worms and thus sterilizes and 
later kills the adult worms (macrofilaricidal or adulticidal effect).
