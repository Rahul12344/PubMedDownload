Mycotic aneurysm secondary to tuberculous infection (TB) of the aorta is a rare
and life-threatening disease. We report a case report of a 78-year-old woman with
a tuberculous mycotic aortic aneurysm (TBAA). Early diagnosis and a combination
of surgical intervention (aortic reconstruction and extensive excision of the
infected field) and prolonged antituberculous drug therapy provide long-term
survival without evidence of recurrence after tuberculous aortic involvement.
