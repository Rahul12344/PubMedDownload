BACKGROUND: Nearly 100% protection against malaria infection can be achieved in
humans by immunization with P. falciparum radiation-attenuated sporozoites (RAS).
Although it is thought that protection is mediated by T cell and antibody
responses, only a few of the many pre-erythrocytic (sporozoite and liver stage)
antigens that are targeted by these responses have been identified.
METHODOLOGY: Twenty seven P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens were selected
using bioinformatics analysis and expression databases and were expressed in a
wheat germ cell-free protein expression system. Recombinant proteins were
recognized by plasma from RAS-immunized subjects, and 21 induced detectable
antibody responses in mice and rabbit and sera from these immunized animals were 
used to characterize these antigens. All 21 proteins localized to the sporozoite:
five localized to the surface, seven localized to the micronemes, cytoplasm,
endoplasmic reticulum or nucleus, two localized to the surface and cytoplasm, and
seven remain undetermined. PBMC from RAS-immunized volunteers elicited positive
ex vivo or cultured ELISpot responses against peptides from 20 of the 21
antigens.
CONCLUSIONS: These T cell and antibody responses support our approach of using
reagents from RAS-immunized subjects to screen potential vaccine antigens, and
have led to the identification of a panel of novel P. falciparum antigens. These 
results provide evidence to further evaluate these antigens as vaccine
candidates.
