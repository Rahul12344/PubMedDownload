Treponema denticola adhesion and degradation of fibronectin (Fn) on human
gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were studied by immunofluorescence and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays. The number of adherent bacteria increased and the amount of
immunoreactive Fn decreased as a function of increasing T. denticola
concentration. The distribution of cell-bound Fn was punctate in micrographs.
Anti-human Fn impaired bacterial adhesion to HGF. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
inhibited Fn degradation but not adhesion. Sonicated extracts and diluted spent
growth medium degraded HGF Fn but, unlike intact T. denticola cells, they hardly 
stimulated F-actin rearrangements.
