Type I secretion system (TISS) of Gram-negative bacteria permits proteins to be
secreted directly from the cytoplasm to the external medium by a single,
energy-coupled step. To examine whether this system can be used as an
extracellular production system of recombinant proteins, Escherichia coli
alkaline phosphatase (AP) was fused to a C-terminal region of Pseudomonas sp.
MIS38 lipase (PML) and examined for secretion using the E.coli cells carrying the
heterologous TISS. PML is one of the passenger proteins of TISS and contains 12
repetitive sequences and a secretion signal at the C-terminal region. The fusion 
protein was efficiently secreted to the extracellular medium, while AP was not
secreted at all, indicating that the secretion of AP is promoted by a secretion
signal of PML. The repetitive sequences were not so important for secretion of
the fusion protein, because the secretion level of the fusion protein containing 
entire repeats ( approximately 10 mg/l culture) was only 2-fold higher than that 
of the fusion protein without repeats. The fusion protein purified from the
culture supernatant existed as a homodimer, like AP, and was indistinguishable
from AP in enzymatic properties and stability.
