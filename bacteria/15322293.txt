Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyzes the penultimate step in
prokaryotic coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis, directing the transfer of an adenylyl 
group from ATP to 4'-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) to yield dephospho-CoA (dPCoA).
The crystal structures of Escherichia coli PPAT bound to its substrates, product,
and inhibitor revealed an allosteric hexameric enzyme with half-of-sites
reactivity, and established an in-line displacement catalytic mechanism. To
provide insight into the mechanism of ligand binding we solved the apoenzyme
(Apo) crystal structure of PPAT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In its Apo form,
PPAT is a symmetric hexamer with an open solvent channel. However, ligand binding
provokes asymmetry and alters the structure of the solvent channel, so that
ligand binding becomes restricted to one trimer.
