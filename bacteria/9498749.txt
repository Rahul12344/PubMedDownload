Coupling of membrane Ig (mIg) and CD40 to the extracellularly regulated kinase
(ERK) signal transduction pathway was examined in the WEHI-231 B lymphoma and
normal mouse B cells. Cross-linking mIg induces ERK activation in both WEHI-231
and normal B cells. In contrast, CD40 cross-linking failed to induce ERK
activation in WEHI-231, but signals through CD40 were more effective than mIg as 
a stimulus for ERK activation in normal B cells. However, several lines of
evidence suggest that CD40 and the B cell Ag regulate ERK through distinct
pathways that converge at the level of MEK-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase. Abs to mIg or CD40 induced MEK-1 activation with different kinetics.
Cross-linking of mIg, but not CD40, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the SHC
adapter molecule that couples receptors to Ras-dependent signaling pathways.
Finally, agents that elevate cAMP, causing protein kinase A-mediated inhibition
of Raf-1, inhibited activation of ERK in response to mIg cross-linking, but had
no affect on ERK activation in response to anti-CD40 or Jun N-terminal kinase
activation by signals through either receptor. Thus, CD40 uses an unidentified
protein kinase A-insensitive MEK kinase, rather than Raf-1, to regulate ERK
activity.
