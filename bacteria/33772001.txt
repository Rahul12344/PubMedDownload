Adipogenesis associated Mth938 domain containing (AAMDC) represents an
uncharacterized oncogene amplified in aggressive estrogen receptor-positive
breast cancers. We uncover that AAMDC regulates the expression of several
metabolic enzymes involved in the one-carbon folate and methionine cycles, and
lipid metabolism. We show that AAMDC controls PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, regulating
the translation of ATF4 and MYC and modulating the transcriptional activity of
AAMDC-dependent promoters. High AAMDC expression is associated with sensitization
to dactolisib and everolimus, and these PI3K-mTOR inhibitors exhibit synergistic 
interactions with anti-estrogens in IntClust2 models. Ectopic AAMDC expression is
sufficient to activate AKT signaling, resulting in estrogen-independent tumor
growth. Thus, AAMDC-overexpressing tumors may be sensitive to PI3K-mTORC1
blockers in combination with anti-estrogens. Lastly, we provide evidence that
AAMDC can interact with the RabGTPase-activating protein RabGAP1L, and that
AAMDC, RabGAP1L, and Rab7a colocalize in endolysosomes. The discovery of the
RabGAP1L-AAMDC assembly platform provides insights for the design of selective
blockers to target malignancies having the AAMDC amplification.
