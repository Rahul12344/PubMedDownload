OBJECTIVE: To examine Bifidobacterium mediated induction of human defensin 2 mRNA
expression in human intestinal epithelial cells and define the bioactive
components of Bifidobacterium.
METHODS: Bifidobacterium was cultured in MRS medium in anaerobic incubator and
its cell wall was isolated by sonication and centrifugation. The cell wall
proteins of Bifidobacteria were extracted with 2% SDS. The level of hBD-2 mRNA in
HT-29 cells was detected by reverse-transcription PCR and Northern blot analysis.
RESULTS: There was no detectable signal of hBD-2 mRNA in the unstimulated HT-29
cells. However, the heat-killed Bifidobacteria, cell wall of Bifidobacteria, and 
cell wall proteins remarkably induced hBD-2 mRNA expression in HT-29.
CONCLUSION: Bifidobacterium or its cell wall proteins can induce hBD-2 gene
expression in human intestinal epithelial cells, which may play a role in the
mechanisms of innate defense against pathogens in the intestine.
