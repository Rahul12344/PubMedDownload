Blood to skin recirculation could play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
To investigate this possibility we dissected the phenotype of circulating T cells
in psoriasis patients, calculated the correlation the clinical parameters of the 
disease and performed a parallel bioinformatics analysis of gene expression data 
in psoriatic skin. We found that circulating CCR6+ CD4+ TEM and TEFF cells
significantly correlated with systemic inflammation. Conversely, the percentage
of CXCR3+ CD4+ TEM cells negatively correlated with the severity of the cutaneous
disease. Importantly CLA+ CD4+ TCM cells expressing CCR6+ or CCR4+CXCR3+
negatively correlated with psoriasis severity suggesting recruitment to the skin 
compartment. This assumption was reinforced by gene expression data showing
marked increase of CCR7 and CLA-encoding gene SELPLG expression in psoriatic skin
and strong association of their expression. The data enlightens a role for CD4+ T
cells trafficking between blood and skin in cutaneous and systemic manifestations
of psoriasis.
