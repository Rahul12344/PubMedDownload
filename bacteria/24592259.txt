The formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) constitute a frequent event during the
production of heterologous proteins in bacterial hosts. Although the mechanisms
leading to their formation are not completely understood, empirical data have
been exploited trying to predict the aggregation propensity of specific proteins 
while a great number of strategies have been developed to avoid the generation of
IBs. However, in many cases, the formation of such aggregates can be considered
an advantage for basic research as for protein production. In this review, we
focus on this positive side of IBs formation in bacteria. We present a
compilation on recent advances on the understanding of IBs formation and their
utilization as a model to understand protein aggregation and to explore
strategies to control this process. We include recent information about their
composition and structure, their use as an attractive approach to produce low
cost proteins and other promising applications in Biomedicine.
