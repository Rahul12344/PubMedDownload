The aim of this work was to compare biological activities of three variants of
bacterially expressed human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) with additional
protein domains: 6His-s-tag-EPO protein carrying the s-tag (15-a.a. oligopeptide 
from bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A) at the N-terminus and HBD-EPO and EPO-HBD 
proteins containing heparin-binding protein domains (HBD) of the bone
morphogenetic protein 2 from Danio rerio at the N- and C-termini, respectively.
The commercial preparation Epostim (LLC Pharmapark, Russia) produced by synthesis
in Chinese hamster ovary cells was used for comparison. The EPO variant with the 
C-terminal HBD domain connected by a rigid linker (EPO-HBD) possesses the best
properties as compared to HBD-EPO with the reverse domain arrangement. It was ~13
times more active in vitro (i.e., promoted proliferation of human erythroleukemia
TF-1 cells) and demonstrated a higher rate of association with the erythropoietin
receptor. EPO-HBD also exhibited the greatest binding to the demineralized bone
matrix (DBM) and more prolonged release from the DBM among the four proteins
studied. Subcutaneous administration of EPO-HBD immobilized on DBM resulted in
significantly more pronounced vascularization of surrounding tissues in
comparison with the other proteins and DBM alone. Therefore, EPO-HBD displayed
better performance with regard to all the investigated parameters than other
examined EPO variants, and it seems promising to study the possibility of its
medical use.
