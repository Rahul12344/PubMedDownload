Background: Macrolides have been associated with favorable immunological effects 
in various inflammatory disease states. We investigated the association between
macrolide therapy and mortality in patients with the acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS).
Methods: This was an unplanned secondary analysis of patients with ARDS within a 
large prospective observational study of critically ill patients in the intensive
care units (ICUs) of two university-affiliated hospitals in the Netherlands. The 
exposure of interest was low-dose macrolide use prescribed for another reason
than infection; we excluded patients who received high-dose macrolides for an
infection. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. The association between
macrolide therapy and mortality was determined in the whole cohort, as well as in
a propensity score matched cohort; the association was compared between pulmonary
versus non-pulmonary ARDS, and between two biological phenotypes based on plasma 
levels of 20 biomarkers.
Results: In total, 873 patients with ARDS were analyzed, of whom 158 patients
(18%) received macrolide therapy during stay in ICU for a median duration of 3
(interquartile range, 1-4) days. Erythromycin was the most frequent prescribed
macrolide (97%). Macrolide therapy was associated with reduced 30-day mortality
in the whole cohort [22.8% vs. 31.6%; crude odds ratio (OR), 0.64 (interquartile 
range, 0.43-0.96), P=0.03]. The association in the propensity score matched
cohort remained significant [22.8% vs. 32.9%; OR, 0.62 (interquartile range,
0.39-0.96), P=0.03]. Propensity matched associations with mortality were
different in patients with non-pulmonary ARDS vs. pulmonary ARDS and also varied 
by biological phenotype.
Conclusions: These data together show that low-dose macrolide therapy prescribed 
for another reason than infection is associated with decreased mortality in
patients with ARDS.
