We have applied immunoassays for complement activation products C4d, fragment Bb 
and the protein S-C5b-9 neoantigen (S-MAC) to assess activation of classical,
alternative and terminal pathways, respectively, by lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
from the smooth strain (SS) of Salmonella minnesota and the shallow rough (core) 
mutants R60, R345, R5 and R7. Incubations of sera (n = 6) with LPS generated
small and insignificant quantities of Bb and S-MAC in the case of Rb, Rc and Rd
chemotypes and slightly greater quantities with Ra. SS-LPS brought about
significant (p = 0.01) increases in the formation of both Bb and S-MAC. No
significant changes were observed in the concentration of C4d. Polymyxin B
enhanced Bb and S-MAC production by SS-LPS, optimally at the lowest concentration
of polymyxin B studied, 10 ng/ml. These data confirm and extend observations
about complement activation by LPS and suggest that immunoassay may be useful in 
studying mechanisms of complement activation.
