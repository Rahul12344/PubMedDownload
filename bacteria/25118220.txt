PATIENT: 47-year-old African American man.
CHIEF COMPLAINT: Initially, serious finger abscess. The patient reported severe
pain that was localized to that finger only.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: His finger had become sore and then progressively
more painful and swollen.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: A few weeks earlier, the patient had had a similar abscess 
on his leg; he could not recall any specific injuries other than this. He had a
past history of epilepsy that is totally unrelated to this case; he had not had
any episodes in more than 10 years. Otherwise, the medical history of the patient
was relatively healthy: he is a nonsmoker with no history of diabetes or steroid 
use.
SOCIAL HISTORY: Patient washed cars for a living.
FAMILY HISTORY: Noncontributory.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Initially, the patient was sent home with a course of
antibiotics (cephalexin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) and was asked to
return to the hospital for follow up within two days. By the time of the
follow-up visit, the antibiotic treatment had been unsuccessful, and the patient 
experienced more pain in the finger; the flesh of the finger was becoming black
and necrotic. The patient tested positive for all myeloid markers:
myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD34, CD33, CD13, CD45, human leukocyte antigenâ€“DR
subregion (HLA-DR), CD15, and CD11c. Trilinear dysplasia was indicated by the
results of bone-marrow studies and peripheral blood smear testing.
