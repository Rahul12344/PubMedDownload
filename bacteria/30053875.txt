BACKGROUND: Slaughter pigs are monitored for the presence of the zoonotic
pathogen Salmonella, using both serology and bacteriology. ELISAs used to
investigate pig herds are based on the detection of antibodies against components
of the Salmonella cell envelope. Nearly all Salmonella isolates in food-producing
animals are serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, distributed over
various serogroups as determined by the composition of their lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). ELISAs for Salmonella serology are usually based on serogroup B and C1
LPS, often combined with serogroup D or E LPS. Although C2 LPS may improve
serology, use of C2 LPS in a broad ELISA was never achieved.
RESULTS: To enable detection of serum antibodies against Salmonella in pigs, a
bead-based suspension array was developed with five LPS variants (B, 2Ã— C1, C2,
D1), each conjugated to a different bead set using triazine chemistry. Reactivity
of the beads was confirmed with rabbit agglutination sera and with experimental
pig sera. With a mixture of bead sets, 175 sera from slaughter pigs were
investigated for the presence of antibodies against Salmonella. With a
combination of ROC analysis (B and D LPS) and a prevalence estimation based on
historic data (C LPS), individual cut-offs were defined for each LPS-conjugated
bead set, and assay performance was evaluated. Results of the suspension array
(BC1C1C2D) suggest that more pigs are seroconverted than indicated by a
commercial BC1D1-ELISA, and that most of these extra seropositive samples give a 
signal on one of the beads with C LPS. These results show that expansion of a
standard panel with more C LPS variants improves antibody detection.
CONCLUSIONS: A suspension array for Salmonella serology in pigs was developed,
that detects more seropositive sera than ELISA, which is achieved by expanding
the panel of Salmonella LPS variants, including C2 LPS. The results demonstrate
that bead-based suspension arrays allow for testing of pig sera, with the
advantage of being able to set cut-offs per antigen. Ultimately, this type of
assay can be applied in routine veterinary serology to test for antibodies
against multiple Salmonella serovars (or other pathogens) in one single serum
sample, using up-to-date antigen panels.
