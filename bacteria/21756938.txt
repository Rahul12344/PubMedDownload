Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play an important role in the immunity of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. In the present study, the
identification of novel CTL epitopes from efflux pumps, Rv1258c and Rv1410c, was 
reported. Candidate native peptides and their analogues were predicted with
prediction programs. Rv1410c-p510 (TLAPQVEPL) and Rv1410c-p510-1Y9V (YLAPQVEPV)
showed potent binding affinity and stability towards HLA-A*0201 molecule. In
enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, the CTLs induced from peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by these peptides could release interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in
at least one healthy donor (HLA-A*02(+), PPD(+)). In cytotoxicity assay in vitro 
and in vivo, the CTLs induced by Rv1410c-p510-1Y9V could specifically lyse
peptide-loaded T2 cells. This is the first report to identify CTL epitopes from
the efflux pumps of Mtb. The novel epitope identified could serve as candidate to
the multivalent peptide vaccine against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis.
