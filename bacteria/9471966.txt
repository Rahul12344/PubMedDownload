Comparative study of the toxic actions of
2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane and
2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene on the growth and respiratory
activity of a microorganism used as a model.

A strain of Bacillus stearothermophilus was used as a model for a comparative
study of the toxic effect of 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane and
2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene. Bacterial growth, the O2
consumption rate, and respiration-related enzymatic activities provided
quantitative data in agreement with results reported for other systems. The use
of this bacterium for screening for chemical toxicity is discussed.
