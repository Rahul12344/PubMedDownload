The eye generally is considered to be an immune-privileged organ, but this notion
is being increasingly challenged as ocular antigens can be expressed in the
generative lymphoid organs, resulting in attainment of self-tolerance. What
triggers a break in this tolerant state is a fundamental question in autoimmunity
research. The general belief is that exposure to environmental microbes can break
self-tolerance in genetically susceptible individuals, leading to the induction
of autoimmune responses. The molecular mimicry hypothesis has been proposed as
one major mechanistic, pathway through which microbes, by generating
cross-reactive immune responses, can induce ocular damage of the kind that might 
occur in uveitis. However, our recent data suggest that exposure to microbial
products containing mimicry epitopes for retinal antigens can potentially be
beneficial to the host. In this review, we discuss the immune mechanisms with
particular reference to the molecular mimicry hypothesis as it relates to
immune-mediated uveitis.
