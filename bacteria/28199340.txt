Unusual outbreaks of food poisoning in Japan were reported in which Clostridium
perfringens was strongly suspected to be the cause based on epidemiological
information and fingerprinting of isolates. The isolated strains lack the typical
C. perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) but secrete a new enterotoxin consisting of two 
components: C. perfringens iota-like enterotoxin-a (CPILE-a), which acts as an
enzymatic ADP-ribosyltransferase, and CPILE-b, a membrane binding component. Here
we present the crystal structures of apo-CPILE-a, NAD+-CPILE-a and NADH-CPILE-a. 
Though CPILE-a structure has high similarity with known iota toxin-a (Ia) with
NAD+, it possesses two extra-long protruding loops from G262-S269 and E402-K408
that are distinct from Ia. Based on the Ia-actin complex structure, we focused on
actin-binding interface regions (I-V) including two protruding loops (PT) and
examined how mutations in these regions affect the ADP-ribosylation activity of
CPILE-a. Though some site-directed mutagenesis studies have already been
conducted on the actin binding site of Ia, in the present study, mutagenesis
studies were conducted against both α- and β/γ-actin in CPILE-a and Ia.
Interestingly, CPILE-a ADP-ribosylates both α- and β/γ-actin, but its sensitivity
towards β/γ-actin is 36% compared with α-actin. Our results contrast to that only
C2-I ADP-ribosylates β/γ-actin. We also showed that PT-I and two convex-concave
interactions in CPILE-a are important for actin binding. The current study is the
first detailed analysis of site-directed mutagenesis in the actin binding region 
of Ia and CPILE-a against both α- and β/γ-actin.
