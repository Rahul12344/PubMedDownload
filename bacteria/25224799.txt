Mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses an unusually high number of genes involved
in the metabolism of lipids. Driven by a newly described esterase motif SXXK in
the amino acid sequence and a predicted signal peptide, the gene rv3036c from M. 
tuberculosis was cloned and characterized biochemically. Rv3036c efficiently
hydrolyzes soluble p-nitrophenyl esters but not emulsified lipid. The highest
activity of this enzyme was observed when p-nitrophenyl acetate (C2) was used as 
the substrate. Based on the activities, Rv3036c was classified as a nonlipolytic 
hydrolase. The results of immunoreactivity studies on the subcellular
mycobacterial fractions suggested that the enzyme was present in the cell wall
and cell membrane in mycobacteria. In summary, Rv3036c was characterized as a
novel cell wall-anchored esterase from M. tuberculosis.
