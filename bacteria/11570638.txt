Staphylococcal Enterotoxin-A(SEA), a 27kDa monomeric protein, produced by some
strains of Staphylococcus aureus, is a prototype T-cell superantigen which causes
proliferation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and produces cytokines like TNF-alpha
and IFN-gamma. Recently Protein A (PA), a 42 kDa membrane protein of the
Staphylococcus aureus Cowan-I strain, has been termed a B-cell super antigen. It 
has been shown to cause multiple immunological responses. In the present study we
examined the effect of these two superantigens used separately as well as
combination in a normal mouse system. It has been shown that combination
treatment of PA and SEA is more effective than that of each individual one. FACS 
analyses of cell cycles showed that a finely turned cellular collaboration
occurred in various phases of cell growth and proliferative response compared
with controls (P<0.01). It has also been shown that the percentage of various
cell types bearing different clusters of differentiation markers, e.g., CD8+,
CD34+ increases considerably due to the combined effect of PA and SEA. We also
observed that co-administration of both the elicits different soluble mediators
like cytokines (TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL-1beta). No apoptotic phenomenon was
observed (from the cell cycle analysis) for the dose of PA and SEA, used for the 
experiments, suggesting that these doses of PA and SEA should be non-toxic.
