Given the increasing commercial and clinical relevance of probiotic cultures,
improving their stress tolerance profile and ability to overcome the
physiochemical defences of the host is an important biological goal. Pathogenic
bacteria have evolved sophisticated strategies to overcome host defences,
interact with the immune system and interfere with essential host systems. We
coin the term 'patho-biotechnology' to describe the exploitation of these
valuable traits in biotechnology and biomedicine. This approach shows promise for
the design of more technologically robust and effective probiotic cultures with
improved biotechnological and clinical applications as well as the development of
novel vaccine and drug delivery platforms.
