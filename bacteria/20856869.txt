Previously, we reported that Galactoxylomannan (GalXM) activates the extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways through an interaction with the glycoreceptors
on T cells. In this study we establish the role of the glycoreceptor CD45 in
GalXM-induced T cell apoptosis, using CD45(+/+) and CD45(-/-) cell lines, derived
from BW5147 murine T cell lymphoma. Our results show that whereas CD45 expression
is not required for GalXM association by the cells, it is essential for apoptosis
induction. In CD45(+/+) cells, CD45 triggering by GalXM reduces the activation of
Lck, ZAP70 and Erk1/2. Conversely, in CD45(-/-) cells, Lck was
hyperphosphorylated and did not show any modulation after GalXM stimulation. On
the whole, our findings provide evidence that the negative regulation of Lck
activation occurs via CD45 engagement. This appears to be related to the capacity
of GalXM to antagonize T cell activation and induce T cell death. Overall this
mechanism may be responsible for the immune paralysis that follows GalXM
administration and could explain the powerful immunosuppression that accompanies 
cryptococcosis.
