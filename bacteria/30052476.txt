Bacillus anthracis secretes a three component exotoxin-complex, which contributes
to anthrax pathogenesis. Formation of this complex starts with the binding of
protective antigen (PA) to its cellular receptor. In this study, we report that
PA is a calcium-dependent serine protease and that the protein potentially uses
this proteolytic activity for receptor binding. Additionally our findings shed
new light on previous research describing the inhibition of anthrax toxins and
exotoxin formation. Importantly, inhibition of the proteolytic activity of
protective antigen could be a novel therapeutic strategy in fighting B.
anthracis-related infections.
