Overproduction of genetically engineered antibodies, such as single-chain
antibodies (scAbs) in Escherichia coli often results in insoluble and inactive
products known as inclusion bodies. We now report that fusion or co-expression of
FkpA, the E. coli periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase with chaperone activity, 
substantially improves soluble and functional expression of scAbs. Anti-human
bladder carcinoma scAb (PG) and anti-human CD3 x anti-human ovarian
carcinoma-bispecific scAb (BH1) were fused with FkpA on the pTMF-based plasmid
and expressed in E. coli. More than half of the amount of each expressed fusion
protein FkpA-PG or FkpA-BH1 was soluble. In addition, the fusion protein
cellulose-binding domain from Cellulomonas fimi (CBD)-PG and anti-human CD3 x
anti-human CD28 x anti-human ovarian carcinoma-trispecific scAb (TRI) fused to
the pelB (a signal peptide from pectate lysase B of a Bacillus sp.) signal
sequence were co-expressed with FkpA under the control of the T7 promoter. A
substantial portion of the co-expressed CBD-PG or TRI was soluble. Furthermore,
PG, BH1, and TRI were biologically active as judged by ELISA and in vitro
cytotoxicity assay. These results suggest that overexpression of FkpA should be
useful in expressing heterologous proteins in E. coli.
