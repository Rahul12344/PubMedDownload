Concealing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) is a principal strategy
used by fungi to avoid immune recognition. Surface exposure of PAMPs during
germination can leave the pathogen vulnerable. Accordingly, β-glucan surface
exposure during Aspergillus fumigatus germination activates an Atg5-dependent
autophagy pathway termed LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), which promotes fungal
killing. We found that LAP activation also requires the genetic, biochemical or
biological (germination) removal of A. fumigatus cell wall melanin. The
attenuated virulence of melanin-deficient A. fumigatus is restored in
Atg5-deficient macrophages and in mice upon conditional inactivation of Atg5 in
hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, Aspergillus melanin inhibits NADPH
oxidase-dependent activation of LAP by excluding the p22phox subunit from the
phagosome. Thus, two events that occur concomitantly during germination of
airborne fungi, surface exposure of PAMPs and melanin removal, are necessary for 
LAP activation and fungal killing. LAP blockade is a general property of melanin 
pigments, a finding with broad physiological implications.
