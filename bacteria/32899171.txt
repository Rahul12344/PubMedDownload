For about 10 years, a new variant of the pathogen Trichophyton (T.) benhamiae has
appeared in Germany, characterized by a previously unobserved culture phenotype
with a strong yellow reverse. A few studies suggest that this new variety is now 
the most common zoophilic dermatophyte in Germany. The guinea pig is the main
carrier. Exact prevalence measurements are not yet available. Thus, the aim of
our ongoing study was to collect data on the frequency and geographic
distribution of the pathogen and its phenotypes (white and yellow) in humans and 
guinea pigs throughout Germany. Our former studies have already shown that
animals from large breeding farms are particularly heavily affected. In contrast 
to this, 21 small, private breedings were sampled and husbandry conditions
recorded. This placed us in a position to identify propagation factors and to
give recommendations for containment. For animals from private breedings, we
detected T. benhamiae with a prevalence of 55.4%, which is a reduction of nearly 
40% compared with animals from large breeding farms. As risk factors, we
identified the type of husbandry and the contact to other breedings. Furthermore,
certain animal races, like Rex guinea pigs and races with long hair in
combination with curls were predestined for colonization with T. benhamiae due to
their phenotypic coat characteristics. A prevalence for infections with T.
benhamiae of 36.2% has been determined for symptomatic pet guinea pigs suspected 
of having dermatophytosis and is comparable to the study of Kraemer et al.
showing a prevalence of 34.9% in 2009 in Germany. The prevalence in humans is
stable with about 2-3% comparing the data of 2010-2013 and 2018 in Thuringia. The
new type of T. benhamiae was by far the most frequent cause in all settings.
