Cyanobacteria alkane synthetic pathway has been heterologously constructed in
many microbial hosts. It is by far the most studied and reliable alkane
generating pathway. Aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (i.e., ADO, key enzyme in
this pathway) obtained from different cyanobacteria species showed diverse
catalytic abilities. This work indicated that single aldehyde reductase deletions
were beneficial to Nostoc punctiforme ADO-depended alkane production in
Escherichia coli even better than double deletions. Fatty acid metabolism
regulator (FadR) overexpression and low temperature increased C18:1 fatty acid
supply, and in turn stimulated C18:1-derived heptadecene production, suggesting
that supplying ADO with preferred substrate was important to overall alkane yield
improvement. Using combinational methods, 1Â g/L alkane was obtained in fed-batch 
fermentation with heptadecene accounting for nearly 84% of total alkane.
