Peptide antigen presentation by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
proteins initiates CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity against pathogens and cancers.
MHC I molecules typically bind peptides with 9 amino acids in length with both
ends tucked inside the major A and F binding pockets. It has been known for a
while that longer peptides can also bind by either bulging out of the groove in
the middle of the peptide or by binding in a zigzag fashion inside the groove. In
a recent study, we identified an alternative binding conformation of naturally
occurring peptides from Toxoplasma gondii bound by HLA-A*02:01. These peptides
were extended at the C terminus (PΩ) and contained charged amino acids not more
than 3 residues after the anchor amino acid at PΩ, which enabled them to open the
F pocket and expose their C-terminal extension into the solvent. Here, we show
that the mechanism of F pocket opening is dictated by the charge of the first
charged amino acid found within the extension. Although positively charged amino 
acids result in the Tyr-84 swing, amino acids that are negatively charged induce 
a not previously described Lys-146 lift. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
peptides with alternative binding modes have properties that fit very poorly to
the conventional MHC class I pathway and suggest they are presented via
alternative means, potentially including cross-presentation via the MHC class II 
pathway.
