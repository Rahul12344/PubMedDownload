CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a non-redundant population critical for
the maintenance of self-tolerance. Over the past decade, the use of these cells
for therapeutic purposes in transplantation and autoimmune disease has emerged
based on their capacity to inhibit immune activation. Basic science discoveries
have led to identifying key receptors on Tregs that can regulate their
proliferation and function. Notably, the understanding that IL-2 signaling is
crucial for Treg homeostasis promoted the hypothesis that in vivo IL-2 treatment 
could provide a strategy to control the compartment. The use of low-dose IL-2 in 
vivo was shown to selectively expand Tregs versus other immune cells.
Interestingly, a number of other Treg cell surface proteins, including CD28,
CD45, IL-33R and TNFRSF members, have been identified which can also induce
activation and proliferation of this population. Pre-clinical studies have
exploited these observations to prevent and treat mice developing autoimmune
diseases and graft-versus-host disease post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation. These findings support the development of translational
strategies to expand Tregs in patients. Excitingly, the use of low-dose IL-2 for 
patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease and autoimmune disease has
demonstrated increased Treg levels together with beneficial outcomes. To date,
promising pre-clinical and clinical studies have directly targeted Tregs and
clearly established the ability to increase their levels and augment their
function in vivo Here we review the evolving field of in vivo Treg manipulation
and its application to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
