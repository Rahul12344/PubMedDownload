INTRODUCTION: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are strongly associated with tissue destruction
because of inflammation. In this study, we investigated the expression of MMPs
and TIMPs messenger RNA and protein levels in apical periodontitis lesions.
METHODS: Tissue samples from patients presenting clinical signs of chronic apical
abscess (CAA) or asymptomatic apical periodontitis (AAP) were collected
postoperatively and used for gene expression analysis of MMP-2, -3, -7, -9, -14, 
-16, and -25; TIMP-1; and TIMP-2 in real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Immunohistochemistry was also performed to detect the expression of MMP-7 and
TIMP-1 proteins. Lastly, U-937 cells were induced to terminal differentiation
into macrophages, infected with purified Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, and
assessed for the expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 using immunocytochemistry and
confocal microscopy.
RESULTS: Significantly higher messenger RNA levels were found for all genes in
AAP and CAA samples when compared with healthy control samples (P < .001). AAP
cases exhibited significantly higher TIMP-1 when compared with CAA cases, whereas
CAA cases showed higher MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9 messenger RNA levels (P < .05).
We also detected positive the expression of MMP-7 and TIMP-1 proteins in the
tissue samples. The expression of both MMP-7 and TIMP-1 were increased in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells compared with nonstimulated cells and appear 
to colocalize in the Golgi apparatus.
CONCLUSIONS: MMPs appear to have an influential role in CAA cases in which
ongoing tissue destruction is observed. TIMPs are preferentially associated with 
AAP, perhaps as a subsequent defense mechanism against excessive destruction.
Taken together, our findings implicate MMP and TIMP molecules in the dynamics of 
inflammatory periapical lesion development.
