[Presence of a prokaryote of the genus Haemobartonella Tyzzer and Weinman, 1939, 
in the blood of Nigerians in the Niamey region].

[Article in French]

Grétillat S, Konarzewski B.

The hemograms of 97 bed-riddens in very bad conditions reveal the presence (74
more or less infected but 6 heavily) of cocci, rots, rings, commas, coloured by
May-Grünwald and Giemsa stain against the cell membrane wall of the erythrocyts
and sometimes free in the blood plasma. This procaryotic element is the same
agent of the canine, feline, equine and cuniculine haemobartonellosis in Niger.
Principal symptoms are general weariness, anaemia, arthralgies, dizziness,
anguish, suffocation crisis. It is a disease of the deficient and underfed men in
Sahel.
