Despite ongoing (macro)pinocytosis of extracellular fluid, the volume of the
endocytic pathway remains unchanged. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we 
used high-resolution video imaging to analyze the fate of macropinosomes formed
by macrophages in vitro and in situ. Na+, the primary cationic osmolyte
internalized, exited endocytic vacuoles via two-pore channels, accompanied by
parallel efflux of Cl- and osmotically coupled water. The resulting shrinkage
caused crenation of the membrane, which fostered recruitment of curvature-sensing
proteins. These proteins stabilized tubules and promoted their elongation,
driving vacuolar remodeling, receptor recycling, and resolution of the
organelles. Failure to resolve internalized fluid impairs the tissue surveillance
activity of resident macrophages. Thus, osmotically driven increases in the
surface-to-volume ratio of endomembranes promote traffic between compartments and
help to ensure tissue homeostasis.
