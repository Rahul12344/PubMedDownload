Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells represent a specialized subset of innate 
lymphocytes that recognize lipid and glycolipid antigens presented to them by
nonclassical MHC-I CD1d molecules and are able to rapidly secrete copious amounts
of a variety of cytokines. iNKT cells possess the ability to modulate innate as
well as adaptive immune responses against various pathogens. Intracellular
bacteria are one of the most clinically significant human pathogens that
effectively evade the immune system and cause a myriad of diseases of public
health concern globally. Emerging evidence suggests that iNKT cells can confer
immunity to intracellular bacteria but also inflict pathology in certain cases.
We summarize the current knowledge on the contribution of iNKT cells in the host 
defense against intracellular bacterial infections, with a focus on the
underlying mechanisms by which these cells induce protective or pathogenic
reactions including the pathways of direct action (acting on infected cells) and 
indirect action (modulating dendritic, NK and T cells). The rational exploitation
of iNKT cells for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes awaits a profound
understanding of their functional biology.
