BACKGROUND: This study examined the new high-performance liquid chromatography
analyser HLC-723GX (GX) and investigated its ability to both measure glycosylated
haemoglobin (HbA1c) values and determine whether haemoglobin variants could cause
interference with these measurements in the Japanese population.
METHODS: For the basic GX examination, the within- and between-run precision,
linearity of measurements, correlation of HbA1c values with current systems and
the interference of chemically modified haemoglobin were determined. GX
interference caused by the haemoglobin variant was examined by analysing 39
clinical laboratory samples that contained haemoglobin variants.
RESULTS: Good within- and between-run precision were found, with the coefficients
of variation at ≤1.0%. A wide range of HbA1c measurement values were confirmed,
with the HbA1c values strongly correlated with the results of the currently used 
HLC-723G8 system. Chemically modified haemoglobins were prepared by adding
glucose, sodium cyanate, acetaldehyde or acetylsalicylic acid to normal blood
samples. None of these samples had any influence on the HbA1c values determined
by GX. GX analysis showed haemoglobin variants that eluted after HbA0 and were
similar to HbD, or HbS had HbA1c values that were close to those measured by
boronate affinity chromatography and immunoassay. GX found lower HbA1c values in 
blood that contained HbE or haemoglobin variants, which elute before or at nearly
the same time as HbA0.
CONCLUSIONS: GX is useful for the analysis of HbA1c samples that contain HbD,
HbS, HbC and haemoglobin variants, even though the elution times are similar.
However, a countermeasure is needed in order to avoid overlooking other
haemoglobin variants in Japan.
