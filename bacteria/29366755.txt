BACKGROUND: Chronic progression of diabetes is associated with decreased
pancreatic islet mass due to apoptosis of β-cells. Patients with diabetes have
increased circulating matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2); however, the
physiological significance has remained elusive. This study tested the hypothesis
that MMP2 inhibits cell apoptosis, including islet β-cells.
METHODS: Samples from diabetic patients and newly developed transgenic mice
overexpressing human MMP2 (hMMP2) were harnessed, and diabetes was induced with
streptozotocin.
RESULTS: Circulating hMMP2 was significantly increased in diabetic patients
compared to controls and significantly correlated with the serum C-peptide
levels. The diabetic hMMP2 transgenic mice showed significant improvements in
glycemia, glucose tolerance and insulin secretion compared to diabetic wild type 
mice. Importantly, the increased hMMP2 levels in mice correlated with significant
reduction in islet β-cell apoptosis compared to wild-type counterparts, and an
inhibitor of hMMP2 reversed this mitigating activity against diabetes. The
increased activation of Akt and BAD induced by hMMP2 in β-cells compared to
controls, links this signaling pathway to the anti-apoptotic activity of hMMP2, a
property that was reversible by both an hMMP2 inhibitor and antibody against
integrin-β3.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this study demonstrates that increased expression of hMMP2
may attenuate the severity of diabetes by protecting islet β-cells from apoptosis
through an integrin-mediated activation of the Akt/BAD pathway.
