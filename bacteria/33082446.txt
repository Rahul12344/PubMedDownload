Fatty acids are essential to most organisms and are made endogenously by the
fatty acid synthase (FAS). FAS is an attractive target for antibiotics and many
inhibitors are in clinical development. However, some gram-negative bacteria
harbor an enzyme known as the acyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase (AasS), which 
allows them to scavenge fatty acids from the environment and shuttle them into
FAS and ultimately lipids. The ability of AasS to recycle fatty acids may help
pathogenic gram-negative bacteria circumvent FAS inhibition. We therefore set out
to design and synthesize an inhibitor of AasS and test its effectiveness on an
AasS enzyme from Vibrio harveyi, the most well studied AasS to date, and from
Vibrio cholerae, a pathogenic model. The inhibitor C10-AMS
[5'-O-(N-decanylsulfamoyl)adenosine], which mimics the tightly bound acyl-AMP
reaction intermediate, was able to effectively inhibit AasS catalytic activity in
vitro. Additionally, C10-AMS stopped the ability of Vibrio cholerae to recycle
fatty acids from media and survive when its endogenous FAS was inhibited with
cerulenin. C10-AMS can be used to study fatty acid recycling in other bacteria as
more AasS enzymes continue to be annotated and provides a platform for potential 
antibiotic development.
