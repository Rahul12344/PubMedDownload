E Sakazakii is a cause of invasive infection with high death rates in neonates.
This report summarizes the investigation of infections associated with the
presence of the organism in commercial powdered formula fed to the infant. The
organism was detected in either prepared formula, the environment in wich it was 
prepared, or unopened products. Clinicians should be aware of the potential risk 
for infection from use of nonsterile formula in the neonatal health-care setting.
