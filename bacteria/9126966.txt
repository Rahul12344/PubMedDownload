T cell differentiation to effector cell function is required for the development 
of a type 2 immune response. The T cell surface molecule, CD28, is widely
considered to be the principal costimulatory molecule involved in T cell
differentiation to effector function, including IL-4 production, although this
has been difficult to directly examine in vivo. We have studied in vivo
differentiation to T cell effector function during two type 2 immune responses in
CD28 knockout mice: the systemic immune response to goat anti-mouse IgD Ab and
the mucosal immune response following oral inoculation with the nematode
parasite, Heligmosomoides polygyrus. Our results show that in C57BL/6 CD28
knockout mice elevations in IL-4 gene expression and protein secretion are
blocked during the immune response to goat anti-mouse IgD, and associated
increases in serum IgG1 and IgE are also inhibited to untreated control levels.
In marked contrast, T cell differentiation to IL-4 production is comparable in
C57BL/6 CD28 -/- and CD28 +/+ H. polygyrus-inoculated mice, and elevations in
both serum IgG1 and IgE levels occur. These results indicate that the specific
kind of type 2 immune response determines whether T cell differentiation to IL-4 
production is CD28 dependent.
