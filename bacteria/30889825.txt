Dysfunction of FcGRIIb, the only inhibitory receptor of the FcGR family, is
commonly found in the Asian population and is possibly responsible for the
extreme endotoxin exhaustion in lupus. Here, the mechanisms of prominent
endotoxin (LPS) tolerance in FcGRIIb-/- mice were explored on bone marrow-derived
macrophages using phosphoproteomic analysis. As such, LPS tolerance decreased
several phosphoproteins in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage, including protein kinase
C-β type II (PRKCB), which was associated with phagocytosis function.
Overexpression of PRKCB attenuated LPS tolerance in RAW264.7 cells, supporting
the role of this gene in LPS tolerance. In parallel, LPS tolerance in macrophages
and in mice was attenuated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)
administration. This treatment induced several protein kinase C families,
including PRKCB. However, PMA attenuated the severity of mice with cecal ligation
and puncture on LPS tolerance preconditioning in FcGRIIb-/- but not in wild-type 
cells. The significant reduction of PRKCB in the FcGRIIb-/- macrophage over
wild-type cell possibly induced the more severe LPS-exhaustion and increased the 
infection susceptibility in FcGRIIb-/- mice. PMA induced PRKCB, improved
LPS-tolerance, and attenuated sepsis severity, predominantly in FcGRIIb-/- mice. 
PRKCB enhancement might be a promising strategy to improve macrophage functions
in lupus patients with LPS-tolerance from chronic infection.
