Pelgipeptins are cyclic lipopeptides composed of nine amino acids and a short
fatty acid chain. In the present study, we report a novel pelgipeptin peptide
that was isolated from Paenibacillus elgii BC34-6 and named pelgipeptin E
(PGP-E). The molecular mass of PGP-E was 1072â€‰Da as determined by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and the amino acid sequence was elucidated by
tandem mass spectrometry. The complete molecular structure of PGP-E was
characterized using 2D NMR spectroscopy. PGP-E consisted of a cyclic peptide
backbone of Dab1-Val2-Dab3-Phe4-Leu5-Dab6-Val7-Leu8-Ser9 and a lipid chain
(-CH2CH2CH3). PGP-E had broad antimicrobial activity against gram-negative and
-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
strains. Furthermore, the mode of action of PGP-E was investigated using calcein 
dye leakage and membrane depolarization assays, which suggest that PGP-E acts via
a membrane-active mechanism. The hemolytic activity of PGP-E was significantly
lower than that of melittin, a well-known membrane-active peptide derived from
bee venom. These results suggest that PGP-E is a potential candidate in the
development of new peptide antibiotics.
