Saxitoxin, the most potent voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, is one of the
paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) produced by cyanobacteria and dinoflagellates. 
Recently, putative biosynthetic genes of PSTs were reported in these
microorganisms. We previously synthesized genetically predicted biosynthetic
intermediates, Int-A' and Int-C'2, and also Cyclic-C' which was not predicted
based on gene, and identified them all in the toxin-producing cyanobacterium
Anabaena circinalis (TA04) and the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (Axat-2).
This study examined the incorporation of (15)N-labeled intermediates into PSTs
(C1 and C2) in A. circinalis (TA04). Conversions from Int-A' to Int-C'2, from
Int-C'2 to Cyclic-C', and from Int-A' and Int-C'2 to C1 and C2 were indicated
using high resolution-LC/MS. However, Cyclic-C' was not converted to C1 and C2
and was detected primarily in the extracellular medium. These results suggest
that Int-A' and Int-C'2 are genuine precursors of PSTs, but Int-C'2 converts
partially to Cyclic-C' which is a shunt product excreted to outside the cells.
This paper provides the first direct demonstration of the biosynthetic route
towards saxitoxin and a shunt pathway.
