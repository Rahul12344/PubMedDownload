High-risk Stage III colon cancer patients identified by a novel five-gene
mutational signature are characterized by upregulation of IL-23A and gut
bacterial translocation of the tumor microenvironment.

The heterogeneities of colorectal cancer (CRC) lead to staging inadequately of
patients' prognosis. Here, we performed a prognostic analysis based on the tumor 
mutational profile and explored the characteristics of the high-risk tumors. We
sequenced 338 colorectal carcinomas as the training dataset, constructed a novel 
five-gene (SMAD4, MUC16, COL6A3, FLG and LRP1B) prognostic signature, and
validated it in an independent dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses confirmed that the five-gene signature
is an independent predictor of recurrence and prognosis in patients with Stage
III colon cancer. The mutant signature translated to an increased risk of death
(hazard ratio = 2.45, 95% confidence interval = 1.15-5.22, p = 0.016 in our
dataset; hazard ratio = 4.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.33-17.16, p = 0.008 in 
TCGA dataset). RNA and bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing of high-risk tumors
indicated that mutations of the five-gene signature may lead to intestinal
barrier integrity, translocation of gut bacteria and deregulation of immune
response and extracellular related genes. The high-risk tumors overexpressed
IL23A and IL1RN genes and enriched with cancer-related bacteria (Bacteroides
fragilis,Peptostreptococcus, Parvimonas, Alloprevotella and Gemella) compared to 
the low-risk tumors. The signature identified the high-risk group characterized
by gut bacterial translocation and upregulation of interleukins of the tumor
microenvironment, which was worth further researching.
