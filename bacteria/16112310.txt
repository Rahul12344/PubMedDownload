Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl
ethers (PBDEs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and analogues, hexachlorocyclohexanes
(HCHs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB), were measured in sediments and biota
(invertebrates, 11 fish species and cormorant tissues) collected in 2001 from the
Danube Delta, the biggest European wetland. DDTs were the predominant pollutants 
in all samples. A high variability in the concentrations of pollutants within the
same species was observed and this was related to sampling location, age, length 
and sex. DDTs were also the main organohalogenated contaminants in cormorant
muscle and liver, followed by PCBs, HCHs, HCB and PBDEs. The present levels of
DDTs in cormorant tissues are lower than levels measured in cormorant eggs
sampled from the Danube Delta in 1982 and 1997, respectively. The variance of
delta15N for herbivores was much greater than for carnivores, while carp and
bream showed higher delta15N signatures than expected, probably due to a higher
dietary proportion of benthos, typically more delta15N enriched relative to
pelagic biota.
