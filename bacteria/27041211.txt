BACKGROUND: Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is a rate limiting
enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP and pantetheine to dephosphocoenzyme
and pyrophosphate. The enzyme is allosteric in nature and regulated by Coenzyme A
(CoA) through feedback inhibition. So far, several structures have been solved to
decipher the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.
METHODS: To address catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of PPAT, structural
insights from single crystal X-ray diffraction method were primarily used,
followed by biophysical and biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: We have solved the structures of PPAT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with
its substrate analogue AMP-PNP and inhibitor CoA. For the first time, a
co-crystal structure of PPAT with Acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) was determined. Enzymatic
analysis was performed to decipher the catalytic, allosteric and inhibitory
mechanisms involved in regulation of PPAT. Binding affinities of PPAT with its
substrates and inhibitors were determined by SPR.
CONCLUSION: Previous studies from Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis indicated the 
inhibitory activity of AcCoA. PPAT-AcCoA structure along with some biochemical
methods established AcCoA as an inhibitor to PPAT and illustrated its inhibitory 
mechanism. Transition from catalytic to allosteric state involves formation of
ternary complex. We have studied the structural features of the ternary complex
of PPAT along with its product pyrophosphate and inhibitor CoA and validated it
with other biophysical and biochemical methods. Extensive analysis of all these
3D structures indicates that changes in side chains R90 and D94 are responsible
for transition between catalytic and allosteric inhibitory states.
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These enzymatic studies provide new insights into the
allosteric mechanism of PPAT.
