Brazil is the only country endemic for zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) that
regularly conducts epidemiologic and prophylactic control programs that involve
the treatment of human cases, insect vector control, and the removal of
seropositive infected dogs. This report reviews 60 studies reporting data on the 
efficacy of these recommended control tools and concludes that in Brazil 1)
eradication of the disease in Minas Gerais was achieved by the concomitant use of
the three control methods, 2) although seropositivity by an immunofluorescent
assay is not completely related to infectiousness, the removal of seropositive
dogs leads to a significant reduction of canine and human incidence, 3)
improvement of the sensitivity of the diagnostic tool used for canine control
should optimize the efficacy of control, and 4) although difficult and expensive,
the public health dog control campaigns performed in Brazil reduced the incidence
of ZVL and should be maintained since treatment of dogs is an unrealistic
intervention, both because of its prohibitive cost and relatively poor
effectiveness.
