Infection of mice with Listeria monocytogenes induces a strong CD8+ T cell
response, which is critical for the control of bacteria and for protection
against re-infection. We analyzed the CD8+ T cell response in different
intestinal tissues following oral and intravenous (i.v.) L. monocytogenes
infection. After oral infection, bacterial titers in small intestine and large
intestine, and the listeria-specific CD8+ T cell response in the mucosa of both
parts of the intestine, were highly correlated. Oral infection of CD28-deficient 
mice revealed that this response was strictly dependent on CD28 costimulation.
Significant listeria-specific CD8+ T cell responses also occurred in all
intestinal tissues analyzed after i.v. infection or after DNA vaccination,
indicating that the accumulation of listeria-specific CD8+ T cells in these
tissues only partially depends on local antigen presentation and inflammation.
