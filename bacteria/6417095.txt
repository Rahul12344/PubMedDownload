Isolation and partial characterization of a cerulenin-sensitive mutant of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Kawahara K, Uchida K, Aida K.

Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cerulenin was first tested. The result
indicated that this bacterium is resistant to cerulenin. Cerulenin-sensitive
mutants were isolated from P. aeruginosa PML 1552 by
1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine treatment and following carbenicillin plus
D-cycloserine screening. Isolated mutants were designated CSM-1 to CSM-19, and
some characters of CSM-19, which showed rapid growth almost as well as parent
strain in the medium without cerulenin, were examined. The cell growth of CSM-19 
was greatly inhibited by 50 micrograms/ml of cerulenin, but when the mixture of
cellular fatty acids or both cis-vaccenic acid and palmitic acid were added to
the medium, the growth was partially recovered. Incorporation of radioactivity
into fatty acids from [1-14C]acetate was lowered by cerulenin. Those results mean
that the fatty acid synthesis of CSM-19 was decreased by cerulenin. Although
cellular fatty acid composition and amount were not notably different between
CSM-19 and PML 1552, CSM-19 had less phosphatidylethanolamine, and more
phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin than PML 1552. CSM-19 was also
supersensitive to several other antibiotics, especially to carbenicillin and
tetracycline, when compared with PML 1552, although both strains showed identical
sensitivity to D-cycloserine, polymyxin B, and chloramphenicol.
