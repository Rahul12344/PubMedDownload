Treatments aimed at inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in patients with
sepsis have been unsuccessful. Up to 50% of such patients suffer from pneumonia. 
To determine the effect that treatment with anti-TNF has on pneumococcal
pneumonia, mice were intranasally inoculated with Streptococcus pneumoniae and,
25 h later, treated with 1 of the following: (1) control antibody, (2) anti-TNF, 
(3) ceftriaxone (CEF) with control antibody, or (4) CEF with anti-TNF. In the
absence of treatment with CEF, mice displayed high bacterial loads in lungs, and 
all of these mice died within 5 days after inoculation. Anti-TNF did not
influence these outcomes. In contrast, 60% of mice treated with CEF alone
survived. Anti-TNF administered together with CEF reduced survival to 40% and was
associated with enhanced bacterial outgrowth. These data suggest that treatment
with anti-TNF impairs the therapeutic efficacy of CEF during pneumococcal
pneumonia.
