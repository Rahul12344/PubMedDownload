We conducted a pilot study aimed at comparing the efficacy of the standard OAC
(omeprazole-amoxicillin-clarithromycin) regimen with a combination of the OAC
regimen and aspirin (OACA). Follow-up endoscopic findings showed that the
previous ulcers were completely healed in all subjects. The eradication rates
(per protocol) were 80.3% (49/61) in the OAC group and 86.7% (52/60) in the OACA 
group. The eradication rate was not significantly different between the two
groups. The most common adverse event was a bad taste, and the overall adverse
events were similar in the two groups. The combination of the OAC regimen and
aspirin was not significantly superior to the standard OAC regimen, but it was
well tolerated in a group of patients with peptic ulcer disease. Its potential
for clinical use to augment the efficacy of H. pylori eradication may warrant
further investigation.
