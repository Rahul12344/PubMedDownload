BACKGROUND:  Low levels of total C4b-binding protein (C4BPt), a circulating
inhibitor of the classical/lectin complement pathways, were observed in patients 
with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) and during warfarin treatment.
OBJECTIVES:  To investigate the associations between aPL and C4BPt in patients
with persistently positive (++) aPL, with/without clinical manifestations and
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and in controls. Furthermore, we explored the
impact of anticoagulation on C4BPt and in relation to complement activation.
METHODS:  In a cross-sectional design we investigated defined subgroups: primary 
(p) antiphospholipid syndrome (APS, N = 67), aPL++ individuals without clinical
manifestations (aPL carriers, N = 15), SLE-aPL++ (N = 118, among them, secondary 
[s] APS, N = 56), aPL negative (-) SLE (SLE-aPL-, N = 291), and 322 controls.
Clinical characteristics, including treatment, were tabulated. C4BPt was
determined with a magnetic bead method. Complement proteins (C1q, C2, C3, C4,
C3a, C3dg, sC5b-9, factor I [FI]) were measured. A mediation analysis was
performed to decompose the total effect of aPL++ on C4BPt into the direct and
indirect effects of aPL++ through warfarin.
RESULTS:  Overall, C4BPt is 20% decreased in aPL++ patients, regardless of SLE,
APS, clinical manifestations, and aPL profile. C4BPt levels associate positively 
with complement proteins C1q, C2, C3, and C4, and negatively with complement
activation product C3dg. In the SLE group, warfarin treatment contributes to
approximately half of the C4BPt reduction (9%) CONCLUSION:  Both aPLs and
warfarin are associated with C4BPt reduction. Complement activation in aPL++
patients may partly be explained by impaired inhibition through depressed C4BPt
levels. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implications.
