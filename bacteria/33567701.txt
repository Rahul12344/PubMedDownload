The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 24-week synbiotic
supplementation on chronic inflammation and the gut microbiota in obese patients 
with type 2 diabetes. We randomized 88 obese patients with type 2 diabetes to one
of two groups for 24 weeks: control or synbiotic (Lacticaseibacillus paracasei
strain Shirota (previously Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota) and
Bifidobacterium breve strain Yakult, and galactooligosaccharides). The primary
endpoint was the change in interleukin-6 from baseline to 24 weeks. Secondary
endpoints were evaluation of the gut microbiota in feces and blood, fecal organic
acids, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein,
and glycemic control. Synbiotic administration for 24 weeks did not significantly
affect changes in interleukin-6 from baseline to 24 weeks (0.35 ± 1.99 vs. -0.24 
± 1.75 pg/mL, respectively). Relative to baseline, however, at 24 weeks after
synbiotic administration there were positive changes in the counts of
Bifidobacterium and total lactobacilli, the relative abundances of
Bifidobacterium species such as Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Bifidobacterium 
pseudocatenulatum, and the concentrations of acetic and butyric acids in feces.
No significant changes in inflammatory markers were found in the synbiotic group 
compared to the control group. However, synbiotic administration at least
partially improved the gut environment in obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
