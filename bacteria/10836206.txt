Adhesion is required for cell growth, differentiation, survival, and function.
Cell adhesion is mediated by a structurally diverse group of plasma membrane
receptors, each exhibiting specialized ligand-binding properties that are needed 
for specific tasks. Integrin-mediated adhesion is important for hematopoietic
stem (HSC)/progenitor (HPC) cell survival and may prevent programmed cell death. 
Interleukin (IL)-11, a multi-functional cytokine secreted by the bone marrow
environment, plays an important role in regulating growth and differentiation of 
HSCs/HPCs. In this report, we demonstrate that IL-11 enhanced adhesion of freshly
isolated and 3 day-expanded CD34+ cells to immobilized fibronectin. the
expression of very late antigen (VLA)-4 and VLA-5 integrins was detected on CD34+
cells. CD34+ cells also expressed a-chain and gp130 subunits of the IL-11
receptor (R). Enhanced adhesion by IL-11 was mediated via activation of VLA-5
integrins, since this action could be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against
beta 1 and alpha 5, but not alpha 4, integrins. Addition of phosphatidylinositol 
(PI)-3 kinase inhibitors blocked IL-11 enhanced adhesion of CD34+ cells to
fibronectin. The results suggest that this enhanced adhesion is associated with
the PI-3 kinase pathway, an inside-out signaling pathway.
