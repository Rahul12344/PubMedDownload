Sulfate-dependent iron oxidation by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans: characterization
of a new EPR detectable electron transport component on the reducing side of
rusticyanin.

Fry IV, Lazaroff N, Packer L.

Iron(II) oxidation by pH 2.5 HCl-washed cells of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans is
known to be sulfate dependent. Sulfate dependence of the autooxidation of a novel
component in the electron transport pathway is demonstrated. This component
exhibits an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal in the oxidized state at
g = 2.005 distinguishable from the g = 2.08 signal attributed to rusticyanin. The
novel component is proposed to be a three-iron-sulfur cluster based upon the g
value, lineshape, and temperature dependence. Oxyanion specificity for the EPR
signal has the same dependence on sulfate as does iron(II) oxidation. By using
azide to inhibit electron transfer to oxygen, sulfate was shown to be involved in
electron transfer from the g = 2.005 component to the copper of rusticyanin.
