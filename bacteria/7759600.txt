The role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the shedding of soluble tumor necrosis
factor receptors in endotoxemia was investigated. The appearance of the soluble
tumor necrosis factor receptors was assessed in four healthy volunteers following
an intravenous injection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and in eight chimpanzees 
after intravenous administration of endotoxin in the absence or presence of
concurrent treatment with a neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha
monoclonal antibody. Injection of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in humans elicited 
a significant, instantaneous (after 15 min) increase in the plasma concentrations
of both types of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors. In chimpanzees,
treatment with the anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody completely
neutralized endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity. The release
of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors was strongly (80-90%) inhibited in the
presence of the neutralizing antibody. Our results indicate that tumor necrosis
factor-alpha is a prime mediator of endotoxin-induced release of its own soluble 
receptors.
