The only current curative treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is
allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Chimeric antigen receptor
treatment targeting CD19 for CLL achieved some complete responses, suggesting the
need for alternative or combinational therapies to achieve a more robust
response. In this work, we evaluated CAR-T cells specific for Siglec-6, an
antigen expressed in CLL, as a novel CAR-T cell treatment for CLL. We found that 
detection of SIGLEC6 mRNA and Siglec-6 protein is highly restricted to placenta
and immune cells in other tissues and it is not expressed in hematopoietic stem
cells. We generated CAR-T cells specific for Siglec-6 based on the sequence of
the fully human anti-Siglec-6 antibody (JML1), which was identified in a CLL
patient that was cured after allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(alloHSCT), and observed that it specifically targeted CLL cells in vitro and in 
a xenograft mouse model. Interestingly, a short hinge region increased the
activity of CAR-T cells to target cells expressing higher Siglec-6 levels but
similarly targeted CLL cells expressing lower Siglec-6 levels in vitro and in
vivo. Our results identify a novel CAR-T cell therapy for CLL and establish
Siglec-6 as a possible target for immunotherapy.
