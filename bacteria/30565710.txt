AIMS: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive tumour that is usually diagnosed 
at advanced stages and is characterised by a poor prognosis. Using public data of
normal human tissues, we found that mRNA and protein levels of mucin 5B (MUC5B)
and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) were highly increased in gallbladder tissues. In
addition, previous evidence has shown that claudin 18 (CLDN18) protein expression
is higher in GBC. The aim of this study was to perform an analysis of these cell 
surface proteins during the histological progression of GBC in order to identify 
their theranostic potential.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MUC5B expression, CA9 expression and CLDN18 expression were 
examined by immunohistochemistry in a series of 179 chronic cholecystitis
(including 16 metaplastic tissues), 15 dysplasia and 217 GBC samples by the use
of tissue microarray analysis. A composite staining score was calculated from
staining intensity and percentage of positive cells. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed high expression of MUC5B and CA9 among normal epithelium, metaplastic
tissues, and dysplastic tissues. However, expression of both proteins was
observed in roughly 50% of GBC samples. In contrast, CLDN18 was absent in normal 
epithelium, but its expression was higher in metaplastic cells. Among GBC cases, 
approximately half showed high CLDN18 expression. No associations were found
between MUC5B, CA9 and CLDN18 expression and any clinicopathological features.
CONCLUSIONS: CLDN18 is a new metaplasia marker in gallbladder tissues, and is
conserved in approximately half of GBC cases. MUC5B and CA9 are highly conserved 
during GBC histological progression. The three markers are potential theranostic 
markers, in particular CA9 and CLDN18, for which there are already targeted
therapies available.
