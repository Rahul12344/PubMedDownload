We generated transgenic mice for STAT-4, a regulatory protein specifically
associated with IL-12 signaling, under the control of a CMV promoter. These mice 
expressed strikingly increased nuclear STAT-4 levels in lamina propria CD4+ T
lymphocytes upon systemic administration of dinitrophenyl-keyhole limpet
hemocyanin and developed chronic transmural colitis characterized by infiltrates 
of mainly CD4+ T lymphocytes. The latter cells produced predominantly TNF and
IFN-gamma but not IL-4 upon activation with alphaCD3/CD28 or autologous bacterial
Ags, consistent with a Th1-type cell response. Furthermore, chronic colitis in
STAT-4 transgenic mice could be adoptively transferred to SCID mice by colonic
and splenic CD4+ T cells that were activated with Ags from autologous bacterial
flora. These data establish a critical molecular signaling pathway involving
STAT-4 for the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, and targeting of 
this pathway may be relevant for the treatment of colitis in humans.
