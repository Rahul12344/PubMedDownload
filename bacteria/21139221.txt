Nattokinase is a single polypeptide chain composed of 275 amino acids (molecular 
weight 27,724) which displays strong fibrinolytic activity. Moreover, it can
activate other fibrinolytic enzymes such as pro-urokinase and tissue plasminogen 
activator. In the present study, native nattokinase from Bacillus subtilis natto 
was purified using gel-filtration chromatography and crystallized to give
needle-like crystals which could be used for X-ray diffraction experiments. The
crystals belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=74.3, b=49.9,
c=56.3 Å, β=95.2°. Diffraction images were processed to a resolution of 1.74 Å
with an Rmerge of 5.2% (15.3% in the highest resolution shell) and a completeness
of 69.8% (30.0% in the highest resolution shell). This study reports the first
X-ray diffraction analysis of nattokinase.
