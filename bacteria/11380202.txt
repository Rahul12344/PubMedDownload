Initial degradation of highly chlorinated compounds and nitroaromatic compounds
found in munition waste streams is accelerated under anaerobic conditions
followed by aerobic treatment of the degradation products. The establishment of
anaerobic environment in a vadose zone can be accomplished by feeding appropriate
anaerobic gas mixture, i.e., "anaerobic bioventing". The gas mixture contains an 
electron donor for the reduction of these compounds. Lab scale study was
conducted to evaluate potential of anaerobic bioventing for the treatment of an
unsaturated zone contaminated with 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane 
(DDT) and 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT). Hydrogen was used as the electron donor.
Using the soil columns innoculate with anaerobic microorganisms, it was observed 
that by feeding a gas mixture of 1% hydrogen, 1% carbon dioxide and nitrogen,
methanogenic conditions were established and DDT was reductively dechlorinated.
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD) accumulated as the intermediate 
product. The half life of DDT was calculated to be 8.5 months. DNT completely
disappeared after six months of operation and no intermediates could be detected.
