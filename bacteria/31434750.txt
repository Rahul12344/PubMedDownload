Jorge Amich studies several aspects of sulfur and nitrogen metabolism in
Aspergillus fumigatus, with the ultimate aim of identifying targets for the
development of novel antifungals. In this mSphere of Influence article, he
reflects on how "Sub-Telomere Directed Gene Expression during Initiation of
Invasive Aspergillosis" (A. McDonagh, N. D. Fedorova, J. Crabtree, Y. Yu, S. Kim,
et al., PLoS Pathog 4:e1000154, 2008,
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000154) impacted his thinking about in vivo
metabolism and how to investigate it.
