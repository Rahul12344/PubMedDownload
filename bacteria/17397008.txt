Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide from
an infectious agent. Natural killer T (NKT) cells recognize mycobacterial
antigens and contribute to anti-MTB immunity in mouse models. NKT cells were
measured in subjects with pulmonary tuberculosis, MTB-exposed individuals, and
healthy controls. NKT cell levels are selectively lower in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis than in both
MTB-exposed subjects and healthy control subjects. This apparent loss of NKT
cells from the peripheral blood is sustained during the 6 months after the
initiation of MTB treatment. These findings indicate that NKT cells may be an
important component of antituberculosis immunity.
