Natural product peptide-based proteasome inhibitors show great potential as
anticancer drugs. Here we have cloned the biosynthetic gene cluster of a potent
proteasome inhibitor-glidobactin from Burkholderia DSM7029-and successfully
detected glidobactins/luminmycins in E. coli Nissle. We have also improved the
yield of glidobactin A tenfold by promoter change in a heterologous host. In
addition, two new biosynthetic intermediates were identified by comparative MS/MS
fragmentation analysis. Identification of acyclic luminmycin E implies substrate 
specificity of the TE domain for cyclization. The establishment of a heterologous
expression system for syrbactins provided the basis for the generation of new
syrbactins as proteasome inhibitors by molecular engineering, but the TE domain's
specificity cannot be ignored.
