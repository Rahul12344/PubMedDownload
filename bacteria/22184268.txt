Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune multifactorial degenerative disease with
detrimental affliction on central nervous system. MHC class I chain- related
geneA,B(MICA and MICB) are nonclassical human leukocyte antigens that can affect 
on some diseases and also on transplantation. The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the MICA and MICB MRNA expression in multiple sclerosis patients. In
this study, we evaluated MICA and MICB MRNA expression in the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells by reverse transcryptase-polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) in
MS patients and normal controls. The results of this study showed that 32.6% of
patients with progressive clinical outcome over expressed MICB genes in
comparison with controls ( p=0.002). It is concluded that the high expression of 
MICB gene in MS patients is an important criterion of MS disease that it may be
due to the interaction between MICB and its receptor on CD8+T or NK cells.
