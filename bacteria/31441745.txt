We describe the effects of the 7-valent (PCV7) and 13-valent (PCV13) pneumococcal
conjugate vaccines on pneumococcal meningitis in England and Wales during July 1,
2000-June 30, 2016. Overall, 84,473 laboratory-confirmed invasive pneumococcal
disease cases, including 4,160 (4.9%) cases with meningitis, occurred. PCV7
implementation in 2006 did not lower overall pneumococcal meningitis incidence
because of replacement with non-PCV7-type meningitis incidence. Replacement with 
PCV13 in 2010, however, led to a 48% reduction in pneumococcal meningitis
incidence by 2015-16. The overall case-fatality rate was 17.5%: 10.7% among
patients <5 years of age, 17.3% among patients 5-64 years of age, and 31.9% among
patients >65 years of age. Serotype 8 was associated with increased odds of death
(adjusted odds ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.7). In England and Wales, an effect on
pneumococcal meningitis was observed only after PCV13 implementation. Further
studies are needed to assess pneumococcal meningitis caused by the replacing
serotypes.
