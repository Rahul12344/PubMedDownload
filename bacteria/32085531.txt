Epigenetic reprogramming in macrophages is termed trained innate immunity, which 
regulates immune tolerance and limits tissue damage during infection. Neisseria
gonorrhoeae is a strict human pathogen that causes the sexually transmitted
infection termed gonorrhea. Here, we report that this pathogen harbors a gene
that encodes a histone deacetylase-like enzyme (Gc-HDAC) that shares high
3D-homology to human HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC8. A Gc-HDAC null mutant was
constructed to determine the biologic significance of this gene. The results
showed that WT gonococci reduced the expression of host defense peptides LL-37,
HBD-1 and SLPI in macrophages when compared to its Gc-HDAC-deficient isogenic
strain. The enrichment of epigenetic marks in histone tails control gene
expression and are known to change during bacterial infections. To investigate
whether gonococci exert epigenetic modifications on host chromatin, the
enrichment of acetylated lysine 9 in histone 3 (H3K9ac) was investigated using
the TLR-focused ChIP array system. The data showed that infection with WT
gonococci led to higher H3K9ac enrichment at the promoters of pro-inflammatory
mediators' genes, many TLRs, adaptor proteins and transcription factors,
suggesting gene activation when compared to infection with the Gc-HDAC-deficient 
mutant. Taken together, the data suggest that gonococci can exert epigenetic
modifications on host cells to modulate certain macrophage defense genes, leading
to a maladaptive state of trained immunity.
