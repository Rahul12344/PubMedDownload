Improved sequencing accuracy was obtained with 16S amplicons from environmental
samples and a known pure culture when upgraded Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)
hardware and enzymes were used for the single molecule, real-time (SMRT)
sequencing platform. The new PacBio RS II system with P4/C2 chemistry, when used 
with previously constructed libraries (Mosher et al., 2013) surpassed the
accuracy of Roche/454 pyrosequencing platform. With accurate read lengths of
>1400 base pairs, the PacBio system opens up the possibility of identifying
microorganisms to the species level in environmental samples.
