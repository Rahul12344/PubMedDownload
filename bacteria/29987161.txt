Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) catalyzes citrullination of histones, an
important step for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation. We aimed to
determine the role of PAD4 during pneumonia. Markers of NET formation were
measured in lavage fluid from airways of critically ill patients. NET formation
and host defense were studied during pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by
Klebsiella pneumoniae in PAD4+/+ and PAD4-/- mice. Patients with pneumosepsis,
compared with those with nonpulmonary disease, showed increased citrullinated
histone 3 (CitH3) levels in their airways and a trend toward elevated levels of
NET markers cell-free DNA and nucleosomes. During murine pneumosepsis, CitH3
levels were increased in the lungs of PAD4+/+ but not of PAD4-/- mice. Combined
light and electron microscopy showed NET-like structures surrounding Klebsiella
in areas of CitH3 staining in the lung; however, these were also seen in PAD4-/- 
mice with absent CitH3 lung staining. Moreover, cell-free DNA and nucleosome
levels were mostly similar in both groups. Moreover, Klebsiella and LPS could
still induce NETosis in PAD4-/- neutrophils. Both groups showed largely similar
bacterial growth, lung inflammation, and organ injury. In conclusion, these data 
argue against a major role for PAD4 in NET formation, host defense, or organ
injury during pneumonia-derived sepsis.
