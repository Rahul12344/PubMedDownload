Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells) are activated by lipid antigens
presented by CD1d, but the pathway leading to lipid antigen presentation remains 
incompletely characterized. Here we show a whole-genome siRNA screen to elucidate
the CD1d presentation pathway. A majority of gene knockdowns that diminish
antigen presentation reduced formation of glycolipid-CD1d complexes on the cell
surface, including members of the HOPS and ESCRT complexes, genes affecting
cytoskeletal rearrangement, and ABC family transporters. We validated the role in
vivo for the multidrug resistance protein 1 (Mrp1) in CD1d antigen presentation. 
Mrp1 deficiency reduces surface clustering of CD1d, which decreased iNKT cell
activation. Infected Mrp1 knockout mice show decreased iNKT cell responses to
antigens from Streptococcus pneumoniae and were associated with increased
mortality. Our results highlight the unique cellular events involved in lipid
antigen presentation and show how modification of this pathway can lead to lethal
infection.
