The dormant and resistant form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents a challenge
in developing new anti-tubercular drugs. Herein, we report the synthesis and
evaluation of trisubstituted thiazoles as antituberculosis agents. The SAR study 
has identified a requirement of hydrophobic substituent at C2, ester
functionality at C4, and various groups with hydrogen bond acceptor character at 
C5 of thiazole scaffold. This has led to the identification of 13h and 13p as
lead compounds. These compounds inhibited the dormant Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
H37Ra strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv selectively. Importantly, 13h and 13p were
non-toxic to CHO cells. The 13p showed activity against multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis isolates.
