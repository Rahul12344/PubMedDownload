Beclin 1, an autophagy and haploinsufficient tumor-suppressor protein, is
frequently monoallelically deleted in breast and ovarian cancers. However, the
precise mechanisms by which Beclin 1 inhibits tumor growth remain largely
unknown. To address this question, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen 
in MCF7 breast cancer cells to identify genes whose loss of function reverse
Beclin 1-dependent inhibition of cellular proliferation. Small guide RNAs
targeting CDH1 and CTNNA1, tumor-suppressor genes that encode cadherin/catenin
complex members E-cadherin and alpha-catenin, respectively, were highly enriched 
in the screen. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of CDH1 or CTNNA1 reversed Beclin
1-dependent suppression of breast cancer cell proliferation and
anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, deletion of CDH1 or CTNNA1 inhibited the 
tumor-suppressor effects of Beclin 1 in breast cancer xenografts. Enforced Beclin
1 expression in MCF7 cells and tumor xenografts increased cell surface
localization of E-cadherin and decreased expression of mesenchymal markers and
beta-catenin/Wnt target genes. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of
BECN1 and the autophagy class III phosphatidylinositol kinase complex 2
(PI3KC3-C2) gene, UVRAG, but not PI3KC3-C1-specific ATG14 or other autophagy
genes ATG13, ATG5, or ATG7, resulted in decreased E-cadherin plasma membrane and 
increased cytoplasmic E-cadherin localization. Taken together, these data reveal 
previously unrecognized cooperation between Beclin 1 and E-cadherin-mediated
tumor suppression in breast cancer cells.
