The tyrosine kinase Fyn has been implicated as playing an important role in the
generation of both stimulatory and inhibitory signaling events induced by TCR
engagement. To assess the role of Fyn for antigen-driven negative selection and
Treg development, which are both dependent on the strength and nature of TCR
signaling, we generated mice that co-express the transgenes for OVA and the OT-II
TCR, which recognizes a peptide from OVA. In mice expressing both transgenes,
negative selection, Treg development in the thymus, and the number of Treg in the
periphery were each unaffected by ablation of Fyn. Moreover, fyn(-/-) Treg were
functional, as assessed in vitro. We further tested the role of Fyn for the
adaptor function of c-Cbl, using mice containing a point mutation in c-Cbl that
abolishes its E3 ubiquitin ligase function but maintains its adaptor function.
The functional and signaling properties of this mutant c-Cbl were unaltered in
fyn(-/-) thymocytes. Combined, these data indicate that Fyn was not required for 
the induction of central tolerance by negative selection, the adaptor protein
role of c-Cbl, or the normal development and function of Treg.
