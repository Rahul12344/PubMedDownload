Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic infection of the oral mucosa 
caused by the commensal fungus Candida albicans IL-17R signaling is essential to 
prevent OPC in mice and humans, but the individual roles of its ligands, IL-17A, 
IL-17F, and IL-17AF, are less clear. A homozygous IL-17F deficiency in mice does 
not cause OPC susceptibility, whereas mice lacking IL-17A are moderately
susceptible. In humans, a rare heterozygous mutation in IL-17F (IL-17F.S65L) was 
identified that causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, suggesting the
existence of essential antifungal pathways mediated by IL-17F and/or IL-17AF. To 
investigate the role of IL-17F and IL-17AF in more detail, we exploited this
"experiment of nature" by creating a mouse line bearing the homologous mutation
in IL-17F (Ser65Leu) by CRISPR/Cas9. Unlike Il17f-/- mice that are resistant to
OPC, Il17fS65L/S65L mice showed increased oral fungal burdens similar to Il17a
-/- mice. In contrast to humans, however, disease was only evident in homozygous,
not heterozygous, mutant mice. The mutation was linked to modestly impaired CXC
chemokine expression and neutrophil recruitment to the infected tongue but not to
alterations in oral antimicrobial peptide expression. These findings suggest
mechanisms by which the enigmatic cytokine IL-17F contributes to host defense
against fungi. Moreover, because these mice do not phenocopy Il17f-/- mice, they 
may provide a valuable tool to interrogate IL-17F and IL-17AF function in vivo in
other settings.
