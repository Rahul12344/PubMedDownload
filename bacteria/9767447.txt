Ligation of CD28 molecules expressed on the surface of human leukaemic natural
killer-like YT cells triggers intracellular signals leading to cytolysis of
target cells expressing CD80 or CD86 molecules. Known intracellular events
include tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
and protein kinase C (PKC). In this study, we report that PKC-delta isoenzyme
activity is required for CD28-triggered cytotoxicity mediated by YT cells and we 
also demonstrate that one of the primary targets of bryostatin 1, a modulator of 
PKC activity, is PKC-delta. Treatment of YT cells with bryostatin 1 caused
degradation of PKC-delta, but not other PKC isoenzymes, and completely blocked
the cytolytic activity of YT cells. In addition, PKC-delta-specific antibody
introduced into YT cells by electroporation inhibited partially the YT
cell-mediated cytotoxicity of B-lymphoblastoid cell line JY. This effect was
specific, since addition of anti-PKC-delta antibody-blocking peptide in
combination with anti-PKC-delta antibody to YT cells for electroporation,
neutralized the effect of this antibody. These results demonstrate that YT cell
cytolytic activity is dependent on PKC-delta, which is selectively down-regulated
by bryostatin 1.
