Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is an antimicrobial peptide involved in host
defence against bacterial infection in epithelial tissues. Its levels are
dramatically increased after bacterial infection. The involvement of NF-kappaB in
Helicobacter pylori-mediated induction of hBD-2 promoter activity was examined. A
luciferase reporter plasmid containing the hBD-2 promoter extending from -2110
base pairs to -1 was transiently expressed in MKN45 cells, and promoter activity 
was determined after incubation with H. pylori for 6 h. Deletion or mutation of
the NF-kappaB site at -208 abolished activation of the hBD-2 promoter. Only H.
pylori strains carrying a cag pathogenicity island (PAI) induced activation of
the NF-kappaB site of the hBD-2 promoter gene. By gel retardation analyses, H.
pylori increased NF-kappaB binding to hBD-2 promoter gene sequences. Supershift
analysis demonstrated that whereas H. pylori activated NF-kappaB p65-p65 and
p50-p50 homodimers, and the p65-p50 heterodimer of NF-kappaB, only the p65-p65
homodimer bound to the NF-kappaB site of the hBD-2 promoter. Thus, specific
NF-kappaB proteins are important cis-elements for induction of hBD-2 gene
transcription by H. pylori.
