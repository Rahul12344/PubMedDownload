Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis are
characterized by an increase in hepatic triglyceride content with infiltration of
immune cells, which can cause steatohepatitis and hepatic insulin resistance. C-C
chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) is primarily expressed in immune cells, and CCR7
deficiency leads to the development of multi-organ autoimmunity, chronic renal
disease and autoimmune diabetes. Here, we investigated the effect of CCR7 on
hepatic steatosis in a mouse model and its underlying mechanism. Our results
demonstrated that body and liver weights were higher in the CCR7-/- mice than in 
the wild-type (WT) mice when they were fed a high-fat diet. Further, glucose
tolerance and insulin sensitivity were markedly diminished in CCR7-/- mice. The
number of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells was reduced in the livers of
the CCR7-/- mice. Moreover, liver inflammation was detected in obese CCR7-/-
mice, which was ameliorated by the adoptive transfer of hepatic mononuclear cells
from WT mice, but not through the transfer of hepatic mononuclear cells from
CD1d-/- or interleukin-10-deficient (IL-10-/-) mice. Overall, these results
suggest that CCR7+ mononuclear cells in the liver could regulate obesity-induced 
hepatic steatosis via induction of IL-10-expressing iNKT cells.
