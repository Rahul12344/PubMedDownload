The DEFB4 gene copy numbers were investigated in 206 AD patients and in 250
controls. The levels of the human defensin β-2 (hBD2) and α-defensins (HNP 1-3)
in the sera and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the patients and the controls
were determined. Higher copy numbers of the DEFB4 gene was observed in AD
patients as compared with the controls. The levels of hBD-2 and HNP 1-3 were
significantly elevated in the sera and in the CSF of the AD patients These data
suggest that both defensin β-2 and α-defensins have potential role in the
development of AD.
