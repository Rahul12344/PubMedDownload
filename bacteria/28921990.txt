The outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria is a complex and asymmetric
bilayer that antimicrobial peptides must disrupt in order to provoke the cell
lysis. The inner and external leaflets of the OM are mainly composed of
phospholipids (PL), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. Supported lipid
bilayers are interesting model systems to mimic the lipid asymmetric scaffold of 
the OM and determine the quantitative and mechanistic effect of antimicrobial
agents, using complementary physicochemical techniques. We report the formation
of asymmetric PL/LPS bilayers using the Langmuir-Blodgett/Langmuir-Schaefer
technique on two different surfaces (sapphire and mica) with synthetic
phospholipids constituting the inner leaflet and bacteria-extracted mutant LPS
making up the outer one. The combination of neutron reflectometry and atomic
force microscopy techniques allowed the examination of the asymmetric scaffold
structure along the normal to the interface and its surface morphology in buffer 
conditions. Our results allow discrimination of two structurally related
peptides, one neutral and inactive, and the other cationic and active. The active
cationic plasticin PTCDA1-KF disrupts the asymmetric OM at relevant
concentrations through a carpeting scenario characterized by a dramatic removal
of lipid molecules from the surface.
