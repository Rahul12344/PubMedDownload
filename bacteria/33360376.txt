Rapid immune responses regulated by invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells
bridge the gap between innate and adaptive responses to pathogens, while also
providing key regulation to maintain immune homeostasis. iNKT immune protection
and immune regulation are both mediated through interactions with innate and
adaptive B cell populations that express CD1d. Recent studies have expanded our
understanding of the position of iNKT cells at the fulcrum between regulating
inflammatory and autoreactive B cells. Environmental signals influence iNKT cells
to set the tone for subsequent adaptive responses, ranging from maintaining
homeostasis as an iNKT regulatory cell (iNKTreg) or supporting pathogen-specific 
effector B cells as an iNKT follicular helper (iNKTFH). Here we review recent
advances in iNKT and B cell cooperation during autoimmunity and sterile
inflammation. Understanding the nature of the interactions between iNKT and B
cells will enable the development of clinical interventions to strategically
target regulatory iNKT and B cell populations or inflammatory ones, across a
range of indications.
