BACKGROUND: Rising antibiotic resistance requires the evaluation of new and
effective therapies.
AIMS: To test the efficacy and safety of the new bismuth-containing quadruple
therapy in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Consecutive H. pylori-positive dyspeptic patients were
enrolled, either naïve or with previous failure treatment. Patients were treated 
with Pylera® (three-in-one capsules containing bismuth subcitrate potassium
140 mg, metronidazole 125 mg, and tetracycline 125 mg) three capsules q.i.d. plus
omeprazole 20 mg or esomeprazole 40 mg b.i.d. for 10 days. Eradication was
confirmed using an urea breath test (at least 30 days after the end of
treatment). Efficacy was assessed by UBT and safety by means of
treatment-emergent adverse events.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-one patients were included in the study: 42% of
patients were naïve, and 58%, with previous failure treatment. H. pylori
eradication was achieved in 124 patients (94.7%, 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
89.3-97.8) in ITT population. In the PP population, the percentage was 97.6%
(95%, CIs 93.3-99.2). No difference in eradication rate was found either between 
naïve and previously treated patients (92.7% vs 96.0%, P=.383), or smoking and
nonsmoking ones, or in patients taking omeprazole or esomeprazole.
Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 35 patients (26.7%, 95% CIs
19.9-34.9). They were mild in all cases except in four, who discontinued the
study due to diarrhea (three patients) and diffuse urticarial rush (one patient).
CONCLUSIONS: Pylera® achieved a remarkable eradication rate in clinical practice,
irrespective if it was used as first treatment or as a rescue therapy.
Treatment-emergent adverse events were uncommon generally mild.
