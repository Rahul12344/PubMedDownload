Purpose: Cancer metastasis can occur at the early stage of tumor development when
a primary tumor is at the microscopic size. In particular, the interaction of
malignant cells with other cell types including cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAF) in promoting metastasis at the early stage of tumor development remains
largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of CAFs in facilitating the
initial events of cancer metastasis when primary tumors were at microscopic
sizes.Experimental Design: Multicolor-coded cancer cells and CAFs were
coimplanted into the transparent zebrafish body and metastasis at a single-cell
level was monitored in living animals. Healthy fibroblasts, tumor factor-educated
fibroblasts, and CAFs isolated from various tumors were tested for their ability 
to facilitate metastasis.Results: We showed that CAFs promoted cancer cell
metastasis at the very early stage during primary tumor development. When a
primary tumor was at the microscopic size consisting of a few hundred cells, CAFs
were able to hijack cancer cells for dissemination from the primary site.
Surprisingly, a majority of metastatic cancer cells remained in tight association
with CAFs in the circulation. Furthermore, stimulation of
non-metastasis-promoting normal fibroblasts with TGF-B, FGF-2, HGF, and PDGF-BB
led to acquisition of their metastatic capacity.Conclusions: Cancer metastasis
occurs at the very early stage of tumor formation consisting of only a few
hundred cells. CAFs are the key cellular determinant for metastasis. Our findings
provide novel mechanistic insights on CAFs in promoting cancer metastasis and
targeting CAFs for cancer therapy should be aimed at the early stage during
cancer development. Clin Cancer Res; 23(16); 4769-79. ©2017 AACR.
