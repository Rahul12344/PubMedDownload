Optimal stimulation and prevention of anergy in T cells requires signaling
through the CD28 molecule. During HIV disease progression, CD28 expression is
lost, particularly on CD8+ T cells. Because alterations in cytokine production
patterns occur during HIV infection, we determined whether CD8+ T cell phenotype 
or function was affected by cytokine environment. Treatment of CD8+ T cells with 
IL-4 decreased levels of both CD28 surface expression and message and increased
CD8 expression. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had down-regulated CD28 had
reduced proliferative capacity. The inhibitory effects of CD28 reduction could be
compensated either by increased anti-CD3 or by exogenous IL-2, suggesting that
the strength of T cell signaling necessary for the production of IL-2 and
subsequent proliferation is negatively regulated by IL-4. CD8+ subpopulations
with differential CD28 expression produced different patterns of cytokines,
particularly IL-2 and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, CD8+ T cells that had reduced CD28 
levels but made their own IL-2 were able to proliferate in response to TCR
stimulation. These results suggest that loss of CD28 expression and CD8 T cell
function can be regulated by the cytokine environment, which may be altered
during HIV disease progression. Whether the dysfunction of CD8+ T cells in HIV
infection occurs by such a mechanism is the subject of future investigation.
