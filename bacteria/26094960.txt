OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of three rapid diagnostic tests
(RDTs) for typhoid fever in febrile hospitalised patients in Bangladesh.
METHODS: Febrile adults and children admitted to Chittagong Medical College
Hospital, Bangladesh, were investigated with Bact/Alert(®) blood cultures and
real-time PCR to detect Salmonella enterica Typhi and Paratyphi A and assays for 
Rickettsia, leptospirosis and dengue fever. Acute serum samples were examined
with the LifeAssay (LA) Test-it™ Typhoid IgM lateral flow assay detecting IgM
antibodies against S. Typhi O antigen, CTKBiotech Onsite Typhoid IgG/IgM Combo
Rapid-test cassette lateral flow assay detecting IgG and IgM antibodies against
S. Typhi O and H antigens and SD Bioline line assay for IgG and IgM antibodies
against S. Typhi proteins.
RESULTS: In 300 malaria smear-negative febrile patients [median (IQR) age of 13.5
(5-31) years], 34 (11.3%) had confirmed typhoid fever: 19 positive by blood
culture for S. Typhi (three blood PCR positive) and 15 blood culture negative but
PCR positive for S. Typhi in blood. The respective sensitivity and specificity of
the three RDTs in patients using a composite reference standard of blood culture 
and/or PCR-confirmed typhoid fever were 59% and 61% for LifeAssay, 59% and 74%
for the CTK IgM and/or IgG, and 24% and 96% for the SD Bioline RDT IgM and/or
IgG. The LifeAssay RDT had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 91% when
modified with a positive cut-off of ≥2+ and analysed using a Bayesian latent
class model.
CONCLUSIONS: These typhoid RDTs demonstrated moderate diagnostic accuracies, and 
better tests are needed.
