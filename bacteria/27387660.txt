Until now anaerobic oxidation of VFA at high salt-pH has been demonstrated only
at sulfate-reducing conditions. Here, we present results of a microbiological
investigation of anaerobic conversion of organic acids and alcohols at
methanogenic conditions by syntrophic associations enriched from hypersaline soda
lakes in Central Asia. Sediment incubation experiments showed active, albeit very
slow, methane formation from acetate, propionate, butyrate and C2 C4 alcohols at
pH 10 and various levels of salinity. Enrichments of syntrophic associations
using hydrogenotrophic members of the genus Methanocalculus from soda lakes as
partners resulted in several highly enriched cultures converting acetate,
propionate, butyrate, benzoate and EtOH to methane. Most syntrophs belonged to
Firmicutes, while the propionate-oxidizer formed a novel lineage within the
family Syntrophobacteraceae in the Deltaproteobacteria. The acetate-oxidizing
syntroph was identified as 'Ca. Syntrophonatronum acetioxidans' previously found 
to oxidize acetate at sulfate-reducing conditions up to salt-saturating
concentrations. Butyrate and a benzoate-degrading syntrophs represent novel
genus-level lineages in Syntrophomonadales which are proposed as Candidatus
taxons 'Syntrophobaca', 'Syntrophocurvum' and 'Syntropholuna'. Overall, despite
very slow growth, the results indicated the presence of a functionally competent 
syntrophic community in hypersaline soda lakes, capable of efficient oxidation of
fermentation products to methane at extremely haloalkaline conditions.
