Although there are multiple structures showing how alphabeta T cell receptors
(TCRs) specifically recognize antigenic peptides bound to the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (pMHC-I and pMHC-II), we have little
data on how TCRs interact with lipid-based antigens presented by members of the
CD1 family. Here, we review recent findings in the field of TCR recognition,
including TCR-pMHC complexes and the structure of a TCR in complex with
CD1d-glycolipid. Collectively, these studies have revealed the versatility of the
TCR in recognizing the distinct yet evolutionarily related proteinaceous and
lipid-presenting molecules of the immune system.
