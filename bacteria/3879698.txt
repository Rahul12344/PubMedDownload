Four cases of neonatal haemophilus influenzae have been reported in Intensive
Care Unite of Timone's Hospital (Marseille) during a 2 year period. Three of the 
cases were due to non typable organism, one was a type III. Hemoculture was
positive twice. None of the patients had meningitis. Clinically it was a neonatal
septicemia without particularity. Prognosis is bad (50% mortality). Several
hypothesis have been proposed to explain the increase of the frequency of this
neonatal infection. One of the major problem is the choice and the moment of
prescription of antibiotherapy.
