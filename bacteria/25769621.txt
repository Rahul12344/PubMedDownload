Because activating killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptors (KIRs) are
heterogeneously expressed in the population, we investigated the role of donor
activating KIRs in haploidentical hematopoietic transplants for acute leukemia.
Transplants were grouped according to presence vs absence of KIR-ligand
mismatches in the graft-vs-host direction (ie, of donor-vs-recipient natural
killer [NK]-cell alloreactivity). In the absence of donor-vs-recipient NK-cell
alloreactivity, donor activating KIRs had no effects on outcomes. In the 69
transplant pairs with donor-vs-recipient NK-cell alloreactivity, transplantation 
from donors with KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1 was associated with reduced risk of
nonrelapse mortality, largely infection related (KIR2DS1 present vs absent:
hazard ratio [HR], 0.25; P = .01; KIR3DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.18; P = .006),
and better event-free survival (KIR2DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.31; P = .011;
KIR3DS1 present vs absent: HR, 0.30; P = .008). Transplantation from donors with 
KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1 was also associated with a 50% reduction in infection rate
(P = .003). In vitro analyses showed that KIR2DS1 binding to its HLA-C2 ligand
upregulated inflammatory cytokine production by alloreactive NK cells in response
to infectious challenges. Because ∼40% of donors able to exert donor-vs-recipient
NK-cell alloreactivity carry KIR2DS1 and/or KIR3DS1, searching for them may
become a feasible, additional criterion in donor selection.
