In the gingival tissues of patients with periodontitis, inflammatory responses
are mediated by a wide variety of genes. In our previous screening study,
plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) mRNA binding protein expression
was increased in gingiva from periodontitis patients. In this study, we further
investigated the signaling pathway involved in PAI-1 expression induced by
Porphyromonas gingivalis LPS (Pg LPS) in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). When
HGFs were treated with Pg LPS, both PAI-1 mRNA expression and PAI-1 protein were 
induced in a dose-dependent manner. Pg LPS induced NF-κB activation and the
expressions of PAI-1 mRNA and protein were suppressed by pretreating with a NF-κB
inhibitor. Pg LPS also induced ERK, p38, and JNK activation, and Pg LPS-induced
PAI-1 expression was inhibited by ERK/p38/JNK inhibitor pretreatment. In
conclusion, Pg LPS induced PAI-1 expression through NF-κB and MAP kinases
activation in HGF.
