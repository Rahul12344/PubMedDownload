BACKGROUND: Aldosterone, synthesized in the adrenal cortex by the enzyme CYP11B2,
induces positive sodium balance and predisposes to hypertension. Various
investigators, using genomic DNA analyses, have linked -344T polymorphism in the 
human CYP11B2 (hCYP11B2) gene to human hypertension. hCYP11B2 gene promoter has 3
single-nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium: T/A at -663, T/C at
-470, and C/T at -344. Variants ACT occur together and form the haplotype-I
(Hap-I), whereas variants TTC constitute Hap-II. We hypothesize that these
single-nucleotide polymorphisms, when present together, will lead to
haplotype-dependent differences in the transcriptional regulation of the hCYP11B2
gene and affect blood pressure regulation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated differences in tissue expression in vivo and
consequential effects on blood pressure stemming from the 2 haplotypes. Novel
transgenic mice with the hCYP11B2 gene, targeted to the mouse HPRT locus, with
either Hap-II or Hap-I variant are used in this study. Our results show increased
adrenal and renal expression of hCYP11B2 in transgenic mice with Hap-I when
compared with mice with Hap-II. Importantly, we observed increased baseline blood
pressure in Hap-I transgenic mice, an effect accentuated by a high-salt diet.
Pathophysiological effects of elevated aldosterone were corroborated by our
results showing upregulation of proinflammatory markers in renal tissues from the
transgenic mice with Hap-I.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings characterize the haplotype-dependent regulation of
the hCYP11B2 gene where -344T serves as a reporter polymorphism and show that
Hap-I leads to increased expression of hCYP11B2, with permissive effects on blood
pressure and inflammatory milieu.
