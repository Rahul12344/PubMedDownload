Magnesium is currently under investigation as a prospective biodegradable implant
material. Biodegradation of magnesium causes a release of magnesium, hydroxide
ions and hydrogen gas but it can also lead to the formation of particulate
debris. Implant-derived particles may have immunotoxic effects. To investigate
the influence of magnesium-derived particles on the immune functions of primary
macrophages, up to 500 μg/ml magnesium or magnesium corrosion particles were
added to the cell culture medium. No major effects were observed on cell
viability and on the release of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis
factor (TNF)α. In addition, the ability of macrophages to stimulate proliferation
of allogenic lymphocytes in a mixed leukocyte reaction remained unaffected. When 
macrophages were incubated with magnesium particles and then infected with the
apathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis, infection-induced TNFα secretion from murine
macrophages was inhibited but not from human macrophages. However, the
bactericidal activity of either cell type was not influenced. In conclusion,
magnesium-related particles did not restrict the immune function of macrophages, 
suggesting that magnesium implants and corrosion particles derived thereof are
highly biocompatible and have a low inflammatory potential.
