Molecular-targeted drugs are generally effective against tumors containing driver
oncogenes, such as EGFR, ALK, and NTRK1. However, patients harboring these
oncogenes frequently experience a progression of brain metastases during
treatment. Here, we present an in vivo imaging model for brain tumors using human
cancer cell lines, including the EGFR-L858R/T790M-positive H1975 lung
adenocarcinoma cells, the NUGC4 hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-dependent gastric 
cancer cells, and the KM12SM colorectal cancer cells containing the TPM3-NTRK1
gene fusion. We investigated the efficacy of targeted drugs by comparison with
their effect in extracranial models. In vitro, H1975 cells were sensitive to the 
third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor osimertinib.
Moreover, HGF stimulated the proliferation of NUGC4 cells, that was inhibited by 
crizotinib, which has anti-MET activity. KM12SM cells were sensitive to the
tropomyosin-related kinase-A inhibitors crizotinib and entrectinib. In in vivo
H1975 cell models, osimertinib inhibited the progression of both brain and
subcutaneous tumors. Furthermore, in in vivo NUGC4 cell models, crizotinib
remarkably delayed the progression of brain tumors, and that of peritoneal
carcinomatosis. Interestingly, in in vivo KM12SM cell models, treatment with
crizotinib delayed the progression of liver metastases, but not that of brain
tumors. Conversely, treatment with entrectinib discernibly delayed the
progression of both tumor types. Thus, the effect of targeted drugs against brain
tumors can differ from the one reported in extracranial tumors. Moreover, the
same multikinase inhibitory drug can display different efficacies in brain tumor 
models containing different drivers. Therefore, our in vivo imaging model for
brain tumors may prove useful for preclinical drug screening against brain
metastases.
