The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 (KCNA3) is expressed by a subset of
chronically activated memory T cells and plays an important role in their
activation and proliferation. Here, we show that primary malignant T cells
isolated from patients with Sézary syndrome (SS) express Kv1.3 and are sensitive 
to potent Kv1.3 inhibitors ShK and Vm24, but not sensitive to a less potent
inhibitor [N17A/F32T]-AnTx. Kv1.3 blockade inhibits CD3/CD28-induced
proliferation and IL-9 expression by SS cells in a concentration-dependent
manner. In parallel, CD3/CD28-mediated CD25 induction is inhibited, whereas Kv1.3
blockade has no effect on apoptosis or cell death as judged by Annexin V and PI
staining. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that malignant T cells in 
SS express functional Kv1.3 channels and that Kv1.3 blockade inhibits
activation-induced proliferation as well as cytokine and cytokine receptor
expression in malignant T cells, suggesting that Kv1.3 is a potential target for 
therapy in SS.
