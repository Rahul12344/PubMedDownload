B cell antigen receptors are multicomponent complexes consisting of the surface
immunoglobulin and accessory molecules with associating protein-tyrosine kinases.
A spleen tyrosine kinase, Syk, in porcine B cells and a 72-kDa protein-tyrosine
kinase, PTK72, in murine B cells associate with the B cell antigen receptor.
Herein, we report the isolation of a full-length cDNA encoding the human
homologue of Syk. This cDNA predicted a polypeptide consisting of two
NH2-terminal SH2 domains and a COOH-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Syk is
highly conserved between human and swine and is homologous to the T
cell-associated protein-tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. Both Syk mRNA and protein were
detected in cells derived from multiple hematopoietic lineages. Within the B cell
compartment, Syk was expressed from pro-B cells to plasma cells. In vitro kinase 
assays conducted on the human Syk protein isolated from B cells revealed the
presence of autophosphorylation activity on Syk tyrosine residues. Tyrosine
phosphorylation of Syk associating with the B cell receptor complex in human was 
augmented rapidly after surface immunoglobulin cross-linking. The human SYK locus
was mapped to chromosome 9 at band q22.
