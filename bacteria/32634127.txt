Arrestin domain containing 3 (ARRDC3) represents a newly discovered Î±-arrestin
involved in obesity, inflammation, and cancer. Here, we demonstrate a
proinflammation role of ARRDC3 in Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis.
Increased ARRDC3 was detected in gastric mucosa of patients and mice infected
with H. pylori. ARRDC3 in gastric epithelial cells (GECs) was induced by H.
pylori, regulated by ERK and PI3K-AKT pathways in a cagA-dependent manner. Human 
gastric ARRDC3 correlated with the severity of gastritis, and mouse ARRDC3 from
non-BM-derived cells promoted gastric inflammation. This inflammation was
characterized by the CXCR2-dependent influx of CD45+CD11b+Ly6C-Ly6G+ neutrophils,
whose migration was induced via the ARRDC3-dependent production of CXCL2 by GECs.
Importantly, gastric inflammation was attenuated in Arrdc3-/- mice but increased 
in protease-activated receptor 1-/- (Par1-/-) mice. Mechanistically, ARRDC3 in
GECs directly interacted with PAR1 and negatively regulated PAR1 via
ARRDC3-mediated lysosomal degradation, which abrogated the suppression of CXCL2
production and following neutrophil chemotaxis by PAR1, thereby contributing to
the development of H. pylori-associated gastritis. This study identifies a
regulatory network involving H. pylori, GECs, ARRDC3, PAR1, and neutrophils,
which collectively exert a proinflammatory effect within the gastric
microenvironment. Efforts to inhibit this ARRDC3-dependent pathway may provide
valuable strategies in treating of H. pylori-associated gastritis.
