AIM: The relevance of prostate specific antigen (PSA)-prostate specific membrane 
antigen (PSMA) profiles in pathologic prostate (hyperplasia and cancer) has not
been fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of
PSA-PSMA profiles on sera PSA levels and angiogenic activity in benign prostate
hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma (PC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study has been carried out in 6 normal prostate (NP),
29 BPH and 33 PC with dominant Gleason grade>8. Immunohistochemical analysis has 
been performed. Monoclonal antibodies 3E6 and ER-PR8 have been used to assess
PSMA and PSA expression respectively. The evaluation of angiogenesis has been
made by CD34 immune marker. Serum levels of PSA have been assayed by Immulite
autoanalyser.
RESULTS: The study of each protein separately among sera PSA levels showed that
PSMA expression and angiogenic activity have the highest intensity in PC patients
with serum PSA levels>20 ng/mL. Nevertheless, the lowest tissue PSA expression
was found in PC patients with this latter sera PSA group. The most relevant
results showed that in PC patients (PSA+, PSMA+) and (PSA-, PSMA+) profile were
found to be inversely related to sera PSA levels. In PC patients, a high
immunoexpression of (PSA+, PSMA+) profile has detected in the sera PSA group>20
ng/mL; whereas a high immunoexpression of (PSA-, PSMA+) profile was detected in
the sera PSA group between 0 and 4 ng/mL. The highest angiogenic activity was
found in PC patients with (PSA+, PSMA+) profile.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings clearly have supported the feasibility of PSA-PSMA
profiles to improve in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in prostate
cancer patients.
