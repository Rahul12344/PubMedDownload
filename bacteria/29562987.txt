BACKGROUND: Excellent treatment outcomes have recently been reported for patients
with multi/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (M/XDR-TB) in settings where
optimal resources for individualised therapy are available.
OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether differences remain in treatment responses between
patients with M/XDR-TB and those with non-M/XDR-TB.
METHOD: Patients with TB were prospectively enrolled between March 2013 and March
2016 at five hospitals in Germany. Treatment was conducted following current
guidelines and individualised on the basis of drug susceptibility testing.
Two-month and 6-month sputum smear and sputum culture conversion rates were
assessed. A clinical and radiological score were used to assess response to
anti-tuberculosis treatment.
RESULTS: Non-M/XDR-TB (n = 29) and M/XDR-TB (n = 46) patients showed similar
rates of microbiological conversion: 2-month smear conversion rate, 90% vs. 78%; 
culture conversion rate, 67% vs. 61%; time to smear conversion, 19 days (IQR
10-32) vs. 31 days (IQR 14-56) (P = 0.066); time to culture conversion, 39 days
(IQR 17-67) vs. 39 days (IQR 6-85) (P = 0.191). Both clinical and radiological
scores decreased after the introduction of anti-tuberculosis treatment.
CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in scores between the two
groups until 6 months of treatment. Under optimal clinical conditions, with the
availability of novel diagnostics and a wide range of therapeutic options for
individualised treatment, patients with M/XDR-TB achieved 6-month culture
conversion rates that were compatible with those in patients with non-M/XDR-TB.
