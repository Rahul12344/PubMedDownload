RATIONALE: Recent studies showed that biological subphenotypes in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) provide prognostic enrichment and show
potential for predictive enrichment.
OBJECTIVES: To determine whether these subphenotypes and their prognostic- and
potential for predictive enrichment could be extended to other ICU patients,
irrespective of fulfilling the definition of ARDS.
METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of
adult patients admitted to the ICU. We tested the prognostic enrichment of both
cluster-derived and latent-class analysis (LCA)-derived biological ARDS
subphenotypes by evaluating the association with clinical outcome (ICU-, 30-day
mortality and ventilator-free days) using logistic regression and Cox regression 
analysis. We performed a principal component analysis to compare blood leukocyte 
gene expression profiles between subphenotypes and presence of ARDS.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We included 2499 mechanically ventilated patients 
(674 with and 1825 without ARDS). The cluster-derived "reactive" subphenotype
was, independently of ARDS, significantly associated with a higher probability of
ICU mortality, a higher 30-day mortality, and a lower probability of successful
extubation while alive compared to the "uninflamed" subphenotype. The blood
leukocyte gene expression profiles of individual subphenotypes were similar for
patients with and without ARDS. LCA-derived subphenotypes also showed similar
profiles.
CONCLUSION: The prognostic- and potential for predictive enrichment of biological
ARDS subphenotypes may be extended to mechanically ventilated critically ill
patients without ARDS. Using the concept of biological subphenotypes for
splitting cohorts of critically ill patients could add to improving future
precision-based trial strategies and lead to identifying treatable traits for all
critically ill.
