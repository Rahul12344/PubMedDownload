Solventogenic clostridia are well-known since almost a century due to their
unique capability to biosynthesize the solvents acetone and butanol. Based on
recently developed genetic engineering tools, a targeted 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase (Hbd)-negative mutant of Clostridium acetobutylicum was generated. 
Interestingly, the entire butyrate/butanol (C(4)) metabolic pathway of C.
acetobutylicum could be inactivated without a severe growth limitation and
indicated the general feasibility to manipulate the central fermentative
metabolism for product pattern alteration. Cell extracts of the mutant C.
acetobutylicum hbd::int(69) revealed clearly reduced thiolase, Hbd and crotonase 
but increased NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme activities as compared 
to the wildtype strain. Neither butyrate nor butanol were detected in cultures of
C. acetobutylicum hbd::int(69), and the formation of molecular hydrogen was
significantly reduced. Instead up to 16 and 20g/l ethanol were produced in
glucose and xylose batch cultures, respectively. Further sugar addition in
glucose fed-batch fermentations increased the ethanol production to a final titer
of 33g/l, resulting in an ethanol to glucose yield of 0.38g/g.
