We previously produced monoclonal antibodies against the detergent-insoluble
microdomain, i.e., the raft microdomain, of the human renal cancer cell line
ACHN. Raft.2, one of these monoclonal antibodies, recognizes sialosyl
globopentaosylceramide, which has the stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA)-4
epitope. Although the mouse embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell line F9 does not
express SSEA-4, some F9 cells stained with Raft.2. Western analysis and
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry
identified the Raft.2 binding molecule as laminin binding protein (LBP), i.e.,
34/67 laminin receptor. Weak acid treatment or digestion with Clostridium
perfringens sialidase reduced Raft.2 binding to LBP on nitrocellulose sheets and 
[(14)C]galactose was incorporated into LBP, indicating LBP to have a sialylated
carbohydrate moiety. Subcellular localization analysis by sucrose
density-gradient centrifugation and examination by confocal microscopy revealed
LBP to be localized on the outer surface of the plasma membrane. An
SSEA-4-positive human EC cell line, NCR-G3 cells, also expressed Raft.2-binding
LBP.
