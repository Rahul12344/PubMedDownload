The T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 complex, expressed on T cells, determines the
outcome of a T-cell response. It consists of the TCR-αβ heterodimer and the
non-covalently associated signalling dimers of CD3εγ, CD3εδ and CD3ζζ. TCR-αβ
binds specifically to a cognate peptide antigen bound to an MHC molecule, whereas
the CD3 subunits transmit the signal into the cytosol to activate signalling
events. Recruitment of proteins to specialized localizations is one mechanism to 
regulate activation and termination of signalling. In the last 25 years a large
number of signalling molecules recruited to the TCR-CD3 complex upon antigen
binding to TCR-αβ have been described. Here, we review knowledge about five of
those interaction partners: Lck, ZAP-70, Nck, WASP and Numb. Some of these
proteins have been targeted in the development of immunomodulatory drugs aiming
to treat patients with autoimmune diseases and organ transplants.
