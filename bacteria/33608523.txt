Mature red blood cells (RBCs) lack internal organelles and canonical defense
mechanisms, making them both a fascinating host cell, in general, and an
intriguing choice for the deadly malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), in 
particular. Pf, while growing inside its natural host, the human RBC, secretes
multipurpose extracellular vesicles (EVs), yet their influence on this essential 
host cell remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that Pf parasites, cultured in
fresh human donor blood, secrete within such EVs assembled and functional 20S
proteasome complexes (EV-20S). The EV-20S proteasomes modulate the mechanical
properties of naïve human RBCs by remodeling their cytoskeletal network.
Furthermore, we identify four degradation targets of the secreted 20S proteasome,
the phosphorylated cytoskeletal proteins β-adducin, ankyrin-1, dematin and
Epb4.1. Overall, our findings reveal a previously unknown 20S proteasome
secretion mechanism employed by the human malaria parasite, which primes RBCs for
parasite invasion by altering membrane stiffness, to facilitate malaria parasite 
growth.
