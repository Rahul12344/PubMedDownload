A discriminant based charge deconvolution analysis pipeline is proposed. The
molecular weight determination (MoWeD) charge deconvolution method was applied
directly to the discrimination rules obtained by the fuzzy rule-building expert
system (FuRES) pattern classifier. This approach was demonstrated with synthetic 
electrospray ionization-mass spectra. Identification of the tentative protein
biomarkers by bacterial cell extracts of Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium 
strains A1 and A19 by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) was also demonstrated. The data analysis time was
reduced by applying this approach. In addition, this method was less affected by 
noise and baseline drift.
