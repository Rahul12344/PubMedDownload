Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved intracellular process whereby cells break 
down long-lived proteins and organelles. Accumulating evidences suggest
increasing physiological significance of autophagy in pathogenesis of infectious 
diseases. Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) exerts its influence on numerous cells and
herein, we report a novel effect of LT-induced autophagy on mammalian cells.
Several autophagy biochemical markers including LC3-II conversion, increased
punctuate distribution of GFP-LC3 and development of acidic vesicular organelles 
(AVO) were detected in cells treated with LT. Analysis of individual LT component
revealed a moderate increase in LC3-II conversion for protective antigen-treated 
cells, whereas the LC3-II level in lethal factor-treated cells remained
unchanged. In addition, our preliminary findings suggest a protective role of
autophagy in LT intoxication as autophagy inhibition resulted in accelerated cell
death. This study presents a hitherto undescribed effect of LT-induced autophagy 
on cells and provides the groundwork for future studies on the implication of
autophagy in anthrax pathogenesis.
