INTRODUCTION: The degree of vascularity of the diseased mucosa in Oral Submucous 
Fibrosis (OSMF) has always been a matter of debate with conflicting results.
Knowledge of this aspect is important to understand pathogenesis of OSMF, which
in future could be translated into therapeutic strategies.
AIM: In the present study, attempt has been made to investigate parameters like
Mean Vascular Density (MVD), Total Vascular Area (TVA) and Mean Vascular Area
(MVA) using CD34 antibody.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty five previously untreated histopathologically
diagnosed cases of OSMF were retrieved from archives and fifteen age and sex
matched healthy volunteers without habits were included in the control group.
Sections were immunohistochemically stained for CD 34 and morphometric analysis
was performed. For statistical analysis ANOVA, Kruskal Wallis test and Mann
Whitney U tests were used and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
RESULTS: MVD was more in Stage I OSMF followed by Control, Stage II and Stage III
with statistically significant differences (p< 0.001). Statistically significant 
differences were observed in the MVD between control versus Stage III OSMF.
Similarly, TVA was statistically significant when compared between control versus
OSMF, control versus Stage II OSMF, control versus Stage III OSMF, Stage I versus
Stage II OSMF, Stage I versus Stage III OSMF, and Stage II versus Stage III OSMF.
For MVA, significant differences were between control versus OSMF, control versus
Stage II OSMF, control versus Stage III OSMF, Stage I versus Stage III OSMF and
Stage II versus Stage III OSMF.
CONCLUSION: Angiogenesis is seen in early stages of OSMF with decreasing trend in
advanced stages. Decreased vascular areas seen in advanced stages could be
attributed to the increasing fibrosis surrounding the blood vessels.
