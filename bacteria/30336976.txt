Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) form thioester bonds with ubiquitin (Ub),
which are subsequently transferred to target proteins for cellular progress.
Ube2K/E2-25K (a class II E2 enzyme) contains a C-terminal ubiquitin-associated
(UBA) domain that has been suggested to control ubiquitin recognition,
dimerization, or poly-ubiquitin chain formation. Ube2K is a special E2 because it
synthesizes K48-linked poly-ubiquitin chains without E3 ubiquitin ligase. We
found that a novel interaction between the acceptor di-Ub (Ub2) and the auxiliary
Ube2K promotes the discharging reaction and production of tri-Ub (Ub3), probably 
by guiding and positioning the K48 (in the distal Ub) of the acceptor Ub2 in the 
active site. We also determined the crystal structure of Ube2K-Ub2 at 2.47 Å
resolution. Based on our structural and biochemical data, we proposed a
structural model of Ub3 synthesis by Ube2K without E3.
