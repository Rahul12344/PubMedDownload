Previous expression/purification strategies for cytosolic phospholipase A2α
C2-domain in Escherichia coli have relied on refolded protein recovered from
inclusion bodies and sometimes containing C-terminal Cys139Ala and Cys141Ser
substitutions to eliminate potential refolding complications induced by Cys
residues. The protocol presented herein describes an effective method for the
expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2α C2-domain in soluble form in E. coli
and subsequent purification to homogeneity. This protocol, which utilizes a
cleavable 6xHis-SUMO tag, has recently been used to gain insights into the
structural basis of phosphatidylcholine recognition by the C2-domain of cytosolic
phospholipase A2α ( Hirano et al., 2019 ).
