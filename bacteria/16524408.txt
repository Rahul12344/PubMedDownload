In 2002, 119 isolates of the Enterobacter cloacae complex were collected randomly
from 11 German laboratories nationwide. Antibiotic susceptibilities were tested
by disk-diffusion tests according to CLSI guidelines, and MICs were determined
using Etests. PCRs were performed to amplify all TEM and SHV, and most CTX-M and 
OXA beta-lactamase genes. PCR products were sequenced to identify the precise
extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and
PM/PML Etests were used to confirm production of the respective ESBLs. According 
to susceptibility tests and CLSI criteria, 49 (40%) isolates were resistant to
extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Seven (5.8%) isolates were positive in at least
one of the PCR assays. Sequencing identified production of TEM-1 beta-lactamase
genes by three (2.9%) isolates, and ESBL genes of the CTX-M and SHV
beta-lactamase families by five (4.2%) isolates. IEF confirmed the production of 
beta-lactamases in the expected pI ranges of the respective ESBLs, and four of
the five ESBL-producers were detected using the PM/PML Etest. All ESBL-producing 
isolates showed co-resistance to sulphonamides.
