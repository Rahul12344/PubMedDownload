Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is the classic form of immune-mediated
infection-associated glomerulonephritis following a nonrenal infection. Its
epidemiology has been changing over the past several decades, with recent data
indicating a global decline, particularly in developed countries. This is owing
to better and earlier treatment of infections, and improvements in living
conditions and nutrition. The currently affected patient population tends to be
older, with more adults developing the disease, especially those with
comorbidities such as diabetes; approximately one-third of adults with PIGN will 
have at least one comorbid factor. Organisms causing PIGN are also changing, with
fewer cases associated with Streptococcus and more cases owing to Staphylococcus.
IgA-dominant PIGN has become more widely recognized as a lesion usually found in 
adult patients with diabetes or another form of chronic illness, with more severe
clinical manifestations and a more guarded outcome. Children have the best
prognosis and outcome followed by healthy adults, with adults having comorbid
factors exhibiting more chronic renal injury following PIGN. It is important to
be aware of these shifting features of PIGN, as the impacted patient population
is at higher risk for poor renal outcome.
