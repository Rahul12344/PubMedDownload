The polymyxin antibiotics [colistin and polymyxin B (PMB)] are increasingly used 
as a last-line option for the treatment of infections caused by extensively
drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Despite having similar structures and
antibacterial activity in vitro, the two clinically available polymyxins have
very different pharmacological properties, as colistin (polymyxin E) is
intravenously administered to patients in the form of an inactive prodrug
colistin methanesulphonate (sodium). This review will discuss recent progress in 
the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and toxicity of colistin and PMB, the
factors that affect their pharmacological profiles, and the challenges for the
effective use of both polymyxins. Strategies are proposed for optimising their
clinical utility based upon the recent pharmacological studies in vitro, in
animals and patients. In the 'Bad Bugs, No Drugs' era, polymyxins are a
critically important component of the antibiotic armamentarium against
difficult-to-treat Gram-negative 'superbugs'. Rational approaches to the use of
polymyxins must be pursued to increase their effectiveness and to minimise
resistance and toxicity.
