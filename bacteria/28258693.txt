The B7-CD28 family of ligands and receptors play important roles in T-cell
co-stimulation and co-inhibition. Phylogenetically they can be divided into three
groups. The recent discovery of the new molecules (B7-H3 [CD276], B7x
[B7-H4/B7S1], and HHLA2 [B7H7/B7-H5]/TMIGD2 [IGPR-1/CD28H]) of the group III has 
expanded therapeutic possibilities for the treatment of human diseases. In this
review, we describe the discovery, structure, and function of B7-H3, B7x, HHLA2, 
and TMIGD2 in immune regulation. We also discuss their roles in important
pathological states such as cancers, autoimmune diseases, transplantation, and
infection. Various immunotherapeutical approaches are emerging including
antagonistic monoclonal antibodies and agonistic fusion proteins to inhibit or
potentiate these molecules and pathways in cancers and autoimmune diseases.
