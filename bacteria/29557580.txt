Pulmonary infections are life-threatening complications in patients with spinal
cord injuries. In particular, paraplegic patients are at risk if they are
ventilator-dependent. This case history refers to a spinal cord injury with a
complete sensorimotor tetraplegia below C2 caused by a septic scattering of an
intraspinal empyema at C2-C5 and T3-T4. A right-sided purulent pneumonia led to a
complex lung infection with the formation of a pleuroparenchymal fistula. The
manuscript describes successful, considerate, non-surgical management with
shortterm separate lung ventilation. Treatment aimed to achieve the best possible
result without additional harm. A variety of surgical and conservative strategies
for the treatment of pleuroparenchymal fistula (PPF) have been described with
different degrees of success. We detail the non-surgical management of a
persistent PPF with temporary separate lung ventilation (SLV) via a double-lumen 
tube (DLT) in combination with talc pleurodesis as an approach in patients who
are unable to undergo surgical treatment.
