Mounting evidence indicates that oncogenic Ras can modulate cell autonomous
inflammatory cytokine production, although the underlying mechanism remains
unclear. Here we show that squamous cell carcinoma antigens 1 and 2 (SCCA1/2),
members of the Serpin family of serine/cysteine protease inhibitors, are
transcriptionally upregulated by oncogenic Ras via MAPK and the ETS family
transcription factor PEA3. Increased SCCA expression leads to inhibition of
protein turnover, unfolded protein response, activation of NF-ÎºB and is essential
for Ras-mediated cytokine production and tumour growth. Analysis of human
colorectal and pancreatic tumour samples reveals a positive correlation between
Ras mutation, enhanced SCCA expression and IL-6 expression. These results
indicate that SCCA is a Ras-responsive factor that plays an important role in
Ras-associated cytokine production and tumorigenesis.
