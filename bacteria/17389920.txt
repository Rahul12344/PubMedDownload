The anthrax toxin receptors, ANTXR1 and ANTXR2, act as molecular clamps to
prevent the protective antigen (PA) toxin subunit from forming pores until
exposure to low pH. PA forms pores at pH approximately 6.0 or below when it is
bound to ANTXR1, but only at pH approximately 5.0 or below when it is bound to
ANTXR2. Here, structure-based mutagenesis was used to identify non-conserved
ANTXR2 residues responsible for this striking 1.0 pH unit difference in pH
threshold. Residues conserved between ANTXR2 and ANTXR1 that influence the
ANTXR2-associated pH threshold of pore formation were also identified. All of
these residues contact either PA domain 2 or the neighboring edge of PA domain 4.
These results provide genetic evidence for receptor release of these regions of
PA as being necessary for the protein rearrangements that accompany anthrax toxin
pore formation.
