Genetic studies in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia have uncovered a
remarkable complexity of oncogenic and loss-of-function mutations. Amongst this
plethora of genetic changes, NOTCH1 activating mutations stand out as the most
frequently occurring genetic defect, identified in more than 50% of T-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemias, supporting a role as an essential driver for this gene
in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis. In this study, we aimed to
establish a comprehensive compendium of the long non-coding RNA transcriptome
under control of Notch signaling. For this purpose, we measured the
transcriptional response of all protein coding genes and long non-coding RNAs
upon pharmacological Notch inhibition in the human T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia cell line CUTLL1 using RNA-sequencing. Similar Notch dependent profiles 
were established for normal human CD34(+) thymic T-cell progenitors exposed to
Notch signaling activity in vivo. In addition, we generated long non-coding RNA
expression profiles (array data) from ex vivo isolated Notch active CD34(+) and
Notch inactive CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes and from a primary cohort of 15 T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with known NOTCH1 mutation status.
Integration of these expression datasets with publicly available Notch1
ChIP-sequencing data resulted in the identification of long non-coding RNAs
directly regulated by Notch activity in normal and malignant T cells. Given the
central role of Notch in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia oncogenesis, these
data pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target
hyperactive Notch signaling in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
