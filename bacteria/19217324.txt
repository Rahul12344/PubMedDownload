During evolutionary adaptation in the immune system, host defense is traded off
against autoreactivity. Signals through the costimulatory receptor CD28 enable T 
cells to respond specifically to pathogens, whereas those through the related
costimulatory receptor, ICOS, which arose by gene duplication, are critical for
affinity maturation and memory antibody responses. ICOS ligand, unlike the
pathogen-inducible CD28 ligands, is widely and constitutively expressed in the
immune system. Here, we show that crosstalk between these two pathways provides a
mechanism for obviating the normal T cell dependence on CD28. Several
CD28-mediated responses-generation of follicular helper T cells, germinal center 
formation, T helper 1 cell-dependent extrafollicular antibody responses to
Salmonella and bacterial clearance, and regulatory T cell homeostasis-became
independent of CD28 and dependent on ICOS when the E3 ubiquitin ligase Roquin was
mutated. Mechanisms to functionally compartmentalize ICOS and CD28 signals are
thus critical for two-signal control of normal immune reactions.
