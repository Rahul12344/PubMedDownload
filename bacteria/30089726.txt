BACKGROUND: Disruption of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) anion channel function causes cystic fibrosis (CF), and lung disease
produces most of the mortality. Loss of CFTR-mediated HCO3- secretion reduces the
pH of airway surface liquid (ASL) in vitro and in neonatal humans and pigs in
vivo. However, we previously found that, in older children and adults, ASL pH
does not differ between CF and non-CF. Here, we tested whether the pH of CF ASL
increases with time after birth. Finding that it did suggested that adaptations
by CF airways increase ASL pH. This conjecture predicted that increasing CFTR
activity in CF airways would further increase ASL pH and also that increasing
CFTR activity would correlate with increases in ASL pH.
METHODS: To test for longitudinal changes, we measured ASL pH in newborns and
then at 3-month intervals. We also studied people with CF (bearing G551D or R117H
mutations), in whom we could acutely stimulate CFTR activity with ivacaftor. To
gauge changes in CFTR activity, we measured changes in sweat Cl- concentration
immediately before and 48 hours after starting ivacaftor.
RESULTS: Compared with that in the newborn period, ASL pH increased by 6 months
of age. In people with CF bearing G551D or R117H mutations, ivacaftor did not
change the average ASL pH; however reductions in sweat Cl- concentration
correlated with elevations of ASL pH. Reductions in sweat Cl- concentration also 
correlated with improvements in pulmonary function.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CFTR-independent mechanisms increase ASL pH
in people with CF. We speculate that CF airway disease, which begins soon after
birth, is responsible for the adaptation.
