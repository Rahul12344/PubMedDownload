An epidemiological survey on 417 sample from ICU patients, was carried out from
January '97 to December 98 to verify the epidemiology of bacteria responsible for
nosocomial infections and to monitor the susceptibility patterns to antimicrobial
drugs during this period. Microbiological cultures were positive in 47.7% of the 
samples. P. aeruginosa was the most frequent pathogen, followed by Staphylococcus
aureus, Candida spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, E.coli, with a clear
prevalence of Gram-negative over Gram-positive isolates. The evaluation of the
antibiotic susceptibility profile of this bacterial pathogens suggests the
importance of a costant epidemiological surveillance in ICU.
