This release of the SRPDB (signal recognition particle database,
http://pegasus.uthct.edu/SRPDB/SRPDB . html ) adds four SRP RNA sequences (a
total of 99 SRP RNA sequences), 23 SRP protein sequences (a total of 63 protein
sequences from SRP9, SRP14, SRP19, SRP21, SRP54, SRP68 or SRP72), and, for the
first time, sequences of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic SRP receptor and its
homologous bacterial proteins (a total of 21 sequences). Sequences are offered
phylogenetically ordered, annotated with links to the primary databases, and in
aligned form. Also downloadable are sample SRP RNA secondary structure diagrams, 
three-dimensional models of representative SRP RNAs, and search motifs.
