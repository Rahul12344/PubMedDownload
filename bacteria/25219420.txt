Antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMP) are highly active molecules with a
broad-spectrum of microbicidal activity. Human beta-defensins (hBD)-2 and hBD-3
were initially isolated from psoriatic-scale extracts, and other AMP have been
identified in high concentrations in psoriatic skin explaining the uncommonness
of skin infections in these patients. When a 71-year-old male patient suffering
from a mild form of psoriasis (Psoriasis Area Severity Index PASI 4.4) presented 
a soft tissue infection (erysipelas) surrounding a psoriatic plaque of the elbow,
we asked whether a local deficiency of AMP could be the reason for this
infection. A detailed analysis of the expression and secretion levels of
different classes of AMP was conducted. Induction of AMP was clearly shown by
immunohistochemistry as well as by ELISA performed using skin-washing fluids.
Therefore, other factors, for example deep penetrating injuries bypassing the
keratinocyte innate defense system, must have caused the soft tissue infection.
