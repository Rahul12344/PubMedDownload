OBJECTIVES: Discrimination between infectious and noninfectious causes of acute
respiratory failure is difficult in patients admitted to the ICU after a period
of hospitalization. Using a novel biomarker test (SeptiCyte LAB), we aimed to
distinguish between infection and inflammation in this population.
DESIGN: Nested cohort study.
SETTING: Two tertiary mixed ICUs in the Netherlands.
PATIENTS: Hospitalized patients with acute respiratory failure requiring
mechanical ventilation upon ICU admission from 2011 to 2013. Patients having an
established infection diagnosis or an evidently noninfectious reason for
intubation were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood samples were collected upon ICU admission.
Test results were categorized into four probability bands (higher bands
indicating higher infection probability) and compared with the infection
plausibility as rated by post hoc assessment using strict definitions. Of 467
included patients, 373 (80%) were treated for a suspected infection at admission.
Infection plausibility was classified as ruled out, undetermined, or confirmed in
135 (29%), 135 (29%), and 197 (42%) patients, respectively. Test results
correlated with infection plausibility (Spearman's rho 0.332; p < 0.001). After
exclusion of undetermined cases, positive predictive values were 29%, 54%, and
76% for probability bands 2, 3, and 4, respectively, whereas the negative
predictive value for band 1 was 76%. Diagnostic discrimination of SeptiCyte LAB
and C-reactive protein was similar (p = 0.919).
CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU with clinical
uncertainty regarding the etiology of acute respiratory failure, the diagnostic
value of SeptiCyte LAB was limited.
