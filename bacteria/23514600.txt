Cyanobacterial aldehyde decarbonylase (cAD) is a non-heme diiron oxygenase that
catalyzes the conversion of fatty aldehydes to alkanes and formate. The mechanism
of this chemically unusual reaction is poorly understood. We have investigated
the mechanism of C1-C2 bond cleavage by cAD using a fatty aldehyde that
incorporates a cyclopropyl group, which can act as a radical clock. When reacted 
with cAD, the cyclopropyl aldehyde produces 1-octadecene as the rearranged
product, providing evidence for a radical mechanism for C-C bond scission. In an 
alternate pathway, the cyclopropyl aldehyde acts as a mechanism-based
irreversible inhibitor of cAD through covalent binding of the alkyl chain to the 
enzyme.
