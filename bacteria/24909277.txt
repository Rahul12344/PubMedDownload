OBJECTIVE: To construct an autophagy-targeted vaccine harboring the genes
encoding lipoprotein antigen precursor LpqH from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
microtubule-associated protein light chain-3(LC3), and to investigate its
efficacy of inducing and targeting autophagy.
METHODS: The expressions of LC-3 and LC3-LpqH in RAW264.7 cells were detected by 
Western blotting after transfected with pCMV-LpqH and pCMV-LC3-LpqH plasmids
respectively. The pCMV-LC3-LpqH or pCMV-LpqH plasmids were transfected into
GFP-LC3-RAW264.7 cells to analyze the localization of LC3-LpqH by
immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: After transfected with pCMV-LpqH DNA, RAW264.7 cells showed a
significant increase of LC-3 amount. The LC3-LpqH fusion protein was also
detected in RAW264.7 cells after pCMV-LC3-LpqH transfection and in a
dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, LpqH was found to be transported to
autophagosomes through the fusion protein, which was demonstrated by the
co-localization of GFP-LC3 and LC3-LpqH on autophagosomes.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant plasmid encoding pCMV-LC3-LpqH could enhance the
autophagy in vitro, and facilitate the localization of LpqH on autophagosomes.
Our study provides a new practical strategy for the development of improved
vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
