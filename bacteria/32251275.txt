Long-chain alk(a/e)nes represent the major constituents of conventional
transportation fuels. Biosynthesis of alkanes is ubiquitous in many kinds of
organisms. Cyanobacteria possess two enzymes, acyl-acyl carrier protein
(acyl-ACP) reductase (AAR) and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO), which
function in a two-step alkane biosynthesis pathway. These two enzymes act in
series and possibly form a complex that efficiently converts long chain fatty
acyl-ACP/fatty acyl-CoA into hydrocarbon. While the structure of ADO has been
previously described, structures of both AAR and AAR-ADO complex have not been
solved, preventing deeper understanding of this pathway. Here, we report a
ligand-free AAR structure, and three AAR-ADO complex structures in which AARs
bind various ligands. Our results reveal the binding pattern of AAR with its
substrate/cofactor, and suggest a potential aldehyde-transferring channel from
AAR to ADO. Based on our structural and biochemical data, we proposed a model for
the complete catalytic cycle of AAR.
