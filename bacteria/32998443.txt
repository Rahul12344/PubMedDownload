Fc-mediated effector functions of antibodies, including antibody-dependent
cytotoxicity (ADCC), have been shown to contribute to vaccine-induced protection 
from HIV-1 infection, especially those directed against non-neutralizing, CD4
inducible (CD4i) epitopes within the gp120 constant 1 and 2 regions (C1/C2 or
Cluster A epitopes). However, recent passive immunization studies have not been
able to definitively confirm roles for these antibodies in HIV-1 prevention
mostly due to the complications of cross-species Fc-FcR interactions and
suboptimal dosing strategies. Here, we use our stabilized gp120 Inner domain
(ID2) immunogen that displays the Cluster A epitopes within a minimal structural 
unit of HIV-1 Env to investigate an immunization protocol that induces a
fine-tuned antibody repertoire capable of an effective Fc-effector response. This
includes the generation of isotypes and the enhanced antibody specificity known
to be vital for maximal Fc-effector activities, while minimizing the induction of
isotypes know to be detrimental for these functions. Although our studies were
done in in BALB/c mice we conclude that when optimally titrated for the species
of interest, ID2 with GLA-SE adjuvant will elicit high titers of antibodies
targeting the Cluster A region with potent Fc-mediated effector functions, making
it a valuable immunogen candidate for testing an exclusive role of
non-neutralizing antibody response in HIV-1 protection in vaccine settings.
