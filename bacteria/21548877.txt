Thioridazine is a phenothiazine drug which has previously been extensively used
for its antipsychotic properties as it is associated with a low risk of
extra-pyramidal side-effects. There is good evidence to suggest that, in common
with other phenothiazine drugs, thioridazine has important anti-microbial
activity and is a potential candidate for development as an anti-microbial drug
against multi-resistant organisms, including drug-resistant strains of M.
tuberculosis. The clinical pharmacology and toxicity profile of thioridazine are 
reviewed in this article and the implications for future drug development along
with the patent are discussed.
