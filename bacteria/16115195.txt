The LBP-1 family consists of four proteins, which act as transcription factors in
the formation of dimers with a member of this family. LBP-1a and LBP-1b are
splicing variants from one gene, and LBP-1c and LBP-1d also arise from the
alternative splicing of another gene. Investigation of subcellular localization
of LBP-1 proteins fused to YFP revealed that the LBP-1b was localized in the
nucleus, whereas LBP-1a and LBP-1c were exclusively localized in the cytosol. The
peptide of 36 amino acids encoded by exon 6, a specific exon used only for
LBP-1b, possessed the function of a nuclear localization signal (NLS). Nuclear
localization of LBP-1a and LBP-1c occurred when LBP-1b was co-expressed,
suggesting that heterodimerization of LBP-1a and LBP-1c with LBP-1b is important 
for their nuclear transport. Transiently expressed LBP-1 proteins in COS-7 cells 
formed speckles in the nucleus. Most speckles overlapped with the PML body. The
activity of LBP-1a for accumulation in the PML body was mapped in the N-terminal 
region.
