β-Xylosidases (EC 3.2.1.37) catalyze the hydrolysis of short xylooligosaccharides
into xylose, which is an essential step in the complete depolymerization of
xylan, the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide of plant cell walls, and has great
biotechnological relevance for the production of lignocellulose-based biofuels
and the paper industry. In this study, a GH43 β-xylosidase identified from the
bacterium Bacillus licheniformis (BlXylA) was cloned into the the pET-28a
bacterial expression vector, recombinantly overexpressed in Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity by metal-affinity and size-exclusion 
chromatography. The protein was crystallized in the presence of the organic
solvent 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol and a single crystal diffracted to 2.49 Å
resolution. The X-ray diffraction data were indexed in the monoclinic space group
C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 152.82, b = 41.9, c = 71.79 Å, β = 91.7°.
Structural characterization of this enzyme will contribute to a better
understanding of the structural requirements for xylooligosaccharide specificity 
within the GH43 family.
