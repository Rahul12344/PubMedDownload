Cyclin E, the regulatory component of the cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 
complex, is required for proliferation and overexpression of this cyclin is
associated with many types of human tumors. To elucidate the mechanism by which
cyclin E overexpression promotes tumorigenesis, cyclin E was overexpressed in two
breast cancer lines: MCF7 and T47D. Cells overexpressing cyclin E display a
marked decrease in the expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, and
increased levels of the proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bax. The levels of Bcl-X(L)
and Mcl-1 remain unchanged. Since the homeostasis of pro- and antiapoptotic
proteins was altered, we asked if cyclin E overexpression modifies responses to
cytokines. MCF7 cyclin E overexpressing cells have an enhanced sensitivity to
Fas, TRAIL, and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis. T47D cells overexpressing cyclin E
have a significant increase in TNF-alpha and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In
conclusion, our results provide a link between expression of cyclin E,
deregulation of Bcl-2, and an altered response to cytokine-mediated apoptosis.
