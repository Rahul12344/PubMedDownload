PURPOSE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with 
marked disparities in prevalence and disease severity among different ethnic
groups. The purpose of this study is to characterize a Latin American cohort and 
identify genetic risk factors for developing SLE and its end-organ manifestations
in this Latin Hispanic cohort.
METHODS: A total of 201 SLE cases and 205 non-diseased controls were recruited in
the Dominican Republic (DR). Cases were defined according to the 1997 revised
American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of SLE. Genomic 
DNA was prepared from whole blood and applied to genotyping analyses for 42
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been implicated in autoimmune
diseases, including SLE, in other ethnic populations. Data were analyzed by
Fisher's Exact Probability Test.
RESULTS: In this cohort, SNP rs9271366 (tag SNP for HLA-DRB1*15:01) confers the
highest risk for SLE among the 13 MHC gene alleles that display association with 
SLE (p = 8.748E-10; OR = 3.5). Among the 26 non-MHC gene alleles analyzed, SNP
rs2476601 in PTPN22 gene confers the highest risk for SLE (p = 0.0001; OR = 5.6).
ITGAM, TNFSF4, TNIP1, STAT4, CARD11, BLK, and TNXB gene alleles were confirmed as
SLE-susceptible alleles in the DR cohort. However, IRF5 and TNFAIP3 gene alleles,
established risk factors for SLE in populations of European and Asian ancestry,
are not significantly associated with SLE in this cohort. We also defined a novel
HLA-DRA haplotype that confers an increased risk for lupus nephritis (LN) and
alleles in HLA-DRA2 and TNFSF4 genes as genetic risk factors for developing
neuropsychiatric (NP) SLE.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the Latin American population shares some
common genetic risk factors for SLE as other populations, but also has distinct
risk gene alleles that contribute to SLE susceptibility and development of LN and
NPSLE. This is the first study focusing on genetic risk factors for SLE in the
DR, a Latin American population that has never been characterized before.
