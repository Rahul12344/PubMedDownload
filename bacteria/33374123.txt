Within the German national monitoring of zoonotic agents, antimicrobial
resistance determination also targets carbapenemase-producing (CP) Escherichia
coli by selective isolation from food and livestock. In this monitoring in 2019, 
the CP E. coli 19-AB01133 was recovered from pork shoulder. The isolate was
assigned to the phylogenetic group B1 and exhibited the multi-locus sequence-type
ST5869. Molecular investigations, including whole genome sequencing, of
19-AB01133 revealed that the isolate carried the resistance genes blaVIM-1,
blaSHV-5 and blaCMY-13 on a self-transmissible IncA/C2 plasmid. The plasmid was
closely related to the previously described VIM-1-encoding plasmid S15FP06257_p
from E. coli of pork origin in Belgium. Our results indicate an occasional spread
of the blaVIM-1 gene in Enterobacteriaceae of the European pig population.
Moreover, the blaVIM-1 located on an IncA/C2 plasmid supports the presumption of 
a new, probably human source of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) 
entering the livestock and food chain sector.
