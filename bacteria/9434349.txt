PEX3 encodes at 52 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP), essential for
peroxisome biogenesis in the yeast Hansenula polymorpha. The relation between
Pex3p levels and peroxisome formation was studied in wild type (WT) and delta
pex3 strains expressing additional copies of PEX3 under control of a
substrate-inducible promoter, namely the strong alcohol oxidase (PAOX) or the
weaker amine oxidase (PAMO) promoter. In glucose-grown delta pex3 cells,
containing PAOX.PEX3, Pex3p was undetectable and peroxisomes were absent. After
induction of these cells on methanol, peroxisomes were rapidly formed. At Pex3p
levels up to 7-10 times the values observed in WT controls normal peroxisomes
were present. However, at further enhanced Pex3p levels a general matrix protein 
import defect was observed. This phenomenon was paralleled by aberrant peroxisome
assembly and the formation of numerous small vesicles. These vesicles contained
Pex3p, together with other H. polymorpha PMPs, but lacked the major matrix
proteins which has accumulated in the cytosol. The implications of our results on
PEX3 gene regulation and functioning of the peroxisomal matrix protein import
machinery in H. polymorpha are discussed.
