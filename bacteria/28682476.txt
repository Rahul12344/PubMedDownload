BACKGROUND: Circulating levels of growth factors involved in leucocyte production
and angiogenesis could be indicative of underlying aberrations of tissue
homeostasis and therefore be utilized as predictors of risk for all-cause
cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cancer mortality.
METHODS: Baseline plasma levels of a range of growth factors were measured in two
cohorts of the population-based FINRISK study (1997 Discovery cohort, N = 8444,
aged 25-74; 2002 Replication cohort, N = 2951, aged 51-74 years) using a
multiplexed bead array methodology and ELISA. Participants were followed up by
linking them to registry data.
RESULTS: In the Discovery cohort (653 deaths; 216 CVD-related, 231
cancer-related), fully adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models showed 
that increased plasma hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and placental growth factor 
(PlGF) were associated with higher risk of 10-year mortality (HR, 1.29 [95%
confidence interval (CI), 1.18-1.41] and HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.14-1.32],
respectively). In the Replication cohort (259 deaths; 83 CVD-related, 90
cancer-related), baseline HGF levels also predicted all-cause mortality (HR, 1.2 
[95% CI, 1.08-1.32]; PlGF data not available). By including HGF levels in a CVD
mortality model, 9% of all CVD deaths were correctly reclassified in the
Discovery cohort (categorical net reclassification improvement [NRI] for events, 
P = 4.0 × 10-4 ). Moreover, adding HGF to all-cause and CVD mortality models
resulted in an overall clinical NRI of 0.10-0.18 in the Discovery cohort and
meta-analyses (P < 0.05 for all tests).
CONCLUSION: Blood levels of HGF and PlGF may serve as new biomarkers for
predicting increased risk of death in the general population.
