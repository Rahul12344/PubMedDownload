Promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) nuclear bodies are present in most mammalian cell
nuclei. PML bodies are disrupted by PML retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) 
oncoproteins in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. These bodies contain numerous
proteins, including Sp100, SUMO-1, HAUSP(USP7), CBP and BLM, and they have been
implicated in aspects of transcriptional regulation or as nuclear storage depots.
Here, we show that three classes of PML nuclear bodies can be distinguished, on
the basis of their dynamic properties in living cells. One class of PML bodies is
particularly noteworthy in that it moves by a metabolic-energy-dependent
mechanism. This represents the first example of metabolic-energy-dependent
transport of a nuclear body within the mammalian cell nucleus.
