Infection with the common pathogen Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Cpn, previously
Chlamydia pneumoniae) has a high prevalence in patients suffering from
arteriosclerosis and may trigger or contribute to heart disease. In mice,
CD8-positive T cells are critical for the eradication of the infection and the
development of immune memory against Cpn. Although several H2-class I epitopes
have been described, no HLA-class I-associated peptides from Cpn are known. In
order to define HLA-A*0201 epitopes from Cpn, we focused on the bacterial heat
shock proteins (HSP) 60 and 70 which are known to be recognized by the immune
system. Using epitope prediction, peptide binding studies and peptide-specific
CTLs from HLA-A2 transgenic mice, we could define a potential HSP-70-derived
epitope. The study of PBMCs from Cpn-infected individuals using fluorescent MHC
tetramers revealed that some patients have CD8(+) T cells capable of recognizing 
the Cpn HSP-70 HLA-A*0201 epitope. Our studies pave the way to the
immunomonitoring of the anti-Cpn CTL immune response present in patients
suffering from different diseases potentially linked to Cpn or anti-Cpn immunity.
