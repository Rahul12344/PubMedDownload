Enzymes in the bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis pathway are important targets
for novel antibiotics. Of 750 temperature-sensitive (TS) mutants of Gram-positive
Staphylococcus aureus, six were complemented by the murC gene, which encodes the 
UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid:l-alanine ligase. Each mutation resulted in a single
amino acid substitution and, in all cases, the TS phenotype was suppressed by
high osmotic stress. In mutant strains with the G222E substitution, a decrease in
the viable cell number immediately after shift to the restrictive temperature was
observed. These results suggest that S. aureus MurC protein is essential for cell
growth. The MurC H343Y mutation is located in the putative alanine recognition
pocket. Consistent with this, allele-specific suppression was observed of the
H343Y mutation by multiple copies of the aapA gene, which encodes an alanine
transporter. The results suggest an in vivo role for the H343 residue of S.
aureus MurC protein in high-affinity binding to L-alanine.
