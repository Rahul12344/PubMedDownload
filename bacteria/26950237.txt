The acute phase of sepsis is characterized by a strong inflammatory reaction. At 
later stages in some patients, immunoparalysis may be encountered, which is
associated with a poor outcome. By transcriptional and metabolic profiling of
human patients with sepsis, we found that a shift from oxidative phosphorylation 
to aerobic glycolysis was an important component of initial activation of host
defense. Blocking metabolic pathways with metformin diminished cytokine
production and increased mortality in systemic fungal infection in mice. In
contrast, in leukocytes rendered tolerant by exposure to lipopolysaccharide or
after isolation from patients with sepsis and immunoparalysis, a generalized
metabolic defect at the level of both glycolysis and oxidative metabolism was
apparent, which was restored after recovery of the patients. Finally, the
immunometabolic defects in humans were partially restored by therapy with
recombinant interferon-Î³, which suggested that metabolic processes might
represent a therapeutic target in sepsis.
