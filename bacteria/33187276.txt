Metagenomics in agricultural research allows for searching for bioindicators of
soil health to characterize changes caused by management practices. Cover
cropping (CC) improves soil health by mitigating nutrient losses, yet the
benefits depend on the tillage system used. Field studies searching for indicator
taxa within these systems are scarce and narrow in their scope. Our goal was to
identify bioindicators of soil health from microbes that were responsive to CC
(three levels) and tillage (chisel tillage, no-till) treatments after five years 
under field conditions. We used rRNA gene-based analysis via Illumina HiSeq2500
technology with QIIME 2.0 processing to characterize the microbial communities.
Our results indicated that CC and tillage differentially changed the relative
abundances (RAs) of the copiotrophic and oligotrophic guilds. Corn-soybean
rotations with legume-grass CC increased the RA of copiotrophic decomposers more 
than rotations with grass CC, whereas rotations with only bare fallows favored
stress-tolerant oligotrophs, including nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Unlike
bacteria, fewer indicator fungi and archaea were detected; fungi were poorly
identified, and their responses were inconsistent, while the archaea RA increased
under bare fallow treatments. This is primary information that allows for
understanding the potential for managing the soil community compositions using
cover crops to reduce nutrient losses to the environment.
