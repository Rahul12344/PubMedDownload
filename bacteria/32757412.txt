Porocarcinoma is a rare malignant adnexal tumor with predilection for the lower
extremities and the head and neck region of older adults. This entity may arise
de novo or in association with a benign poroma. Porocarcinoma's non-specific
clinical appearance, immunohistochemical profile, and divergent differentiation
may occasionally be diagnostically challenging. Recently, highly recurrent YAP1
and NUTM1 gene rearrangements have been described in cases of poroma and
porocarcinoma. In this report, we present a case of porocarcinoma with squamous
differentiation in an 81-year-old woman which harbored rearrangement of the YAP1 
and NUTM1 loci and was diffusely immunoreactive for NUTM1. We discuss the recent 
advancements in the pathogenesis of poromas and porocarcinomas with emphasis on
the clinical utility of the NUTM1 antibody.
