Natural killer T (NKT) cells have gained great attention owing to their critical 
functional roles in immunity to various pathogens. In this review, we provide an 
overview of the current knowledge on the role of NKT cells in host defense
against and pathogenesis due to Chlamydia, which is an intracellular bacterial
pathogen that poses a threat to the public health worldwide. Accumulating
evidence has demonstrated that NKT cells, particularly invariant NKT (iNKT)
cells, play a crucial role in host defense against chlamydial infections,
especially in C. pneumoniae infection. iNKT cells can promote type-1 protective
responses to C. pneumoniae by inducing enhanced production of IL-12 by dendritic 
cells (DCs), in particular CD8α+ DCs, which promote the differentiation of naive 
T cells into protective IFN-γ-producing Th1/Tc1 type CD4+/CD8+ T cells. This
iNKT-cell-mediated modulation of DC function is largely dependent upon CD40-CD40L
interaction, IFN-γ production, and cell-to-cell contact. In addition, iNKT cells 
modulate the function of natural killer cells. NKT cells may be also involved in 
the pathogenesis of some chlamydial diseases by inducing different patterns of
cytokine production. A better understanding of NKT-cell biology will enable us to
rationally design prophylactic and therapeutic tools to combat infectious
diseases.
