Following the severe malaria outbreak in the central highlands in Madagascar in
1986, a vector control program by use DDT pm 75 house-spraying has been
implemented to operate in areas located at altitudes between 1000 and 1500 m.
Early treatment with chloroquine has also been incorporated in the control
program. To detect areas at particular high risk for malaria outbreak the
Geographic Information System (GIS) has been applied and tested. The study has
shown that the system can be used in malaria surveillance in order to identify
areas in which an intense distribution of Anopheles funestus can be anticipated
and, hence, targeted in spraying campaigns. The system may also be used to
monitor changes in anti-malarial drug resistance, in addition, to control of
other vector-born diseases.
