DNA and sera from 130 cases of gastric cancer and 263 population-based controls
were analyzed to study the association of HLA class II DR-DQ alleles with
Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection and the risk for gastric cancer. Presence of
the DQA1*0102 allele was inversely and significantly associated with Hp
seropositivity (P = 2 x 10(-5)), which is an independent replication of previous 
findings. However, this inverse relationship with Hp did not correspond with a
reduced risk of gastric cancer. At the DRB1 locus, the *1601 allele was
significantly associated with an increased gastric cancer risk with an odds ratio
(95% confidence interval) of 8.7 (range, 2.7-28.0). The effect of *1601 was more 
pronounced among Hp-negative subjects, and the association was stronger with the 
diffuse, rather than with the intestinal, histological type of gastric cancer.
Because none of the HLA alleles were associated with both Hp infection and
gastric cancer, the HLA DR-DQ alleles are linked with gastric cancer risk through
other mechanisms than an increased susceptibility to Hp infection.
