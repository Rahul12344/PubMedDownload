Bloodstream infections (BSI) are a severe complication of antineoplastic
chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), especially in the
presence of antibiotic resistance (AR). A multinational, multicenter
retrospective study in patients aged â‰¤ 18 years, treated with chemotherapy or
HSCT from 2015 to 2017 was implemented to analyze AR among non-common skin
commensals BSI. Risk factors associated with AR, intensive care unit (ICU)
admission and mortality were analyzed by multilevel mixed effects or standard
logistic regressions. A total of 1291 BSIs with 1379 strains were reported in
1031 patients. Among Gram-negatives more than 20% were resistant to ceftazidime, 
cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam and ciprofloxacin while 9% was resistant to
meropenem. Methicillin-resistance was observed in 17% of S. aureus and vancomycin
resistance in 40% of E. faecium. Previous exposure to antibiotics, especially to 
carbapenems, was significantly associated with resistant Gram-negative BSI while 
previous colonization with methicillin-resistant S. aureus was associated with
BSI due to this pathogen. Hematological malignancies, neutropenia and
Gram-negatives resistant to >3 antibiotics were significantly associated with
higher risk of ICU admission. Underlying disease in relapse/progression, previous
exposure to antibiotics, and need of ICU admission were significantly associated 
with mortality. Center-level variation showed a greater impact on AR, while
patient-level variation had more effect on ICU admission and mortality. Previous 
exposure to antibiotics or colonization by resistant pathogens can be the cause
of AR BSI. Resistant Gram-negatives are significantly associated with ICU
admission and mortality, with a significant role for the treating center too. The
significant evidence of center-level variations on AR, ICU admission and
mortality, stress the need for careful local antibiotic stewardship and infection
control programs.
