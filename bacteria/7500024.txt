Presentation of exogenous protein antigens to T lymphocytes is based on the
intersection of two complex pathways: (a) synthesis, assembly, and transport of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-invariant chain complexes from
the endoplasmic reticulum to a specialized endosomal compartment, and (b)
endocytosis, denaturation, and proteolysis of antigens followed by loading of
antigenic peptides onto newly synthesized MHC class II molecules. It is believed 
that expression of MHC class II heterodimers, invariant chain and human leukocyte
antigen-DM is both necessary and sufficient to reconstitute a functional MHC
class II loading compartment in antigen-presenting cells. Expression of each of
these essential molecules is under the control of the MHC class II transactivator
CIITA. Unexpectedly, however, whereas interferon gamma stimulation does confer
effective antigen-processing function to nonprofessional antigen presenting
cells, such as melanoma cells, expression of the CIITA transactivator alone is
not sufficient. Activation of antigen-specific T cells thus requires additional
CIITA-independent factor(s), and such factor(s) can be induced by interferon
gamma.
