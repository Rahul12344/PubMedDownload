AIMS: The pathogenic potential of Arcobacter butzleri isolates was investigated
by detecting the presence of putative virulence genes and analysing the adhesive 
and invasive capabilities in cell cultures of human cell lines.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The presence of ten putative virulence genes in 52 A.
butzleri isolates was determined by PCR. The genes ciaB, mviN, pldA, tlyA, cj1349
and cadF were detected in all, whilst irgA (15%), iroE (60%), hecB (44%) and hecA
(13%) were detected only in few A. butzleri isolates. On HT-29 cells, four of six
isolates adhered to and three of them were able to invade, whilst all six
isolates adhered to and invaded Caco-2 cells with higher degrees. The genes ciaB,
cadF and cj1349 of all six isolates were sequenced, but no considerable changes
of the amino acids in putative functional domains were observed.
CONCLUSION: Selected A. butzleri isolates adhere to and invade HT-29 and Caco-2
cells, which emphasize their human pathogenic potential. The efficiency of
invasion depends on the eukaryotic cell line and individual bacterial strain
used. We could not show any functional correlation between the amino acid
sequence of CadF, CiaB or Cj1349 and the adhesive and invasive phenotype.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: We have shown that some A. butzleri strains
invade various cell lines. This underlines their pathogenic potential and hints
at their relevance in human disease.
