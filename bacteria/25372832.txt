S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH) catalyzes the reversible conversion of
S-adenosylhomocysteine into adenosine and homocysteine. The SAHH from Thermotoga 
maritima (TmSAHH) was expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein
was purified and crystallized. TmSAHH crystals belonging to space group C2, with 
unit-cell parameters a=106.3, b=112.0, c=164.9 Å, β=103.5°, were obtained by the 
sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and diffracted to 2.85 Å resolution. Initial
phase determination by molecular replacement clearly indicated that the crystal
contains one homotetramer per asymmetric unit. Further refinement of the crystal 
structure is in progress.
