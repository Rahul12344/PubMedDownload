Hematopoietic stem cells differentiate in the thymus to T cells along precisely
defined intermediates. This process is thymic epithelium dependent and involves
cytokines and cell-cell interactions between thymic stroma and T-cell precursors.
Here we report that highly purified human CD34++ fetal liver stem cells
differentiate to mature T cells, when seeded into isolated fetal thymic lobes of 
severe combined immunodeficient mice, and subsequently cultured in vitro. The
human stem cells differentiate sequentially into CD4+CD8-CD3-, CD4+CD8+CD3-,
CD4+CD8+CD3+, and finally, CD4+CD8-CD3+4 and CD4-CD8+CD3++ cells. Phenotypic
analysis for additional maturation markers showed that these CD4 and CD8
single-positive thymocytes are fully maturate cells. By immunochemistry, human
HLA-DR+ cells with a dendritic morphology could be detected. This novel chimeric 
human-mouse fetal thymus organ culture offers a tool to study human T-cell
ontogeny in vitro and is a rapid and reliable test method for T-cell precursor
activity of cultured or transfected human stem cells.
