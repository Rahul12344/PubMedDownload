Adults of Opisthorchis viverrini reside in the biliary system, inducing
inflammation of bile ducts and cholangitis, leading to hepatobiliary disease
(HBD) including cholangiocarcinoma. O. viverrini infection also has major
implications for the bacterial community in bile ducts and liver. To investigate 
this in chronic O. viverrini infection (â‰¥ 8 months p.i.), bacterial genomic DNA
from livers of hamsters and from worms was investigated using culture techniques,
PCR for Helicobacter spp. and high-throughput next-generation sequencing
targeting the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene. Of a
total of 855,046 DNA sequence reads, 417,953 were useable after filtering.
Metagenomic analyses assigned these to 93 operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
consisting of 80 OTUs of bacteria, including 6 phyla and 42 genera. In the
chronic O. viverrini-infected group, bacterial community composition and
diversity were significantly increased compared to controls. Sequences of
Fusobacterium spp. were the most common (13.81%), followed by Streptococcus
luteciae (10.76%), Escherichia coli (10.18%), and Bifidobacterium spp. (0.58%).
In addition, Helicobacter pylori (0.17% of sequences) was also identified in the 
liver of chronic O. viverrini infections, but not in normal liver. The presence
of H. pylori was confirmed by PCR and by use of an antibody against bacterial
antigen, supporting the metagenomics data. The identities of bacteria cultured
for enrichment suggested that chronic O. viverrini infection changes the liver
microbiome and promotes Helicobacter spp. growth. There may be synergy between O.
viverrini and the liver microbiome in enhancing immune response-mediated
hepatobiliary diseases.
