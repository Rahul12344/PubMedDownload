Murine anti-lymphocyte monoclonal antibodies fail to act as opsonins for
allogeneic human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear phagocytes.

Roberton DM, Georgiou GM, Ellis WM, Hosking CS.

Seven murine monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to antigenic determinants present on
human lymphocytes did not promote phagocytosis of allogeneic human lymphocytes by
human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PML). Similarly there was no
significant metabolic activation of PML as determined by incorporation of
radiolabelled iodide. The opsonic activity of MoAbs was not enhanced by addition 
of human or rabbit complement nor by the use of sheep anti-mouse IgG, rabbit
anti-mouse immunoglobulin or goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin as second antibody.
Whole serum from mice immunized with human lymphocytes did not act as an opsonin 
when tested with human PML. Hyperimmune mouse antiserum to Bordetella pertussis
antigen acted only weakly as an opsonin. Human PML may not have an in vivo role
in the removal of allogeneic lymphocytes treated with murine anti-lymphocyte
MoAbs.
