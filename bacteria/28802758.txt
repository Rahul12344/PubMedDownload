Few studies have evaluated the clinical impact of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
for Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections in resource-limited settings
that lack direct antimicrobial stewardship intervention. This retrospective
cohort study compared patients with standard microbiological identification
(n=343) to those with additional identification by (PCR) (n=130). Time to
initiation of optimal therapy was similar between groups but substantially
shorter in the PCR group for those infected with methicillin susceptible S.
aureus (median 40.0h vs. 28.3h, P=0.001). After controlling for confounding
factors including infectious diseases consultation, the PCR group had a shorter
time to initiation of optimal therapy by 9.7h (95% CI 4.3-15.0h). Clinical
outcomes were similar in the non-PCR and PCR groups. While time to initiation of 
optimal therapy was shorter in the PCR group, greater reductions may be realized 
through additional education, direct antimicrobial stewardship intervention, or
additional clinician notification.
