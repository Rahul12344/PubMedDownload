Elevated levels of moulds in homes may represent a risk for development of
allergies and respiratory diseases. Little is known about the levels of these
biogenic contaminants in homes in South-West Germany. This paper presents the
results of a study which was performed between November 1997 and May 1998 in the 
four Sentinel Health Departments in Baden-Württemberg (Stuttgart, Mannheim, Kehl 
and Aulendorf/Bad Waldsee). It included 377 households in which children of 10
years of age resided. Moulds were determined in indoor air, outdoor air,
household dust from floors and mattresses. Specific home characteristics were
assessed by questionnaire. The median value of the number of colony forming units
(CFU) in indoor air was 135 CFU/m3 (range 5-17,000) and in outdoor air 145 CFU/m3
(range 15-2,900). The median value of CFU/g dust, collected from the floors, was 
15,000 (range 0-700,000) and collected from mattresses was 28,000 (range
1,500-1,350,000). The data suggest that an indoor-outdoor difference exceeding
the value of 500 CFU/m3 indicates an elevated mould concentration in indoor air
compared to background. This value can be discussed as a temporary reference
value for South-West Germany in the winter season. However, a health assessment
can not be derived from this value.
