The gastrointestinal tract is constantly exposed to microorganisms, mainly a
large and complex population of bacteria resident in the colon and distal small
intestine. Although the normal host relationship with the resident luminal
bacteria is often mutually beneficial, the host also requires protection against 
these microorganisms. Epithelial cells play a critical role in mediating these
protective responses and there is increasing appreciation of the likely
importance of antimicrobial peptides of the defensin family that they express.
The enteric alpha-defensins (human defensins [HD]5 and 6) are expressed by Paneth
cells, which are normally confined to the small intestine, but are also seen in
the colon in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Studies have shown that
HD5 is stored in Paneth cell granules in precursor form and requires processing
to the mature peptide. Human beta-defensin (HBD)1 is constitutively expressed in 
intestinal epithelial cells, whereas the expression of HBD2 is induced in
inflammatory bowel disease. HBDs have also been shown to be chemotactic for
immature dendritic cells and memory T cells. Thus, they may not only mediate
innate immunity, but also regulate adaptive immune responses in inflammatory
bowel disease.
