Rothia dentocariosa is an indigenous microbial flora of dental plaque. To examine
the bacterium population in oral cavities, a novel selective medium, designated
RDSM, was developed for the isolation of R. dentocariosa. RDSM was prepared by
adding 0.5 μg/ml of lincomycin, 10 μg/ml of colistin, and 40% sucrose to Heart
Infusion (HI). Average growth recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM was 93.8% that 
of HI medium. Growth of other bacteria including Rothia mucilaginosa, Neisseria, 
Actinomyces, or streptococci was remarkably inhibited on the selective medium.
Clinical efficacy was evaluated by the recovery of R. dentocariosa on RDSM from
the stimulated saliva samples of 8 volunteers. R. dentocariosa was detected at
2.6 (range: 1.0-4.6) % to total bacteria of 8.0×10(7)CFU/ml on BHI in their oral 
cavities. The new selective medium, RDSM, was highly selective for R.
dentocariosa and was useful for the isolation of R. dentocariosa from clinical
samples.
