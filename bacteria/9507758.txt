During 1995, among 1105 HIV patients explored in our department, 64 presented a
deep fungic infection (5.8%). The yeast was searched for in cerebrospinal fluid, 
blood, urine, and bronchoalveolar aspiration. Isolated germs were Cryptococcus
neoformans (95%), Candida tropicalis (1 case), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1 case) 
et Aspergillus fumigatus (1 case). Results of treatment with amphotericin B were:
recovery (9%), clinical success (11%), out of sight (14%), letality (66%),
relapse (23%) and side effects (19%). We emphasized diagnostical and
therapeutical difficulties, and bad prognostic of mycoses in patients with AIDS.
