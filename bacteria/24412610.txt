Comment in
    Immunity. 2014 Jan 16;40(1):5-7.

Many hematopoietic cell types express CD1d and are capable of presenting
glycolipid antigens to invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT cells). However,
the question of which cells are the principal presenters of glycolipid antigens
in vivo remains controversial, and it has been suggested that this might vary
depending on the structure of a particular glycolipid antigen. Here we have shown
that a single type of cell, the CD8α(+) DEC-205(+) dendritic cell, was mainly
responsible for capturing and presenting a variety of different glycolipid
antigens, including multiple forms of α-galactosylceramide that stimulate widely 
divergent cytokine responses. After glycolipid presentation, these dendritic
cells rapidly altered their expression of various costimulatory and coinhibitory 
molecules in a manner that was dependent on the structure of the antigen. These
findings show flexibility in the outcome of two-way communication between CD8α(+)
dendritic cells and iNKT cells, providing a mechanism for biasing toward either
proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses.
