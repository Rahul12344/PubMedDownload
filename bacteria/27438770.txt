Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to sites of inflammation and
infection. However, patients with allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis
show a paucity of skin neutrophils and are prone to bacterial skin infections,
suggesting that allergic inflammation curtails neutrophil responses. Here we have
shown that the type 2 cell signature cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) hampers
neutrophil expansion and migration by antagonizing granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) and chemokine receptor-mediated signals. Cutaneous bacterial
infection in mice was exacerbated by IL-4 signaling and improved with IL-4
inhibition, each outcome inversely correlating with neutrophil migration to skin.
Likewise, systemic bacterial infection was worsened by heightened IL-4 activity, 
with IL-4 restricting G-CSF-induced neutrophil expansion and migration to tissues
by affecting CXCR2-CXCR4 chemokine signaling in neutrophils. These effects were
dependent on IL-4 acting through type 2 IL-4 receptors on neutrophils. Thus,
targeting IL-4 might be beneficial in neutropenic conditions with increased
susceptibility to bacterial infections.
