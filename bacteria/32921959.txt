BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are suggested to
increase the risk of gastric cancer (GC).
AIM: To investigate the HLA allele frequencies of patients with GC relative to a 
control group in terms of CagA+ multiple (≥ 2) EPIYA-C repeats.
METHODS: The patient group comprised 94 patients [44 GC and 50 duodenal ulcer
(DU) patients], and the control group comprised 86 individuals [(50 non-ulcer
dyspepsia patients and 36 people with asymptomatic Helicobacter pylori (H.
pylori)]. Polymerase chain reaction was performed for the amplification of the H.
pylori cagA gene and typing of EPIYA motifs. HLA sequence-specific
oligonucleotide (SSO) typing was performed using Lifecodes SSO typing kits
(HLA-A, HLA-B HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQA1-B1 kits).
RESULTS: The comparison of GC cases in terms of CagA+ multiple (≥ 2) EPIYA-C
repeats showed that only the HLA-DQB1*06 allele [odds ratio (OR): 0.37, P =
0.036] was significantly lower, but significance was lost after correction (Pc = 
0.1845). The HLA-DQA1*01 allele had a high ratio in GC cases with multiple
EPIYA-C repeats, but this was not significant in the univariate analysis. We
compared allele frequencies in the DU cases alone and in GC and DU cases together
using the same criterion, and none of the HLA alleles were significantly
associated with GC or DU. Also, none of the alleles were detected as independent 
risk factors after the multivariate analysis. On the other hand, in a
multivariate logistic regression with no discriminative criterion, HLA-DQA1*01
(OR = 1.848), HLA-DQB1*06 (OR = 1.821) and HLA-A*02 (OR = 1.579) alleles were
detected as independent risk factors for GC and DU.
CONCLUSION: None of the HLA alleles were detected as independent risk factors in 
terms of CagA+ multiple EPIYA-C repeats. However, HLA-DQA1*01, HLA-DQB1*0601, and
HLA-A*2 were independent risk factors with no criterion in the multivariate
analysis. We suggest that the association of these alleles with gastric
malignancies is not specifically related to cagA and multiple EPIYA C repeats.
