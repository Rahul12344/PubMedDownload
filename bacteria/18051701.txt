BACKGROUND: CD8 T cells are thought to play an important role in protective
immunity to tuberculosis. The major histocompatibility complex class I subtype
HLA-A*0201 is one of the most prevalent class I alleles, with a frequency of over
30% in most populations. HLA-A*0201 transgenic, H-2D(b)/mouse beta2-microglobulin
double-knockout mice (HHD) which express human HLA-A*0201 but no mouse class 1,
was shown to provide a powerful model for studying induction of
HLA-A*0201-restricted immune responses in vivo.
METHODS: HHD mice were immunized with plasmid DNA encoding MPB51 by using a gene 
gun, and IFN-gamma production from the immune spleen cells was analyzed in
response to a synthetic overlapping peptide library covering the mature MPB51
sequence. catatonic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity was measured using cytotoxicity 
assay and the three-color flowcytometry was used to reveal IFN-gamma-producing
immune spleen cells.
RESULTS: Our findings were shown that only one peptide, p51-70, appeared to
stimulate the immune splenocytes to produce IFN-gamma. Flow cytometric analysis
with intracellular IFN-gamma and the T-cell phenotype revealed that the p51-70
peptide contains an immunodominant CD8+ T-cell epitope. Further analysis with
computer-assisted algorithms permitted identification of a T-cell nona mer
epitope, p54-62. Finally, we proved that the p54-62/HLA-A*0201 complex is
strongly recognized by HLA class I-restricted CD8+ MPB5 1-specific CTL cells.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that vaccination with MPB51 gene elicited
MPB51-specific CTL. In addition, the P54-62 epitope thus represent potential
subunit component for the design of vaccines against tuberculosis.
