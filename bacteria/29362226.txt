Tight junctions (TJs) involve close apposition of transmembrane proteins between 
cells. Although TJ proteins have been studied in detail, the role of lipids is
largely unknown. We addressed the role of very long-chain (VLC ≥26) ceramides in 
TJs using diabetes-induced loss of the blood-retinal barrier as a model. VLC
fatty acids that incorporate into VLC ceramides are produced by elongase
elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 4 (ELOVL4). ELOVL4 is
significantly reduced in the diabetic retina. Overexpression of ELOVL4
significantly decreased basal permeability, inhibited vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)- and interleukin-1β-induced permeability, and prevented
VEGF-induced decrease in occludin expression and border staining of TJ proteins
ZO-1 and claudin-5. Intravitreal delivery of AAV2-hELOVL4 reduced
diabetes-induced increase in vascular permeability. Ultrastructure and lipidomic 
analysis revealed that ω-linked acyl-VLC ceramides colocalize with TJ complexes. 
Overall, normalization of retinal ELOVL4 expression could prevent blood-retinal
barrier dysregulation in diabetic retinopathy through an increase in VLC
ceramides and stabilization of TJs.
