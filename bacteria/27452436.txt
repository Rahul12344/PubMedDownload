INTRODUCTION: Although uterine Natural Killer (uNK) cells have cytoplasmic
granules rich in perforin and granzymes, these cells do not degranulate in normal
pregnancy. DBA lectin(+) uNK cells produce angiogenic factors which stimulate
remodeling of uterine arterioles to increase blood flow within the growing
feto-placental unit. We sought to investigate the importance of COX-2 on mouse
pregnancy inoculated with Gram-negative bacteria Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by
treating with a selective COX-2 inhibitor (nimesulide).
METHODS: We have combined histochemical, immunohistochemical, stereological,
morphometric, behavioral, and litter analyses to investigate mouse pregnancy
inoculated with LPS with or without pre-treatment with nimesulide 30 min before
LPS injections, focusing on DBA(+) uNK cell response and viability of the
pregnancy.
RESULTS: LPS caused sickness behavior, an immature DBA(+) uNK influx, decreased
mature DBA(+) uNK cell numbers, and triggered a new DBA(low) uNK appearance.
These effects of LPS, except the sickness behavior, were prevented by nimesulide.
COX-2 inhibition also prevented the down-regulation of uNK perforin and spiral
arteriole α-actin expression stimulated by LPS. While the litter size from
Nimesulide + LPS-treated mothers was significantly smaller compared to those from
LPS-treated group, nimesulide alone showed no effect on the offspring.
DISCUSSION: Collectively, our data indicate that COX-2 changes angiogenic DBA(+) 
uNK cells in order to protect mouse pregnancy after LPS injection.
