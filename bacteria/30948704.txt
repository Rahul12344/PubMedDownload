Mitotic arrest deficient 1 (Mad1) plays a well-characterized role in the mitotic 
checkpoint. However, interphase roles of Mad1 that do not impact mitotic
checkpoint function remain largely uncharacterized. Here we show that
upregulation of Mad1, which is common in human breast cancer, prevents
stress-induced stabilization of the tumor suppressor p53 in multiple cell types. 
Upregulated Mad1 localizes to ProMyelocytic Leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in
breast cancer and cultured cells. The C-terminus of Mad1 directly interacts with 
PML, and this interaction is enhanced by sumoylation. PML stabilizes p53 by
sequestering MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation, to
the nucleolus. Upregulated Mad1 displaces MDM2 from PML, freeing it to
ubiquitinate p53. Upregulation of Mad1 accelerates growth of orthotopic mammary
tumors, which show decreased levels of p53 and its downstream effector p21. These
results demonstrate an unexpected interphase role for Mad1 in tumor promotion via
p53 destabilization.
