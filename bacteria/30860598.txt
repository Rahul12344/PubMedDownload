Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer (NK) cells represent a 
promising effector cell type for adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Both, genetically
modified donor-derived NK cells as well as continuously expanding NK-92 cells are
currently under clinical development. To enhance their therapeutic utility for
the treatment of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we engineered
NK-92 cells by lentiviral gene transfer to express a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
(FLT3)-specific CAR that contains a composite CD28-CD3ζ signaling domain. FLT3
has primarily been described as a therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia, 
but overexpression of FLT3 has also been reported in B-ALL. Exposure of
FLT3-positive targets to CAR NK-92 cells resulted in conjugate formation between 
NK and leukemia cells, NK-cell degranulation and selective cytotoxicity toward
established B-ALL cell lines and primary blasts that were resistant to parental
NK-92. In a SEM B-ALL xenograft model in NOD-SCID IL2R γnull mice, treatment with
CAR NK-92 but not parental NK-92 cells markedly inhibited disease progression,
demonstrating high antileukemic activity in vivo. As FLT3 is known to be also
expressed on precursor cells, we assessed the feasibility of incorporating an
inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) suicide switch to enhance safety of our approach.
Upon addition of the chemical dimerizer AP20187 to NK-92 cells coexpressing the
FLT3-specific CAR and iCasp9, rapid iCasp9 activation was observed, precluding
further CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data demonstrate that B-ALL can be
effectively targeted by FLT3-specific CAR NK cells which may complement
CD19-directed immunotherapies, particularly in cases of inherent or acquired
resistance to the latter.
