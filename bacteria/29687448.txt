BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Determine the presence of mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) in healthy periodontal tissue and periodontal granulation tissue (GT) and 
explore associations between immuno-regulatory molecules and selected subgingival
microorganisms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells were isolated, propagated and
characterised by flow cytometry from a region of healthy gingival tissue and
inflamed GT of 10 systemically healthy non-smokers with chronic periodontitis.
Tissue levels of immunoregulatory molecules were determined by qPCR and Gingival 
Crevicular Fluid (GCF) levels by ELISA. Subgingival plaque levels of periodontal 
pathogens were determined by qPCR RESULTS: Cells with MSC-properties were
isolated from both inflamed GT and healthy gingival (G) tissue. A
pro-inflammatory process predominated in GT which was partly reflected in GCF and
putative periodontal pathogens were higher at diseased sites. However, there was 
no significant difference in surface levels of mesenchymal (CD90, CD73, CD146,
CD271, STRO-1), endothelial (CD105, CD106), hematopoietic (CD34, CD45) and
embryonic (SSEA-4) stem cell markers between MSCs isolated from GT and G tissue.
CONCLUSION: Periodontal lesions, albeit inflamed, retain healing potential as
inferred by the presence of MSC-like cells with similar immunophenotypic
characteristics to those found in healthy periodontal tissue. Therefore, there
might be merits for healing in preserving sufficient GT in-situ during
periodontal surgery.
