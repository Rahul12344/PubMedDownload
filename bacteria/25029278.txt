Atomic force microscopy (AFM), which provides true 3D surface topography, can
also be used to determine the geometric parameters of proteins quantitatively at 
a single molecular level. In this paper, two different kinds of Escherichia coli 
MutS (MutS) protein were observed using AFM, and the geometric parameters of the 
proteins such as height, perimeter, area, and volume were measured. On the basis 
of these measurements, the molecular weight, association constant, oligomeric
state, and orientation of MutS proteins on a mica surface were deduced. The
oligomerization mechanism of MutS was analyzed in detail, and the results show
that two different kinds of interactions between MutS protein may be involved in 
oligomerization. Our results also show that AFM imaging is an accurate method for
analyzing the geometric structures of a single protein quantitatively at a
single-molecule level.
