Marine sediments are the largest carbon sink on earth. Nearly half of dark carbon
fixation in the oceans occurs in coastal sediments, but the microorganisms
responsible are largely unknown. By integrating the 16S rRNA approach,
single-cell genomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics with (14)C-carbon
assimilation experiments, we show that uncultured Gammaproteobacteria account for
70-86% of dark carbon fixation in coastal sediments. First, we surveyed the
bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity of 13 tidal and sublittoral sediments across
Europe and Australia to identify ubiquitous core groups of Gammaproteobacteria
mainly affiliating with sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. These also accounted for a
substantial fraction of the microbial community in anoxic, 490-cm-deep subsurface
sediments. We then quantified dark carbon fixation by scintillography of specific
microbial populations extracted and flow-sorted from sediments that were
short-term incubated with (14)C-bicarbonate. We identified three distinct
gammaproteobacterial clades covering diversity ranges on family to order level
(the Acidiferrobacter, JTB255 and SSr clades) that made up >50% of dark carbon
fixation in a tidal sediment. Consistent with these activity measurements,
environmental transcripts of sulfur oxidation and carbon fixation genes mainly
affiliated with those of sulfur-oxidizing Gammaproteobacteria. The
co-localization of key genes of sulfur and hydrogen oxidation pathways and their 
expression in genomes of uncultured Gammaproteobacteria illustrates an unknown
metabolic plasticity for sulfur oxidizers in marine sediments. Given their global
distribution and high abundance, we propose that a stable assemblage of
metabolically flexible Gammaproteobacteria drives important parts of marine
carbon and sulfur cycles.
