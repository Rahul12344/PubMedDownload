OBJECTIVE: T-helper (Th)-17 lymphocytes play a crucial role in maintenance and
regulation of gut immunity. Our laboratory has demonstrated that acute ethanol
(EtOH) exposure before burn injury results in intestinal T cell suppression and
enhanced bacterial translocation.
BACKGROUND: To extend these studies, we examined the effects of EtOH exposure and
burn injury on Th17 responses within intestinal lymphoid Peyer's patches (PP). We
further investigated whether restitution of interleukin (IL)-23 enhances PP cell 
IL-17 and IL-22 after EtOH and burn injury.
METHODS: Male mice, approximately 25 g, were gavaged with EtOH (2.9 mg/kg) before
receiving an approximately 12.5% total body surface area full thickness burn. One
day postinjury, PP mixed cells were cultured in the presence of plate-bound
anti-CD3/soluble anti-CD28 in the presence or absence of IL-23 for 48 hours.
Supernatants were harvested for IL-17 and IL-22 levels.
RESULTS: When combined with EtOH intoxication, burn injury significantly
decreased IL-17 and IL-22, as compared with sham injury. IL-23 treatment
successfully increased levels of IL-22 but not IL-17. This restoration was
prevented when PP cells were treated with CH-223191, an aryl hydrocarbon receptor
inhibitor. To further delineate the mechanism of differential IL-17 and IL-22
suppression, PP cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and
ionomycin, which signal via protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium flux. Treatment
with PMA and ionomycin significantly prevented the decrease in IL-17 but not
IL-22 after EtOH exposure and burn injury.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IL-23-mediated restoration of IL-22 is
aryl hydrocarbon receptor dependent, whereas IL-17 requires activation of protein
kinase C and intracellular calcium signaling.
