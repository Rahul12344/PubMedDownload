BACKGROUND: Gastroenteritis is the most common manifestation of nontyphoidal
Salmonella enterica infections, but little is known about the pathogenesis of
diarrhea in this infection
METHODS: To determine whether polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are required
for diarrhea for Salmonella colitis, we infected kanamycin-pretreated interleukin
8R (IL-8R) mutant mice and controls, both with nonmutant Slc11a1 (Nramp1, ItyR). 
We compared the 2 mouse strains for increases in fecal water content (diarrhea) 3
days after infection, changes in expression of ion transporters in colonic
epithelial cells, proliferation of epithelial cells, and severity of infection as
measured by colony-forming units (CFUs).
RESULTS: The IL-8R knockout mice had fewer PMNs in the colon but the other
variables we measured were unaffected except for an increase in CFUs in the
colon. The pathologic changes in the cecum were similar in both groups except for
the lack of PMNs in the IL-8R knockout mice. There was minimal damage to the
colon more distally.
CONCLUSIONS: In the early stage of Salmonella colitis, PMNs are not required for 
diarrhea or for the decrease in expression of colonic epithelial cell apical ion 
transporters. They contribute to defense against infection in the cecum but not
extracolonically at this stage of Salmonella colitis.
