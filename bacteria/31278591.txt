Phenolic compounds could pose environmental problems if they are in excess,
although they could be a renewable resource of substances with industrial
interest. The novel strain Bacillus aryabhattai BA03 is able to produce
high-added value metabolites from different phenolic compounds such as vanillin, 
4-vinylguaiacol and 4-vinylphenol while inducing ligninolytic enzymes such as
laccases (Lac) and lignin peroxidases (LiP). In comparison with the medium
without inducers, the presence of 500 mg/L caffeic acid improved 9.1-fold times
the expression of Lac (0.118 ± 0.004 U/mL) and 5.8-fold times the expression of
LiP (2.300 ± 0.053 U/mL), just as these processes exhibited high global rates of 
biotransformation. When isoeugenol, ferulic acid or p-coumaric acid are in the
media, the strain removed more than 90% of these compounds, secreting vanillin,
4-vinylguaiacol or 4-vinylphenol. Bacillus aryabhattai proved to be an
appropriate tool for the removal of several phenolic compounds and the production
of more valuable products.
