The cytokine IL-9, derived primarily from T-helper 9 (Th9) lymphocytes, promotes 
expansion of the Th2 subset and is implicated in the mechanisms of allergic
asthma. We hypothesize that IL-9 also has a role in human allergic contact
dermatitis (ACD). To investigate this hypothesis, skin biopsy specimens of
positive patch-test sites from non-atopic patients were assayed using
quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The cytokines IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-17A,
IL-9, and PU.1, a Th9 associated transcription factor, were elevated when
compared with paired normal skin. Immunohistochemistry on ACD skin biopsies
identified PU.1+ CD3+ and PU.1+ CD4+ cells, consistent with Th9 lymphocytes, in
the inflammatory infiltrate. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
nickel-allergic patients, but not nonallergic controls, show significant IL-9
production in response to nickel. Blocking studies with mAbs to HLA-DR (but not
HLA-A, -B, -C) or chloroquine significantly reduced this nickel-specific IL-9
production. In addition, blockade of IL-9 or IL-4 enhanced allergen-specific
IFN-γ production. A contact hypersensitivity model using IL-9(-/-) mice shows
enhanced Th1 lymphocyte immune responses, when compared with wild-type mice,
consistent with our human in vitro data. This study demonstrates that IL-9,
through its direct effects on Th1 and ability to promote IL-4 secretion, has a
regulatory role for Th1 lymphocytes in ACD.
