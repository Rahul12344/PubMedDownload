Positive selection of CD8 T cells in the thymus is thought to be a multistep
process lasting 3-4 d; however, the discrete steps involved are poorly
understood. Here, we examine phenotypic changes, calcium signaling, and
intrathymic migration in a synchronized cohort of MHC class I-specific thymocytes
undergoing positive selection in situ. Transient elevations in intracellular
calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) and migratory pauses occurred throughout the
first 24 h of positive selection, becoming progressively briefer and accompanied 
by a gradual shift in basal [Ca(2+)]i over time. Changes in chemokine-receptor
expression and relocalization from the cortex to medulla occurred between 12 and 
24 h after the initial encounter with positive-selecting ligands, a time frame at
which the majority of thymocytes retain CD4 and CD8 expression and still require 
T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling to efficiently complete positive selection. Our
results identify distinct phases in the positive selection of MHC class
I-specific thymocytes that are distinguished by their TCR-signaling pattern and
intrathymic location and provide a framework for understanding the multistep
process of positive selection in the thymus.
