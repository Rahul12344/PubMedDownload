Molecules from some pathogenic bacteria mimic natural host cell ligands and
trigger engulfment of the bacterium after specifically interacting with
cell-surface receptors. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein InlB of 
Listeria monocytogenes is one such molecule. It triggers bacterial entry by
interacting with the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF-R or Met) and two
other cellular components: gC1q-R and proteoglycans. Recent studies point to
significant similarities between the molecular mechanisms underlying
InlB-mediated entry into cells and classic phagocytosis. In addition, InlB, in
common with HGF, activates signaling cascades that are not involved in bacterial 
entry. Therefore, studies of InlB may help us to analyze the previously noticed
similarities between growth factor receptor activation and phagocytosis.
