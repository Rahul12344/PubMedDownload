The sequencing of the first complete bacterial genome in 1995 heralded a new era 
of hope for antibacterial drug discoverers, who now had the tools to search
entire genomes for new antibacterial targets. Several companies, including
GlaxoSmithKline, moved back into the antibacterials area and embraced a
genomics-derived, target-based approach to screen for new classes of drugs with
novel modes of action. Here, we share our experience of evaluating more than 300 
genes and 70 high-throughput screening campaigns over a period of 7 years, and
look at what we learned and how that has influenced GlaxoSmithKline's
antibacterials strategy going forward.
