Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder estimated to
affect 1 in 110 children in the U.S., yet the pathology of this disorder is not
fully understood. Abnormal levels of several growth factors have been
demonstrated in adults with ASD, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Both of these growth factors serve important
roles in neurodevelopment and immune function. In this study, concentrations of
EGF and HGF were assessed in the plasma of 49 children with ASD aged 2-4 years
old and 31 typically developing controls of a similar age as part of the Autism
Phenome Project (APP). Levels of EGF were significantly reduced in the ASD group 
compared to typically developing controls (P = 0.003). There were no significant 
differences in HGF levels in young children with ASD and typically developing
controls. EGF plays an important role in regulating neural growth, proliferation,
differentiation and migration, and reduced levels of this molecule may negatively
impact neurodevelopment in young children with ASD.
