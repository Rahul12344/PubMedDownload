This study evaluated the cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity of analogs of
cationic peptides against microorganisms associated with endodontic infections.
L-929 fibroblasts were exposed to LL-37, KR-12-a5 and hBD-3-1CV and chlorhexidine
(CHX, control), and cell metabolism was evaluated with MTT. The minimal
inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimal bactericidal/fungicidal
concentration (MBC/MFC) of the peptides and CHX were determined against oral
pathogens associated with endodontic infections. Enterococcus faecalis and
Streptococcus mutans biofilms were cultivated in bovine dentin blocks, exposed to
different concentrations of the most efficient antimicrobial peptide and analyzed
by confocal laser scanning microscopy. CHX and peptides affected the metabolism
of L-929 at concentrations > 31.25 and 500 μg ml-1, respectively. Among the
peptides, KR-12-a5 inhibited growth of both the microorganisms tested with the
lowest MIC/MBC/MFC values. In addition, KR-12-a5 significantly reduced E.
faecalis and S. mutans biofilms inside dentin tubules. In conclusion, KR-12-a5 is
a non-cytotoxic agent with potent antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity against
oral pathogens associated with endodontic infections.
