1. Schisandra chinensis, also called wuweizi in Chinese, is the fruit of
Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill., and has been officially utilized as an
astringent tonic for more than two thousand years in China. This study aims to
evaluate the inhibition of carboxylesterases (CESs) by the major ingredients
isolated from Schisandra chinensis, including Anwuligan, Schisandrol B,
Schisanhenol, deoxyschizandrin, and Schisandrin B. 2. In vitro human liver
microsomes (HLMs)-catalyzed hydrolysis of 2-(2-Benzoyl-3-methoxyphenyl)
benzothiazole (BMBT) and fluorescein diacetate (FD) was employed as the probe
reaction for CES1 and CES2, respectively. Initial screening, inhibition kinetics 
determination (inhibition type and parameters (Ki)), and in silico docking method
were carried out. 3. Schisandrin B showed strong inhibition on the activity of
CES1, and the activity of CES2 was strongly inhibited by Anwuligan and
Schisandrin B. Schisandrin B exhibited noncompetitive inhibition towards CES1 and
CES2. Anwuligan showed competitive inhibition towards CES2. The inhibition
kinetic parameters (Ki) were calculated to be 29.8, 0.6, and 8.1 uM for the
inhibition of Schisandrin B on CES1, Anwuligan on CES2, and Schisandrin B on
CES2. In silico docking showed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions
contributed to the inhibition of Schisandrin B on CES1, Anwuligan on CES2, and
Schisandrin B on CES2. All these information will be helpful for understanding
the adverse effects of Schisandra chinensis due to the inhibition of
CESs-catalyzed metabolism.
