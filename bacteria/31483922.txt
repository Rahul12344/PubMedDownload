Metronidazole, a widely used drug for the treatment of infections with anaerobic 
and facultative anaerobic bacteria and protozoa, can frequently cause
metronidazole-induced cutaneous adverse reactions (McADRs). The aim of the
present study was to investigate the association between human leucocyte antigen 
(HLA) alleles and McADRs in a Chinese Han population. The frequency of
HLA-B*24:02 carriers among the McADR patients was 73.3%, which was significantly 
higher than that of the population controls (32.16%, OR = 5.80, 95%
CI = [1.80-18.72], Pc = 0.004) and of the metronidazole-tolerant patients
(26.67%, OR = 7.56, 95% CI = [2.02-28.35], Pc = 0.004). Molecular docking showed 
that metronidazole and one of its major metabolites had the potential to bind in 
the HLA groove and that there was a relatively stable binding state of the
HLA-B*24:02-metronidazole/the metabolite complex. The CDR3 repertoires of both T 
cell receptor (TCR)Vα and Vβ of the patients showed a significantly skewed or an 
oligoclonal distribution. The TCRVβ CDR3 of the patients shared a similar motif, 
"CASSxxxxxxQxF." The current study demonstrated that both the HLA-A*24:02 allele 
and TCR are involved in the pathogenesis of McADRs.
