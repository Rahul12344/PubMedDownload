Monocytes from patients with sepsis have a reduced capacity to produce cytokines,
a state referred to as immunoparalysis. To determine whether polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMNL) can be rendered hyporesponsive, PMNL from 6 healthy volunteers 
intravenously challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 4 ng/kg) were stimulated
ex vivo with heat-killed bacteria or LPS, and the release of the CXC chemokines
interleukin-8, epithelial-derived neutrophil attractant-78, and growth-related
oncogen-alpha was measured. At 1 and 2 h after LPS administration in vivo, PMNL
produced fewer CXC chemokines after stimulation with bacteria or LPS (all P<.05).
Serum obtained 2 h after in vivo administration of LPS did not influence
chemokine production by PMNL from 6 healthy volunteers not previously exposed to 
LPS. Thus, intravenous injection of LPS induces a refractory state of PMNL that
is not caused by soluble factors produced in response to in vivo exposure to LPS.
