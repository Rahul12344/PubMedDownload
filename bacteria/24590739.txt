Longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.) is a non-climacteric fruit with a short
postharvest life. The regulation of phospholipase D (PLD) activity closely
relates to postharvest browning and senescence of longan fruit. In this study, a 
novel cDNA clone of longan PLDδ (LgPLDδ) was obtained and registered in GenBank
(accession No. JF791814). The deduced amino acid sequence possessed all of the
three typical domains of plant PLDs, a C2 domain and two catalytic HxKxxxxD
motifs. The tertiary structure of LgPLDδ was further predicted. The western blot 
result showed that the LgPLDδ protein was specifically recognized by PLDδ
antibody. The Q-RT-PCR (real-time quantitative PCR) result showed that the level 
of LgPLDδ mRNA expression was higher in senescent tissues than in developing
tissues, which was also high in postharvest fruit. The western-blotting result
further certified the different expression of LgPLDδ. These results provided a
scientific basis for further investigating the mechanism of postharvest longan
fruit adapting to environmental stress.
