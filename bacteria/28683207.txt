Survival during lung injury requires a coordinated program of damage limitation
and rapid repair. CD34 is a cell surface sialomucin expressed by epithelial,
vascular, and stromal cells that promotes cell adhesion, coordinates inflammatory
cell recruitment, and drives angiogenesis. To test whether CD34 also orchestrates
pulmonary damage and repair, we induced acute lung injury in wild-type (WT) and
Cd34-/- mice by bleomycin administration. We found that Cd34-/- mice displayed
severe weight loss and early mortality compared with WT controls. Despite
equivalent early airway inflammation to WT mice, CD34-deficient animals developed
interstitial edema and endothelial delamination, suggesting impaired endothelial 
function. Chimeric Cd34-/- mice reconstituted with WT hematopoietic cells
exhibited early mortality compared with WT mice reconstituted with Cd34-/- cells,
supporting an endothelial defect. CD34-deficient mice were also more sensitive to
lung damage caused by influenza infection, showing greater weight loss and more
extensive pulmonary remodeling. Together, our data suggest that CD34 plays an
essential role in maintaining vascular integrity in the lung in response to
chemical- and infection-induced tissue damage.
