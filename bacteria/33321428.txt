A novel disialoganglioside 2 (GD2)-specific chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR)-modified T cell therapy against retinoblastoma (RB) were generated. GD2-CAR
consists of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) derived from a monoclonal
antibody, hu3F8, that is linked with the cytoplasmic signaling domains of CD28,
41BB, a CD3ζ, and an inducible caspase 9 death fusion partner. GD2 antigen is
highly expressed in Y79RB cell line and in several surgical RB tumor specimens.
In vitro co-culture experiments revealed the effective killing of Y79RB cells by 
GD2-CAR T cells, but not by control CD19-CAR T cells. The killing activities of
GD2-CAR T cells were diminished when repeatedly exposed to the tumor, due to an
attenuated expression of GD2 antigen on tumor cells and upregulation of
inhibitory molecules of the PD1 and PD-L1 axis in the CAR T cells and RB tumor
cells respectively. This is the first report to describe the potential of GD2-CAR
T cells as a promising therapeutic strategy for RB with the indication of
potential benefit of combination therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
