Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Mtb) results in the generation of
protective cellular immunity and formation of granulomatous structures in the
lung. CXCL13, CCL21, and CCL19 are constitutively expressed in the secondary
lymphoid organs and play a dominant role in the homing of lymphocytes and
dendritic cells. Although it is known that dendritic cell transport of Mtb from
the lung to the draining lymph node is dependent on CCL19/CCL21, we show in this 
study that CCL19/CCL21 is also important for the accumulation of Ag-specific
IFN-gamma-producing T cells in the lung, development of the granuloma, and
control of mycobacteria. Importantly, we also show that CXCL13 is not required
for generation of IFN-gamma responses, but is essential for the spatial
arrangement of lymphocytes within granulomas, optimal activation of phagocytes,
and subsequent control of mycobacterial growth. Furthermore, we show that these
chemokines are also induced in the lung during the early immune responses
following pulmonary Mtb infection. These results demonstrate that homeostatic
chemokines perform distinct functions that cooperate to mediate effective
expression of immunity against Mtb infection.
