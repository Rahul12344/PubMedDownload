INTRODUCTION: Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is the most common causative pathogen
in community-acquired pneumonia and sepsis. Activated protein C (APC) has been
implicated as an important anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory mediator. We here 
sought to determine the role of the anticoagulant and cytoprotective functions of
endogenous APC during pneumonia and sepsis caused by S. pneumoniae.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Mice were treated intraperitoneally with monoclonal antibody
(mAb) 1609 (which inhibits both anticoagulant and cytoprotective effects of APC),
mAb 1591 (which inhibits only the anticoagulant effects of APC) or a control
antibody mAb prior to infection with viable S. pneumoniae via the airways (to
induce pneumonia) or via the tail vein (to induce primary sepsis). Mice were
analyzed at 24 or 48 hours after infection.
RESULTS: mAb 1609, but not mAb 1591, enhanced the procoagulant response to
pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis, as indicated by elevated levels of
thrombin-antithrombin complexes and D-dimer in plasma and lungs. mAb 1609 only
modestly affected the fibrinolytic response (elevated plasma and lung levels of
the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor type I during sepsis) 
and cytokine release (elevated plasma interleukin-6 concentrations during
pneumonia).
CONCLUSION: The cytoprotective effects of endogenous APC reduce activation of
coagulation during murine pneumococcal pneumonia and sepsis.
