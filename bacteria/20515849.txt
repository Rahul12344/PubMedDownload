The tumor microenvironment plays a fundamental role in both the organization of
and the escape from anticancer immune response. Recent experimental approaches in
anticancer therapy show that some anticancer chemotherapeutics--at a different
dosage than usually used--can improve tumor control by acting on immunity and can
also be used in immunosuppressive treatments. These apparently contrasting
effects may provide an explanation by looking at the cancer immunity from a
different perspective. Basing our hypothesis on the current inflammatory cancer
microenvironment model, we suggest that the tumor escape may derive from a
conflict between a deregulated local immune response and the application by the
systemic immunity of a homeostatic regulation, physiologically used for
terminating inflammatory processes. This regulation applied to the tumor
microenvironment can contribute to impede the efficacy of anticancer responses.
Therefore, we suggest recovering the anticancer response by paradoxically
inducing a temporary immune suppression ("resetting" effect). In this paper, we
review present concepts about inflammation and immunity in the cancer
microenvironment, as well as experimental data from recent literature supporting 
this paradoxical intervention hypothesis.
