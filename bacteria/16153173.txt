Genome-wide studies of mRNA regulation and phenotypic responses have shown that
eukaryotic cells mount a robust and multifaceted response upon exposure to
DNA-damaging agents. The integration of theses studies over frameworks provided
by protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and subcellular
localization information have led to the identification of networked responses to
damage. Taken together, these studies illustrate that cellular protection from
DNA and other macromolecular damage involves an intricate network of proteins
involved in many different cellular functions, some of them expected (e.g., DNA
repair and cell cycle checkpoints) but many of them unexpected (e.g., protein
trafficking and degradation). This review highlights many of the studies that
detail genome-wide responses to DNA-damaging agents and examines how these
datasets have been used to build a systems view of cellular responses to damage.
