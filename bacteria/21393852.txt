An organic solvent-tolerant lipase from Bacillus sp. strain 42 was crystallized
using the capillary-tube method. The purpose of studying this enzyme was in order
to better understand its folding and to characterize its properties in organic
solvents. By initially solving its structure in the native state, further studies
on protein-solvent interactions could be performed. X-ray data were collected at 
2.0 Å resolution using an in-house diffractometer. The estimated crystal
dimensions were 0.09×0.19×0.08 mm. The crystal belonged to the monoclinic space
group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=117.41, b=80.85, c=99.44 Å, β=96.40°.
