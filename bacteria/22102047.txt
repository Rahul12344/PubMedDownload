PaaX is the main regulator of the phenylacetic acid aerobic degradation pathway
in bacteria and acts as a transcriptional repressor in the absence of its inducer
phenylacetyl-coenzyme A. The natural presence and the recent accumulation of a
variety of highly toxic aromatic compounds owing to human pollution has created
considerable interest in the study of degradation pathways in bacteria, the most 
important microorganisms capable of recycling these compounds, in order to design
and apply novel bioremediation strategies. PaaX from Escherichia coli W was
cloned, overexpressed, purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop
vapour-diffusion method at 291 K. Crystals grew from a mixture of 0.9 M
Li(2)SO(4) and 0.5 M sodium citrate pH 5.8. These crystals, which belonged to the
monoclinic space group C2 with unit-cell parameters a = 167.88, b = 106.23, c =
85.87 Å, β = 108.33°, allowed the collection of an X-ray data set to 2.3 Å
resolution.
