The contribution of B7 molecules to the induction and maintenance of the T-cell
response to the human pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans was investigated.
T-cell activation by C. neoformans was regulated by B7 molecules. This
costimulatory signal was necessary for initiation and maintenance of the T-cell
response, through early and late requirements for B7-CD28 interaction. Blocking
B7-2 inhibited the normal T-cell proliferative response. This inhibition was due,
in part, to a reduced capability of T cells to produce interleukin-2 (IL-2). In
contrast, the same T-cell population produced more interferon-gamma. Suppression 
of the normal lymphoproliferation and IL-2 secretion responses to encapsulated C.
neoformans by antibodies to B7 was largely reversed by addition of the monoclonal
antibody 2H1, that is reactive with the major capsular polysaccharide,
glucuronoxylomannan. Overall, our data indicate that B7 molecules play a critical
role in T-cell activation by C. neoformans and suggest that appropriate
manipulation could drive T helper type 1 cell development.
