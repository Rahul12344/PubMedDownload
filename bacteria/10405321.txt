In order to study the origin of the polymorphism of MHC class I molecules, we
have cloned and sequenced five new Patr-A, -B, and -C loci alleles from two
chimpanzees. Previous studies of sequence comparison between Patr and HLA class I
alleles revealed that many of the sequence motifs were shared and the origin of
class I molecules predated the divergence of chimpanzees and humans. These
findings are confirmed by our current study. Additionally, our data suggest
significant differences between mechanisms of evolution of the A, B, and C loci: 
(1) The B locus is characterized by frequent nucleotide substitutions, whereas
the A and C loci are relatively more conserved; (2) However, unlike the A locus, 
the alpha2 domains of the C locus sequenced appear to produce MHC polymorphism
between these species. These differences might imply the distinctive
contributions of each locus during the evolutionary history.
