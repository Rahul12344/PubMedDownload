The aim of the experiment was to examine the effect of a diet enriched with
Lactobacillus plantarum and/or β-glucan on the immune parameters in the juvenile 
tench (Tinca tinca). Fish were fed for 14 days different diets (phase 1 of the
experiment), a dry commercial starter feed in the control group or the same feed 
supplemented with: 1% β-1,3/1,6-glucan in group G, 108 cfu L. plantarum g-1 in
group L, 1% β-1,3/1,6-glucan + 108 cfu L. plantarum g-1 in group G+L. During
consecutive 14 days all fish were fed the commercial feed alone (phase 2). The
stimulating effects of the tested preparations was evaluated twice, at the end of
each experimental phase. Dietary supplementation of β-1,3/1,6-glucan considerably
improved the humoral innate immune response (activity of lysozyme and total Ig)
and the pinocytotic activity of phagocytes. Supplement of L. plantarum improved
the ability of the head kidney phagocytes (RBA) to carry out oxygen burst in L
and G+L groups. A similar effect was observed for the killing activity of
phagocytes (PKA) from the head kidney after the stimulation of A. hydrophila, and
the effect persisted for two weeks after the commercial feed regime was resumed. 
A significant increase in the proliferative activity of B lymphocytes originating
from the head kidney was observed in groups L and G+L. The study has revealed
that the addition of the tested G+L synbiotic to dry diet stimulates the innate
immune response mechanisms in the juvenile tench.
