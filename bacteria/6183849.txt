Normal human serum antibodies to the protein complex more than 20 common
(species-specific) STr. Pneumoniae antigens have been studied. In commercial lots
of gamma globulin, manufactured during the last 8 years, antibodies to 9
pneumococcal antigens have been detected. The spectrum of antibodies and the
intensity of reactions Str. pneumoniae has been found to be not inferior to Str. 
aureus and pyogenes (group A) and to considerably exceed Str. faecalis,
Enterobacteriaceae, St. epidermidis, Str. salivarius, Str. viridans, N. perflava,
Ps. aeruginosa, H. influenzae, B. bifidum.
