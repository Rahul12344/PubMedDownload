Role of colonic bacteria in the pathophysiology of fecal peritonitis.

Rink RD, Short BL, Van Van N, Fry DE.

This study was designed to clarify the role of colonic bacteria in the reactions 
accompanying fecal peritonitis. Rats were subjected to septic or nonseptic
peritonitis induced by fresh fecal suspensions or suspensions pretreated with
heat or antibiotic. Measurements during 8 hr in rats with septic peritonitis
recorded bacteremia, hypoglycemia dn progressive hemoconcentration, lactacidemia,
and hypocapnea. Mortality was 100% by 24 hr. Nonseptic peritonitis produced
significantly lesser degrees of hemoconcentration and hypocapnea. Plasma lactate 
remained in control ranges while plasma glucose concentrations increased
slightly. Mortality was 5% in 24 hr. Parameters in control rats were stable over 
8 hr. Hepatic oxygen supply was estimated in each group by multiple platinum wire
electrodes. Severe hepatic hypoxia was recorded by 6 hr in rats with septic
peritonitis. By contrast, nonseptic peritonitis caused a comparatively mild
degree of hypoxia. The pathophysiologic developments in septic rats appear to be 
largely the result of hypovolemia induced by colonic bacteria. Administration of 
a colloid solution was effective in preventing its development.
