Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, a heterogeneous T cell population obtained
by in vitro differentiation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC),
represent a promising immunological approach in cancer. Numerous studies have
explored the role of CD38, CD39, CD203a/PC-1, and CD73 in generating
extracellular adenosine (ADO) and thus in shaping the tumor niche in favor of
proliferation. The findings shown here reveal that CIK cells are able to produce 
extracellular ADO via traditional (CD39/CD73) and/or alternative
(CD38/CD203a/CD73 or CD203a/CD73) pathways. Transcriptome analysis showed the
mRNA expression of these molecules and their modulation during PBMC to CIK
differentiation. When PBMC from normal subjects or cancer bearing patients were
differentiated into CIK cells under normoxic conditions, CD38 and CD39 were
greatly up-regulated while the number of CD203a, and CD73 positive cells
underwent minor changes. Since hypoxic conditions are often found in tumors, we
asked whether CD39, CD38, CD203a, and CD73 expressed by CIK cells were modulated 
by hypoxia. PBMC isolated from cancer patients and differentiated into CIK cells 
in hypoxic conditions did not show relevant changes in CD38, CD39, CD73, CD203a, 
and CD26. CIK cells also expressed A1, A2A, and A2B ADO receptors and they only
underwent minor changes as a consequence of hypoxia. The present study sheds
light on a previously unknown functional aspect of CIK cells, opening the
possibility of pharmacologically modulated ADO-generating ectoezymes to improve
CIK cells performance.
