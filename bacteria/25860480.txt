BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever, caused by the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhi, is a major cause of community-acquired bacteremia and
death worldwide. S100A8 (MRP8) and S100A9 (MRP14) form bioactive antimicrobial
heterodimers (calprotectin) that can activate Toll-like receptor 4, promoting
lethal, endotoxin-induced shock and multi-organ failure. We aimed to characterize
the expression and function of S100A8/A9 in patients with typhoid fever and in a 
murine invasive Salmonella model.
METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: S100A8/A9 protein levels were determined in acute
phase plasma or feces from 28 Bangladeshi patients, and convalescent phase plasma
from 60 Indonesian patients with blood culture or PCR-confirmed typhoid fever,
and compared to 98 healthy control subjects. To functionally characterize the
role of S100A8/A9, we challenged wildtype (WT) and S100A9-/- mice with S.
Typhimurium and determined bacterial loads and inflammation 2- and 5- days post
infection. We further assessed the antimicrobial function of recombinant
S100A8/A9 on S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi replication in vitro. Typhoid fever
patients demonstrated a marked increase of S100A8/A9 in acute phase plasma and
feces and this increases correlated with duration of fever prior to admission.
S100A8/A9 directly inhibited the growth of S. Typhimurium and S. Typhi in vitro
in a dose and time dependent fashion. WT mice inoculated with S. Typhimurium
showed increased levels of S100A8/A9 in both the liver and the systemic
compartment but S100A9-/- mice were indistinguishable from WT mice with respect
to bacterial growth, survival, and inflammatory responses, as determined by
cytokine release, histopathology and organ injury.
CONCLUSION: S100A8/A9 is markedly elevated in human typhoid, correlates with
duration of fever prior to admission and directly inhibits the growth of S.
Typhimurium and S. Typhi in vitro. Despite elevated levels in the murine invasive
Salmonella model, S100A8/A9 does not contribute to an effective host response
against S. Typhimurium in mice.
