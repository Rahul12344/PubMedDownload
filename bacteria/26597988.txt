Staphylococcus aureus uses the two-component regulatory system GraRS to sense and
respond to host defense peptides (HDPs). However, the mechanistic impact of GraS 
or its extracellular sensing loop (EL) on HDP resistance is essentially
unexplored. Strains with null mutations in the GraS holoprotein (ΔgraS) or its EL
(ΔEL) were compared for mechanisms of resistance to HDPs of relevant immune
sources: neutrophil α-defensin (human neutrophil peptide 1 [hNP-1]), cutaneous
β-defensin (human β-defensin 2 [hBD-2]), or the platelet kinocidin congener RP-1.
Actions studied by flow cytometry included energetics (ENR); membrane
permeabilization (PRM); annexin V binding (ANX), and cell death protease
activation (CDP). Assay conditions simulated bloodstream (pH 7.5) or
phagolysosomal (pH 5.5) pH contexts. S. aureus strains were more susceptible to
HDPs at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.5, and each HDP exerted a distinct effect signature. 
The impacts of ΔgraS and ΔΕL on HDP resistance were peptide and pH dependent.
Both mutants exhibited defects in ANX response to hNP-1 or hBD-2 at pH 7.5, but
only hNP-1 did so at pH 5.5. Both mutants exhibited hyper-PRM, -ANX, and -CDP
responses to RP-1 at both pHs and hypo-ENR at pH 5.5. The actions correlated with
ΔgraS or ΔΕL hypersusceptibility to hNP-1 or RP-1 (but not hBD-2) at pH 7.5 and
to all study HDPs at pH 5.5. An exogenous EL mimic protected mutant strains from 
hNP-1 and hBD-2 but not RP-1, indicating that GraS and its EL play nonredundant
roles in S. aureus survival responses to specific HDPs. These findings suggest
that GraS mediates specific resistance countermeasures to HDPs in immune contexts
that are highly relevant to S. aureus pathogenesis in humans.
