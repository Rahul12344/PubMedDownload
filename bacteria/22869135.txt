Pac17 is an uncharacterized protein from the pacidamycin gene cluster of the soil
bacterium Streptomyces coeruleorubidus. It is implicated in the biosynthesis of
the core diaminobutyric acid residue of the antibiotic, although its precise role
is uncertain at present. Given that pacidamycins inhibit translocase I of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a clinically unexploited antibiotic target, they offer
new hope in the search for antibacterial agents directed against this important
pathogen. Crystals of Pac17 were grown by vapour diffusion and X-ray data were
collected at a synchrotron to a resolution of 1.9 Å from a single crystal. The
crystal belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 214.12,
b = 70.88, c = 142.22 Å, β = 92.96°. Preliminary analysis of these data suggests 
that the asymmetric unit consists of one Pac17 homotetramer, with an estimated
solvent content of 49.0%.
