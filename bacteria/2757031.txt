The Hutterites are an Anabaptist population, highly inbred, with large family
sizes and extensively documented pedigrees. As part of genetic-epidemiologic
studies of the impact of HLA on fertility, HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ typing was
performed on a total of 650 Schmiedenleut Hutterities in South Dakota. An
extraordinary degree of homogeneity was found. HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, -A24, and -A26
accounted for 83%, HLA-B8, -B27, -B35, -B51, -Bw60, and -Bw62 for 75%, and
HLA-DR1, -DR2, -DR3, and -DR4 for 66% of the antigens at the respective HLA-A,
-B, and -DR loci. All Hutterites characterized for HLA were descendants of no
more than 78 ancestors. However, family analysis identified only 45 unique HLA
haplotypes thought to reflect the original gene pool. Eight haplotypes were
particularly frequent, accounting for nearly 50% of all observed haplotypes; four
of these were consistent with a European ancestry. Coefficients measuring linkage
disequilibrium were computed from haplotypes identified by family analysis.
Overall, HLA analysis portrayed the Schmiedenleut Hutterities as a homogeneous
and unique population, with disequilibrium among particular alleles and a
spectrum of common and uncommon European haplotypes.
