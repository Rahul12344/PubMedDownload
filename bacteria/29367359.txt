A 14-year-old boy presented with low-grade fever, widespread myalgia and
difficulty in walking and standing 2 days after the undocumented trip which
brought him from western Africa to Italy. His serum creatine phosphokinase was
markedly elevated. He was diagnosed with rhabdomyolysis and was volume-restored
with normal saline and bicarbonate-containing fluid. Anamnesis revealed illegal, 
not well-specified, forced consumption in his fatherland, and very bad conditions
of the trip (prolonged immobility, dehydration, hypothermia). Workup included a
respiratory microbiological panel which was positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae
Other microbiological agents were excluded. After 3 weeks, he recovered complete 
motility. Undocumented immigrants may present several risk factors for
rhabdomyolysis that give to this group of individuals a higher risk of developing
this disorder.
