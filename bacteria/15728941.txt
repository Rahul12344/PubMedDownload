Bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against Streptococcus
mutans and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner by the presence of saliva and/or serum. Increasing the concentration of
hBD-3 partially overcame this inhibition. A fast bactericidal effect was observed
against both bacterial strains, suggesting a potential therapeutic use for hBD-3 
in the local treatment of oral infections.
