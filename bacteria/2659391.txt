Investigating HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DR antigens, MLR, CML, and PLT
reactivity in two unrelated persons it was found that despite their HLA-D/DR
identity cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) could be induced in the CML assay. The
HLA-DP antigens proved to provide the necessary proliferative impetus for the
generation of CTL.
