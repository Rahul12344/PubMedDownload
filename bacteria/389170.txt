Bacteriological monitoring of unheated human milk.

Davidson DC, Poll RA, Roberts C.

To assess the bacteriological quality of unpooled expressed breast milk, a pilot 
bottle sample of each donation was examined before the milk was given to the
neonate. Provided the milk did not contain greater than 2500 organisms/ml or
potential pathogens it was used unheated. Milk containing between 2500 and 5000
organisms/ml and no potential pathogens was used after pasteurisation. Using
these criteria, 67% of 460 donations were acceptable. However, because the
bacteriological quality varied, 45% of domiciliary donations were discarded
compared with only 29% of those from hospital.
