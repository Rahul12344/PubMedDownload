Malignant melanoma incidence has been increasing for over 30 years, and despite
promising new therapies, metastatic disease remains difficult to treat. We
describe preliminary results from a Phase I clinical trial (NCT01586403) of
adoptive cell therapy in which three patients received autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells transduced with a lentivirus carrying a tyrosinase-specific TCR and a
marker protein, truncated CD34 (CD34t). This unusual MHC Class I-restricted TCR
produces functional responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Parameters monitored
on transduced T cells included activation (CD25, CD69), inhibitory (PD-1, TIM-3, 
CTLA-4), costimulatory (OX40), and memory (CCR7) markers. For the clinical trial,
T cells were activated, transduced, selected for CD34t+ cells, then re-activated,
and expanded in IL-2 and IL-15. After lymphodepleting chemotherapy, patients were
given transduced T cells and IL-2, and were followed for clinical and biological 
responses. Transduced T cells were detected in the circulation of three treated
patients for the duration of observation (42, 523, and 255 days). Patient 1
tolerated the infusion well but died from progressive disease after 6 weeks.
Patient 2 had a partial response by RECIST criteria then progressed. After
progressing, Patient 2 was given high-dose IL-2 and subsequently achieved
complete remission, coinciding with the development of vitiligo. Patient 3 had a 
mixed response that did not meet RECIST criteria for a clinical response and
developed vitiligo. In two of these three patients, adoptive transfer of
tyrosinase-reactive TCR-transduced T cells into metastatic melanoma patients had 
clinical and/or biological activity without serious adverse events.
