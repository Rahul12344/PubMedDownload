OBJECTIVES: We investigated the colonisation by Candida spp in patients using
orthodontic fixed appliances by characterising the isolated Candida strains and
by evaluating the host oral mucosa response through the measure of human
β-defensins 3 (HBD-3) expression and Interleukin-1ß/IL-10.
METHODS: Ninety patients were enrolled after signing an informed consent.
Prevalence, susceptibility to fluconazole, genotyping and oral fungal burden of
Candida sp. isolated were determined. Host responses were evaluated by measuring 
HBD-3 expression as well as IL-1ß and IL-10 in saliva.
RESULTS: The colonisation rate reached 6.7% (6/90), and 5 patients were colonised
with C. albicans strains and one with one with C. tropicalis. The fluconazole
MIC90/susceptibility of C. albicans strains ranged 1/0.25-1 μg/mL. However,
isolated strains did not present different genotype (SAB>0.9), C. albicans
colonisation seems to be influenced by the duration of treatment and by level
expression of HBD3 that were higher in colonised patients (not statistically
different). A negative correlation between the fungal burden and IL-1ß levels was
found in colonised patients but not for IL-10.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that patients with orthodontic fixed appliances
were mainly colonised by C. albicans, which was related to a decrease in HBD-3
expression and IL-1ß levels.
