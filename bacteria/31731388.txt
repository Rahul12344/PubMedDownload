Elaiophylins belong to a special family of 16-membered macrodiolides with
C2-symmetry. They have exhibited remarkable biological activities, such as
antimicrobial, anthelmintic, anticancer, immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory,
antiviral, and Î±-glucosidase inhibitory activities. A member of elaiophylins,
efomycin M, is as a specific small molecule inhibitor of selectin in preclinical 
trial for the treatment of psoriasis, ischemia-reperfusion, and allergy. The
biosynthetic investigation of elaiophylins has uncovered a unique thioesterase,
which is responsible for the formation of C2-symmetric diolide. We herein
summarize the natural occurrence, bioactivity, and biosynthesis of elaiophylins
covering the literatures from 1959 to 2019. Hopefully, this review will inspire
further research interests of these compounds and encourage the discovery of new 
analogues by metabolic engineering or genome mining.
