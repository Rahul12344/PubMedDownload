Antigen 43 (Ag43) is a cell-surface exposed protein of Escherichia coli secreted 
by the Type V, subtype a, secretion system (T5aSS) and belonging to the family of
self-associating autotransporters (SAATs). These modular proteins, comprising a
cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, a surface-exposed central passenger and an
outer membrane C-terminal translocator, self-recognise in a Velcro-like handshake
mechanism. A phylogenetic network analysis focusing on the passenger revealed for
the first time that they actually distribute into four distinct classes, namely
C1, C2, C3 and C4. Structural alignment and modelling analyses demonstrated these
classes arose from shuffling of two different subdomains within the Ag43
passengers. Functional analyses revealed that homotypic interactions occur for
all Ag43 classes but significant differences in the sedimentation kinetics and
aggregation state were present when Ag43C3 was expressed. In contrast,
heterotypic interaction occurred in a very limited number of cases. Single
cell-force spectroscopy demonstrated the importance of specific as well as
nonspecific interactions in mediating Ag43-Ag43 recognition. We propose that
structural differences in the subdomains of the Ag43 classes account for
different autoaggregation dynamics and propensities to co-interact.
