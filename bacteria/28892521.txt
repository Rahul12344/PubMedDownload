Autoantibody profiling with a systems medicine approach can help identify
critical dysregulated signaling pathways (SPs) in cancers. In this way,
immunoglobulins G (IgG) purified from the serum samples of 92 healthy controls,
10 pre-treated (PR) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients, and 20 NHL patients who 
underwent chemotherapy (PS) were screened with a phage-displayed random peptide
library. Protein-protein interaction networks of the PR and PS groups were
analyzed and visualized by Gephi. The results indicated AXIN2, SENP2, TOP2A,
FZD6, NLK, HDAC2, HDAC1, and EHMT2, in addition to CAMK2A, PLCG1, PLCG2, GRM5,
GRIN2B, GRIN2D, CACNA2D3, and SPTAN1 as hubs in 11 and 7 modules of PR and PS
networks, respectively. PR- and PS-specific hubs were evaluated in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome databases. The PR-specific 
hubs were involved in Wnt SP, signaling by Notch1 in cancer, telomere
maintenance, and transcriptional misregulation. In contrast, glutamate receptor
SP, Fc receptor-related pathways, growth factors-related SPs, and Wnt SP were
statistically significant enriched pathways, based on the pathway analysis of PS 
hubs. The results revealed that the most PR-specific proteins were associated
with events involved in tumor development, while chemotherapy in the PS group was
associated with side effects of drugs and/or cancer recurrence. As the findings
demonstrated, PR- and PS-specific proteins in this study can be promising
therapeutic targets in future studies.
