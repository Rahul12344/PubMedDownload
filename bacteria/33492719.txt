BACKGROUND: A prolonged prothrombin time (PT) is a common feature in sepsis
indicating consumptive coagulopathy.
OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between a prolonged PT and aberrations
in other host response mechanisms in sepsis.
METHODS: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with sepsis were divided in
quartiles according to the highest PT value measured within 24 h after admission.
The host response was evaluated by measuring 19 plasma biomarkers reflecting
pathways implicated in sepsis pathogenesis and by blood leukocyte gene expression
profiling.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1524 admissions for sepsis, 386 (25.3%)
involved patients with a normal PT (≤12.7 s); the remaining quartiles entailed
379 (24.9%) patients with a slightly prolonged PT (12.8 ≤ PT ≤ 15.0 s), 383
(25.1%) with an intermediately prolonged PT (15.1 ≤ PT ≤ 17.2 s), and 376 (24.7%)
with an extremely prolonged PT (≥17.3 s). While patients with an extremely
prolonged PT showed an increased crude mortality up to 1 year after admission,
none of the prolonged PT groups was independently associated with 30-day adjusted
mortality. Comparison of the host response between patients with a normal PT or
an extremely prolonged PT matched for baseline characteristics including severity
of disease showed that an extremely prolonged PT was associated with impaired
anticoagulant mechanisms, a more disturbed endothelial barrier integrity and
increased systemic inflammation, and blood leukocyte transcriptomes indicating
more prominent metabolic reprogramming and protein catabolism.
CONCLUSION: A prolonged PT is associated with stronger anomalies in pathways
implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis, suggesting that activation of
coagulation impacts other host response mechanisms.
