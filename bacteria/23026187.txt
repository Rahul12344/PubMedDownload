A 34-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with an acute
presentation of septic shock that required fluid and pressor support in the
Intensive Care Unit. History revealed this was her third episode of such a
presentation with asymptomatic periods in between. She responded well to medical 
interventions but reported persistent joint pain. Immunologic workup revealed her
diagnosis.
