Polymyxin B (1) monohydrochloride was converted to the tetra-BOC derivatives 1b
and 1c by reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. The structures of these
protected intermediates were established utilizing a degradative sequence that
afforded 3 and 5. A method for the deprotection 2,4-dinitrophenylamines to the
free amine, utilizing a strongly basic ion-exchange resin, was developed for use 
in the degradative sequence. The tetra-BOC derivatives 1b and 1c were used to
prepare several Polymyxin B derivatives 6-27 at the DAB1 and DAB9-gamma-amine.
The antibacterial activity of these selectively functionalized derivatives is
reported here.
