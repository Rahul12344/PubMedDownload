Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent cytokine of mesenchymal origin, exhibits
polytrophic physiological responses, including proliferation, migration, and
invasion, in a wide variety of cells. Although it is known that inhibition of the
responses by HGF variants was via signal transducers and activators of the
transcription pathway, the mechanisms of action of the variants involved in the
production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were not clearly understood. Thus,
recombinant HGF variants, NK1, NK2, NK3, and NK4 were topically applied to assays
for proliferation, migration, invasion, and expression of MMPs in the human lung 
cancer cell line A549 and compared to that of control medium and a
glutathione-s-transferase control. Results showed that these recombinant HGF
variants significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549
at >4 nM, downregulated expression of MMP-9, and upregulated expression of MMP-8.
The study clearly suggests that binding of the HGF variants to the cell surface
c-Met resulted in the downregulation of MMP-9, and upregulation of MMP-8 protein 
expressions might be key molecular signals against proliferation, migration, and 
invasion of A549 cells.
