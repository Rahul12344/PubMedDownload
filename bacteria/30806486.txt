In non-salmonid fish, Aeromonas salmonicidacan cause local infections with severe
skin ulcerations, known as atypical furunculosis. In this study, we present a
systemic infection by a virulent A. salmonicidain European perch (Perca
fluviatilis).This infection was diagnosed in a Swiss warm water recirculation
aquaculture system. The isolate of A.  salmonicida encodes a type three secretion
system (TTSS) most likely located on a plasmid similar to pAsa5/pASvirA, which is
known to specify one of the main virulence attributes of the species
A. salmonicida. However, the genes specifying the TTSS of the perch isolate show 
a higher temperature tolerance than strains isolated from cold-water fish. The
function of the TTSS in virulence was verified in a cytotoxicity test using
bluegill fry and epithelioma papulosum cyprinid cells.
