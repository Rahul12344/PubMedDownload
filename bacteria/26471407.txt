Autophagy plays a critical role in response to numerous cellular stresses, such
as nutrient deprivation, hypoxia, starvation and organelle damage. The disruption
of autophagy pathway affects multiple aspects of cellular stress response. Here
we for the first time identified Ccz1 as an essential component for autophagy in 
Candida albicans. Our experiments demonstrated that loss of CCZ1 gene led to
vacuolar fragmentation and disruption of the autophagy pathway. Our results also 
suggested that Ccz1 functioned in oxidative stress. In the ccz1Δ/Δ mutant, the
levels of reactive oxidative species (ROS) sharply increased under H2O2
treatment. Further studies demonstrated that breakdown of the autophagic
clearance pathway led to the accumulation of oxidative stress-damaged
mitochondria, and consequently elevated cellular ROS levels in the ccz1Δ/Δ
mutant. Furthermore, deletion of CCZ1 led to a significant defect in filamentous 
development at both 30°C and 37°C. The disruption of CCZ1 gene led to decreased
capacity of macrophage killing and increased sensitivity to the macrophages. In
addition, the ccz1Δ/Δ mutant exhibited attenuated virulence and decreased fungal 
burdens in the mouse systemic infection model, indicating that CCZ1 might provide
a promising target for antifungal drugs development. In summary, our findings
provide new insights into the understanding of autophagy-related gene in C.
albicans.
