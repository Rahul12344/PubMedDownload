In search of sustainable approaches to plastics production, many efforts have
been made to engineer microbial conversions of renewable feedstock to short-chain
(C2-C8) bifunctional polymer precursors (e.g., succinic acid, cadaverine,
1,4-butanediol). Less attention has been given to medium-chain (C12-C14) monomers
such as ω-hydroxy fatty acids (ω-OHFAs) and α,ω-dicarboxylic acids (α,ω-DCAs),
which are precursors to high performance polyesters and polyamides. Here we
engineer a complete microbial conversion of glucose to C12 and C14 ω-OHFAs and
α,ω-DCAs, with precise control of product chain length. Using an expanded
bioinformatics approach, we screen a wide range of enzymes across phyla to
identify combinations that yield complete conversion of intermediates to product 
α,ω-DCAs. Finally, through optimization of culture conditions, we enhance
production titer of C12 α,ω-DCA to nearly 600 mg/L. Our results indicate
potential for this microbial factory to enable commercially relevant, renewable
production of C12 α,ω-DCA-a valuable precursor to the high-performance plastic,
nylon-6,12.
