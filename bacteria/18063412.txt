Sepsis is a major health problem. The concept that sepsis mortality is the result
of an uncontrolled hyperinflammatory host response has recently been challenged. 
It is now widely thought that the host response to sepsis involves many,
concomitant, integrated, and often antagonistic processes that involve both
exaggerated inflammation and immune suppression. Several novel mediators and
pathways have been shown to play a part. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that 
microbial virulence and bacterial load contribute to the host response and the
outcome of severe infections. A complex and dynamic interaction exists between
pathogens and host immune-defence mechanisms during the course of invasive
infection. Some pathogens have acquired the capacity to communicate with each
other and sense the host's vulnerabilities. Bidirectional signals are detectable 
at the critical interface between the host and microbial invaders. The outcome of
this interaction determines the fate of the host at the outset of the septic
process. A formidable array of innate and acquired immune defences must be
breached if a pathogen is to successfully disseminate and cause severe sepsis and
septic shock. This Review summarises current knowledge of microbial pathogenesis 
and host-pathogen interactions during sepsis and the ensuing development of
potential therapeutics.
