BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether carbapenem-colistin combination therapy reduces 
the emergence of colistin resistance, compared to colistin monotherapy, when
given to patients with infections due to carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative
organisms.
METHODS: This is a pre-planned analysis of a secondary outcome from a randomized,
controlled trial comparing colistin monotherapy with colistin-meropenem
combination for the treatment of severe infections caused by
carbapenem-resistant, colistin-susceptible Gram-negative bacteria. We evaluated
rectal swabs taken on Day 7 or later for the presence of new colistin-resistant
(ColR) isolates. We evaluated the emergence of any ColR isolate and the emergence
of ColR Enterobacteriaceae (ColR-E).
RESULTS: Data were available for 214 patients for the primary analysis; emergent 
ColR organisms were detected in 22 (10.3%). No difference was observed between
patients randomized to treatment with colistin monotherapy (10/106, 9.4%) versus 
patients randomized to colistin-meropenem combination therapy (12/108, 11.1%; P =
.669). ColR-E organisms were detected in 18/249 (7.2%) patients available for
analysis. No difference was observed between the 2 treatment arms (colistin
monotherapy 6/128 [4.7%] vs combination therapy 12/121 [9.9%]; P = .111).
Enterobacteriaceae, as the index isolate, was found to be associated with
development of ColR-E (hazard ratio, 3.875; 95% confidence interval,
1.475-10.184; P = .006).
CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenem-colistin combination therapy did not reduce the incidence
of colistin resistance emergence in patients with infections due to
carbapenem-resistant organisms. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the
development of colistin resistance and methods for its prevention.
