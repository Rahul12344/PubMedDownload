AIMS: This study presents patient-reported quality of life (QoL) over the first
year following surgical debridement of long bone osteomyelitis. It assesses the
bone involvement, antimicrobial options, coverage of soft tissues, and host
status (BACH) classification as a prognostic tool and its ability to stratify
cases into 'uncomplicated' or 'complex'.
METHODS: Patients with long-bone osteomyelitis were identified prospectively
between June 2010 and October 2015. All patients underwent surgical debridement
in a single-staged procedure at a specialist bone infection unit. Self-reported
QoL was assessed prospectively using the three-level EuroQol five-dimension
questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) index score and visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) at five
postoperative time-points (baseline, 14 days, 42 days, 120 days, and 365 days).
BACH classification was applied retrospectively by two clinicians blinded to
outcome.
RESULTS: In total, 71 patients with long-bone osteomyelitis were included. There 
was significant improvement from time of surgery to one year postoperatively in
mean EQ-VAS (58.2 to 78.9; p < 0.001) and mean EQ-5D-3L index scores (0.284 to
0.740; p < 0.001). At one year following surgery, BACH 'uncomplicated'
osteomyelitis was associated with better QoL compared to BACH 'complex'
osteomyelitis (mean EQ-5D-3L 0.900 vs 0.685; p = 0.020; mean EQ-VAS 87.1 vs 73.6;
p = 0.043). Patients with uncomplicated bone involvement (BACH type B1, cavitary)
reported higher QoL at all time-points when compared to complex bone involvement 
(B2, segmental or B3, osteomyelitis involving a joint). Patients with good
antimicrobial options (Ax or A1) gave higher outcome scores compared to patients 
with multidrug-resistant isolates (A2). The need for microvascular tissue
transfer (C1 and C2) did not impact significantly on QoL. Patients without major 
comorbidities (uncomplicated, H1) reported higher QoL compared to those with
significant disease (complex, H2).
CONCLUSION: Uncomplicated osteomyelitis, as defined by BACH, gave higher
self-reported QoL when compared to complex cases. The bone involvement,
antimicrobial options, and host status variables were able to stratify patients
in terms of QoL. These data can be used to offer prognostic information to
patients who are undergoing treatment for long bone osteomyelitis. Cite this
