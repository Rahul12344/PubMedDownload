In type II polyketide synthases (PKSs), the ketosynthase-chain length factor
(KS-CLF) complex catalyzes polyketide chain elongation with the acyl carrier
protein (ACP). Highly reducing type II PKSs, represented by IgaPKS, produce
polyene structures instead of the well-known aromatic skeletons. Here, we report 
the crystal structures of the Iga11-Iga12 (KS-CLF) heterodimer and the covalently
cross-linked Iga10=Iga11-Iga12 (ACP=KS-CLF) tripartite complex. The latter
structure revealed the molecular basis of the interaction between Iga10 and
Iga11-Iga12, which differs from that between the ACP and KS of Escherichia coli
fatty acid synthase. Furthermore, the reaction pocket structure and site-directed
mutagenesis revealed that the negative charge of Asp 113 of Iga11 prevents
further condensation using a β-ketoacyl product as a substrate, which
distinguishes IgaPKS from typical type II PKSs. This work will facilitate the
future rational design of PKSs.
