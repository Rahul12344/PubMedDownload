Seven new chromone-containing polyketides, termed cystochromones A-G, were
isolated from the myxobacterial strain Cystobacter sp. MCy9104. Their structures 
were elucidated using comprehensive NMR spectroscopy and HR-MS/MS. Cystochromones
bear a pentadecyl moiety unusually attached at C-5 of the chromone ring.
Moreover, isotope-labeled substrate feeding experiments and NMR analysis
suggested a hybrid iso-fatty acid and polyketide synthase biosynthetic pathway
for these secondary metabolites.
