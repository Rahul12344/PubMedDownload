Polyomavirus middle T antigen does not overcome p53-mediated G(1) arrest in mouse
embryo fibroblasts. Middle T antigen still associates with the signaling
molecules phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and SHC and activates the transcriptional
activity of c-Myc and AP1 in p53-arrested cells. Examination of cell cycle
regulatory proteins indicated that p53 does not interfere with these mitogenic
signals but acts later in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle.
