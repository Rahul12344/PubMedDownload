NKT cells are unconventional T cells that respond to self and microbe-derived
lipid and glycolipid Ags presented by the CD1d molecule. Invariant NKT (iNKT)
cells influence immune responses in numerous diseases. Although only a few
studies have examined their role during intestinal inflammation, it appears that 
iNKT cells protect from Th1-mediated inflammation but exacerbate Th2-mediated
inflammation. Studies using iNKT cell-deficient mice and chemically induced
dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis have led to inconsistent results. In this
study, we show that CD1d-deficient mice, which lack all NKT cells, harbor an
altered intestinal microbiota that is associated with exacerbated intestinal
inflammation at steady-state and following DSS treatment. This altered
microbiota, characterized by increased abundance of the bacterial phyla
Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and TM7, among which the mucin-eating
Mucispirillum, as well as members of the genus Prevotella and segmented
filamentous bacteria, was transmissible upon fecal transplant, along with the
procolitogenic phenotype. Our results also demonstrate that this proinflammatory 
microbiota influences iNKT cell function upon activation during DSS colitis.
Collectively, alterations of the microbiota have a major influence on colitis
outcome and therefore have to be accounted for in such experimental settings and 
in studies focusing on iNKT cells.
