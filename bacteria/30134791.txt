Several neuronal guidance proteins, known as semaphorin molecules, function in
the immune system. This dual tissue performance has led to them being defined as 
"neuroimmune semaphorins". They have been shown to regulate T cell activation by 
serving as costimulatory molecules. Similar to classical costimulatory molecules,
neuroimmune semaphorins are either constitutively or inducibly expressed on
immune cells. In contrast to the classical costimulatory molecule function, the
action of neuroimmune semaphorins requires the presence of two signals, the first
one provided by TCR/MHC engagement, and the second one provided by B7/CD28
interaction. Thus, neuroimmune semaphorins serve as a "signal three" for immune
cell activation and regulate the overall intensity of immune response. The
current knowledge on their structures, multiple receptors, specific
cell/tissue/organ expression, and distinct functions in different diseases are
summarized and discussed in this review.
