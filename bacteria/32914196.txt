STUDY QUESTION: Whether the testis-specific extracellular vesicle (EV) long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in seminal plasma could be utilized to predict the
presence of testicular spermatozoa in nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Our findings indicate that the panel based on seminal plasma EV
lncRNAs was a sensitive and specific method in predicting the presence of
testicular spermatozoa and may improve clinical decision-making of NOA.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The adoption of sperm retrieval techniques, especially
microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE), in combination with ICSI has
revolutionized treatment for NOA. However, there are no precise and noninvasive
methods for predicting whether there are testicular spermatozoa in NOA patients
before mTESE.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: RNA sequencing was performed on seminal plasma EVs 
from 6 normozoospermic men who underwent IVF due to female factor and 5
idiopathic NOA patients who failed to obtain testicular spermatozoa by mTESE and 
were diagnosed as having Sertoli cell-only syndrome by postoperative pathology. A
biomarker panel of lncRNAs was constructed and verified in 96 NOA patients who
underwent mTESE. Decision-making process was established based on the panel in
seminal plasma EVs from 45 normozoospermia samples, 43 oligozoospermia samples,
62 cryptozoospermia samples, 96 NOA samples.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: RNA sequencing was done to examine
altered profiles of EV lncRNAs in seminal plasma. Furthermore, a panel consisting
of EV lncRNAs was established and evaluated in training set and validation sets.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A panel consisting of nine differentially
expressed testis-specific lncRNAs, including LOC100505685, SPATA42, CCDC37-DT,
GABRG3-AS1, LOC440934, LOC101929088 (XR_927561.2), LOC101929088 (XR_001745218.1),
LINC00343 and LINC00301, was established in the training set and the AUC was
0.986. Furthermore, the AUC in the validation set was 0.960. Importantly, the
panel had a unique advantage when compared with models based on serum hormones
from the same group of NOA cases (AUC, 0.970 vs 0.723; 0.959 vs 0.687,
respectively). According to the panel of lncRNAs, a decision-making process was
established, that is when the score of an NOA case exceeds 0.532, sperm retrieval
surgery may be recommended.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In the future, the sample size needs to be
further expanded. Meanwhile, the regulatory functions and mechanism of lncRNAs in
spermatogenesis also need to be elucidated.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: When the score of our panel is below 0.532,
subjecting the NOA patients to ineffective surgical interventions may not be
recommended due to poor sperm retrieval rate.
