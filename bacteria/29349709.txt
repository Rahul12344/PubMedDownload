BACKGROUND: Statins can exert pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, vascular protective 
and anticoagulant effects, which in theory could improve the dysregulated host
response during sepsis. We aimed to determine the association between prior
statin use and host response characteristics in critically ill patients with
sepsis.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study in 1060 patients admitted
with sepsis to the mixed intensive care units (ICUs) of two hospitals in the
Netherlands between January 2011 and July 2013. Of these, 351 patients (33%) were
on statin therapy before admission. The host response was evaluated by measuring 
23 biomarkers providing insight into key pathways implicated in sepsis
pathogenesis and by analyzing whole-blood leukocyte transcriptomes in samples
obtained within 24 h after ICU admission. To account for indication bias, a
propensity score-matched cohort was created (N = 194 in both groups for protein
biomarkers and N = 95 in both groups for gene expression analysis).
RESULTS: Prior statin use was not associated with an altered mortality up to
90 days after admission (38.0 vs. 39.7% in the non-statin users in the
propensity-matched analysis). Statin use did not modify systemic inflammatory
responses, activation of the vascular endothelium or the coagulation system. The 
blood leukocyte genomic response, characterized by over-expression of genes
involved in inflammatory and innate immune signaling pathways as well as
under-expression of genes associated to T cell function, was not different
between patients with and without prior statin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is not associated with a modified host response in
sepsis patients on admission to the ICU.
