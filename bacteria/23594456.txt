σ(E)-dependent cell lysis has been proposed to eliminate damaged cells in the
stationary phase in Escherichia coli. In order to explore the relationship of
this process to long-term stationary phase existence, we considered that micA and
rybB could be important small regulatory RNA (sRNA) genes for σ(E)-dependent cell
lysis. A long-term stationary phase was observed at temperatures of <37°C, but
not >38°C, and was found even in an rpoS knock-out background. Strains with
disrupted micA or rybB were incapable of long-term stationary phase existence.
Both strains drastically lost survivability accompanied by a dramatic
accumulation of mutations. These findings allow us to speculate that
σ(E)-dependent cell lysis plays a key role in the establishment of the long-term 
stationary phase, presumably by eliminating damaged cells and thus preventing the
over-accumulation of mutations.
