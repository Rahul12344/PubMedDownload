Human babesiosis is caused by the apicomplexan parasite Babesia microti, which is
of major public health concern in the United States and elsewhere, resulting in
malaise and fatigue, followed by a fever and hemolytic anemia. In this paper we
focus on the characterization of a novel B. microti thrombospondin domain
(TSP1)-containing protein (BmP53) from the new annotation of the B. microti
genome (locus 'BmR1_04g09041'). This novel protein (BmP53) had a single TSP1 and 
a transmembrane domain, with a short cytoplasmic tail containing a sub-terminal
glutamine residue, but no signal peptide and Von Willebrand factor type A domains
(VWA), which are found in classical thrombospondin-related adhesive proteins
(TRAP). Co-localization assays of BmP53 and Babesia microti secreted antigen 1
(BmSA1) suggested that BmP53 might be a non-secretory membranous protein.
Molecular mimicry between the TSP1 domain from BmP53 and host platelets molecules
was indicated through different measures of sequence homology, phylogenetic
analysis, 3D structure and shared epitopes. Indeed, hamster isolated platelets
cross-reacted with mouse anti-BmP53-TSP1. Molecular mimicry are used to help
parasites to escape immune defenses, resulting in immune evasion or autoimmunity.
Furthermore, specific host reactivity was also detected against the TSP1-free
part of BmP53 in infected hamster sera. In conclusion, the TSP1 domain mimicry
might help in studying the mechanisms of parasite-induced thrombocytopenia, with 
the TSP1-free truncate of the protein representing a potential safe candidate for
future vaccine studies.
