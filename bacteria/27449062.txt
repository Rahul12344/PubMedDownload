BACKGROUND: The production of chemokines by tissue resident cells during
inflammation is considered one of the main mechanisms involved in the formation
of inflammatory infiltrates. Fibroblasts are the main resident cell type in
gingival and periodontal ligament tissues, and their ability to produce chemokine
stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1α) and its receptor CXCR4 under
stimulation by gram negative bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, commonly found
in periodontal infections was investigated.
METHODS: Western blots were used to assess SDF-1α and CXCR4 protein expression
levels in human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF-1) induced by Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) from P. gingivalis in the presence or absence of LY294002, a highly
selective inhibitor of PI-3K/Akt. RT-PCR and quantitative Real-time PCR was
performed using gingival mRNAs from periodontitis patients. Immunohistochemistry 
was performed to analyze the expression and subcellular localization of SDF-1α
and CXCR4, together with NF-kβ phosphorylation, in specimens from patients with
periodontitis and in an experimental rat periodontitis model.
RESULTS: We found that P. gingivalis LPS up-regulated SDF-1α and CXCR4 protein
levels and elevated phosphorylation of the SDF-1α-responsive NF-kβ and Akt at
24 h in HGF-1 cells. SDF-1α and CXCR4 mRNA and protein expression levels were
high in all patients with periodontitis. In the P. gingivalis-induced rat
experimental periodontitis model, SDF-1α and CXCR4 immunoreactivity was higher in
gingival and periodontal ligament tissues compared to the control.
CONCLUSION: Our data showed that PI-3K/Akt is an upstream participant in the P.
gingivalis LPS-mediated induction of SDF-1α. Taken together, these results
suggest that the chemokine SDF-1α and its receptor CXCR4 contribute to P.
gingivalis-induced periodontal inflammation.
