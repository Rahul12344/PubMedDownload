Mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage is intimately connected to ageing and
neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). A particular culprit in
this context is oxidative stress, which is a result of increased reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) due to hyperactive or dysfunctional mitochondria and/or reduced DNA
repair capacity. Base excision repair (BER) is the major pathway for repairing
oxidative damage events in chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA. Defects in BER have
been detected in ageing and neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial transcription factor
A (TFAM) plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA
integrity. The present study investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
in the genes encoding the BER components MutYH, OGG1, APE1, PolB and PolG and the
gene encoding mitochondrial TFAM in a cohort of 161 AD patients, 96 non-AD
patient controls (PC) and 192 healthy controls (HC). Notably, the minor allele
carriers of APE1 rs1130409 and the common allele carriers of TFAM rs1937 were
associated with reduced mini-mental state examination score in AD patients, PC
and HC, with no distinction of SNP frequencies in either of these sub-groups.
Collectively, the results suggest an association between DNA maintenance and
decline in cognitive function. These studies enlighten the normal brain aging
process and point to potential new biomarkers for cognitive function and
impairment.
