BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy is effective in selected patients with deep vein
thrombosis (DVT). Therefore, identification of a marker that reflects the age of 
thrombus is of particular concern. This pilot study aimed to identify a marker
that reflects the time after onset in human aspirated DVT.
METHODS: We histologically and immunohistochemically analyzed 16 aspirated
thrombi. The times from onset to aspiration ranged from 5 to 60 days (median of
13 days). Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and
antibodies for fibrin, glycophorin A, integrin α2bβ3, macrophage markers (CD68,
CD163, and CD206), CD34, and smooth muscle actin (SMA).
RESULTS: All thrombi were immunopositive for glycophorin A, fibrin, integrin
α2bβ3, CD68, CD163, and CD206, and contained granulocytes. Almost all of the
thrombi had small foci of CD34- or SMA-immunopositive areas. CD68- and
CD163-immunopositive cell numbers were positively correlated with the time after 
onset, while the glycophorin A-immunopositive area was negatively correlated with
the time after onset. In double immunohistochemistry, CD163-positive cells
existed predominantly among the CD68-immunopositive macrophage population.
CD163-positive macrophages were closely localized with glycophorin A, CD34, or
SMA-positive cell-rich areas.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CD163 macrophage and erythrocyte
contents could be markers for evaluation of the age of thrombus in DVT.
Additionally, CD163 macrophages might play a role in organization of the process 
of venous thrombus.
