The extraordinary homology between major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC
II) proteins across species from human to bony fish suggests that transcription
factors that regulate these proteins might be conserved as well. Deficiencies in 
four proteins that regulate MHC II genes in humans (RFX-B, RFX5, RFXAP, and
CIITA) cause an inherited immunodeficiency disorder known as the bare lymphocyte 
syndrome (BLS). To understand the structure and mechanism of function of the BLS 
transcription factors, we analyzed the evolutionary history of RFX-B, the factor 
deficient in the majority of patients with BLS. Sequence comparison and analysis 
of the RFX-B proteins showed that RFX-B and a closely related protein, ANKRA2,
are present in humans to bony fish and that specific domains are highly
conserved. In addition to sequence conservation, functional conservation exists, 
as mouse and Xenopus RFX-B orthologues, but not the paralogous protein ANKRA2,
were able to complement the MHC II deficiency in a BLS-patient-derived cell line 
deficient in RFX-B. The remarkable conservation of the RFX-B lineage attests to
the conservation of the regulation mechanism for this gene system and its
importance to precisely regulate MHC class II molecules in both the developing
and active immune response.
