Our understanding of porin regulation has revealed not only increasing complexity
in the regulatory mechanisms, but also that the porin repertoire is more
extensive than previously conceived. Initially, the OmpR response regulator was
described as the master regulator of porin genes, but many more regulators are
involved such as CpxR, PhoB, Lrp, Rob, MarA, SoxS, CadC, CRP, Fnr, ToxR, H-NS,
StpA, IHF, HU and LeuO. In addition to MicF, the first small RNA (sRNA) that was 
proposed to regulate porin expression, porins are post-transcriptionally
regulated by a variety of other sRNAs, namely, MicC, MicA, IpeX, RseX, InvR, CyaR
and RybB. Future challenges include the full integration of all the regulatory
circuitries. Whether quiescent porins are merely replacements of the major porins
or are part of novel metabolic programs has yet to be elucidated. The
comprehensive exploration of the environmental determinants that affect porin
gene expression should yield valuable new information about the functions of
these important proteins.
