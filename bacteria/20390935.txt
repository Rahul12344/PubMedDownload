Methanogenic granular sludge and wastewater fermented sludge were used as inocula
for batch tests of anaerobic bioremediation of chlorinated pesticide contaminated
soil. Results obtained for both types of biomass were similar: 80 to over 90% of 
gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH),
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane (methoxychlor) and
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) removed in 4-6 weeks.
Residual fractions of these pesticides persisted till the end of the 16-week
experiment. DDT was degraded through 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)ethane 
(DDD). Accumulation of this product corresponded stoichiometrically only to
34-53% of removed DDT, supposedly due to its further transformations, finally
resulting in formation of detected 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP). Addition of
0.5 mM Tween 80 nonionic surfactant resulted in about a twofold decrease of gamma
-HCH and methoxychlor residual concentrations, as well as considerably lower DDD 
accumulation (7-29%) and higher DBP production. However, 1.25 mM dose of this
surfactant applied together with granular sludge brought DDD levels back to that 
observed for treatments with the sludge alone, also impairing DBP formation.
