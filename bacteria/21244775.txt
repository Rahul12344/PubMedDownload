Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, the principal etiologic agents
of caries decay of teeth, are generally acquired in oral cavity at the moment of 
tooth eruption. However, as S. mutans has been detected in oral cavity of
predentate children, the eruption of teeth seems not to be a necessary
prerequisite, suggesting that this species may be not confined to dental plaque. 
Here, we evaluate the ability of S. mutans and S. sobrinus in planktonic and
biofilm lifestyle to adhere, invade and survive within human gingival fibroblast 
(HGF-1) cells. Planktonic and biofilm streptococci adhered and invaded host cells
to different extents, showing higher efficiencies of biofilm than planktonic
counterparts. Moreover, planktonic and biofilm streptococci showed the same
percentage of survival within host cells. Transmission electron and confocal
microscopy observations confirmed intracellular localization of planktonic and
biofilm bacteria. The adhesion, invasion and survival abilities within human oral
cells may be considered S. mutans and S. sobrinus virulence mechanisms to
colonize and persist in the oral cavity in the absence of tooth surface.
