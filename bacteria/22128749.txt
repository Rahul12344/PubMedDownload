Natural killer (NK) cells have distinctive functional capacities that are likely 
to contribute both to innate and adaptive immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and their ligands, i.e. human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules contribute partly in regulation of NK
cell activity. In this study, the impact of compound KIR/HLA genotype on
susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) has been evaluated in Iranian
individuals. A total of 107 TB patients and 100 matched healthy controls were
genotyped for 17 KIR genes and their three major HLA class I ligand groups (-C1, 
-C2 and -Bw4: -B Bw4(Ile80) , -B Bw4(Thr80) and -A Bw4) by a polymerase chain
reaction-sequence-specific primers assay. Various analyses including distribution
of KIR and HLA ligand genes and genotypes, frequency of inhibitory and activating
KIR+HLA combinations and compound genotype status regarding balance of inhibitory
and activating components showed no significant difference between patient and
control groups. These findings may suggest that compound KIR/HLA genotype has no 
major impact on limiting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.
