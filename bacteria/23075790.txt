A xylanase-producing thermophilic strain, Geobacillus sp. TC-W7, was isolated
from a hot spring in Yongtai (Fuzhou, China). Subsequently, the xylanase gene
that encoded 407 amino acids was cloned and expressed. The recombinant xylanase
was purified by GST affinity chromatography and exhibited maximum activity at 75 
degrees C and a pH of 8.2. The enzyme was active up to 95 degrees C and showed
activity over a wide pH range of 5.2 to 10.2. Additionally, the recombinant
xylanase showed high thermostability and pH stability. More than 85% of the
enzyme's activity was retained after incubation at 70 degrees C for 90 min at a
pH of 8.2. The activity of the recombinant xylanase was enhanced by treatment
with 10 mM enzyme inhibitors (DDT, Tween-20, 2-Me, or TritonX-100) and was
inhibited by EDTA or PMSF. Its functionality was stable in the presence of Li+,
Na+, and K+, but inhibited by Hg2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Fe3+, and Al3+.
The functionality of the crude xylanase had similar properties to the recombinant
xylanase except for when it was treated with Al2+ or Fe2+. The enzyme might be a 
promising candidate for various industrial applications such as the biofuel,
food, and paper and pulp industries.
