In mammalian cells, classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) is critical for
DNA double-strand break repair induced by ionizing radiation and during V(D)J
recombination in developing B and T lymphocytes. Recently, PAXX was identified as
a c-NHEJ core component. We report here that PAXX-deficient cells exhibit a
cellular phenotype uncharacteristic of a deficiency in c-NHEJ core components.
PAXX-deficient cells display normal sensitivity to radiomimetic drugs, are
proficient in transient V(D)J recombination assays, and do not shift toward
higher micro-homology usage in plasmid repair assays. Although PAXX-deficient
cells lack c-NHEJ phenotypes, PAXX forms a stable ternary complex with Ku bound
to DNA. Formation of this complex involves an interaction with Ku70 and requires 
a bare DNA extension for stability. Moreover, the relatively weak Ku-dependent
stimulation of LIG4/XRCC4 activity by PAXX is unmasked by XLF ablation. Thus,
PAXX plays an accessory role during c-NHEJ that is largely overlapped by XLF's
function.
