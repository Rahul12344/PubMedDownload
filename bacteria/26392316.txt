Recently, we have successfully obtained functional IPCs efficiently from
umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells by using hypoxia treatment.
In this study, we further elaborated that the improved function and viability of 
IPCs are the result of the interaction β cell development pathway and c-Met/HGF
axis induced by hypoxia. We found that hypoxia induced c-MET elevation is
efficiently initiated the early stage differentiation IPCs from MSCs, and HGF
improved the fully differentiation of IPCs by inducing the expression of NGN3.
This finding may contribute to understanding β cell development and the
development of stem cell therapy for diabetes.
