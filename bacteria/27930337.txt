Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) is defined as recurrent or persistent
infection of the skin, nails, and/or mucosae with commensal Candida species. The 
first genetic etiology of isolated CMC-autosomal recessive (AR) IL-17 receptor A 
(IL-17RA) deficiency-was reported in 2011, in a single patient. We report here 21
patients with complete AR IL-17RA deficiency, including this first patient. Each 
patient is homozygous for 1 of 12 different IL-17RA alleles, 8 of which create a 
premature stop codon upstream from the transmembrane domain and have been
predicted and/or shown to prevent expression of the receptor on the surface of
circulating leukocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Three other mutant alleles create 
a premature stop codon downstream from the transmembrane domain, one of which
encodes a surface-expressed receptor. Finally, the only known missense allele
(p.D387N) also encodes a surface-expressed receptor. All of the alleles tested
abolish cellular responses to IL-17A and -17F homodimers and heterodimers in
fibroblasts and to IL-17E/IL-25 in leukocytes. The patients are currently aged
from 2 to 35 y and originate from 12 unrelated kindreds. All had their first CMC 
episode by 6 mo of age. Fourteen patients presented various forms of
staphylococcal skin disease. Eight were also prone to various bacterial
infections of the respiratory tract. Human IL-17RA is, thus, essential for
mucocutaneous immunity to Candida and Staphylococcus, but otherwise largely
redundant. A diagnosis of AR IL-17RA deficiency should be considered in children 
or adults with CMC, cutaneous staphylococcal disease, or both, even if IL-17RA is
detected on the cell surface.
