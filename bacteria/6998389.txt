Radical peritoneal debridement for established peritonitis. The results of a
prospective randomized clinical trial.

Polk HC Jr, Fry DE.

A randomized, prospective comparison of radical peritoneal debridement and
standard surgical management of peritonitis disclosed no differences in terms of 
hospital mortality for the frequency of reoperation for abscess. Adjunctive
measures such as antibiotic therapy and peritoneal irrigation were identical
between the groups. The groups were demographically and clinically similar but
had a much lower incidence of intestinal obstruction than in the patients
originally reported by Hudspeth.
