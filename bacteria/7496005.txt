SETTING: Representative sample survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP)
for tuberculosis among private general practitioners (GPs) in 1993 in Korea,
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the KAP of general practitioners on the prevention and 
treatment of tuberculosis.
DESIGN: Questionnaire surveys were performed for 923 private general
practitioners through 29 health centres.
RESULTS: 49% of GPs considered that the Korean tuberculosis situation is not
serious. 54% were worried about infection from patients. 47% answered that BCG
vaccination causes untoward reactions with no or limited effectiveness. 47%
considered the National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) unfavourably. Over 50% did
not consider sputum examination essential in case finding/diagnosis, and 75% in
monitoring of treatment response. For initial treatment of active tuberculosis,
only 11% were prescribing the current Korean NTP's six-month standard regimen.
73% were giving currently non-recommendable regimens, and 16% unacceptably bad
regimens. However, this situation could be improved, as 80% of GPs expressed the 
wish to acquire knowledge.
CONCLUSION: Many misunderstandings were found in the field of transmission, BCG
vaccination and the performance of the NTP; sputum examinations were considerably
neglected in case finding/diagnosis and treatment monitoring. As for treatment,
89% were giving either non-recommendable regimens or bad regimens.
