OBJECTIVES: To investigate the processes associated with the excessive production
of collagen I in hereditary gingival fibromatosis (HGF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three HGF subjects and five controls were enrolled in the 
study. Histomorphological and immunohistological analyses were performed on
gingival tissues. The expression of heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), collagen I,
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) by gingival fibroblasts isolated from HGF and
controls was analysed using qRT-PCR, Western blotting and ELISA.
RESULTS: Considerable accumulation of fibrotic fibrils and increased synthesis of
HSP47 were noted in HGF gingival tissues. The synthesis of collagen I, HSP47,
TGF-β1, CTGF and TIMP-1 was significantly elevated in HGF gingival fibroblasts
compared with controls, while the production of MMP-1 was decreased.
CONCLUSIONS: We report that fibrosis in HGF gingival tissues is associated with
increased synthesis of HSP47. This finding was confirmed by an in vitro study,
where excessive production of collagen I was associated with increased synthesis 
of HSP47, TGF-β1 and CTGF by HGF gingival fibroblasts. Moreover, the shift in the
TIMP-1/MMP-1 ratio identifies increased synthesis of TIMP-1 as one of the
processes associated with collagen I overproduction in HGF fibroblasts.
