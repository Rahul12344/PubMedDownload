Small Hfq-dependent non-coding regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that alter mRNA stability 
and expression by pairing with target mRNAs have increasingly been shown to be
important in influencing the behaviour of bacteria. In Escherichia coli, flhD and
flhC, which encode the master regulator of flagellar synthesis, are
co-transcribed from a promoter that is regulated by multiple transcription
factors that respond to different environmental cues. Here, we show that the 5'
untranslated region (5' UTR) of the flhDC mRNA also serves as a hub to integrate 
additional environmental cues into the decision to make flagella. Four sRNAs,
ArcZ, OmrA, OmrB and OxyS, negatively regulated and one sRNA, McaS, positively
regulated motility and flhDC expression by base-pairing with the 5' UTR of this
mRNA. Another sRNA, MicA, positively regulated motility independent of regulation
of flhDC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the regulation of motility by the
ArcB/A two component system is in part due to its regulation of ArcZ. flhDC is
the first mRNA that has been shown to be both positively and negatively regulated
by direct pairing to sRNAs. Moreover, both positive regulation by McaS and
negative regulation by ArcZ require the same binding site in the flhDC mRNA.
