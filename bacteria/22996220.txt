Kudoa septempunctata, a myxosporean parasite, was recently identified as the
causative agent of food poisoning resulting from the consumption of raw olive
flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). A single blind inter-laboratory study,
involving 5 laboratories, was conducted to validate a quantitative real-time PCR 
assay for the detection of the parasite. We obtained relatively constant values
for log rDNA copies/g from these laboratory analyses (SD = 0.35-0.86), suggesting
the validity of the real-time PCR method for the detection of K. septempunctata
in P. olivaceus. Detection of K. septempunctata in muscle tissue samples
collected from both sides of the fish indicated that K. septempunctata infection 
spreads throughout the body of P. olivaceus. K. septempunctata infection in P.
olivaceus is thought to occur during the early stage of fish growth because a K. 
septempunctata gene was detected in 1 of 300 P. olivaceus fry tested. Feeds seem 
not to be sources of infection. To prevent food poisoning due to K.
septempunctata, the mechanism of infection and proliferation of K. septempunctata
in P. olivaceus should be elucidated, and other hosts of the parasite should be
identified. The sensitive real-time PCR method described here will be a useful
tool for resolving these issues.
