Chemokine CXCL8 plays a pivotal role in host immune response by recruiting
neutrophils to the infection site. CXCL8 exists as monomers and dimers, and
mediates recruitment by interacting with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and activating
CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors. How CXCL8 monomer and dimer interactions with both
receptors and GAGs mediate trafficking is poorly understood. In particular, both 
haptotactic (mediated by GAG-bound chemokine) and chemotactic (mediated by
soluble chemokine) gradients have been implicated, and whether it is the free or 
the GAG-bound CXCL8 monomer and/or dimer that activates the receptor remains
unknown. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we have now characterized the binding
of heparin-bound CXCL8 monomer and dimer to CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptor N-domains.
Our data provide compelling evidence that heparin-bound monomers and dimers are
unable to bind either of the receptors. Cellular assays also indicate that
heparin-bound CXCL8 is impaired for receptor activity. Considering dimer binds
GAGs with higher affinity, dimers will exist predominantly in the GAG-bound form 
and the monomer in the free form. We conclude that GAG interactions determine the
levels of free CXCL8, and that it is the free, and not GAG-bound, CXCL8 that
activates the receptors and mediates recruitment of blood neutrophils to the
infected tissue.
