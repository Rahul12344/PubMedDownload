We present an integrative genome-wide analysis that can be used to predict the
risk of progression from leukoplakia to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)
arising in the gingivobuccal complex (GBC). We find that the genomic and
transcriptomic profiles of leukoplakia resemble those observed in later stages of
OSCC and that several changes are associated with this progression, including
amplification of 8q24.3, deletion of 8p23.2, and dysregulation of DERL3, EIF5A2, 
ECT2, HOXC9, HOXC13, MAL, MFAP5 and NELL2. Comparing copy number profiles of
primary tumors with and without lymph-node metastasis, we identify alterations
associated with metastasis, including amplifications of 3p26.3, 8q24.21, 11q22.1,
11q22.3 and deletion of 8p23.2. Integrative analysis reveals several biomarkers
that have never or rarely been reported in previous OSCC studies, including
amplifications of 1p36.33 (attributable to MXRA8), 3q26.31 (EIF5A2), 9p24.1
(CD274), and 12q13.2 (HOXC9 and HOXC13). Additionally, we find that
amplifications of 1p36.33 and 11q22.1 are strongly correlated with poor clinical 
outcome. Overall, our findings delineate genomic changes that can be used in
treatment management for patients with potentially malignant leukoplakia and OSCC
patients with higher risk of lymph-node metastasis.
