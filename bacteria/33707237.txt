Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) cause severe autoimmune disease characterized 
by vascular pathologies and pregnancy complications. Here, we identify endosomal 
lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) presented by the CD1d-like endothelial protein C 
receptor (EPCR) as a pathogenic cell surface antigen recognized by aPLs for
induction of thrombosis and endosomal inflammatory signaling. The engagement of
aPLs with EPCR-LBPA expressed on innate immune cells sustains interferon- and
toll-like receptor 7-dependent B1a cell expansion and autoantibody production.
Specific pharmacological interruption of EPCR-LBPA signaling attenuates major
aPL-elicited pathologies and the development of autoimmunity in a mouse model of 
systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, aPLs recognize a single cell surface
lipid-protein receptor complex to perpetuate a self-amplifying autoimmune
signaling loop dependent on the cooperation with the innate immune complement and
coagulation pathways.
