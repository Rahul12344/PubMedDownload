RATIONALE: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) accounts for a major proportion of 
intensive care unit (ICU) admissions for respiratory failure and sepsis.
Diagnostic uncertainty complicates case management, which may delay appropriate
cause-specific treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To characterize the blood genomic response in patients with suspected
CAP and identify a candidate biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of CAP on ICU
admission.
METHODS: The study comprised two cohorts of consecutively enrolled patients
treated for suspected CAP on ICU admission. Patients were designated CAP (cases) 
and no-CAP patients (control subjects) by post hoc assessment. The first
(discovery) cohort (101 CAP and 33 no-CAP patients) was enrolled between January 
2011 and July 2012; the second (validation) cohort (70 CAP and 30 no-CAP
patients) between July 2012 and June 2013. Blood was collected within 24 hours of
ICU admission.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Blood microarray analysis of CAP and no-CAP
patients revealed shared and distinct gene expression patterns. A 78-gene
signature was defined for CAP, from which a FAIM3:PLAC8 gene expression ratio was
derived with area under curve of 0.845 (95% confidence interval, 0.764-0.917) and
positive and negative predictive values of 83% and 81%, respectively. Robustness 
of the FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio was ascertained by quantitative polymerase chain
reaction in the validation cohort. The FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio outperformed plasma
procalcitonin and IL-8 and IL-6 in discriminating between CAP and no-CAP
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CAP and no-CAP patients presented shared and distinct blood genomic 
responses. We propose the FAIM3:PLAC8 ratio as a candidate biomarker to assist in
the rapid diagnosis of CAP on ICU admission. Clinical trial registered with
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01905033).
