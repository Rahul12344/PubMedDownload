BACKGROUND: Up to now, immunisation regimens that have been assessed for
development of HIV vaccines have included purified envelope (Env) protein among
the boosting components of the regimen. We postulated that co-administration of
Env protein with either a DNA or NYVAC vector during priming would result in
early generation of antibody responses to the Env V1/V2 region, which are
important markers for effective protection against infection. We aimed to assess 
the safety and immunogenicity of a multivalent HIV vaccine including either DNA
or NYVAC vectors alone or in combination with Env glycoprotein (gp120) followed
by a co-delivered NYVAC and Env protein boost.
METHODS: We did a single-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1b trial 
at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (Lausanne, Switzerland). We
included healthy volunteers aged 18-50 years who were at low risk of HIV
infection. We randomly allocated participants using computer-generated random
numbers to one of four vaccination schedules or placebo (4:1), and within these
schedules participants were allocated either active treatment (T1, T2, T3, and
T4) or placebo (C1, C2, C3, and C4). T1 consisted of two doses of NYVAC vector
followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; T2 comprised four
doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; T3 was two doses of DNA vector
followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and gp120 Env protein; and T4 was two doses
of DNA vector and gp120 Env protein followed by two doses of NYVAC vector and
gp120 Env protein. Placebo injections were matched to the corresponding active
treatment group. Doses were administered by injection at months 0, 1, 3, and 6.
Primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine schedules. Immune 
response measures included cross-clade and epitope-specific binding antibodies,
neutralising antibodies, and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
measured 2 weeks after the month 1, 3, and 6 vaccinations. This trial is
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01799954.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 23, 2012, and April 18, 2013, 148 healthy adult volunteers 
were screened for the trial, of whom 96 participants were enrolled. 20
individuals were allocated to each active treatment group (groups T1-4; n=80) and
four were assigned to each placebo group (groups C1-4; n=16). Vaccines containing
the NYVAC vector (groups T1 and T2) were associated with more frequent severe
reactogenicity and more adverse events than were vaccines containing the DNA
vector (groups T3 and T4). The most frequent adverse events judged related to
study product were lymphadenopathy (n=9) and hypoaesthesia (n=2). Two
participants, one in the placebo group and one in the DNA-primed T3 group, had
serious adverse events that were judged unrelated to study product. One
participant in the T3 group died from cranial trauma after a motor vehicle
accident. Across the active treatment groups, IgG responses 2 weeks after the
6-month dose of vaccine were 74-95%. Early administration of gp120 Env protein
(groups T2 and T4) was associated with a substantially earlier and higher area
under the curve for gp120 Env binding, production of anti-V1/V2 and neutralising 
antibodies, and better antibody-response coverage over a period of 18 months,
compared with vaccination regimens that delayed administration of gp120 Env
protein until the 3-month vaccination (groups T1 and T3).
INTERPRETATION: Co-administration of gp120 Env protein components with DNA or
NYVAC vectors during priming led to early and potent induction of Env V1/V2 IgG
binding antibody responses. This immunisation approach should be considered for
induction of preventive antibodies in future HIV vaccine efficacy trials.
