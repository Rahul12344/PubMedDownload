BACKGROUND: High-pressure processing (HPP) is a commonly used technique in the
food industry to inactivate pathogens, including L. monocytogenes. It has been
shown that L. monocytogenes is able to recover from HPP injuries and can start to
grow again during long-term cold storage. To date, the gene expression profiling 
of L. monocytogenes during HPP damage recovery at cooling temperature has not
been studied. In order identify key genes that play a role in recovery of the
damage caused by HPP treatment, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) for two L. 
monocytogenes strains (barotolerant RO15 and barosensitive ScottA) at nine
selected time points (up to 48 h) after treatment with two pressure levels (200
and 400 MPa).
RESULTS: The results showed that a general stress response was activated by SigB 
after HPP treatment. In addition, the phosphotransferase system (PTS; mostly
fructose-, mannose-, galactitol-, cellobiose-, and ascorbate-specific PTS
systems), protein folding, and cobalamin biosynthesis were the most upregulated
genes during HPP damage recovery. We observed that cell-division-related genes
(divIC, dicIVA, ftsE, and ftsX) were downregulated. By contrast,
peptidoglycan-synthesis genes (murG, murC, and pbp2A) were upregulated. This
indicates that cell-wall repair occurs as a part of HPP damage recovery. We also 
observed that prophage genes, including anti-CRISPR genes, were induced by HPP.
Interestingly, a large amount of RNA-seq data (up to 85%) was mapped to Rli47,
which is a non-coding RNA that is upregulated after HPP. Thus, we predicted that 
Rli47 plays a role in HPP damage recovery in L. monocytogenes. Moreover,
gene-deletion experiments showed that amongst peptidoglycan biosynthesis genes,
pbp2A mutants are more sensitive to HPP.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified several genes and mechanisms that may play a role in
recovery from HPP damage of L. monocytogenes. Our study contributes to new
information on pathogen inactivation by HPP.
