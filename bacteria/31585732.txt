Increased angiogenesis is commonly observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
tissues in correlation with advanced disease. CLL cells express pro- and
anti-angiogenic genes and acquire a pro-angiogenic pattern upon interaction with 
the microenvironment. Because MMP-9 (a microenvironment component) plays
important roles in solid tumor angiogenesis, we have studied whether MMP-9
influenced the angiogenic pattern in CLL cells. Immunofluorescence analyses
confirmed the presence of MMP-9 in CLL tissues. MMP-9 interaction with CLL cells 
increased their MMP-9 expression and secretion into the medium. Accordingly, the 
conditioned media of MMP-9-primed CLL cells significantly enhanced endothelial
cell proliferation, compared to control cells. MMP-9 also increased VEGF and
decreased TSP-1 and Ang-2 expression, all at the gene and protein level, inducing
a pro-angiogenic pattern in CLL cells. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that
downregulation of the selected gene TSP-1 by MMP-9 involved α4β1 integrin, Src
kinase family activity and the STAT3 transcription factor. Regulation of
angiogenic genes is a novel contribution of MMP-9 to CLL pathology.
