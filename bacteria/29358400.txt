Gentamicin C complex from Micromonospora echinospora remains a globally important
antibiotic, and there is revived interest in the semisynthesis of analogs that
might show improved therapeutic properties. The complex consists of five
components differing in their methylation pattern at one or more sites in the
molecule. We show here, using specific gene deletion and chemical
complementation, that the gentamicin pathway up to the branch point is defined by
the selectivity of the methyltransferases GenN, GenD1, and GenK. Unexpectedly,
they comprise a methylation network in which early intermediates are ectopically 
modified. Using whole-genome sequence, we have also discovered the terminal
6'-N-methyltransfer required to produce gentamicin C2b from C1a or gentamicin C1 
from C2, an example of an essential biosynthetic enzyme being located not in the 
biosynthetic gene cluster but far removed on the chromosome. These findings fully
account for the methylation pattern in gentamicins and open the way to production
of individual gentamicins by fermentation, as starting materials for
semisynthesis.
