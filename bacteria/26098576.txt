LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) is a process wherein elements of autophagy
conjugate LC3 to phagosomal membranes. We characterize the molecular requirements
for LAP, and identify Rubicon as being required for LAP but not autophagy.
Rubicon is recruited to LAPosomes and is required for the activity of a Class III
PI(3)K complex containing UVRAG but lacking ATG14 and Ambra1. This allows for the
sustained localization of PtdIns(3)P, which is critical for recruitment of
downstream autophagic proteins and stabilization of the NOX2 complex to produce
reactive oxygen species. Both PtdIns(3)P and reactive oxygen species are required
for conjugation of LC3 to LAPosomes and subsequent association with LAMP1(+)
lysosomes. LAP is induced by engulfment of Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungal
pathogen that commonly afflicts immunocompromised hosts, and is required for its 
optimal clearance in vivo. Therefore, we have identified molecules that
distinguish LAP from canonical autophagy, thereby elucidating the importance of
LAP in response to A. fumigatus infection.
