Several composite markers have been proposed for risk assessment in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, choice of parameters and score
complexity restrict clinical applicability. Our aim was to provide and validate a
simplified COPD risk index independent of lung function.The PROMISE study (n=530)
was used to develop a novel prognostic index. Index performance was assessed
regarding 2-year COPD-related mortality and all-cause mortality. External
validity was tested in stable and exacerbated COPD patients in the ProCOLD,
COCOMICS and COMIC cohorts (total n=2988).Using a mixed clinical and statistical 
approach, body mass index (B), severe acute exacerbations of COPD frequency (AE),
modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea severity (D) and copeptin (C) were
identified as the most suitable simplified marker combination. 0, 1 or 2 points
were assigned to each parameter and totalled to B-AE-D or B-AE-D-C. It was
observed that B-AE-D and B-AE-D-C were at least as good as BODE (body mass index,
airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise capacity), ADO (age, dyspnoea, airflow
obstruction) and DOSE (dyspnoea, obstruction, smoking, exacerbation) indices for 
predicting 2-year all-cause mortality (c-statistic: 0.74, 0.77, 0.69, 0.72 and
0.63, respectively; Hosmer-Lemeshow test all p>0.05). Both indices were COPD
specific (c-statistic for predicting COPD-related 2-year mortality: 0.87 and
0.89, respectively). External validation of B-AE-D was performed in COCOMICS and 
COMIC (c-statistic for 1-year all-cause mortality: 0.68 and 0.74; c-statistic for
2-year all-cause mortality: 0.65 and 0.67; Hosmer-Lemeshow test all p>0.05).The
B-AE-D index, plus copeptin if available, allows a simple and accurate assessment
of COPD-related risk.
