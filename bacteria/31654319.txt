Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia worldwide with
10-30% prevalence in aging population and a high socioeconomic impact. Because AD
definitive diagnostic requires post-mortem verification, new approaches to study 
the disease are necessary. Here, we analyze the humoral immune response in AD to 
survey whether APP+1 or UBB+1 frameshift proteins, produced as a consequence of
the "molecular misreading" alteration in AD occurring in the APP (amyloid
precursor protein) and UBB (ubiquitin-B protein) proteins' mRNA, elicit the
production of autoantibodies specific of AD. To this end, APP+1 and UBB+1
peptides were expressed in bacteria as 6xHisHalo fusion proteins and after
purification to homogeneity their seroreactivity was analyzed using 81 individual
sera from AD patients and 43 individual sera from healthy individuals by
luminescence beads immunoassay. We found that as a result of the molecular
misreading, APP+1 and UBB+1 frameshift peptides produced a humoral immune
response in AD patients, whose autoantibody levels are significantly higher in
comparison with healthy controls. Their combination with a previously reported
panel of four autoantigens specific of AD (ANTXR1, OR8J1, PYGB, and NUPR1)
increased their diagnostic ability assessed by receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curves up to an area under the curve (AUC) of 73.5%. Collectively, our
results demonstrate that APP+1 and UBB+1 frameshift proteins, non-previously
described as AD-specific autoantigens, elicit the production of autoantibodies
which might be useful as blood-based biomarkers to aid in the detection of the
disease.
