The emergence of bacterial resistance against life-saving medicines has forced
the scientific community and pharmaceutical industry to take actions in the quest
for novel antibacterials. These should not only overcome the existing bacterial
resistance but also provide at least interim effective protection against
emerging bacterial infections. Research into DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV
inhibitors has become a particular focus, with the description of a new class of 
bacterial topoisomerase type II inhibitors known as "novel bacterial
topoisomerase inhibitors", NBTIs. Elucidation of the key structural modifications
incorporated into these inhibitors and the impact these can have on their general
physicochemical properties are detailed in this review. This defines novel
bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors with promising antibacterial activities and
potencies, which thus represent one potential example of the future "drugs for
bad bugs", as identified by the World Health Organization.
