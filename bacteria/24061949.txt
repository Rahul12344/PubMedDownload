Design and Synthesis of New Peptidomimetics as Potential Inhibitors of MurE.

Zivec M, Turk S, Blanot D, Gobec S.

With the continuing emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria, there
is an urgent need for the development of new antimicrobial agents. One possible
source of new antibacterial targets is the biosynthesis of the bacterial
cell-wall peptidoglycan. The assembly of the peptide stem is carried out by four 
essential enzymes, known as the Mur ligases (MurC, D, E and F). We have designed 
and synthesised a focused library of compounds as potential inhibitors of
UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamate:L-lysine ligase (MurE) from
Staphylococcus aureus. This was achieved using two approaches: (i) synthesis of
transition-state analogues based on the methyleneamino core; and (ii) synthesis
of MurE reaction product analogues. Two methyleneamino-based compounds are
identified as initial hits for inhibitors of MurE.
