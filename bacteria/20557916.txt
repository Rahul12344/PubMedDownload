The first isolation of Vibrio tapetis from Wedge sole (Dicologoglossa cuneata) is
reported. The bacterium was recovered from ulcers of ailing cultured fish, from
two different outbreaks occurred in spring 2005. The four isolates found (a200,
a201, a204 and a255) were biochemically, genetically and serologically
characterized and diagnosis was confirmed by PCR V. tapetis specific primers and 
multilocus sequencing analysis (MLSA). The isolates constituted a homogeneous
phenotypic and genotypic group, being distinct to the already serological and
genetic groups defined within the species. A virulence evaluation of the isolate 
a255 was also carried out; however this strain was unable to induce disease in
fry and juvenile Wedge sole.
