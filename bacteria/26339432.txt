A rare case is presented of a 62-year-old man with primary isolated cryptococcal 
femoral osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed osteolytic
destruction of his left femur. Biopsy was performed firstly. Under microscope,
the lesion was compose of numerous large mononuclear cells, scattered
multinucleated giant cells, a few lymphocytes and neutrophils, necrosis with
serious artificial deformation. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), only CD31 and CD68
were positive, while CK, CK8/18, EMA, P63, CK7, CK20, PSAP, PSA, CD34 negative.
It was considered a low grade vascularsarcoma, but not confirmed. Then the
operation was done. Surgical specimen showed a lot of red-sphere materials in
most cells cytoplasm. The Gomorra methenamine silver staining and PAS revealed
the mucopolysaccharide-containing capsule of the Cryptococcus. Laboratory culture
of lesion liquid grew a kind of yeast at 37Â°C. Cryptococcal femoral osteomyelitis
was diagnosed at last. The patient is good now after the thorough debridement and
anti-fungal treatment.
