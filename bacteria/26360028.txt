The Rab GTPases are master regulators of endosomal trafficking in eukaryotic
cells. Among them, Rab8 plays an important role in tubulovesicular trafficking
from the trans-Golgi network and recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane. Rab8
is activated by its guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Rabin8. In order to
understand the molecular mechanisms that control endosomal recycling to the
plasma membrane, it is pivotal to understand how Rabin8 is regulated in cells.
Recently, biochemical and cell biological studies have identified several
mechanisms for Rabin8 activation, which involves the relief of the intramolecular
autoinhibition of Rabin8. Here we describe biochemical methods that we have used 
recently to study the activation of Rabin8.
