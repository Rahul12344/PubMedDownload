Impaired adipogenesis plays an important role in the development of
obesity-associated insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adipose tissue
inflammation is a crucial mediator of this process. GATA-3 plays important roles 
in adipogenesis and inflammation. The aim of this study is to investigate the
impact of GATA-3 suppression on improving adipogenesis, lowering inflammation and
reversing insulin resistance. GATA-3 levels were measured in subcutaneous (SC)
and omental (OM) adipose tissues obtained from insulin sensitive (IS) and insulin
resistant (IR) obese individuals during weight reduction surgeries. The effect of
GATA-3 suppression on adipogenesis, expression of inflammatory cytokines and
insulin resistance biomarkers was performed in 3T3L-1 mouse preadipocytes via
transfection with GATA-3-specific DNAzyme. GATA-3 expression was higher in OM
compared to SC adipose tissues and in stromal vascular fraction-derived
differentiating preadipocytes from IR obese individuals compared to their IS
counterparts. Suppression of GATA-3 expression in 3T3L-1 mouse preadipocytes with
GATA-3 specific inhibitor reversed 4-hydroxynonenal-induced impaired adipogenesis
and triggered changes in the expression of insulin signaling-related genes.
GATA-3 inhibition also modulated the expression of IL-6 and IL-10 and lowered the
expression of insulin resistance biomarkers (PAI-1 and resistin) and insulin
resistance phosphoproteins (p-BAD, p-PTEN and p-GSK3β). Inhibiting GATA-3
improves adipocytes differentiation, modulates the secretion of inflammatory
cytokines and improves insulin sensitivity in insulin resistant cells.
Suppression of GATA-3 could be a promising tool to improve adipogenesis, restore 
insulin sensitivity and lower obesity-associated inflammation in insulin
resistant individuals.
