Bacterial cultures of cloaca swabs from 86 captivity kept psittacidaes revealed
17 Escherichia coli bearing birds sharing strains which, on the basis of
enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) PCR analysis, proved to be
genetically similar. Further, triplex PCR specific for the genetic markers chuA, 
yjaA, and TSPE4.C2 was used to assign the strains to the E. coli reference
collection (EcoR) B2 group. One strain of each, from the enteropathogenic (EPEC),
enteroaggregative (EAEC) and Shiga toxin (STEC) E. coli pathovars were found
among these isolates.
