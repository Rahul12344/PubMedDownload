The results of two kinetic studies examining soft tissue, cartilage and bone
after uptake of oral ofloxacin [administered as 200 mg twice daily (study I/nose)
or 400 mg once daily (study II/ear)] show that antibiotic concentrations lie
within the therapeutic range. Findings demonstrate that 400 mg ofloxacin daily is
a compliance-enhancing and effective approach to the treatment of ENT-related
infections, in particular those caused by problem organisms such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.
