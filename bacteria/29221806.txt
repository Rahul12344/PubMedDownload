The use of engineered nucleases combined with a homologous DNA donor template can
result in targeted gene correction of the sickle cell disease mutation in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, because of the high homology
between the adjacent human β- and δ-globin genes, off-target cleavage is observed
at δ-globin when using some endonucleases targeted to the sickle mutation in
β-globin. Introduction of multiple double-stranded breaks by endonucleases has
the potential to induce intergenic alterations. Using a novel droplet digital PCR
assay and high-throughput sequencing, we characterized the frequency of
rearrangements between the β- and δ-globin paralogs when delivering these
nucleases. Pooled CD34+ cells and colony-forming units from sickle bone marrow
were treated with nuclease only or including a donor template and then analyzed
for potential gene rearrangements. It was observed that, in pooled CD34+ cells
and colony-forming units, the intergenic β-δ-globin deletion was the most
frequent rearrangement, followed by inversion of the intergenic fragment, with
the inter-chromosomal translocation as the least frequent. No rearrangements were
observed when endonuclease activity was restricted to on-target β-globin
cleavage. These findings demonstrate the need to develop site-specific
endonucleases with high specificity to avoid unwanted gene alterations.
