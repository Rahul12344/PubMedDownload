BACKGROUND: New semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotics generally use chemical 
modifications to avoid inactivity from pathogens. One of the most used
modifications is 3',4'-di-deoxygenation, which imitates the structure of
gentamicin. However, the mechanism of di-deoxygenation has not been clearly
elucidated.
RESULTS: Here, we report that the bifunctional enzyme, GenB4, catalyzes the last 
step of gentamicin 3',4'-di-deoxygenation via reduction and transamination
activities. Following disruption of genB4 in wild-type M. echinospora, its
products accumulated in 6'-deamino-6'-oxoverdamicin (1), verdamicin C2a (2), and 
its epimer, verdamicin C2 (3). Following disruption of genB4 in M. echinospora
Î”genK, its products accumulated in sisomicin (4) and 6'-N-methylsisomicin (5,
G-52). Following in vitro catalytic reactions, GenB4 transformed sisomicin (4) to
gentamicin C1a (9) and transformed verdamicin C2a (2) and its epimer, verdamicin 
C2 (3), to gentamicin C2a (11) and gentamicin C2 (12), respectively.
CONCLUSION: This finding indicated that in addition to its transamination
activity, GenB4 exhibits specific 4',5' double-bond reducing activity and is
responsible for the last step of gentamicin 3',4'-di-deoxygenation. Taken
together, we propose three new intermediates that may refine and supplement the
specific biosynthetic pathway of gentamicin C components and lay the foundation
for the complete elucidation of di-deoxygenation mechanisms.
