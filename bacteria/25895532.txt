Clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) is the
earliest clinically evident phase of the disease, which may provide valuable
insight into the molecular mechanisms of the initiation of the autoimmune
response in MS. Our results introduce IL-11 as a new cytokine that plays a role
in the autoimmune response in the early phase of the disease. IL-11 is the
highest upregulated cytokine in the sera and cerebrospinal fluid from CIS
patients, which is also increased in patients with clinically definitive
relapsing-remitting MS in comparison with healthy control subjects. Serum IL-11
levels are significantly increased during clinical exacerbations in comparison
with remissions in the same patients. CD4(+) cells represent a predominant cell
source of IL-11 in the peripheral circulation, and the percentage of
IL-11(+)CD4(+) cells is significantly increased in CIS patients in comparison
with healthy control subjects. Furthermore, we have identified IL-11 as a new
Th17-promoting cytokine, because it induces a differentiation of naive CD4(+) T
cells into Th17 cells, as well as expansion of Th17 memory cells. Because the
Th17 cytokines IL-17F, IL-21 and TNF-α, and TGF-β induce differentiation of naive
cells in the IL-11-secreting CD4(+) cells, we propose that cross-talk between
IL-11(+)CD4(+) and Th17 cells may play a role in the inflammatory response in
relapsing-remitting MS.
