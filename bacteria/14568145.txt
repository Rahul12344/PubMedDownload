The genome sequence of Lactococcus lactis IL1403 revealed the presence of a
putative peptide-binding protein-dependent ABC-transporter (Dpp). The genes for
two peptide-binding proteins (dppA and dppP) precede the membrane components,
which include two transmembrane protein genes (dppB and dppC) and two ATP-binding
protein genes (dppD and dppF). In this work, the gene specifying the second
peptide-binding protein (DppP) was cloned under the control of the nisin
promoter. The protein fused to a carboxyl-terminal histidine tag (DppP-His(6))
was purified and its binding properties were determined by monitoring the
intrinsic fluorescence changes observed upon ligand binding. The major features
of peptide binding to DppP-His(6) include: (i) a requirement for a free
N-terminal alpha-amino group in the ligand; (ii) a high affinity for di-, tri-
and tetra-peptides; (iii) affinity constants for peptide binding independent of
pH; and (iv) a high affinity for D-isomer-containing peptides. Remarkably, the
features (ii), (iii) and (iv) differ from those previously reported for
DppA-His(6), suggesting that DppP-His(6) is a more versatile peptide-binding
protein that could have additional functions.
