Mercury(II) binding to s4U in E. coli tRNA(Val).

Sunshine HR, Lippard SJ.

The accessibility of the s(4)U base in native tRNA(Val) from E.coli was monitored
by studying the binding of various mercurials. The relative binding order
HgBr(2)[unk]HgCl(2)>>CH(3)HgOAc[unk]CH(3)HgCl[unk]PCMB parallels approximately
the steric requirements of linear HgX(2) or RHgX compounds for S(N)2 displacement
by sulfur, although other factors are operative. Para-chloromercuri-benzoate
(PCMB) does not bind the thiolated nucleotide unless the tertiary structure of
the tRNA is opened up by removal of Mg(2+) ions and heating to 40 degrees . Under
these conditions, equilibrium dialysis measurements using (14)C-labeled PCMB
showed one binding site (n = 0.93) with an association constant, K(1), of 9 x
10(4)M(-1).
