The strategies against H. pylori infection have been developed very fast. Since
the efficacy of mono-therapy (one antimicrobial drug) and dual-therapy
(proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) + one antimicrobial drug) were not good, and the
safety of classical triple therapy (bismuth + two antimicrobial drugs) was bad,
new triple-therapy consisted with PPI + two antimicrobial drugs is considered as 
a standard regimen of the treatment of H. pylori infection. However there are
several questions about this new strategy which we have to answer. The first
question is how can we diagnose the cure of H. pylori infection and when we
should do it? The second one is which statistical method should we choose for
evaluating the success rate? The third one is which drug should we use and how
long should the patient continuing to have the drug? A lot of scientific research
are need to clarify these questions.
