BACKGROUND: Mammary myofibroblastoma is a rare and benign neoplasm of the breast 
stroma, showing features of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. It has also been
noted to exhibit smooth muscle cell characteristics.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and pathological
features of mammary myofibroblastoma reported at our institution.
METHODS: Cases of mammary myofibroblastoma reported in our laboratory were
retrieved by electronic search. H&E slides were reviewed and clinico-pathologic
features were noted. Immunohistochemistery was performed by Envision method. Only
CD34 and CKAE1/AE3 were performed in all 6 cases. ASMA, desmin and S-100 were
performed in 5, 4 and 2 cases, respectively. Vimentin and Bcl-2 were performed in
one case.
RESULTS: A total of 6 cases were identified. Five were female and one was male.
The mean age of patients was 45.5 years. The mean size of tumors was 7.7 cm in
the largest dimension. Histologically, four cases showed clusters of uniform
bipolar spindle shaped cells separated by broad bands of hyalinized collagen.
Mitotic figures ranged from none to 3 mitoses/10 HPFs. One case showed combined
features of cellular and fibrous areas. Another case was epithelioid-cell type.
On immunohistochemistry, CD34 stain was positive in 5/6 cases, ASMA in 3/5 cases,
desmin in 2/4 cases, S-100 in none and vimentin and Bcl-2 in 1/6 cases. None of
the cases stained positive for CKAE1/AE3.
CONCLUSIONS: Due to the varying degree of fibro-myofibroblastic differentiation, 
myofibroblastoma shows multiple morphologies and several intratumoral and
intertumoral types. It is essential to distinguish each variant from the other to
avoid inaccurate diagnosis of other benign or malignant breast conditions,
becoming a noteworthy diagnostic dilemma for histopathologists.
