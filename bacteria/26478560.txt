Cytochromes P450 catalyze a variety of synthetically useful reactions. However,
it is difficult to determine their physiological or artificial functions when a
plethora of orphan P450 systems are present in a genome. CYP260A1 from Sorangium 
cellulosum So ce56 is a new member among the 21 available P450s in the strain. To
identify putative substrates for CYP260A1 we used high-throughput screening of a 
compound library (ca. 17,000 ligands). Structural analogues of the type I hits
were searched for biotechnologically relevant compounds, and this led us to
select C-19 steroids as potential substrates. We identified efficient surrogate
redox partners for CYP260A1, and an Escherichia coli-based whole-cell biocatalyst
system was developed to convert testosterone, androstenedione, and their
derivatives methyltestosterone and 11-oxoandrostenedione. A detailed (1) H and
(13) C NMR characterization of the product(s) from C-19 steroids revealed that
CYP260A1 is the very first 1α-steroid hydroxylase.
