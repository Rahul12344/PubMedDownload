RATIONALE: Sepsis can be complicated by secondary infections. We explored the
possibility that patients with sepsis developing a secondary infection while in
the intensive care unit (ICU) display sustained inflammatory, vascular, and
procoagulant responses.
OBJECTIVES: To compare systemic proinflammatory host responses in patients with
sepsis who acquire a new infection with those who do not.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with sepsis with a length of ICU stay greater than 
48 hours were prospectively analyzed for the development of ICU-acquired
infections. Twenty host response biomarkers reflective of key pathways implicated
in sepsis pathogenesis were measured during the first 4 days after ICU admission 
and at the day of an ICU-acquired infection or noninfectious complication.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,237 admissions for sepsis (1,089 patients),
178 (14.4%) admissions were complicated by ICU-acquired infections (at Day 10
[6-13], median with interquartile range). Patients who developed a secondary
infection showed higher disease severity scores and higher mortality up to 1 year
than those who did not. Analyses of biomarkers in patients who later went on to
develop secondary infections revealed a more dysregulated host response during
the first 4 days after admission, as reflected by enhanced inflammation, stronger
endothelial cell activation, a more disturbed vascular integrity, and evidence
for enhanced coagulation activation. Host response reactions were similar at the 
time of ICU-acquired infectious or noninfectious complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with sepsis who developed an ICU-acquired infection showed 
a more dysregulated proinflammatory and vascular host response during the first 4
days of ICU admission than those who did not develop a secondary infection.
