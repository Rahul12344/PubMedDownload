Natural and synthetic phenolic compounds were evaluated against oral bacteria. A 
quantitative structure-active relationship approach was applied to the germ-kill 
activity for a range of phenolic compounds. The lipophilicity and steric effects 
were found to be two key factors in determining germ-kill activity. The optimum
lipophilicity, measured by the logarithm of the octanol/water partition
coefficient, or log P, was found to be 5.5 for Fusobacterium nucleatum , a
Gram-negative type of oral bacteria that causes bad breath. The optimum log P was
found to be 7.9 for Streptococcus mutans , a Gram-positive type of oral bacteria 
that causes tooth decay. The steric effect of substituents ortho to the phenolic 
group was found to be critical in reducing antibacterial activity despite having 
increased lipid solubility approaching the optimum lipophilicity value. The
antibacterial activity of phenolic compounds is likely exerted by multiple
functions, primarily comes from its ability to act as a nonionic surface-active
agent therefore disrupting the lipid-protein interface.
