OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to verify the antibacterial performance 
and cell proliferation activity of zirconium (Zr)-carbon (C)-nitride (N) coatings
on commercially pure titanium (Ti) with different C contents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reactive nitrogen gas (N(2)) with and without acetylene
(C(2)H(2)) was activated by Zr plasma in a cathodic-arc evaporation system to
deposit either a zirconium nitride (ZrN) or a Zr-C-N coating onto Ti plates. The 
bacterial activity of the coatings was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus
with the aid of SYTO9 nucleic acid staining and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). Cell compatibility, mRNA expression, and morphology related to human
gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on the coated samples were also determined by using
the MTT assay, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and SEM.
RESULTS: The Zr-C-N coating with the highest C content (21.7 at%) exhibited the
lowest bacterial preservation (P<0.001). Biological responses including
proliferation, gene expression, and attachment of HGF cells to ZrN and Zr-C-N
coatings were comparable to those of the uncoated Ti plate.
CONCLUSIONS: High-C-content Zr-C-N coatings not only provide short-term
antibacterial activity against S. aureus but are also biocompatible with HGF
cells.
