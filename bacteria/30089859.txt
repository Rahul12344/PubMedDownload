Denmark, a tuberculosis low burden country, still experiences significant active 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission, especially with one specific
genotype named Cluster 2/1112-15 (C2), the most prevalent lineage in Scandinavia.
In addition to environmental factors, antibiotic resistance, and human genetics, 
there is increasing evidence that Mtb strain variation plays a role for the
outcome of infection and disease. In this study, we explore the reasons for the
success of the C2 genotype by analysing strain specific polymorphisms identified 
through whole genome sequencing of all C2 isolates identified in Denmark between 
1992 and 2014 (n = 952), and the demographic distribution of C2. Of 234
non-synonymous (NS) monomorphic SNPs found in C2 in comparison with Mtb reference
strain H37Rv, 23 were in genes previously reported to be involved in Mtb
virulence. Of these 23 SNPs, three were specific for C2 including a NS mutation
in a gene associated with hyper-virulence. We show that the genotype is readily
transmitted to different ethnicities and is also found outside Denmark. Our data 
suggest that strain specific virulence factor variations are important for the
success of the C2 genotype. These factors, likely in combination with poor TB
control, seem to be the main drivers of C2 success.
