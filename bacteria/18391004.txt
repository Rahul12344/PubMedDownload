Neisseria gonorrhoeae expressing type IV pili (Tfp) activates extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and induces a cytoprotective state in the
epithelial cell in a manner that is enhanced by pilT. As the ERK signaling
pathway is well-known for its role in cytoprotection and cell survival, we tested
the hypothesis that ERK is involved in producing this cytoprotective effect.
Inhibiting ERK activation prior to infection attenuated the ability of these
bacteria to induce cytoprotection. Activated ERK specifically targeted two
proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins, Bim and Bad, for
downregulation at the protein level. Bim downregulation occurred through the
proteasome. ERK, in addition, inactivated Bad by triggering its phosphorylation
at Ser112. Finally, reducing the level of either Bad or Bim alone by small
interfering RNA was sufficient to protect uninfected cells from
staurosporine-induced apoptosis. We conclude that Tfp-induced cytoprotection is
due in part to ERK-dependent modification and/or downregulation of proapoptotic
proteins Bad and Bim.
