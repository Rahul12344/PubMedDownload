In 2015, Clostridium difficile testing rates among 30 US community,
multispecialty, and cancer hospitals were 14.0, 16.3, and 33.9/1,000
patient-days, respectively. Pooled hospital onset rates were 0.56, 0.84, and
1.57/1,000 patient-days, respectively. Higher testing rates may artificially
inflate reported rates of C. difficile infection. C. difficile surveillance
should consider testing frequency.
