Cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) mediates gene expression in 
response to cAMP stimulation. The transcriptional activity of CREB depends on
both the phosphorylation of Ser133 and the recruitment of cofactor for assembly
of transcriptional complex. Extensive Ser133 phosphorylation of CREB was induced 
during T cell activation. This phosphorylation event is essential for IL-2 gene
expression. However, phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 was not sufficient for
transcriptional activity by CREB. The presence of a second signal from CD28, a
potent costimulatory molecule on T cells, stimulated CREB-mediated gene
expression. CD28, an effective costimulator of T cell activation and IL-2 gene
expression, is shown to induce CREB activation in the presence of anti-CD3 or
O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. These two signals together stimulated a
CRE-dependent reporter gene, the proliferating cell nuclear Ag promoter, and
transactivation by the GAL4-CREB fusion protein. Thus optimal induction of CREB, 
similar to the full activation of T lymphocytes, may be mediated by two distinct 
signal transductions. Using the specific kinase inhibitor, one of the two
pathways appeared to involve mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase but not
protein kinase C, protein kinase A, or p70 S6 kinase.
