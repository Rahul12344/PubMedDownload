BACKGROUND: Spondylitis in the upper cervical spine can have an insidious onset, 
with symptoms mimicking low-grade infections or common musculoskeletal disorders.
Some patients have neurological symptoms, and if untreated, the outcome may be
fatal.
CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her fifties had general malaise, weight loss and
neck pain over 6-8 weeks. Her sedimentation rate was elevated, and she developed 
bulbar symptoms. Biopsy and culture samples were harvested endoscopically from
the prevertebral area in the C1-C2 region, and confirmed our preliminary
diagnosis of localised infection. She was treated with high-dose antibiotics and 
rigid collar immobilisation until stability of the cervical spine was
ascertained.
INTERPRETATION: It is difficult to make a differential diagnosis between
spondylitis, rheumatoid inflammation and malignancy in the upper cervical spine. 
Adequate histologic and bacterial culture samples must if possible be obtained
from the prevertebral area. This is best achieved transnasally or transorally,
under endoscopic and radiological guidance. The neck must be stabilised and
patients must have long-term antibiotic treatment followed by permanent neck
fixation if indicated.
