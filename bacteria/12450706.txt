We compared the hypothetical effects of the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal
vaccine with new vaccines on preventing invasive and noninvasive pneumococcal
disease in persons >or=65 years. We estimated how much disease would occur if no 
polysaccharide vaccine were in use and used this baseline to compare the
polysaccharide, a 7-valent conjugate vaccine, and hypothetical common antigen
vaccine. The polysaccharide, conjugate, and common antigen vaccines prevented
10.6, 10.7, and 17.7% of invasive disease and 4.3, 5.6, and 10.0% of pneumonia,
respectively. Superior effectiveness of new vaccines was dependent upon a
presumed longer duration of protection than the 23V-PPV and effectiveness against
noninvasive pneumonia. Our results suggest that new vaccines could improve
disease prevention.
