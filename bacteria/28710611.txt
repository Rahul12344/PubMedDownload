PURPOSE: Bacterial infections are a factor for morbidity in patients with acute
appendicitis (AA). The spreading of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria is a
significant problem in surgery, and the most relevant MDR pathogens are
summarized as Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococci (ESKAPE)
bacteria. Data regarding the species and distribution of bacteria in AA are
available, but information about the resistances and their relevance is
deficient.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed microbiological swabs of
patients with AA. The outcome parameters of patients after laparoscopic
appendectomy were analyzed against microbiological results, including antibiotic 
resistance testing. Positive swabs were compared with bacteria cultivated after
alternative abdominal emergency surgery (AES).
RESULTS: In total, 584 patients with AA were included and had a mean age of
35.5 years. In 216 patients (36.9%), a swab was taken, and in 128 (59.3%) swabs, 
bacteria could be cultivated. The most frequent organisms were Escherichia coli, 
Bacteroides species, and Pseudomonas. In 9.4% of the positive AA swabs, MDR germs
were cultivated, and all of them were ESKAPE pathogens. Patients with MDR
bacteria in AA suffered more infectious complications (p = 0.006) and needed
longer hospitalizations (p < 0.009). In AES, aside from appendicitis, a different
spectrum containing more MDR bacteria was cultivated (5.9 vs. 20.9%; p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although they occur less frequently in appendectomy compared to
emergency surgeries for other abdominal diseases, MDR bacteria are traceable in
this common disease and contribute to additional morbidity.
