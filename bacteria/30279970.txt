Colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide with high
mortality. Distant metastasis and relapse are major causes of patient death.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a critical role in the metastasis and relapse of
colorectal cancer. CSCs are a subpopulation of cancer cells with unique
properties of self-renewal, infinite division and multi-directional
differentiation potential. Colorectal CSCs are defined with a group of cell
surface markers, such as CD44, CD133, CD24, EpCAM, LGR5 and ALDH. They are highly
tumorigenic, chemoresistant and radioresistant and thus are critical in the
metastasis and recurrence of colorectal cancer and disease-free survival. This
review article updates the colorectal CSCs with a focus on their role in tumor
initiation, progression, drug resistance and tumor relapse.
