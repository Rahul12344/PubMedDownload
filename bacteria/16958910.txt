The aim of this work was to relate depth profiles of prokaryotic community
composition with geochemical processes in the deep subseafloor biosphere at two
shallow-water sites on the Peru Margin in the Pacific Ocean (ODP Leg 201, sites
1228 and 1229). Principal component analysis of denaturing gradient gel
electrophoresis banding patterns of deep-sediment Bacteria, Archaea,
Euryarchaeota and the novel candidate division JS1, followed by multiple
regression, showed strong relationships with prokaryotic activity and
geochemistry (R(2)=55-100%). Further correlation analysis, at one site, between
the principal components from the community composition profiles for Bacteria and
12 other variables quantitatively confirmed their relationship with activity and 
geochemistry, which had previously only been implied. Comparison with previously 
published cell counts enumerated by fluorescent in situ hybridization with
rRNA-targeted probes confirmed that these denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
profiles described an active prokaryotic community.
