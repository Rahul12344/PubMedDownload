Clinical trials with anti-inflammatory agents in patients with sepsis are based
on the assumption that excessive proinflammatory activity of the cytokine network
negatively influences the outcome of severe bacterial infections. The failure of 
these trials to show clinical benefit, in conjunction with recent experimental
data, raises doubt about the validity of this assumption. This article
reevaluates the role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of sepsis and severe
bacterial infections. The cytokine network is discussed as consisting of
proinflammatory cytokines, antiinflammatory cytokines, and soluble inhibitors of 
proinflammatory cytokines.
