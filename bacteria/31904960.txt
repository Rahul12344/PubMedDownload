A series of derivatives of the antimycobacterial natural product pyridomycin have
been prepared with the C2 side chain attached to the macrocyclic core structure
by a C-C single bond, in place of the synthetically more demanding enol ester
double bond found in the natural product. Hydrophobic C2 substituents of
sufficient size generally provide for potent anti-Mtb activity of these
dihydropyridomycins (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values around 2.5
μM), with several analogs thus approaching the activity of natural pyridomycin.
Surprisingly, some of these compounds, in contrast to pyridomycin, are
insensitive to overexpression of InhA in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). This
indicates that their anti-Mtb activity does not critically depend on the
inhibition of InhA and that their overall mode of action may differ from that of 
the original natural product lead.
