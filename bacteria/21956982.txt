The N-acylneuraminate cytidyltransferase gene, neuA, is heterogenous in
Legionella pneumophila strains but can be used as a marker for epidemiological
typing in the consensus sequence-based typing scheme.

Sequence-based typing (SBT) is the internationally recognized standard method for
genotyping Legionella pneumophila. To date all strains of serogroup 1 (SG1) and
some of SGs 2 to 14 yield a seven-allele profile and can be assigned a sequence
type (ST). However, for some strains belonging to SGs 2 to 14, the targeted
region of the neuA gene could not be amplified using the published standard
primers. We determined the DNA sequence of a neuA gene homolog located in the
lipopolysaccharide synthesis locus of strain Dallas-1E. By using newly designed
degenerate consensus primers based on the neuA homolog in strains Dallas-1E,
Philadelphia-1, Paris, Lens, and Corby, we were able to obtain DNA sequences for 
all 48 non-SG1 strains which were untypeable by the standard method. Our data
show that the neuA gene is present in all L. pneumophila strains but differs
significantly in some non-SG1 strains at both the DNA and amino acid levels. The 
new primers can be used to amplify and sequence the neuA gene in all strains and 
can substitute for the standard primers. This offers the possibility of assigning
an ST to all strains of L. pneumophila.
