Non-classical class Ib (class Ib) genes are found in all jawed vertebrates,
including the amphibian Xenopus, which possesses at least 20 distinct Xenopus
non-classical class Ib genes (XNCs). As an immune evasion strategy, tumors often 
downregulate surface expression of classical major histocompatibility complex
class Ia molecules. In contrast, cancers commonly express class Ib molecules,
presenting an alternative for tumor immune recognition. We characterized a novel 
XNC, XNC10, functionally similar to CD1d from a class Ia-deficient thymic
lymphoid tumor (15/0), which grows aggressively in Xenopus LG-15 cloned animals. 
To investigate the roles of XNC10 in antitumor immunity, we generated stable
15/0-transfectants with silenced XNC10 mRNA and protein expression. Notably,
XNC10 silencing resulted in acute tumor rejection by naturally class Ia-deficient
syngeneic tadpoles, with greater potency of rejection in tumors with more
efficient XNC10 knockdown. In vivo killing assays shows that the rejection of
XNC10-deficient tumors is due to a cell-mediated cytotoxic immune response
elicited by the tadpole host. Importantly, priming enhances XNC10-deficient tumor
rejection. Flow cytometry reveals that XNC10-deficient tumor rejection is
associated with an accumulation of XNC10-restricted invariant T cells and
conventional CD8 T cells as well as other leukocytes. Similarly, semisolid tumor 
grafts in tadpoles also exhibit leukocytes infiltration. These findings suggest
that XNC10 allows the 15/0-tumor to escape immune recognition and class
Ia-independent cytotoxicity, thus emphasizing the critical roles of class Ibs in 
tumor immunity.
