Isolation of a mycoplasma from sarcoid tissue.

Jansson E, Hannuksela M, Eklund H, Halme H, Tuuri S.

Using a modified cell-free culture medium, a mycoplasma was isolated from sarcoid
lymph nodes in two cases and from sarcoid skin lesions in four out of seven cases
of chronic sarcoidosis. Growth inhibition tests showed that the isolates were
related to Mycoplasma orale type 1. By the indirect haemagglutination method, 244
cases of definite or probable sarcoidosis, 160 patients with other diseases, and 
355 blood donors were tested for antibodies against an isolated mycoplasma
(strain 215-M). Titres [unk] 16 were found in 14% of the patients with
sarcoidosis and in 8% of the patients with other diseases but only in 0.6% of the
blood donors. The proportion of patients with high antibody titres among those
with sarcoidosis and erythema nodosum was smaller (8%) than among those with
other forms of sarcoidosis (17%). The role of the mycoplasmas isolated from
sarcoid tissues remains obscure, but it is possible that these organisms are only
an expression of altered immunity in sarcoidosis.
