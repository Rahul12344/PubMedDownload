Vascular response is an essential aspect of an effective immune response to
periodontal disease pathogens, as new blood vessel formation contributes to wound
healing and inflammation. Gaining a greater understanding of the factors that
affect vascular response may then contribute to future breakthroughs in dental
medicine. In this study, we have characterized the endothelial cell response to
the common bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, an important bridging species that 
facilitates the activity of late colonizers of the dental biofilm. Endothelial
cells were infected with Fusobacterium nucleatum (strain 25586) for periods of 4,
12, 24, or 48 h. Cell proliferation and tube formation were analyzed, and
expression of adhesion molecules (CD31 and CD34) and vascular endothelial growth 
factor (VEGF) receptors 1 and 2 was measured by fluorescence-activated cell
sorter (FACS) analysis. Data indicate that F. nucleatum impaired endothelial cell
proliferation and tube formation. The findings suggest that the modified
endothelial cell response acts as a mechanism promoting the pathogenic
progression of periodontal diseases and may potentially suggest the involvement
of periodontopathogens in systemic diseases associated with periodontal
inflammation.
