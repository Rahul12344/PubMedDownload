T cell costimulatory and coinhibitory pathways are essential orchestrators and
regulators of the adaptive immune response. In recent years, the costimulatory
CD28 receptor and B7 ligand families have been expanded to include a total of
four and seven members, respectively. Several polymorphisms, mutations, and
deletions in both regulatory and protein-coding regions of these genes have
subsequently been discovered and evaluated for genetic linkage to various human
diseases. Here, we review this evidence as we discuss T cell costimulation and
coinhibition in the context of genetic susceptibility to autoimmunity, cancer,
and other diseases. As we gain further insight into the functional significance
and mechanism of these immunoregulatory pathways by both genetic and
immunological approaches, these receptors and ligands are poised to become key
targets for immunotherapy.
