Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are derived from common lymphoid
progenitors (CLPs) via several specific precursors, and the transcription factors
essential for ILC2 differentiation have been extensively studied. However, the
external factors regulating commitment to the ILC lineage as well as the sites
and stromal cells that constitute the optimal microenvironment for ILC2-specific 
differentiation are not fully defined. In this study, we demonstrate that three
key external factors, the concentration of interleukin 7 (IL-7) and strength and 
duration of Notch signaling, coordinately determine the fate of CLP toward the T,
B, or ILC lineage. Additionally, we identified three stages of ILC2 in the fetal 
mesentery that require STAT5 signals for maturation: ILC progenitors, CCR9+ ILC2 
progenitors, and KLRG1- immature ILC2. We further demonstrate that ILC2
development is supported by mesenteric platelet-derived growth factor receptor α 
(PDGFRα)+ glycoprotein 38 (gp38)+ mesenchymal cells. Collectively, our results
suggest that early differentiation of ILC2 occurs in the fetal liver via IL-7 and
Notch signaling, whereas final differentiation occurs in the periphery with the
aid of PDGFRα+gp38+ cells.
