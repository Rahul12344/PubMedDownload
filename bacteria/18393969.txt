Toll-like receptors play an essential role in the innate recognition of
micro-organisms by the host. CD14 is one of the extracellular adaptor proteins
required for recognition of Gram-negative bacteria and possibly also
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore, we intranasally infected wild-type (WT)
and CD14 knock-out (KO) mice with virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv. We found no
differences in bacterial load in the main target organ lung up to 32 weeks after 
infection. From 20 weeks onward 57% of WT mice succumbed, whereas all CD14 KO
mice survived. The improved outcome of CD14 KO mice was accompanied by reduced
pulmonary inflammation; lung cell counts and percentage of inflamed lung tissue
were reduced in CD14 WT mice. These data suggest that during chronic infection
CD14 KO mice are protected from lethality caused by lung tuberculosis because of 
a reduction of the inflammatory response.
