For bacterial growth on substrates with only one or two carbon atoms, special
assimilation pathways are required. In 1957, the glyoxylate cycle of Kornberg and
Krebs was described for bacterial growth on C2 compounds such as ethanol and
acetate. However this pathway did not operate in some photosynthetic bacteria and
in some methylotrophs when they were growing on C2 compounds, so an alternative
pathway must exist. By 1973 Quayle's serine cycle had been described for
methylotrophs growing on C1 compounds such as methanol, but the pathway was
incomplete, the unknown part also functioning during growth on C2 compounds.
After more than 35 further years of research, the ethylmalonyl-CoA (EMC) pathway 
for growth on C2 compounds, of photosynthetic bacteria has recently been
elucidated. This pathway also operates in methylotrophs during growth on C2
compounds, and on C1 compounds by way of the serine cycle. This review is a
celebration of half a century of research and of the fascinating result of that
research.
