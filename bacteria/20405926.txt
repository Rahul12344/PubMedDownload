Evaporative deposition from a sessile drop is a simple and appealing way to
deposit materials on a surface. In this work, we deposit living, motile colloidal
particles (bacteria) on mica from drops of aqueous solution. We show for the
first time that it is possible to produce a continuous variation in the
deposition pattern from ring deposits to cellular pattern deposits by incremental
changes in surface wettability which we achieve by timed exposure of the mica
surface to the atmosphere. We show that it is possible to change the contact
angle of the drop from less than 5 degrees to near 20 degrees by choice of
atmospheric exposure time. This controls the extent of drop spreading, which in
turn determines the architecture of the deposition pattern.
