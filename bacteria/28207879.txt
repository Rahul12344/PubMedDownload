Imputation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles from SNP-level data is
attractive due to importance of HLA alleles in human disease, widespread
availability of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and expertise required
for HLA sequencing. However, comprehensive evaluations of HLA imputations
programs are limited. We compared HLA imputation results of HIBAG, SNP2HLA, and
HLA*IMP:02 to sequenced HLA alleles in 3,265 samples from BioVU, a de-identified 
electronic health record database coupled to a DNA biorepository. We performed
four-digit HLA sequencing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DPB1, and -DQB1 using
long-read 454 FLX sequencing. All samples were genotyped using both the Illumina 
HumanExome BeadChip platform and a GWAS platform. Call rates and concordance
rates were compared by platform, frequency of allele, and race/ethnicity. Overall
concordance rates were similar between programs in European Americans (EA) (0.975
[SNP2HLA]; 0.939 [HLA*IMP:02]; 0.976 [HIBAG]). SNP2HLA provided a significant
advantage in terms of call rate and the number of alleles imputed. Concordance
rates were lower overall for African Americans (AAs). These observations were
consistent when accuracy was compared across HLA loci. All imputation programs
performed similarly for low frequency HLA alleles. Higher concordance rates were 
observed when HLA alleles were imputed from GWAS platforms versus the HumanExome 
BeadChip, suggesting that high genomic coverage is preferred as input for HLA
allelic imputation. These findings provide guidance on the best use of HLA
imputation methods and elucidate their limitations.
