Lymphatic vessels return extravasated fluid, proteins, and cells back into the
circulation and are important in immune cell trafficking. In the gingiva,
lymphatic vessels are located in the lamina propria and travel over the external 
surface of the alveolar bone. The gingival lymphatics are important for fluid
drainage, since lack of lymphatics has been shown to increase interstitial fluid 
pressure and fluid volume. Maintenance of gingival lymphatic vessels requires
continuous signaling by the growth factors VEGF-C and -D via their receptor
VEGFR-3. The growth factors are expressed in the gingival epithelium and also in 
immune cells in the lamina propria. VEGF-C seems to be crucial for
lymphangiogenesis induced during periodontal disease development. The lymphatic
vessels protect against periodontitis in mice, probably by clearing bacteria and 
bacterial products and by promoting humoral immune responses. Down-regulation of 
CCL21, a ligand important for dendritic cell migration, has been demonstrated in 
lymphatics from patients with periodontitis. High enzymatic activity in the
gingiva of these patients may also contribute to impaired lymphatic function, due
to the loss of structural components in the interstitium influencing lymphatic
function. So far, knowledge is limited in this field because of the dearth of
studies on the role of lymphatic vessels in periodontal disease.
