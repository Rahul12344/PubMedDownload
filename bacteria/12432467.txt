An isolated bacterium, Alcaligenes denitrificans ITRC-4, metabolizes
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) under both aerobic and
anaerobic conditions. The aerobic metabolism is inhibited by 38% and 47% in the
presence of 1.0 g L(-1) of sodium acetate and sodium succinate, respectively, but
remains uninhibited in the presence of 1.0 g L(-1) of glucose. Also, the
metabolism is inhibited completely in the presence of biphenyl vapors, as well as
0.8 g L(-1) of 2,2'-bipyridyl. Under anaerobic conditions, DDT is metabolized
into 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDD), which is further enhanced 
by 50% in the presence of 1.0 g L(-1) of glucose. Besides, the bacterium also
metabolizes 4-chlorobenzoate, which is accompanied by the release of chloride
ions.
