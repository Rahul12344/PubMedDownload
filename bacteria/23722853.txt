Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA gyrase, a nanomachine involved in the regulation
of DNA topology, is the only type II topoisomerase present in this organism and
hence is the sole target of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of tuberculosis.
The ATPase domain provides the energy required for catalysis by ATP hydrolysis.
Two constructs corresponding to this 43 kDa domain, Mtb-GyrB47(C1) and
Mtb-GyrB47(C2), have been overproduced, purified and crystallized. Diffraction
data were collected from three crystal forms. The crystals belonged to space
groups P1 and P21 and diffracted to resolutions of 2.9 and 3.3 Å, respectively.
