Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells provide cognate help via CD1d to lipid
antigen-presenting B cells for antibody production, but whether B cells
reciprocally regulate iNKT cells remains largely unexplored. Here, we found
peripheral, but not thymic, iNKT cells to be numerically reduced in autoimmune
mice lacking Fas specifically in B cells. The residual iNKT cells were
antigenically overstimulated, had altered cytokine production, and manifested
enhanced proliferation and apoptosis. B cell-specific ablation of CD1d
ameliorated these iNKT defects, suggesting that inappropriate presentation of
CD1d-restricted self-lipids by autoimmune B cell-depleted peripheral iNKT cells. 
CD1d(+) autoimmune B cells have reduced α-galactosidase A expression and, as
revealed by lipidomic profiling, altered lipidome with aberrant accumulation of
certain self-lipids and reduction of others. These findings unveil a critical
link between autoimmunity, B cell lipidome, and the maintenance of peripheral
iNKT cells and highlight an essential homeostatic function of B cells beyond
antibody production.
