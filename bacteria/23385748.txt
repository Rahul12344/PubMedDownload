β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NagA) protein hs a chitin-degrading activity and
chitin is one of the most abundant polymers in nature. NagA contains a family 3
glycoside (GH3)-type N-terminal domain and a unique C-terminal domain. The
structurally uncharacterized C-terminal domain of NagA may be involved in
substrate specificity. To provide a structural basis for the substrate
specificity of NagA, structural analysis of NagA from Thermotoga maritima encoded
by the Tm0809 gene was initiated. NagA from T. maritima has been overexpressed in
Escherichia coli and crystallized at 296 K using ammonium sulfate as a
precipitant. Crystals of T. maritima NagA diffracted to 3.80 Å resolution and
belonged to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 231.15, 
b = 133.62, c = 140.88 Å, β = 89.97°. The crystallization of
selenomethionyl-substituted protein is in progress to solve the crystal structure
of T. maritima NagA.
