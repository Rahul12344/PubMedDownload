Modulation of airway surface liquid (ASL) pH has been proposed as a therapy for
cystic fibrosis (CF). However, evidence that ASL pH is reduced in CF is limited
and conflicting. The technical challenges associated with measuring ASL pH in
vivo have precluded accurate measurements in humans. In order to address this
deficiency, ASL pH was measured in vivo in children using a novel luminescent
technology integrated with fibre-optic probes. Here we show that ASL pH in
children with CF is similar to that of children without CF. Findings were
supported by highly controlled direct pH measurements in primary human airway
epithelial cell culture models, which also suggest that the potential ASL pH
gradient produced by defective apical ion transport is balanced out by
paracellular shunting of acid/base. Thus, reduced baseline ASL pH is unlikely to 
be an important pathobiological factor in early CF lung disease.
