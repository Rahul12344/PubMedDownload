Vitamin D has immuno-modulatory properties, and deficient levels of circulating
25-hydroxyvitamin D (<30 nmol/l) may contribute to increased risk of infectious
illnesses. This narrative review summarises data on vitamin D status in Europe
and updates results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding vitamin D
and airway infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and acute upper respiratory tract
infection. In Europe, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is up to 37% in the 
general population and up to 80% in nursing home residents and non-European
immigrants. Half of TB patients have a migration background. While results of
RCTs do not support the concept of beneficial adjunctive effects of vitamin D
supplements in anti-TB treatment [odds ratio (OR) = 0.86; 95% CI 0.62-1.19], the 
few published RCTs on the prophylaxis of TB suggest some protective vitamin D
effects in individuals with deficient circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels.
Regarding acute respiratory tract infection, RCTs indicate a significant risk
reduction by vitamin D supplements [OR = 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.50-0.85]. There is evidence that daily administration is more effective than
high-dose bolus administration [OR = 0.48 (95% CI 0.30-0.77) vs. OR = 0.87 (95%
CI 0.67-1.14)] and that individuals with deficient or insufficient (30-50 nmol/l)
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels benefit most. Several vitamin D effects on
innate immunity may explain these protective effects. In summary, there is
possible evidence from RCTs for protective vitamin D effects on TB and likely
evidence for protective effects on acute airway infection. Since vitamin D
deficiency is prevalent in Europe, especially in institutionalised individuals
and non-European immigrants, daily oral vitamin D intake, e.g. 1000 international
units, is an inexpensive measure to ensure adequate vitamin D status in
individuals at risk.
