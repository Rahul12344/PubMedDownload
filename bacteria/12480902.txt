The chromosomal arsenic-resistance (ars) operon of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
is atypical in that it is divergent, with its arsCR and arsBH genes transcribed
in opposite directions. Furthermore, the amino-acid sequence of the putative
ArsR-like regulator of the ars operon is not conserved in regions that have been 
shown to be responsible for binding to arsenic. Instead, the ArsR-like protein of
At. ferrooxidans is related to a group of unstudied ArsR-like proteins that have 
been found to be associated with chromosomal ars-like operons identified during
genome-sequencing projects. Using arsB-lacZ, arsR-lacZ and arsC-lacZ fusions, it 
was shown that the ArsR-like protein of At. ferrooxidans is a repressor of the
arsBH and arsRC genes of this organism, and that induction of gene expression
took place when either AsIII (arsenite) or AsV (arsenate) were added. Deletion of
19 aa from the C terminus of the 118 aa ArsR protein did not affect the
regulation of its activity, but deletion of an additional 28 aa inactivated ArsR.
Northern-blot hybridization suggested that on induction of expression, the arsRC 
genes were transcribed in greater quantities than the arsBH genes, but that the
level of induction was not affected by the form of arsenic added (AsIII or AsV).
