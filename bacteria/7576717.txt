The complement protein C4 exists as two isotypes, C4A and C4B, encoded by genes
in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region. The serum
concentrations of C4A4 were lower than those of C4B2 in serum from 19 individuals
homozygous for type I C2 deficiency (p < 0.0002). These individuals all had the
S042 complotype and most of them were homozygous for the haplotype
HLA-B18,S042,DR2. In 14 individuals heterozygous for the C2Q0 gene and with the
C4A4, C4B2 phenotype and in 51 individuals with the C4A3, C4B1 phenotype, the
isotype concentrations were equal. Factor B concentrations in the C2-deficient
individuals were lower than those in individuals with the C4A3, C4B1 phenotype (p
< 0.0001). The findings strongly suggest that the quantitative expression of C4
isotypes and factor B is MHC haplotype dependent. C4 null alleles cannot be
accurately determined by measuring relative C4 isotype serum concentrations.
