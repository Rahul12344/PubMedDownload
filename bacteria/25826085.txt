Enforced expression of miR-34a eliminates cancer stem cells in some malignant
tumors. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) is a direct target of miR-34a. Here we found low levels
of miR-34a and high levels of SIRT1 in CD44+/CD24- breast cancer stem cells
(BCSCs). MiR-34a overexpression and knockdown of SIRT1 decreased proportion of
BSCSs and mammosphere formation. Expression of CSC markers, ALDH1, BMI1 and Nanog
was decreased. In nude mice xenografts, stable expression of miR-34a and
silencing of SIRT1 reduced tumor burden. Taken together, our results demonstrated
that miR-34a inhibits proliferative potential of BCSCs in vitro and in vivo, at
least partially by downregulating SIRT1. The miR-34a-SIRT1 axis may play role in 
self-renewal of BCSCs.
