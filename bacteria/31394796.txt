Unlike other breast cancer subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has no 
specific targets and is characterized as one of the most aggressive subtypes of
breast cancer that disproportionately accounts for the majority of breast
cancer-related deaths. Current conventional chemotherapeutics target the bulk
tumor population, but not the cancer stem cells (CSCs) that are capable of
initiating new tumors to cause disease relapse. Recent studies have identified
distinct epithelial-like (E) ALDH+ CSCs, mesenchymal-like (M) CD44+/CD24- CSCs,
and hybrid E/M ALDH+/CD44+/CD24- CSCs. These subtypes of CSCs exhibit
differential signal pathway regulations, possess plasticity, and respond
differently to treatment. As such, co-inhibition of different subtypes of CSCs is
key to viable therapy. This review serves to highlight different pathway
regulations in E and M CSCs in TNBC, and to further describe their role in
disease progression. Potential inhibitors targeting E and/or M CSCs based on
clinical trials are summarized for further investigation. Since future research
needs to adopt suitable tumor models and take into account the divergence of E
and M CSCs for the development of effective treatments, TNBC models for
clinically translatable studies are further discussed.
