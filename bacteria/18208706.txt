Urinary tract infections are frequently a result of insufficient urinary
drainage. Abnormalities of the urinary tract, bladder and/or urethral dysfunction
and bad voiding habits often lead to poor bladder emptying. Foreign bodies in the
urinary tract increase the risk of urinary tract infections. In hospitals the
primary risk factor is instrumentation of the urinary tract mainly by
catheterisation. It is important to diagnose the causes of possible insufficient 
drainage. The use of catheterisation should be clearly indicated and documented
in the patient's medical records.
