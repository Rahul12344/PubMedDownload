Quorum sensing (QS) has been a novel target for the treatment of infectious
diseases. Here structural analogs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa autoinducer N-acyl
homoserine lactone (AHL) were investigated for QS inhibitor (QSI) activity and a 
novel QSI was discovered, N-decanoyl-L-homoserine benzyl ester (C2). Virulence
assays showed that C2 down-regulated total protease and elastase activities, as
well as the production of rhamnolipid, that are controlled by QS in P. aeruginosa
wild-type strain PAO1 without affecting growth. C2 was also shown to inhibit
swarming motility of PAO1. Using a microdilution checkerboard method, we
identified synergistic interactions between C2 and several antibiotics,
tobramycin, gentamycin, cefepime, and meropenem. Data from real-time RT-PCR
suggested that C2 inhibited the expression of lasR (29.67%), lasI (21.57%), rhlR 
(28.20%), and rhlI (29.03%).
