While most T cells use a CD3-associated alpha/beta T cell receptor as antigen
recognition structure, a second population of T cells expresses the alternative
gamma/delta T cell receptor. gamma/delta T cells are a minor population in the
peripheral blood but constitute a major population among intestinal
intraepithelial lymphocytes. Most gamma/delta T cells recognize ligands which are
fundamentally different from the short peptides that are seen by alpha/beta T
cells in the context of MHC class I or class II molecules. Thus, human Vdelta2 T 
cells recognize small bacterial phosphoantigens, alkylamines and synthetic
aminobisphosphonates, whereas Vdelta1 T cells recognize stress-inducible
MHC-related molecules MICA/B as well as several other ligands. At the functional 
level, gamma/delta T cells rapidly produce a variety of cytokines and usually
exert potent cytotoxic activity, also towards many tumor cells. In this article, 
we discuss the role of gamma/delta T cells as a bridge between the innate and the
adaptive immune system, based on the interpretation that gamma/delta T cells use 
their T cell receptor as a pattern recognition receptor. Our increasing
understanding of the ligand recognition and activation mechanisms of gamma/delta 
T cells also opens new perspectives for the development of gamma/delta T
cell-based immunotherapies.
