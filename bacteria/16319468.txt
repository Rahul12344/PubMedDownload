It is known that Staphylococcus aureus induces the expression of human
beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2), a well-characterized antimicrobial peptide, in
keratinocytes. However, in spite of heavy colonization of atopic dermatitis (AD) 
skin lesions by S. aureus, these lesions have consistently been shown to contain 
low expression of hBD-2. The current article discusses various possible
mechanisms for the low expression of hBD-2 in AD and raises the question whether 
the innate recognition of S. aureus by keratinocytes in AD is intact.
