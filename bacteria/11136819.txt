We have studied the recruitment and roles of distinct dendritic cell (DC)
precursors from the circulation into Propionibacterium acnes-induced granulomas
in mouse liver. During infection, F4/80(-)B220(-)CD11c(+) DC precursors appeared 
in the circulation, migrated into the perisinusoidal space, and matured within
newly formed granulomas. Recruited DCs later migrated to the portal area to
interact with T cells in what we term "portal tract-associated lymphoid tissue"
(PALT). Macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha attracted blood DC precursors to
the sinusoidal granuloma, whereas secondary lymphoid organ chemokine (SLC)
attracted mature DCs to the newly identified PALT. Anti-SLC antibody diminished
PALT expansion while exacerbating granuloma formation. Therefore, circulating DC 
precursors can migrate into a solid organ like liver, and participate in the
granulomatous reaction in response to specific chemokines.
