The rational modification of the actinomycetes genomes has a variety of
applications in research, medicine, and biotechnology. The use of site-specific
recombinases allows generation of multiple mutations, large DNA deletions,
integrations, and inversions and may lead to significant progress in all of these
fields. Despite their huge potential, site-specific recombinase-based
technologies have primarily been used for simple marker removal from a
chromosome. In this review, we summarise the site-specific recombination
approaches for genome engineering in various actinomycetes.
