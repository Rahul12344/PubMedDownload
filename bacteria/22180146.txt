Despite chlorogenic acid (CGA) being widely present in nature, particularly in
the human diet, there is very little information regarding its pharmacological
activities. The present investigation was carried out to investigate the
antiarthritic activities of this compound in adjuvant induced-arthritis in male
Wistar rats, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of actions in view of
immunological responses. We observed that CGA effectively controlled the total
(CD3) and differentiated (CD4 and CD8) T cells count at the dose of 40 mg/kg. We 
also assessed the effect on co-stimulatory molecules (CD28, CD80/86) and found
that CGA efficiently suppressed CD80/86 but failed to bring any changes in the
CD28 count, whereas ibuprofen (standard drug) resulted in highly significant
inhibition of both. We next examined the effect on CD4⁺ T cells specific Th1/Th2 
cytokines by flow cytometry and observed that CGA suppressed the Th1 cytokines in
a highly significant manner but elevated Th2 cytokines with dose dependence.
Results of the present investigation suggest that CGA is a potent antiarthritic
agent.
