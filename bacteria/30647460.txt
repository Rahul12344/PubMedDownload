Sponges host a remarkable diversity of microbial symbionts, however, the benefit 
their microbes provide is rarely understood. Here, we describe two new sponge
species from deep-sea asphalt seeps and show that they live in a nutritional
symbiosis with methane-oxidizing (MOX) bacteria. Metagenomics and imaging
analyses revealed unusually high amounts of MOX symbionts in hosts from a group
previously assumed to have low microbial abundances. These symbionts belonged to 
the Marine Methylotrophic Group 2 clade. They are host-specific and likely
vertically transmitted, based on their presence in sponge embryos and streamlined
genomes, which lacked genes typical of related free-living MOX. Moreover, genes
known to play a role in host-symbiont interactions, such as those that encode
eukaryote-like proteins, were abundant and expressed. Methane assimilation by the
symbionts was one of the most highly expressed metabolic pathways in the sponges.
Molecular and stable carbon isotope patterns of lipids confirmed that
methane-derived carbon was incorporated into the hosts. Our results revealed that
two species of sponges, although distantly related, independently established
highly specific, nutritional symbioses with two closely related methanotrophs.
This convergence in symbiont acquisition underscores the strong selective
advantage for these sponges in harboring MOX bacteria in the food-limited deep
sea.
