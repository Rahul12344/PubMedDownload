Two autochthonous clams, Venerupis aurea laeta and Cerastoderma edule/glaucum,
collected for a period of 1 year, from May 2007 to January 2008, were studied in 
the Cape Peloro lagoon. On the samples, it was evaluated the presence of
pathogenic microorganisms and proteins, lipids and yield edible part were
determined. It was evaluated the concentration of mineral elements (Cd, Cu, Mn,
Se, Pb, Zn) and organic contaminants (âˆ‘DDT and PCBs). Salmonella is never present
in any sample. Total and faecal coliform values have always been under law limits
for alive bivalves mussels production and sale. Zn, Cu, Cd and Pb levels were
found in clams where they are slightly lower too. Both species do not show
significant changes for Mn and Se. DDT and PCBs traces were discovered in
Ganzirri Lake' samples, but in all observed cases, they were below law limits. As
a result of all these observations, it is clear that, in recent years, the
bivalve's use of Ganzirri Lake does not denote toxicological risk to human
health.
