A novel vip3-type gene named vip3LB has been isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis
strain BUPM95. The corresponding secreted vegetative insecticidal protein was
active against the lepidopteran insect Ephestia kuehniella. The vip3LB gene was
shown, for the first time, to be carried by the large plasmid containing the
cry1Ia genes of B. thuringiensis. The nucleotide sequence predicted a protein of 
789 amino acids residues with a calculated molecular mass of 88.5kDa. Both
nucleotide and amino acid sequences similarity analysis revealed that vip3LB is a
new vip3-type gene, presenting several differences with the other vip3-type
genes. Heterologous expression of the vip3LB under the control of the strong
promoter P(BAD) was performed in Escherichia coli and the produced protein
conferred insecticidal activity against Ephestia kuehniella. This novel
vegetative insecticidal protein Vip3LB could be a very useful biological control 
agent.
