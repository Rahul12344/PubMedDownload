BACKGROUND: Aging is the most important risk factor for prostate cancer (PCa),
but how age contributes to PCa is poorly understood. Aging is characterized by
low-grade systemic inflammation (i.e., inflammaging) that is often attributed to 
the progressive activation of immune cells over time, which may play an important
role in prostate carcinogenesis. Th17 response is elevated in aging humans and
mice, but it remains unknown whether it is increased in prostate tissue or
contributes to prostate carcinogenesis during aging. In this study, we aimed to
determine the role of age-related Th17 response in PCa cell growth, migration,
and invasion.
METHODS: C57BL/6J (B6) mouse was used as an aging animal model and the prostate
histopathology during aging was analyzed. Splenic CD4+ T cells were isolated from
young (16-20 weeks old) and aged (96-104 weeks old) mice, and cultured in the
presence of plate-bound anti-CD3/anti-CD28, with or without Th17 differentiation 
conditions. The cells were collected and used for subsequent flow cytometry or
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The supernatant was
collected and used to treat PCa cell lines. The treated PCa cells were analyzed
for cell viability, migration, invasion, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)
signaling.
RESULTS: Aged mice had enlarged prostate glands and increased morphological
alterations, with not only increased inflammatory cell infiltration but also
increased Th17 cytokines in prostate tissue, compared to young mice. Naïve CD4+ T
cells from aged mice differentiated increased interleukin (IL)-17-expressing
cells. CD4+ T cells from aged mice spleen had increased Th17 cells, Th17
cytokines and Th17/Treg ratio compared to young mice. Factors secreted from aged 
CD4+ T cells, especially from ex vivo differentiated Th17 cells, not only
promoted PCa cell viability, migration, and invasion but also activated the NF-κB
signaling in PCa cells compared to young mice.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that age-related CD4+ T cells, especially
Th17 cells-secreted factors have the potential to contribute to prostate
carcinogenesis. Our work could prompt further research using autochthonous PCa
mouse models at different ages to elucidate the functional role of Th17 response 
in prostate carcinogenesis during aging.
