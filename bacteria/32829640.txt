Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an essential nutritional supplement for human
health. The most prominent dietary source of EPA is fish oil, which is
unsustainable because of the decline in fishery resources and serious
environmental pollution. Alternatively, a heterologous polyketide synthase
pathway for EPA biosynthesis was assembled in Thraustochytrid Aurantiochytrium. A
2A peptide-based facile assembly platform that can achieve multigene expression
as a polycistron was first established. The platform was then applied to express 
the EPA biosynthetic gene cluster from Shewanella japonica in Aurantiochytrium.
In the shake flask fermentation, the lipid and PUFA yields of the mutant were
increased by 26.9 and 36.0%, respectively, and led to about 5-fold increase of
the EPA yield. The final EPA titer reached 2.7 g/L in fed-batch fermentation.
This study provides a novel metabolic engineering strategy to regulate the EPA
ratio in microalgal oil for human nutritional supplementation.
