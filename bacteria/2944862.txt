Susceptibility of bacteria to serum lysis or phagocytosis following growth in
subinhibitory levels of lincosaminide or spectinomycin related antibiotics.

Cialdella JI, Vavra JJ, Marshall VP.

The effects of subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on polymorphonuclear
leukocyte (PML) and serum killing of Staphylococcus aureus 502A (UC 9116) and
Escherichia coli UC 9451 were studied. Exposure of these bacteria to
subinhibitory levels of certain lincosaminides, spectinomycin, or
6'-n-propylspectinomycin altered their susceptibility to these host defense
mechanisms, while exposure to gentamicin had no effect. However, each organism
responded differently to treatment with the antibiotics. S. aureus pretreated
during log phase growth with subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin,
lincomycin, or pirlimycin was more susceptible to killing by PMLs than untreated 
bacteria. No effect on phagocytic killing was found when S. aureus was pretreated
with spectinomycin, 6'-n-propylspectinomycin, or gentamicin. The S. aureus
remained resistant to serum lysis despite antibiotic treatment. In contrast,
spectinomycin and 6'-n-propylspectinomycin as well as clindamycin dramatically
increased the susceptibility of E. coli to serum lysis (greater than 99%
destroyed). Moderate killing of E. coli by PMLs was also found.
