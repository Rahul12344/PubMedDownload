BACKGROUND: Intestinal bacteria and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) may
modulate the mucosal immune response. In this study, immune modulation by
Lactobacillus GG (LGG) and Bifidobacterium breve (Bb1, Bb2) in the presence or
absence of IEC was addressed in an in vitro transwell co-culture model.
METHODS: UV-killed LGG,Bb1, Bb2 or Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 or nucleotide
oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 ligands were added directly to unstimulated or
anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated PBMC, or applied apically to human IEC (HT-29)
co-cultured with PBMC. A mixture of live bacteria was used as reference. The
effect on T helper 1 (IFN-gamma, IL-12), T helper 2 (IL-13), inflammatory
(TNF-alpha) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokine secretion was determined.
RESULTS: Both UV-killed LGG and Bb enhanced IL-12, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and
IL-10, and reduced IL-13 secretion when added directly to stimulated PBMC,
similar to live bacteria. IEC reduced IL-13, IFN-gamma and IL-10 secretion by
stimulated PBMC. Apically added LGG, TLR2 and NOD2 ligands,but not Bb, enhanced
IFN-gamma, IL-12 and/or TNF-alpha secretion. Bacteria did not induce cytokine
secretion when added to HT-29/unstimulated PBMC co-cultures, whereas direct
incubations with PBMC did.
CONCLUSION: UV-killed LGG as well as Bb supported a T helper 1 and/or regulatory 
phenotype when added directly to activated PBMC, similar to live bacteria. In
contrast, LGG, TLR2 or NOD2 ligands - but not Bb - enhanced T helper 1 type
cytokine secretion when added to IEC, while IL-10 secretion remained suppressed. 
Co-cultures combining IEC and PBMC may reveal differences between bacterial
strains relevant for the in vivo situation.
