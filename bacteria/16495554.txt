Q fever is an infectious disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, an obligate
intracellular bacterium that replicates in macrophages. As cell-mediated immune
response to microbial pathogens requires signals mediated by T-cell receptors and
costimulatory molecules such as CD28, we wondered if CD28 is involved in
protection against C. burnetii infection. CD28-deficient (CD28-/-) mice were
inoculated with C. burnetii by intraperitoneal and intravenous routes. With both 
wild-type and CD28-/- mice, C. burnetii organisms were detected exclusively in
spleen and liver. The antibody response against C. burnetii was impaired in
CD28-/- animals, but, surprisingly, the lack of CD28 decreased C. burnetii burden
in the infected tissues, whatever the manner of inoculation of bacteria. The CD28
deficiency had no effect on either granuloma formation, which reflects
cell-mediated immunity against C. burnetii, or the production of gamma interferon
and tumor necrosis factor, two cytokines known to be involved in granuloma
formation. On the other hand, the production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by
peritoneal macrophages was highly impaired in CD28-/- mice. The results suggest
that CD28 initiates a signal that favors C. burnetii replication through the
modulation of the IL-10 pathway.
