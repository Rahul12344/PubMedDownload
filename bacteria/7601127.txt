The UDP-N-acetylmuramate:L-alanine ligase of Escherichia coli was over-produced
in strains harbouring recombinant plasmids bearing the murC gene under the
control of the lac or trc promoter. Plasmid pAM1005, in which the promoter and
ribosome-binding site region of murC were removed and in which the gene was
directly under the control of promoter trc, led to a 2000-fold amplification of
the L-alanine-adding activity after induction by
isopropyl-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The murC gene product was visualized as 
a 50-kDa protein accounting for approximately 50% of the cell protein. A two-step
purification led to 1 g of a homogeneous protein from an 18-1 culture. The
N-terminal sequence of the purified protein correlated with the nucleotide
sequence of the murC gene. The presence of 2-mercaptoethanol and glycerol was
essential for the stability of the enzyme. The Km values for UDP-N-acetylmuramic 
acid, L-alanine and ATP/Mg2+ were estimated at 100, 20 and 450 microM,
respectively. Under the optimal in vitro conditions a turnover number of 928
min-1 was calculated and a copy number/cell of 600 could be roughly estimated.
The specificity of the enzyme for its substrates was investigated with various
analogues. The enzyme also catalysed the reverse reaction.
