Laboratory transmission of enterobacteriaceae by the oriental cockroach, Blatta
orientalis.

Burgess NR, McDermott SN, Whiting J.

Methods of maintaining and feeding and of infecting cockroaches with pathogenic
organisms were investigated.Cockroaches fed on known concentrations of
Escherichia coli O119, Esch. coli O1, Alkalescens Dispar O group 2 and Shigella
dysenteriae 1 (Shiga's Bacillus) were maintained in Petri dishes. The effect of
various diets on the survival of these organisms within the hind-gut and faeces
was observed. With a ;normal' diet of gruel Esch. coli O119 was isolated for up
to 20 days, Esch. coli O1 for 17 days and ADO 2 for 15 days. Sh. dysenteriae 1
was isolated only sporadically to the third day.
