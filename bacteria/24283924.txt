Novel methods for treatment of African trypanosomiasis, caused by infection with 
Trypanosoma brucei are needed. Cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine, 1a) is a powerful
trypanocidal compound in vitro but is ineffective in vivo because of rapid
metabolic degradation by adenosine deaminase (ADA). We elucidated the structural 
moieties of cordycepin required for trypanocidal activity and designed analogues 
that retained trypanotoxicity while gaining resistance to ADA-mediated
metabolism. 2-Fluorocordycepin (2-fluoro-3'-deoxyadenosine, 1b) was identified as
a selective, potent, and ADA-resistant trypanocidal compound that cured T. brucei
infection in mice. Compound 1b is transported through the high affinity TbAT1/P2 
adenosine transporter and is a substrate of T. b. brucei adenosine kinase. 1b has
good preclinical properties suitable for an oral drug, albeit a relatively short 
plasma half-life. We present a rapid and efficient synthesis of 2-halogenated
cordycepins, also useful synthons for the development of additional novel
C2-substituted 3'-deoxyadenosine analogues to be evaluated in development of
experimental therapeutics.
