In a benzene-degrading and sulfate-reducing syntrophic consortium, a clostridium 
affiliated to the genus Pelotomaculum was previously described to ferment benzene
while various sulfate-reducing Deltaproteobacteria and a member of the
Epsilonproteobacteria were supposed to utilize acetate and hydrogen as key
metabolites derived from benzene fermentation. However, the acetate utilization
network within this community was not yet unveiled. In this study, we performed a
pulsed (13)C2-acetate protein stable isotope probing (protein-SIP) approach
continuously spiking low amounts of acetate (10 μM per day) in addition to the
ongoing mineralization of unlabeled benzene. Metaproteomics revealed high
abundances of Clostridiales followed by Syntrophobacterales, Desulfobacterales,
Desulfuromonadales, Desulfovibrionales, Archaeoglobales, and Campylobacterales.
Pulsed acetate protein-SIP results indicated that members of the
Campylobacterales, the Syntrophobacterales, the Archaeoglobales, the
Clostridiales, and the Desulfobacterales were linked to acetate utilization in
descending abundance. The Campylobacterales revealed the fastest and highest
(13)C incorporation. Previous experiments suggested that the activity of the
Campylobacterales was not essential for anaerobic benzene degradation in the
investigated community. However, these organisms were consistently detected in
various hydrocarbon-degrading and sulfate-reducing consortia enriched from the
same aquifer. Here, we demonstrate that this member of the Campylobacterales is
the dominant acetate utilizer in the benzene-degrading microbial consortium.
