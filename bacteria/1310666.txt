We report the primary sequence analyses of two loci, hel and ccl, whose gene
products are required specifically for the biogenesis of c-type cytochromes in
the Gram-negative photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. Genetic and
molecular analyses show that the hel locus contains at least four genes, helA,
helB, helC, and orf52, and the ccl locus contains two genes, ccl1 and ccl2, that 
are essential for cytochromes c biogenesis. HelA is homologous to a class of
proteins called ABC transporters and helA, helB, and helC are proposed to encode 
an export complex. Cytochrome c2-alkaline phosphatase gene fusions were used to
show that apocytochrome c2 synthesis and secretion are not affected by the hel
and ccl defects. Ccl1 and Ccl2 possess typical signal sequences to direct them to
the periplasm. The periplasmic orientation of Ccl1 was confirmed using a
Ccl1-alkaline phosphatase gene fusion. The Ccl1-alkaline phosphatase gene fusion 
analysis also demonstrated that Ccl1 does not require hel genes for its synthesis
and secretion. Ccl1 is homologous to proteins encoded by chloroplast and
mitochondrial genes, suggesting analogous functions in these organelles. Taken
together, these results support the hypothesis that the hel-encoded proteins are 
required for the export of heme to the periplasm where it is subsequently ligated
to the c-type apocytochromes.
