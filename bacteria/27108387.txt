Helicobacter pylori infection is the strongest risk factor for development of
gastric cancer. Host cellular stress responses, including inflammatory and immune
responses, have been reported highly linked to H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis. 
However, whether mitochondrial regulation and metabolic reprogramming, which are 
potently associated with various cancers, play a role in H. pylori-induced
gastric carcinogenesis is largely unknown. Here we revealed that Lon protease
(Lonp1), which is a key inductive of mitochondrial unfolded protein response
(UPR(mt)) and is required to maintain the mitochondrial quality, was greatly
induced in H. pylori infected gastric epithelial cells. Importantly, we uncovered
that knockdown of Lonp1 expression significantly diminished the metabolic switch 
to glycolysis and gastric cell proliferation associated with low multiplicity of 
H. pylori infection. In addition, Lonp1 overexpression in gastric epithelial
cells also promoted glycolytic switch and cell overgrowth, suggesting H. pylori
effect is Lonp1 dependent. We further demonstrated that H. pylori induced Lonp1
expression and cell overgrowth, at least partially, via HIF-1α regulation.
Collectively, our results concluded the relevance of Lonp1 for cell proliferation
and identified Lonp1 as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming in H.
pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis.
