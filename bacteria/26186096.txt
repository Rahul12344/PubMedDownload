A synthetic pathway for (d)-xylose assimilation was stoichiometrically evaluated 
and implemented in Escherichia coli strains. The pathway proceeds via
isomerization of (d)-xylose to (d)-xylulose, phosphorylation of (d)-xylulose to
obtain (d)-xylulose-1-phosphate (X1P), and aldolytic cleavage of the latter to
yield glycolaldehyde and DHAP. Stoichiometric analyses showed that this pathway
provides access to ethylene glycol with a theoretical molar yield of 1.
Alternatively, both glycolaldehyde and DHAP can be converted to glycolic acid
with a theoretical yield that is 20% higher than for the exclusive production of 
this acid via the glyoxylate shunt. Simultaneous expression of xylulose-1 kinase 
and X1P aldolase activities, provided by human ketohexokinase-C and human
aldolase-B, respectively, restored growth of a (d)-xylulose-5-kinase mutant on
xylose. This strain produced ethylene glycol as the major metabolic endproduct.
Metabolic engineering provided strains that assimilated the entire C2 fraction
into the central metabolism or that produced 4.3 g/L glycolic acid at a molar
yield of 0.9 in shake flasks.
