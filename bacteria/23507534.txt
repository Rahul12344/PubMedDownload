MUTYH, a human ortholog of MutY, is a post-replicative DNA glycosylase, highly
conserved throughout evolution, involved in the correction of mismatches
resulting from a faulty replication of the oxidized base 8-hydroxyguanine
(8-oxodG). In particular removal of adenine from A:8-oxodG mispairs by MUTYH
activity is followed by error-free base excision repair (BER) events, leading to 
the formation of C:8-oxodG base pairs. These are the substrate of another BER
enzyme, the OGG1 DNA glycosylase, which then removes 8-oxodG from DNA. Thus the
combined action of OGG1 and MUTYH prevents oxidative damage-induced mutations,
i.e. GC->TA transversions. Germline mutations in MUTYH are associated with a
recessively heritable colorectal polyposis, now referred to as MUTYH-associated
polyposis (MAP). Here we will review the phenotype(s) associated with MUTYH
inactivation from bacteria to mammals, the structure of the MUTYH protein, the
molecular mechanisms of its enzymatic activity and the functional
characterization of MUTYH variants. The relevance of these results will be
discussed to define the role of specific human mutations in colorectal cancer
risk together with the possible role of MUTYH inactivation in sporadic cancer.
