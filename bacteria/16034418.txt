The sub-seafloor biosphere is the largest prokaryotic habitat on Earth but also a
habitat with the lowest metabolic rates. Modelled activity rates are very low,
indicating that most prokaryotes may be inactive or have extraordinarily slow
metabolism. Here we present results from two Pacific Ocean sites, margin and open
ocean, both of which have deep, subsurface stimulation of prokaryotic processes
associated with geochemical and/or sedimentary interfaces. At 90 m depth in the
margin site, stimulation was such that prokaryote numbers were higher (about
13-fold) and activity rates higher than or similar to near-surface values.
Analysis of high-molecular-mass DNA confirmed the presence of viable prokaryotes 
and showed changes in biodiversity with depth that were coupled to geochemistry, 
including a marked community change at the 90-m interface. At the open ocean
site, increases in numbers of prokaryotes at depth were more restricted but also 
corresponded to increased activity; however, this time they were associated with 
repeating layers of diatom-rich sediments (about 9 Myr old). These results show
that deep sedimentary prokaryotes can have high activity, have changing diversity
associated with interfaces and are active over geological timescales.
