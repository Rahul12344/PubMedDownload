OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlated pathogenetic factors and vaginal local
immunity in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC).
METHODS: A case control study was conducted to compare VVC group (60 cases) with 
normal group (60 cases). All of the women filled up the specific questionnaires. 
Routine examination, pH test and bacterial culture were done on the vaginal
discharge. Cytokines of the vaginal lavage were measured by enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: (1) Outcomes of the questionnaires: there was no significant difference 
between the two groups in educational background, knowledge of gynecologic
infection, history of gynecologic infection, hygienic habit, sex life, or use of 
medicine (P > 0.05). The incidence of chronic cervicitis in normal group (43%,
26/60) was higher than in VVC group (22%, 13/60; P < 0.05). (2) There was no
difference in vaginal pH between the two groups (P > 0.05). (3) Detection rate of
candida albicans by vaginal discharge routine examination was 72% (43/60). (4)
The concentrations of interleukin (IL) 2, and IL-4 in vaginal lavage did not show
significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05), but the concentrations 
of human defensin 5, human beta-defensin (HBD) 1, and HBD2 in VVC group [(0.94
+/- 0.44) mg/L, (3.1 +/- 0.4) microg/L, (10 +/- 6) microg/L] were higher than
normal group (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: VVC is a common vulvovaginitis. There is no significant correlation 
between the incidence of VVC and educational background, knowledge of gynecologic
infection, history of gynecologic infection, hygienic habit, sex life, or use of 
medicine in the child-bearing period. Human defensin may be closely correlated
with the pathogenesis of VVC.
