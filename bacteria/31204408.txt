BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diverticulosis of the colon is the most common anatomic
alteration of the human colon, and it is characterized by the out-pouching of the
colonic mucosa and submucosa through the muscular layer. Recurrent abdominal pain
is experienced by about 20% of patients with diverticulosis, and inflammation of 
diverticula may lead to acute diverticulitis. In the past few years, several
studies have investigated the factors predisposing or triggering diverticular
disease (DD) occurrence. Moreover, new physiopathological knowledge has been
acquired. The aim of this study was to review current knowledge regarding the
pathogenesis of DD.
METHODS: A search of PubMed and EMBASE database was performed to identify
articles relevant to the pathogenesis of DD.
RESULTS: Several papers have shown that genetic predisposition, environmental
factors, and colonic dysmotility are implicated in the pathogenesis of DD. More
recent studies have associated specific host immune responses, gut microbiota
imbalance and therefore low-grade inflammation as contributors to symptom
occurrence in DD and diverticulitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Current and evolving evidence highlighted the role of genetic
susceptibility, environment, colonic motility, visceral sensitivity, immune
response, and microbiota in the pathogenesis of this disease. Further studies are
required to identify potential targets for medical or surgical decision-making.
