Elucidation of the linkages between the bacterial community composition and
chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lake ecosystems is critical for
the understanding of the inland water carbon cycling. Despite substantial
research into the relationship between the bacteria community and the bulk DOM
pool, knowledge of the specific relationship between the optical dynamics of DOM 
and the bacterioplankton community in lake ecosystems is still poor. We
investigated the linkages between the optical dynamics of DOM and bacteria
composition in shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. Redundancy Analysis (RDA)
indicated that besides water temperature and phytoplankton biomass, also CDOM was
an important factor determining the composition of the bacterial community.
Generalized Additive Models (GAM) showed that terrestrial humic-like C1 and
tyrosine-like C4 were the key factors explaining the abundance of the main
bacterial clades. C1 was closely correlated with Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria,
Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes, and C4 was closely
related to the latter two and to Bacteroidetes. At family level, the dominant
families - Pelagibacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria) and Gemmataceae
(Planctomycetes) - were related to both allochthonous and autochthonous CDOM
fluorophores but responded differently to the various CDOM components.
Tryptophan-like C2 was significantly and positively correlated with Gemmataceae
and Ellin6075 (Acidobacteria). Additionally, we found that the biomasses of
Cyanophyta, terrestrial humic-like C1, tryptophan-like C4 and C5 were
significantly related to the richness of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Our
results provide new insight into the relationship between bacteria and DOM
optical dynamics although the mechanisms leading to these relationships need
further experimental investigations.
