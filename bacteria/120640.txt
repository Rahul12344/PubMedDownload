Influence of pesticides on the growth of cyanobacteria.

Hutber GN, Rogers LJ, Smith AJ.

Two unicellular and two filamentous cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) were exposed
under conditions optimal for photoautotrophic growth to eleven pesticides. Low
concentrations (0.01 to 5 ppm) of diuron, atrazine, and paraquat inhibited
growth. With MCPA, MCPP, 2,4-D, milstem and ethrel, marked inhibitory effects
were achieved only at concentrations above 100 ppm. Growth was inhibited by
glyphosate, DDT, and thiram at intermediate concentrations. In some cases, the
effective concentration of the pesticide varied considerably with the organism
tested.
