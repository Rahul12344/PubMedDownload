Recent work has identified distinct molecular subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with implications for disease classification and prognosis. NPM1 is one of 
the most common recurrently mutated genes in AML. NPM1 mutations often co-occur
with FLT3-ITDs and mutations in genes regulating DNA methylation, such as DNMT3A,
TET2, and IDH1/2. It remains unclear whether these genetic alterations are
associated with distinct immunophenotypic findings or affect prognosis. We
identified 133 cases of NPM1-mutated AML and correlated sequencing data with
immunophenotypic and clinical findings. Of 84 cases (63%) that lacked monocytic
differentiation ("myeloid AML"), 40 (48%) demonstrated an acute promyelocytic
leukemia-like (APL-like) immunophenotype by flow cytometry, with absence of CD34 
and HLA-DR and strong myeloperoxidase expression, in the absence of a PML-RARA
translocation. Pathologic variants in TET2, IDH1, or IDH2 were identified in
39/40 APL-like cases. This subset of NPM1-mutated AML was associated with longer 
relapse-free and overall survival, when compared with cases that were positive
for CD34 and/or HLA-DR. The combination of NPM1 and TET2 or IDH1/2 mutations
along with an APL-like immunophenotype identifies a distinct subtype of AML.
Further studies addressing its biology and clinical significance may be
especially relevant in the era of IDH inhibitors and recent work showing efficacy
of ATRA therapy in NPM1 and IDH1-mutated AML.
