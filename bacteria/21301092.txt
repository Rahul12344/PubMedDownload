The cysteine protease inhibitor from Ascaris lumbricoides, a roundworm that lives
in the human intestine, may be involved in the suppression of human immune
responses. Here, the molecular cloning, protein expression and purification,
preliminary crystallization and crystallographic characterization of the cysteine
protease inhibitor from A. lumbricoides are reported. The rod-shaped crystal
belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 99.40, b = 37.52, c =
62.92 Å, β = 118.26°. The crystal diffracted to 2.1 Å resolution and contained
two molecules in the asymmetric unit.
