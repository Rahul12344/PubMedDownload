Chemokines have been shown to play a major role in the efficient accumulation and
localization of leukocytes to tissues via interactions with their cognate
receptors. The chemokine/chemokine receptor pairs CCL25/CCR9 and CCL28/CCR10 have
been shown to play a vital role in the trafficking of antibody secreting cells to
mucosal tissues. Although the importance of these chemokines in mediating
effective immune responses is well described, the distribution of these molecules
has not been previously characterized in the cow. In this report we describe the 
mRNA expression patterns of these chemokine/chemokine receptor pairs in the
bovine system. Quantitative mRNA analysis shows that these molecules exhibit
unique expression patterns and suggest that these chemokines play a major role in
the accumulation of receptor bearing cells to specific mucosal tissues.
