Fyn is a Src family protein-tyrosine kinase functionally associated with the
T-cell antigen receptor (TcR)/CD3 receptor complex. We have demonstrated earlier 
that the TcR/CD3-induced activation of Fyn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of
several Fyn-associated proteins, including a protein of 116 kDa. In this report, 
we identify the Fyn-associated 116-kDa phosphoprotein (p116) as c-Cbl. The
identity of p116 has been demonstrated by its specific reactivity with anti-Cbl
and similarity of phosphopeptides generated by V8 proteolysis of phospho-Cbl and 
p116. We demonstrate here that the association of Fyn and c-Cbl is direct and
does not require the presence of other proteins. We also demonstrate that Fyn is 
the Src family kinase that preferentially interacts with c-Cbl in T cells. The
fraction of c-Cbl capable of coprecipitating with Fyn is increased by TcR/CD3
ligation. This increase is likely due to the involvement of Fyn SH2 in the
interactions between Fyn and tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl.
