We report a case with bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis caused by
Streptococcus bovis, developed after colonoscopy, which had a poor outcome and
resulted in evisceration. Bacterial endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare, but
serious ocular disease that occurs when bacteria from a primary focus reach the
eye. It requires a very early diagnosis. A suitable and specific treatment with
intravenous and intravitreal antibiotics may prevent a bad visual prognosis in
some cases.
