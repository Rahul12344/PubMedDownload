OBJECTIVES: To test the bactericidal activity of human beta-defensins (hBDs) 2
and 3 against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella
strains.
METHODS: Thirty-six Klebsiella pneumoniae and seventeen Klebsiella oxytoca
ESBL-producing isolates from nosocomial infections were tested. The bactericidal 
activity of recombinantly synthesized hBD-2 and -3 was tested and the results
were given either as lethal doses killing > or = 90% of bacteria (LD90s) or as
MBCs (> or = 99.9% killing).
RESULTS: Except for one intermediately susceptible strain (MBC = 25 mg/L), all
other ESBL-producing strains were highly susceptible to both defensins (LD90s and
MBCs < or = 12.5 mg/L).
CONCLUSIONS: The results underline the high efficacy of hBD-2 and -3 against
ESBL-producing Klebsiella, making both defensins attractive candidates as
antimicrobial agents to combat these increasingly troublesome bacteria.
