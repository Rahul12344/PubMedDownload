Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with molecular 
imaging agents would allow for the specific localization of brain tumors. Prior
studies using T 1-weighted MR imaging demonstrated that the SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 
molecular imaging agent labeled heterotopic xenograft models of brain tumors more
intensely than non-specific contrast agents using conventional T 1-weighted
imaging techniques. In this study, we used a dynamic quantitative T 1 mapping
strategy to more objectively compare intra-tumoral retention of the
SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 agent over time in comparison to non-targeted control
agents. Our results demonstrate that the targeted SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 agent, a
scrambled-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 control agent, and the non-specific clinical contrast
agent Optimark(â„¢) all enhanced flank tumors of human glioma cells with similar
maximal changes on T 1 mapping. However, the retention of the agents differs. The
non-specific agents show significant recovery within 20 min by an increase in T 1
while the specific agent SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 is retained in the tumors and shows
little recovery over 60 min. The retention effect is demonstrated by percent
change in T 1 values and slope calculations as well as by calculations of
gadolinium concentration in tumor compared to muscle. Quantitative T 1 mapping
demonstrates the superior binding and retention in tumors of the
SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 agent over time compared to the non-specific contrast agent 
currently in clinical use.
