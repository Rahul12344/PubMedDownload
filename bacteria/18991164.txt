OBJECTIVE: Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric inflammation is dependent on the
persistence of the microorganism in the gastric epithelium. Modulation of the
host epithelial antimicrobial responses may be a critical determinant in H.
pylori-induced gastritis. Human beta-defensins (hBDs) are important components of
the host defence at mucosal surfaces. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the relevance of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 
human beta defensin-1 (hBD-1) gene in H. pylori-induced gastritis and to assess
the mRNA expression of hBD-1 in H. pylori-infected AGS cells.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three SNPs of the beta defensin DEFB1 gene, DEFB1 G-20A
(rs11362), DEFB1 C-44G (rs1800972) and DEFB1 G-52A (rs1799946), were genotyped
either by Custom TaqMan SNP genotyping assays or by restriction fragment length
polymorphism (RFLP) in 150 patients with chronic active gastritis; 100
serologically H. pylori-positive subjects without gastric or duodenal symptoms
served as controls. hBD-1 mRNA expression in AGS cells was measured by
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Significant differences in frequencies of the GA and AA genotypes of
G-52A SNPs were observed between patients with chronic active gastritis and
healthy controls. The maximum level of hBD-1 mRNA expression in AGS cells was
observed at 24 h after infection with H. pylori, this not being dependent on the 
presence of the cag pathogenicity island (PAI).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these genetic and in vitro experiments suggest that
not only the inducible, but also the constitutive form of hBD may be important in
the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced gastritis.
