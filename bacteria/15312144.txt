A DNA vaccine based on the heat-shock protein 65 Mycobacterium leprae gene
(pHSP65) presented a prophylactic and therapeutic effect in an experimental model
of tuberculosis. In this paper, we addressed the question of which protective
mechanisms are activated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected mice after immune
therapy with pHSP65. We evaluated activation of the cellular immune response in
the lungs of infected mice 30 days after infection (initiation of immune therapy)
and in those of uninfected mice. After 70 days (end of immune therapy), the
immune responses of infected untreated mice, infected pHSP65-treated mice and
infected pCDNA3-treated mice were also evaluated. Our results show that the most 
significant effect of pHSP65 was the stimulation of CD8+ lung cell activation,
interferon-gamma recovery and reduction of lung injury. There was also partial
restoration of the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha. Treatment with
pcDNA3 vector also induced an immune stimulatory effect. However, only infected
pHSP65-treated mice were able to produce significant levels of interferon-gamma
and to restrict the growth of bacilli.
