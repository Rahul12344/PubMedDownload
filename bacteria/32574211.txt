Efforts at host-directed therapy of tuberculosis have produced little control of 
the disease in experimental animals to date. This is not surprising, given that
few specific host targets have been validated, and reciprocally, many of the
compounds tested potentially impact multiple targets with both beneficial and
detrimental consequences. This puts a premium on identifying appropriate
molecular targets and subjecting them to more selective modulation. We discovered
an aminopyrimidine small molecule, 2062, that had no direct antimycobacterial
activity, but synergized with rifampin to reduce bacterial burden in Mtb infected
macrophages and mice and also dampened lung immunopathology. We used 2062 and its
inactive congeners as tool compounds to identify host targets. By biochemical,
pharmacologic, transcriptomic and genetic approaches, we found that 2062's
beneficial effects on Mtb control and clearance in macrophages and in mice are
associated with activation of transcription factor EB via an organellar stress
response. 2062-dependent TFEB activation led to improved autophagy, lysosomal
acidification and lysosomal degradation, promoting bacterial clearance in
macrophages. Deletion of TFEB resulted in the loss of IFNÎ³-dependent control of
Mtb replication in macrophages. 2062 also targeted multiple kinases, such as
PIKfyve, VPS34, JAKs and Tyk2, whose inhibition likely limited 2062's efficacy in
vivo. These findings support a search for selective activators of TFEB for HDT of
TB.
