Small ubiquitin-related modifier-2/3 (SUMO-2/3) is a member of the ubiquitin-like
(Ubl) protein family. Conjugation of SUMO-2/3 to target proteins is influenced by
various stress conditions and chemical inhibitors. SUMO-2/3 conjugation may serve
as a neuroprotective mechanism and may play a role in protein quality control. A 
method for screening global changes in SUMO-2/3 conjugation would facilitate
further research of SUMO-2/3 cellular function. Here we show that dot blot with
immunochemical detection allows evaluation of changes in global cellular SUMO-2/3
conjugation and offers an alternative to more laborious Western blot analysis.
The method is based on a change of SUMO-2/3 signal intensity upon its
conjugation. The dot blot analysis presented here is a time-saving method that
enables screening of large numbers of samples and easy statistical evaluation of 
the results.
