Muraymycins are a subclass of antimicrobially active uridine-derived natural
products. Biological data on several muraymycin analogues have been reported,
including some inhibitory in vitro activities toward their target protein, the
bacterial membrane enzyme MraY. However, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) 
study on naturally occurring muraymycins based on such in vitro data has been
missing so far. In this work, we report a detailed SAR investigation on
representatives of the four muraymycin subgroups A-D using a fluorescence-based
in vitro MraY assay. For some muraymycins, inhibition of MraY with IC50 values in
the low-picomolar range was observed. These inhibitory potencies were compared
with antibacterial activities and were correlated to modelling data derived from 
a previously reported X-ray crystal structure of MraY in complex with a
muraymycin inhibitor. Overall, these results will pave the way for the
development of muraymycin analogues with optimized properties as antibacterial
drug candidates.
