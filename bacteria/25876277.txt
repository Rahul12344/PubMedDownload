Prevalence, virulence gene distribution and genetic diversity of Arcobacter in
food samples in Germany.

This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in food
samples in Germany. In addition, the presence of putative virulence genes and the
genetic diversity was tested for Arcobacter (A.) butzleri strains isolated during
this study. The prevalence of Arcobacter spp. was 34% in fish meat, 26.8% in
poultry meat and 2% in minced meat (beef and pork). All investigated A. butzleri 
isolates carried the genes cadF, ciaB, cj1349, mviN and pldA. The gene tlyA was
detectable in 97.5% of the strains. Lower detection rates were observed for hecA 
(47.5%), hecB (45%), iroE (40%) and irgA (35%). Genotyping by ERIC-PCR
demonstrated a high genetic diversity of A. butzleri strains from different
foods. In conclusion, this study shows that about one third of fish meat and
poultry meat samples contained Arcobacter spp. These data highlight the need to
strengthen our effort to elucidate the importance ofArcobacter on veterinary
public health.
