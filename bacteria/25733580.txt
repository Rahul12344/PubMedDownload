Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by a single point mutation in the
seventh codon of the β-globin gene. Site-specific correction of the sickle
mutation in hematopoietic stem cells would allow for permanent production of
normal red blood cells. Using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to flank the 
sickle mutation, we demonstrate efficient targeted cleavage at the β-globin locus
with minimal off-target modification. By co-delivering a homologous donor
template (either an integrase-defective lentiviral vector or a DNA
oligonucleotide), high levels of gene modification were achieved in CD34(+)
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Modified cells maintained their ability 
to engraft NOD/SCID/IL2rγ(null) mice and to produce cells from multiple lineages,
although with a reduction in the modification levels relative to the in vitro
samples. Importantly, ZFN-driven gene correction in CD34(+) cells from the bone
marrow of patients with SCD resulted in the production of wild-type hemoglobin
tetramers.
