OBJECTIVES: Enamel matrix derivative (EMD) is used clinically to promote
periodontal tissue regeneration, however, there are few reports regarding effects
of EMD on bone metabolism. We evaluated the influence of EMD on osteoclast
formation using in vitro bone marrow culture.
METHODS: Bioactive fractions were purified from EMD by reverse-phase HPLC on a
C18 hydrophobic support, then mouse bone marrow cells were cultured with EMD or
its purified fractions for 8 days. Following tartrate resistant acid phosphatase 
(TRAP) staining, TRAP-positive multinucleated cells were counted. The expression 
of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) in osteoblastic cells was
detected using immunoblotting.
RESULTS: EMD was dissolved in 0.1% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid and applied to 
a C18 column for HPLC. Two major peaks were obtained of which the second
(fraction numbers 21-25) was found to induce the formation of osteoclasts in
mouse marrow cultures. Further, osteoprotegerin completely inhibited osteoclast
formation in mouse marrow cultures with or without osteoblastic stromal cells,
when being cultured with EMD or its purified fractions. In addition, Western blot
analysis revealed the presence of RANKL in mouse osteoblastic cells stimulated
with EMD or its purified fractions.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that EMD induces the formation of osteoclasts
through RANKL expressed by osteoblastic cells, and suggest that EMD may regulate 
both bone formation and bone resorption during periodontal tissue regeneration.
