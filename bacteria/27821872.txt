Glycolipids are potent activator of natural killer T (NKT) cells. The
relationship between NKT cells and intestinal bacterial glycolipids in liver
disorders remained unclear. We found that, in sharp contrast to specific
pathogen-free (SPF) mice, germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to Concanavalin A
(ConA)-induced liver injury. ConA treatment failed to trigger the activation of
hepatic NKT cells in GF mice. These defects correlated with the sharply reduced
levels of CD1d-presented glycolipid antigens in ConA-treated GF mice compared
with SPF counterparts. Nevertheless, CD1d expression was similar between these
two kinds of mice. The absence of intestinal bacteria did not affect the
incidence of Î±GalCer-induced liver injury in GF mice. Importantly, we found the
intestinal bacteria contain glycolipids which can be presented by CD1d and
recognized by NKT cells. Furthermore, supplement of killed intestinal bacteria
was able to restore ConA-mediated NKT cell activation and liver injury in GF
mice. Our results suggest that glycolipid antigens derived from intestinal
commensal bacteria are important hepatic NKT cell agonist and these antigens are 
required for the activation of NKT cells during ConA-induced liver injury. These 
finding provide a mechanistic explanation for the capacity of intestinal
microflora to control liver inflammation.
