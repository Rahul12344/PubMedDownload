Human beta-defensin-2 (HBD-2) is a cysteine-rich cationic low molecular weight
antimicrobial peptide recently discovered in psoriatic lesional skin. It is
produced by a number of epithelial cells and exhibits potent antimicrobial
activity against Gram-negative bacteria and Candida, but not Gram-positive
Staphylococcus aureus. HBD-2 represents the first human defensin that is produced
following stimulation of epithelial cells by contact with microorganisms such as 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa or cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta. The HBD-2
gene and protein are locally expressed in keratinocytes associated with
inflammatory skin lesions such as psoriasis as well as in the infected lung
epithelia of patients with cystic fibrosis. It is intriguing to speculate that
HBD-2 is a dynamic component of the local epithelial defense system of the skin
and respiratory tract having a role to protect surfaces from infection, and
providing a possible reason why skin and lung infections with Gram-negative
bacteria are rather rare.
