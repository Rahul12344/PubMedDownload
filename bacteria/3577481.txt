Clinical features of early erythema migrans disease and related disorders.

Weber K, Neubert U.

104 patients with erythema migrans disease (EMD), 7 patients with borrelia
lymphocytoma (BL), and 21 patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA)
were prospectively followed for a median of 20, 14, and 12 months, respectively. 
99 patients with EMD and 6 with BL were treated with antibiotics early for their 
illness. 72 patients with EMD had 1 to 10 constitutional symptoms besides the
erythema migrans, 32 had erythema migrans alone, and a child with BL had
urticaria. Out of 39 patients with EMD, 23 acquired arthralgia, 18 signs and
symptoms consistent with neurologic manifestations and 8 with cardiac involvement
before or after therapy. 4 patients with EMD and 1 with BL had up to 10 multiple 
erythema migrans lesions. 3 patients with EMD experienced a reinfection and 1
with ACA a relapse. Several patients with ACA developed signs and symptoms
consistent with neurologic, cardiac and joint involvement, and 2 had a history of
EMD. Elevated antibody titers against Borrelia burgdorferi were present in 48% of
69 patients with EMD, 5 with BL and 11 with ACA, and in 93% of another group with
EMD, 2 with BL and 10 with ACA, when tested against other borreliae. Increased
values of the ESR, IgG, IgA and IgM were found in more patients with ACA than
with EMD. The median of IgA and IgM was significantly higher in ACA than in EMD. 
Borreliae were found in brain and liver of a newborn. Early EMD appears to be
quite similar to early Lyme disease.
