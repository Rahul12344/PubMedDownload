A novel gammaproteobacterial methanotroph; strain FWC3 was isolated from a
tropical freshwater wetland sample collected near a beach in Western India.
Strain FWC3 forms flesh pink/peach colored colonies, is non-motile, and the cells
are present as diplococci, triads, tetracocci and aggregates. Strain FWC3 grows
only on methane and methanol. As the 16S rRNA gene of strain FWC3 showed low
similarities with other Type I methanotrophs (less than 94.3%), it was further
investigated for its novelty and characterisation by a polyphasic approach. ANI
indices and DDH values deduced from the draft genome of strain FWC3
(SEYW00000000.1) with the other nearest type strains (Methylocaldum marinum S8T
and Methylococcus capsulatus BathT) were ~ 70% and ~ 15%, respectively. The low
level similarities indicated that strain FWC3 can belong to a new genus and
species. Additionally, strain FWC3 showed a unique fatty acid profile with the
dominance of C16:1 ω7 and ω6c, C16:0 and C16:1 ω9c. During the characterisation
of strain FWC3, a morphologically similar methanotroph, strain C50C1 was
described (Ghashghavi et al. in mSphere 4:e00631-18, 2019) and named as
'Methylotetracoccus oryzae'. We found that strain FWC3 and strain C50C1 belonged 
to the same genus but could belong to different species based on the ANI indices 
and dDDH values (~ 94% and ~ 55%, respectively). However, strain C50C1 has not
been deposited in two culture collections and not been validly described. Also,
the 16S rRNA gene of strain C50C1 is neither available on the database nor can it
be retrieved from the genome assembly. Based on the polyphasic characterisation
and comparison to the other type strains of Methylococcaceae, we propose strain
FWC3 (= JCM 33786T, = KCTC 72733T, = MCC 4198T) to be the type strain of a novel 
genus and species, for which the name Methylolobus aquaticus is proposed. Strain 
C50C1 (Ghashghavi et al. 2019) could represent another species ('Methylolobus
oryzae').
