The protein products of proto-oncogenes implicated in T cell acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia include two distinct families of presumptive transcription factors.
RBTN1 and RBTN2 encode highly related proteins that possess cysteine-rich LIM
motifs. TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1 encode a unique subgroup of basic helix-loop-helix
(bHLH) proteins that share exceptional homology in their bHLH sequences. We have 
found that RBTN1 and RBTN2 have the ability to interact with each of the
leukemogenic bHLH proteins (TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1). These interactions occur in
vivo and appear to be mediated by sequences within the LIM and bHLH domains. The 
LIM-bHLH interactions are highly specific in that RBTN1 and RBTN2 will associate 
with TAL1, TAL2 and LYL1, but not with other bHLH proteins, including E12, E47,
Id1, NHLH1, AP4, MAX, MYC and MyoD1. Moreover, RBTN1 and RBTN2 can interact with 
TAL1 polypeptides that exist in assembled bHLH heterodimers (e.g. TAL1-E47),
suggesting that the RBTN proteins can influence the functional properties of
TAL1. Finally, we have identified a subset of leukemia patients that harbor
tumor-specific rearrangements of both their RBTN2 and TAL1 genes. Thus, the
activated alleles of these genes may promote leukemia cooperatively, perhaps as a
result of bHLH-LIM interactions between their protein products.
