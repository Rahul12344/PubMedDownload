50 sera each from women with infertility, bad obstetric history and healthy
pregnant women were tested for the presence of antichlamydial IgG antibodies.
Antichlamydial IgG antibodies were present in 68% of women with infertility, 50% 
of women with bad obstetric history and 10% in healthy pregnant women. As culture
methods are cumbersome so diagnosis can be made by serological tests, which are
sensitive, specific and non invasive. Chlamydia trachohmatis is one of the most
common bacterial sexually transmitted disease and most infections caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis being asymptomatic, result in a large reservoir of
unrecognized, infected individuals capable of transmitting the infection to
sexual partners. Chlamydia trachomatis if detected earlier and given proper
treatment, can minimize the complications in these patients.
