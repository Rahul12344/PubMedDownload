Overexpression of B7 and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on syngeneic 
cells triggered MHC-unrestricted lysis by MHC-restricted CD8+ CTL without TCR/CD3
engagement. Both CD28/B7 and LFA-1/ICAM-1 interactions were required for
MHC-nonrestricted cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was measured in 4-h and 16- to 18-h 
cytotoxicity assays. B7-ICAM-1 overexpression triggered perforin- and Fas
ligand-mediated lysis, while TNF-alpha was not elicited in MHC-unrestricted
cytotoxicity. These results suggest that target cells may elicit MHC-unrestricted
lysis from CTL through up-regulation of membrane adherence and costimulatory
receptors.
