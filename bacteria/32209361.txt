Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with physiological changes commonly
observed with increasing age, such as inflammation and impaired immune function. 
Age-related impaired adaptive immunity is characterized by the loss of naive
T-cells and the reciprocal accumulation of memory T-cells together with the loss 
of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules. Additionally, the presence and activity of
cytomegalovirus (CMV) alters the architecture of the T-cell compartment in a
manner consistent with premature aging. Because CMV is also thought to reactivate
with psychological stress, this study tested whether MDD influences age-related
phenotypes of T-cell populations in the context of CMV infection in young and
middle-aged adults. Morning blood samples from volunteers with a DSM-IV diagnosis
of MDD (n = 98, mean age(SD) = 36(10) years, 74.5% female, 57.1% CMV+) and
comparison controls (n = 98, mean age(SD) = 34(10) years, 68.4% female, 51.0%
CMV+) were evaluated for CMV IgG antibody status and the distribution of late
differentiated (CD27-CD28-) cells within CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets, i.e. naive
(CCR7+CD45RA+), effector memory (EM, CCR7-CD45RA-), central memory (CM,
CCR7+CD45RA-) and effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA,
CCR7-CD45RA+). Mixed linear regression models controlling for age, sex, ethnicity
and flow cytometry batch showed that CMV seropositivity was associated with a
reduction in naive T-cells, expansion of EMRA T-cells, and a greater percent
distribution of CD27-CD28- cells within CD4+ and CD8+ memory T-cell subsets
(p's < 0.004), but there was no significant effect of MDD, nor any significant
interaction between CMV and diagnosis. Unexpectedly, depressed men were less
likely to be CMV+ and depressed women were more likely to be CMV+ than
sex-matched controls suggesting a possible interaction between sex and MDD on CMV
susceptibility, but this three-way interaction did not significantly affect the
T-cell subtypes. Our findings suggest that depression in young and middle-aged
adults does not prematurely advance aging of the T-cell compartment independently
of CMV, but there may be significant sex-specific effects on adaptive immunity
that warrant further investigation.
