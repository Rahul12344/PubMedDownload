The pulmonary airways are continuously exposed to bacteria. As a first line of
defense against infection, the airway surface liquid (ASL) contains a complex
mixture of antimicrobial factors that kill inhaled and aspirated bacteria. The
composition of ASL is critical for antimicrobial effectiveness. For example, in
cystic fibrosis an abnormally acidic ASL inhibits antimicrobial activity. Here,
we tested the effect of pH on the activity of an ASL defensin, human β-defensin-3
(hBD-3), and the cathelicidin-related peptide, LL-37. We found that reducing pH
from 8.0 to 6.8 reduced the ability of both peptides to kill Staphylococcus
aureus. An acidic pH also attenuated LL-37 killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In 
addition, we discovered synergism between hBD-3 and LL-37 in killing S. aureus.
LL-37 and lysozyme were also synergistic. Importantly, an acidic pH reduced the
synergistic effects of combinations of ASL antibacterials. These results indicate
that an acidic pH reduces the activity of individual ASL antimicrobials, impairs 
synergism between them, and thus may disrupt an important airway host defense
mechanism.
