Multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor is a recently described
seizure-associated entity with overlapping features of a malformative and
neoplastic process. We report a case of multinodular and vacuolating neuronal
tumor in a 29-year-old man with a history of recent headaches and complex partial
seizures. Neuroimaging revealed a nonenhancing, T2 and T2 fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery hyperintense multinodular lesion in the right temporal lobe.
Lesional tissue demonstrated well-demarcated nodules of ganglioid cells with
vacuolation of both the perikarya and the fibrillary neuropil-like background.
The ganglioid cells showed weak cytoplasmic reactivity for synaptophysin and were
nonreactive for neurofilament and chromogranin. CD34-positive stellate cells were
present within the nodules. A 50-gene next-generation sequencing panel did not
identify any somatic mutations in genomic DNA extracted from the tumor.
