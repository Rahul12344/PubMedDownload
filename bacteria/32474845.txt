Successful pathogenicity often resulted from a complicated association between
virulence and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the relationship between the
las system and antibiotic resistance. Seventy-three (73) P. aeruginosa isolates
were collected from burn wounds (26.02%), blood cultures (30.13%), catheters
(12.32%), and urine culture (31.50%). Among the 73 collected isolates, 22
isolates were considered as multi-drug resistant (MDR) and 11 isolates as
extensively-drug resistant (XDR). Furthermore, phenazines and LasA protease were 
detected among 21.91% and 32.87% of isolates, respectively. Quantitative
real-time PCR assessment of KPC, MBL, and lasI/R indicated that resistance and
virulence factors are more expressed in XDR strains than MDR strains. Also, the
expression level of KPC and MBL reduced in non-biofilm forming strains. However, 
increased expression levels of lasI, lasR, and the KPC genes were observed in
LasA and LasB protease producing strains. Interestingly, 16 known sequence types 
(including ST108, ST260, ST217) and three novel STs (ST2452, ST2427, and ST2542) 
were characterized among the collected isolates, which are related to the
virulence and resistance. In MDR-XDR strains, a strong correlation between lasI/R
and the variants of antibiotic resistance genes was found. In conclusion, the
pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa may increase the prevalence of
antibiotic-resistant strains.
