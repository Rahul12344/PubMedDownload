OBJECTIVE: To study whether estrogen receptors (ERs) are expressed in vitro and
in vivo by female circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs); and the role
of ERs in the periodic vascular damage and repair that occurs during the
menstrual cycle.
DESIGN: Quantification of circulating progenitor cells, EPCs, and relative CXCR4+
fraction by flow cytometry. Quantification of plasma 17beta-E(2) by
electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. Expression of ERs by immunofluorescence and 
immunohistochemistry. Estrogen receptor, CXCR4, and matrix metalloproteinase 9
gene expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and real-time 
polymerase chain reaction.
SETTING: University clinic and academic research laboratory.
PATIENT(S): Twelve young fertile women (aged 22-27 years) observed for 6 months, 
10 postmenopausal women (aged 52-63 years), and 50 male control subjects (aged
24-61 years).
INTERVENTION(S): Blood (35 mL) was collected at each observation point.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Correlation between 17beta-E(2) exposure and
neoangiogenesis markers.
RESULT(S): Estrogen receptors are expressed both in cultured EPCs after prolonged
estrogen stimulation and in circulating EPCs, such as in CD34+ cells in bone
marrow. The number of ER-beta+ and CXCR4+ EPCs increased during the ovulatory
phase, and this increase is probably mediated by ER-beta and matrix
metalloproteinase 9.
CONCLUSION(S): Estrogens play a key role in neoangiogenesis processes, such as
endometrium recovery, and this mechanism involves both a central action (on bone 
marrow) and a cytokine-mediated peripheral one (on endothelium).
