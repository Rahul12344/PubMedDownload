One of the main fundamental mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative 
bacteria comprises an effective change in the membrane permeability to
antibiotics. The Gram-negative bacterial complex cell envelope comprises an outer
membrane that delimits the periplasm from the exterior environment. The outer
membrane contains numerous protein channels, termed as porins or nanopores, which
are mainly involved in the influx of hydrophilic compounds, including
antibiotics. Bacterial adaptation to reduce influx through these outer membrane
proteins (Omps) is one of the crucial mechanisms behind antibiotic resistance.
Thus to interpret the molecular basis of the outer membrane permeability is the
current challenge. This review attempts to develop a state of knowledge pertinent
to Omps and their effective role in antibiotic influx. Further, it aims to study 
the bacterial response to antibiotic membrane permeability and hopefully provoke 
a discussion toward understanding and further exploration of prospects to improve
our knowledge on physicochemical parameters that direct the translocation of
antibiotics through the bacterial membrane protein channels.
