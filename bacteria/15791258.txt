CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that
express a conserved T-cell receptor and contribute to host defence against
various microbial pathogens. However, their target lipid antigens have remained
elusive. Here we report evidence for microbial, antigen-specific activation of
NKT cells against Gram-negative, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-negative
alpha-Proteobacteria such as Ehrlichia muris and Sphingomonas capsulata. We have 
identified glycosylceramides from the cell wall of Sphingomonas that serve as
direct targets for mouse and human NKT cells, controlling both septic shock
reaction and bacterial clearance in infected mice. In contrast, Gram-negative,
LPS-positive Salmonella typhimurium activates NKT cells through the recognition
of an endogenous lysosomal glycosphingolipid, iGb3, presented by LPS-activated
dendritic cells. These findings identify two novel antigenic targets of NKT cells
in antimicrobial defence, and show that glycosylceramides are an alternative to
LPS for innate recognition of the Gram-negative, LPS-negative bacterial cell
wall.
