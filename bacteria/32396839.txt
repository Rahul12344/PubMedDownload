Comment in
    Trends Parasitol. 2020 Aug;36(8):651-653.

Liver-resident memory CD8+ T (TRM) cells remain in and constantly patrol the
liver to elicit rapid immunity upon antigen encounter and can mediate efficient
protection against liver-stage Plasmodium infection. This finding has prompted
the development of immunization strategies where T cells are activated in the
spleen and then trapped in the liver to form TRM cells. Here, we identify
PbRPL6120-127, a H2-Kb-restricted epitope from the putative 60S ribosomal protein
L6 (RPL6) of Plasmodium berghei ANKA, as an optimal antigen for endogenous liver 
TRM cell generation and protection against malaria. A single dose vaccination
targeting RPL6 provided effective and prolonged sterilizing immunity against high
dose sporozoite challenges. Expressed throughout the parasite life cycle, across 
Plasmodium species, and highly conserved, RPL6 exhibits strong translation
potential as a vaccine candidate. This is further advocated by the identification
of a broadly conserved, immunogenic HLA-A∗02:01-restricted epitope in
P. falciparum RPL6.
