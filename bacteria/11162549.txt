Intensive use of corticosteroids may be accompanied by increased susceptibility
to infections; hence, we investigated the effects of dexamethasone on the
expression of antimicrobial peptides, termed human beta-defensins (hBD), by
cultured bronchial epithelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes. The results
revealed that dexamethasone inhibited the (stimulated) expression of mRNA for
hBD-3, but not hBD-1 and hBD-2 by these epithelial cells. Dexamethasone did not
affect the (stimulated) mRNA expression of hBD-1 and hBD-2 by mononuclear
phagocytes, whereas these cells did not express hBD-3 mRNA.
