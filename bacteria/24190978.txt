BACKGROUND: The presence of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is
associated with prolonged survival in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and
other epithelial cancers. Survival is most strongly associated with
intraepithelial versus intrastromal CD8(+) TILs; however, the mechanisms that
promote the intraepithelial localization of TILs remain poorly understood. We
hypothesized that intraepithelial CD8(+) TILs, like normal mucosal
intraepithelial lymphocytes, might express CD103, a subunit of αE/β7 integrin,
which binds E-cadherin on epithelial cells.
METHODS: A large collection of primary ovarian tumors (HGSC, endometrioid,
mucinous, and clear cell) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry for the presence
of TIL-expressing CD103. The activation and differentiation status of CD103(+)
TILs were assessed by flow cytometry. The prognostic significance of TIL subsets 
was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: CD103(+) TILs were present in all major ovarian cancer subtypes and were
most abundant in HGSC. CD103(+) TILs were preferentially localized to epithelial 
regions of tumors and were comprised predominantly of CD8(+) T cells expressing
activation (HLA-DR, Ki-67, PD-1) and cytolytic (TIA-1) markers, as well as
CD56(+) NK cells. Tumor infiltration by CD103(+) TILs was strongly associated
with patient survival in HGSC. Tumors containing CD8(+) TILs that were CD103(-)
showed poor prognosis equivalent to tumors lacking CD8(+) TILs altogether.
CONCLUSIONS: CD103(+) TILs comprise intraepithelial, activated CD8(+) T cells,
and NK cells and are strongly associated with patient survival in HGSC. CD103 may
serve as a useful marker for enriching the most beneficial subsets of TILs for
immunotherapy.
