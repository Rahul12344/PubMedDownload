IFN-γ mediates chemically induced skin inflammation; however, the mechanism by
which IFN-γ-producing cells are recruited to the sites of inflammation remains
undefined. Secretion of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a
proinflammatory cytokine, from damaged cells may promote immune cell recruitment.
We hypothesized that MIF triggers an initial step in the chemotaxis of
IFN-γ-producing cells in chemically induced skin inflammation. Using acute and
chronic models of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin
inflammation in mouse ears, MIF expression was examined, and its role in this
process was investigated pharmacologically. The cell populations targeted by MIF,
their receptor expression patterns, and the effects of MIF on cell migration were
examined. TPA directly caused cytotoxicity accompanied by MIF release in mouse
ear epidermal keratinocytes, as well as in human keratinocytic HaCaT cells.
Treatment with the MIF antagonist
(S,R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazole acetic acid methyl ester
considerably attenuated TPA-induced ear swelling, leukocyte infiltration,
epidermal cell proliferation, and dermal angiogenesis. Inhibition of MIF greatly 
diminished the dermal infiltration of IFN-γ(+) NKT cells, whereas the addition of
exogenous TPA and MIF to NKT cells promoted their IFN-γ production and migration,
respectively. MIF specifically triggered the chemotaxis of NKT cells via CD74 and
CXCR2, and the resulting depletion of NKT cells abolished TPA-induced skin
inflammation. In TPA-induced skin inflammation, MIF is released from damaged
keratinocytes and then triggers the chemotaxis of CD74(+)CXCR2(+) NKT cells for
IFN-γ production.
