The DAN family, including Gremlin-1 and Gremlin-2 (Grem1 and Grem2), represents a
large family of secreted BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) antagonists. However,
how DAN proteins specifically inhibit BMP signaling has remained elusive. Here,
we report the structure of Grem2 bound to GDF5 at 2.9-Å resolution. The structure
reveals two Grem2 dimers binding perpendicularly to each GDF5 monomer, resembling
an H-like structure. Comparison to the unbound Grem2 structure reveals a dynamic 
N terminus that undergoes significant transition upon complex formation, leading 
to simultaneous interaction with the type I and type II receptor motifs on GDF5. 
Binding studies show that DAN-family members can interact with BMP-type I
receptor complexes, whereas Noggin outcompetes the type I receptor for ligand
binding. Interestingly, Grem2-GDF5 forms a stable aggregate-like structure
in vitro that is not clearly observed for other antagonists, including Noggin and
Follistatin. These findings exemplify the structural and functional diversity
across the various BMP antagonist families.
