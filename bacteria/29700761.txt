Molecular tests may enable early adjustment of antimicrobial therapy and be
complementary to blood culture (BC) which has imperfect sensitivity in critically
ill patients. We evaluated a novel multiplex real-time PCR assay to diagnose
bloodstream pathogens directly in whole blood samples (BSI-PCR). BSI-PCR included
11 species- and four genus-specific PCRs, a molecular Gram-stain PCR, and two
antibiotic resistance markers. We collected 5Â mL blood from critically ill
patients simultaneously with clinically indicated BC. Microbial DNA was isolated 
using the Polaris method followed by automated DNA extraction. Sensitivity and
specificity were calculated using BC as reference. BSI-PCR was evaluated in 347
BC-positive samples (representing up to 50 instances of each pathogen covered by 
the test) and 200 BC-negative samples. Bacterial species-specific PCR
sensitivities ranged from 65 to 100%. Sensitivity was 26% for the Gram-positive
PCR, 32% for the Gram-negative PCR, and ranged 0 to 7% for yeast PCRs. Yeast
detection was improved to 40% in a smaller set-up. There was no overall
association between BSI-PCR sensitivity and time-to-positivity of BC (which was
highly variable), yet Ct-values were lower for true-positive versus
false-positive PCR results. False-positive results were observed in 84 (4%) of
the 2200 species-specific PCRs in 200 culture-negative samples, and ranged from 0
to 6% for generic PCRs. Sensitivity of BSI-PCR was promising for individual
bacterial pathogens, but still insufficient for yeasts and generic PCRs. Further 
development of BSI-PCR will focus on improving sensitivity by increasing input
volumes and on subsequent implementation as a bedside test.
