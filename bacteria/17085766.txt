OBJECTIVES: Analyse a series of halogenated 3-deaza-adenosine analogues for
efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra and determine if adenosine
(Ado) kinase plays a role in the mechanism of action of these compounds.
METHODS: The MIC as determined by microdilution broth assay provided a measure of
antitubercular efficacy. MIC values were measured in M. tuberculosis strains
H37Ra, SRICK1 (an Ado kinase-deficient strain of M. tuberculosis derived from
H37Ra) and SRICK1 complemented with adoK, the gene which codes for Ado kinase in 
M. tuberculosis, in order to determine if Ado kinase played a role in the
mechanism of action of these compounds. Furthermore, each compound was analysed
as both a substrate and inhibitor for purified Ado kinases from M. tuberculosis
and human sources.
RESULTS: 2-Fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine, 3-fluoro-3-deaza-adenosine and
2,3-difluoro-3-deaza-adenosine exhibited antitubercular activity that was Ado
kinase-dependent. Furthermore, these compounds were at least 10-fold better
substrates for M. tuberculosis Ado kinase than the human homologue.
CONCLUSIONS: The Ado kinase-dependent antitubercular activity exhibited by
several of the halogenated 3-deaza-adenosine analogues investigated in this study
warrants further investigation of these compounds as antitubercular agents.
Furthermore, substrate and inhibition studies provided insight into the
Ado-binding domain of Ado kinase, indicating that steric hindrance may limit the 
size of exocyclic modifications at the 3-position of Ado.
