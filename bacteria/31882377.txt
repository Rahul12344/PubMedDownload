PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The prognosis of patients with relapsed/refractory
precursor B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is dismal. Antibody-based
therapies, such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamycin (IO) have led to
improved outcomes. The impact of prior immunotherapy on chimeric antigen receptor
(CAR) T-Cell therapeutic efficacy and toxicity is unknown.
METHODS: We describe a case series of ALL patients with prior exposure to
blinatumomab or IO, who were treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells with CD28
co-stimulatory domain (NCT02772198). We then review the literature on CAR-T post 
antibody-based therapy with either antibodies.
RESULTS: Five adult patients with B-ALL were included. Three had active disease, 
and two were in morphological complete remission (CR) with minimal residual
disease (MRD+). Therapy before CAR-T included blinatumomab (3/5 [60 %]) and IO
(3/5 [60 %]), with one patient receiving both. One patient experienced severe
cytokine release syndrome and central nervous system toxicity and subsequently
died. At 28 days following treatment, two patients achieved CR with MRD
negativity, and two had an MRD + CR. Two patients received allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At a median of 10 months (range, 5-26,
three out of the four patients are still in CR, and one relapsed. The literature 
review identified a deficiency on data on the influence of blinatumumab and IO on
outcomes post CAR-T therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: CD19 CAR T-cell therapy after treatment with blinatumomab and/or IO 
in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL is feasible and results in promising
response rates in this case series. Future trails should specifically address
outcomes in this population.
