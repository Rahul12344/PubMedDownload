CD28 and CTLA-4 are homologous cell surface proteins expressed by T cells. CD28
is constitutively expressed by most T cells, whereas CTLA-4 is expressed by
activated T cells. Both proteins are ligands for the costimulatory molecules CD80
and CD86 expressed by activated B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. A
fusion protein comprising the CTLA-4 extracellular domain joined to a human
immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (CTLA4Ig) binds CD80 and CD-86 with
high affinity and inhibits CD80/CD86-dependent immune responses in vitro and in
vivo. Attempts at producing the CTLA-4 extracellular domain as an unfused protein
have met with limited success. Here we describe the expression and purification
of the CTLA-4 extracellular domain as a nonfused protein in Escherichia coli. The
12.5-kDa CTLA-4 extracellular domain was insoluble when expressed in E. coli and 
required denaturation, reduction, and refolding steps to become soluble and
assume its proper conformation. The protein refolded into a mixture of monomers, 
disulfide-linked dimers, and higher order disulfide-linked aggregates. sCTLA-4
dimers were the predominant refold form when air was used as the oxidizing agent 
during the refold procedure. Purified sCTLA-4 dimers were 10- to 50-fold more
potent than sCTLA-4 monomers at inhibiting T cell activation using a
CD80-dependent in vitro bioassay.
