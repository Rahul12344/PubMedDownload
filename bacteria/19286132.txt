Virulence effectors delivered into intestinal epithelial cells by Salmonella
trigger actin remodeling to direct pathogen internalization and intracellular
replication in Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs). One such effector, SptP,
functions early during pathogen entry to deactivate Rho GTPases and reverse
pathogen-induced cytoskeletal changes following uptake. SptP also harbors a
C-terminal protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) domain with no clear host
substrates. Investigating SptP's longevity in infected cells, we uncover a late
function of SptP, showing that it associates with SCVs, and its PTPase activity
increases pathogen replication. Direct SptP binding and specific
dephosphorylation of the AAA+ ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), a
facilitator of cellular membrane fusion and protein degradation, enhanced
pathogen replication in SCVs. VCP and its adaptors p47 and Ufd1 were necessary
for generating Salmonella-induced filaments on SCVs, a membrane fusion event
characteristic of the pathogen replicative phase. Thus, Salmonella regulates the 
biogenesis of an intracellular niche through SptP-mediated dephosphorylation of
VCP.
