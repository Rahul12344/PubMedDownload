Evidence suggests that environmental exposures and socioeconomic factors may
interact to produce metabolic changes in children. We assessed the influence of
residential location and socioeconomic status (SES) on pediatric body mass index 
(BMI) Z-score and fasting blood glucose (FBG) concentration. Participants
included 214 children aged 6-11 years who live near a large industrial complex in
Taranto, Italy. Participants were grouped into residential zones based on the
distance between their home address and the complex periphery (Zone 1:
0.000-4.999 km, Zone 2: 5.000-9.999 km, Zone 3: 10.000-15.000 km). BMI Z-scores
were calculated via World Health Organization (WHO) pediatric reference curves.
FBG was obtained via venous blood sampling. Closer residential location to the
industrial complex on the order of 5.000 km was significantly associated with
worsened metabolic outcomes, particularly in female children. Zone 1 participants
had higher BMI-adjusted FBG than Zone 2 and 3 participants (p < 0.05 versus Zone 
2; p < 0.01 versus Zone 3). SES did not significantly influence BMI-adjusted FBG.
Moreover, BMI Z-scores indicated high rates of overweight (22.0%) and obesity
(22.9%) in the cohort. BMI Z-score was not significantly associated with SES or
residential zone but was negatively associated with maternal education level (p <
0.05). These results offer new evidence that residing near industrial activity
may predict adverse effects on child metabolic health.
