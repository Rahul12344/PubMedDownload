The antifungal activities of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE)-based cationic
conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) and oligo-phenylene ethynylenes (OPEs) were
investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) as a model pathogen. 
The effect of the CPE and OPE materials on the vegetative cells and ascospores
were tested in the dark or with UV-irradiation. A number of the tested polymers
and oligomers significantly reduced the viability of the vegetative yeast cells
in the dark, with activities exceeding the commonly used antibiotic Amphotericin 
B. With UV-irradiation, all of the tested CPEs and OPEs exhibited potent
antifungal activities and completely inactivated the yeast cells. In particular, 
the oligomeric EO-OPE-1(Th, C2) strongly inactivates ascospores with UV-light at 
a dose level lower than sporicidal agents reported in the literature. Under
conditions that promote spore germination, the CPEs and OPEs show efficient
activities against the germinated spores. The protein-enriched outer envelope of 
yeast cells and germinated ascospores appears to serve as a main target for the
CPE and OPE antimicrobial materials.
