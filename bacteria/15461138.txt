Human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) is a cysteine-rich cationic low molecular weight
antimicrobial peptide, which exhibits a broad range of antimicrobial activity
without observed acquired resistance. In this work, multiple copies of the hBD-2 
gene were linked in tandem and the expression of the multiple joined genes in two
fusion expression system, pET28a(+) and pGEX-4T-2, was examined. Using plasmid
pET28a(+) with one, two, and four copies of the hBD-2 gene, the expressed level
was relatively low, whereas much higher with plasmid pGEX-4T-2, and the fusion
products, most of which in insoluble form, account for approximately 26% of the
total insoluble cellular proteins.
