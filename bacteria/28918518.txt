Gene regulatory networks in AML may be influenced by microRNAs (miRs) contained
in exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). We
sequenced miRs from exosomes isolated from marrow-derived MSCs from patients with
AML (n = 3) and from healthy controls (n = 3; not age-matched). Known targets of 
mIRs that were significantly different in AML-derived MSC exosomes compared to
controls were identified. Of the five candidate miRs identified by differential
packaging in exosomes, only miR-26a-5p and miR-101-3p were significantly
increased in AML-derived samples while miR-23b-5p, miR-339-3p and miR-425-5p were
significantly decreased. Validation of the predicted change in gene expression of
the potential targets was investigated by interrogating gene expression levels
from public datasets of marrow-derived CD34-selected cells from patients with AML
(n = 69) and healthy donors (n = 40). Two molecules with decreased gene
expression in AML (EZH2 and GSK3β) were predicted by the miR profiling and have
been previously implicated in AML while three molecules were increased in
AML-derived cells and have not been previously associated with leukemogenesis
(KRBA2, RRBP1 and HIST2H 2BE). In summary, profiling miRs in exosomes from
AML-derived MSCs allowed us to identify candidate miRs with potential relevance
in AML that could yield new insights regarding leukemogenesis or new treatment
strategies.
