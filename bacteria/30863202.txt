Periodontitis, an inflammatory disease caused by subgingival Gram-negative (G-)
bacteria, is linked with loss of the connective tissue and destruction of the
alveolar bone. In the regulation of inflammatory response, chemokine receptor 2
(CXCR2), a specific receptor for interleukin-8 and neutrophil chemoattractant,
plays an important role. The first aim of this study was to investigate the CXCR2
gene variability in chronic periodontitis (CP) patients and healthy
nonperiodontitis controls in the Czech population. The second aim was to find a
relation between CXCR2 gene variants and the presence of periodontal bacteria. A 
total of 500 unrelated subjects participated in this case-control study. 329 CP
patients and 171 healthy nonperiodontitis controls were analyzed using polymerase
chain reaction techniques for three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):
+785C/T (rs2230054), +1208T/C (rs1126579), and +1440A/G (rs1126580). A DNA
microarray detection kit was used for the investigation of the subgingival
bacterial colonization, in a subgroup of CP subjects (N = 162). No significant
differences in allele, genotype, haplotype, or haplogenotype frequencies of CXCR2
gene variants between patients with CP and healthy controls (P > 0.05) were
determined. Nevertheless, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was detected more
frequently in men positive for the C allele of the CXCR2 +785C/T polymorphism
(61.8% vs. 41.1%, P < 0.05; OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 1.03-5.20) and for the T allele
of the CXCR2 +1208C/T variant (61.8% vs. 38.9%, P < 0.05; OR = 2.54, 95% CI =
1.13-5.71). In contrast, no statistically significant associations of CXCR2
variants with seven selected periodontal bacteria were found in women. Although
none of the investigated SNPs in the CXCR2 gene was associated with CP, the CXCR2
gene variants can be associated with subgingival colonization of G- bacteria in
men with CP in the Czech population.
