Rationale: Myocardial injury, as reflected by elevated cardiac troponin levels in
plasma, is common in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but its
temporal dynamics and etiology remain unknown. Objectives: Our aim was to
determine the incidence of troponin release in patients with CAP and identify
risk factors that may point to underlying etiologic mechanisms. Methods: We
included consecutive patients admitted with severe CAP to two intensive care
units in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2015. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin
I was measured daily during the first week. We used multivariable linear
regression to identify variables associated with troponin release on admission,
and we used mixed-effects regression to model the daily rise and fall of troponin
levels over time. Results: Of 200 eligible patients, 179 were included, yielding 
792 observation days. A total of 152 (85%) patients developed raised troponin
levels greater than 26 ng/L. Baseline factors independently associated with
troponin release included coronary artery disease (176% increase; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 11-589), smoking (248% increase; 95% CI, 33-809), and higher Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV score (2% increase; 95% CI, 0.8-3.3),
whereas Staphylococcus aureus as a causative pathogen was protective (70%
reduction; 95% CI, 18-89). Time-dependent risk factors independently associated
with daily increase in troponin concentrations included reduced platelet count
(2.3% increase; 95% CI, 0.6-4), tachycardia (1.5% increase; 95% CI, 0.1-2.9),
hypotension (6.2% increase; 95% CI, 2.1-10.6), dobutamine use (44% increase; 95% 
CI, 12-85), prothrombin time (8.2% increase; 95% CI, 0.2-16.9), white cell count 
(1.7% increase; 95% CI, 0-3.5), and fever (22.7% increase; 95% CI, 0.1-49.6).
Conclusions: Cardiac injury develops in a majority of patients with severe CAP.
Myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch and activated inflammation/coagulation
are associated with this injury. Clinical trial registered with
www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01905033).
