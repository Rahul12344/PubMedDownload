Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) bacterial strains expressing active reductive
dehalogenase (RDase) enzymes play key roles in the transformation and
detoxification of chlorinated pollutants, including chlorinated ethenes. Site
monitoring regimes traditionally rely on qPCR to assess the presence of Dhc
biomarker genes; however, this technique alone cannot directly inform about
dechlorination activity. To supplement gene-centric approaches and provide a more
reliable proxy for dechlorination activity, we sought to demonstrate a targeted
proteomics approach that can characterize Dhc mediated dechlorination in
groundwater contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. Targeted peptide selection was
conducted in axenic cultures of Dhc strains 195, FL2, and BAV1. These experiments
yielded 37 peptides from housekeeping and structural proteins (i.e., GroEL,
EF-TU, rpL7/L2 and the S-layer), as well as proteins involved in the reductive
dechlorination activity (i.e., FdhA, TceA, and BvcA). The application of targeted
proteomics to a defined bacterial consortium and contaminated groundwater samples
resulted in the detection of FdhA peptides, which revealed active dechlorination 
with Dhc strain-level resolution, and the detection of RDases peptides indicating
specific reductive dechlorination steps. The results presented here show that
targeted proteomics can be applied to groundwater samples and provide protein
level information about Dhc dechlorination activity.
