Effects of oxygen and sulphydryl-containing compounds on irradiated transforming 
DNA. Part I. Actions of dithiothreitol.

Held KD, Harrop HA, Michael BD.

The actions and interactions of oxygen and the sulphydryl-containing compound
dithiothreitol (DTT) upon the radiation sensitivity of the biological activity of
purified Bacillus subtilis transforming DNA have been examined. It has previously
been shown that the sensitivity of transforming DNA irradiated in dilute solution
is less when irradiation is performed in 100 per cent O2 than when in 100 per
cent N2, i.e. O2 protects transforming DNA with a dose-modifying factor of about 
0.7. DTT protects transforming DNA in a manner that is dependent on DTT
concentration and on gassing conditions. In O2 the DTT protection can largely be 
attributed to the scavenging of .OH radicals by the DTT, but in anoxia DTT exerts
a further protective effect which results in an increasing oxygen enhancement
ratio (o.e.r.) with increasing DDT concentration to a maximum o.e.r. of about 14 
at 2-5 mM DTT. This additional protective effect of DTT is attributable to
hydrogen atom donation from DTT to DNA radicals, thus chemically repairing the
DNA. Oxygen appears to block this chemical repair reaction.
