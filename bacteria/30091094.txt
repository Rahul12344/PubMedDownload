Cyanobacterial biosynthesis of alkanes is an attractive way of producing
substitutes for petroleum-based fuels. Key enzymes for bioalkane production in
cyanobacteria are acyl-ACP reductase (AAR) and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase
(ADO). AAR catalyzes the reduction of the fatty acyl-ACP/CoA substrates to fatty 
aldehydes, which are then converted into alkanes/alkenes by ADO. These enzymes
have been widely used for biofuel production by metabolic engineering of
cyanobacteria and other organisms. However, both proteins, particularly ADO, have
low enzymatic activities, and their catalytic activities are desired to be
improved for use in biofuel production. Recently, progress has been made in the
basic sciences and in the application of AAR and ADO in alkane production. This
chapter provides an overview of recent advances in the study of the structure and
function of AAR and ADO, protein engineering of these enzymes for improving
activity and modifying substrate specificities, and examples of metabolic
engineering of cyanobacteria and other organisms using AAR and ADO for biofuel
production.
