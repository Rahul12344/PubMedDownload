Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles have been implicated as risk factors for
immune-mediated adverse drug reactions. The authors recently reported a strong
association between HLA-A*32:01 and vancomycin-induced drug reaction with
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. Identification of individuals with the risk
allele before or shortly after the initiation of vancomycin therapy is of great
clinical importance to prevent morbidity and mortality, and improve drug safety
and antibiotic treatment options. A prerequisite to the success of
pharmacogenetic screening tests is the development of simple, robust,
cost-effective single HLA allele test that can be implemented in routine
diagnostic laboratories. In this study, the authors developed a simple, real-time
allele-specific PCR for typing the HLA-A*32:01 allele. Four-hundred and
fifty-eight DNA samples including 30 HLA-A*32:01-positive samples were typed by
allele-specific PCR. Compared with American Society for Histocompatibility and
Immunogenetics-accredited, sequence-based, high-resolution, full-allelic HLA
typing, this assay demonstrates 100% accuracy, 100% sensitivity (95% CI, 88.43%
to 100%), and 100% specificity (95% CI, 99.14% to 100%). The lowest limit of
detection of this assay using PowerUp SYBR Green is 10 ng of template DNA. The
assay demonstrates a sensitivity and specificity to differentiate the HLA-A*32:01
allele from closely related non-HLA-A*32 alleles and may be used in clinical
settings to identify individuals with the risk allele before or during the course
of vancomycin therapy.
