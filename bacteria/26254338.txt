A CD1d-binding glycolipid, α-Galactosylceramide (αGalCer), activates invariant NK
T cells and acts as an adjuvant. We previously identified a fluorinated phenyl
ring-modified αGalCer analog, 7DW8-5, displaying nearly 100-fold stronger CD1d
binding affinity. In the current study, 7DW8-5 was found to exert a more potent
adjuvant effect than αGalCer for a vaccine based on radiation-attenuated
sporozoites of a rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, also referred to as 
irradiated P. yoelii sporozoites (IrPySpz). 7DW8-5 had a superb adjuvant effect
only when the glycolipid and IrPySpz were conjointly administered i.m. Therefore,
we evaluated the effect of distinctly different biodistribution patterns of
αGalCer and 7DW8-5 on their respective adjuvant activities. Although both
glycolipids induce a similar cytokine response in sera of mice injected i.v.,
after i.m. injection, αGalCer induces a systemic cytokine response, whereas
7DW8-5 is locally trapped by CD1d expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) in draining 
lymph nodes (dLNs). Moreover, the i.m. coadministration of 7DW8-5 with IrPySpz
results in the recruitment of DCs to dLNs and the activation and maturation of
DCs. These events cause the potent adjuvant effect of 7DW8-5, resulting in the
enhancement of the CD8(+) T cell response induced by IrPySpz and, ultimately,
improved protection against malaria. Our study is the first to show that the
colocalization of a CD1d-binding invariant NK T cell-stimulatory glycolipid and a
vaccine, like radiation-attenuated sporozoites, in dLN-resident DCs upon i.m.
conjoint administration governs the potency of the adjuvant effect of the
glycolipid.
