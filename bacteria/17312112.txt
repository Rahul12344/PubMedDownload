NKT cells are thought of as a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. In
this study, we demonstrate that mouse NKT cells are activated in response to
Escherichia coli LPS, and produce IFN-gamma, but not IL-4, although activation
through their TCR typically induces both IL-4 and IFN-gamma production. IFN-gamma
production by NKT cells is dependent on LPS-induced IL-12 and IL-18 from APC. LPS
induced IFN-gamma production by NKT cells does not require CD1d-mediated
presentation of an endogenous Ag and exposure to a combination of IL-12 and IL-18
is sufficient to activate them. In mice that are deficient for NKT cells, innate 
immune cells are activated less efficiently in response to LPS, resulting in the 
reduced production of TNF and IFN-gamma. We propose that in addition to acting as
a bridge to adaptive immunity, NKT cells act as an early amplification step in
the innate immune response and that the rapid and complete initiation of this
innate response depends on the early production of IFN-gamma by NKT cells.
