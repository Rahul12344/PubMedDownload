A novel multiplex real-time PCR for bloodstream infections (BSI-PCR) detects
pathogens directly in blood. This study aimed at determining the positive
predictive value (PPV) of BSI-PCR in critically ill patients with sepsis. We
included consecutive patients with presumed sepsis upon admission to the
intensive care unit (ICU). The multiplexed BSI-PCR included 17 individual PCRs
for a broad panel of species- and genus-specific DNA targets. BSI-PCR results
were compared with a reference diagnosis for which plausibility of infection and 
causative pathogen(s) had been prospectively assessed by trained observers, based
on available clinical and microbiological evidence. PPV and false positive
proportion (FPP) were calculated. Clinical plausibility of discordant positive
results was adjudicated by an expert panel. Among 325 patients, infection
likelihood was categorized as confirmed, uncertain, and ruled out in 210 (65%),
88 (27%), and 27 (8%) subjects, respectively. BSI-PCR identified one or more
microorganisms in 169 (52%) patients, of whom 104 (61%) had at least one
detection in accordance with the reference diagnosis. Discordant positive PCR
results were observed in 95 patients, including 30 subjects categorized as having
an "unknown" pathogen. Based on 5525 individual PCRs yielding 295 positive
results, PPV was 167/295 (57%) and FPP was 128/5525 (2%). Expert adjudication of 
the 128 discordant PCR findings resulted in an adjusted PPV of 68% and FPP of 2%.
BSI-PCR was all-negative in 156 patients, including 79 (51%) patients in whom
infection was considered ruled out. BSI-PCR may complement conventional cultures 
and expedite the microbiological diagnosis of sepsis in ICU patients, but
improvements in positive predictive value of the test are warranted before its
implementation in clinical practice can be considered.
