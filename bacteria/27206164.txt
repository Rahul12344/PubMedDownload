The bacterial flagellum enables directed movement of Salmonella enterica towards 
favorable conditions in liquid environments. Regulation of flagellar synthesis is
tightly controlled by various environmental signals at transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels. The flagellar master regulator FlhD4 C2 resides on
top of the flagellar transcriptional hierarchy and is under autogenous control by
FlhD4 C2 -dependent activation of the repressor rflM. The inhibitory activity of 
RflM depends on the presence of RcsB, the response regulator of the RcsCDB
phosphorelay system. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of
RflM-dependent repression of flhDC. We show that RcsB and RflM form a heterodimer
that coordinately represses flhDC transcription independent of RcsB
phosphorylation. RcsB-RflM complex binds to a RcsB box downstream the P1
transcriptional start site of the flhDC promoter with increased affinity compared
to RcsB in the absence of RflM. We propose that RflM stabilizes binding of
unphosphorylated RcsB to the flhDC promoter in absence of environmental cues.
Thus, RflM is a novel auxiliary regulatory protein that mediates target
specificity of RcsB for flhDC repression. The cooperative action of the RcsB-RflM
repressor complex allows Salmonella to fine-tune initiation of flagellar gene
expression and adds another level to the complex regulation of flagellar
synthesis.
