In this report, we demonstrate that exonucleolytic turnover is much more
important in the regulation of sRNA levels than was previously recognized. For
the first time, PNPase is introduced as a major regulatory feature controlling
the levels of the small noncoding RNAs MicA and RybB, which are required for the 
accurate expression of outer membrane proteins (OMPs). In the absence of PNPase, 
the pattern of OMPs is changed. In stationary phase, MicA RNA levels are
increased in the PNPase mutant, leading to a decrease in the levels of its target
ompA mRNA and the respective protein. This growth phase regulation represents a
novel pathway of control. We have evaluated other ribonucleases in the control of
MicA RNA, and we showed that degradation by PNPase surpasses the effect of
endonucleolytic cleavages by RNase E. RybB was also destabilized by PNPase. This 
work highlights a new role for PNPase in the degradation of small noncoding RNAs 
and opens the way to evaluate striking similarities between bacteria and
eukaryotes.
