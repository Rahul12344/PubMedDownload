In this work, models of the homotetrameric C2 component of the monooxygenase
p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase from Acinetobacter baumannii, in complex with 
dioxygen (O2 ) and, or not, the substrate p-hydroxyphenylacetate (HPA) were
built. Both models proved to be amenable to random-acceleration molecular
dynamics (RAMD) simulations, whereby a tiny randomly oriented external force,
acting on O2 at the active site in front of flavin mononucleotide (FMNH(-) ),
accelerated displacement of O2 toward the bulk solvent. This allowed us to carry 
out a sufficiently large number of RAMD simulations to be of statistical
significance. The two systems behaved very similarly under RAMD, except for O2
leaving the active site more easily in the absence of HPA, but then finding
similar obstacles in getting to the gate as when the active site was sheltered by
HPA. This challenges previous conclusions that HPA can only reach the active
center after that the C4aOOH derivative of FMNH(-) is formed, requiring uptake of
O2 at the active site before HPA. According to these RAMD simulations, O2 could
well get to FMNH(-) also in the presence of the substrate at the active site.
