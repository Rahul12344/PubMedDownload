The exponentially increasing volumes of DNA sequence data highlight the need for 
new DNA cloning methods to explore the new information. Here, we describe
'ExoCET' (Exonuclease Combined with RecET recombination) to directly clone any
chosen region from bacterial and mammalian genomes with nucleotide precision into
operational plasmids. ExoCET combines in vitro exonuclease and annealing with the
remarkable capacity of full length RecET homologous recombination (HR) to
retrieve specified regions from genomic DNA preparations. Using T4 polymerase
(T4pol) as the in vitro exonuclease for ExoCET, we directly cloned large regions 
(>50 kb) from bacterial and mammalian genomes, including DNA isolated from blood.
Employing RecET HR or Cas9 cleavage in vitro, the directly cloned region can be
chosen with nucleotide precision to position, for example, a gene into an
expression vector without the need for further subcloning. In addition to its
utility for bioprospecting in bacterial genomes, ExoCET presents straightforward 
access to mammalian genomes for various applications such as region-specific DNA 
sequencing that retains haplotype phasing, the rapid construction of optimal,
haplotypic, isogenic targeting constructs or a new way to genotype that presents 
advantages over Southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction. The direct
cloning capacities of ExoCET present new freedoms in recombinant DNA technology.
