An increased traffic of circulating CD34+ Hemopoietic Precursors Cells (HPC) is
an important feature of systemic allergic inflammation. Bacteria and bacterial
products are capable of stimulating the transcription of the maturational
cytokines IL12 and IFNs through the activation of Toll-Like-Receptor and the
subsequent nuclear translocation of the NF-kappaB factor. In this study the
probiotics differentiation/maturational effect potential on CD34+ HPC has been
investigated. Fourteen consecutive subjects, 9M and 5F, aged 6-48, with clinical 
symptoms of asthma and /or conjunctivitis, rhinitis, urticaria, atopic
dermatitis, food allergy and irritable bowel syndrome were enrolled.
Allergen-specific serum IgE were found in twelve patients. Flow-cytometric
measurement of peripheral blood CD34dim/bright HPC values were assessed before
and after 30 days of therapy, consisting in the oral administration of one sachet
a day of ENDOLAC (UCB Pharma, Turin, Italy). Each sachet contained a mixture of
Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. delbrueckii and Streptococcus thermophilus for a
total of 1 x 10(9) live bacteria. Circulating CD34+ cell values significantly (p 
< 0.001) reduced after the treatment. ENDOLAC, thus, may improve the efficacy of 
the standard treatments of allergic diseases.
