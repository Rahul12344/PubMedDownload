nonpermissive) human monocytic U937 cells differ in their production of
cytokines.

The cytokine secretion of the Salmonella-permissive, HLA-B27-positive U937 cells 
was examined, as it was previously shown that these cells kill Salmonella less
efficiently than controls. Salmonella-permissive U937 cells showed upregulated
production of interleukin 10 and to a lesser extent tumor necrosis factor alpha. 
HLA-B27-associated modulation of cytokine responses may have importance in the
pathogenesis of reactive arthritis.
