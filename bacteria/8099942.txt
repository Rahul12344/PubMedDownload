Various populations of accessory cells differ in their abilities to function as
effective antigen-presenting cells (APC) and stimulate CD4+ T cells to produce
interleukin-2. Three important factors directly related to APC potency are the
expression of class II major histocompatibility complex molecules and the ability
to present peptide antigens to the T cell antigen receptor, the expression of
costimulatory ligands which deliver important activation signals independent of T
cell receptor occupancy and the expression of adhesion molecules which promote
conjugate formation so that these activation signals can be effectively delivered
to the T cells. The relative importance of these accessory cell functions in T
cell activation will be discussed, with an emphasis on costimulation and the
CD28/B7 receptor/ligand pair. The consequence of inadequate costimulation by an
otherwise effective APC in inducing T cell anergy will also be discussed.
