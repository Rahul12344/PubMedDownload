Follicular regulatory T (TFR) cells are a newly defined regulatory T cell (Treg) 
subset that suppresses follicular helper T cell-mediated B cell responses in the 
germinal center reaction. The precise costimulatory signal requirements for
proper TFR cell differentiation and function are still not known. Using
conditional knockout strategies of CD28, we previously demonstrated that loss of 
CD28 signaling in Tregs caused autoimmunity in mice (termed CD28-ΔTreg mice),
characterized by lymphadenopathy, accumulation of activated T cells, and
cell-mediated inflammation of the skin and lung. In this study, we show that CD28
signaling is required for TFR cell differentiation. Treg-specific deletion of
CD28 caused a reduction in TFR cell numbers and function, which resulted in
increased germinal center B cells and Ab production. Moreover, residual
CD28-deficient TFR cells showed a diminished suppressive capacity as assessed by 
their ability to inhibit Ab responses in vitro. Surprisingly, genetic deletion of
B cells in CD28-ΔTreg mice prevented the development of lymphadenopathy and CD4+ 
T cell activation, and autoimmunity that mainly targeted skin and lung tissues.
Thus, autoimmunity occurring in mice with CD28-deficient Tregs appears to be
driven primarily by loss of TFR cell differentiation and function with resulting 
B cell-driven inflammation.
