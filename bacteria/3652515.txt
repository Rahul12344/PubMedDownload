A 3-year-old girl developed a disseminated Mycobacterium avium infection despite 
treatment with eight antimycobacterial drugs. She had no pre-existent general
humoral or cellular immunodeficiency. In the course of the disease B lymphocyte
areas in the lymphoid tissues were replaced by histiocytes and an IgM and IgA
deficiency evolved. The patient still made antibodies to concomitant
micro-organisms and to transfused blood cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) had normal responses to mitogens and various antigens in vitro. However,
she lacked any response to mycobacterial antigens, in vivo and in vitro. The
defect appeared not to be dependent on immunosuppression by lymphocytes or
monocytes or on deficient antigen presentation by monocytes. because a genetic
origin could not be substantiated, acquired immunological paralysis for
mycobacterial antigens was the most likely explanation. Addition of irradiated
PBMC from her HLA-A, -B, -C and -DR phenotypically identical father, transferred 
a response to mycobacterial antigens of the patient's PBMC in vitro. We concluded
that the disseminated M. avium infection was accompanied by a selective
deficiency of the lymphocyte response to mycobacterial antigens which could be
restored by allogeneic antigen responsive lymphocytes.
