The serotonin transporter (SLC6A4), 5-HT2A (HTR2A) and 5-HT2B (HTR2B) recepter
genes, express proteins that are important regulators of serotonin reuptake and
signaling, and thereby may contribute to the pathogenesis of aggressive criminal 
behavior. 370 sentenced murderers in Pakistani prisons and 359 men without any
history of violence or criminal delinquency were genotyped for six candidate
polymorphisms in SLC6A4, HTR2A and HTR2B genes. An association of higher
expressing L/L and LA/LA variants of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was observed with 
homicidal behavior (bi-allelic: OR = 1.29, p = 0.016, tri-allelic: OR = 1.32,
p = 0.015) and in the murderer group only with response to verbal abuse
(OR = 2.11, p = 0.015), but not with other measures of self-reported aggression. 
L/L and LA/LA genotypes of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were associated with higher 
aggression scores on STAX1 scale of aggression compared to lower expressing
genotypes (S/S, S/LG, LG/LG) in prison inmates. No associations were apparent for
other serotonergic gene polymorphisms analyzed. Using the Braineac and GTEx
databases, we demonstrated significant eQTL based functional effects for rs25531 
in HTTLPR and other serotonergic polymorphisms analyzed in different brain
regions and peripheral tissues. In conclusion, these findings implicate SLC6A4*
HTTLPR as a major genetic determinant associated with criminal aggression. Future
studies are needed to replicate this finding and establish the biologic
intermediate phenotypes mediating this relationship.
