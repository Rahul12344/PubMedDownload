AIM: To examine human beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3) expression in inflamed gastric
mucosal tissues or MKN45 gastric cancer cells with or without H. pylori infection
for better understanding the innate immune response to H. pylori.
METHODS: We used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions and
immunohistochemistry to examine hBD-3 expression in inflamed gastric mucosal
tissues or MKN45 gastric cancer cells with or without H. pylori. Effects of hBD-3
against H. pylori were also evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean mRNA expression of hBD-3 in H. pylori-positive specimens was
significantly higher than that in H pylori-negative specimens (P = 0.0002,
Mann-Whitney). In addition, unlike uninfected samples, 8 of 15 (53.33%) infected 
mucosal samples expressed hBD-3 protein. H. pylori dose-dependently induced mRNA 
expression of hBD-3 in MKN45 cells, an effect inhibited by adding anti-toll-like 
receptor (TLR)-4 antibody. HBD-3 protein completely inhibited H. pylori growth.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that like hBD-2, hBD-3 may be involved in the
pathophysiology of H. pylori-induced gastritis.
