Clinical bacteriological evaluation of infantile bacteriuria treated with
fosfomycin.

Ureta A, Magari√±os JI, Sousa AS.

The therapeutic action of fosfomycin has been studied in a group of 14 children, 
with simple and complicated infections of the urinary tract with congenital renal
malformations. In the bacteriological study of the urine it was observed that the
strains most frequently isolated were E. coli, Proteus sp. and Klebsiella sp. Of 
the 25 strains isolated 76% were sensitive to the disc of 50 mug fosfomycin and
24% moderately sensitive with a MIC of 64 and 128 mug/ml. The doses of fosfomycin
used were 150 mg/kg/day in four administrations. In 13 cases it was administered 
orally alone and in one case orally and intramuscularly. The results have been
good in 10 cases (71.4%) and bad in four cases. The antibiotic has shown good
tolerance and no secondary effects have been noticed.
