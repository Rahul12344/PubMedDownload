Adhesion by means of beta1-integrins induces the phosphorylation of Akt, an event
strictly dependent on the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K).
Binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to phosphorylated tyrosine 397 in
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is considered to be the mechanism of cell
adhesion-induced activation of class Ia PI3K. Here we show that PI3K-dependent
phosphorylation of Akt in response to ligation of beta1-integrins occurs
efficiently in the absence of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. Akt S473
phosphorylation was strongly promoted both in cells expressing the integrin
subunit splice variant beta1B, which is unable to activate FAK, and in FAK
knockout cells. In addition, we found this phosphorylation to be independent of
the Src family kinases Src, Fyn and Yes. These results indicate that a major
pathway for adhesion-dependent activation of PI3K/Akt is triggered by the
membrane proximal part of the beta1 subunit in a FAK and Src-independent manner.
