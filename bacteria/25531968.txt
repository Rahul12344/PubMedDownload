AIMS: In order to identify new scaffolds for drug discovery, surface plasmon
resonance is frequently used to screen structurally diverse libraries. Usually,
hit rates are low and identification processes are time consuming. Hence,
approaches which improve hit rates and, thus, reduce the library size are
required.
METHODS: In this work, we studied three often used strategies for their
applicability to identify inhibitors of PqsD. In two of them, target-specific
aspects like inhibition of a homologous protein or predicted binding determined
by virtual screening were used for compound preselection. Finally, a fragment
library, covering a large chemical space, was screened and served as comparison.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: Indeed, higher hit rates were observed for methods
employing preselected libraries indicating that target-oriented compound
selection provides a time-effective alternative.
