DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) can be repaired by two major pathways:
non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). DNA repair
pathway choice is governed by the opposing activities of 53BP1, in complex with
its effectors RIF1 and REV7, and BRCA1. However, it remains unknown how the
53BP1/RIF1/REV7 complex stimulates NHEJ and restricts HR to the S/G2 phases of
the cell cycle. Using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach, we identify 11
high-confidence REV7 interactors and elucidate the role of SHLD2 (previously
annotated as FAM35A and RINN2) as an effector of REV7 in the NHEJ pathway. FAM35A
depletion impairs NHEJ-mediated DNA repair and compromises antibody
diversification by class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells. FAM35A
accumulates at DSBs in a 53BP1-, RIF1-, and REV7-dependent manner and antagonizes
HR by limiting DNA end resection. In fact, FAM35A is part of a larger complex
composed of REV7 and SHLD1 (previously annotated as C20orf196 and RINN3), which
promotes NHEJ and limits HR Together, these results establish SHLD2 as a novel
effector of REV7 in controlling the decision-making process during DSB repair.
