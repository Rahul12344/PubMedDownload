Although innate immune signals shape the activation of naive T cells, it is
unclear how innate signals influence effector T-cell function. This study
determined the effects of stimulating the NKG2D receptor in conjunction with the 
TCR on human effector CD8(+) T cells. Stimulation of CD8(+) T cells through CD3
and NKG2D simultaneously or through a chimeric NKG2D receptor, which consists of 
NKG2D fused to the intracellular region of CD3ζ, activated β-catenin and
increased expression of β-catenin-induced genes, whereas T cells stimulated
through the TCR or a combination of the TCR and CD28 did not. Activation by TCR
and NKG2D prevented expression and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
IL-10, IL-9, IL-13, and VEGF-α in a β-catenin- and PPARγ- dependent manner. NKG2D
stimulation also modulated the cytokine secretion of T cells activated
simultaneously through CD3 and CD28. These data indicate that activating CD8(+) T
cells through the NKG2D receptor along with the TCR modulates signal transduction
and the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, human effector T cells
alter their function depending on which innate receptors are engaged in
conjunction with the TCR complex.
