A new family of polyphenolic carbosilane dendrimers functionalized with ferulic, 
caffeic, and gallic acids has been obtained through a straightforward amidation
reaction. Their antioxidant activity has been studied by different techniques
such as DPPH (2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay, FRAP
assay (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and cyclic voltammetry. The
antioxidant analysis showed that polyphenolic dendrimers exhibited higher
activities than free polyphenols in all cases. The first-generation dendrimer
decorated with gallic acid stood out as the best antioxidant compound, displaying
a correlation between the number of hydroxyl groups in the polyphenol structure
and the antioxidant activity of the compounds. Moreover, the antibacterial
capacity of these new systems has been screened against Gram-positive (+) and
Gram-negative (-) bacteria, and we observed that polyphenolic dendrimers
functionalized with caffeic and gallic acids were capable of decreasing bacterial
growth. In contrast, ferulic carbosilane dendrimers and free polyphenols showed
no effect, establishing a correlation between antioxidant activity and
antibacterial capacity. Finally, a viability assay in human skin fibroblasts
cells (HFF-1) allowed for corroborating the nontoxicity of the polyphenolic
dendrimers at their active antibacterial concentration.
