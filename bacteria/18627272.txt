BACKGROUND: The efferent vagus nerve can inhibit inflammation via interaction
between acetylcholine and alpha7 cholinergic receptors.
METHODS: To determine the role played by alpha7 receptors in antibacterial
defense, peritonitis was induced in alpha7 receptor-deficient (alpha7(-/-)) and
wild-type (WT) mice by intraperitoneal injection with Escherichia coli.
RESULTS: At 20 h after infection, virtually all alpha7(-/-) mice had cleared the 
infection from their peritoneal cavities and had sterile blood cultures, whereas 
WT mice had high bacterial loads at the primary site of infection and were
bacteremic. In addition, bacterial burdens in liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs
were much lower in alpha7(-/-) mice, and these animals displayed a diminished
inflammatory response, as reflected by a reduced number of infiltrating
neutrophils in peritoneal lavage fluid and lower circulating cytokine levels. At 
2 h after infection, however, when bacterial loads were still similar in
alpha7(-/-) and WT mice, the former mouse strain showed a more robust influx of
neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity.
CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency of the alpha7 receptor is associated with an accelerated 
clearance of E. coli after intraperitoneal infection, preceded by a faster
recruitment of neutrophils. These data provide the first evidence for a
detrimental role of alpha7 receptors in the host defense against bacteria.
