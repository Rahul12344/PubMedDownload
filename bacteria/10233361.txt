We have analysed the potential of an endothelialized hydroxyapatite matrix (HAP),
a synthetic bone substitute, as a cellularized support for the expansion of
haemopoietic progenitor cells. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the
endothelial cells (EC) tended to form a monolayer fitting closely to the matrix, 
and that the progenitors adhered to the EC layer. Endothelialized HAP supported
the proliferation and differentiation of the progenitors with the addition of the
exogenous cytokines IL-1, and IL-3. The expanded cell population essentially
belonged to the myeloid and monocytic lineages, with a smaller percentage of the 
megakaryocyte lineage. In comparative experiments CD34+ progenitors were expanded
on endothelialized tissue culture flasks, and a significant higher viability of
the expanded cells was found with the endothelialized HAP. A high percentage
(approx. 40%) of mature granulocytes was generated in accordance with the
presence of differentiating cytokines such as G-CSF and GM-CSF at high
concentrations in the coculture medium. Other cytokines that could be detected
were IL-6, M-CSF, SCF, flt3-ligand. More than 50% of the expanded cell population
was able to phagocytose bacteria and to generate an oxydative burst. These data
indicate that cellularized HAP may be a useful matrix for stromal cell-based
expansion systems.
