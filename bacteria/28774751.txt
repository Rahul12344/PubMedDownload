Lipase (E.C.3.1.1.3) belongs to the hydrolases and is also known as fat
splitting, glycerol ester hydrolase or triacylglycerol acylhydrolase. Lipase
catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides converting them to glycerol and fatty
acids in an oil-water interface. These are widely used in food, dairy, flavor,
pharmaceuticals, biofuels, leather, cosmetics, detergent, and chemical
industries. Lipases are of plant, animal, and microbial origin, but microbial
lipases are produced at industrial level and represent the most widely used class
of enzymes in biotechnological applications and organic chemistry. Phylogenetic
analysis and comparison of residues around GxSxG motif provided an insight to the
diversity among bacterial lipases. A variety of para-Nitrophenyl (p-NP) esters
having C2 to C16 (p-NP acetate to p-NP palmitate) in their fatty acid side chain 
can be hydrolyzed by bacterial lipases. Large heterogeneity has been observed in 
molecular and catalytic characteristics of lipases including molecular mass;
19-96 kDa, Km; 0.0064-16.58 mM, Kcat; 0.1665-1.0 × 104 s-1 and Kcat/Km;
26.02-7377 s-1/mM. Optimal conditions of their working temperature and pH have
been stated 15-70 °C and 5.0-10.8, respectively and are strongly associated with 
the type and growth conditions of bacteria. Surface hydrophobicity, enzyme
activity, stability in organic solvents and at high temperature, proteolytic
resistance and substrate tolerance are the properties of bacterial lipases that
have been improved by engineering. Bacterial lipases have been extensively
studied during last decade. However, their wider applications demand a detailed
review on purification, catalytic characterization and applications of lipases.
