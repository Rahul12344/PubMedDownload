BACKGROUND/AIMS: Finding differences in systemic inflammatory response in
ulcerative colitis (UC), UC with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), and CDI
could lead to a better ability to differentiate between UC with symptomatic CDI
and UC with C. difficile colonization, and could identify specific inflammatory
pathways for UC or CDI, which could be therapeutic targets.
METHODS: We prospectively collected sera from symptomatic UC patients whose
stools were tested for toxigenic C. difficile, and from CDI patients who did not 
have UC (CDI-noUC). The UC patients with positive tests (UC-CDI) were further
categorized into responders to CDI treatment (UC-CDI-R) and non-responders
(UC-CDI-NR). We compared serum inflammatory mediators among groups using
unadjusted and adjusted multivariable statistics.
RESULTS: We included 117 UC [27 UC-CDI, 90 UC without CDI (UC-noCDI)] and 16
CDI-noUC patients. Principal component analysis (PCA) did not reveal significant 
differences either between UC-CDI and UC-noCDI groups, or between UC-CDI-R and
UC-CDI-NR groups. In contrast, the PCA showed significant separation between the 
UC and CDI-noUC groups (P = 0.002). In these two groups, hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) levels were significantly lower
and IL-23 levels were higher in UC patients in multivariable analyses. The model 
to distinguish UC from CDI including IL-23, HGF, CCL2, age, gender, and HGB had
an AuROC of 0.93.
CONCLUSION: Inflammatory profiles could not distinguish UC-CDI from UC-noCDI, and
UC-CDI-R from UC-CDI-NR. However, the UC and CDI-noUC groups were significantly
different. Future work should examine whether therapeutic agents inhibiting IL-23
or stimulating HGF can treat UC.
