Neisseria gonorrhoeae WS1 is a spontaneous pyocin (a bacteriocin produced by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa)-resistant mutant of N. gonorrhoeae FA19 that produces a
truncated lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and is non-transformable. The LOS-specific
mutation in WS1 was moved into a transformable background by transforming FA19
with chromosomal DNA from WS1 (generating strain JWS-1). A clone (pJCL2) capable 
of restoring JWS-1 to wild-type LOS expression, as detected by its acquisition of
reactivity with monoclonal antibodies and by its complemented sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile, was isolated. Sequential
unidirectional deletion and DNA sequence analysis of pJCL2 identified an open
reading frame, designated lsi-7, that could complement the defect in JWS-1.
Homology searches against various databases indicated that lsi-7 bad homology
with several Escherichia coli genes involved in the phosphorylation of sugars.
lsi-7 is adjacent to the lsi-6 gene, another gene involved in LOS biosynthesis.
Complementation studies using Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide mutants
showed lsi-6 and lsi-7 to be gonococcal homologs of S. typhimurium rfaD and rfaE,
respectively. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis demonstrated that lsi-6 and
lsi-7 are part of the same transcriptional unit.
