Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a widely used Gram-positive probiotic strain, is
clinically well known for its perceived health-promoting effects. It has recently
been shown to display proteinaceous pilus fibres (called SpaCBA) on its cell
surface. Structurally, SpaCBA pili possess a characteristic three-pilin
polymerized architecture, with repeating SpaA major pilins that form the backbone
and two types of minor subunits (SpaB and SpaC). In this study, recombinant SpaA 
protein was purified, characterized and crystallized. The crystals diffracted to 
a resolution of 2.0 Å and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters
a=227.9, b=63.2, c=104.3 Å, β=95.1°.
