OBJECTIVE: A hallmark of sepsis and severe systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) is the massive recruitment of immature neutrophils from the bone 
marrow into the circulation (left shift, band forms). Their capacity to
participate in innate defense against bacteria is ill defined. We aimed at
comparing various innate immune functions of mature vs. immature neutrophils
circulating during sepsis and SIRS.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary level ICU and associated research laboratory.
PATIENTS: : Thirty-three ICU patients with sepsis; 12 ICUs with SIRS; 32 healthy 
volunteers.
INTERVENTIONS: Twenty milliliters of whole heparinized blood was used for in
vitro studies including neutrophil viability and apoptosis, surface expression of
CD16, Toll-like receptors () 4 and TLR2, CD14, MD-2, HLA-DP,-DQ and -DR, and
CXCR2, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and tumor necrosis
factor-α/interleukin-10 baseline intracellular cytokine levels.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immature neutrophils were capable of mediating
important innate immune functions such as bacterial phagocytosis and killing via 
the production of reactive oxygen species, although less efficiently than mature 
neutrophils. Immature neutrophils had a longer life span and resistance to
spontaneous apoptosis, and could mature ex vivo. They expressed lower levels of
receptors for bacterial molecules such as CD14 and MD-2 and migrated less
efficiently than mature granulocytes. Immature neutrophils had higher basal
intracellular tumor necrosis factor-α/interleukin-10 ratio than that of mature
neutrophils, suggesting a proinflammatory phenotype. No significant differences
were observed between immature neutrophils isolated from patients with sepsis and
those from patients with severe SIRS.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their "immaturity", band forms are capable of mediating
crucial innate immune functions during severe infections and sepsis. Their fate
and capacity to mature in vivo remain to be determined.
