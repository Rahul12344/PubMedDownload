AIM: Interleukin-17F (IL-17F) is involved with asthma. The aim of this study was 
to evaluate the association of IL17F polymorphisms with childhood asthma after
bronchiolitis in infancy.
METHODS: We invited 166 children who were hospitalised for bronchiolitis at
younger than 6 months of age to follow-up visits at 5-7 years and 11-13 years of 
ages. Asthma and allergy diagnoses, asthma-presumptive symptoms and use of
inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) were registered. Blood samples were available for 
IL17F rs763780 (T/C), rs11465553 (C/T) and rs7741835 (C/T) determinations in 165 
cases.
RESULTS: The presence of IL17F rs11465553 and rs7741835 variations showed no
significant associations with any asthma or allergy outcome at either 5-7 years
or 11-13 years of ages. Instead, children with the variant IL17F rs763780
genotype had used more often ICSs between the follow-up visits from 5-7 to
11-13 years (adjusted OR 3.58) than those with the wild genotype. Children with
the variant IL17F rs763780 genotype reported more often doctor-diagnosed atopic
dermatitis (adjusted OR 2.71) at 11-13 years of age than those with the wild
genotype.
CONCLUSION: This prospective long-term follow-up study provided preliminary
evidence on the association of the IL17F rs763780 polymorphism with asthma at
school age after bronchiolitis in infancy.
