Omadacycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic. Phase III clinical trial
results have shown that omadacycline has an acceptable safety profile in the
treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and
community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. Similar to most tetracyclines, transient 
nausea and vomiting and low-magnitude increases in liver aminotransferases were
the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in phase III studies but were
not treatment limiting. Package insert warnings and precautions for omadacycline 
include tooth discoloration; enamel hypoplasia; inhibition of bone growth
following use in late pregnancy, infancy, or childhood up to 8 years of age; an
imbalance in mortality (2%, compared with 1% in moxifloxacin-treated patients)
was observed in the phase III study in patients with community-acquired bacterial
pneumonia. Omadacycline has no effect on the QT interval, and its affinity for
muscarinic M2 receptors resulted in transient heart rate increases following
dosing.
