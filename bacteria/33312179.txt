Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteremia is responsible for
over 10,000 deaths in the hospital setting each year. Both conventional CD4+ T
cells and γδ T cells play protective roles in SA infection through secretion of
IFN-γ and IL-17. However, the role of other unconventional T cells in SA
infection is largely unknown. Natural killer T (NKT) cells, a subset of
innate-like T cells, are activated rapidly in response to a wide range of self
and microbial lipid antigens presented by MHC I-like molecule CD1d. NKT cells are
divided into two groups, invariant NKT (iNKT) and type II NKT cells, based on TCR
usage. Using mice lacking either iNKT cells or both types of NKT cells, we show
that both NKT cell subsets are activated after systemic SA infection and produce 
IFN-γ in response to SA antigen, however type II NKT cells are sufficient to
control bacterial burden and inflammatory infiltrate in infected organs. This
protective capacity was specific for NKT cells, as mice lacking mucosal
associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, another innate-like T cell subset, had no
increased susceptibility to SA systemic infection. We identify polar lipid
species from SA that induce IFN-γ production from type II NKT cells, which
requires both CD1d-TCR engagement and IL-12 production by antigen presenting
cells. We also demonstrate that a population of T cells enriched for type II NKT 
cells are increased in PBMC of SA bacteremic patients compared to healthy
controls. Therefore, type II NKT cells perform effector functions that enhance
control of SA infection prior to conventional T cell activation and recognize
SA-derived lipid antigens. As CD1d is highly conserved in humans, these
CD1d-restricted SA lipid antigens could be used in the design of next generation 
SA vaccines targeting cell-mediated immunity.
