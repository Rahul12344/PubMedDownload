Comparison of a bacteria produced odour compound with a chemical reference
substance and a simple method for getting and concentrating biogenic odour
compounds (author's transl)].

An increase in using surface water and bank filtration processes as raw water for
drinking water production sometimes gave rise to problems of bad taste and odour.
Some of these odourous compounds may be produced by bacteria, especially
Streptomyces species. They are able to pass active carbon filters and therefore
are a problem as well in raw water as in treated water. Biogenic odourous
compounds often are soluble in water, that means they are present without being
fixed to the bacteria cell. Human nose is able to percieve even dilutions of
about 10(-9). If a bacterial produced substance is compared with an equal
smelling chemical substance such as Isoborneol, also diltuions of 10(-9) may be
smelt. Gas-chromatography only detects concentrations up to 10(-5), so the nose
is much more efficient.
