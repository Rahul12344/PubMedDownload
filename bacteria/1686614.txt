The fluorescent dye, Peridinin chlorophyll A protein (PerCP) derived from
dinoflagellate organisms (Glenodinium sp.) can be excited by a 488 nm laser and
emits light with a large Stokes shift and no major spectral overlap with commonly
used chromophores such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and R-phycoerythrin
(PE). PerCP was conjugated directly to various mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 
specific for human leukocyte markers or to avidin for use with biotinylated-mAb, 
and used to perform three color single-laser flow cytometry. The efficacy of this
method was demonstrated by analyzing the heterogeneity of thymus T lineage
subsets and B lymphocyte subsets in blood. CD4-CD8-, CD4+CD8+ and CD4+CD8- or
CD4-CD8+ subsets differ in their expression of cell-cell interaction markers
including CD18, CD28, CD44 and Leu 8, and activation/subset markers CD45RO,
CD45RA and CD26. Some CD5+ peripheral blood B cells, unlike CD5-B cells,
expressed CD45RO or high levels of CD54 (ICAM-1) suggesting the CD5+ B cell
population contains activated lymphocytes. The availability of such an accessible
method for three color analysis will make it possible to do routine three color
monitoring of immunologic diseases such as AIDS, and autoimmune or periodontal
diseases.
