PURPOSE: The Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an inherited genetic disorder
characterized by a typical facial appearance, microcephaly, growth retardation,
immunodeficiency, and a strong predisposition to malignancies, especially of
lymphoid origin. NBS patients have a mutation in the NBN gene which involves the 
repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here we studied the peripheral T cell 
compartment of NBS patients with a focus on immunological senescence.
METHODS: The absolute numbers and frequencies of the different T cell subsets
were determined in NBS patients from young age till adulthood and compared to
age-matched healthy individuals (HI). In addition, we determined the expression
of senescent T cell markers and the signal joint T cell receptor excision circles
(sjTRECs) content.
RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that NBS patients have reduced T cell numbers.
NBS patients showed lower numbers of αβ+ T cells, but normal γδ+ T cell numbers
compared to HI. Concerning the αβ+ T cells, both CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cells
were excessively reduced in numbers compared to aged-matched HI. In addition, NBS
patients showed higher frequencies of the more differentiated T cells expressing 
the senescent cell marker CD57 and did not express co-stimulatory molecule CD28. 
These effects were already present in the youngest age group. Furthermore, NBS
patients showed lower sjTREC content in their T cells possibly indicative of a
lower thymic output.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that circulating T cells from NBS patients show signs of
a senescent phenotype which is already present from young age on and which might 
explain their T cell immune deficiency.
