We report the 'early' conformation of the Escherichia coli signal recognition
particle (SRP) and its receptor FtsY bound to the translating ribosome, as
determined by cryo-EM. FtsY binds to the tetraloop of the SRP RNA, whereas the NG
domains of the SRP protein and FtsY interact weakly in this conformation. Our
results suggest that optimal positioning of the SRP RNA tetraloop and the Ffh NG 
domain leads to FtsY recruitment.
