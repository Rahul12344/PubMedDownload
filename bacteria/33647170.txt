Human beta defensin-1(hBD-1); an antimicrobial peptide, has immune regulatory
effects which may be involved in autoimmunity. The aims were to evaluate the
association between defensin beta 1 (DEFB1) (-44 C/G) and (-20 G/A) gene
polymorphisms with the risk of vitiligo development, the extent of the disease
and the response to NB-UVB treatment in a sample of Egyptian population. 178
active nonsegmental vitiligo patients and 182 control subjects were included in
this prospective case control study. Vitiligo extent was evaluated using vitiligo
area scoring index (VASI). Gene polymorphisms in all participants were studied by
RFLP PCR technique. Patients were treated by three narrowband UVB (NB-UVB)
treatment sessions per week. After 12 weeks, the patients were reevaluated
clinically to assess the extent of the disease using VASI scoring again and to
evaluate the type of repigmentation, if any. AA genotype of DEFB1 (-20G/A) has a 
protective role against vitiligo development, while (DEFB1 -44 C/G) GG genotype
and G allele increase the risk of vitiligo development about two folds. Patients 
carrying polymorphism in DEFB1 (-20G/A) only showed the lowest VASI scores
(14.23 ± 2.77) and the highest percentage of improvement (66.12 ± 18.01%), while 
patients carrying polymorphism in DEFB1(-44 C/G) only showed the highest baseline
VASI scores (38.87 ± 6.7) and the lowest therapeutic response (23.79 ± 19.42%)
among all patients groups. Different DEFB1 gene polymorphisms may modify the risk
of vitiligo development, the disease extent and the response to NB-UVB
phototherapy.
