BACKGROUND: The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have led to reductions in
child mortality world-wide. This has, invariably, led to the changes in the
epidemiology of diseases associated with child mortality. Although facility based
data do not capture all deaths, they provide an opportunity to confirm diagnoses 
and insight into these changes which are relevant for further disease control.
OBJECTIVE: To identify changes in the disease pattern of children who died at the
Princess Marie Louise Children's Hospital (PML) in Ghana from 2003-2013.
METHODS: A cross sectional review of mortality data was carried out at PML. The
age, sex, duration of admission and diagnosis of consecutive patients who died at
the hospital between 2003 and 2013 were reviewed. This information was entered
into an Access database and analysed using Stata 11.0 software.
RESULTS: Altogether, 1314 deaths (3.6%) occurred out of a total of 37,012
admissions. The majority of the deaths, 1187 (90.3%), occurred in children under 
the age of 5 years. While deaths caused by malaria, malnutrition, HIV infection
and diarrhoea decreased, deaths caused by pneumonia were rising. Suspected
septicaemia and meningitis showed a fluctuating trend with only a modest decrease
between 2012 and 2013. The ten leading causes of mortality among under-fives were
malnutrition, 363 (30.6%); septicaemia, 301 (25.4%); pneumonia, 218 (18.4%); HIV 
infection, 183 (15.4%); malaria, 155 (13.1%); anaemia, 135 (11.4%);
gastroenteritis/dehydration, 110 (9.3%); meningitis, 58 (4.9%); tuberculosis, 34 
(2.9%) and hypoglycaemia, 27 (2.3%). For children aged 5-9 years, the leading
causes of mortality were malaria, 42 (42.9%); HIV infection, 27 (27.6%); anaemia,
14 (14.3%); septicaemia, 12 (12.2%); meningitis, 10 (10.2%); malnutrition, 9
(9.2%); tuberculosis, 5 (5.1%); pneumonia, 4 (4.1%); encephalopathy, 3 (3.1%);
typhoid fever, 3 (3.1%) and lymphoma, 3 (3.1%). In the adolescent age group,
malaria, 8 (27.6%); anaemia, 6 (20.7%); HIV infection, 5 (17.2%); sickle cell
disease, 3 (10.3%) and meningitis, 3 (10.3%) were most common.
CONCLUSION: There has been a decline in the under-five mortality at PML over the 
years; however, deaths caused by pneumonia appear to be rising. This highlights
the need for better diagnostic services, wider HIV screening and clinical audits 
to improve outcomes in order to achieve further reductions in child mortality and
maintain the gains.
