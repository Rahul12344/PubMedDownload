Site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification of the two cysteine residues 
of the MurC L-alanine-adding enzyme from Escherichia coli were undertaken to
study their possible role in activity and stability. Their replacement by alanine
was not critical for activity. However, C230 played a role in enzyme stability
and substrate binding. N-Ethylmaleimide alkylation led to monoalkylated and
dialkylated proteins. The monoalkylated protein had mostly unmodified C230
residues. The extent of alkylation of C230 paralleled the loss of activity,
whereas that of C426 did not. Protection against inactivation by
beta,gamma-imidoadenosine 5'-triphosphate implied the involvement of C230 in the 
ATP binding site.
