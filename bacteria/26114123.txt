Background. Natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cells contribute to
the innate host defense but their role in bacterial sepsis remains controversial.
Methods. C57BL/6 mice were infected intratracheally with 5 × 10(5) cfu of
Streptococcus pneumoniae. Animals were divided into sham group (Sham); pretreated
with isotype control antibody (CON) group; pretreated with anti-asialo GM1
antibody (NKd) group; and pretreated with anti-CD1d monoclonal antibody (NKTd)
group before bacterial challenge. Serum and tissue samples were analyzed for
bacterial load, cytokine levels, splenocyte apoptosis rates, and cell
characteristics by flow cytometry. Splenocyte miRNA expression was also analyzed 
and survival was assessed. Results. NK cell depletion prolonged survival. Upon
inhibition of NKT cell activation, spleen NK (CD3-/NK1.1+) cells increased
compared to all other groups. Inhibition of NKT cell activation led to higher
bacterial loads and increased levels of serum and splenocyte IFN-γ. Splenocyte
miRNA analysis showed that miR-200c and miR-29a were downregulated, while
miR-125a-5p was upregulated, in anti-CD1d treated animals. These changes were
moderate after NK cell depletion. Conclusions. NK cells appear to contribute to
mortality in pneumococcal pneumonia. Inhibition of NKT cell activation resulted
in an increase in spleen NK (CD3-/NK1.1+) cells and a higher IFN-γ production,
while altering splenocyte miRNA expression.
