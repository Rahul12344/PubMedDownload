Arginine-specific cysteine proteinases (gingipains-R) from periodontopathic
Porphyromonas gingivalis cleaved CD14, a bacterial pattern recognition receptor, 
on human gingival fibroblasts (HGF). Consequently, gingipains-R reduced
lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-8 production by HGF, indicating that
gingipains-R inhibited CD14-dependent HGF activation and are involved in immune
evasion by the bacterium in periodontal tissues.
