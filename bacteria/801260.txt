Dodin A, Galimand M.

The effects of different combinations of quaternary ammonium compounds
(Sanitized, Sanigard) on faecal and soil organisms demonstrate the usefulness of 
these products (dilution 1/100,000). A contact time of 30 seconds to 4 minutes is
sufficient for bacteriocidal activity. Materials treated with these compounds
retain their bacteriocidal activity after 10 washes with boiling water and for
over a month with normal usage. The disinfection of a door handle contaminated
with Vibrio cholerae or Salmonella typhi destroys these bacteriae after 30
seconds and prevents re-contamination for a month. Therefore, they are very
useful in the control of diseases caused by bad hygiene.
