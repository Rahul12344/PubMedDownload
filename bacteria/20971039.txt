T cell-mediated adaptive immune response is controlled by both positive
costimulation and negative coinhibition, generated mainly by the interaction
between the B7 family and their receptor CD28 family. Coinhibition is exploited
by prostate cancer as an immune evasion pathway. Overexpression of coinhibitory
B7x and B7-H3 in prostate cancer correlates with poor disease outcome, whereas
tumor-infiltrating immune cells have enhanced expression of PD-L1 and its
receptor PD-1. New insights into the complex mechanisms governing B7 expression
in the tumor microenvironment have been reported and therapies aimed at
overcoming T cell coinhibition with antagonistic monoclonal antibodies are
emerging as effective tumor immunotherapies. Therapies that block B7x and B7-H3, 
either as monotherapies or in synergism with traditional therapies, should be
pursued.
