Substantial evidence shows that neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue growth is
dependent on angiogenesis. Neovascularization and adipogenesis are temporally and
spatially coupled processes during prenatal life and they continue to
reciprocally interact via paracrine signaling systems throughout adult life.
Activated adipocytes produce multiple angiogenic factors including leptin,
angiopoietins, HGF, GM-CSF, VEGF, FGF-2, and TGF-beta, which either alone or
collectively stimulate neovascularization during fat mass expansion. Thus
antiangiogenic agents provide a novel therapeutic option for prevention and
treatment of human obesity and its related disorders.
