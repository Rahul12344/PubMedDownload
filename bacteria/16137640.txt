OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyse the antibacterial effects of
Emdogain Gel or its constituents on the growth of the suspected
periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis.
STUDY DESIGN: The effects of the proteins of enamel matrix derivative (EMD), the 
commercial product Emdogain Gel or its vehicle propylene glycol alginate (PGA)
(Straumann, Switzerland) on P. gingivalis growth were determined by two methods: 
broth dilution assay (BDA) and agar diffusion assay (ADA).
RESULTS: BDA-Emdogain Gel inhibited moderately the growth of P. gingivalis,
whereas EMD showed no effect. The PGA vehicle inhibited the growth completely.
ADA-Emdogain Gel resulted in some inhibition in growth but was not significantly 
different from control. EMD revealed no zone of inhibition. PGA demonstrated
statistically significant zones of inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Emdogain Gel shows moderate antibacterial activities against P.
gingivalis. These properties seem to be due to the PGA component of the gel
preparation.
