MutY glycosylase excises adenines misincorporated opposite the oxidatively
damaged lesion, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG), to initiate base excision repair
and prevent G to T transversion mutations. Successful repair requires MutY
recognition of the OG:A mispair amidst highly abundant and structurally similar
undamaged DNA base pairs. Herein we use a combination of in vitro and bacterial
cell repair assays with single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate
that both a C-terminal domain histidine residue and the 2-amino group of OG base 
are critical for MutY detection of OG:A sites. These studies are the first to
directly link deficiencies in MutY lesion detection with incomplete cellular
repair. These results suggest that defects in lesion detection of human MutY
(MUTYH) variants may prove predictive of early-onset colorectal cancer known an
MUTYH-associated polyposis. Furthermore, unveiling these specific molecular
determinants for repair makes it possible to envision new MUTYH-specific cancer
therapies.
