OBJECTIVE: To report clinical, laboratory and radiologic manifestations in 2
infants with osteomyelitis of the odontoid process (dens).
BACKGROUND: Vertebral osteomyelitis is uncommon, and osteomyelitis of the dens
has rarely been reported in the pediatric population.
METHODS: The medical records of 2 infants diagnosed with dens osteomyelitis were 
reviewed.
RESULTS: Both infants had fever, which resolved spontaneously before admission.
Both were nontoxic appearing with persistent neck stiffness and torticollis.
White blood count and C-reactive protein were only mildly elevated in both cases.
Blood cultures were sterile. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the diagnosis.
They both fully recovered.
CONCLUSIONS: We report 2 cases of dens osteomyelitis. These cases emphasize the
need to consider C1-C2 osteomyelitis in the differential diagnosis of neck
stiffness and torticollis.
