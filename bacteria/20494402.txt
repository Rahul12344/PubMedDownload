The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of cattle manure compost
(CMC) to degrade 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT). DDT was
degraded during composting and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD)
was detected as a metabolic product. Degradation of DDT at 60 degrees C was the
most effective of all the stages of composting. Fourteen strains of fungi were
isolated and identified from CMC, and most of them were closely related to Mucor 
circinelloides and Galactomyces geotrichum. These fungi demonstrated a high
ability to degrade DDT both at 30 and 60 degrees C in potato dextrose broth (PDB)
medium. DDD and 4,4-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP) were detected as metabolic
products. Degradation of DDT-contaminated soil was also investigated. Composting 
materials in the mesophilic stage exhibited the highest ability to degrade DDT in
un-sterilized (USL) contaminated soil during a 28d incubation period. The
isolated fungi possessed the ability to degrade DDT in sterilized (SL) and
un-sterilized (USL) soils. These results indicated that CMC contains fungi that
can be potentially used for bioremediation in DDT-contaminated environments.
