BACKGROUND: Currently, there is no agreed standard for exploring the
antimicrobial activity of wound antiseptics in a phase 2/ step 2 test protocol.
In the present study, a standardised in-vitro test is proposed, which allows to
test potential antiseptics in a more realistically simulation of conditions found
in wounds as in a suspension test. Furthermore, factors potentially influencing
test results such as type of materials used as test carrier or various
compositions of organic soil challenge were investigated in detail.
METHODS: This proposed phase 2/ step 2 test method was modified on basis of the
EN 14561 by drying the microbial test suspension on a metal carrier for 1 h,
overlaying the test wound antiseptic, washing-off, neutralization, and dispersion
at serial dilutions at the end of the required exposure time yielded
reproducible, consistent test results.
RESULTS: The difference between the rapid onset of the antiseptic effect of PVP-I
and the delayed onset especially of polihexanide was apparent. Among
surface-active antimicrobial compounds, octenidine was more effective than
chlorhexidine digluconate and polihexanide, with some differences depending on
the test organisms. However, octenidine and PVP-I were approximately equivalent
in efficiency and microbial spectrum, while polihexanide required longer exposure
times or higher concentrations for a comparable antimicrobial efficacy.
CONCLUSION: Overall, this method allowed testing and comparing differ liquid and 
gel based antimicrobial compounds in a standardised setting.
