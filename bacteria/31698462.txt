Recent work has identified distinct molecular subgroups of acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with implications for disease classification and prognosis. AML with
mutated NPM1 (AML-NPM1) represents a distinct entity in the revised 2017 World
Health Organization classification, but relatively little work has examined the
clinical significance of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity within this group. 
A multi-institutional cohort of 239 AML-NPM1 cases included 3 phenotypic groups: 
cases with blasts showing monocytic differentiation (n = 93; monocytic AML-NPM1),
cases lacking monocytic differentiation (n = 72; myeloid AML-NPM1), and cases
where blasts were negative for both CD34 and HLA-DR (n = 74; double-negative [DN]
AML-NPM1). Genotypic diversity typical of AML-NPM1 was seen, with comutations
occurring most commonly in DNA methylation genes (81% of cases), FLT3 (48%;
including internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain mutations), and 
RAS pathway genes (30%). However, the comutation pattern differed by blast
phenotype. TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations were significantly more common in DN
AML-NPM1 (96% of cases) than in myeloid (39%) or monocytic AML-NPM1 (48%; P <
.0001). Conversely, DNMT3A mutations were significantly less common in DN
AML-NPM1 (27%) than in myeloid (44%) or monocytic cases (54%; P = .002).
Furthermore, the 3 phenotypic groups showed significant differences in outcome,
with DN AML-NPM1 showing significantly longer relapse-free (RFS) and overall
survival (OS) (64.7 and 66.5 months, respectively) than monocytic AML-NPM1 (RFS, 
20.6 months; OS, 44.3 months) or myeloid AML-NPM1 (RFS, 8.4 months; OS, 20.2
months; P < .0001 and P = .01 for RFS and OS, respectively). Our findings
highlight biologic differences within immunophenotypically defined subgroups of
NPM1-mutated AML that may impart prognostic significance.
