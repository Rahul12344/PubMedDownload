The increasing incidence of infections with multi-drug resistant Enterococcus
faecium necessitates studies to increase knowledge on the pathogenesis of these
infections. In this study, the contribution of peritoneal macrophages during E.
faecium peritonitis was investigated. In an ex vivo setting, peritoneal
macrophages harvested from C57BL/6 mice were responsive to, and able to
phagocytose and kill, E. faecium. In vivo, peritoneal macrophages were depleted
by intraperitoneal injection of clodronate-encapsulated liposomes, prior to
inducing E. faecium peritonitis. Depletion of resident peritoneal macrophages
caused a clear delay in peritoneal clearance of E. faecium with increased
systemic dissemination. Mice depleted of peritoneal macrophages were able to
recruit macrophages and neutrophils to the peritoneal cavity after infection,
comparable to control mice. Furthermore, increased levels of peritoneal cytokines
and chemokines were found in mice depleted of peritoneal macrophages. This study 
indicates that peritoneal macrophages are important in the early containment of
E. faecium peritonitis and for the regulation of the inflammatory response.
