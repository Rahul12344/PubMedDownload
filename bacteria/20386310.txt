OBJECTIVE: The receptor for advanced glycation end products mediates a variety of
inflammatory responses. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products has 
been suggested to function as a decoy abrogating cellular activation.
High-mobility group box 1 is a high-affinity binding ligand for the receptor for 
advanced glycation end products with cytokine activities and plays a role in
sepsis.
DESIGN: Controlled, in vivo laboratory study.
SETTING: Research laboratory of a health sciences university.
SUBJECTS: C57BL/6 mice.
INTERVENTIONS: Peritonitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of
Escherichia coli. Mice received soluble receptor for advanced glycation end
products or anti-high-mobility group box 1 immunoglobulin G, or the appropriate
control treatment.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end
products-treated mice demonstrated an enhanced bacterial dissemination to liver
and lungs, accompanied by increased hepatocellular injury and exaggerated
systemic cytokine release, 20 hrs after intraperitoneal administration of
Escherichia coli. Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products
administration in healthy, uninfected mice did not induce an immune response.
Remarkably, lung inflammation was unaffected. Furthermore, high-mobility group
box 1 release was enhanced during peritonitis and anti-high-mobility group box 1 
treatment was associated with higher bacterial loads in liver and lungs.
CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to suggest that receptor for advanced
glycation end products ligands, including high-mobility group box 1, limit
bacterial dissemination during Gram-negative sepsis.
