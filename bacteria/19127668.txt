The susceptibility status of Xenopsylla cheopis, the efficient vector of human
plague in India was assessed in erstwhile plague endemic areas of Nilgiris
district, Tamil Nadu following standard WHO techniques. The studies revealed the 
development of resistance in rat fleas to DDT--4.0%, Malathion--5.0%,
Deltamethrin--0.05% and tolerance to Permethrin--0.75% in all the four blocks of 
Nilgiris hill district. Development of resistance may be due to the extensive use
of insecticides in tea plantations and agricultural sectors where the
domestic/peri-domestic rodents find their natural habitats and intermingle with
each other.
