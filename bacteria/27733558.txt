Genetic diseases of blood cells are prime candidates for treatment through ex
vivo gene editing of CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and a
variety of technologies have been proposed to treat these disorders. Sickle cell 
disease (SCD) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a single-nucleotide
polymorphism in the β-globin gene (HBB). Sickle hemoglobin damages erythrocytes, 
causing vasoocclusion, severe pain, progressive organ damage, and premature
death. We optimize design and delivery parameters of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
complex comprising Cas9 protein and unmodified single guide RNA, together with a 
single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide donor (ssODN), to enable efficient
replacement of the SCD mutation in human HSPCs. Corrected HSPCs from SCD patients
produced less sickle hemoglobin RNA and protein and correspondingly increased
wild-type hemoglobin when differentiated into erythroblasts. When engrafted into 
immunocompromised mice, ex vivo treated human HSPCs maintain SCD gene edits
throughout 16 weeks at a level likely to have clinical benefit. These results
demonstrate that an accessible approach combining Cas9 RNP with an ssODN can
mediate efficient HSPC genome editing, enables investigator-led exploration of
gene editing reagents in primary hematopoietic stem cells, and suggests a path
toward the development of new gene editing treatments for SCD and other
hematopoietic diseases.
