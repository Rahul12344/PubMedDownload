p97, also known as valosin-containing protein (VCP) or Cdc48, plays a central
role in cellular protein homeostasis. Human p97 mutations are associated with
several neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting p97 and its cofactors is a strategy
for cancer drug development. Despite significant structural insights into the
fungal homolog Cdc48, little is known about how human p97 interacts with its
cofactors. Recently, the anti-alcohol abuse drug disulfiram was found to target
cancer through Npl4, a cofactor of p97, but the molecular mechanism remains
elusive. Here, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we
uncovered three Npl4 conformational states in complex with human p97 before ATP
hydrolysis. The motion of Npl4 results from its zinc finger motifs interacting
with the N domain of p97, which is essential for the unfolding activity of p97.
In vitro and cell-based assays showed that the disulfiram derivative
bis-(diethyldithiocarbamate)-copper (CuET) can bypass the copper transporter
system and inhibit the function of p97 in the cytoplasm by releasing cupric ions 
under oxidative conditions, which disrupt the zinc finger motifs of Npl4, locking
the essential conformational switch of the complex.
