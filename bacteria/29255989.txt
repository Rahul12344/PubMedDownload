Escherichia coli KO11 is a popular ethanologenic strain, but is more sensitive to
ethanol than other producers. Here, an ethanol-tolerant mutant EM was isolated
from ultraviolet mutagenesis library of KO11. Comparative genomic analysis added 
by piecewise knockout strategy and complementation assay revealed EKO11_3023
(espA) within the 36.6-kb deletion from KO11 was the only locus responsible for
ethanol sensitivity. Interestingly, when espA was deleted in strain W (the parent
strain of KO11), ethanol tolerance was dramatically elevated to the level of
espA-free hosts [e.g., MG1655 and BL21(DE3)]. And overexpression of espA in
strains MG1655 and BL21(DE3) led to significantly enhanced ethanol sensitivity.
In addition to ethanol, deletion of espA also improved cell tolerance to other
short-chain (C2-C4) alcohols, including methanol, isopropanol, n-butanol,
isobutanol and 2-butanol. Therefore, espA was responsible for short-chain alcohol
sensitivity of W-strains compared to other cells, which provides a potential
engineering target for alcohols production.
