The 1.2-kb DNA fragment upstream of the linked beta-hbd (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase) and adh1 (NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase) genes from
Clostridium acetobutylicum P262 was sequenced. The upstream region contained an
open reading frame (ORFB) which was found to have 44% amino acid identity to the 
fixB gene products of Rhizobium and Azorhizobium. The beta-hbd and ORFB genes
were expressed during the acidogenic and solventogenic phases. The beta-hbd gene 
was transcribed on a single mRNA species of 2.0 kb, whereas the ORFB gene was
transcribed on two species of mRNA of 2.0 and 3.5 kb, respectively. The adh1 gene
was induced or derepressed at the pH breakpoint before the onset of
solventogenesis and was transcribed on a single species of mRNA of 2.4 kb.
