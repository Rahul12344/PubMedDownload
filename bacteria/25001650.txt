Human mast cells (first described in 1879 by Paul Ehrlich) develop from committed
precursors in the bone marrow expressing the differentiation marker CD34+ and
distinct from the three other myeloid cells. Mast cells are present in various
tissues especially near blood vessels, epithelia and nerves and they are
activated by cross-linking of Fc&#949;RI, but also by a number of neuropeptides. 
NGF mediates a number of inflammatory and autoimmune states in conjunction with
an increased accumulation of mast cells which appear to be involved in
neuroimmune interactions and tissue inflammation. Here we report some
relationships between mast cells and nerve growth factor (NGF).
