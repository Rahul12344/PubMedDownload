The ability of human beta-defensins hBD-1, hBD-2, and hBD-3 to exert direct in
vitro antimicrobial effects was evaluated using Francisella tularensis Live
Vaccine Strain (LVS) and Francisella novicida. While hBD-2 showed some
antimicrobial activity in these assays, only hBD-3 demonstrated significant
potency against Francisella. Francisella tularensis LVS infection induced
elevated levels of hBD-2 mRNA in human airway epithelial (A549) cells, while
having no significant impact on the levels of hBD-3 and only a moderate effect on
the level of hBD-1 mRNA. Francisella infection avoided stimulating the production
of the most potent anti-Francisella host peptide, hBD-3, in A549 cells, although 
hBD-3 is stimulated by other treatments. The differential induction of
beta-defensins in Francisella infected lung epithelial cells suggests a complex
dynamic in the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the innate immune
response.
