The bioremediation of a long-term contaminated soil through biostimulation and
surfactant addition was evaluated. The concentrations of
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) and its metabolites
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD) and
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) were monitored during an
8-week remediation process. Physicochemical characterization of the treated soil 
was performed before and after the bioremediation process. The isolation and
identification of predominant microorganisms during the remediation process were 
also carried out. The efficiency of detoxification was evaluated after each
bioremediation protocol. Humidity and pH and the heterotrophic microorganism
count were monitored weekly. The DDT concentration was reduced by 79% after 8
weeks via biostimulation with surfactant addition (B+S) and 94.3% via
biostimulation alone (B). Likewise, the concentrations of the metabolites DDE and
DDD were reduced to levels below the quantification limits. The microorganisms
isolated during bioremediation were identified as Bacillus thuringiensis,
Flavobacterium sp., Cuprivadius sp., Variovorax soli, Phenylobacterium sp. and
Lysobacter sp., among others. Analysis with scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
allowed visualization of the colonization patterns of soil particles. The
toxicity of the soil before and after bioremediation was evaluated using Vibrio
fischeri as a bioluminescent sensor. A decrease in the toxic potential of the
soil was verified by the increase of the concentration/effect relationship EC50
to 26.9% and 27.2% for B+S and B, respectively, compared to 0.4% obtained for the
soil before treatment and 2.5% by natural attenuation after 8 weeks of treatment.
