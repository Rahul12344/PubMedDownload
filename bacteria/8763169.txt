Bare and Pt/Ir/C-coated DNA has been analysed using scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM). To achieve reproducible imaging of bare DNA on mica
ethanol/air-dried molecules were embedded in Pt/C. By peeling the metal film off 
the mica, the previously mica-exposed side of the Pt/C-film with the embedded DNA
molecules was accessible for STM analysis. By applying this replica/anchoring
technique only hollow trenches in the metal film, and not the DNA itself, could
be visualized. The gaps averaged 3.1 nm (+/- 0.9 nm) wide and 1 nm (+/- 0.5 nm)
deep. Using scanning force microscopy it could be confirmed that the DNA remained
in the Pt/C film during the peel-off procedure. For STM, DNA fragments were also 
coated with 0.7-1 nm Pt/Ir/C. Owing to the high Z-resolution the STM samples were
coated at a high elevation angle (65 degrees), thereby minimizing the problem of 
self-shadowing. Coating by Pt/Ir/C allowed routine imaging and quantitative
analysis of both ethanol/air- and freeze-dried DNA under atmospheric conditions. 
After ethanol/air drying measured values for DNA width and height were 5.1 nm
(+/- 1.8 nm) and 0.9 nm (+/- 0.2 nm), respectively. Freeze-dried DNA averaged 4.2
nm (+/- 1.3 nm) wide and 1.1 nm (+/- 0.1 nm) high. A Pt/Ir/C-coating was also
applied to visualize DNA-protein interaction using STM.
