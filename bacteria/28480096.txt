BACKGROUND: The genes encoding IL9, IL9R, IL17A, and IL17F have recently been
implicated in the genetic basis of rhinitis and allergy.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to assess the association of the single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of IL9, IL9R, IL17A, and IL17F and potential
interaction of these genes with the determination of IgE levels in women with
allergic rhinitis (AR) in Shahrekord, Iran.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a case-control study, SNPs from the IL9, IL9R, IL17A,
and IL17F were genotyped in 394 random samples including 195 AR patients and 199 
normal controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed for the
determination of serum total IgE levels. The Student's t-test was used to compare
the differences. The Chi-square test was performed to compare proportions of
cases with different clinical features among cases with different genotypes. The 
genotype and allele frequencies were obtained by direct counting. Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium was tested between cases and controls separately. The relative risk
associated with rare alleles was estimated as an odds ratio with 95% confidence
interval. P â‰¤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: The rs731476 SNP in the IL9R was significantly associated with the AR
phenotype in women. No association was found between any of the other SNPs in
IL9, IL17A, and IL17F genes and AR. In the gene-gene interaction analysis, we
found that IL9R/IL9 genotype rs731476 T-/rs2069885 G conferred a higher risk for 
AR phenotype development. We also did not find a significant association in terms
of IgE levels between cases and controls.
CONCLUSION: Our result suggests that the rs731476 SNP located in the IL9R is
associated with an increased susceptibility to AR in females. In a subsequent
gene-gene interaction analysis, the rs731476 T-/rs2069885 G-genotype combination 
(IL9R/IL9) has significantly been associated with the development of the AR
phenotype.
