Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces insecticidal proteins that are either
secreted during the vegetative growth phase or accumulated in the crystal
inclusions (Cry proteins) in the stationary phase. Cry1I proteins share the three
domain (3D) structure typical of crystal proteins but are secreted to the media
early in the stationary growth phase. In the generally accepted mode of action of
3D Cry proteins (sequential binding model), the formation of an oligomer
(tetramer) has been described as a major step, necessary for pore formation and
subsequent toxicity. To know if this could be extended to Cry1I proteins, the
formation of Cry1Ia oligomers was studied by Western blot, after the incubation
of trypsin activated Cry1Ia with insect brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) or 
insect cultured cells, using Cry1Ab as control. Our results showed that Cry1Ia
oligomers were observed only after incubation with susceptible coleopteran BBMV, 
but not following incubation with susceptible lepidopteran BBMV or
non-susceptible Sf21 insect cells, while Cry1Ab oligomers were persistently
detected after incubation with all insect tissues tested, regardless of its host 
susceptibility. The data suggested oligomerization may not necessarily be a
requirement for the toxicity of Cry1I proteins.
