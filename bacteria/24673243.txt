The impact of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) with carbon chain length C2 to C8
on the dissolution, aggregation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and
toxicity of citrate-coated AgNPs was investigated under UV irradiation. The
presence of PFCAs decreased dissolution, aggregation, ROS generation, and
toxicity of AgNPs because the negatively charged PFCAs sorbed on AgNP surface
enhanced their stability. Both dissolution and aggregation rate of AgNPs
decreased with chain length of PFCAs under UV irradiation, primarily because
PFCAs with longer chain length sorbed on AgNP surface could form thicker
coatings. The dissolution of AgNPs followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the 
rate constant decreased from 0.58 h(-1) with C2 to 0.30 h(-1) with C8. The
hydrodynamic diameters of AgNPs linearly increased under UV irradiation with
aggregation rates ranged from 72.1 to 143.5 nm/h. O2(â€¢-) generation was observed 
in AgNP suspension with quantum yield of 0.12%, but was completely suppressed by 
PFCAs because they inhibited the interaction between photoelectrons and O2. A
linear correlation was established between dissolved Ag(+) and bacterial survival
rates of AgNPs with and without PFCAs under UV irradiation. This study highlights
the necessity of considering coexisting organic contaminants when investigating
the environmental behaviors of AgNPs.
