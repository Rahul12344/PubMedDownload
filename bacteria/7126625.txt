Isolation of an unusual 'lipid A' type glycolipid from Pseudomonas paucimobilis.

Kawahara K, Uchida K, Aida K.

A new glycolipid was isolated from defatted cells of Pseudomonas paucimobilis IAM
12576, and called 'bound lipid'. The 'bound lipid' could not be extracted by hot 
phenol extraction, but could be extracted with hot chloroform/methanol after
hydrolysis with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The 'bound lipid' was purified by
thin-layer chromatography on silica gel plates using the solvent mixture
CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOOH/ H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v). It consisted of glucosamine,
2-hydroxy myristic acid, galactose, mannose and uronic acid with ratios of
1.0:0.75:0.77:0.44:1.5, respectively, and other fatty acids besides 2-hydroxy
myristic acid were not detected in the 'bound lipid'. 2-Hydroxy myristic acid was
probably bound to glucosamine residues by amide linkage, because mild alkali
treatment did not liberate the fatty acid. From these results, we discussed the
possibility that the 'bound lipid' was some kind of lipid A of this bacteria.
