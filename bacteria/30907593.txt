Karamomycins A-C (2-4), the first natural 2-naphthalen-2-yl-thiazole derivatives,
were isolated along with a plausible precursor molecule,
1-hydroxy-4-methoxy-2-naphthoic acid (1), uracil, 1-acetyl-β-carboline, and
actinomycin C2 from the culture broth of the terrestrial actinomycete strain
GW58/450, identified as Nonomuraea endophytica. These compounds were
characterized by analysis of their NMR and mass spectrometry (MS) data; the
absolute configurations of 2 and 4 were determined by comparison of 13C NMR,
NOESY, and circular dichroism (CD) spectra with density functional theory
(DFT)-calculated data. In karamomycin C (4), the thiazole of 2 is connected to an
unusual iminothiazolo[4,3- c][1,4]thiazepinone, for which we proposed a
biosynthetic origin from two cysteine residues. It is closely related to ulbactin
F; however, the heterocycle is enantiomeric to the latter and connected to phenol
instead of 4-methoxy-1-naphthol. Karamomycins A (2) and C (4) were cytotoxic.
