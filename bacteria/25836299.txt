T follicular helper (Tfh) cells provide essential help to B cells for the
generation of high-affinity antibodies. These mechanisms provide the basis for
the success of modern vaccines, but dysregulated Tfh cell responses are also
linked to autoimmune diseases. In addition to their established role in driving
humoral immunity, Tfh cells are gaining attention for their role in other
processes of the adaptive immune system. For example, Tfh cells may serve as
transitional differentiation intermediates during effector and memory T-helper
cell differentiation and as a reservoir of HIV-infected cells. While B cells are 
required for the full maturation and maintenance of Tfh cell responses, they are 
dispensable for the initial induction of the Tfh cell phenotype, which occurs at 
the priming stage through interaction with dendritic cells. Nevertheless, the
precise mechanisms of these early events during Tfh cell differentiation remain
relatively unknown. Here, we describe a method for tracking early Tfh cell
differentiation by following cell division kinetics and phenotypic changes of
recently activated antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells in vivo. As an example, we use
this method to visualize the requirements for T cell-expressed CD28 for the
differentiation of CXCR5(+)Bcl6(+) Tfh cells.
