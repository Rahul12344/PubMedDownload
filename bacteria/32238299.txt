BACKGROUND AIMS: Key obstacles in human iNKT cell translational research and
immunotherapy include the lack of robust protocols for dependable expansion of
human iNKT cells and the paucity of data on phenotypes in post-expanded cells.
METHODS: We delineate expansion methods using interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7 and
allogeneic feeder cells and anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation by which to dependably 
augment Th2 polarization and direct cytotoxicity of human peripheral blood
CD3+Vα24+Vβ11+ iNKT cells.
RESULTS: Gene and protein expression profiling demonstrated augmented Th2
cytokine secretion (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) in expanded iNKT cells stimulated with
anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 antibodies. Cytotoxic effector molecules including granzyme B
were increased in expanded iNKT cells after CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation. Direct
cytotoxicity assays using unstimulated expanded iNKT cell effectors revealed
α-galactosyl ceramide (α-GalCer)-dependent killing of the T-ALL cell line Jurkat.
Moreover, CD2/CD3/CD28 stimulation of expanded iNKT cells augmented their
(α-GalCer-independent) killing of Jurkat cells. Co-culture of expanded iNKT cells
with stimulated responder cells confirmed contact-dependent inhibition of
activated CD4+ and CD8+ responder T cells.
DISCUSSION: These data establish a robust protocol to expand and novel pathways
to enhance Th2 cytokine secretion and direct cytotoxicity in human iNKT cells,
findings with direct implications for autoimmunity, vaccine augmentation and
anti-infective immunity, cancer immunotherapy and transplantation.
