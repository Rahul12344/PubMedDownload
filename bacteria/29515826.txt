Sophorolipid biosurfactants are biodegradable, less toxic and FDA approved. The
purified acidic form of sophorolipid is stimuli-responsive with self-assembling
properties and used for solubilizing hydrophobic drugs. This study encapsulated
curcumin (CU) with acidic sophorolipid (ASL) micelles and analysed using
photophysical studies like UV-visible spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL)
spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). TEM images have 
revealed ellipsoid micelles of approximately 100â€‰nm size and were confirmed by
dynamic light scattering. The bacterial fluorescence uptake studies showed the
uptake of formed CUASL nanostructures into both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria. They also showed quorum quenching activity against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The results have demonstrated this system has potential theranostic
applications.
