Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the endosteum of mesoderm-derived appendicular
bones have been extensively studied. Neural crest-derived bones differ from
appendicular bones in developmental origin, mode of bone formation and
pathological bone resorption. Whether neural crest-derived bones harbor HSCs is
elusive. Here, we discovered HSC-like cells in postnatal murine mandible, and
benchmarked them with donor-matched, mesoderm-derived femur/tibia HSCs, including
clonogenic assay and long-term culture. Mandibular CD34 negative, LSK cells
proliferated similarly to appendicular HSCs, and differentiated into all
hematopoietic lineages. Mandibular HSCs showed a consistent deficiency in
lymphoid differentiation, including significantly fewer CD229 + fractions,
PreProB, ProB, PreB and B220 + slgM cells. Remarkably, mandibular HSCs
reconstituted irradiated hematopoietic bone marrow in vivo, just as appendicular 
HSCs. Genomic profiling of osteoblasts from mandibular and femur/tibia bone
marrow revealed deficiencies in several HSC niche regulators among mandibular
osteoblasts including Cxcl12. Neural crest derived bone harbors HSCs that
function similarly to appendicular HSCs but are deficient in the lymphoid
lineage. Thus, lymphoid deficiency of mandibular HSCs may be accounted by
putative niche regulating genes. HSCs in craniofacial bones have functional
implications in homeostasis, osteoclastogenesis, immune functions, tumor
metastasis and infections such as osteonecrosis of the jaw.
