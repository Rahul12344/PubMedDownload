BACKGROUND: Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has emerged as a pivotal
mediator of innate immunity and has been shown to be an important effector
molecule in severe sepsis. Melioidosis, caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, is
an important cause of community-acquired sepsis in Southeast-Asia. We aimed to
characterize the expression and function of MIF in melioidosis.
METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: MIF expression was determined in leukocytes
and plasma from 34 melioidosis patients and 32 controls, and in mice infected
with B. pseudomallei. MIF function was investigated in experimental murine
melioidosis using anti-MIF antibodies and recombinant MIF. Patients demonstrated 
markedly increased MIF mRNA leukocyte and MIF plasma concentrations. Elevated MIF
concentrations were associated with mortality. Mice inoculated intranasally with 
B. pseudomallei displayed a robust increase in pulmonary and systemic MIF
expression. Anti-MIF treated mice showed lower bacterial loads in their lungs
upon infection with a low inoculum. Conversely, mice treated with recombinant MIF
displayed a modestly impaired clearance of B. pseudomallei. MIF exerted no direct
effects on bacterial outgrowth or phagocytosis of B. pseudomallei.
CONCLUSIONS: MIF concentrations are markedly elevated during clinical melioidosis
and correlate with patients' outcomes. In experimental melioidosis MIF impaired
antibacterial defense.
