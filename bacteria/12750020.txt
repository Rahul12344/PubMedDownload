Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is an essential enzyme in Coenzyme 
A biosynthesis. Because bacterial PPAT and mammalian PPAT are dissimilar, this
enzyme is an attractive antibacterial target. Based on the structure of the
substrate, 4-phosphopantetheine, a dipeptide library was designed, synthesised
and tested against Escherichia coli PPAT. The most potent inhibitor PTX040334 was
co-crystallised with E. coli PPAT. With this structural information, a rational
iterative medicinal chemistry program was initiated, aimed at increasing the
number of inhibitor-enzyme interactions. A very potent and specific inhibitor,
PTX042695, with an IC(50) of 6 nM against E.coli PPAT, but with no activity
against porcine PPAT, was obtained.
