A microarray method for the deposition of bacteria onto an agar slide was
developed to accelerate the formation of microcolonies. Representative
microarrays each consisting of 40 micro-spots of five replicates of eight
foodborne bacteria (Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella
typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were printed on a Brain Heart
Infusion (BHI) agar slide using a contact micro-spotting robotic system. Within 3
h, sufficient bacterial cells were obtained to allow accurate identification of
the microorganism by infrared spectroscopy. This approach allows a
"complete-in-a-single-day" analysis of a large array of samples.
