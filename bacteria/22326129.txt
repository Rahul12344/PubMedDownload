BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) restores the
inflammatory immune response in AIDS patients and it may unmask previous
subclinical infections or paradoxically exacerbate symptoms of opportunistic
infections. Up to 25% of patients receiving HAART develop immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). We describe six patients with IRIS central nervous 
system (CNSIRIS) manifestations emphasizing the relevance of CSF cultures and
neuroimaging in early diagnosis and management.
METHODS: Patients with CNSIRIS were identified among hospitalized HIV-infected
patients that started HAART from January 2002 through December 2007 at a referral
neurological center in Mexico.
RESULTS: One-hundred and forty-two HIV-infected patients with neurological signs 
were hospitalized, 64 of which had received HAART, and six (9.3%) developed
CNSIRIS. Five patients were male. Two cases of tuberculosis, two of
cryptococcosis, one of brain toxoplasmosis, and one possible PML case were found.
IRIS onset occurred within 12 weeks of HAART in five patients. Anti-infective
therapy was continued. In one case, HAART was temporarily suspended. In long-term
follow-up the clinical condition improved in all patients.
CONCLUSIONS: CNSIRIS associated to opportunistic infections appeared in 9% of
patients receiving HAART. Interestingly, no cases of malignancy or neoplasm
IRIS-related were found. Frequent clinical assessment and neuroimaging studies
supported diagnosis and treatment. Risk factors were similar to those found in
other series.
