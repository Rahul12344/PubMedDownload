PMN are critical to innate immunity and are fundamental to antibacterial defense.
To localize to sites of infection, PMN possess receptors that detect
chemoattractant stimuli elicited at the site, such as chemokines, complement
split products, or bioactive lipids. Signaling through these receptors stimulates
chemotaxis toward the site of infection but also activates a number of
biochemical processes, with the result that PMN kill invading bacteria. PMN
possess two receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, for the N-terminal ELR motif-containing
CXC chemokines, although only two chemokine members bind both receptors and the
remainder binding only CXCR2. This peculiar pattern in receptor specificity has
drawn considerable interest and investigation into whether signaling through each
receptor might impart unique properties on the PMN. Indeed, at first glance,
CXCR1 and CXCR2 appear to be functionally redundant; however, there are
differences. Considering these proinflammatory activities of activating PMN
through chemokine receptors, there has been great interest in the possibility
that blocking CXCR1 and CXCR2 on PMN will provide a therapeutic benefit. The
literature examining CXCR1 and CXCR2 in PMN function during human and modeled
diseases will be reviewed, asking whether the functional differences can be
perceived based on alterations in the role PMN play in these processes.
