Progressive renal failure causes uremia-related immune dysfunction, which
features a chronic inflammatory milieu. Given the central role of end-stage renal
disease (ESRD)-related immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
diseases (CVDs), much attention has been focused on how uremic toxins affect
cellular immunity and the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
in ESRD patients. Here, we investigated the characteristics of monocytes and CD4+
T cells in ESRD patients and the immune responses induced by indoxyl sulfate
(IS), a key uremic toxin, in order to explore the pathogenic effects of these
cells on vascular endothelial cells. In ESRD patients, monocytes respond to IS
through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and consequently produce increased
levels of TNF-α. Upon stimulation with TNF-α, human vascular endothelial cells
produce copious amounts of CX3CL1, a chemokine ligand of CX3CR1 that is highly
expressed on CD4+CD28-T cells, the predominantly expanded cell type in ESRD
patients. A migration assay showed that CD4+CD28- T cells were preferentially
recruited by CX3CL1. Moreover, activated CD4+CD28- T cells exhibited cytotoxic
capability allowing for the induction of apoptosis in HUVECs. Our findings
suggest that in ESRD, IS-mediated immune dysfunction may cause vascular
endothelial cell damage and thus, this toxin plays a pivotal role in the
pathogenesis of CVD.
