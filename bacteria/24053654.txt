BACKGROUND: Glycolic acid is a C2 hydroxy acid that is a widely used chemical
compound. It can be polymerised to produce biodegradable polymers with excellent 
gas barrier properties. Currently, glycolic acid is produced in a chemical
process using fossil resources and toxic chemicals. Biotechnological production
of glycolic acid using renewable resources is a desirable alternative.
RESULTS: The yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces lactis are
suitable organisms for glycolic acid production since they are acid tolerant and 
can grow in the presence of up to 50 g l(-1) glycolic acid. We engineered S.
cerevisiae and K. lactis for glycolic acid production using the reactions of the 
glyoxylate cycle to produce glyoxylic acid and then reducing it to glycolic acid.
The expression of a high affinity glyoxylate reductase alone already led to
glycolic acid production. The production was further improved by deleting genes
encoding malate synthase and the cytosolic form of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The 
engineered S. cerevisiae strain produced up to about 1 g l(-1) of glycolic acid
in a medium containing d-xylose and ethanol. Similar modifications in K. lactis
resulted in a much higher glycolic acid titer. In a bioreactor cultivation with
D-xylose and ethanol up to 15 g l(-1) of glycolic acid was obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of engineering yeast to produce
glycolic acid. Prior to this work glycolic acid production through the glyoxylate
cycle has only been reported in bacteria. The benefit of a yeast host is the
possibility for glycolic acid production also at low pH, which was demonstrated
in flask cultivations. Production of glycolic acid was first shown in S.
cerevisiae. To test whether a Crabtree negative yeast would be better suited for 
glycolic acid production we engineered K. lactis in the same way and demonstrated
it to be a better host for glycolic acid production.
