Long term residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soils are of great
concerning because they seriously threaten food security and human health. This
article focuses on isolation of OCP-degrading strains and their performance in
bioremediation of contaminated soil under ex situ conditions. A bacterium,
Chryseobacterium sp. PYR2, capable of degrading various OCPs and utilizing them
as a sole carbon and energy source for growth, was isolated from OCP-contaminated
soil. In culture experiments, PYR2 degraded 80-98% of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
or 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDT) isomers (50 mg L(-1)) in
30 days. A pilot-scale ex situ bioremediation study of highly OCP-contaminated
soil augmented with PYR2 was performed. During the 45-day experimental period,
DDT concentration was reduced by 80.3% in PYR2-augmented soils (35.37 mg kg(-1)
to 6.97 mg kg(-1)) but by only 57.6% in control soils. Seven DDT degradation
intermediates (metabolites) were detected and identified in PYR2-augmented soils:
five by GC/MS: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD),
1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE), 1-chloro-2,2-bis
(4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU), 1-chloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethane
(DDMS), and dichlorobenzophenone (DBP); and two by LC/MS: 4-chlorobenzoic acid
(PCBA) and 4-chlorophenylacetic acid (PCPA). Levels of metabolites were fairly
stable in control soils but varied greatly with time in PYR2-augmented soils.
Levels of DDD, DDMU, and DDE in PYR2-augmented soils increased from day 0 to day 
30 and then decreased by day 45. A DDT biodegradation pathway is proposed based
on our identification of DDT metabolites in PYR2-augmented systems. PYR2 will be 
useful in future studies of OCP biodegradation and in bioremediation of
OCP-contaminated soils.
