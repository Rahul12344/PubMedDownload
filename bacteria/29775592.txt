Genome-wide association studies have identified risk loci associated with the
development of inflammatory bowel disease, while epidemiological studies have
emphasized that pathogenesis likely involves host interactions with environmental
elements whose source and structure need to be defined. Here, we identify a class
of compounds derived from dietary, microbial, and industrial sources that are
characterized by the presence of a five-membered oxazole ring and induce
CD1d-dependent intestinal inflammation. We observe that minimal oxazole
structures modulate natural killer T cell-dependent inflammation by regulating
lipid antigen presentation by CD1d on intestinal epithelial cells (IECs).
CD1d-restricted production of interleukin 10 by IECs is limited through activity 
of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway in response to oxazole induction
of tryptophan metabolites. As such, the depletion of the AhR in the intestinal
epithelium abrogates oxazole-induced inflammation. In summary, we identify
environmentally derived oxazoles as triggers of CD1d-dependent intestinal
inflammatory responses that occur via activation of the AhR in the intestinal
epithelium.
