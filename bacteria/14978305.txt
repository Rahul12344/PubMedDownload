A rapid unidirectional method for cloning PCR-amplified cDNA fragments into
virtually any fusion protein expression vector is described. The method, termed
PRESAT-vector cloning, is based on a T-vector technique that does not require
restriction endonuclease digestion of the PCR product. Subsequently, we applied a
novel ORF selection method of the ligated plasmid products. This second step
involves restriction endonuclease treatment that eliminates the plasmids
containing an ORF in the wrong orientation prior to transformation into the
bacterial host for further protein expression studies. To achieve this selection,
we customized the 5'-sequence of the "rear" PCR primer corresponding to the C
terminus of the protein to be expressed. The colonies harbored only the ligated
products of the desired orientation at >90% efficiency. This method is applied to
a GST fusion expression system, and an HTS system for soluble proteins from an
expression library was tested.
