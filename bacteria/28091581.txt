Utilization of small molecules in modulation of stem cell self-renewal is a
promising approach to expand stem cells for regenerative therapy. Here, we
identify Icaritin, a phytoestrogen molecule enhances self-renewal of mouse
embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Icaritin increases mESCs proliferation while
maintains their self-renewal capacity in vitro and pluripotency in vivo. This
coincides with upregulation of key pluripotency transcription factors OCT4,
NANOG, KLF4 and SOX2. The enhancement of mESCs self-renewal is characterized by
increased population in S-phase of cell cycle, elevation of Cylin E and
Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and downregulation of p21, p27 and p57. PCR
array screening reveals that caudal-related homeobox 2 (Cdx2) and Rbl2/p130 are
remarkably suppressed in mESCs treated with Icaritin. siRNA knockdown of Cdx2 or 
Rbl2/p130 upregulates the expression of Cyclin E, OCT4 and SOX2, and subsequently
increases cell proliferation and colony forming efficiency of mESCs. We then
demonstrate that Icaritin co-localizes with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and
activates its nuclear translocation in mESCs. The promotive effect of Icaritin on
cell cycle and pluripotency regulators are eliminated by siRNA knockdown of ERα
in mESCs. The results suggest that Icaritin enhances mESCs self-renewal by
regulating cell cycle machinery and core pluripotency transcription factors
mediated by ERα.
