BACKGROUND: Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by 
Micromonospora purpurea bacteria, effective against Gram-negative bacterial
infections. Major fractions of the gentamicin complex (C1, C1a, C2, C2a) possess 
weak antifungal activity and one of the minor components (A, A1-A4, B, B1, X),
gentamicin B1 was found to be a strong antifungal agent.
METHODS: This work uses in vitro and in vivo dilution methods to compare the
antifusarial, antiaspergillic and anticryptococcal effects of gentamicin
derivatives and structurally-related congeners.
RESULTS: The in vitro antifusarial activity of gentamicin B1 (minimum inhibitory 
concentration (MIC) 0.4 μg/mL) and structurally-related compounds (MIC 0.8-12.5
μg/mL) suggests that the purpuroseamine ring substituents are responsible for the
specific antimycotic effect. The functional groups of the garoseamine and
2-deoxystreptamine rings of gentamicin derivatives are identical in gentamicin
compounds and are unlikely to exert a significant antifungal effect. Among soil
dermatophytes, Microsporum gypseum was more susceptible to gentamicin B1 (MIC 3.1
µg/mL) than Trichophyton gypseum (MIC 25 µg/mL). The in vitro antifungal effect
of gentamicin B1 against plant pathogenic fungi was comparable to primary
antifungal agents.
CONCLUSION: Gentamicin is already in medical use. In vitro and preclinical in
vivo synergisms of gentamicin B1 with amphotericin B suggest immediate clinical
trials starting with subtoxic doses.
