Stimulation of several human and murine hematopoietically derived cell lines with
anti-Fas antibodies induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a panel of
proteins observed in whole-cell lysates. In the human T cell line Jurkat, the
activity of a 56-kDa tyrosine kinase was likewise activated by anti-Fas
antibodies. Immunoprecipitation studies of anti-Fas-stimulated human Jurkat and
murine 2B4.11 T cells revealed activation of the Src-family tyrosine kinases Lck 
and Fyn. Fas receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 c-cbl
proto-oncogene product was observed in Jurkat T cells. Pharmacological
experiments demonstrated that pretreatment of Jurkat cells with tyrphostins
inhibited Fas-induced apoptosis; likewise, Lck activity was inhibited by
tyrphostins in a dose-dependent fashion. Finally, Lck derived from unstimulated
Jurkat T cells formed stable complexes with the intracellular domain of the Fas
receptor. These data are consistent with the notion that expression and
activation of members of the Src-family kinases is required for Fas-induced cell 
death in T lymphocytes and consistent with recent findings demonstrating
decreased Fas-mediated thymocytic death in Fyn-knockout mice.
