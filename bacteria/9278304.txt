CD28 is a 44-kDa homodimeric receptor that is expressed on the majority of T
cells. Engagement of the CD28 receptor by soluble anti-CD28 mAb in conjunction
with phorbol ester (PMA) induces the production of cytokines and the
proliferation of resting T cells via signal transduction pathways independent of 
the TCR. Evidence is provided herein that CD28 signals leading to cytokine
production do not require the p59fyn (Fyn) tyrosine kinase, whereas CD28-mediated
proliferation is dependent on the presence of the Fyn kinase in thymic, but not
lymph node, cells. The defect in proliferation is not due to failure of IL-2R
signaling, since addition of high concentrations of exogenous IL-2 can overcome
the proliferative defect. Analysis of CD28-directed induction of the IL-2R alpha 
(CD25)-chain, which confers high affinity binding to IL-2, showed that
Fyn-deficient thymocytes, but not lymph node cells, failed to up-regulate CD25
expression following anti-CD28 and PMA stimulation. Thus, the Fyn tyrosine kinase
is critically required for thymic CD28-mediated CD25 expression and proliferation
but not for CD28-mediated cytokine production.
