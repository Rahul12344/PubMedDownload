Tuberculosis of tendon sheaths of the hand was rare before the advent of
antituberculous drugs. It seems now-a-days exceptional, for the published series 
become more an more uncommon and smaller. Therefore, the diagnosis is often an
operative surprise on a patient with a painless, gradually developing
tenosynovitis. No patient suffered from other active tuberculosis. But two of
them had an old history of tuberculosis (knee and kidney). Analysis of other
cases is inconclusive about the relation ship between trauma and tuberculosis.
Histology and cultures establish the diagnosis. Surgical treatment consists in
large excision of involved tissues. The damages provoked by the illness are often
important, with sometimes tendon ruptures. However, functional results are
surprisingly not so bad. Antituberculous drugs are the backbone of the surgical
treatment for several months.
