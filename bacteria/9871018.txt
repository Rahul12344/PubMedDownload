Previous studies demonstrated that Alcaligenes eutrophus A5 transforms
1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) to 4-chlorobenzoate via a
meta-ring fission product. The initial reactions could be catalyzed by either
monooxygenase or dioxygenase enzymes. In the present study, a transient
intermediate that accumulated during the transformation of DDT by the
biphenyl-grown cells was identified as
1,1,1-trichloro-2-(4-chlorophenyl-2,3-dihydro-4,6-cyclohexadiene)-2-(4'-
chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT-2,3-dihydrodiol) on the basis of mass spectral analysis 
after n-butylboronic acid derivatization. The dihydrodiol undergoes a
characteristic acid-catalyzed dehydration to produce phenols. 1H-NMR indicated a 
cis-relative stereochemistry. The results indicate that the biphenyl dioxygenase 
from A. eutrophus A5 catalyzes the dihydroxylation of DDT at the unsubstituted
carbons on the aromatic ring to produce DDT-2,3-dihydrodiol.
