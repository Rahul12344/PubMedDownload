Timeless was originally identified in Drosophila as an essential component of
circadian cycle regulation, where its function is tightly controlled at the
protein level by tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation. In mammals,
Timeless has also been implicated in circadian rhythms as well as cell cycle
control and embryonic development. Here we report that mammalian Timeless is an
SH3 domain-binding protein and substrate for several members of the Src
protein-tyrosine kinase family, including Fyn, Hck, c-Src and c-Yes.
Co-expression of Tim with Fyn or Hck was followed by ubiquitylation and
subsequent degradation in human 293T cells. While c-Src and c-Yes also promoted
Tim ubiquitylation, in this case ubiquitylation correlated with Tim protein
accumulation rather than degradation. Both c-Src and c-Yes selectively promoted
modification of Tim through Lys63-linked polyubiquitin, which may explain the
differential effects on Tim protein turnover. These data show distinct and
opposing roles for individual Src-family members in the regulation of Tim protein
levels, suggesting a unique mechanism for the regulation of Tim function in
mammals.
