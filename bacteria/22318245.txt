BACKGROUND: The optimal enzyme blend that maximizes human islet yield for
transplantation remains to be determined. In this study, we evaluated eight
different enzyme combinations (ECs) in an attempt to improve islet yield. The ECs
consisted of purified, intact or truncated class 1 (C1) and class 2 (C2)
collagenases from Clostridium histolyticum (Ch), and neutral protease (NP) from
Bacillus thermoproteolyticus rokko (thermolysin) or Ch (ChNP).
METHODS: We report the results of 249 human islet isolations, including 99
deceased donors (research n=57, clinical n=42) and 150 chronic pancreatitis
pancreases. We prepared a new enzyme mixture (NEM) composed of intact C1 and C2
collagenases and ChNP in place of thermolysin. The NEM was first tested in split 
pancreas (n=5) experiments and then used for islet autologous (n=21) and
allogeneic transplantation (n=10). Islet isolation outcomes from eight different 
ECs were statistically compared using multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: The NEM consistently achieved higher islet yields from pancreatitis
(P<0.003) and deceased donor pancreases (P<0.001) than other standard ECs. Using 
the NEM, islet products met release criteria for transplantation from 8 of 10
consecutive pancreases, averaging 6510 ± 2150 islet equivalent number/gram
(IEQ/g) pancreas and 694,681 ± 147,356 total IEQ/transplantation. In autologous
isolation, the NEM yielded more than 200,000 IEQ from 19 of 21 pancreases
(averaging 422,893 ± 181,329 total IEQ and 5979 ± 1469 IEQ/kg recipient body
weight) regardless of the severity of fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: A NEM composed of ChNP with CIzyme high intact C1 collagenase
recovers higher islet yield from deceased and pancreatitis pancreases while
retaining islet quality and function.
