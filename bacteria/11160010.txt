Lung dendritic cells were identified by immunohistochemistry in lung tissue
sections from C57BL/6 mice. Following isolation from the lungs using CD11c
magnetic beads, the flow cytometric analysis of I-A(b+) and CD11c(+) cells
indicated a mixed population of dendritic cells at different stages of
maturation, with most expressing an immature phenotype. When cultured for 7 days 
with recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 99% of 
cells were CD11c(+) and had a morphology typical of immature dendritic cells.
These cells were negative for CD34, CD14, and CD8 alpha antigens but expressed
low levels of the myeloid marker F4/80 and moderate levels of MAC3. All expressed
high levels of CD11a (LFA-1), CD11b (Mac1), and CD54 antigens, with low levels of
class II major histocompatibility complex. Most cells expressed CD80 but only a
small percentage of cells were positive for CD40 and CD86. Both overnight and
7-day cultures of lung dendritic cells were able to phagocytose Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and this was associated with the production of interleukin-12 and
stimulation of both na√Øve and immune T cells to produce gamma interferon.
