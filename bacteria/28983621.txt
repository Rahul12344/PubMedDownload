Ring finger protein 8 (RNF8), an FHA/RING domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, 
is critical in supporting genome integrity by facilitating the assembly of
multiple DNA repair proteins at DNA lesions following DNA damage. In the present 
study, a search for novel binding partners of RNF8 was performed using a yeast
two‑hybrid screening assay, and small ubiquitin‑like modifier (SUMO)2/3 was
identified as one of the major RNF8‑binding candidates. GST pull‑down and
immunoprecipitation assays revealed that RNF8 bound directly and noncovalently to
SUMO2/3, but not to SUMO1, and that the FHA domain of RNF8 was required for the
binding to SUMO2/3. Furthermore, RNF8 co‑localized with SUMO2/3 at sites of DNA
lesions in response to ionizing radiation, as revealed by immunofluorescence
assay. Survival assay indicated that the depletion of RNF8 and SUMO2/3 resulted
in decreased cellular resistance to genotoxic stress. These data suggested that
the binding of RNF8 to SUMO2/3 promoted the response to DNA damage.
