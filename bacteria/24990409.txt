CD1d-mediated lipid antigen presentation activates a subset of innate immune
lymphocytes called invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells that, by virtue of
their potent cytokine production, bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems. 
Transforming growth factor (TGF-β) is a known immune modulator that can activate 
the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38; we have previously shown that p38 is a 
negative regulator of CD1d-mediated antigen presentation. Several studies
implicate a role for TGF-β in the activation of p38. Therefore, we hypothesized
that TGF-β would impair antigen presentation by CD1d. Indeed, a dose-dependent
decrease in CD1d-mediated antigen presentation and impairment of lipid antigen
processing was observed in response to TGF-β treatment. However, it was found
that this inhibition was not through p38 activation. Instead, Smads 2, 3 and 4,
downstream elements of the TGF-β canonical signalling pathway, contributed to the
observed effects. In marked contrast to that observed with CD1d, TGF-β was found 
to enhance MHC class II-mediated antigen presentation. Overall, these results
suggest that the canonical TGF-β/Smad pathway negatively regulates an important
arm of the host's innate immune responses - CD1d-mediated lipid antigen
presentation to NKT cells.
