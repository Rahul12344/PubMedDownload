Due to rapid advances in the era of electronic technologies, indium has played
the important material for the production of liquid crystal display screens in
the semiconductor and optoelectronic industries. The present study focuses on
evaluating the toxic effects and related mechanisms of indium chloride (InCl3) on
RAW264.7 macrophages. Cytotoxicity was induced by InCl3 in a concentration- and
time-dependent manner. InCl3 had the ability to induce macrophage death through
apoptosis rather than through necrosis. According to the cytokinesis-block
micronucleus assay and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, InCl3
induced DNA damage, also called genotoxicity, in a concentration-dependent
manner. Cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease (caspase)-3, -8, and -9
were activated by InCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Mitochondria
dysfunction and cytochrome c release from the mitochondria were induced by InCl3 
in a concentration-dependent manner. Downregulation of BCL2 and upregulation of
BAD were induced by InCl3 in a concentration-dependent manner. More, we proposed 
that InCl3 treatment generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a
concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, the current study revealed that
InCl3 induced macrophage cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and genotoxicity via a
mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway and ROS generation.
