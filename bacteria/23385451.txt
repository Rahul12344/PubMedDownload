Vibrio vulnificus utilizes the type II secretion system (T2SS), culminating in a 
megadalton outer membrane complex called the secretin, to translocate
extracellular proteins from the periplasmic space across the outer membrane. In
Aeromonas hydrophila, the general secretion pathway proteins ExeA and ExeB form
an inner membrane complex which interacts with peptidoglycan and is required for 
the assembly of the secretin composed of ExeD. In V. vulnificus, these two
proteins are fused into one protein, EpsAB. Here, the crystal structure of a
periplasmic domain of EpsAB (amino acids 333-584) solved by SAD phasing is
presented. The crystals belonged to space group C2 and diffracted to 1.55 Å
resolution.
