As activated B cells differentiate into plasma cells they complete a final series
of migration steps that take them to locations where they can efficiently carry
out their effector function, secreting immunoglobulin (Ig) M or IgG into
circulation or releasing dimeric IgA adjacent to the epithelium for transcytosis.
Recent experiments have established a key role for chemokines in directing
antibody secreting cell (ASC) movement within the secondary lymphoid organs where
they are generated, as well as in guiding the cells to the bone marrow or mucosal
surfaces. This review discusses the chemokines involved in directing ASC
movements, particularly focusing on the role of CXCR4 and CXCL12/SDF1. The
function of CCR9 and CCR10 in IgA ASC homing and contributions made by integrins 
and lectins are also discussed.
