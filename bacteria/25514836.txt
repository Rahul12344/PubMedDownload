The biosynthesis of integric acid, a secondary metabolite of the wood-decay
fungus Xylaria feejeensis strain 2FB-PPM08M, has been studied. Labeling
experiments using [1-(13)C], [2-(13)C] and [1,2-(13)C2] acetate and L-methionine 
(methyl-(13)C) were separately performed with fungal culture. The labeling
patterns of these metabolites indicated the same origin, and determined that
integric acid was formed through the condensation of a sesquiterpene and a
polyketide. These experiments showed that side chain of compounds would be
synthesized by the polyketide pathway, while the ring carbon indicated the
biosynthesis of compounds via the mevalonate pathway.
