BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the long-acting granulocyte-colony stimulating
factors (G-CSFs) pegfilgrastim (PEG) and lipegfilgrastim (LIPEG) compared with
filgrastim (FIL) regarding the mobilization efficiency of CD34+ cells, graft
cellular composition, and engraftment.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this prospective nonrandomized study, 36 patients
with non-Hodgkin lymphoma received FIL, 67 received PEG, and 16 patients received
LIPEG as a cytokine after chemotherapy. We analyzed the mobilization and
collection of CD34+ cells, cellular composition of blood grafts, and hematologic 
recovery after auto-SCT according to the type of G-CSF used.
RESULTS: Patients in the LIPEG group had fewer apheresis sessions (1 vs. 2, p =
0.021 for FIL and p = 0.111 for PEG) as well as higher median blood CD34+ cell
counts at the start of the first apheresis (LIPEG 74 × 106 /L vs. FIL 31 × 106
/L, p = 0.084 or PEG 27 × 106 /L, p = 0.021) and CD34+ yields of the first
apheresis (FIL 5.1 × 106 /kg vs. FIL 2.3 × 106 /kg, p = 0.105 or PEG 1.8 × 106
/kg, p = 0.012). Also, the costs associated with G-CSF mobilization and apheresis
were lower in the LIPEG group. The graft composition was comparable except for
the higher infused CD34+ cell counts in the LIPEG group. The engraftment kinetics
were significantly slower in the FIL group.
CONCLUSION: LIPEG appears to be more efficient compared with PEG after
chemotherapy to mobilize CD34+ cells for auto-SCT demonstrated as fewer sessions 
of aphereses needed as well as 2.8-fold CD34+ cell yields on the first apheresis 
day. Early hematologic recovery was more rapid in the LIPEG group. Thus further
studies on LIPEG in the mobilization setting are warranted.
