Follicular thyroid adenoma (FTA) precedes follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) by
definition with a favorable prognosis compared to FTC. However, the genetic
mechanism of FTA to FTC progression remains unknown. For this, it is required to 
disclose FTA and FTC genomes in mutational and evolutionary perspectives. We
performed whole-exome sequencing and copy number profiling of 14 FTAs and 13
FTCs, which exhibited previously-known gene mutations (NRAS, HRAS, BRAF, TSHR and
EIF1AX) and copy number alterations (CNAs) (22q loss and 1q gain) in follicular
tumors. In addition, we found eleven potential cancer-related genes with
mutations (EZH1, SPOP, NF1, TCF12, IGF2BP3, KMT2C, CNOT1, BRIP1, KDM5C, STAG2 and
MAP4K3) that have not been reported in thyroid follicular tumors. Of note, FTA
genomes showed comparable levels of mutations to FTC in terms of the number,
sequence composition and functional consequences (potential driver mutations) of 
mutations. Analyses of evolutionary ages using somatic mutations as molecular
clocks further identified that FTA genomes were as old as FTC genomes.
Whole-transcriptome sequencing did not find any gene fusions with potential
significance. Our data indicate that FTA genomes may be as old as FTC genomes,
thus suggesting that follicular thyroid tumor genomes during the transition from 
FTA to FTC may stand stable at genomic levels in contrast to the discernable
changes at pathologic and clinical levels. Also, the data suggest a possibility
that the mutational profiles obtained from early biopsies may be useful for the
molecular diagnosis and therapeutics of follicular tumor patients.
