Chemokines are secreted proteins that direct the migration of immune cells and
are involved in numerous disease states. For example, CCL21 (CC chemokine ligand 
21) and CCL19 (CC chemokine ligand 19) recruit antigen-presenting dendritic cells
and naïve T-cells to the lymph nodes and are thought to play a role in lymph node
metastasis of CCR7 (CC chemokine receptor 7)-expressing cancer cells. For many
chemokine receptors, N-terminal posttranslational modifications, particularly the
sulfation of tyrosine residues, increases the affinity for chemokine ligands and 
may contribute to receptor ligand bias. Chemokine sulfotyrosine (sY) binding
sites are also potential targets for drug development. In light of the structural
similarity between sulfotyrosine and phosphotyrosine (pY), the interactions of
CCL21 with peptide fragments of CCR7 containing tyrosine, pY, or sY were compared
using protein NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy in this study.
Various N-terminal CCR7 peptides maintain binding site specificity with Y8-,
pY8-, or sY8-containing peptides binding near the α-helix, while Y17-, pY17-, and
sY17-containing peptides bind near the N-loop and β3-stand of CCL21. All modified
CCR7 peptides showed enhanced binding affinity to CCL21, with sY having the
largest effect.
