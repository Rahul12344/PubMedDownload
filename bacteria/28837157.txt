PurposeMutations in genes involved in Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA DNA repair pathway
cause cancer susceptibility diseases including familial breast cancer and Fanconi
anemia (FA). A single FA patient with biallelic FANCM mutations was reported in
2005 but concurrent FANCA pathogenic mutations precluded assignment of FANCM as
an FA gene. Here we report three individuals with biallelic FANCM truncating
mutations who developed early-onset cancer and toxicity to chemotherapy but did
not present congenital malformations or any hematological phenotype suggestive of
FA.MethodsChromosomal breakages, interstrand crosslink sensitivity, and FANCD2
monoubiquitination were assessed in primary fibroblasts. Mutation analysis was
achieved through Sanger sequencing. Genetic complementation of patient-derived
cells was performed by lentiviral mediated transduction of wild-type FANCM
complementary DNA followed by functional studies.ResultsPatient-derived cells
exhibited chromosomal fragility, hypersensitivity to interstrand crosslinks, and 
impaired FANCD2 monoubiquitination. We identified two homozygous mutations
(c.2586_2589del4; p.Lys863Ilefs*12 and c.1506_1507insTA; p.Ile503*) in FANCM as
the cause of the cellular phenotype. Patient-derived cells were genetically
complemented upon wild-type FANCM complementary DNA
expression.ConclusionLoss-of-function mutations in FANCM cause a cancer
predisposition syndrome clinically distinct from bona fide FA. Care should be
taken with chemotherapy and radiation treatments in these patients due to
expected acute toxicity.
