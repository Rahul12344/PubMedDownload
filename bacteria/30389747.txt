Senescent T cells have been implicated in chronic inflammatory and cardiovascular
diseases. In this study, we explored the relationship between senescent T cells
and glycemic status in a cohort of 805 participants by investigating the
frequency of CD57+ or CD28null senescent T cells in peripheral blood.
Participants with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) with follow-up data (N = 149)
were included to determine whether hyperglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes)
developed during follow-up (mean 2.3 years). CD8+CD57+ and CD8+CD28null T-cell
frequencies were significantly higher in prediabetes and type 2 diabetes compared
with NGT. Increased CD57+ or CD28null cells in the CD8+ T-cell subset were
independently associated with hyperglycemia. Furthermore, among participants with
baseline NGT, the frequency of CD8+CD57+ T cells was an independent predictor of 
hyperglycemia development. Immunofluorescent analyses confirmed that CD8+CD57+
T-cell infiltration was increased in visceral adipose tissue of patients with
prediabetes or type 2 diabetes compared with those with NGT. Our data suggest
that increased frequency of senescent CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood is
associated with development of hyperglycemia.
