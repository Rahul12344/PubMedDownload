[Local and systemic antimycotic therapy of Candida-induced denture stomatitis].

[Article in German]

Haessler D.

15 patients with clinically outstanding prosthesis stomatitis due to
microscopically proved candida infection underwent treatment with the antimycotic
agent Clotrimazol. After two weeks' therapy improvement was observed in 6
patients (40%), healing in 4 patients (27%); 4 patients did not respond and in
one patient the condition was temporally made worse. Examination two weeks after 
cessation of therapy showed that the clinical condition in 8 patients was as bad 
as before therapy (53%), and 4 patients (27%) were symptom-free. 3 patients (20%)
had improved further. Suggestions for the treatment of prosthesis stomatitis can 
be derived from these findings.
