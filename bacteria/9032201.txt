Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most frequent cause of community-acquired
pneumonia. We sought to determine the role of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)
in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia. Induction of pneumonia in C57B1/6 
mice by intranasal inoculation with 10(6) colony-forming units (cfu) S.
pneumoniae resulted in a sustained increase in TNF activity in lung homogenates
reaching a plateau between 12 and 72 h (72 h: 185.49 +/- 54.41 ng/g), while
plasma TNF activity remained low or undetectable. Treatment with a neutralizing
anti-TNF monoclonal antibody 2 h before inoculation strongly reduced lung TNF
activity, but only modestly diminished lung interleukin (IL)-1beta levels, and
did not significantly influence lung IL-6, IL-10, and interferon-gamma
concentrations. Anti-TNF-treated mice had fourfold more S. pneumoniae cfu
isolated from lungs than control mice 40 h after inoculation (p < 0.05), although
lung myeloperoxidase activities were similar in both treatment groups.
Anti-TNF-treated mice died significantly earlier from pneumococcal pneumonia than
control mice (p < 0.05). Endogenously produced TNF is important for host defense 
during pneumococcal pneumonia.
