The effect of a complex of organochlorine compounds on the phagocytic activity of
macrophages and neutrophils in milk was assessed in vitro using a mixture of DDT,
DDE, DDD, alpha, beta and gamma-HCH and HCB and PCBs in concentrations occurring 
in milk and in concentrations being multiples of the concentrations in milk.
Standard strains 305 and Smith of S. aureus were used for phagocytosis
assessment. A suppressing effect of these compounds was observed on the per cent 
of cells phagocytizing both these strains, with a significant decrease in the
number of bacteria of both strains phagocytized by macrophages, and the number of
S. aureus strain 305 bacteria phagocytized by neutrophils. The concentrations of 
the mixture of organochlorine compounds used in the experiment had no significant
effect on the number of Smith strain bacteria phagocytized by neutrophils.
