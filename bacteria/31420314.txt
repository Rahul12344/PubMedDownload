BACKGROUND: According to extrapolations, around 35,000 patients in Germany
develop hospital acquired infections (HAI) with a multidrug-resistant organism
(MDRO) every year, and about 1500 of them die. Previous estimations were based on
laboratory data and prevalence studies. Aim of this study was to establish the
incidences of hospital acquired MDRO infections and the resulting deaths by
expert review.
METHODS: Data on patients suffering from a hospital acquired MDRO infection were 
collected from 32 hospitals from all care levels. Records of patients with MDRO
infection who died in the year 2016 underwent an onsite review by two experts to 
determine the impact of the infection, if any, on the cause of death.
RESULTS: A total of 714,108 in-patients were treated in 32 hospitals
participating in the study. Of these patients, 1136 suffered a hospital acquired 
MDRO infection (1.59 per 1000 patients). 215 patients with an MDRO infection died
[0.301 per 1000, (95% CI 0,261-0,341)], but only in 78 cases this was estimated
as the cause of death [0.109 per 1000 patients (95% CI 0.085-0.133)].
CONCLUSION: By putting the above rates in relation to the total number of
in-patients in Germany, it can be rated that around 31,052 patients per year
suffer a hospital acquired MDRO infection, and 2132 patients die from it. These
results from our reviewer investigation confirm earlier extrapolations.
