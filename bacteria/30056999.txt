Myeloid-related protein (MRP)8 and MRP14 form a complex (MRP8/14) that is
released by activated neutrophils and monocytes during infection. MRP8/14 has
been shown to have bacteriostatic activity in vitro against Borrelia burgdorferi,
the spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis. Furthermore, levels of MRP8/14 have 
been shown to be elevated in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis. We
hypothesized that MRP8/14 has a protective effect during B. burgdorferi
infection. To determine the role of MRP8/14 in the immune response to B.
burgdorferi, we studied the course of B. burgdorferi infection in wildtype (wt)
and mrp14-/- mice. In addition, we studied the response of leukocytes from mice
lacking MRP8/14 to B. burgdorferi ex vivo. We demonstrated similar levels of B.
burgdorferi dissemination, cytokine and immunoglobulin production in infected wt 
and mrp14-/- mice after 21 days. Neutrophils and monocytes lacking MRP8/14 were
undiminished in their ability to become activated or phagocytose B. burgdorferi. 
In conclusion, we did not find a central role of MRP8/14 in the immune response
against B. burgdorferi. As the levels of MRP8/14 in the serum of infected mice
were low, we speculate that MRP8/14 is not released in levels great enough to
influence the course of B. burgdorferi infection.
