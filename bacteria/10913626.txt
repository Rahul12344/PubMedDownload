The most predominant co-stimulation pathway, which is critical for T cell
activation and proliferation, is the CD28-B7 pathway. The anti-CD28 monoclonal
antibody (mAb) also provides a co-stimulatory signal to T cells. In order to
construct a functional Fv fragment (complex of VH and VL domains) of anti-CD28
antibody using a bacterial expression system, cDNA encoding the variable regions 
of immunoglobulin from 15E8 hybridoma cells was cloned and expressed in
Escherichia coli. The Fv fragment was obtained as a soluble protein from the
periplasmic fraction and showed a binding pattern similar to parental IgG. The Fv
fragment induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the
presence of anti-CD3 or anti-CD2 mAb and enhanced anti-tumor activity of
anti-MUC1x(anti)-CD3 bispecific antibody when tested with lymphokine-activated
killer cells with T cell phenotype. Thus, the anti-CD28 Fv fragment will be
promising not only for the study of co-stimulation, but also for cancer
immunotherapy.
