Two novel Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped and non-motile bacterial strains,
designated B5-SW-15T and C2-DW-16, were isolated from water collected in mangrove
forests in Ranong Province, Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA
gene sequences revealed that strains B5-SW-15T and C2-DW-16 belonged to the genus
Donghicola and were most closely related to Donghicola tyrosinivorans DSM 100212T
(98.2 and 98.1 %, respectively) and Donghicola eburneus DSM 29127T (97.7 and
97.6 %, respectively). The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA
hybridization values between strain B5-SW-15T, strain C2-DW-16 and related
species were 95.8 and 71.6 % (to strain C2-DW-16), 76.8 and 21.3 % (to D.
tyrosinivorans DSM 100212T) and 80.3 and 24.2 % (to D. eburneus DSM 29127T),
respectively. The predominant cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were summed feature 8
(C18 : 1  ω6c and/or C18 : 1  ω7c), C16 : 0 and C12 : 1 3-OH. Ubiquinone Q-10 was
the sole respiratory quinone. DNA G+C contents of the isolates were 61.0 and
61.2 mol% based on whole genome sequences. Strains B5-SW-15T and C2-DW-16
contained aminolipid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and
phosphatidylglycerol as the major polar lipids. On the basis of the results from 
phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic analyses, strains B5-SW-15T and
C2-DW-16 constitute a novel species of the genus Donghicola in the family
Rhodobacteraceae for which the name Donghicola mangrovi sp. nov. is proposed. The
type strain is B5-SW-15T (=BCC 56522T=TBRC 9562T=KCTC 72743T).
