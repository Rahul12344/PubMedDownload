pUDK-HGF, recombinant plasmid DNA encoding human HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), 
is a potential agent for gene therapy of ischaemic disease. Production of
pUDK-HGF is essential for its clinical application. In the present paper, a
large-scale manufacturing process was developed, including fermentation, cell
harvest, alkaline lysis, capturing plasmid DNA with Q-Sepharose XL
chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S1000 column and
refining with Source 15Q anion-exchange chromatography. The quality criteria of
pUDK-HGF such as purity, concentration, homogeneity, residual RNA, chromosomal
DNA, contaminated protein, endotoxin and HGF expression efficacy all were
analysed and met the requirements for pharmaceutical-grade plasmid DNA.
