In this study we demonstrated that Staphylococcus aureus lipoteichoic acid (LTA) 
and protein-A (PA) induce the release from human dermal fibroblasts of hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), a proliferation factor of epithelial cells (including
keratinocytes). In contrast, LPS and porins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not
stimulate HGF production. Recombinant human IL-1 beta induced HGF release. This
production was synergistically enhanced when in association with LTA (by more
than twice) and PA (by about two-thirds). Controls were performed in the presence
of bacterial components alone. In previous studies we have shown that LPS and
porins are inducers of IL-1 alpha and beta and other cytokines from human
monocytes. Therefore it is possible that in inflammatory cutaneous foci and
infected wounds, bacterial components may induce HGF release from dermal human
fibroblasts. LTA and PA act directly, while LPS and porins act indirectly,
through the release of cytokines by monocytes/macrophages. HGF plays an important
role in the repair of cutaneous tissue during gram-positive and gram-negative
infections.
