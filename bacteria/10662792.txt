Initiation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling is dependent on Lck, a Src 
family kinase. The Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP) contains Src homology (SH)3
and SH2 domains, which are highly homologous to those of Lck and other Src family
members. Because of the structural similarity between Lck and SLAP, we studied
its potential role in TCR signaling. Here, we show that SLAP is expressed in T
cells, and that when expressed in Jurkat T cells it can specifically inhibit TCR 
signaling leading to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-, activator
protein 1 (AP-1)-, and interleukin 2-dependent transcription. The SH3 and SH2
domains of SLAP are required for maximal attenuation of TCR signaling. This
inhibitory activity can be bypassed by the combination of phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, suggesting that SLAP acts proximally in the TCR
signaling pathway. SLAP colocalizes with endosomes in Jurkat and in HeLa cells,
and is insoluble in mild detergents. In stimulated Jurkat cells, SLAP associates 
with a molecular signaling complex containing CD3zeta, ZAP-70, SH2
domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76), Vav, and possibly linker
for activation of T cells (LAT). These results suggest that SLAP is a negative
regulator of TCR signaling.
