Neutrophil trafficking is essential for a strong and productive immune response
to infection and injury. During acute inflammation, signals from resident immune 
cells, fibroblasts, and the endothelium help to prime, attract, and activate
circulating neutrophils at sites of inflammation. Due to current limitations with
in vitro and animal models, our understanding of these events is incomplete. In
this paper, we describe a microfluidic technology which incorporates a
lumen-based vascular component with a high degree of spatiotemporal control to
facilitate the study of neutrophil trafficking using primary human cells. The
improved spatiotemporal control allows functional selection of neutrophils based 
on their migratory capacity. We use this technology to investigate
neutrophil-endothelial interactions and find that these interactions are
necessary for robust neutrophil chemotaxis to interleukin-8 (IL-8) and priming of
the neutrophils. In agreement with previous studies, we observed that
transendothelial migration (TEM) is required for neutrophils to enter a primed
phenotypic state. TEM neutrophils not only produce a significantly higher amount 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) when treated with PMA, but also upregulate genes
involved in ROS production (CYBB, NCF1, NFKB1, NFKBIA), cell adhesion (CEACAM-8, 
ITGAM), and chemokine receptors (CXCR2, TNFRSF1A). These results suggest that
neutrophil-endothelial interactions are crucial to neutrophil chemotaxis and ROS 
generation.
