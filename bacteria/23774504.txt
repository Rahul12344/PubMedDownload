Human GDP-l-fucose synthase, also known as FX protein, synthesizes GDP-l-fucose
from its substrate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-mannose. The reaction involves
epimerization at both C-3 and C-5 followed by an NADPH-dependent reduction of the
carbonyl at C-4. In this paper, the first crystal structure of human FX protein
was determined at 2.37 Å resolution. The asymmetric unit of the crystal structure
contains four molecules which form two homodimers. Each molecule consists of two 
domains, a Rossmann-fold NADPH-binding motif and a carboxyl terminal domain.
Compared with the Escherichia coli GDP-l-fucose synthase, the overall structures 
of these two enzymes have four major differences. There are four loops in the
structure of human FX protein corresponding to two α-helices and two β-sheets in 
that of the E. coli enzyme. Besides, there are seven different amino acid
residues binding with NAPDH comparing human FX protein with that from E. coli.
The structure of human FX reveals the key catalytic residues and could be useful 
for the design of drugs for the treatment of inflammation, auto-immune diseases, 
and possibly certain types of cancer.
