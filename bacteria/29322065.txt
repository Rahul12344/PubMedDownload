Investigations of anti-HIV-1 human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell
(HSPC)-based gene therapy have been performed by HIV-1 challenge after the
engraftment of gene-modified HSPCs in humanized mouse models. However, the
clinical application of gene therapy is to treat HIV-1-infected patients. Here,
we developed a new method to investigate an anti-HIV-1 HSPC-based gene therapy in
humanized mice previously infected with HIV-1. First, humanized mice were
infected with HIV-1. When plasma viremia reached >107 copies/mL 3Â weeks after
HIV-1 infection, the mice were myeloablated with busulfan and transplanted with
anti-HIV-1 gene-modified CD34+ HSPCs transduced with a lentiviral vector
expressing two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against CCR5 and HIV-1 long terminal
repeat (LTR), along with human thymus tissue under the kidney capsule. Anti-HIV-1
vector-modified human CD34+ HSPCs successfully repopulated peripheral blood and
lymphoid tissues in HIV-1 previously infected humanized mice. Anti-HIV-1 shRNA
vector-modified CD4+ T lymphocytes showed selective advantage in HIV-1 previously
infected humanized mice. This new method will be useful for investigations of
anti-HIV-1 gene therapy when testing in a more clinically relevant experimental
setting.
