This first report describes the purification and identification of an orange-red 
pigment produced by Achromobacter denitrificans strain SP1 (isolated from sewage 
sludge heavily contaminated with plastics) during its growth in a simple basal
salt medium supplemented with the hazardous di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP)
blended in PVC blood bag (in situ) or free DEHP (ex situ) as carbon source. The
cell-bound pigment was elucidated, characterized at molecular level, and
described as an unusual 25C prodigiosin analog for the first time. At laboratory 
conditions (in flasks), the dry cell mass was 75.2mg/g blood bag, which upon
extraction yielded 7.1mg prodigiosin; at this stage the pH of the medium was
dropped from 7.2 to 3.5. Considering its pharmaceutical importance, taking 10
known prodigiosins as controls, this 25C prodigiosin was subjected to molecular
docking studies, showed comparable and promising binding efficiencies with the
crucial molecular human targets like cycloxygenase-2, ZAP-70 kinase and Jak-3
kinase.
