Immune checkpoints negatively regulate immune cell responses. Programmed cell
death protein 1:programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1:PD-L1) and cytotoxic T
lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4):B7-1 are among the most important immune
checkpoint pathways, and are key targets for immunotherapies that seek to
modulate the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals to lead to
favorable therapeutic outcomes. The current dogma of these two immune checkpoint 
pathways has regarded them as independent with no interactions. However, the
newly characterized PD-L1:B7-1 ligand-ligand cis-interaction and its ability to
bind CTLA-4 and CD28, but not PD-1, suggests that these pathways have significant
crosstalk. Here, we propose that the PD-L1:B7-1 cis-interaction brings novel
mechanistic understanding of these pathways, new insights into mechanisms of
current immunotherapies, and fresh ideas to develop better treatments in a
variety of therapeutic settings.
