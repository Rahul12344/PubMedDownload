To determine the role of endogenous interleukin-18 (IL-18) during peritonitis,
IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18 KO) mice and wild-type mice were intraperitoneally
(i.p.) infected with Escherichia coli, the most common causative agent found in
septic peritonitis. Peritonitis was associated with a bacterial dose-dependent
increase in IL-18 concentrations in peritoneal fluid and plasma. After infection,
IL-18 KO mice had significantly more bacteria in the peritoneal lavage fluid and 
were more susceptible for progression to systemic infection at 6 and 20 h
postinoculation than wild-type mice. The relative inability of IL-18 KO mice to
clear E. coli from the abdominal cavity was not due to an intrinsic defect in the
phagocytosing capacity of their peritoneal macrophages or neutrophils. IL-18 KO
mice displayed an increased neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity, but
these migratory neutrophils were less activate, as reflected by a reduced CD11b
surface expression. These data suggest that endogenous IL-18 plays an important
role in the early antibacterial host response during E. coli-induced peritonitis.
