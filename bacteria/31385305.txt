OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the role of caffeine on fertility
parameters in testicular and epididymal tissues of scopolamine-induced model of
amnesia in rats.
METHODS: Adult male rats were treated with scopolamine with or without caffeine. 
The modulatory effects of caffeine or scopolamine on fertility parameters were
assessed in rats' testicular and epididymal homogenates.
KEY FINDINGS: Scopolamine-induced sperm abnormalities, reduced steroidogenic
enzyme 3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and 17β-Hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) activities and serum testosterone levels in rats'
testicular tissues. Treatment with caffeine increased 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD as well 
as testosterone levels. Caffeine also reversed sperm viability, sperm motility
and sperm count in testicular tissues of scopolamine-treated rats. Furthermore,
scopolamine-induced oxidative damage in rats' epididymal and testicular tissues
via reduction of thiol and non-protein thiol content as well as increase in
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Caffeine
attenuated oxidative stress in testicular and epididymal tissues of rats treated 
with scopolamine via increase in non-protein and protein thiol levels with
concomitant reduction in ROS and MDA levels.
CONCLUSION: This study revealed that caffeine (5 and 25 mg/kg) improved sperm
quality, increased steroidogenic enzyme activities and attenuated oxidative
damage in testis and epididymis of rats treated with scopolamine.
