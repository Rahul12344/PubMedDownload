We assessed changes of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV, CD26) in the
context of leptin or leptin receptor deficiency. C57BL/6 mice, Leptin-deficient
mice (ob/ob mice, B6.V-Lep<ob>) and Leptin-receptor-deficient mice (db/db mice,
B6.Cg-m+/+Lepr) were infected with B. Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and sacrificed three 
days later. DPP IV activity in serum was higher in ob/ob mice and in db/db mice
than in wild-type mice. The expression of DPP IV/CD26 on splenocytes was higher
in ob/ob mice than in wild-type animals, and lower in db/db mice, and decreased
upon stimulation with BCG in ob/ob mice only. Several T cell antigens including
CTLA-4 were expressed aberrantly in ob/ob and in db/db mice. Our observations
provide evidence for a relationship between DPP IV and leptin.
