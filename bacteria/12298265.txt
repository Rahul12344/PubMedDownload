"Crespera" is an infectious disease of coffee plants that affects both the coffee
production and the economy of the coffee producer countries. This disease affects
morphologically the plant: long and narrow leaves with wavy borders and marginal 
necrosis; strong chlorosis results in drying of the leave, and leads to bad
conditions of the plant. The internodes are short, producing the appearance of
multiple sprouts in the axial sprout, the flowers can turn greenish, and the
plant can present branches with severe symptoms, and branches without apparent
symptoms at the same time. As a result, the coffee bean production decreases
strikingly. The aim of this work was to determine the occurrence of the possible 
causative agent in the coffee plants using transmission electron microscopy.
Normal and infected plants were compared looking at the leaves, central vein,
lateral veins and petiole. It was determined that xylematic vessels show the
presence of gram negative bacilliform bacteria (of thick-wavy walls), with
dimensions of 0.3-0.5 micron diameter and 1-4 microns, length. The control plants
did not show bacteria in the xylem.
