What is believed to be the first clinical isolate of Bordetella hinzii in the UK,
from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome, is described. This patient had no
known avian exposure, and the source of the organism remains unknown. It appears 
that the underlying immune deficiency of the patient increased the susceptibility
to opportunistic infection with this organism. Human infection with B. hinzii is 
rare and this species is difficult to differentiate from Bordetella avium by
routine phenotypic methods. Confirmation can be reliably achieved using genotypic
methods, and the greater mutational variation of the ompA gene compared to other 
genes (e.g. 16S rRNA gene) allows unambiguous identification of this and other
non-classical Bordetella species.
