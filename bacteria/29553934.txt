A CRISPR Approach for a Common Inherited Disease: Researchers at Duke University 
Hope Gene Editing Can Eliminate Mutations That Lead to Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy.

Mertz L.

Gene editing and CRISPR (a group of repeated DNA sequences in bacteria) typically
target disease-causing mutated genes by eliminating the bad gene altogether, by
correcting the problem DNA to restore proper gene functioning, or by modifying a 
different gene to compensate for the faulty gene's lost function. One research
group at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, however, is using a different
strategy to fight one of the most common inherited genetic diseases: Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD).
