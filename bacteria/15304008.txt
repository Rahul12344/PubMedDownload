MICA and MICB, as members of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
I-chain-related genes (MIC), encode stress-inducible glycoproteins that act as
activating ligands for NKG2D and gammadelta T-cell receptor-bearing cells. We
here describe the identification of eight novel MICB variants, including a null
allele, which were identified in peripheral blood leukocytes of gastric MALT
lymphoma patients. Only two of the novel alleles are characterized by point
mutations, whereas the other variants display a recombination of known exonic
MICB sequences that may be best explained by intragenic conversions. The novel
MICB null allele is characterized by a Cytosin (C) deletion in a stretch of four 
Cs beginning from nucleotide 135 of exon 2 that leads to a premature stop codon
(TGA) at codon 66.
