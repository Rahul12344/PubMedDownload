The benzodiazepine benzomalvin A/D is a fungally derived specialized metabolite
and inhibitor of the substance P receptor NK1, biosynthesized by a three-gene
nonribosomal peptide synthetase cluster. Here, we utilize fungal artificial
chromosomes with metabolomic scoring (FAC-MS) to perform molecular genetic
pathway dissection and targeted metabolomics analysis to assign the in vivo role 
of each domain in the benzomalvin biosynthetic pathway. The use of FAC-MS
identified the terminal cyclizing condensation domain as BenY-CT and the internal
C-domains as BenZ-C1 and BenZ-C2. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered evidence
suggesting BenY-CT or a yet to be identified protein mediates benzodiazepine
formation, representing the first reported benzodiazepine synthase enzymatic
activity. This work informs understanding of what defines a fungal CT domain and 
shows how the FAC-MS platform can be used as a tool for in vivo analyses of
specialized metabolite biosynthesis and for the discovery and dissection of new
enzyme activities.
