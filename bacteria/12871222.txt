Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a phospholipid with potent, diverse actions, 
which has been implicated as an important mediator in host defence against
several intracellular pathogens. To determine the role of PAF in host defence in 
pulmonary tuberculosis, PAF receptor-deficient (PAFR-/-) and wild-type (PAFR+/+) 
mice were infected intranasally with a virulent strain of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. Mycobacterial outgrowth in lungs and liver did not differ
significantly between PAFR-/- and PAFR+/+ mice at 2 or 6 weeks postinfection.
After 28 weeks, 86% of PAFR-/- mice and 79% of PAFR+/+ mice had died
(non-significant). In addition, both mouse strains were indistinguishable with
respect to histopathology, the recruitment and activation of lymphocytes, and
cytokine concentrations in the lung. These data suggest that PAF is not involved 
in the protective immune response to tuberculosis.
