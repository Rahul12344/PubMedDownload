Background: There are various phenotypic methods for identifying class B and
class A β-lactamase enzymes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The purpose of this study 
was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of different phenotypic methods
with HRMA assay to detect β-lactamase-producing P. aeruginosa strains.
Methods: Eighty-eight of P. aeruginosa isolates were collected from different
specimens. Conventional double-disk test (DDT) and EDTA-imipenem microbiological 
(EIM) were performed to detect ESBL and MBL-producing strains, respectively.
Meanwhile, the Modified Hodge test and Carba-NP test were performed on all
carbapenem-resistant strains. HRMA method and sensitivity and specificity of
primers were determined based on the melt curve temperature range. In all
comparisons, PCR was considered as the gold standard.
Results: Of the 402 isolates collected from different clinical specimens, 88
isolates of P. aeruginosa were identified. However, 43 strains were (48.88%)
ESBL-producing, and 7 strains (7.95%) were MBL-producing. Also, using the
Modified Hodge test and Carba-NP method, 11 (12.5%) and 19 (21.59%) strains were 
carbapenemase-producing, respectively. The results of the HRMA test revealed that
genes coding for bla SHV, bla TEM, bla KPC, bla IMP, bla VIM, and bla GES were
detected in 44.31%, 22.72%, 13.63%, 14.7%, 5.6%, and 2.27% of P. aeruginosa
isolates. Nonetheless, for bla KPC and bla GES genes, sensitivity and specificity
of the Carba-NP test were 90.47%, 94.87%, and 83.36%, 94.80%, respectively.
However, sensitivity and specificity of MHT was 91.66%, 98.70%, and 77.77%,
96.42%, respectively. For bla SHV and bla TEM genes, sensitivity and specificity 
of DDT were 95.55%, 95.55%, and 86%, 83.50%, respectively. However, sensitivity
and specificity of EMI were 77.77%, 97.59%, and 91.66%, 97.43% for bla VIM and
bla IMP, respectively.
Conclusion: The HRMA is a powerful, accurate, closed-tube, rapid method for
detecting β-lactamase genes in P. aeruginosa. The high sensitivity and
specificity of this method, along with phenotypic tests, play a useful role in
increasing the predictive value of clinical reports.
