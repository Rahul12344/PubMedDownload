Dystonia is a brain disorder causing involuntary, often painful movements. Apart 
from a role for dopamine deficiency in some forms, the cellular mechanisms
underlying most dystonias are currently unknown. Here, we discover a role for
deficient eIF2α signaling in DYT1 dystonia, a rare inherited generalized form,
through a genome-wide RNAi screen. Subsequent experiments including
patient-derived cells and a mouse model support both a pathogenic role and
therapeutic potential for eIF2α pathway perturbations. We further find genetic
and functional evidence supporting similar pathway impairment in patients with
sporadic cervical dystonia, due to rare coding variation in the eIF2α effector
ATF4. Considering also that another dystonia, DYT16, involves a gene upstream of 
the eIF2α pathway, these results mechanistically link multiple forms of dystonia 
and put forth a new overall cellular mechanism for dystonia pathogenesis,
impairment of eIF2α signaling, a pathway known for its roles in cellular stress
responses and synaptic plasticity.
