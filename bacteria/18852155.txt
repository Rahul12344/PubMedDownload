BACKGROUND: Smoking increases the susceptibility to pulmonary infection and is a 
risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
It is postulated that cigarette smoke suppresses the activation of the innate
immune system in response to bacterial infection.
METHODS: Using sensitive ex vivo analysis, the level of the endogenous antibiotic
peptide human beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) was measured in pharyngeal washing fluid
and sputum from patients with community acquired pneumonia. The regulation of
antibacterial host defence molecules was studied in vitro. The effect of
cigarette smoke on the antibacterial activity of differentiated airway epithelium
and the expression of host defence molecules was studied in an in vitro infection
model.
RESULTS: Current or former smoking was associated with significantly reduced
hBD-2 levels in pharyngeal washing fluid and sputum from patients with acute
pneumonia. Exposure of airway epithelium to smoke in vitro inhibited the
induction of hBD-2 by bacteria. This correlated with decreased antimicrobial
activity. This effect was mimicked by hydrogen peroxide, and catalase blunted the
smoke-induced inhibition of epithelial host defence.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoke exposure suppresses the induction of epithelial antibacterial 
host defences. These findings link smoking with increased susceptibility to
infection. This mechanism may be important in the pathogenesis of pneumonia and
COPD.
