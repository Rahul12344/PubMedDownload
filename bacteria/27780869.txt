URI (unconventional prefoldin RPB5 interactor protein) is an unconventional
prefoldin, RNA polymerase II interactor that functions as a transcriptional
repressor and is part of a larger nuclear protein complex. The components of this
complex and the mechanism of transcriptional repression have not been
characterized. Here we show that KAP1 (KRAB-associated protein 1) and the protein
phosphatase PP2A interact with URI. Mechanistically, we show that KAP1
phosphorylation is decreased following recruitment of PP2A by URI. We
functionally characterize the novel URI-KAP1-PP2A complex, demonstrating a role
of URI in retrotransposon repression, a key function previously demonstrated for 
the KAP1-SETDB1 complex. Microarray analysis of annotated transposons revealed a 
selective increase in the transcription of LINE-1 and L1PA2 retroelements upon
knockdown of URI. These data unveil a new nuclear function of URI and identify a 
novel post-transcriptional regulation of KAP1 protein that may have important
implications in reactivation of transposable elements in prostate cancer cells.
