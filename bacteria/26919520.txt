Exopolyphosphatase (PPX) enzymes degrade inorganic polyphosphate (poly-P), which 
is essential for the survival of microbial cells in response to external
stresses. In this study, a putative exopolyphosphatase from Zymomonas mobilis
(ZmPPX) was crystallized. Crystals of the wild-type enzyme diffracted to 3.3 Å
resolution and could not be optimized further. The truncation of 29 amino acids
from the N-terminus resulted in crystals that diffracted to 1.8 Å resolution. The
crystals belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 122.0, b =
47.1, c = 89.5 Å, α = γ = 90, β = 124.5°. An active-site mutant that crystallized
in the same space group and with similar unit-cell parameters diffracted to 1.56 
Å resolution. One molecule was identified per asymmetric unit. Analytical
ultracentrifugation confirmed that ZmPPX forms a dimer in solution. It was
confirmed that ZmPPX possesses exopolyphosphatase activity against a synthetic
poly-P substrate.
