Defensins and other antimicrobial peptides act in the innate host defense of
epithelial surfaces. Human beta defensin 1 (hBD-1) has recently been shown to be 
expressed in airway epithelial cells and so has been implicated as a primary
component of antibacterial activity in human lung. We attempted to purify these
molecules from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Extraction of BALF on SepPak 
C-18 cartridges, followed by continuous acid-urea polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography yielded 
one fraction with antibacterial activity associated with factors of < 6.5 kD.
N-terminal amino acid sequencing identified these peptides as human neutrophil
defensins (HD) 1 through 3. No hBD-1 was detected. Together with lysozyme, it
appears that HD-1 through -3 are the most prominent antimicrobial factors in
BALF. The contribution of epithelial defensins such as hBD-1 to antibacterial
defense of human airway in vivo remains to be elucidated.
