Kodamaea ohmeri, also known as Pichia ohmeri, is a yeast belonging to the
Saccharomycetes family. In 2012, our hospital has recorded the first case of
fungemia caused by K. ohmeri in an 80-year-old male, admitted to intensive care
following an acute anterior-lateral myocardial infarction. K. ohmeri grew in
blood cultures. Biochemical identification was confirmed using Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry and
molecular sequencing. Antifungal susceptibility has been performed by broth
dilution technique. This case confirms that K. ohmeri is an emergent pathogen
even though rarely isolated in human disease. Permanent catheterization is a risk
factor and may cause the persistence of a K. ohmeri infection, as well as support
treatments (mechanical ventilation, tracheotomy, dialysis). Our therapeutic
strategy has been empirical and based exclusively on tested antifungals MIC
because EUCAST recommendations does not indicate breakpoints.
