A haloalkaline anaerobic microbial community obtained from soda lake sediments
was used to inoculate anaerobic reactors for the production of methane rich
biogas. The microalga Spirulina was successfully digested by the haloalkaline
microbial consortium at alkaline conditions (pH 10, 2.0 M Na(+)). Continuous
biogas production was observed and the obtained biogas was rich in methane, up to
96%. Alkaline medium acted as a CO2 scrubber which resulted in low amounts of CO2
and no traces of H2S in the produced biogas. A hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 
15 days and 0.25 g Spirulina L(-1) day(-1) organic loading rate (OLR) were
identified as the optimal operational parameters. Metagenomic and
metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the hydrolysis of the supplied substrate 
was mainly carried out by Bacteroidetes of the "ML635J-40 aquatic group" while
the hydrogenotrophic pathway was the main producer of methane in a methanogenic
community dominated by Methanocalculus.
