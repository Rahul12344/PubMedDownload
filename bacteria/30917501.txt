An environmentally friendly technique was used to produce levan-capped silver
nanoparticles of about 30 nm (with a loading of 30%) that showed bactericide
effect, for E. coli and B. subtilis. That effect was mathematically studied with 
a dose-response model (lethal dose of 12.4 ppm and 6.8 ppm respectively). These
silver nanoparticles were subsequently introduced in a gel to create a silver
release system with bacteria inhibition activity. Silver release from the gel and
its bactericidal activity was theoretically studied to develop a unique model
that is able to predict accurately both silver release and lethal dose for any
type of bacteria. This model will be useful for performing predictions for future
silver in gel applications.
