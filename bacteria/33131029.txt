In the present study, bacterial isolates were screened for arsenic resistance
efficiency. Environmental isolates were isolated from arsenic-rich soil samples
(i.e., from Rajnandgaon district of Chhattisgarh state, India). Amplification and
sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that the isolates were of Bacillus firmus
RSN1, Brevibacterium senegalense RSN2, Enterobacter cloacae RSN3,
Stenotrophomonas pavanii RSN6, Achromobacter mucicolens RSN7, and Ochrobactrum
intermedium RSN10. Arsenite efflux gene (arsB) was successfully amplified in E.
cloacae RSN3. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis showed an absorption 
of 32.22% arsenic by the RSN3 strain. Furthermore, results of scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) for morphological variations revealed an initial increase in the
cell size at 1 mM sodium arsenate; however, it was decreased at 10 mM
concentration in comparison to control. This change of the cell size in different
metal concentrations was due to the uptake and expulsion of the metal from the
cell, which also confirmed the arsenite efflux system.
