In recent years polyurethane microstructures (PM) have gained increasing
attention in the pharmaceutical field due to the importance of their practical
application. Since finding that such a formulation with genistein could improve
its applications, we have conducted a preliminary study regarding the in vitro
antiproliferative (MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D) and antimicrobial (Staphylococcus
aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis (D),
Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, and Candida albicans) activity in order to test
whether polyurethane micro structuresre present a good option for further
modulation of genistein's bioavailability. It was concluded that the polyurethane
micro structures are a bad in vitro partner for the isoflavone genistein.
