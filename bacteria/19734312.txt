More than 80 small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) and 60 proteins of 16 to 50 amino
acids (small proteins) are encoded in the Escherichia coli genome. The vast
majority of the corresponding genes have no known function. We screened 125 DNA
bar-coded mutants to identify novel cell envelope stress and acute acid shock
phenotypes associated with deletions of genes coding for sRNAs and small
proteins. Nine deletion mutants (ssrA, micA, ybaM, ryeF, yqcG, sroH, ybhT, yobF, 
and glmY) were sensitive to cell envelope stress and two were resistant (rybB and
blr). Deletion mutants of genes coding for four small proteins (yqgB, mgrB, yobF,
and yceO) were sensitive to acute acid stress. We confirmed each of these
phenotypes in one-on-one competition assays against otherwise-wild-type lacZ
mutant cells. A more detailed investigation of the SsrA phenotype suggests that
ribosome release is critical for resistance to cell envelope stress. The
bar-coded deletion collection we generated can be screened for sensitivity or
resistance to virtually any stress condition.
