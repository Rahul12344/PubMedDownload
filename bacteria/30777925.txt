Swine represent the only livestock with an established invariant NKT (iNKT)
cell-CD1d system. In this study, we exploited the fact that pig iNKT cells can be
purified using a mouse CD1d tetramer reagent to establish their TCR repertoire by
next generation sequencing. CD1d tetramer-positive pig cells predominantly
expressed an invariant Vα-Jα rearrangement, without nontemplate nucleotide
diversity, homologous to the Vα24-Jα18 and Vα14-Jα18 rearrangements of human and 
murine iNKT cells. The coexpressed β-chain used a Vβ segment homologous to the
semivariant Vβ11 and Vβ8.2 segments of human and murine iNKT cell receptors.
Molecular modeling found that contacts within CD1d and CDR1α that underlie fine
specificity differences between mouse and human iNKT cells are conserved between 
pigs and humans, indicating that the response of porcine and human iNKT cells to 
CD1d-restricted Ags may be similar. Accordingly, pigs, which are an important
species for diverse fields of biomedical research, may be useful for developing
human-based iNKT cell therapies for cancer, infectious diseases, and other
disorders. Our study also sequenced the expressed TCR repertoire of conventional 
porcine αβ T cells, which identified 48 Vα, 50 Jα, 18 Vβ, and 18 Jβ sequences,
most of which correspond to human gene segments. These findings provide
information on the αβ TCR usage of pigs, which is understudied and deserves
further attention.
