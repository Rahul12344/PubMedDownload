To study the contribution of T-cell receptors (TCR) to resulting T-cell
responses, we studied three different human αβ TCRs, reactive to the same
gp100-derived peptide presented in the context of HLA-A*0201. When expressed in
primary CD8 T cells, all receptors elicited classic antigen-induced IFN-γ
responses, which correlated with TCR affinity for peptide-MHC in the order
T4H2 > R6C12 > SILv44. However, SILv44 elicited superior IL-17A release.
Importantly, in vivo, SILv44-transgenic T cells mediated superior antitumor
responses to 888-A2 + human melanoma tumor cells upon adoptive transfer into
tumor-challenged mice while maintaining IL-17 expression. Modeling of the TCR
ternary complexes suggested architectural differences between SILv44 and the
other complexes, providing a potential structural basis for the observed
differences. Overall, the data reveal a more prominent role for the T-cell
receptor in defining host T-cell physiology than traditionally assumed, while
parameters beyond IFN-γ secretion and TCR affinity ultimately determine the
reactivity of tumor-reactive T cells.
