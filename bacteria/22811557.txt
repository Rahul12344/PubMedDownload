RATIONALE: Mutations of the orphan transporter ABCC6 (ATP-binding cassette,
subfamily C, member 6) cause the connective tissue disorder pseudoxanthoma
elasticum. ABCC6 was thought to be located on the plasma membrane of liver and
kidney cells.
OBJECTIVE: Mouse systems genetics and bioinformatics suggested that ABCC6
deficiency affects mitochondrial gene expression. We therefore tested whether
ABCC6 associates with mitochondria.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We found ABCC6 in crude mitochondrial fractions and
subsequently pinpointed its localization to the purified mitochondria-associated 
membrane fraction. Cell-surface biotinylation in hepatocytes confirmed that ABCC6
is intracellular. Abcc6-knockout mice demonstrated mitochondrial abnormalities
and decreased respiration reserve capacity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that ABCC6 localizes to the mitochondria-associated
membrane has implications for its mechanism of action in normal and diseased
states.
