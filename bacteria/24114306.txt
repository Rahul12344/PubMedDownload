OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of clinical scores that predict streptococcal 
infection or rapid streptococcal antigen detection tests compared with delayed
antibiotic prescribing.
DESIGN: Open adaptive pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial.
SETTING: Primary care in United Kingdom.
PATIENTS: Patients aged â‰¥ 3 with acute sore throat.
INTERVENTION: An internet programme randomised patients to targeted antibiotic
use according to: delayed antibiotics (the comparator group for analyses),
clinical score, or antigen test used according to clinical score. During the
trial a preliminary streptococcal score (score 1, n=1129) was replaced by a more 
consistent score (score 2, n=631; features: fever during previous 24 hours;
purulence; attends rapidly (within three days after onset of symptoms); inflamed 
tonsils; no cough/coryza (acronym FeverPAIN).
OUTCOMES: Symptom severity reported by patients on a 7 point Likert scale (mean
severity of sore throat/difficulty swallowing for days two to four after the
consultation (primary outcome)), duration of symptoms, use of antibiotics.
RESULTS: For score 1 there were no significant differences between groups. For
score 2, symptom severity was documented in 80% (168/207 (81%) in delayed
antibiotics group; 168/211 (80%) in clinical score group; 166/213 (78%) in
antigen test group). Reported severity of symptoms was lower in the clinical
score group (-0.33, 95% confidence interval -0.64 to -0.02; P=0.04), equivalent
to one in three rating sore throat a slight versus moderate problem, with a
similar reduction for the antigen test group (-0.30, -0.61 to -0.00; P=0.05).
Symptoms rated moderately bad or worse resolved significantly faster in the
clinical score group (hazard ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.63)
but not the antigen test group (1.11, 0.88 to 1.40). In the delayed antibiotics
group, 75/164 (46%) used antibiotics. Use of antibiotics in the clinical score
group (60/161) was 29% lower (adjusted risk ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval
0.50 to 0.95; P=0.02) and in the antigen test group (58/164) was 27% lower (0.73,
0.52 to 0.98; P=0.03). There were no significant differences in complications or 
reconsultations.
CONCLUSION: Targeted use of antibiotics for acute sore throat with a clinical
score improves reported symptoms and reduces antibiotic use. Antigen tests used
according to a clinical score provide similar benefits but with no clear
advantages over a clinical score alone.
