BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of blood vessel leads to aneurysms, myocardial infarction
and other thrombosis conditions. Current treatment strategies are transplantation
of blood vessels from one part of the body to other dysfunction area, or
allogenic, synthetic. Due to shortage of the donor, painful dissection, and lack 
of efficacy in synthetic, there is a need for alternative to native blood vessels
for transplantation.
METHODS: Human umbilical-cord tissue obtained from the hospital with the informed
consent. Umbilical-cord blood vessels were isolated for decellularization and to 
establish endothelial cell culture. Cultured cells were characterized by
immunophenotype, gene expression and in vitro angiogenesis assay. Decellularized 
blood vessels were recellularized with the endothelial progenitors and Wharton
jelly, CL MSCs (1:1), which was characterized by MTT, biomechanical testing, DNA 
content, SEM and histologically. Bioengineered vessels were transplanted into the
animal models to evaluate their effect.
RESULTS: Cultured cells express CD31 and CD14 determining endothelial progenitor 
cells (EPCs). EPCs expresses various factors such as angiopoitin1, VWF, RANTES,
VEGF, BDNF, FGF1, FGF2, HGF, IGF, GDNF, NGF, PLGF, NT3, but fail to express NT4, 
EGF, and CNTF. Pro and anti-inflammatory cytokine expressions were noticed.
Functionally, these EPCs elicit in vitro tube formation. Negligible DNA content
and intact ECM confirms the efficient decellularization of tissue. The increased 
MTT activity in recellularized tissue determines proliferating cells and
biocompatibility of the scaffolds. Moreover, significant (P < 0.05) increase in
maximum force and tensile of recellularized biomaterial as compared to the
decellularized scaffolds. Integration of graft with host tissue, suggesting
biocompatible therapeutic biomaterial with cells.
CONCLUSION: EPCs with stem cells in engineered blood vessels could be
therapeutically applicable in vascular surgery.
