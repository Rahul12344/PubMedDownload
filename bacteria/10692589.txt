Bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) is a member of the transforming growth
factor beta superfamily which induces bone formation and regeneration, and
important steps during early embryonic development. BMP-2 signals via
oligomerization of type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors. We
report here expression of the extracellular domain of the human type IA receptor 
for BMP-2 (BMPR-IA) in Escherichia coli. This soluble form of BMPR-IA (sBMPR-IA) 
was purified employing a BMP-2 affinity column. Gel filtration experiments and
analysis of gel filtration fractions by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and
densitometry reveal that BMP-2 forms a defined 1:2 complex with sBMPR-IA that can
be purified and hopefully used for crystallization studies.
