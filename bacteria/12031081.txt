Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is known to induce the specific immune
response in the gastric mucosa. The immune response is triggered by presentation 
of antigen peptides on the major histocompatibility assembly of the
antigen-presenting cells (APC) with the assistance of costimulatory molecules
such as B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86). Their counter-receptors or ligands on T
cells are CD28 or cytotoxic lymphocyte-associated molecule-4. The aim of the
present study was to clarify the localization of APC and their relation with T
cells in HP-infected human gastric mucosa. Our findings suggest that the
macrophages in the lamina propria may mainly act as APC in the HP-infected
gastric mucosa, and the triggered immune response might be involved in the
mucosal immune response in the inflamed gastric mucosa to invasive antigens
related to HP organisms.
