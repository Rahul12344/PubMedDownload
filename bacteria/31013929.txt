Infertility is a medical concern worldwide and could also have economic
consequences in farmed animals. Developing an efficient diet supplement with
immediate effects on sperm quality is a promising tool for human reproduction and
for domesticated animal species. This study aims at elucidating the effect of a
short-time probiotic supplementation consisting of a mixture of two probiotic
bacteria with proven antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities on zebrafish
sperm quality and male behavior. For this purpose, three homogeneous groups of
males in terms of motility (<60%) were established. The control group was fed
with a normal standard diet. The other received supplements: One group (vehicle
control) was fed with maltodextrin and the other received a probiotic preparation
based on a mixture (1:1) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus CECT8361 and Bifidobacterium 
longum CECT7347. The feeding regime was 21 days corresponding with a single
spermatogenesis in zebrafish. The preparation did not modify animal weight,
positively affected the number of fluent males, increased sperm concentration,
total motility, progressive motility, and fast spermatozoa subpopulations.
Moreover, the animals fed with the supplement showed different behavior patterns 
compared to control groups. Our results suggest a diet-related modulation on the 
exploration activity indicating a lower stress-like conduct. The studied
formulation described here should be considered as advantageous in male
reproductive biotechnology.
