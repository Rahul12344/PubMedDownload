The rise of antibiotic resistance is of great clinical concern. One approach to
reducing the development of resistance is to co-administer two or more
antibiotics with different modes of action. However, it can be difficult to
control the distribution and pharmacokinetics of two drugs to ensure both
concentrations remain within the range of therapeutic efficacy whilst avoiding
adverse effects. Hybrid drugs, where two drugs are linked together with a
flexible linker, have been explored, but the resultant large, flexible molecules 
can have poor bioavailability. We have developed a chimeric approach using click 
chemistry where the pharmacophores of two drugs are overlapped into a single
smaller, more drug-like molecule. Design and selection of compounds were assisted
by in silico structural docking. We prepared a series of compounds that include
candidates showing activity against the targets of both trimethoprim;
dihydrofolate reductase, and ciprofloxacin; DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. The 
resultant triazole containing molecules show modest, but broad spectrum
activities against drug sensitive and resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria, with no observable cytotoxicity.
