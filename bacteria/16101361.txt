BACKGROUND: To investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health
and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the
expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hBD)
in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (HGE) cell cultures from
periodontitis patients by quantitative TaqMan reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR).
METHODS: Several strains of the periodontopathogens Actinobacillus
actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as
well as the oral commensal bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Escherichia coli.
The induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was also tested.
RESULTS: In addition to the published observations (PMA induces hBD-2 and -4;
TNF-alpha induces hBD-2 and -3), it was found that PMA can upregulate hBD-1 and
hBD-3, whereas TNF-alpha can induce hBD-4. The commensal bacteria were
significant inducers of hBD-2, hBD-3, and IL-8. The pathogen P. gingivalis
induced hBD-1 and hBD-3 at different time points than the commensals, but no
induction of IL-8 and hBD-2 could be observed. These data fit with the chemokine 
paralysis theory. A correlation was found between the pathogenicity of different 
serotypes of A. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and
IL-8.
CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral 
epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced and the pathogenicity
of the oral bacterial strains.
