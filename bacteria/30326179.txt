AIM: Potassium (K) is one of the three major nutrients required of plant growth
and muriate of potash (MoP) is the only recognized chemical fertilizer used in
agriculture. In many countries, 100% of the applied MoP is imported costing huge 
revenue. Application of suitable potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB) as
biofertilizer could be an integral part of K management in arable soil. The
object of this study was to evaluate K-solubilizing ability of a ubiquitous
micro-organism as KSB to supplement K in soil.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Strain (O-5) was isolated from tea-growing soil and
identified as Bacillus pseudomycoides. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the
nearest neighbours of B. pseudomycoides strain O-5 were Bacillus cereus, Bacillus
thuringiensis and Bacillus toyonensis. Though the species was first identified in
1998 and is ubiquitous in soil, the role of this group of micro-organisms in
nutrient cycling in soil has not been studied before. Strain solubilized
33·32 ± 2·40 μg K ml-1 in mica waste (MW; muscovite type mineral)-amended broth
after 7 days incubation at 30 ± 1°C. In a soil microcosm study under laboratory
condition, B. pseudomycoides strain O-5 increased K availability by
47·0 ± 7·1 mg kg-1 after 105 days incubation, while the strain released
104·9 ± 15·3 mg K kg-1 in MW-treated soil. In this study, application of isolated
B. pseudomycoides with MW significantly increased K availability in soil, and
that in turn facilitated K uptake by tea plants.
CONCLUSION: Based on the data, it could be inferred that B. pseudomycoides could 
mobilize K from bound form in soil and can be utilized as K-solubilizing
biofertilizer especially in combination with MW for supplementing K in soil.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Bacillus pseudomycoides strain O-5 has
potential to be used as K-solubilizing biofertilizer in agriculture.
