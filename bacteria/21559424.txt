Structurally, Group 1 LILR (Leukocyte Immunoglobulin (Ig)-Like Receptor, also
known as Ig-like transcripts, ILT; Leukocyte Ig-like receptor, LIR; and CD85)
members are very similar in terms of the HLAIs (human leukocyte antigen class I
molecules) binding region and were hypothesized that they all bind to HLAIs. As
one of the Group 1 LILRs, LILRA3 is the only secretory LILR and may greatly
control the inhibitory immune response induced by LILRB1, LILRB2, and other
HLA-binding LILR molecules like LILRA1. Nevertheless, little was known about the 
binding of LILRA3 to HLAIs. In this report, we present the crystal structure of
the LILRA3 domain 1 (D1) and evaluate the D1 and D1D2 (domain 1 and domain 2)
binding to classical and non-classical HLAIs using BIAcoreÂ® surface plasmon
resonance analysis (SPR). We found that LILRA3 binds both classical HLA-A*0201
and non-classical HLA-G1 but with reduced affinities compared to either LILRB1 or
LILRB2. The polymorphic amino acids and the LILRA3 D1 structure support this
notion.
