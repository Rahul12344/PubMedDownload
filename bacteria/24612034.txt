Keratinocytes are able to sense bacteria or bacterial products leading to a rapid
defense reaction by the increased expression of antimicrobial peptides and
cytokines. Recent data by Percoco and collaborators published in Experimental
Dermatology indicate that bacteria colonizing the skin surface induce a
differential spatial expression pattern of antimicrobial peptides and cytokines. 
Using laser capture microdissection followed by real-time PCR as well as
immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy, the authors provide
evidence that antimicrobial peptides such as human beta-defensin (hBD)-2 and -3
were more strongly induced in the uppermost epidermal layers, whereas the main
induction of cytokines such as IL-1beta and IL-6 occurred in the lower parts of
the epidermis.
