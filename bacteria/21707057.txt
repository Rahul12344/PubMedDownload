The 1.51 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of the trans-acyltransferase (AT)
from the "AT-less" disorazole synthase (DSZS) and that of its acetate complex at 
1.35 Å resolution are reported. Separately, comprehensive alanine-scanning
mutagenesis of one of its acyl carrier protein substrates (ACP1 from DSZS) led to
the identification of a conserved Asp45 residue on the ACP, which contributes to 
the substrate specificity of this unusual enzyme. Together, these experimental
findings were used to derive a model for the selective association of the DSZS AT
and its ACP substrate. With a goal of structurally characterizing the AT-ACP
interface, a strategy was developed for covalently cross-linking the active site 
Ser → Cys mutant of the DSZS AT to its ACP substrate and for purifying the
resulting AT-ACP complex to homogeneity. The S86C DSZS AT mutant was found to be 
functional, albeit with a transacylation efficiency 200-fold lower than that of
its wild-type counterpart. Our findings provide new insights as well as new
opportunities for high-resolution analysis of an important protein-protein
interface in polyketide synthases.
