Improved approaches for promoting umbilical cord blood (CB) hematopoietic stem
cell (HSC) homing are clinically important to enhance engraftment of CB-HSCs.
Clinical transplantation of CB-HSCs is used to treat a wide range of disorders.
However, an improved understanding of HSC chemotaxis is needed for facilitation
of the engraftment process. We found that ectopic overexpression of miR-9 and
antisense-miR-9 respectively down- and up-regulated C-X-C chemokine receptor type
4 (CXCR4) expression in CB-CD34＋ cells as well as in 293T and TF-1 cell lines.
Since CXCR4 is a specific receptor for the stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) 
chemotactic factor, we investigated whether sense miR-9 and antisense miR-9
influenced CXCR4-mediated chemotactic mobility of primary CB CD34＋ cells and TF-1
cells. Ectopic overexpression of sense miR-9 and antisense miR-9 respectively
down- and up-regulated SDF-1-mediated chemotactic cell mobility. To our
knowledge, this study is the first to report that miR-9 may play a role in
regulating CXCR4 expression and SDF-1-mediated chemotactic activity of CB CD34＋
cells.
