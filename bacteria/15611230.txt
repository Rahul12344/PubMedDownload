The transfer of membrane proteins from APC to T cells was initially described in 
the 1970s, and subsequent work has described two mechanisms of transfer:
APC-derived exosomes and direct transfer of small packets, while cells remain
conjugated. Using fibroblast APC expressing a GFP-tagged I-E(k) molecule with
covalently attached antigenic peptide, we observed a third mechanism in live cell
imaging: T cells spontaneously dissociating from APC often capture MHC:peptide
complexes directly from the immunological synapse. Using two I-E(k)-restricted
murine TCR transgenic T cells with different peptide specificity, we show in this
study that the MHC transfer is peptide specific. Using blocking Abs, we found
that MHC:peptide transfer in this system requires direct TCR-MHC:peptide
interactions and is augmented by costimulation through CD28-CD80 interactions.
Capture of the GFP-tagged MHC:peptide complexes correlates with an activated
phenotype of the T cell, elevated CD69 with down-modulated TCR. The transferred
MHC:peptide molecules transferred to the T cell are associated with molecules
that imply continued TCR signaling; p56(lck), phosphotyrosine, and polarization
of the actin cytoskeleton.
