Several bacterial pathogens hijack the actin assembly machinery and display
intracellular motility in the cytosol of infected cells. At the cell cortex,
intracellular motility leads to bacterial dissemination through formation of
plasma membrane protrusions that resolve into vacuoles in adjacent cells. Here,
we uncover a crucial role for actin network disassembly in dissemination of
Listeria monocytogenes. We found that defects in the disassembly machinery
decreased the rate of actin tail turnover but did not affect the velocity of the 
bacteria in the cytosol. By contrast, defects in the disassembly machinery had a 
dramatic impact on bacterial dissemination. Our results suggest a model of L.
monocytogenes dissemination in which the disassembly machinery, through local
recycling of the actin network in protrusions, fuels continuous actin assembly at
the bacterial pole and concurrently exhausts cytoskeleton components from the
network distal to the bacterium, which enables membrane apposition and resolution
of protrusions into vacuoles.
