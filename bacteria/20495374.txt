Oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species generated in mitochondria is a
potential cause of stem-cell dysregulation. Little is known about how
hematopoietic stem cells mitigate/lessen this risk in the face of upregulated
mitochondrial biogenesis/function necessary for the energy needs of
differentiation and progenitor expansion. Here we report that upregulation of
mitochondrial mass in mouse hematopoietic stem cells is closely linked to the
appearance of CD34 on their surface, a marker indicating loss of long-term
repopulating ability. These mitochondria have low membrane potential initially,
but become active before exiting the primitive LSK compartment. Steady-state
hematopoiesis perturbed by global expression of SDF-1/CXCL12 transgene causes a
shift in ratios of these mitochondrialy-distinct LSK populations. Based on known 
effects of SDF-1 and signaling by it's receptor, CXCR4, along with finding
primitive progenitors with high mitochondrial mass but low activity, we suggest a
model of asymmetric self-renewing stem cell division that could lessen stem cell 
exposure to oxidative damage.
