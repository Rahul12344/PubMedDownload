BACKGROUND: Efforts to construct the Streptomyces host strain with enhanced
yields of heterologous product have focussed mostly on engineering of primary
metabolism and/or the deletion of endogenous biosynthetic gene clusters. However,
other factors, such as chromosome compactization, have been shown to have a
significant influence on gene expression levels in bacteria and fungi. The
expression of genes and biosynthetic gene clusters may vary significantly
depending on their location within the chromosome. Little is known about the
position effect in actinomycetes, which are important producers of various
industrially relevant bioactive molecules.
RESULTS: To demonstrate an impact of the chromosomal position effect on the
heterologous expression of genes and gene clusters in Streptomyces albus J1074, a
transposon mutant library with randomly distributed transposon that includes a
β-glucuronidase reporter gene was generated. Reporter gene expression levels have
been shown to depend on the position on the chromosome. Using a combination of
the transposon system and a φC31-based vector, the aranciamycin biosynthetic
cluster was introduced randomly into the S. albus genome. The production levels
of aranciamycin varied up to eightfold depending on the location of the gene
cluster within the chromosome of S. albus J1074. One of the isolated mutant
strains with an artificially introduced attachment site produced approximately
50% more aranciamycin than strains with endogenous attBs.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we demonstrate that expression of the reporter gene
and aranciamycin biosynthetic cluster in Streptomyces albus J1074 varies up to
eightfold depending on its position on the chromosome. The integration of the
heterologous cluster into different locations on the chromosome may significantly
influence the titre of the produced substance. This knowledge can be used for the
more efficient engineering of Actinobacteria via the relocation of the
biosynthetic gene clusters and insertion of additional copies of heterologous
constructs in a suitable chromosomal position.
