Field-scale bioremediation of dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethanes (DDTs) and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated farmland soil from the
Shenyang North New Area of China was studied using the bacteria Arthrobacter
globiformis. The additive effects of different concentrations of biosurfactant
rhamnolipids (RLs) and anionic-nonionic mixed surfactant (SDBS-Tween 80) were
evaluated. DDT and PAH removal rates by A. globiformis after 150 days of
remediation were 52.1% and 21.9%, respectively. At the optimum RL concentration
of 5 mg kg-1, DDTs and PAHs had removal rates of 64.3% and 35.6%, respectively,
at 150 days. This was 60.7% and 29.3% higher than the control; 36.9% and 19.8%
higher than soil with RL-5 alone; and 12.2% and 13.8% higher than the A.
globiformis treatment alone. RL-5 can enhance soil enzyme activity and A.
globiformis reproduction during the DDT and PAH biodegradation processes. This
study illustrates a highly efficient, low-cost in situ soil bioremediation
technology that could have practical utility.
