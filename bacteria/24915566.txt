Hinokitiol displays potent antimicrobial activity. It has been used in toothpaste
and oral-care gel to improve the oral lichen planus and reduce halitosis. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of 3 different dental
root canal sealers with hinokitiol (sealers+H) and their physical and biological 
effects. AH Plus (epoxy amine resin-based, AH), Apexit Plus
(calcium-hydroxide-based, AP), and Canals (zinc-oxide-eugenol-based, CA), were
used in this study. The original AH and CA exhibited strong
anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (anti-MRSA) activity, but AP did
not. The setting time, working time, flowability, film thickness, and solubility 
of each sealer+0.2%H complied with ISO 6876:2001. CA+0.2%H exhibited high
cytotoxicity, but the others sealers+0.2%H did not. Because hinokitiol combined
with Zn2+ in CA creates a synergistic effect. The physical tests of AP+0.5%-1%H
complied with ISO 6876:2001, improved antimicrobial activity, inhibited
inflammation genes cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
(HIF-1α) mRNA in MG-63 cells and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF), and
down-regulated lysyl oxidase (LOX) mRNA of HGF. In summary, AH and CA
demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity, but AP did not. Application of
hinokitiol increases AH anti-MRSA activity should less than 0.2% for keep well
flowability. AP+0.5%-1% hinokitiol exhibited strong physical, antibacterial, and 
anti-inflammation potentials, and inhibited S. aureus abscess formation. Applying
an appreciable proportion of hinokitiol to epoxy-amine-resin-based and
calcium-hydroxide-based root canal sealers is warranted, but the enhanced
cytotoxicity and synergistic effect must be considered.
