The expression and interaction between killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors 
(KIRs) and HLA are known to be associated with pathogenesis of diseases,
including hematological malignancies. Presence of B haplotype KIR in donors is
associated with a lower relapse risk for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) after
hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). However, the association of KIR and
HLA repertoire with disease development and other clinical features is not well
studied for AML. In this study, 206 Chinese patients with AML were analyzed for
their FAB subtypes, risk groups, and chemo-responsiveness to assess possible
association with their KIR and HLA profile. The results revealed that a B-content
score of 2 was significantly more prevalent in AML patients when compared to
normal controls. Notably, there is also a differential frequency in the
distribution of B haplotype KIR across distinct FAB subtypes, where the M3
subtype had significantly lower frequencies of B haplotype KIR compared to the M5
subtype (p < 0.05). In addition, the stronger inhibitory KIR ligands HLA-C2 and
HLA-Bw4-80I were present in significantly higher frequencies in the
prognostically "poor" risk group compared to those with "favourable" risk (p <
0.01). Taken together, these associations with clinical features of AML suggest a
role of the KIR-HLA repertoire in the development and biological behavior of AML.
