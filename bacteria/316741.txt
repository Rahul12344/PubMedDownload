Attenuation of virulence by P and V plasmids in Vibrio cholerae: strains suitable
for oral immunization.

Sinha VB, Srivastava BS.

In a virulent strain of Vibrio cholerae, KB9, P and V plasmids were introduced by
bacterial conjugation. Characterization of PV isolates and systematic screening
of them in animal models of cholera revealed that a large number of PV isolates
were non-pathogenic, owing to the loss of ability to synthesize toxin. Results
obtained with two such strains, designated as KB9:PV and CD24, are described. The
strains with plasmids were stable during in vitro cultivation or during two
successive passages in rabbit intestine. Protection conferred by PV strains was
determined in mouse protection tests and in the rabbit ileal loop model. The
plasmid strains were immunogenic. In view of the results, it is proposed that
PV-bearing attenuated strains should be tried in oral immunization.
