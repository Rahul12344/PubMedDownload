Natural genetic diversity offers an important yet largely untapped resource to
decipher the molecular mechanisms regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
function. Latexin (Lxn) is a negative stem cell regulatory gene identified on the
basis of genetic diversity. By using an Lxn knockout mouse model, we found that
Lxn inactivation in vivo led to the physiological expansion of the entire
hematopoietic hierarchy. Loss of Lxn enhanced the competitive repopulation
capacity and survival of HSCs in a cell-intrinsic manner. Gene profiling of
Lxn-null HSCs showed altered expression of genes enriched in cell-matrix and
cell-cell interactions. Thrombospondin 1 (Thbs1) was a potential downstream
target with a dramatic downregulation in Lxn-null HSCs. Enforced expression of
Thbs1 restored the Lxn inactivation-mediated HSC phenotypes. This study reveals
that Lxn plays an important role in the maintenance of homeostatic hematopoiesis,
and it may lead to development of safe and effective approaches to manipulate
HSCs for clinical benefit.
