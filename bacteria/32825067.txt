Brucellosis is an important zoonosis worldwide. Equines are susceptible to the
infection when in close contact with infected animals. The objective of our study
was to update the existing knowledge and detect and differentiate the causative
agent of brucellosis in breeding equines in Punjab, Pakistan. A cross-sectional
study was designed to evaluate the occurrence and etiology of the infection in
the equine population in three districts. A total of 448 equine sera were
collected from three prefectures viz. Sahiwal, Khanewal, and Okara of the Punjab 
Province of Pakistan. Ninety-six (21.4%) samples were found positive by RBPT,
3.56% (16/448) by iELISA, and 4.24% (19/448) by CFT. Real-time PCR demonstrated
the presence of Brucella abortus-DNA in sero-positive samples. Age and location
were found as risk factors. The study concludes equine brucellosis seroprevalence
in the country where Brucella abortus as the main etiology. Fistulous withers and
poll evil cases should be treated with care as they could be hazardous and a
source of zoonotic transmission. Routine screening at an early age, vaccination
in ruminants, and consumption of pasteurized dairy milk in humans is recommended 
for prevention of the infection. Specific tests need to be standardized and
validated.
