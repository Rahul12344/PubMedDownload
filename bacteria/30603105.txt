Background and objective Inflammatory periodontal pockets are known to be
hypoxic. Hypoxia influences vascular response to periodontal inflammation,
including angiogenesis, which is critical for oxygen and nutrient delivery to
periodontal tissues and granulation tissue formation. Our previous work suggests 
that periodontal bacteria may actively contribute to pocket hypoxia. Herein, we
test the hypothesis that Fusobacterium nucleatum actively induces low oxygen
tension, which modulates angiogenesis and endothelial cell activity. HUVEC cells 
were incubated in 1.5% oxygen for (Folkman & Shing, 1992)48 hours. Cell
proliferation was measured by MTT; surface expression of CD31, CD34 and VEGF
receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2) were analyzed by FACS. mRNA expression of HIF
isoforms, iNOS, eNOS, COX-2, and VEGF was measured by quantitative PCR.
Supernatants were analyzed for the release of IL-1α, TNF-α, and VEGF by ELISA or 
multiplex immunoassays and nitric oxide was measured by colorimetric assay. F.
nucleatum actively depleted oxygen. Hypoxia resulted in a significant increase of
HIF isoforms. iNOS was increased while nitric oxide was unchanged. VEGF release
was increased at 4 hours followed by an increase in VEGFR1 at 12 hours, but not
VEGFR2. CD31 expression was reduced and CD34 was increased after 48 hours
(p < 0.05). IL-1α and TNF-α release were decreased at 4 hours (p < 0.05), but
both increased by 24 hours; TNF-α increased at 24 h. The data highlight the role 
of hypoxia in endothelial cell inflammatory changes. F. nucleatum, considered a
bridging species in the development of periodontopathic biofilms induces hypoxia 
in the periodontium leading to angiogenic changes in periodontal disease
pathogenesis.
