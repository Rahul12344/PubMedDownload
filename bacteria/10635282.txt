The diagnosis and management of bad breath can be easily incorporated in routine 
dental care by attending dentists. This article outlines the information
necessary to establish a differential diagnosis of oral malodor. This includes
evaluation of medical, dental, and halitosis history. It also includes the
examination of extraoral and intraoral tissues and a thorough periodontal
examination. The presence of bad breath is established with organoleptic and
hydrogen sulfide-monitor (Halimeter) measurements. The treatment of malodor
resulting from oral overgrowth of anaerobic organisms in the oral cavity consists
of mechanical and chemical reduction of the microbial flora by methods that are
supported by scientific evidence.
