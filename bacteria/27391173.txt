Magnetotactic bacteria possess cellular compartments called magnetosomes that
sense magnetic fields. Alignment of magnetosomes in the bacterial cell is
necessary for their function, and this is achieved through anchoring of
magnetosomes to filaments composed of the protein MamK. MamK is an actin homolog 
that polymerizes upon ATP binding. Here, we report the structure of the MamK
filament at ∼6.5 Å, obtained by cryo-Electron Microscopy. This structure confirms
our previously reported double-stranded, nonstaggered architecture, and reveals
the molecular basis for filament formation. While MamK is closest in sequence to 
the bacterial actin MreB, the longitudinal contacts along each MamK strand most
closely resemble those of eukaryotic actin. In contrast, the cross-strand
interface, with a surprisingly limited set of contacts, is novel among actin
homologs and gives rise to the nonstaggered architecture.
