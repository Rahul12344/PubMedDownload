The suppressor activity of splenic macrophages induced by Mycobacterium
intracellulare infection (MI-M phi s) against T cell concanavalin A (Con A)
mitogenesis is mediated by MI-M phi's mediators, such as reactive nitrogen
intermediates (RNIs), phosphatidylserine, free fatty acids, prostaglandin E(2)
and to a minor extent TGF-beta. Here, we have compared the roles of RNIs and
TGF-beta in the expression of MI-M phi's suppressor activity against Con A
mitogenesis and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb)- and anti-CD28 mAb-induced
mitogenesis (TCR signal-induced mitogenesis) of the target T cells, and have
found the following. First, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA) inhibited MI-M
phi's suppressor activity against TCR signal-induced mitogenesis as well as Con A
mitogenesis. Second, anti-TGF-beta mAb weakly restored the MI-M phi-mediated
suppression only in the case of Con A mitogenesis, under limited conditions, such
as very low cell densities of MI-M phi s. Third, the blocking effects of NMMA
plus anti-TGF-beta mAb were somewhat more prominent in the case of Con A
mitogenesis than in the case of TCR signal-induced mitogenesis. Fourth, Con A- or
TCR signal-stimulated MI-M phi s secreted significant amounts of the latent
TGF-beta but not the active one. These findings indicate that RNIs, but not
TGF-beta, play important roles in the MI-M phi-mediated suppression of TCR
signal-induced mitogenesis, as well as Con A mitogenesis, of the target T cells.
