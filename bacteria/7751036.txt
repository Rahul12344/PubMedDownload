In the present study a total of 300 pregnant women were evaluated, 200 women with
bad obstetrics history (BOH) and 100 clinically normal women. Cervical culture
studies, as well as serological evaluation was carried out in each woman. It was 
noted that among the various microbial agents detected, the presence of genital
mycoplasmas, chlamydia, Toxoplasma gondii and cytomegalovirus was significant.
Foetal outcome could be noted in some of the BOH patients. Toxoplasmosis was
associated with complete abortion (38%), stillbirths (6%), premature delivery
(16%) and congenital anomalies (6%). Cytomegalovirus infection was associated
with complete abortion (41.66%), preterm delivery (33.33%) and congenital
anomalies (8.33%). Ureaplasma infection in BOH patients resulted in preterm
delivery with premature rupture of membranes in 45 per cent of women and complete
abortion in 35 per cent.
