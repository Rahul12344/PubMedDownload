Numerous surveys conducted in North America, Asia and Europe have revealed that
ochratoxin A is a natural contaminant of plant products. Contamination
frequencies of up to 40% have been encountered, at levels in the range of 5-500
micrograms/kg. Ochratoxin A is a major causal determinant of the disease porcine 
nephropathy; but other nephrotoxic mycotoxins, such as citrinin and the fungal
quinones, may be involved. The disease is characterized clinically by polyuria
and growth depression. Renal lesions in pigs include degeneration of the proximal
tubules, interstitial fibrosis and hyalinization of the glomeruli. The disease is
endemic, outbreaks being associated with bad weather conditions. A positive
correlation has been observed between the prevalence rates of porcine nephropathy
and the frequency of ochratoxin A in corresponding feed samples. Surveys for
residues of ochratoxin A in kidneys from cases of porcine nephropathy in a number
of European countries other than Denmark have demonstrated that 21-42% of samples
contain ochratoxin A in the range of 1-100 micrograms/kg.
