BACKGROUND & AIMS: Mucosal natural killer (NK) cells that produce interleukin
(IL)-22 mediate intestinal homeostasis and inflammation in mice. However, their
role in the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) is not
known. We investigated intestinal NK cells in intestinal mucosa samples of
patients with Crohn's disease (CD).
METHODS: We isolated lamina propria NK cells from intestinal mucosal samples of
patients with IBD and subjects without IBD (controls) and analyzed expression
patterns of cell surface molecules and cytokine production. Interactions between 
lamina propria NK cells and intestinal macrophages were examined.
RESULTS: In intestinal mucosa samples from controls, NKp44 and NKp46 were
expressed differentially on CD3(-)CD56(+) NK cells, NKp44(+)NKp46(-) (NKp44(+))
NK cells expressed CD127 and the transcription factor retinoic acid-related
orphan receptor C (RORC) and produced IL-22 whereas NKp44(-)NKp46(+) (NKp46(+))
NK cells did not express CD127 or RORC and produced interferon (IFN)-gamma.
NKp46(+) NK cells were predominant in intestinal mucosa of patients with CD
compared with controls or patients with ulcerative colitis. Upon interaction with
intestinal inflammatory macrophages NKp46(+), NK cells from patients with CD were
activated via IL-23 and produced IFN-gamma; this activation required cell-to-cell
contact.
CONCLUSIONS: The balance of NKp44(+)/NKp46(+) NK cells is disrupted in intestinal
mucosa of patients with CD. NKp46(+) NK cells might mediate the pathogenesis of
CD by producing IFN-gamma.
