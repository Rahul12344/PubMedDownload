BACKGROUND: Gap junctions (GJs) are intercellular channels through which
molecules smaller than 1 kDa can diffuse, and they have been suggested as drug
targets. To develop chemical drugs acting on this target, a high-throughput
screening (HTS) system for GJ modulators is necessary.
RESULTS: We designed a new, high-throughput GJ intercellular communication (GJIC)
assay. This assay system consisted of donor and acceptor cells from LN215 glioma 
cells that expressed SLC26A4 and yellow fluorescent protein-H148Q/I152L
(YFP(QL)), respectively. The fluorescence of LN215-YFP(QL) acceptor cells, when
cultured alone, was not quenched by iodide. However when donor and acceptor
cells, or LN215-YFP(QL) and LN215-I(-) cells, were mixed and plated, they formed 
GJs. When iodide was added, it was transported into donor cells by SLC26A4,
diffused through the GJs to acceptor cells, and quenched the YFP(QL)
fluorescence. The quenching rate was optimal at a 2:1 mixture of donor and
acceptor cells. The assay quality parameter, Z' factor, was calculated from data 
collected with vehicle and carbenoxolone. For each assay, the Z' factor increased
with time. The Z' factor of a 10-s assay was 0.72 indicating that the assay
quality was high enough for use in HTS. This assay system also worked well in HOS
osteosarcoma cells with a Z' factor at 10 s of 0.70.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new HTS system for GJ modulators. The system had a
high assay quality with a Z' factor ≥ 0.70, was rapid and required only 10 s per 
well, was inexpensive in requiring no additional reagents, and was predicted to
have a low rate of false-positive hits.
