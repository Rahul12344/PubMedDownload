Individuals living in malaria endemic areas become clinically immune after
multiple re-infections over time and remain infected without apparent symptoms.
However, it is unclear why a long period is required to gain clinical immunity to
malaria, and how such immunity is maintained. Although malaria infection is
reported to induce inhibition of immune responses, studies on asymptomatic
individuals living in endemic regions of malaria are relatively scarce. We
conducted a cross-sectional study of immune responses in asymptomatic school
children aged 4-16years living in an area where Plasmodium falciparum and
Schistosoma mansoni infections are co-endemic in Kenya. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis and cultured to
determine proliferative responses and cytokine production. The proportions of
cellular subsets in children positive for P. falciparum infection at the level of
microscopy were comparable to the negative children, except for a reduction in
central memory-phenotype CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. In functional
studies, the production of cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in
response to P. falciparum crude antigens exhibited strong heterogeneity among
children. In addition, production of IL-2 in response to anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
monoclonal antibodies was significantly reduced in P. falciparum-positive
children as compared to -negative children, suggesting a state of
unresponsiveness. These data suggest that the quality of T cell immune responses 
is heterogeneous among asymptomatic children living in the endemic region of P.
falciparum, and that the responses are generally suppressed by active infection
with Plasmodium parasites.
