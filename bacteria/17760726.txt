BACKGROUND: The role of Helicobacter pylori in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis remains controversial. The present study was designed to
elucidate the pathogenic role of H. pylori in the early stages of atherosclerosis
by measurement of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in relation to
glucose metabolism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: baPWV level, anti-H. pylori antibody, fasting blood
glucose (FBG), and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other conventional
risk factors for cardiovascular diseases were measured in 947 subjects who
attended their annual medical check-up.
RESULTS: Multiple regression analyses indicated that age, gender (male), body
mass index, FBG, systolic blood pressure, and smoking habits were each
independently related to baPWV values. In younger subjects (30-49 years), H.
pylori seropositivity was significantly correlated with an increase of baPWV
levels (r = 0.100, p = .0445). baPWV values in the H. pylori-positive subjects
with impaired glucose metabolism (IG: FBG >or= 110 mg/dL and/or HbA1c >or= 5.9%) 
were significantly greater than those in the H. pylori-negative subjects with IG 
(p = .0078). Furthermore, H. pylori-positive subjects with IG were at higher risk
for increase of baPWV, in younger (r = 0.203, p < .0001) as well as in older
subjects (50-69 years, r = 0.099, p = .0009).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H. pylori seropositivity is a potential
risk factor for increased baPWV levels, and that H. pylori infection accelerates 
the effect of IG on an increase of baPWV, especially in younger subjects. Thus,
the possible interaction between H. pylori infection and IG may contribute to the
early development of atherosclerosis.
