The NOD-LtSZ scid/scid (NOD/SCID) repopulation assay is the criterion for the
study of self-renewal and multilineage differentiation of human hematopoietic
stem cells. An important shortcoming of this model is the reported absence of
T-cell development. We studied this aspect of the model and investigated how it
could be optimized to support T-cell development. Occasionally, low-grade thymic 
engraftment was observed in NOD/SCID mice or Rag2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) mice. In
contrast, the treatment of NOD/SCID mice with a monoclonal antibody against the
murine interleukin-2R beta, (IL-2R beta) known to decrease natural killer cell
activity, resulted in human thymopoiesis in up to 60% of the mice. T-cell
development was phenotypically normal and resulted in polyclonal, mature, and
functional CD1(-) TCR alpha beta (+) CD4(+) or CD8(+) single-positive T cells. In
mice with ongoing thymopoiesis, peripheral T cells were observed. TREC analysis
showed that T cells with a naive phenotype (CD45RA(+)) emerged from the thymus.
In approximately half of these mice, the peripheral T cells included a
pauciclonal outgrowth of CD45RO(+) cells. These data suggest that all elements of
a functional immune system were present in these animals.
