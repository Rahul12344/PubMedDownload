LonP1 is crucial for maintaining mitochondrial proteostasis and mitigating cell
stress. We identified a novel homozygous missense LONP1 variant, c.2282 C > T,
(p.Pro761Leu), by whole-exome and Sanger sequencing in two siblings born to
healthy consanguineous parents. Both siblings presented with stepwise regression 
during infancy, profound hypotonia and muscle weakness, severe intellectual
disability and progressive cerebellar atrophy on brain imaging. Muscle biopsy
revealed the absence of ragged-red fibers, however, scattered cytochrome c
oxidase-negative staining and electron dense mitochondrial inclusions were
observed. Primary cultured fibroblasts from the siblings showed normal levels of 
mtDNA and mitochondrial transcripts, and normal activities of oxidative
phosphorylation complexes I through V. Interestingly, fibroblasts of both
siblings showed glucose-repressed oxygen consumption compared to their mother,
whereas galactose and palmitic acid utilization were similar. Notably, the
siblings' fibroblasts had reduced pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and
elevated intracellular lactate:pyruvate ratios, whereas plasma ratios were
normal. We demonstrated that in the siblings' fibroblasts, PDH dysfunction was
caused by increased levels of the phosphorylated E1α subunit of PDH, which
inhibits enzyme activity. Blocking E1α phosphorylation activated PDH and reduced 
intracellular lactate concentrations. In addition, overexpressing wild-type LonP1
in the siblings' fibroblasts down-regulated phosphoE1α. Furthermore, in vitro
studies demonstrated that purified LonP1-P761L failed to degrade phosphorylated
E1α, in contrast to wild-type LonP1. We propose a novel mechanism whereby
homozygous expression of the LonP1-P761L variant leads to PDH deficiency and
energy metabolism dysfunction, which promotes severe neurologic impairment and
neurodegeneration.
