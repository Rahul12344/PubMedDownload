In HIV-infected, combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-treated patients,
immune activation and microbial translocation persist and associate with
inadequate CD4 recovery and morbidity/mortality. We analyzed whether alterations 
in the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway could be responsible for the immune
hyperactivation seen in these patients. PBMC/monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) 
of 28 HIV+ untreated and 35 cART-treated patients with HIV-RNA < 40 cp/mL [20
Full Responders (FRs): CD4 ≥ 350; 15 Immunological Non-Responders (INRs):
CD4 < 350], as well as of 16 healthy controls were stimulated with a panel of TLR
agonists. We measured: CD4/CD8/CD14/CD38/HLA-DR/Ki67/AnnexinV/CD69/TLR4/8 (Flow
Cytometry); PBMC expression of 84 TLR pathway genes (qPCR); PBMC/MDM cytokine
release (Multiplex); and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/sCD14 (LAL/ELISA).
PBMC/MDM from cART patients responded weakly to LPS stimulation but released high
amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. MDM from these patients were characterized
by a reduced expression of HLA-DR+ MDM and failed to expand activated HLA-DR+
CD38+ T-lymphocytes. PBMC/MDM from cART patients responded more robustly to ssRNA
stimulation; this resulted in a significant expansion of activated CD38 + CD8 and
the release of amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines comparable to those seen in 
untreated viremic patients. Despite greater constitutive TLR pathway gene
expression, PBMC from INRs seemed to upregulate only type I IFN genes following
TLR stimulation, whereas PBMC from full responders showed a broader response.
Systemic exposure to microbial antigens drives immune activation during cART by
triggering TLRs. Bacterial stimulation modifies MDM function/pro-inflammatory
profile in cART patients without affecting T-lymphocytes; this suggests
translocating bacteria as selective stimulus to chronic innate activation during 
cART. High constitutive TLR activation is seen in patients lacking CD4 recovery, 
suggesting an exhausted immune milieu, anergic to further antigen encounters.
