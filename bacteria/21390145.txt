AIM: To investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination 
on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis.
METHODS: Human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with
Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) GG (LGG(®)), L. rhamnosus Lc705 (Lc705),
Propionibacterium freudenreichii ssp. shermanii JS (PJS) and Bifidobacterium
animalis ssp. lactis Bb12 (Bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were
subjected to global microarray analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip(®) Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The gene expression differences between unstimulated 
and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with GOrilla Gene
Enrichment Analysis and Visualization Tool and MeV Multiexperiment Viewer-tool.
RESULTS: LGG and Lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded
allergy-related high-affinity IgE receptor subunits α and γ (FCER1A and FCER1G,
respectively) and histamine H4 receptor. LGG, Lc705 and the combination of four
probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast
cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a 
pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour necrosis factor
alpha. Also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as
IL-10, were upregulated.
CONCLUSION: Certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related
activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity IgE and histamine
receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.
