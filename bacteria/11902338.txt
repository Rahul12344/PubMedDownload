Proliferative responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to group A
streptococcal (GAS) antigens have been studied in 24 patients with psoriasis and 
15 disease controls. Extracts of cell wall (including M protein) from types M4
and M12 GAS, recombinant M6 protein, and both cell-wall and cell-membrane
extracts from type M6 (M6+) GAS and its corresponding M gene deletion mutant
(M6-) were tested. PBMC from psoriatic patients proliferated more strongly to
cell-wall extracts from M12 versus M4 (P = 0.0348), and to M6+ versus M6- (P =
0.0019) GAS with, in most cases, moderate proliferation to recombinant M6
protein. The psoriatic response to M12 cell wall was significantly increased
compared to the controls (P = 0.0032). In psoriatics, M6+ membrane extracts
induced a markedly greater proliferation than those of cell wall (P = 0.0002);
responses to M6+ (P = 0.0039) and M6- (P = 0.0114) membrane extracts were higher 
than those of the control PBMC. Both groups showed a decreased response to the
M6- versus M6+ membrane extracts (P = 0.0030; P = 0.0181, respectively). This
study has demonstrated that patients with psoriasis have a heightened circulating
T-cell response to cell wall M protein and to non-M proteins present on the cell 
wall and membrane of GAS.
