The bacterial effector protein RavZ is secreted by the intracellular pathogen
Legionella pneumophila and inhibits host autophagy through an irreversible
deconjugation of mammalian ATG8 (mATG8) proteins from autophagosome membranes.
However, the roles of the LC3 interacting region (LIR) motifs in RavZ function
remain unclear. In this study, we show that a membrane-targeting (MT) domain or
the LIR motifs of RavZ play major or minor roles in RavZ function. A RavZ mutant 
that does not bind to mATG8 delipidated all forms of
mATG8-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as efficiently as did wild-type RavZ.
However, a RavZ mutant with a deletion of the MT domain selectively delipidated
mATG8-PE less efficiently than did wild-type RavZ. Taken together, our results
suggest that the effects of LIR motifs and the MT domain on RavZ activity are
complementary and work through independent pathways. [BMB Reports 2019; 52(12):
