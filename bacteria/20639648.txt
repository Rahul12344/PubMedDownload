A new molecular biology technique was used in 2 subjects with systemic
inflammatory response syndrome and negative blood cultures, in which
broad-spectrum antibiotics were administered, without a visible improvement. Case
1: A 33-year-old female patient with a diagnosis of septic shock originating in
the abdomen was admitted in a bad general state, presenting with systemic
inflammatory response. The patient's general condition did not improve. As an
alternative, we used molecular biology. Candida krusei was reported and the
patient responded well to the treatment. Case 2: A woman in the 36th week of
pregnancy, with diabetes mellitus and secondary renal insufficiency, presented
with fever and hematological alterations. The patient's progress was slow and
accompanied by persistent fever, bandemia and leukopenia, as well as signs of
multiple organ dysfunction. The SeptiFast test identified Enterobacter
cloacae/aerogenes as the cause of the disorder. However, the patient died 24 h
after the antibiotics were changed.
