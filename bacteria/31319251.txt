The residues of dieldrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT),
internationally-banned agricultural insecticides, continue to exceed government
guidelines in some surface soils 30 years after use. Little is known regarding
the soil factors and microbial community dynamics associated with the in-situ
biodegradation of these organochlorine chemicals. We hypothesised that soil
organic matter, a key factor affecting microbial biomass and diversity, affects
the biodegradation and total loss of the pollutants 30 years after use. We
sampled 12 contaminated paddocks with residue concentrations monitoring data
since 1988 that represent two different agricultural surface-soils. The total
loss and current concentrations of the residues was correlated with soil
physicochemical properties, microbial biomass carbon, microbial community
diversity indices and microbial community abundance. Current dieldrin and DDT
residue concentrations were positively correlated with soil organic matter and
clay contents. However, key indicators for loss of residues after 23-30 years
were low carbon-to‑nitrogen ratios, high microbial-C-to-total-C ratios and high
fungal community evenness. The results support the composition of soil organic
matter as an important factor affecting degradation of organochlorines and that
co-metabolism of dieldrin and DDT could be enhanced by manipulating the
composition of soil organic matter to cater for a broad diversity of microbial
function.
