Pneumococcus remains the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia
worldwide. Streptococcus pneumoniae is well adapted to people, and is a frequent 
inhabitant of the upper airways in healthy hosts. This seemingly innocuous state 
of colonisation is a dynamic and competitive process in which the pathogen
attempts to engage the host, proliferate, and invade the lower airways. The host 
in turn continuously deploys an array of innate and acquired cellular and humoral
defences to prevent pneumococci from breaching tissue barriers. Discoveries into 
essential molecular mechanisms used by pneumococci to evade host-sensing systems 
that are designed to contain the pathogen provide new insights into potential
treatment options. Versatility of the genome of pneumococci and the bacteria's
polygenic virulence capabilities show that a multifaceted approach with many
vaccine antigens, antibiotic combinations, and immunoadjuvant therapies will be
needed to control this microbe.
