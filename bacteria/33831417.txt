Tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), are neurodegenerative disorders
characterized by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates.
Proteopathic tau seeds spread through the brain in a temporospatial pattern,
indicative of transsynaptic propagation. It is hypothesized that reducing the
uptake of tau seeds and subsequent induction of tau aggregation could be a
potential approach for abrogating disease progression in AD. Here, we studied to 
what extent different endosomal routes play a role in the neuronal uptake of
pre-formed tau seeds. Using pharmacological and genetic tools we identified
dynamin-1, actin and Rac1 as key players. Furthermore, inhibition of PIKfyve, a
protein downstream of Rac1, reduced both the trafficking of tau seeds into
lysosomes as well as the induction of tau aggregation. Our work shows that tau
aggregates are internalized by a specific endocytic mechanism and that their fate
once internalized can be pharmacologically modulated to reduce tau seeding in
neurons.
