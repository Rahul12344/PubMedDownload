Nanometer-scale silicate platelet (NSP) materials were previously developed by
increasing the interlayer space and exfoliation of layered silicate clays such as
montmorillonite and synthetic fluorinated mica by the process of polyamine
exfoliation. In this study, the antibacterial activity and cytotoxicity of these 
nanometer-scale silicate clays were evaluated. The derivatives of NSP (NSP-S)
which were modified by C18-fatty amine salts via ionic exchange association
exhibited the highest antibacterial activity in the aqueous state among all
clays. The high antibacterial activity, however, was accompanied by elevated
cytotoxicity. The variations of cell surface markers (CD29 and CD44) and type I
collagen expression of fibroblasts treated with the clays were measured to
clarify the mechanism of the silicate-induced cytotoxicity. The signal
transduction pathway involved the downregulation of
extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which appeared to participate in
silicate-induced cytotoxicity. This study helped to understand the antibacterial 
potential of NSP and the interaction of natural and modified clays with cellular 
activities.
