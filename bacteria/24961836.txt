OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and clinical severity of whooping cough
(pertussis) in school age children presenting with persistent cough in primary
care since the introduction and implementation of the preschool pertussis booster
vaccination.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort study (November 2010 to December 2012).
SETTING: General practices in Thames Valley, UK.
PARTICIPANTS: 279 children aged 5 to 15 years who presented in primary care with 
a persistent cough of two to eight weeks' duration. Exclusion criteria were cough
likely to be caused by a serious underlying medical condition, known
immunodeficiency or immunocompromise, participation in another clinical research 
study, and preschool pertussis booster vaccination received less than one year
previously.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence of recent pertussis infection based on an oral
fluid anti-pertussis toxin IgG titre of at least 70 arbitrary units. Cough
frequency was measured in six children with laboratory confirmed pertussis.
RESULTS: 56 (20%, 95% confidence interval 16% to 25%) children had evidence of
recent pertussis infection, including 39 (18%, 13% to 24%) of 215 children who
had been fully vaccinated. The risk of pertussis was more than three times higher
(21/53; 40%, 26% to 54%) in children who had received the preschool pertussis
booster vaccination seven years or more previously than in those who had received
it less than seven years previously (20/171; 12%, 7% to 17%). The risk of
pertussis was similar between children who received five and three component
preschool pertussis booster vaccines (risk ratio for five component vaccine 1.14,
0.64 to 2.03). Four of six children in whom cough frequency was measured coughed 
more than 400 times in 24 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Pertussis can still be found in a fifth of school age children who
present in primary care with persistent cough and can cause clinically
significant cough in fully vaccinated children. These findings will help to
inform consideration of the need for an adolescent pertussis booster vaccination 
in the United Kingdom.
