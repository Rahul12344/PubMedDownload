BACKGROUND: IgA-dominant postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) is a unique
form of PIGN. It has been linked to staphylococcal infection and underlying
diabetic glomerulosclerosis. However, the significance of glomerular IgA-dominant
deposition in PIGN remains unclear.
METHODS: We reported 10 patients with IgA-dominant PIGN encountered at a single
center, each characterized by subepithelial humps. Their demographic, clinical,
and renal biopsy findings were summarized and compared with the data of 32
patients with non-IgA-dominant PIGN.
RESULTS: The mean age was 57 years. An immunocompromised background was present
in 70% of patients; only one patient had diabetes mellitus. The causative
infectious agents included Staphylococcus (30%), Streptococcus (20%), and
gram-negative organisms (50%). Decreased serum complement was present in 60%.
Increased serum IgA was noted in 75%. The mean peak serum creatinine was
5.1 mg/dL, and 20% required acute dialysis. Diffuse endocapillary-proliferative
glomerulonephritis was found in all cases, and three patients also had crescentic
glomerulonephritis. Electron microscopy revealed large subepithelial hump-shaped 
deposits in all cases. At the last follow-up, one patient had died, five had
achieved complete recovery, three had persistent renal insufficiency, and one was
on chronic dialysis. Compared to patients with non-IgA-dominant PIGN, increased
serum IgA was more commonly present in IgA-dominant group (p = 0.007). There were
no significant differences in other clinical parameters and outcome between the
two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: IgA-dominant PIGN resembles poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis in 
its histological spectrum and ultrastructural appearance. Increasing serum IgA
may be involved in the pathogenesis of this form of PIGN. Our data suggested that
IgA-dominant PIGN was not peculiar to staphylococcal infection and diabetic
patients.
