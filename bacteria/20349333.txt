Human cell-derived in vitro protein synthesis systems are useful for the
production of recombinant proteins. Productivity can be increased by
supplementation with GADD34, a protein that is difficult to express in and purify
from E. coli. Deletion of the N-terminal 120 or 240 amino acids of GADD34
improves recovery of this protein from E. coli without compromising its ability
to boost protein synthesis in an in vitro protein synthesis system. The use of
N-terminally truncated GADD34 proteins in place of full-length GADD34 should
improve the utility of human cell-based cell-free protein synthesis systems.
