PPE68 is a Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific protein which is absent from the
vaccine strains of BCG. A panel of 14 PPE68-derived peptides predicted to bind to
HLA-A*0201 was synthesized. The HLA-A*0201 restriction of these peptides was
determined in T2 cell line and HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice. The specificity of
peptides was assessed in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients using IFN-γ
enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, and immunodominant peptides were
further used to evaluate their diagnostic potential in HLA-A*0201-positive
pulmonary TB patients. 13 out of 14 peptides were identified as high-affinity
binders. Of these peptides, 12 peptides induced significant IFN-γ-secreting T
cell response in transgenic mice and 9 peptides were efficiently recognized by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 10 HLA-A*0201-positive TB patients. Four
immunodominant HLA-A*0201-restricted epitopes (PPE68126-134, PPE68133-141,
PPE68140-148, and PPE68148-156) were recognized by the most of 80
HLA-A*0201-positive TB patients (81, 86, 74, and 84 %, respectively). These
epitopes may be used for a potential diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection.
