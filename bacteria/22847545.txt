PURPOSE: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae
affecting mainly skin and peripheral nerves. Acute inflammatory episodes in the
borderline immunological spectrum of the disease cause severe nerve and tissue
damage leading to deformities. Finding of any serological marker for leprosy
reactions will help in prediction of reactions and in early treatment
intervention. The objective of this study was to measure the serum circulatory
levels of Interleukin 17F (IL 17F) and to correlate the levels with type 1 and
type 2 reactional states and with clinico-histopathological spectrum of leprosy. 
We studied IL 17F to delineate its role and its clinical implications in leprosy 
reactions.
METHODS: Patients were classified based on the Ridley DS and Jopling WH
Classification and blood samples (5 ml each) were collected from 80 active
untreated leprosy cases in Type 1 reaction (T1R), 21 cases in Type 2 (Erythema
Nodosum Leprosum ENL) reaction (T2R), 80 cases without reaction (NR), and 94
non-leprosy cases (NL). Serum was separated and measured for IL 17F levels using 
ELISA (Commercial Kits, R&D Systems Inc., USA).
RESULTS: IL 17F levels were significantly higher in the T1R group when compared
to the NR group (p < 0.001). The borderline lepromatous group showed the highest 
levels of IL 17F among the other groups in the disease spectrum. Bacteriological 
index (BI) showed negative correlation with the IL 17F levels.
CONCLUSION: The results specify that serum circulatory levels of IL 17F are
elevated during T1Rs in the borderline spectrum of the disease and thus may play 
a role in the regulation of inflammatory responses associated with reactions in
leprosy.
