AIM: To improve the refolding efficiency of soluble HLA-A2-peptide complex in
vitro.
METHODS: The heavy chain (HC) of MHC class I was extracted from bacteria under
denaturing and non-reducing conditions. Anion-exchange and (NH4)2SO4
precipitation were applied to purify the HC. Then the purified HC, beta2m and an 
antigenic peptide (N-YMDGTMSQV-COOH of Try(369-377)) were refolded to form an
HLA-A2-peptide complex by dilution method in the buffer of pH 6.6. The refolded
products were detected by Western blot and ELISA with W6/32 and anti-human beta2m
antibody.
RESULTS: The refolded products consisted of HLA-A2-peptide complex, beta2m, and a
little amount of HC polymer. The refolding efficiency was 2.5 fold higher than
that of the conventional method.
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the refolding efficiency of the method
reported in this paper is higher as compared with the conventional method, which 
is of importance to the preparation of HLA-peptide tetramers and artificial
antigen presenting cells.
