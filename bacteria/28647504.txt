The aim of the present study was to isolate and evaluate the antimicrobial
potential of soil actinomycetes of Kashmir Himalayas. The secondary metabolites
of actinomycetes are the prominent source of antibiotics. A total of 121
morphologically different actinomycete strains were isolated and screened for
antimicrobial activity against various human pathogens. The ethyl acetate extract
of fermented broth an actinomycete strain, identified as Streptomyces pratensis
exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC
29213 with MIC 0.25 μg/ml and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Strain H37Rv with MIC
0.062 μg/ml. The strain S. pratensis IIIM06 was grown on large scale and their
broth was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extract was subjected to various
chromatography techniques which led to the isolation of four compounds whose
structures were established as actinomycin C1, actinomycin C2, actinomycin C3 and
actiphenol on the basis of spectral data analysis. Actinomycin C1, C2 and C3
exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against S. aureus as well as
M. tuberculosis. The isolated indigenous actinomycetes exhibited good
antibacterial activity and the study reveals that IIIM06 is a promising strain
and could be of great potential for industrial applications.
