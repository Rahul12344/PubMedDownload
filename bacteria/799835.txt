Biological activity of microorganism is related to water activity (aw). In this
paper the effect of glicerol as humectant on Saccharomyces cerevisiae viability
was considered. The irreversible loss of viability was observed only for values
inferior than 0,75. The K+ presence promoted an increasing of cell viability and 
growth. We have evaluated the changes of the most important components of cell
poll; the increasing of glicerol amount of the system induced a drastic fall of
aminoacids, purines and K ions content, but it increased the Na ions content. The
exposure of cells to increasing glicerol concentrations, caused an aminoacids and
purines excretion related to contact time; after a few hours this material was
readsorbed by cells.
