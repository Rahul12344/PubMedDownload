The idea you could use lactic acid bacteria to treat and prevent recurrence of
vaginal infections was ridiculed in the early 1980s. Bacteria were the bad guys
to be eradicated by current and emerging antibiotic classes. Thirty years later, 
probiotic administration of microbes is widespread worldwide, including for
vaginal and bladder health in women, and the scientific basis and clinical
efficacy data for this and multiple other applications prove the viability of
this concept. The development of this approach, the creation of a definition for 
probiotics, and the expansion to other areas of women's health form the basis of 
this review.
