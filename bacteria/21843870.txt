The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi is primarily transmitted to
vertebrates by Ixodes ticks. The classical and alternative complement pathways
are important in Borrelia eradication by the vertebrate host. We recently
identified a tick salivary protein, designated P8, which reduced
complement-mediated killing of Borrelia. We now discover that P8 interferes with 
the human lectin complement cascade, resulting in impaired neutrophil
phagocytosis and chemotaxis and diminished Borrelia lysis. Therefore, P8 was
renamed the tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor (TSLPI). TSLPI-silenced ticks,
or ticks exposed to TSLPI-immune mice, were hampered in Borrelia transmission.
Moreover, Borrelia acquisition and persistence in tick midguts was impaired in
ticks feeding on TSLPI-immunized, B. burgdorferi-infected mice. Together, our
findings suggest an essential role for the lectin complement cascade in Borrelia 
eradication and demonstrate how a vector-borne pathogen co-opts a vector protein 
to facilitate early mammalian infection and vector colonization.
