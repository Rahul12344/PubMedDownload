It has been proposed that heterogeneity in natural killer (NK)-cell phenotype and
function can be achieved through distinct thymic and bone marrow pathways of
NK-cell development. Here, we show a link between Notch signaling and the
generation of intracellular CD3epsilon (cyCD3)-expressing NK cells, a cell
population that can be detected in vivo. Differentiation of human CD34(+) cord
blood progenitors in IL-15-supplemented fetal thymus organ culture or
OP9-Delta-like 1 (DL1) coculture resulted in a high percentage of cyCD3(+) NK
cells that was blocked by the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. The requirement for
Notch signaling to generate cyCD3(+) NK cells was further illustrated by
transduction of CD34(+) cord blood (CB) cells with either the active
intracellular part of Notch or the dominant-negative mutant of mastermind-like
protein 1 that resulted in the generation of NK cells with respectively high or
low frequencies of cyCD3. Human thymic CD34(+) progenitor cells displayed the
potential to generate cyCD3(+) NK cells, even in the absence of Notch/DL1
signaling. Peripheral blood NK cells were unable to induce cyCD3 expression after
DL1 exposure, indicating that Notch-dependent cyCD3 expression can only be
achieved during the early phase of NK-cell differentiation.
