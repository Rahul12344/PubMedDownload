BACKGROUND: Streptococcus thermophilus is a major dairy starter used for
manufacturing of dairy products. In the present study, we developed a multilocus 
sequence typing (MLST) scheme for this important food bacterium. Sequences of 10 
housekeeping genes (carB, clpX, dnaA, murC, murE, pepN, pepX, pyrG, recA, and
rpoB) were obtained for 239 S. thermophilus strains, which were isolated from
home-made fermented dairy foods in 18 different regions of Mongolia and China.
METHODS: All 10 genes of S. thermophilus were sequenced, aligned, and defined
sequence types (STs) using the BioNumerics Software. The nucleotide diversity was
calculated by START v2.0. The population structure, phylogenetic relationships
and the role of recombination were inferred using ClonalFrame v1.2, SplitsTree
4.0 and Structure v2.3.
RESULTS: The 239 S. thermophilus isolates and 18 reference strains could be
assigned into 119 different STs, which could be further separated into 16 clonal 
complexes (CCs) and 38 singletons. Among the 10 loci, a total of 132 polymorphic 
sites were detected. The standardized index of association (IAS=0.0916),
split-decomposition and ρ/θ (relative frequency of occurrence of recombination
and mutation) and r/m value (relative impact of recombination and mutation in the
diversification) confirms that recombination may have occurred, but it occurred
at a low frequency in these 10 loci. Phylogenetic trees indicated that there were
five lineages in the S. thermophilus isolates used in our study. MSTree and
ClonalFrame tree analyses suggest that the evolution of S. thermophilus isolates 
have little relationship with geographic locality, but revealed no association
with the types of fermented dairy product. Phylogenetic analysis of 36 whole
genome strains (18 S. thermophilus, 2 S. vestibularis and 16 S. salivarius
strains) indicated that our MLST scheme could clearly separate three closely
related species within the salivarius group and is suitable for analyzing the
population structure of the other two species in the salivarius group.
CONCLUSIONS: Our newly developed MLST scheme improved the understanding on the
genetic diversity and population structure of the S. thermophilus, as well as
provided useful information for further studies on the genotyping and
evolutionary research for S. thermophilus strains with global diversity.
