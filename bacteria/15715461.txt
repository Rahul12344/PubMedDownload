N,O-Didansyl-L-tyrosine (DDT) represented the starting lead for further
development of novel non-substrate-like inhibitors of bacterial thymidylate
synthase. The N-dansyl structure modulation led to a submicromolar inhibitor of
Lactobacillus casei TS (LcTS), which is highly specific with respect to human TS 
(hTS). Using molecular dynamics simulation, a binding mode for DDT vs LcTS was
predicted, explaining activity and species-specificity along the series.
