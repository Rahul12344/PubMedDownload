The discovery of new genetic determinants of inherited skin disorders has been
instrumental to the understanding of epidermal function, differentiation, and
renewal. Here, we show that mutations in KDSR (3-ketodihydrosphingosine
reductase), encoding an enzyme in the ceramide synthesis pathway, lead to a
previously undescribed recessive Mendelian disorder in the progressive symmetric 
erythrokeratoderma spectrum. This disorder is characterized by severe lesions of 
thick scaly skin on the face and genitals and thickened, red, and scaly skin on
the hands and feet. Although exome sequencing revealed several of the KDSR
mutations, we employed genome sequencing to discover a pathogenic 346 kb
inversion in multiple probands, and cDNA sequencing and a splicing assay
established that two mutations, including a recurrent silent third base change,
cause exon skipping. Immunohistochemistry and yeast complementation studies
demonstrated that the mutations cause defects in KDSR function. Systemic
isotretinoin therapy has achieved nearly complete resolution in the two probands 
in whom it has been applied, consistent with the effects of retinoic acid on
alternative pathways for ceramide generation.
