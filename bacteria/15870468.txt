Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human fungal pathogen that also serves as
a model for studies of fungal pathogenesis. C. neoformans contains several genes 
encoding peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), enzymes that catalyse
changes in the folding and conformation of target proteins. Three distinct
classes of PPIases have been identified: cyclophilins, FK506-binding proteins
(FKBPs) and parvulins. This paper reports the cloning and characterization of
ESS1, which is believed to be the first (and probably only) parvulin-class PPIase
in C. neoformans. It is shown that ESS1 from C. neoformans is structurally and
functionally homologous to ESS1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which encodes an
essential PPIase that interacts with RNA polymerase II and plays a role in
transcription. In C. neoformans, ESS1 was found to be dispensable for growth,
haploid fruiting and capsule formation. However, ESS1 was required for virulence 
in a murine model of cryptococcosis. Loss of virulence might have been due to the
defects in melanin and urease production observed in ess1 mutants, or to defects 
in transcription of as-yet-unidentified virulence genes. The fact that Ess1 is
not essential in C. neoformans suggests that, in this organism, some of its
functions might be subsumed by other prolyl isomerases, in particular,
cyclophilins Cpa1 or Cpa2. This is supported by the finding that ess1 mutants
were hypersensitive to cyclosporin A. C. neoformans might therefore be a useful
organism in which to investigate crosstalk among different families of prolyl
isomerases.
