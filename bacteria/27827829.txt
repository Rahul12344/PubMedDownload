Several growth factors (GFs) that together promote quiescent human hematopoietic 
stem cell (HSC) expansion ex vivo have been identified; however, the molecular
mechanisms by which these GFs regulate the survival, proliferation. and
differentiation of human HSCs remain poorly understood. We now describe
experiments in which we used mass cytometry to simultaneously measure multiple
surface markers, transcription factors, active signaling intermediates,
viability, and cell-cycle indicators in single CD34+ cord blood cells before and 
up to 2 hours after their stimulation with stem cell factor, Fms-like tyrosine
kinase 3 ligand, interleukin-3, interleukin-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (5 GFs) either alone or combined. Cells with a
CD34+CD38-CD45RA-CD90+CD49f+ (CD49f+) phenotype (∼10% HSCs with >6-month
repopulating activity in immunodeficient mice) displayed rapid increases in
activated STAT1/3/5, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, AKT, CREB, and S6
by 1 or more of these GFs, and β-catenin only when the 5 GFs were combined.
Certain minority subsets within the CD49f+ compartment were poorly GF-responsive 
and, among the more GF-responsive subsets of CD49f+ cells, different signaling
intermediates correlated with the levels of the myeloid- and lymphoid-associated 
transcription factors measured. Phenotypically similar, but CD90-CD49f- cells
(MPPs) contained lower baseline levels of multiple signaling intermediates than
the CD90+CD49f+ cells, but showed similar response amplitudes to the same GFs.
Importantly, we found activation or inhibition of AKT and β-catenin directly
altered immediate CD49f+ cell survival and proliferation. These findings identify
rapid signaling events that 5 GFs elicit directly in the most primitive human
hematopoietic cell types to promote their survival and proliferation.
