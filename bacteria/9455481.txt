The nucleotide sequence of a 45,137-bp segment covering the 19 degrees and 23
degrees region in the 360 degrees map of the Bacillus subtilis genome was
determined. This region contained 45 open reading frames (ORFs) including 7 which
corresponded to the products of genes with known functions that had been
previously sequenced. The known genes were: glpT and glpQ for glycerol
utilization pathway; purT for a part of the purine synthesis pathway; mpr for an 
extracellular metalloprotease; pss and psd for the parts of the phospholipid
synthesis pathway; and gltP for a glutamine transporter. Deduced amino acid
sequences of the 22 newly identified ORFs showed significant homologies to known 
gene products in the database such as a Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) gene which is related to drug resistance, a two-component response 
regulator, a series of amino acid permeases, transcriptional regulators,
beta-lactamase, the phosphotransferase system (PTS) enzyme II for sugar uptake,
and the eukaryotic ECA39 gene which is associated with cancer and apoptosis, etc.
The remaining 16 ORFs did not show any significant sequence similarities to known
gene products in the database.
