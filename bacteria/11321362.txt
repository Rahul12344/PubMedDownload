In the present study, the effect of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) on intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF)
stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) was investigated. LPS were isolated
from periodontopathic bacteria, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.
actinomycetemcomitans) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), by the
phenol-water method and Escherichia coli (E. coli) LPS was used as a control.
PGE2 significantly inhibited A. actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E.
coli-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression. Next, of four PGE2 receptor subtypes (EP1,
EP2, EP3 and EP4), we examined which subtype(s) was involved in inhibition of
LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression by PGE2. Eleven-deoxy-PGE1, a selective EP2/EP4
agonist, and butaprost, a selective EP2 agonist, attenuated A.
actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1
expression, although butaprost was less potent than PGE2 and 11-deoxy-PGE1.
Sulprostone, an EP1/EP3 agonist, and ONO-AP-324, an EP3 agonist, was inert to the
LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP, a cAMP analogue, and
forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, downregulated A.
actinomycetemcomitans-, P. gingivalis- and E. coli-LPS-elicited ICAM-1 expression
in HGF. Our data suggest that PGE2 downregulates A. actinomycetemcomitans- and P.
gingivalis-LPS-induced ICAM-1 expression in HGF, via EP2/EP4 receptors by
cAMP-dependent signaling pathways. The cAMP-elevating agents such as EP2/EP4
receptor activators may serve to control inflammatory and immune responses in
periodontal disease.
