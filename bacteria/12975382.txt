The tyrosine kinase Src is present on the Golgi membranes. Its role, however, in 
the overall function and organization of the Golgi apparatus is unclear. We have 
found that in a cell line called SYF, which lacks the three ubiquitous Src-like
kinases (Src, Yes, and Fyn), the organization of the Golgi apparatus is
perturbed. The Golgi apparatus is composed of collapsed stacks and bloated
cisternae in these cells. Expression of an activated form of Src relocated the
KDEL receptor (KDEL-R) from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum.
Other Golgi-specific marker proteins were not affected under these conditions.
Because of the specific effect of Src on the location of KDEL-R, we tested
whether protein transport between ER and the Golgi apparatus involves Src.
Transport of Pseudomonas exotoxin, which is transported to the ER by binding to
the KDEL-R is accelerated by inhibition or genetic ablation of Src. Protein
transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus however, is unaffected by Src deletion
or inhibition. We propose that Src has an appreciable role in the organization of
the Golgi apparatus, which may be linked to its involvement in protein transport 
from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum.
