BACKGROUND: Lactofen, a member of the diphenylether herbicides, has high activity
and is commonly used to control broadleaf weeds. As a post-emergent herbicide, it
is directly released to the environment, and easily caused the pollution. This
herbicide is degraded in soil mainly by microbial activity, but the functional
enzyme involved in the biodegradation of lactofen is still not clear now.
RESULTS: A novel esterase gene lacH, involved in the degradation of lactofen, was
cloned from the strain Brevundimonas sp. LY-2. The gene contained an open reading
frame of 921 bp, and a putative signal peptide at the N-terminal was identified
with the most likely cleavage site between Ala 28 and Ala 29. The encoded
protein, LacH, could catalyze the hydrolysis of lactofen to form acifluorfen.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that LacH belong to family V of bacterial lipolytic 
enzymes. Biochemical characterization analysis showed that LacH was a neutral
esterase with an optimal pH of 7.0 and an optimal temperature of 40 °C toward
lactofen. Besides, the activity of LacH was strongly inhibited by Hg2+ and Zn2+. 
LacH preferred short chain p-nitrophenyl esters (C2-C6), exhibited maximum
activity toward p-nitrophenyl acetate. Furthermore, the enantioselectivity of
LacH during lactofen hydrolysis was also studied, and the results show that
R-(-)-lactofen was degraded faster than S-(+)-lactofen, indicating the occurrence
of enantioselectivity in the enzymatic reaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Our studies characterized a novel esterase involved in the
biodegradation of diphenylether herbicide lactofen. The esterase showed
enantioselectivity during lactofen degradation, which revealed the occurrence of 
enzyme-mediated enantioselective degradation of chiral herbicides.
