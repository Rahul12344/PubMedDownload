Humoral immune responses to immunization and infection and susceptibilities to
antibody-mediated autoimmunity are generally lower in males1-3. However, the
mechanisms underlying such sexual dimorphism are not well understood. Here we
show that there are intrinsic differences between the B cells that produce
germinal centres in male and female mice. We find that antigen-activated male B
cells do not position themselves as efficiently as female B cells in the centre
of follicles in secondary lymphoid organs, in which germinal centres normally
develop. Moreover, GPR174-an X-chromosome-encoded G-protein-coupled
receptor-suppresses the formation of germinal centres in male, but not female,
mice. This effect is intrinsic to B cells, and correlates with the
GPR174-enhanced positioning of B cells towards the T-cell-B-cell border of
follicles, and the distraction of male, but not female, B cells from S1PR2-driven
follicle-centre localization. Biochemical fractionation of conditioned media that
induce B-cell migration in a GPR174-dependent manner identifies CCL21 as a GPR174
ligand. In response to CCL21, GPR174 triggers a calcium flux and preferentially
induces the migration of male B cells; GPR174 also becomes associated with more
Gαi protein in male than in female B cells. Male B cells from orchidectomized
mice exhibit impaired GPR174-mediated migration to CCL21, and testosterone
treatment rescues this defect. Female B cells from testosterone-treated mice
exhibit male-like GPR174-Gαi association and GPR174-mediated migration. Deleting 
GPR174 from male B cells causes more efficient positioning towards the follicular
centre, the formation of more germinal centres and an increased susceptibility to
B-cell-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. By identifying GPR174
as a receptor for CCL21 and demonstrating its sex-dependent control of B-cell
positioning and participation in germinal centres, we have revealed a mechanism
by which B-cell physiology is fine-tuned to impart sexual dimorphism to humoral
immunity.
