CD5 is expressed on T cells and a subset of B cells (B1a). It can attenuate TCR
signalling and impair CTL activation and is a therapeutic targetable tumour
antigen expressed on leukemic T and B cells. However, the potential therapeutic
effect of functionally blocking CD5 to increase T cell anti-tumour activity
against tumours (including solid tumours) has not been explored. CD5 knockout
mice show increased anti-tumour immunity: reducing CD5 on CTLs may be
therapeutically beneficial to enhance the anti-tumour response. Here, we show
that ex vivo administration of a function-blocking anti-CD5 MAb to primary mouse 
CTLs of both tumour-naïve mice and mice bearing murine 4T1 breast tumour
homografts enhanced their capacity to respond to activation by treatment with
anti-CD3/anti-CD28 MAbs or 4T1 tumour cell lysates. Furthermore, it enhanced TCR 
signalling (ERK activation) and increased markers of T cell activation, including
proliferation, CD69 levels, IFN-γ production, apoptosis and Fas receptor and Fas 
ligand levels. Finally, CD5 function-blocking MAb treatment enhanced the capacity
of CD8+ T cells to kill 4T1-mouse tumour cells in an ex vivo assay. These data
support the potential of blockade of CD5 function to enhance T cell-mediated
anti-tumour immunity.
