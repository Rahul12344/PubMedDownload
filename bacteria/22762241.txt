BACKGROUND: Bacterial growth in well-mixed culture is often assumed to be an
autonomous process only depending upon the external conditions under control of
the investigator. However, increasingly there is awareness that interactions
between cells in culture can lead to surprising phenomena such as
density-dependence in the initiation of growth.
RESULTS: Here I report the unexpected discovery of a density threshold for growth
of a strain of Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 used to inoculate eight replicate 
populations that were evolved in methanol. Six of these populations failed to
grow to the expected full density during the first couple transfers. Remarkably, 
the final cell number of six populations crashed to levels 60- to 400-fold
smaller than their cohorts. Five of these populations recovered to full density
soon after, but one population remained an order of magnitude smaller for over
one hundred generations. These variable dynamics appeared to be due to a density 
threshold for growth that was specific to both this particular ancestral strain
and to growth on methanol. When tested at full density, this population had
become less fit than its ancestor. Simply increasing the initial dilution 16-fold
reversed this result, revealing that this population had more than a 3-fold
advantage when tested at this lower density. As this population evolved and
ultimately recovered to the same final density range as the other populations
this low-density advantage waned.
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate surprisingly strong tradeoffs during
adaptation to growth at low absolute densities that manifest over just a 16-fold 
change in density. Capturing laboratory examples of transitions to and from
growth at low density may help us understand the physiological and evolutionary
forces that have led to the unusual properties of natural bacteria that have
specialized to low-density environments such as the open ocean.
