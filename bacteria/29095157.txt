The pteridine glycosyltransferase (PGT) found in Chlorobium tepidum (CtPGT)
catalyzes the conversion of L-threo-tetrahydrobiopterin to
1-O-(L-threo-biopterin-2'-yl)-β-N-acetylglucosamine using
UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The gene for CtPGT was cloned, and
selenomethionine-derivatized protein was overexpressed and purified using various
chromatographic techniques. The protein was crystallized by the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion method using 0.24 M triammonium citrate pH 7.0, 14%(w/v) PEG
3350 as a reservoir solution. Multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were
collected to 2.15 Å resolution from a single CtPGT crystal. The crystal belonged 
to the monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 189.61, b =
79.98, c = 105.92 Å, β = 120.5°.
