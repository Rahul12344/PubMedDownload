Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the agent of cold-water disease and rainbow trout
fry syndrome in salmonid fish worldwide. Ribosomal RNA gene restriction patterns 
(ribotypes) and plasmid profiles were determined on a collection of 85 strains
isolated from different countries and fish species. Several ribotypes were
obtained by using the restriction endonucleases Hinc II and Pvu II. Computer
analysis of the ribotypes revealed that some of them were clearly associated with
the fish species from which the strains were isolated, whereas no correlation
with the geographical origin was found. Most of the strains harboured at least
one plasmid and several different plasmid profiles were observed, even among
strains sharing the same ribotype. These methods, used alone or in combination
with other typing techniques, can be considered powerful tools for the
epidemiological tracing of F. psychrophilum infections.
