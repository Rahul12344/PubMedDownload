The prenyltransferase FtmPT1 from Aspergillus fumigatus is involved in the
biosynthesis of fumitremorgin-type alkaloids and catalysed the regular
C2-prenylation of brevianamide F (cyclo-L-Trp-L-Pro). It has been shown that
FtmPT1 also accepted a number of other tryptophan-containing cyclic dipeptides
and prenylated them, in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate, at C-2 of the 
indole nucleus. Detailed analysis of the incubation mixtures of FtmPT1 with these
cyclic dipeptides revealed the presence of additional product peaks in the HPLC
chromatograms. Seven regularly C3-prenylated hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-b]indoles were 
isolated and identified by HR-ESI-MS and NMR analyses including HMBC, HMQC and
NOESY experiments. Further experiments proved that the C2- and C3-prenylated
products are both independent enzyme products. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report on the enzymatic formation of regularly C3-prenylated
indolines. A reaction mechanism for both C2- and C3-prenylated derivatives was
proposed.
