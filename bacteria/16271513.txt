Memory T cells in human non-small cell lung cancer are unresponsive to
progressing tumors. T cells were evaluated at the single cell level by imaging
the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and NFAT via immunofluorescence confocal
microscopy as an early measure of responsiveness to T cell receptor triggering.
Little translocation of NF-kappaB or NFAT occurred in tumor-associated T cells in
response to CD3+CD28 cross-linking under conditions which led to maximal
translocation in normal donor peripheral blood T cells. TNF-alpha induced maximal
NF-kappaB translocation in these T cells, indicating that they remain receptive
to alternative signaling pathways, and pulsing with IL-12 prior to TCR triggering
reversed their apparent anergy. T cells from additional chronic inflammatory
microenvironments demonstrated a similar refractoriness to TCR activation,
suggesting either that a common regulatory mechanism present within the
microenvironment controls these cells or that with continuous antigen exposure,
they remain refractory to activation via the TCR.
