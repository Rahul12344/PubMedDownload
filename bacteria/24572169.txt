Musculoskeletal tuberculosis (TB) is a severe extrapulmonary manifestation of
chronic Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis infection. Considering increasing
incidence, multi-drug resistance and associated treatment difficulties, more
preclinical research is needed. In this study we developed a murine model for
musculoskeletal TB. Mice, intranasally infected with M. tuberculosis, were
sacrificed after ten months. Mycobacterial growth was detected in lung and femur 
homogenates. Ziehl-Neelsen staining of paraffin-embedded femurs showed acid-fast 
rods in the myelum and Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated osteomyelitis and 
macronodular tuberculomas. This new murine model of musculoskeletal TB might be
of value to further investigate immunologic and radiologic responses.
