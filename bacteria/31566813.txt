The use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with or without
chemotherapy to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) can result in
significant morbidity in light chain (AL) amyloidosis patients. Plerixafor, a
strong inducer and mobilizer of HPCs, can be used as an adjunct to G-CSF to
improve mobilization efficiency. We describe the outcomes for combined
G-CSF/plerixafor mobilized patients with AL amyloidosis. We reviewed data of 53
consecutive AL amyloidosis patients who underwent combined G-CSF/plerixafor HPC
mobilization between May 2011 and October 2017 at our institution. We evaluated
patients for HPC collection efficiency, perimobilization toxicity and
postautologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT) outcomes. Median
CD34+ cell collection was 12.4 × 106  cells/kg (range 2.5 × 106 to 34.1 × 106
 cells/kg) and 45 (85%) patients had collections of ≥5.0 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg.
There were no mobilization failures or perimobilization mortality. During
mobilization, 37 (70%) patients had weight gain (median 1.3 kg, range 0.1-4) but 
none >10% body weight, 5 (10%) patients had diarrhea, and one patient each had
hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia. Among the 31 patients analyzed for CD34
collection efficiency (CE), the median CD34 CE was 47% (range 36-62). At 5 years 
follow-up 82% and 84% of patients were progression-free and alive, respectively. 
Our results suggest that G-CSF/plerixafor mobilization is safe, well tolerated,
and effective in AL amyloidosis.
