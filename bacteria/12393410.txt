The signals that mediate T-cell infiltration during T-cell autoimmune diseases
are poorly understood. The chemokine CCL21 (originally isolated by us and others 
as Exodus-2/6Ckine/SLC/TCA4) is highly potent and highly specific for stimulating
T-cell migration. However, it is thought to be expressed only in secondary
lymphoid organs, directing naive T cells to areas of antigen presentation. It is 
not thought to play a role in T-cell effector function during a normal immune
response. In this study we tested the expression of T-cell chemokines and their
receptors during T-cell autoimmune infiltrative skin diseases. By using
immunohistology it was found that the expression of CCL21 but not CCL19 or 20 was
highly induced in endothelial cells of T-cell autoimmune diseases. The receptor
for CCL21, CCR7, was also found to be highly expressed on the infiltrating T
cells, most of which expressed the memory CD45Ro phenotype. These data imply that
the usual loss of CCL21 responsiveness in the normal development of memory T-cell
effector function does not hold for autoimmune skin diseases.
