This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Emdogain® (EMD)
against biofilms containing the periopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis. A
brain-Heart infusion broth inoculated with S. gordonii and P. gingivalis was
perfused (7-d, anaerobiosis) through a closed circuit containing two Robbins
devices as to form biofilms. The latter were then treated for 2 min with various 
antimicrobials (Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.2%, Povidone iodine (PVI) 5%, PVI 10%,
essential oils (EO), EO ZeroTM or EMD) (n=8) and cell densities were calculated
and compared. In the present in vitro model, Emdogain® was not statistically
effective (p>0.05) in killing biofilm bacteria unlike the other tested molecules.
