The attenuation of protein synthesis via the phosphorylation of eIF2α is a major 
stress response of all eukaryotic cells. The growth-arrest- and
DNA-damage-induced transcript 34 (GADD34) bound to the serine/threonine protein
phosphatase 1 (PP1) is the necessary eIF2α phosphatase complex that returns
mammalian cells to normal protein synthesis following stress. The molecular basis
by which GADD34 recruits PP1 and its substrate eIF2α are not fully understood,
hindering our understanding of the remarkable selectivity of the GADD34:PP1
phosphatase for eIF2α. Here, we report detailed structural and functional
analyses of the GADD34:PP1 holoenzyme and its recruitment of eIF2α. The data
highlight independent interactions of PP1 and eIF2α with GADD34, demonstrating
that GADD34 functions as a scaffold both in vitro and in cells. This work greatly
enhances our molecular understanding of a major cellular eIF2α phosphatase and
establishes the foundation for future translational work.
