KIR2DP1 is an inactive member of the human lineage III KIR family, which includes
all HLA-C-specific receptor genes. The lethal, and only, defect in KIR2DP1 is a
nucleotide deletion in codon 88. Fixed in modern humans, the deletion is also in 
archaic human genomes. KIR2DP1 is polymorphic, with dimorphism at
specificity-determining position 44. By repairing the deletion, we resurrected 11
alleles of KIR2DP1F , the functional antecedent of KIR2DP1 We demonstrate how
K44-KIR2DP1F with lysine 44 recognized C1+HLA-C, whereas T44-KIR2DP1F recognized 
C2+HLA-C. Dimorphisms at 12 other KIR2DP1F residues modulate receptor avidity or 
signaling. KIR2DP1 and KIR2DL1 are neighbors in the centromeric KIR region and
are in tight linkage disequilibrium. Like KIR2DL1, KIR2DP1 contributed to CenA
and CenB KIR haplotype differences. Encoded on CenA, C1-specific K44-KIR2DP1F
were stronger receptors than the attenuated C2-specific T44-KIR2DP1F encoded on
CenB The last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees had diverse lineage III
KIR that passed on to chimpanzees but not to humans. Early humans inherited
activating KIR2DS4 and an inhibitory lineage III KIR, likely encoding a
C1-specific receptor. The latter spawned the modern family of HLA-C receptors.
KIR2DP1F has properties consistent with KIR2DP1F having been the founder gene.
The first KIR2DP1F alleles encoded K44-C1 receptors; subsequently KIR2DP1F
alleles encoding T44-C2 receptors evolved. The emergence of dedicated KIR2DL2/3
and KIR2DL1 genes encoding C1 and C2 receptors, respectively, could have led to
obsolescence of KIR2DP1F Alternatively, pathogen subversion caused its demise.
Preservation of KIR2DP1F functional polymorphism was a side effect of fixation of
the deletion in KIR2DP1F by micro gene conversion.
