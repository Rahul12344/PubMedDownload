Despite recent advances in the development of novel therapies against
castration-resistant prostate cancer, the advanced form of the disease remains a 
major treatment challenge. Aberrant sphingolipid signaling through sphingosine
kinases and their product, sphingosine-1-phosphate, can promote proliferation,
drug resistance, angiogenesis, and inflammation. The sphingosine kinase 2
inhibitor ABC294640 is undergoing clinical testing in cancer patients, and in
this study we investigated the effects this first-in-class inhibitor in
castration-resistant prostate cancer. In vitro, ABC294640 decreased prostate
cancer cell viability as well as the expression of c-Myc and the androgen
receptor, while lysosomal acidification increased. ABC294640 also induced a
greater than 3-fold increase in dihydroceramides that inversely correlated with
inhibition of dihydroceramide desaturase (DEGS) activity. Expression of
sphingosine kinase 2 was dispensable for the ABC294640-mediated increase in
dihydroceramides. In vivo, ABC294640 diminished the growth rate of TRAMP-C2
xenografts in syngeneic hosts and elevated dihydroceramides within tumors as
visualized by MALDI imaging mass spectroscopy. The plasma of ABC294640-treated
mice contained significantly higher levels of C16- and C24:1-ceramides (but not
dihydro-C16-ceramide) compared with vehicle-treated mice. In summary, our results
suggest that ABC294640 may reduce the proliferative capacity of
castration-resistant prostate cancer cells through inhibition of both sphingosine
kinase 2 and dihydroceramide desaturase, thereby providing a foundation for
future exploration of this small-molecule inhibitor for the treatment of advanced
disease.
