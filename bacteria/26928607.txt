Granzymes are serine proteases involved in killing of tumor cells and virally
infected cells. However, granzymes are also upregulated in blood under
inflammatory conditions and contribute to cytokine release and processing. Here, 
we show that granzyme M (GrM) and to a lesser extent GrK are transiently elevated
in the circulation following LPS administration in humans. GrM is released upon
stimulation of whole blood with LPS or the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia
coli BL21, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Neisseria meningitidis. GrK is only
released upon stimulation with P. aeruginosa. Thus, GrM and GrK are
differentially released in response to LPS and gram-negative bacteria.
