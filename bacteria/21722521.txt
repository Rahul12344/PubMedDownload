AIM: To study the effects of CD74 gene on IFN-γR expression in myasthenia gravis 
thymic epithelial cell(TEC).
METHODS: PCMV-CD74 transiently transfect to primary cultured TEC mediated with
lipofectamine, the result of transfection and some autoimmune related genes such 
as IFN-γR were detected by real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR results show that the mRNA expression
level of IL-4R, IL-32, IFN-γR, ECGF1, HLA-A, HLA-DR increased significantly, with
the high express ion of CD74 gene in thymic epithelial cells.
CONCLUSION: CD74 gene over-expression in TEC can increase IFN-γR mRNA expression.
