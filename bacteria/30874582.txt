Peptidoglycan is a major component of the bacterial cell wall and thus a major
determinant of cell shape. Its biosynthesis is initiated by several sequential
reactions catalyzed by cytoplasmic Mur enzymes. Mur ligases (MurC, -D, -E, and
-F) are essential for bacteria, metabolize molecules not present in eukaryotes,
and are structurally and biochemically tractable. However, although many Mur
inhibitors have been developed, few have shown promising antibacterial activity, 
prompting the hypothesis that within the cytoplasm, Mur enzymes could exist as a 
complex whose architecture limits access of small molecules to their active
sites. This suggestion is supported by the observation that in many bacteria,
mur genes are present in a single operon, and pairs of these genes often are
fused to generate a single polypeptide. Here, we explored this genetic
arrangement in the human pathogen Bordetella pertussis and show that MurE and
MurF are expressed as a single, bifunctional protein. EM, small angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS), and analytical centrifugation (AUC) revealed that the
MurE-MurF fusion displays an elongated, flexible structure that can dimerize.
Moreover, MurE-MurF interacted with the peripheral glycosyltransferase MurG,
which formed discrete oligomers resembling 4- or 5-armed stars in EM images. The 
oligomeric structure of MurG may allow it to play a bona fide scaffolding role
for a potential Mur complex, facilitating the efficient conveyance of
peptidoglycan-building blocks toward the inner membrane leaflet. Our findings
shed light on the structural determinants of a peptidoglycan formation complex
involving Mur enzymes in bacterial cell wall formation.
