Halitosis, or bad breath, is a clinical problem for many people. In the majority 
of cases the problem has been shown to originate in the oral cavity. All
conditions that favour the retention of anaerobic, mainly gram-negative, bacteria
will predispose for the development of bad breath. In addition to periodontal
pockets, the most important retention site is the dorsum of the tongue with its
numerous papillae. The bacteria metabolize sulphur-containing amino acids to
yield the volatile sulphur-containing compounds hydrogen sulphide and
methylmercaptane. These substances have an offensive odour in very low
concentrations. The sulphur compounds may also damage the surrounding tissue
directly, and thereby contribute to the initiation and development of periodontal
disease. During the night and between meals the conditions are optimal for odour 
production. The importance of regular meals is therefore emphasized. To
supplement conventional oral hygienic measures the patients are advised to brush 
their tongue. The use of oral care products which contain metal ions, especially 
zinc, will inhibit odour formation because of the affinity of the metal ion to
sulphur. It is also possible to measure the level of volatile sulphur-containing 
compounds in the air in the mouth directly by means of a portable sulphide
monitor. Dentists and physicians are both advised to discuss the problem of
halitosis with their patients, since this should be regarded as an important
aspect of the patient's health.
