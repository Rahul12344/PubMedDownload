Binary toxins are produced by several pathogenic bacteria. Examples are the C2
toxin from Clostridium botulinum, the iota toxin from Clostridium perfringens,
and the CDT from Clostridium difficile. All these binary toxins have
ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRT) as their enzymatically active component that
modify monomeric actin in their target cells. The binary C2 toxin was intensively
described as a tool for intracellular delivery of allogenic ADPRTs. Here, we
firstly describe the binary toxin CDT from C. difficile as an effective tool for 
heterologous intracellular delivery. Even 60 kDa glucosyltransferase domains of
large clostridial glucosyltransferases can be delivered into cells. The
glucosyltransferase domains of five tested large clostridial glucosyltransferases
were successfully introduced into cells as chimeric fusions to the CDTa adapter
domain (CDTaN). Cell uptake was demonstrated by the analysis of cell morphology, 
cytoskeleton staining, and intracellular substrate glucosylation. The fusion
toxins were functional only when the adapter domain of CDTa was N-terminally
located, according to its native orientation. Thus, like other binary toxins, the
CDTaN/b system can be used for standardized delivery systems not only for
bacterial ADPRTs but also for a variety of bacterial glucosyltransferase domains.
