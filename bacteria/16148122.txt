After being positively selected on CD1d-expressing thymocytes, NKT cells undergo 
a series of developmental changes that can take place inside or outside the
thymus. We asked whether CD1d continues to play a role in late-stage NKT cell
development and, in particular, during the functionally significant acquisition
of NK1.1 that is indicative of NKT cell maturity. We report that CD1d is indeed
crucial for this step, because immature NK1.1(-) NKT cells fail to fully mature
when transferred to a CD1d-deficient environment. Surprisingly, however, the lack
of CD1d did not greatly affect the long-term survival of NKT cells, and they
continued to express CD69 and slowly proliferate. This directly contradicts the
currently held view that these phenomena are caused by autoreactivity directed
against CD1d/TCR-restricted self-Ags. Our findings demonstrate an ongoing role
for TCR-mediated signaling throughout NKT cell development, but the
characteristic semiactivated basal state of NKT cells is controlled by
CD1d-independent factors or is intrinsic to the cells themselves.
