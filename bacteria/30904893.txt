A 45-year-old male patient with Tourette syndrome presented to the emergency
department with worsening neck pain and stiffness of 1-week duration. Associated 
symptoms included headache, hoarse voice, trismus and odynophagia. The patient
was haemodynamically stable without fevers or leucocytosis. He exhibited cervical
spinal and paraspinal tenderness with very limited range of motion. Erythrocyte
sedimentation rate and C reactive protein were elevated, and blood cultures grew 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Lumbar puncture was
unremarkable. CT and MRI of the neck showed calcification of the longus colli,
fluid and capsular distention of C1-C2 joints, enhancement of the joint capsule
and retropharyngeal oedema suggestive of septic arthritis. Fluid was aspirated
from C1 to C2 joint by interventional radiology and showed calcium pyrophosphate 
crystals and heavy MRSA colonisation, consistent with both pseudogout and septic 
arthritis of the cervical vertebrae. The patient was started on a 6-week course
of daptomycin and showed gradual improvements in neck pain and mobility.
