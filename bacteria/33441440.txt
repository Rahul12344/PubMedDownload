HLA class I molecules that represent ligands for the inhibitory killer cell
Ig-like receptor (KIR) 3DL1 found on NK cells are categorically defined as those 
HLA-A and HLA-B allotypes containing the Bw4 motif, yet KIR3DL1 demonstrates
hierarchical recognition of these HLA-Bw4 ligands. To better understand the
molecular basis underpinning differential KIR3DL1 recognition, the HLA-ABw4
family of allotypes were investigated. Transfected human 721.221 cells expressing
HLA-A*32:01 strongly inhibited primary human KIR3DL1+ NK cells, whereas
HLA-A*24:02 and HLA-A*23:01 displayed intermediate potency and HLA-A*25:01 failed
to inhibit activation of KIR3DL1+ NK cells. Structural studies demonstrated that 
recognition of HLA-A*24:02 by KIR3DL1 used identical contacts as the potent
HLA-B*57:01 ligand. Namely, the D1-D2 domains of KIR3DL1 were placed over the α1 
helix and α2 helix of the HLA-A*24:02 binding cleft, respectively, whereas the D0
domain contacted the side of the HLA-A*24:02 molecule. Nevertheless, functional
analyses showed KIR3DL1 recognition of HLA-A*24:02 was more sensitive to
substitutions within the α2 helix of HLA-A*24:02, including residues Ile142 and
Lys144 Furthermore, the presence of Thr149 in the α2 helix of HLA-A*25:01
abrogated KIR3DL1+ NK inhibition. Together, these data demonstrate a role for the
HLA class I α2 helix in determining the hierarchy of KIR3DL1 ligands. Thus,
recognition of HLA class I is dependent on a complex interplay between the
peptide repertoire, polymorphisms within and proximal to the Bw4 motif, and the
α2 helix. Collectively, the data furthers our understanding of KIR3DL1 ligands
and will inform genetic association and immunogenetics studies examining the role
of KIR3DL1 in disease settings.
