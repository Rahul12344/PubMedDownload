Micronuclei are constantly considered as a marker of genome instability and very 
recently found to be a trigger of innate immune responses. An increased frequency
of micronuclei is associated with many diseases, but the mechanism underlying the
regulation of micronuclei homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we report
that CGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), a known regulator of DNA sensing and DNA
repair, reduces the abundance of micronuclei under genotoxic stress in an
autophagy-dependent manner. CGAS accumulates in the autophagic machinery and
directly interacts with MAP1LC3B/LC3B in a manner dependent upon its
MAP1LC3-interacting region (LIR). Importantly, the interaction is essential for
MAP1LC3 recruitment to micronuclei and subsequent clearance of micronuclei via
autophagy (micronucleophagy) in response to genotoxic stress. Moreover, in
contrast to its DNA sensing function to activate micronuclei-driven inflammation,
CGAS-mediated micronucleophagy blunts the production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)
induced by genotoxic stress. We therefore conclude that CGAS is a receptor for
the selective autophagic clearance of micronuclei and uncovered an unprecedented 
role of CGAS in micronuclei homeostasis to dampen innate immune surveillance.
