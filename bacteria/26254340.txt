Semi-invariant/type I NKT cells are a well-characterized CD1d-restricted T cell
subset. The availability of potent Ags and tetramers for semi-invariant/type I
NKT cells allowed this population to be extensively studied and revealed their
central roles in infection, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity. In contrast,
diverse/type II NKT (dNKT) cells are poorly understood because the lipid Ags that
they recognize are largely unknown. We sought to identify dNKT cell lipid Ag(s)
by interrogating a panel of dNKT mouse cell hybridomas with lipid extracts from
the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. We identified Listeria phosphatidylglycerol 
as a microbial Ag that was significantly more potent than a previously
characterized dNKT cell Ag, mammalian phosphatidylglycerol. Further, although
mammalian phosphatidylglycerol-loaded CD1d tetramers did not stain dNKT cells,
the Listeria-derived phosphatidylglycerol-loaded tetramers did. The structure of 
Listeria phosphatidylglycerol was distinct from mammalian phosphatidylglycerol
because it contained shorter, fully-saturated anteiso fatty acid lipid tails.
CD1d-binding lipid-displacement studies revealed that the microbial
phosphatidylglycerol Ag binds significantly better to CD1d than do counterparts
with the same headgroup. These data reveal a highly potent microbial lipid Ag for
a subset of dNKT cells and provide an explanation for its increased Ag potency
compared with the mammalian counterpart.
