The Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) is an ideal place for public health
interventions and provides ready access to the health care system, offering a
great opportunity for HIV testing and counselling. Between 2003 and 2005, rapid
test was requested for 59.39% of 10,752 cases from EMD, where as ELISA was
requested for 40.61%. Of the 317 HIV reactive cases, available medical records of
249 were reviewed for epidemiological and clinical information. Nearly 42% of
total reactive cases detected in our Institute were from EMD. Three percent
(317/10,752) were diagnosed as HIV reactive, 1.52% of the total samples were
reactive by rapid test and the other 1.43% by ELISA. Two and half percent
(163/6386) of those who had rapid testing and 3.53% (154/4366) who had ELISA
testing, were identified as HIV reactive. All these cases were diagnosed within a
mean EMD stay of 2.5 days. Eighty-five percent of HIV reactive individuals were
unaware of their reactive status. Additional 53 cases of asymptomatic spouses
were diagnosed as HIV reactive, thus making it possible to seek early treatment
for HIV infection. The study emphasizes the importance of offering HIV testing to
all patients who present to emergency department.
