BACKGROUND: Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plays a major role 
in the initiation and progression of chronic periodontitis. Human gingival
fibroblasts (HGFs) interact with bacteria or bacterial products and trigger
inflammatory signaling pathways that destroy periodontal tissues. RhoA regulates 
cytokine production in various cell types. This study investigated the role of
Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 in LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and
p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and inflammatory
cytokine production in HGFs.
METHODS: Effects of Y-27632, SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), and BAY11-7082 (NF-κB
inhibitor) were assessed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated HGFs. Cytotoxicity
assays were used to determine the effect of the drugs on HGF viability.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain
reaction were applied to evaluate the levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and
Toll-like receptors (TLRs). NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathway activation was detected by
western blot and immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: P. gingivalis LPS at 5 μg/mL, 10 μM Y-27632, 10 μM SB203580, and 5 μM
BAY11-7082 exhibited no toxicity in HGFs. LPS activated NF-κB and p38 MAPK by
increasing degradation of IκBα and phosphorylation of IκBα, p65, and p38, and
facilitating p65 translocation from the cytoplasm to nuclei. The activation of
NF-κB and p38 MAPK induced overproduction of IL-6 and IL-8 at both mRNA and
protein levels. However, Y-27632 attenuated LPS-induced NF-κB and p38 MAPK
activation and inflammatory cytokine production.
CONCLUSIONS: Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 downregulates LPS-induced IL-6 and IL-8
production by blocking NF-κB and p38 MAPK activation in HGFs.
