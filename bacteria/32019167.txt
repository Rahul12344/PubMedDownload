Milk kefir is a traditional fermented milk product whose consumption is becoming 
increasingly popular. The natural starter for kefir production is kefir grain,
which consists of various bacterial and yeast species. At the industrial scale,
however, kefir grains are rarely used due to their slow growth, complex
application, bad reproducibility and high costs. Instead, mixtures of defined
lactic acid bacteria and sometimes yeasts are applied, which alter sensory and
functional properties compared to natural grain-based milk kefir. In order to be 
able to mimic natural starter cultures for authentic kefir production, it is a
prerequisite to gain deep knowledge about the nature of kefir grains, its
microbial composition, morphologic structure, composition of strains on grains
and the impact of environmental parameters on kefir grain characteristics. In
addition, it is very important to deeply investigate the numerous
multi-dimensional interactions among different species, which play important
roles on the formation and the functionality of grains.
