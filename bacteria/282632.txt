Argininosuccinic aciduria: assignment of the argininosuccinate lyase gene to the 
pter to q22 region of human chromosome 7 by bioautography.

Naylor SL, Klebe RJ, Shows TB.

Argininosuccinic aciduria, an autosomal recessive disorder of the urea cycle in
humans, is associated with a deficiency of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL;
L-argininosuccinate arginine-lyase, EC 4.3.2.1). ASL activity was visualized on
gels after electrophoresis by a new method, termed bioautography. Bioautography
involves the use of mutant bacteria to visualize the location of mammalian
enzymes after zone electrophoresis. By this technique, human ASL migrated to a
position different from mouse ASL, while a survey of mouse strains, tissues, and 
tissue culture cell extracts demonstrated the same electrophoretic form and no
genetic variants of mouse ASL. Identifying human ASL, by bioautography in
human-mouse somatic cell hybrids has made it possible to regionally locate the
ASL gene on human chromosome 7. The human ASL phenotype segregated concordantly
with the human enzyme beta-glucoronidase (GUS; beta-D-glucoronide
glucuronosohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.31) in cell hybrids, but showed discordant
segregation with 32 other enzyme markers representing 23 linkage groups. The gene
for GUS has been assigned to chromosome 7 in humans, and cosegregation (synteny) 
of ASL and GUS demonstrates the assignment of ASL to chromosome 7. Regional
location of ASL and GUS to the pter to q22 region of chromosome 7 was achieved in
hybrids segregating a 7/9 translocation.
