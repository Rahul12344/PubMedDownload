Chemokines are important in the development and progression of tumors. We
investigated the expression of CXCL14 and CXCL16 in colon cancer. Expression of
mRNA was assessed in primary tumors and lymph nodes and CXCL16 mRNA levels were
correlated to patient's survival. Protein expression was investigated by
two-color immunofluorescence and immunomorphometry. CXCL14 and CXCL16 mRNA levels
and protein expression were significantly higher in colon cancer primary tumors
compared to apparently normal colon tissue. Positive cells were tumor cells, as
revealed by anti-CEA and anti-EpCAM staining. CXCL16, but not CXCL14, mRNA levels
were significantly higher in hematoxylin and eosin positive (H&E(+)) compared to 
H&E(-) colon cancer lymph nodes or control nodes (P < 0.0001). CXCL16 mRNA was
expressed in 5/5 colon cancer cell lines while CXCL14 was expressed significantly
in only one. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that colon cancer patients with lymph
nodes expressing high or very high levels (7.2 and 11.4 copies/18S rRNA unit,
respectively) of CXCL16 mRNA had a decreased mean survival time of 30 and 46
months at the 12-year follow-up (P = 0.04, P = 0.005, respectively). In
conclusion, high expression of CXCL16 mRNA in regional lymph nodes of colon
cancer patients is a sign of a poor prognosis.
