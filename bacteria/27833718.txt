Pseudomonas jessenii C2 and Pseudomonas jessenii H16 were isolated from low-Cu
and high-Cu industrially contaminated soil, respectively. P. jessenii H16
displayed significant resistance to copper when compared to P. jessenii C2. Here 
we describe genome sequences and interesting features of these two strains. The
genome of P. jessenii C2 comprised 6,420,113 bp, with 5814 protein-coding genes
and 67 RNA genes. P. jessenii H16 comprised 6,807,788 bp, with 5995
protein-coding genes and 70 RNA genes. Of special interest was a specific
adaptation to this harsh copper-contaminated environment as P. jessenii H16
contained a novel putative copper resistance genomic island (GI) of around
50,000 bp.
