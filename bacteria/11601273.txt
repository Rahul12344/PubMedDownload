OBJECTIVE: To construct and evaluate a recombinant multi-epitope, multistage
malaria vaccine candidate expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli).
METHODS: A hybrid gene (HGF) encoding several putative immunodominant T or T/B
epitopes from MSP-1, MSP-2, Pf155/RESA of Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum)
and two immune-stimulating epitopes from interleukin-1 and tetanus toxin was
synthesized. Two copies of HGF and a copy of gene encoding Pattaroyo's Spf66 were
connected together to construct a sandwich hybrid gene HGFSP. The gene was cloned
into an expression vector pWR450-I for production of a fusion protein with
beta-galactosidase. Efficacy of this vaccine candidate in inducing specific
immunity against malaria parasites was evaluated.
RESULTS: Immunization of different species of animals with purified recombinant
peptide showed that the peptide was able to induce remarkable antibody response
to the immunized peptide as well as falciparum malaria parasites. The epitopes
included in the construct could induce antibodies against the intact parasite
proteins as demonstrated by western blotting, indicating the epitopes retained
their antigenicity in the new peptide construct. Antibodies from animals
immunized with recombinant HGFSP peptide exhibited good ability in inhibition of 
the in vitro growth of malaria parasites, augmentation of phagocytosis of the
parasites or infected RBC by phagocytes, and facilitation of antibody dependent
cell mediated cytotoxicity to the cultured malaria parasites.
CONCLUSION: The recombinant peptide seems to be a potential candidate which is
valuable for further investigation.
