PURPOSE: The goals of this study were to investigate whether beta-defensins are
differentially expressed in the conjunctival epithelium of patients with moderate
dry eye when compared with normal subjects and whether proinflammatory cytokines 
or bacteria can modulate the expression of human beta-defensins (hBDs)-1, -2, and
-3 by conjunctival epithelial cells.
METHODS: RNA extracted from conjunctival impression cytology specimens of eight
normal subjects and nine patients with moderate dry eye was used in RT-PCR to
detect mRNA for hBDs-1, -2, and -3. Two conjunctival epithelial cell lines and
primary cultured conjunctival epithelial cells were treated with proinflammatory 
cytokines or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis
were used to detect mRNA for hBD-1, -2, and -3 and protein secretion of hBD-2,
respectively.
RESULTS: hBD-2 message was detected in RNA samples of eight of nine patients with
dry eye, but not in any of the normal subjects' samples, whereas hBD-1 and -3
were detected in all subjects tested. RT-PCR revealed an upregulation of hBD-2
but no difference in expression of hBD-1 and -3 in cultured conjunctival cells
after a 24-hour treatment with 10 ng/mL interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1beta and
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (10 ng/mL) or heat-killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1
million colony-forming units; n = 3). hBD-2 expression was upregulated from 4
hours of treatment with IL-1beta (at 10 ng/mL; (n = 2-3) and at a concentration
of 0.1 ng/mL IL-1beta (24-hour treatment; n = 2-3). Immunoblots demonstrated
protein secretion results corresponding to the RT-PCR data.
CONCLUSIONS: hBD-2 was expressed only in the conjunctival epithelium of patients 
with moderate dry eye. Because cytokines such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha induced
the expression of hBD-2 by conjunctival epithelial cells and because increased
proinflammatory cytokine activity is a feature of dry eye disease, it can be
speculated that the hBD-2 upregulation observed in subjects with moderate dry eye
is mediated by proinflammatory cytokine activity.
