Cancer-associated point mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and
IDH2) confer a neomorphic enzymatic activity: the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to
d-2-hydroxyglutaric acid, which is proposed to act as an oncogenic metabolite by 
inducing hypermethylation of histones and DNA. Although selective inhibitors of
mutant IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified and are currently under investigation
as potential cancer therapeutics, the mechanistic basis for their selectivity is 
not yet well understood. A high throughput screen for selective inhibitors of
IDH1 bearing the oncogenic mutation R132H identified compound 1, a bis-imidazole 
phenol that inhibits d-2-hydroxyglutaric acid production in cells. We
investigated the mode of inhibition of compound 1 and a previously published IDH1
mutant inhibitor with a different chemical scaffold. Steady-state kinetics and
biophysical studies show that both of these compounds selectively inhibit mutant 
IDH1 by binding to an allosteric site and that inhibition is competitive with
respect to Mg(2+). A crystal structure of compound 1 complexed with R132H IDH1
indicates that the inhibitor binds at the dimer interface and makes direct
contact with a residue involved in binding of the catalytically essential
divalent cation. These results show that targeting a divalent cation binding
residue can enable selective inhibition of mutant IDH1 and suggest that
differences in magnesium binding between wild-type and mutant enzymes may
contribute to the inhibitors' selectivity for the mutant enzyme.
