Intense femtosecond x-ray pulses produced at the Linac Coherent Light Source
(LCLS) were used for simultaneous x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray emission
spectroscopy (XES) of microcrystals of photosystem II (PS II) at room
temperature. This method probes the overall protein structure and the electronic 
structure of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the oxygen-evolving complex of PS II. XRD
data are presented from both the dark state (S1) and the first illuminated state 
(S2) of PS II. Our simultaneous XRD-XES study shows that the PS II crystals are
intact during our measurements at the LCLS, not only with respect to the
structure of PS II, but also with regard to the electronic structure of the
highly radiation-sensitive Mn4CaO5 cluster, opening new directions for future
dynamics studies.
