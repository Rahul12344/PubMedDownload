Although the niche differentiation of anammox bacteria has been extensively
observed in a lab-scale reactor, the inherent mechanism for this ecological
phenomenon is still elusive. Here, we combined the long-term reactor operation,
genome-centered metagenome, and metatranscriptome analyses to gain insight into
the substrate competition and niche differentiation of Candidatus Jettenia and
Candidatus Brocadia. After 146 days of operation, we found the anammox bacterial 
population shifted from Ca. Jettenia to Ca. Brocadia in the
immobilization-anaerobic baffled reactor (I-ABR) with the ammonium and nitrite
concentrations of 30 mg/L. Importantly, the genome and transcript comparisons of 
Ca. Jettenia and Ca. Brocadia showed that Ca. Brocadia harbored more complete
function in cell chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, and two-component system and
more redundant function in nitrite reduction, in which the genes were also highly
expressed. Ca. Brocadia out-competed Ca. Jettenia at the mainstream condition.
Meanwhile, though the highest biomass concentration led to the highest nitrogen
removal rate (NRR) in the first compartment (C1), the competition of Ca. Jettenia
and Ca. Brocadia could also affect the NRR of different compartments through
affecting the bacterial activity. Substrate competition of anammox bacteria led
to higher transcript activity of Ca. Jettenia and Ca. Brocadia in the second (C2)
and fourth (C4) compartments, respectively. Further, high transcript activity of 
Ca. Brocadia led to the higher NRR in C4. A comparison of metabolic potential
based on the metagenome-assembled genome adds a different dimension for
understanding the discrepantly physiological characteristics and competition of
anammox bacteria for wastewater treatment.
