The discovery of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in U.S. swine
production is troubling and underscores a tumultuous period where the outlook on 
the battle against superbugs is bleak. However, all is not lost. This commentary 
highlights both the good and the bad that can come from such findings, including 
those of a recent study published by Mollenkopf et al. (Antimicrob Agents
Chemother 61:e012198-16, 2017, https://doi.org/doi:10.1128/AAC.01298-16).
