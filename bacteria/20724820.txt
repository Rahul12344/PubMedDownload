Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is characterized by a chromosomal t(15;17)
translocation that fuses the gene encoding the promyelocytic leukemia protein
(PML) to that encoding retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA). The product of this
genetic aberration, the PML/RARA fusion protein, is highly oncogenic and supports
malignant transformation and growth of hematopoietic precursor cells at the
promyelocytic stage of differentiation. Successful treatment of APL by all-trans 
retinoic acid (ATRA) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) depends on the ability of these
drugs to induce proteolytic degradation of this chimeric protein. In a recently
published study we demonstrate that PML/RARA is amenable for degradation by
autophagy and that ATRA- and ATO-induced PML/RARA degradation is
autophagy-dependent. Consequently, autophagic degradation regulates basal
turnover as well as therapy-induced elimination of this oncoprotein. In addition,
our study reveals an important role of autophagy in promoting granulocytic
differentiation of APL cells.
