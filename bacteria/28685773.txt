The interaction between tumor and the immune system is still poorly understood.
Significant clinical responses have been achieved in cancer patients treated with
antibodies against the CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoints; however, only a small
portion of patients responded to the therapies, indicating a need to explore
additional co-inhibitory molecules for cancer treatment. B7-H3, a member of the
B7 superfamily, was previously shown by us to inhibit T-cell activation and
autoimmunity. In this study, we have analyzed the function of B7-H3 in tumor
immunity. Expression of B7-H3 was found in multiple tumor lines,
tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells, and macrophages. B7-H3-deficient mice or mice
treated with an antagonistic antibody to B7-H3 showed reduced growth of multiple 
tumors, which depended on NK and CD8+ T cells. With a putative receptor expressed
by cytotoxic lymphocytes, B7-H3 inhibited their activation, and its deficiency
resulted in increased cytotoxic lymphocyte function in tumor-bearing mice.
Combining blockades of B7-H3 and PD-1 resulted in further enhanced therapeutic
control of late-stage tumors. Taken together, our results indicate that the B7-H3
checkpoint may serve as a novel target for immunotherapy against cancer.
