Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) has emerged and is increasing
worldwide. In a 2011 outbreak of MRMP infections in Japan, symptoms failed to
improve in many patients who initially received macrolides; the therapeutic agent
was then changed to minocycline (MIN), doxycycline (DOX) or tosufloxacin (TFX).
In this study, the bactericidal effects of these three agents against MRMP were
evaluated. Time-kill kinetics against MRMP and macrolide-susceptible M.
pneumoniae (MSMP) were determined for 5 days at concentrations corresponding to
the respective minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and 2 × MIC, i.e. 1 µg/mL
and 2 µg/mL for MIN, 0.5 µg/mL and 1 µg/mL for DOX, and 0.5 µg/mL and 1 µg/mL for
TFX. The post-antibiotic effects (PAE) of these agents in culture against MRMP
were also examined based on their pharmacokinetic parameters in children.
Following exposure of MRMP and MSMP to up to twice the respective MICs of MIN,
DOX and TFX, viable cells initially numbering 106 CFU/mL had decreased similarly 
to 103 CFU/mL after 4 days. Clarithromycin and azithromycin showed good
bactericidal action against MSMP but not against MRMP. PAEs against MRMP appeared
superior with MIN and DOX compared with TFX. In infection with M. pneumoniae
having a generation time exceeding 6 h, a therapeutic agent must be selected in
consideration of pharmacokinetic parameters, not MICs alone.
