This study aimed at examining whether oral administration of
galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) and Bifidobacterium longum, individually or in
combination, could exert photoprotective effects on the skin of hairless mice.
GOS and/or Bifidobacterium were administered orally to hairless mice for 12
weeks. Mice were irradiated with UV light daily for four consecutive days. GOS
administration increased the water-holding capacity of the skin and prevented
transepidermal water loss compared with the control. A reduction in the erythema 
formation of 16.8% was also observed in the GOS-treated group compared with the
control, and CD44 gene expression was significantly increased. Oral
administration of GOS or Bifidobacterium significantly increased TIMP-1 and Col1 
mRNA expression compared with the control. Our findings support that prebiotics, 
including GOS, are beneficial not only to the intestine, but also to the skin,
and present the possibility of new nutritional strategies for the prevention of
UV-induced skin damage.
