A 67-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of watery diarrhea and
pre-shock status at 10:30 am on March 20, 1995. He had travelled to Bali Island
in Indonesia from March 13 to March 18, 1995. On admission, his systolic blood
pressure was 60 mmHg and body temperature was 35.2 degrees C. His skin was very
dry. Laboratory tests showed that s-Cr was 6.3 mg/dl and CPK was 5620 IU/l. A
massive fluid transfusion was given immediately and then his blood pressure rose 
to 158/92 about two hours after admission. However, he developed a high grade
fever and systemic cyanosis in the evening of the first hospital day and died at 
0:20 am on March 21st. Salmonella Weltevreden was detected in the fecal and blood
cultures obtained on admission. We considered that his acute renal failure was
attributable to rhabdomyolysis due to dehydration and that the cause of death was
probably septic shock. The patient had a previous history of cholecystectomy ten 
years ago and also suffered from hypertension, but his general condition was not 
so bad before this episode. Therefore, we were surprised that his illness became 
so severe. This case emphasizes that Salmonella enteritis may occasionally be a
serious and lethal disease.
