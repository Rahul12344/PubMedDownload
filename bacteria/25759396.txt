Prostate cancer (PCa) progression is regulated by the androgen receptor (AR);
however, patients undergoing androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for disseminated 
PCa eventually develop castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Results of previous
studies indicated that AR, a transcription factor, occupies distinct genomic loci
in CRPC compared with hormone-naïve PCa; however, the cause of this distinction
was unknown. The E3 ubiquitin ligase Nrdp1 is a model AR target modulated by
androgens in hormone-naïve PCa but not in CRPC. Using Nrdp1, we investigated how 
AR switches transcription programs during CRPC progression. The proximal Nrdp1
promoter contains an androgen response element (ARE); we demonstrated AR binding 
to this ARE in androgen-sensitive PCa. Analysis of hormone-naive human
prostatectomy specimens revealed correlation between Nrdp1 and AR expression,
supporting AR regulation of NRDP1 levels in androgen-sensitive tissue. However,
despite sustained AR levels, AR binding to the Nrdp1 promoter and Nrdp1
expression were suppressed in CRPC. Elucidation of the suppression mechanism
demonstrated correlation of NRDP1 levels with nuclear localization of the
scaffolding protein filamin A (FLNA) which, as we previously showed, is itself
repressed following ADT in many CRPC tumors. Restoration of nuclear FLNA in CRPC 
stimulated AR binding to Nrdp1 ARE, increased its transcription, and augmented
NRDP1 protein expression and responsiveness to ADT, indicating that nuclear FLNA 
controls AR-mediated androgen-sensitive Nrdp1 transcription. Expression of other 
AR-regulated genes lost in CRPC was also re-established by nuclear FLNA. Thus,
our results indicate that nuclear FLNA promotes androgen-dependent AR-regulated
transcription in PCa, while loss of nuclear FLNA in CRPC alters the AR-regulated 
transcription program.
