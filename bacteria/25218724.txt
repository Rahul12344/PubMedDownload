Even though Arcobacter butzleri has been implicated in some human disease as
diarrhoea and bacteraemia, much of its pathogenesis and virulence factors remain 
unclear. In this work we have compared pathogenic and genotypic properties of six
A. butzleri isolates from human and non-human sources. The tested isolates showed
to be susceptible to tetracyclines and aminoglycosides, however non-human
isolates were all resistant to quinolones. The ability to form biofilms was
variable among the tested strains, and all of them showed a weak haemolytic
activity. The presence of nine putative virulence genes was determined, with
cadF, ciaB, cj1349, mviN, pldA, tlyA being detected in all strains, while irgA
(3/6), hecA (5/6), hecB (4/6) were detected only in some strains. High levels of 
adhesion were observed for A. butzleri on Caco-2 cells, with pre-existing
inflammation showing no significant effect on the adherence ability; yet variable
levels of invasion were observed. A. butzleri isolates were able to survive
intracellularly in Caco-2 cells and to induce a significant up-regulation of
interleukin-8 secretion and structural cell rearrangements. These data brings new
insights on A. butzleri virulence and highlights its pathogenic potential.
