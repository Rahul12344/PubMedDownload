Anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) binds to its cellular receptor, and seven
subunits self-associate to form a heptameric ring that mediates the cytoplasmic
entry of lethal factor or edema factor. The influence of receptor type on
susceptibility to anthrax toxin components was examined using Chinese hamster
ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human form of one of two PA receptors: TEM8 or
CMG2. Unexpectedly, PA alone, previously believed to only mediate entry of lethal
factor or edema factor, was found to be toxic to CHO-TEM8 cells; cells treated
with PA alone displayed reduced cell growth and decreased metabolic activity.
PA-treated cells swelled and became permeable to membrane-excluded dye,
suggesting that PA formed cell surface pores on CHO-TEM8 cells. While CHO-CMG2
cells were not killed by wild-type PA, they were susceptible to the PA variant,
F427A. Receptor expression also conferred differences in susceptibility to edema 
factor.
