The multifunctional cytokine TGF-β crucially participates in breast cancer (BCa) 
metastasis and works differently in the disease stages, thus contributing in BCa 
progression. We address connections between TGF-β and the stem cell-related
transcription factor (TF) Oct4 in BCa. In 147 BCa patients with infiltrating duct
carcinoma, we identified a significantly higher number of cases with both
moderate/high Oct4 expression and high TGF-β in late stages compared to early
stages of the disease. In vitro studies showed that TGF-β elevated Oct4
expression, which in turn, regulated Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition
(EMT)-regulatory gene (Snail and Slug) expression, migratory ability, chemotactic
invasiveness and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation potential of BCa cells.
Putative binding sites for Oct4 on the snail, slug and cxcl13 promoters and for
Smad3 on the snail and slug promoters were identified. Promoter activities of
snail and slug were greater in dual-treated cells than only TGF-β-treated or
Oct4-overexpressing cells. CXCL13 mRNA fold changes, however, were low in cells
induced with TGF-β, compared to dual-treated or Oct4-overexpressing cells. Our
co-IP studies confirmed that Oct4 and Smad3 form heterodimers that recognize
specific promoter sequences to promote Snail and Slug expression, but which in
turn, indirectly inhibits Smad3-mediated repression of CXCL13 expression,
allowing Oct4 to act as a positive TF for CXCL13. Taken together, these data
suggest that TGF-β signaling and Oct4 cooperate to induce expression of
EMT-related genes Snail, Slug and CXCL13, which accelerates disease progression, 
particularly in the late stages, and may indicate a poor prognosis for BCa
patients.
