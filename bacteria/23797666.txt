CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells boost humoral immunity to T-dependent 
Ags that are coadministered with the CD1d-binding glycolipid Ag
α-galactosylceramide (α-GC). Observations that mice lacking iNKT cells have
decaying Ab responses following vaccination have led to the hypothesis that iNKT 
cells express plasma cell (PC) survival factors that sustain specific Ab titers. 
Bone marrow chimeric mice in which the entire hematopoietic compartment or iNKT
cells selectively lacked BAFF, a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), or both
BAFF and APRIL were created and immunized with nitrophenol hapten-conjugated
keyhole limpet hemocyanin adsorbed to Imject aluminum hydroxide-containing
adjuvant or mixed with α-GC. In comparison with BAFF- or APRIL-sufficient bone
marrow chimeras, absence of hematopoietic compartment- and iNKT-derived BAFF and 
APRIL was associated with rapidly decaying Ab titers and reduced PC numbers. The 
iNKT cell-derived BAFF or APRIL assumed a greater role in PC survival when α-GC
was used as the adjuvant for immunization. These results show that iNKT
cell-derived BAFF and APRIL each contribute to survival of PCs induced by
immunization. This study sheds new light on the mechanisms through which iNKT
cells impact humoral immunity and may inform design of vaccines that incorporate 
glycolipid adjuvants.
