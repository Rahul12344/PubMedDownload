The adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) from Escherichia coli belongs 
to the group of autotransporters, specifically the type Va secretion system
(T5aSS). All autotransporter systems contain a C-terminal β-domain, which forms a
barrel-like structure in the outer membrane with a hydrophilic pore allowing
passenger translocation across the outer membrane. The passenger domain harbours 
the biological activity in the extracellular space and functions, for example, as
an adhesin, an enzyme and a toxin. The exact transport mechanism of passenger
translocation across the outer membrane is not clear at present. Thus, structure 
determination of the transport unit of AIDA-I could provide new insights into the
transport mechanism. Here, the purification, crystallization and preliminary
X-ray crystallographic studies of the transport unit of AIDA-I are reported.
