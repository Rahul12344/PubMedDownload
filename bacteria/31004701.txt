Liver-intestine cadherin (CDH17) has been known to function as a tumor stimulator
and diagnostic marker for almost two decades. However, its function in highly
malignant pancreatic cancer (PC) has yet to be elucidated. Using different
strategies including siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR technology, we successfully induced
knockdown and knockout of CDH17 in Panc02-H7 cells and established the
corresponding stable cell lines. With these cells, we demonstrated that loss of
CDH17 function not only suppressed Panc02-H7 cell growth in vitro but also
significantly slowed orthotopic tumor growth in vivo, resulting in the
significant life extension. In vitro studies demonstrated that impairing CDH17
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and motility by mechanistically
modulating pro- and anti-apoptosis events in PC cells, as CDH17 suppression
obviously increased expression of Bad, cytochrome C, cleaved caspase 3, and
cleaved PARP, and reduced expression of Bcl-2, Survivin, and pAkt. In vivo
studies showed CDH17 knockout resulted in apoptotic PC tumor death through
activating caspase-3 activity. Taken together, CDH17 functions as an oncogenic
molecule critical to PC growth by regulating tumor apoptosis signaling pathways
and CDH17 could be targeted to develop an anti-PC therapeutic approach.
