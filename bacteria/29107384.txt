Leptospirosis is an important zoonosis of global importance caused by bacteria
Leptospira spp. Pathogenic Leptospira is resistant to Complement System killing
while non-pathogenic Leptospira is rapidly killed by exposure to normal human
serum (NHS). Pathogenic Leptospira interact with Complement Regulators such as
Factor H, C4b binding protein and Vitronectin avoiding Complement activation and 
killing by Alternative and Classical Pathways. One important regulator is
C1-inhibitor (C1INH) that interacts with C1s or MASPs controlling the cleavage of
C4 and C2 molecules, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Classical and
Lectin Pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that attenuated, saprophytic and
pathogenic Leptospira interact with C1INH that maintain its regulatory capacity
of interaction with C1s preventing the activation of Complement system. Although 
the interaction with C1INH is not crucial for pathogenic Leptospira survival, it 
seems to be important for the survival of attenuated and saprophytic Leptospira
in normal human serum.
