Microbes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are often challenged by rapidly changing 
nutritional environments. In order to adapt to these shifts in nutrient
availability, bacteria exert tight transcriptional control over the enzymes of
central metabolism. This transcriptional control is orchestrated by a series of
transcriptional repressors and activators. Although a number of these
transcription factors have been identified, many others remain uncharacterized.
Here, we present a simple pipeline to uncover and validate the targets of
uncharacterized transcriptional regulators in P. aeruginosa. We use this approach
to identify and confirm that an orthologue of the Pseudomonas fluorescens
transcriptional regulator (RccR) binds to the upstream region of isocitrate lyase
(aceA) in P. aeruginosa, thereby repressing flux through the glyoxylate shunt
during growth on non-C2 carbon sources.
