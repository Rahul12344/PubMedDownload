Mycobacterium tuberculosis' success as a pathogen comes from its ability to evade
degradation by macrophages. Normally macrophages clear microorganisms that
activate pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs) through a lysosomal-trafficking
pathway called "LC3-associated phagocytosis" (LAP). Although Mtuberculosis
activates numerous PRRs, for reasons that are poorly understood LAP does not
substantially contribute to Mtuberculosis control. LAP depends upon reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generated by NADPH oxidase, but Mtuberculosis fails to
generate a robust oxidative response. Here, we show that CpsA, a LytR-CpsA-Psr
(LCP) domain-containing protein, is required for Mtuberculosis to evade killing
by NADPH oxidase and LAP. Unlike phagosomes containing wild-type bacilli,
phagosomes containing the ΔcpsA mutant recruited NADPH oxidase, produced ROS,
associated with LC3, and matured into antibacterial lysosomes. Moreover, CpsA was
sufficient to impair NADPH oxidase recruitment to fungal particles that are
normally cleared by LAP. Intracellular survival of the ΔcpsA mutant was largely
restored in macrophages missing LAP components (Nox2, Rubicon, Beclin, Atg5,
Atg7, or Atg16L1) but not in macrophages defective in a related, canonical
autophagy pathway (Atg14, Ulk1, or cGAS). The ΔcpsA mutant was highly impaired in
vivo, and its growth was partially restored in mice deficient in NADPH oxidase,
Atg5, or Atg7, demonstrating that CpsA makes a significant contribution to the
resistance of Mtuberculosis to NADPH oxidase and LC3 trafficking in vivo.
Overall, our findings reveal an essential role of CpsA in innate immune evasion
and suggest that LCP proteins have functions beyond their previously known role
in cell-wall metabolism.
