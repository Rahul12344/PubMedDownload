BACKGROUND: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is an insidious chronic fibrotic
condition that involves the oral mucosa and occasionally the pharynx and
esophagus. Vascularity in OSMF has always been a matter of debate. The prevailing
concept is that epithelial atrophy occurs due to lack of perfusion but the recent
data challenges this concept. Therefore, the present study was conducted to
evaluate the immunoreactivity of CD34 and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)
in different histological grades of OSMF. This might further shed light to the
role of microvasculature in OSMF, so that the epithelial atrophy and resultant
malignant transformation seen in the advanced stages might be elucidated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 30 cases of OSMF were included in the study and
mean vascular density (MVD) was calculated using CD34 and bFGF. Five cases of
OSMF with dysplasia and 2 cases of OSMF turning malignant were added during the
course of the study.
RESULTS: Mean vascular density was found to decrease significantly as the
diseases advanced. Furthermore, vascularity increased significantly in cases of
OSMF turning towards malignancy.
CONCLUSION: Our study supports the concept of epithelial atrophy aftermath of
lack of perfusion. There is reduced vascularity as the disease advances and this 
denies the systemic absorption of carcinogens, which affects the already
compromised epithelium. Consequently, liberation of angiogenic factors occurs
because of malignant transformation, which explains the neoangiogenesis and
increased vascularity in OSMF turning towards malignancy. Further studies are
required to identify the mechanism leading to carcinogenesis in the atrophied
epithelium aftermath of fibrosis and decreased vascularity.
