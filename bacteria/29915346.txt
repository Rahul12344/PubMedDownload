The human DNA repair enzyme MUTYH excises mispaired adenine residues in oxidized 
DNA. Homozygous MUTYH mutations underlie the autosomal, recessive cancer syndrome
MUTYH-associated polyposis. We report a MUTYH variant, p.C306W (c.918C>G), with a
tryptophan residue in place of native cysteine, that ligates the [4Fe4S] cluster 
in a patient with colonic polyposis and family history of early age colon cancer.
In bacterial MutY, the [4Fe4S] cluster is redox active, allowing rapid
localization to target lesions by long-range, DNA-mediated signalling. In the
current study, using DNA electrochemistry, we determine that wild-type MUTYH is
similarly redox-active, but MUTYH C306W undergoes rapid oxidative degradation of 
its cluster to [3Fe4S]+, with loss of redox signalling. In MUTYH C306W, oxidative
cluster degradation leads to decreased DNA binding and enzyme function. This
study confirms redox activity in eukaryotic DNA repair proteins and establishes
MUTYH C306W as a pathogenic variant, highlighting the essential role of redox
signalling by the [4Fe4S] cluster.
