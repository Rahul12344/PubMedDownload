Climate change and human pressures are changing the global distribution and the
extent of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), which comprise half
of the global river network area. IRES are characterized by periods of flow
cessation, during which channel substrates accumulate and undergo
physico-chemical changes (preconditioning), and periods of flow resumption, when 
these substrates are rewetted and release pulses of dissolved nutrients and
organic matter (OM). However, there are no estimates of the amounts and quality
of leached substances, nor is there information on the underlying environmental
constraints operating at the global scale. We experimentally simulated, under
standard laboratory conditions, rewetting of leaves, riverbed sediments, and
epilithic biofilms collected during the dry phase across 205 IRES from five major
climate zones. We determined the amounts and qualitative characteristics of the
leached nutrients and OM, and estimated their areal fluxes from riverbeds. In
addition, we evaluated the variance in leachate characteristics in relation to
selected environmental variables and substrate characteristics. We found that
sediments, due to their large quantities within riverbeds, contribute most to the
overall flux of dissolved substances during rewetting events (56%-98%), and that 
flux rates distinctly differ among climate zones. Dissolved organic carbon,
phenolics, and nitrate contributed most to the areal fluxes. The largest amounts 
of leached substances were found in the continental climate zone, coinciding with
the lowest potential bioavailability of the leached OM. The opposite pattern was 
found in the arid zone. Environmental variables expected to be modified under
climate change (i.e. potential evapotranspiration, aridity, dry period duration, 
land use) were correlated with the amount of leached substances, with the
strongest relationship found for sediments. These results show that the role of
IRES should be accounted for in global biogeochemical cycles, especially because 
prevalence of IRES will increase due to increasing severity of drying events.
