Phagocytosis is indispensable for the pathogenesis of the intestinal protozoan
parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Here, we showed that in E. histolytica Rab8A,
which is generally involved in trafficking from the trans-Golgi network to the
plasma membrane in other organisms but was previously identified in phagosomes of
the amoeba in the proteomic analysis, primarily resides in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) and participates in phagocytosis. We demonstrated that
down-regulation of EhRab8A by small antisense RNA-mediated transcriptional gene
silencing remarkably reduced adherence and phagocytosis of erythrocytes, bacteria
and carboxylated latex beads. Surface biotinylation followed by SDS-PAGE analysis
revealed that the surface expression of several proteins presumably involved in
target recognition was reduced in the EhRab8A gene-silenced strain. Further,
overexpression of wild-type EhRab8A augmented phagocytosis, whereas expression of
the dominant-negative form of EhRab8A resulted in reduced phagocytosis. These
results indicated that EhRab8A regulates transport of surface receptor(s) for the
prey from the ER to the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, this is the first
report that the ER-resident Rab GTPase is involved in phagocytosis through the
regulation of trafficking of a surface receptor, supporting a premise of direct
involvement of the ER in phagocytosis.
