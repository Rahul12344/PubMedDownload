Differences in susceptibility to infection with Treponema pallidum (Nichols)
between five strains of guinea pig.

Wicher K, Wicher V, Gruhn RF.

Groups of 10 young male guinea pigs of inbred strains 2 and 13 and outbred
strains Hartley A, Hartley B, and one deficient in the fourth component of
complement (C4D) were infected intradermally with 80 X 10(6) Treponema pallidum
(Nichols). The course of infection and production of antitreponemal antibody were
examined. Strain C4D guinea pigs were the most susceptible to infection (100%);
inbred strains 2 and 13 and outbred strain Hartley B showed 80-90% symptomatic
infection; and the Hartley A strain was the least susceptible to infection (10%).
Strain 13 animals responded with the highest antitreponemal antibody activity,
and the Hartley A strain with the lowest. The results suggest that genetic
factors or complement, or both, may influence the degree of susceptibility to
infection with T pallidum in guinea pigs.
