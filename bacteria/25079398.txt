BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to determine whether baseline salivary
inflammatory biomarkers could discriminate between different clinical levels of
disease and/or detect clinical changes over a 3-week stent-induced biofilm
overgrowth (SIBO) period.
METHODS: A total of 168 participants were enrolled in a 21-day experimental
gingivitis investigation and grouped according to clinical measures of
periodontal status of health and diseased individuals representing each of five
biofilm gingival interface (BGI) periodontal groups: 1) health, all probing depth
(PD) <3 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) <10%; 2) gingivitis, all PD <3 mm and
BOP ≥10%; 3) periodontitis (P)1, ≥1 site with PD >3 mm and BOP ≤10%; 4) P2, ≥1
site with PD >3 mm and BOP >10% but ≤50%; and 5) P3, ≥1 site with PD >3 mm and
BOP >50%. Stents were used to prevent plaque removal during brushing over one
maxillary and one mandibular posterior dental sextant for 21 days. Clinical
periodontal parameters and unstimulated saliva were collected at screening,
baseline, and each week during SIBO. Saliva samples were assessed for levels of
13 different biomarkers by multiplex immunoassay.
RESULTS: Higher salivary levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, matrix metalloproteinase 
(MMP)-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were
found in diseased groups compared with the healthy group at baseline. Conversely,
higher IL-1 receptor antagonist (ra) levels were found in healthy patients at
baseline. In addition, during SIBO, MMP-1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 
(TIMP)-1, and TIMP-2 levels increased across all participant groups. A stepwise
linear regression model using all salivary biomarkers demonstrated that, at
baseline, increased IL-1ra (P = 0.004) and IL-6 (P = 0.009) were significantly
associated with change in PDs during SIBO.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this investigation supports salivary levels of IL-1ra
and IL-6 as potential indicators for PD changes during induced gingival
inflammation. In addition, participants from the BGI-P3 group (severe
periodontitis) demonstrated elevated baseline levels of IL-1β, MMP-3, MMP-8,
MMP-9, and NGAL compared with the other study groups, strengthening the relevance
of participants' biologic phenotype on expression of salivary biomarkers.
