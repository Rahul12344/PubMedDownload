The quality and safety of ginseng products were seriously affected due to the
slow metabolism and long-term residual pesticides in ginseng. Microbial
degradation is an effective method to degrade pesticide residues. In this study, 
ginseng endophytic Paenibacillus polymyxa was used to degrade pesticide residues.
A method of simultaneous determination of fluazinam, BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos and 
DDT in ginseng roots and ginseng stems and leaves by GC was established. The
sample was extracted with n-hexane and purified by Florisil solid phase
extraction column. The limit of quantitation was 0.01 μg mL-1, the linear
relationship was good (r ≥ 0.9901). 7 days after inoculated with P. polymyxa, the
degradation rates of fluazinam, BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos, and DDT in the medium
were 94.77%, 70.34%, 77.92%, 78.30%, 66.70%, respectively (P < 0.05). The safety 
of 5 pesticide degradation products was investigated by GC-MS. The results showed
that after 7 days degradation, the main degradation products were alkanes, which 
are non-toxic and can't cause secondary pollution to the environment. The actual 
degradation results were verified by field experiments. The results indicated
that after sprayed 5 times with P. polymyxa, the degradation rates of fluazinam, 
BHC, PCNB, chlorpyrifos and DDT in the ginseng roots were 66.07%, 46.24%, 21.05%,
72.40%, 54.21%, respectively (P < 0.05). The degradation rates in ginseng stems
and leaves were 74.18%, 55.61%, 73.65%, 58.13%, 46.91%, respectively (P < 0.05). 
The results indicated that Paenibacillus polymyxa was an effective degradation
strain of 5 pesticides.
