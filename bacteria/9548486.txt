The HLA-DM loci encode the heterodimeric unconventional class II MHC molecules
that are coexpressed with conventional class II MHC molecules. DM molecules are
essential for the proper formation and function of conventional class II MHC
molecules. This report characterizes the DMB promoter both by in vivo footprint
and by in vitro functional analysis and reveals a promoter structure similar to
that of conventional class II MHC genes. DR-negative mutant cell lines
selectively defective in the transcription factor or class II trans-activator
(CIITA) were used to reveal a requirement for both these factors in DMB promoter 
activation. Complementation of defective cell lines with the appropriate
transcription factor reconstituted DMB promoter activation. Further analysis with
CIITA identified several mutant forms of CIITA that are trans-dominant-negative
mutants, i.e., they suppressed DMB promoter activation by transfected and
endogenous CIITA. These mutants may be used in abiological setting to
down-regulate the function of DM in Ag processing.
