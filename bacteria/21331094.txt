Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) causes typhoid fever. We show that
exposure of S. typhi to neuroendocrine stress hormones results in haemolysis,
which is associated with the release of haemolysin E in membrane vesicles. This
effect is attributed to increased expression of the small RNA micA and RNA
chaperone Hfq, with concomitant downregulation of outer membrane protein A.
Deletion of micA or the two-component signal-transduction system, CpxAR,
abolishes the phenotype. The hormone response is inhibited by the Î²-blocker
propranolol. We provide mechanistic insights into the basis of neuroendocrine
hormone-mediated haemolysis by S. typhi, increasing our understanding of
inter-kingdom signalling.
