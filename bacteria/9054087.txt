At joint replacement operations local air suction is used to reduce the air
pollution from organic solvents in the operation theatre during insertion of
cement and prosthesis. In order to find out whether the local suction in an
ultraclean-air operation theatre with laminar airflow influenced the number of
colony forming units (cfu) of bacterial in vicinity of the wound, one m3 of air
was sampled 20 cm and one metre from the wound before, during and after use of
local suction during insertion of cement and prosthesis using a Sartorius
membrane filter sampler. There was no significant difference between the groups
in the numbers of cfu of bacteria found. It is concluded that use of local air
suction over the operative area while cementing hip prosthesis does not affect
the number of bacteria in the vicinity of the operation.
