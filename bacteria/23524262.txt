Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations have been detected in gliomas,
cartilaginous tumors, and acute myeloid leukemias. IDH2 mutations are specific to
a single codon in the conserved and functionally important Arginine 172 (R172) or
Arginine 140 (R140). To date, we have established specific monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) against IDH2-R172K and IDH2-R172M. However, specific mAbs against
IDH2-R172W have not been reported. To establish IDH2-R172W-specific mAbs, we
immunized rats with IDH2-R172W peptides. Western-blot analysis showed that WMab-1
reacted with the IDH2-R172W recombinant protein, not with IDH2-wild type (WT) or 
other IDH2 mutants, indicating that WMab-1 is IDH2-R172W-specific. Furthermore,
WMab-1 specifically stained the IDH2-R172W-expressing cells in
immunocytochemistry, but did not stain IDH2-WT and IDH2-R172M-containing cells.
WMab-1 also specifically stained the IDH2-R172W-expressing glioma cells in
immunohistochemistry. This is the first report to establish an
anti-IDH2-R172W-specific mAb, which could be useful in the diagnosis of
IDH2-R172W-bearing tumors.
