In this study the ability of CYP109E1 from Bacillus megaterium to metabolize
vitamin D3 (VD3) was investigated. In an in vitro system using bovine adrenodoxin
reductase (AdR) and adrenodoxin (Adx4-108), VD3 was converted by CYP109E1 into
several products. Furthermore, a whole-cell system in B. megaterium MS941 was
established. The new system showed a conversion of 95% after 24h. By NMR analysis
it was found that CYP109E1 catalyzes hydroxylation of VD3 at carbons C-24 and
C-25, resulting in the formation of 24(S)-hydroxyvitamin D3 (24S(OH)VD3),
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)VD3) and 24S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24S,25(OH)2VD3).
Through time dependent whole-cell conversion of VD3, we identified that the
formation of 24S,25(OH)2VD3 by CYP109E1 is derived from VD3 via the intermediate 
24S(OH)VD3. Moreover, using docking analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, we
identified important active site residues capable of determining substrate
specificity and regio-selectivity. HPLC analysis of the whole-cell conversion
with the I85A-mutant revealed an increased selectivity towards 25-hydroxylation
of VD3 compared with the wild type activity, resulting in an approximately 2-fold
increase of 25(OH)VD3 production (45mgl-1day-1) compared to wild type
(24.5mgl-1day-1).
