BACKGROUND: The persistence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) within an
intensive care unit (ICU) possibly contained within dry surface biofilms, remains
a perplexing confounder and is a threat to patient safety. Identification of
residential locations of MDRO within the ICU is an intervention for which new
scientific approaches may assist in finding potential MDRO reservoirs.
METHOD: This study investigated a new approach to sampling using a more
aggressive environmental swabbing technique of high-touch objects (HTOs) and
surfaces, aided by 2 commercially available adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
bioluminometers.
RESULTS: A total of 13 individual MDRO locations identified in this pilot study. 
The use of ATP bioluminometers was significantly associated with the
identification of 12 of the 13 individual MDRO locations. The MDRO recovery and
readings from the 2 ATP bioluminometers were not significantly correlated with
distinct cutoffs for each ATP device, and there was no correlation between the 2 
ATP devices.
CONCLUSION: The specific MDRO locations were not limited to the immediate patient
surroundings or to any specific HTO or type of surface. The use of ATP testing
helped rapidly identify the soiled locations for MDRO sampling. The greatest
density of positive MDRO locations was around and within the clinical staff work 
station.
