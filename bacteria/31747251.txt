In living systems, the contact between cells is the basis of recognition,
differentiation, and orchestration of an immune response. Obstacles and barriers 
to biomolecular motion, especially for receptors at cellular synapses, critically
control these functions by creating an anisotropic environment. Whereas
conventional fluorescence fluctuation methods, such as fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, can only measure the 
isotropic diffusion of molecules, the two-dimensional pair correlation function
(2D-pCF) approach probes the anisotropic paths at different spatial locations
within an image, allowing the creation of high-resolution maps that can visualize
and quantify how molecules move in a living cell. In this work, we show how the
2D-pCF method maps the environment in cellular synapses as perceived by natural
killer (NK) cell receptors. In cultured human HLA null 721.221 cells, 2D-pCF
reveals the motion of inhibitory receptor HLA-Cw4-YFP coexpressed with KIR3DL1 to
be highly directional around specific loci, while these restrictions were absent 
in the case of HLA-B51-YFP coexpressed with KIR2DL1. Further, in freshly isolated
educated (H-2Dd) and uneducated (MHC-/-) primary murine NK cells, the 2D-pCF
method shows significant differences in the paths taken by activating receptor
NKp46 and inhibitory receptor Ly49A in educated compared to uneducated cells.
Altogether, we demonstrate that the 2D-pCF method is very powerful in informing
about the spatial organization of motion in cells. Our data support the
hypothesis that flexibility in the spatial arrangement of membrane receptors,
that is, the absence of barriers, is crucial for NK cell function.
