This report discusses a novel type of arylsulfotransferase (AST) which was
derived from human intestinal bacterium sulfated polyphenolic compounds when
p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNS) was taken as a donor substrate. (+)-Catechin,
(+/-)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin and (-)-epicatechin gallate were better
substrates than tyramine. (-)-Epigallocatechin and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate
were slightly worse substrates than tyramine. Although gallic acid was a bad
substrate, alkyl gallate esters were better substrates than tyramine. The degree 
of acceptor specificity increased in proportion to the length of the alkyl group 
up to the carbon number of five. Pedunculagin, geraniin and corilagin were less
effective than tyramine. Rosmarinic acid and penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose were 
similarly well sulfated. Two products, 4'-monosulfate and 4',5-disulfate of
(+)-catechin, were detected at a two-fold molar excess of PNS over (+)-catechin. 
When (+)-catechin-4'-monosulfate as an acceptor was enzymatically sulfated with
PNS as a donor, only the 4',5-disulfate was produced. Thus, arylsulfotransferase 
was useful for the convenient preparation of sulfate esters of polyphenols at
their specific hydroxyl groups.
