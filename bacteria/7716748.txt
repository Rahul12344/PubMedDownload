During two lambing seasons, 6500 ewes of a large sheep breeding unit were
investigated. Within this period, 467 ewes suffered from mastitis. The morbidity 
was 3.8% and the lethality 4.7%. In 84% of the investigated animals
udder-pathogenic bacteria were detected. Mostly, Pasteurella haemolytica and
Staphylococcus aureus were isolated as agents of ovine mastitis. Before and
during the antibiotic therapy the clinical symptoms (general condition,
temperature, milk appearance, consistency of the udder tissue) were recorded. The
combined antibiotic therapy, which consisted of parenteral and local
intracisternal applications, was mostly satisfactory concerning recovery from
mastitis and survival of the ewes. Only 17 ewes died from mastitis; most deaths
caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
