Umbilical cord blood (UCB) engraftment is in part limited by graft cell dose,
generally one log less than that of bone marrow (BM)/peripheral blood (PB) cell
grafts. Strategies toward increasing hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC)
homing to BM have been assessed to improve UCB engraftment. Despite recent
progress, a complete understanding of how HSPC homing and engraftment are
regulated is still elusive. We provide evidence that blocking erythropoietin
(EPO)-EPO receptor (R) signaling promotes homing to BM and early engraftment of
UCB CD34+ cells. A significant population of UCB CD34+ HSPC expresses cell
surface EPOR. Exposure of UCB CD34+ HSPC to EPO inhibits their migration and
enhances erythroid differentiation. This migratory inhibitory effect was reversed
by depleting EPOR expression on HSPC. Moreover, systemic reduction in EPO levels 
by hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) used in a preclinical mouse model and in a pilot
clinical trial promoted homing of transplanted UCB CD34+ HSPC to BM. Such a
systemic reduction of EPO in the host enhanced myeloid differentiation and
improved BM homing of UCB CD34+ cells, an effect that was overcome with exogenous
EPO administration. Of clinical relevance, HBO therapy before human UCB
transplantation was well-tolerated and resulted in transient reduction in EPO
with encouraging engraftment rates and kinetics. Our studies indicate that
systemic reduction of EPO levels in the host or blocking EPO-EPOR signaling may
be an effective strategy to improve BM homing and engraftment after allogeneic
UCB transplantation. This clinical trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov
(#NCT02099266).
