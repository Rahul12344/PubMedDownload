Background: One of the most interesting effects of probiotics is their ability to
modulate the immune system through the induction of cytokines and to enhance the 
host immune response.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of
glycerol-supplemented Lactobacillus reuteri on the transcription level of
interleukin (IL)-8 and human-beta-defensin (hBD)-2 expressed by epithelial cells 
after exposure to bacteria.
Materials and Methods: The confluent-cultured HaCat cell line (105 cells/mL) was 
exposed to Streptococcus mutans ATCC-25175 and Porphyromonas gingivalis
ATCC-33277 (107 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) for 24 h and challenged with
probiotic L. reuteri ATCC-55730 (107 CFU/mL) supplemented with glycerol.
Subsequently, the transcription levels of IL-8 and hBD-2 in HaCat cells were
analyzed using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In
addition, cell viability was analyzed using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. All the
obtained data were statistically analyzed using the one-way analysis of variance 
test, with P < 0.05 set as the level of significance.
Results: The MTT assays confirmed no cytotoxic effects of glycerol-supplemented
L. reuteri on HaCat cells (viability >90%). mRNA expression of IL-8 and hBD-2
increased after exposure to both bacteria. The presence of glycerol-supplemented 
L. reuteri significantly reduced the expression of IL-8 and hBD-2 on HaCat cells 
(P < 0.05).
Conclusion: Glycerol-supplemented L. reuteri reduced the expression of IL-8 and
hBD-2, and the results may be proof of principle for a probiotic approach to
combating inflammation. However, further studies are needed to validate this
probiotic effect.
