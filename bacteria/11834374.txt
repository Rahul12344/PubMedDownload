The susceptibility of cystic fibrosis patients to bacterial pathogens is
associated with deficient airway antimicrobial peptide activity, and
airway-surface-liquid dehydration with decreased transport velocity and
hypersecretion of mucus. Susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection has
been linked to the role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator protein as a receptor for P. aeruginosa. Binding of P. aeruginosa
coordinates lung clearance as part of innate immunity. The function of CFTR in
innate immunity to P. aeruginosa infection is multifactorial, with one key
component being a specific ligand-receptor interaction between the protein and
the microbe.
