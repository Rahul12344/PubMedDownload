BACKGROUND & AIMS: Most knowledge about gastrointestinal (GI)-tract dendritic
cells (DC) relies on murine studies where CD103+ DC specialize in generating
immune tolerance with the functionality of CD11b+/- subsets being unclear.
Information about human GI-DC is scarce, especially regarding regional
specifications. Here, we characterized human DC properties throughout the human
colon.
METHODS: Paired proximal (right/ascending) and distal (left/descending) human
colonic biopsies from 95 healthy subjects were taken; DC were assessed by flow
cytometry and microbiota composition assessed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
RESULTS: Colonic DC identified were myeloid (mDC, CD11c+CD123-) and further
divided based on CD103 and SIRPα (human analog of murine CD11b) expression.
CD103-SIRPα+ DC were the major population and with CD103+SIRPα+ DC were
CD1c+ILT3+CCR2+ (although CCR2 was not expressed on all CD103+SIRPα+ DC).
CD103+SIRPα- DC constituted a minor subset that were CD141+ILT3-CCR2-. Proximal
colon samples had higher total DC counts and fewer CD103+SIRPα+ cells. Proximal
colon DC were more mature than distal DC with higher stimulatory capacity for
CD4+CD45RA+ T-cells. However, DC and DC-invoked T-cell expression of mucosal
homing markers (β7, CCR9) was lower for proximal DC. CCR2 was expressed on
circulating CD1c+, but not CD141+ mDC, and mediated DC recruitment by colonic
culture supernatants in transwell assays. Proximal colon DC produced higher
levels of cytokines. Mucosal microbiota profiling showed a lower microbiota load 
in the proximal colon, but with no differences in microbiota composition between 
compartments.
CONCLUSIONS: Proximal colonic DC subsets differ from those in distal colon and
are more mature. Targeted immunotherapy using DC in T-cell mediated GI tract
inflammation may therefore need to reflect this immune compartmentalization.
