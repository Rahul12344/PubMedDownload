Objectives: Vitex grandifolia belongs to family Lamiaceae; it consists of
flowering plants and it is also called the mint family. The Yoruba people of
southwest Nigeria called it "Oriri" or "Efo oriri". This plant is classified as
an underutilized vegetable and little is known about its phytochemistry or its
biological evaluations.
Materials and Methods: Methanol extracts of the dried leaves and stem of the
plant were subjected to fractionation and isolation using vacuum layer and column
chromatography methods. The structures of the compounds were elucidated using
spectroscopic techniques including IR, 1D-, and 2D-NMR and by comparison with the
data reported in the literature. They were evaluated in vitro for the inhibition 
of monoamine recombinant human MAO-A and -B and anti-inflammatory activities.
Results: Three known flavonoids were isolated from the methanolic extract of the 
leaves of V. grandifolia for the first time to the best of our knowledge, i.e.
isoorientin (1), orientin (2), and isovitexin (3). Most of the isolated compounds
showed selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B, inhibition of MAO-B by
isoorientin (1) and orientin (2) were 9-fold more potent (IC50 (μg/mL) of 11.08
and 11.04) compared to the inhibition of MAO-A (IC50 (μg/mL) of ˃100), while
clorgyline and deprenyl were used as positive standards. The isolated flavonoids 
displayed good activity against the NF-ﭏb assay with IC50 (μg/mL) of 8.9, 12, and
18. This study establishes a link between the structure and the biological
activities on the basis of the different patterns of substitution, particularly
the C2=C3 double bond and the position of glucose moiety.
Conclusion: This study is the first to establish the phytochemistry of the polar 
part of V. grandifolia and the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective role of
these isolated compounds.
