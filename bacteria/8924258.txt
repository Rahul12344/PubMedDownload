OBJECTIVE: To analyse the role of the apoptosis-inducing Fas receptor in the
depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals.
METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from HIV-infected subjects
of all 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stages and from
non-infected controls were examined. A two-colour cytofluorometry was employed
using monoclonal antibodies against Fas receptor (CD95) in combination with the
surface markers CD4, CD8, CD28, CD26 and CD45RO. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-enriched
PBL were used as target cells to assess their susceptibility to lysis by CD4+
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which kill via the Fas pathway.
RESULTS: Fas+PBL are more elevated in HIV-infected individuals than in
HIV-negative controls and increase significantly from CDC stages A to C. Whereas 
Fas+CD4+ and Fas-CD4+ T-cell populations decline in parallel with the progression
of HIV infection, the Fas+CD8+, but not of the Fas-CD8+ fraction, significantly
increases. The Fas+CD8+ lymphocytes are susceptible to Fas-mediated lysis as they
are efficiently killed by Fas-ligand+CD4+CTL.
CONCLUSION: The Fas receptor may contribute, but not as a unique cause, to the
decline of CD4+ T cells in HIV-infected individuals. This and the significant
increase of the number of Fas+ CD8+ T cells indicates that Fas-mediated immune
regulation is disturbed.
