Mast cells, well established effectors in allergic disease, can be activated by
numerous stimuli. We previously found that the Fyn-Stat5B pathway is critical for
FcεRI-stimulated mast cell function. Because IgG receptors employ similar
signaling pathways, we investigated Fyn-Stat5B function downstream of FcγR. We
report that FcγR elicits Fyn-dependent Stat5B tyrosine phosphorylation in mast
cells. As we previously found for Fyn kinase, Stat5B is indispensable for
IgG-mediated mast cell cytokine expression and secretion. However, Stat5B KO
macrophages responded normally to FcγR signaling, indicating a lineage-restricted
role for Stat5B. This was consistent in vivo, since passive FcγR activation
induced anaphylaxis in a macrophage-dominated response even when Stat5B was
deleted. We further investigated this lineage restriction using the K/BxN model
of inflammatory arthritis. This model exhibits a rapid and transient mast
cell-dependent joint inflammation followed days later by a macrophage- and
neutrophil-dependent response. Consistent with our hypothesis, Fyn or Stat5B
deficiency did not protect mice from late joint swelling, but greatly reduced the
early mast cell-dependent response. This was associated with decreased joint and 
plasma histamine. We conclude that Fyn-Stat5B is a linage-restricted pathway
critical for IgG-mediated mast cell responses.
