The ars operon of the resistance plasmid R773 was found to produce moderate
levels of resistance to tellurite. A MIC of 64 micrograms of TeO3(2-) per ml was 
found for Escherichia coli cells harboring plasmids which contained all three of 
the structural genes (arsA, arsB, and arsC) of the anion-translocating ATPase.
MICs specified by plasmids carrying only one or two structural elements or the
cloning vector alone were 2 to 4 micrograms/ml. The rate of TeO3(2-) uptake was
found to be on the order of 55% less for cultures containing the resistance
plasmids.
