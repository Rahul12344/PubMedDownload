Assignment of the hydrogen bonded proton resonances in (Escherichia coli) tRNAGlu
by sequential melting.

Hilbers CW, Shulman RG.

The 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance peaks from the hydrogen bonded protons in 
(Escherichia coli) tRNA(Glu) in Mg(++) solutions have been measured at
temperatures between 25 degrees and 74 degrees . Between 25 degrees and 49
degrees four resonances broaden, three of which are assigned to the hU arm and
one to a G.C pair of the tertiary structure. By 64 degrees these four resonances 
have disappeared and the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum is fitted very well 
by a computer simulation based upon resonances from the acceptor, T-Psi-C, and
anticodon arms. At 66 degrees the resonances from the T-Psi-C arm are lost and at
74 degrees only those from the anticodon are left. All 20 resonances expected
from the cloverleaf model have been assigned by comparing the calculated
positions of resonances in a particular arm with the stepwise loss of intensity
with temperature. The root mean square error between calculated and observed
positions is 0.17 ppm. Resonances at the end of helical regions which are
sensitive to stacking beyond the helix allow us to conclude that the acceptor arm
is stacked upon the T-Psi-C in a regular helix and that G [unk]73 is stacked upon
base pair [unk]1-72 but the hU and anticodon arms are not stacked in a regular
helix upon the intervening base A [unk]27.
