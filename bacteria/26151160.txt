PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a
major cause of mortality in intensive care patients. Activation of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) by fibrates, such as WY-14643 (WY),
has been described to beneficially influence inflammation and experimental lung
injury. The impact of PPAR-α activation on alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) has
not been studied yet.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the effect of PPAR-α activator WY in
wild-type (WT) and in PPAR-α knockout (PPAR-α(-/-)) animals, mice were treated in
different regimes: mice received chow enriched with or without WY for 14 days
prior AEC isolation (in-vivo treatment). Furthermore, isolated AEC from both
groups were subsequently cultured with or without WY (in-vitro treatment). AEC
were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cell culture supernatant and cell 
lysate were used for analysis of pro-inflammatory mediators.
RESULTS: AEC challenged with LPS showed a significantly increased generation of
pro-inflammatory mediators. After in-vivo WY-exposure, AEC displayed
significantly reduced concentration of TNF-α, MIP-2, and TxB2 after LPS
stimulation. This beneficial effect was abrogated in PPAR-α(-/-) animals.
Interestingly, sole in-vitro application of WY-14643 failed to reduce levels of
pro-inflammatory mediators whereas we found an additive effect of a combined
in-vivo and in-vitro PPAR-α activation. PGE2 concentration remained high after
LPS challenge and was unaffected by WY treatment.
CONCLUSION: PPAR-α activation by in-vivo exposure to fibrates reduced the
inflammatory response in isolated AEC. These findings may facilitate further
studies investigating the translation of pharmacological PPAR-α activation into
clinical therapy of ARDS.
