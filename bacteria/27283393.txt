Behçet's disease (BD) is characterized by recurrent oro-genital ulcers,
mucocutaneous lesions, and serious organ involvement. We investigated the
salivary microbiome in BD using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4
region. Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 31 BD patients and 15
healthy controls, and in 9 BD patients, a second saliva sample was collected
following dental and periodontal treatment. Sequence analysis identified a total 
of 908 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present across all samples. Patients
had a microbial community structure that is significantly less diverse than
healthy controls. The most overabundant species in BD was Haemophilus
parainfluenzae, while the most depleted included Alloprevotella rava and species 
in the genus Leptotrichia. Periodontal treatment improved oral health indices in 
BD but had no short-term effect on bacterial community structure. Neither the
BD-associated genetic risk locus within the HLA-B/MICA region nor being on
immunosuppressive medications explained the differences between patients and
controls.
