Here we describe the design, Escherichia coli expression and characterization of 
a simplified, adaptable and functionally transparent single chain 4-α-helix
transmembrane protein frame that binds multiple heme and light activatable
porphyrins. Such man-made cofactor-binding oxidoreductases, designed from first
principles with minimal reference to natural protein sequences, are known as
maquettes. This design is an adaptable frame aiming to uncover core engineering
principles governing bioenergetic transmembrane electron-transfer function and
recapitulate protein archetypes proposed to represent the origins of
photosynthesis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Biodesign for
Bioenergetics--the design and engineering of electronic transfer cofactors,
proteins and protein networks, edited by Ronald L. Koder and J.L. Ross Anderson.
