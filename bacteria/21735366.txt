OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate new guidelines for MRSA admission screening 
and pre-emptive isolation implemented in response to a doubling of newly
diagnosed MRSA patients in 2007.
DESIGN: One-year surveillance (04/2008-03/2009).
SETTING: Patients admitted to the tertiary-care hospital in St. Gallen (700 beds)
and 10 affiliated public hospitals (890 beds) in Eastern Switzerland (MRSA rate
2.5% in isolates).
PATIENTS: Except for known MRSA carriers, all patients who underwent admission
screening in accordance with the guidelines and all MRSA patients newly detected 
by a clinical sample were included.
METHODS: Depending on epidemiological factors (stay in a foreign hospital, a
Swiss hospital with known high MRSA prevalence, or a chronic care facility) and
personal risk factors (wound, tracheostoma, urinary catheter, IVDU), patients
were risk stratified into screening and isolation, only screening or no screening
at all. MRSA admission screening included nasal, throat and axillary/inguinal
swabs, supplemented by wound swabs, urine and respiratory secretion whenever
appropriate (conventional culture).
RESULTS: A total of 6/161 (3.7%) MRSA admission screenings yielded positive
results (number needed to screen: 27). 2/32 (6.3%) pre-emptively isolated
patients were positive (number needed to isolate: 16). Only 6/27 (22.2%) newly
diagnosed MRSA patients were detected by admission screening, and the remaining
patients were detected by clinical sample during hospitalisation. A total of 80% 
of the MRSA positive patients had wounds. Swabs of axilla/inguina did not
increase the sensitivity of the admission screening.
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of low MRSA prevalence, admission screening of
patients at high risk for MRSA carriage detected only one out of five newly
diagnosed MRSA patients, emphasising the importance of standard precautions for
the prevention of MRSA transmission.
