Persistent infection or chronic inflammation contributes significantly to
tumourigenesis and tumour progression. C-X-C motif ligand 8 (CXCL8) is a
chemokine that acts as an important multifunctional cytokine to modulate tumour
proliferation, invasion and migration in an autocrine or paracrine manner.
Studies have suggested that CXCL8 and its cognate receptors, C-X-C chemokine
receptor 1 (CXCR1) and C-X-C chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), mediate the initiation
and development of various cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung
cancer, colorectal carcinoma and melanoma. CXCL8 also integrates with multiple
intracellular signalling pathways to produce coordinated effects.
Neovascularisation, which provides a basis for fostering tumour growth and
metastasis, is now recognised as a critical function of CXCL8 in the tumour
microenvironment. In this review, we summarize the biological functions and
clinical significance of the CXCL8 signalling axis in cancer. We also propose
that CXCL8 may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.
