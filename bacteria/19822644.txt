The eye is protected by the ocular immunosurveillance system. We show that tear
duct-associated lymphoid tissue (TALT) is located in the mouse lacrimal sac and
shares immunological characteristics with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues
(MALTs), including the presence of M cells and immunocompetent cells for antigen 
uptake and subsequent generation of mucosal immune responses against ocularly
encountered antigens and bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Initiation of
TALT genesis began postnatally; it occurred even in germ-free conditions and was 
independent of signaling through organogenesis regulators, including inhibitor of
DNA binding/differentiation 2, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor gammat,
lymphotoxin (LT) alpha1beta2-LTbetaR, and lymphoid chemokines (CCL19, CCL21, and 
CXCL13). Thus, TALT shares immunological features with MALT but has a distinct
tissue genesis mechanism and plays a key role in ocular immunity.
