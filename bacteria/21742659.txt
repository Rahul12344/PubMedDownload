BACKGROUND: Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are possibly the "next
frontier" in infection prevention. Binding them to mesh could reduce the rate of 
mesh infections. This study identifies an antimicrobial agent capable of
significant antibacterial activity when bound to mesh.
METHODS: Lysozyme, human beta defensin (HBD-3), human cathelicidin (LL-37), and
lysostaphin were adsorbed to polypropylene mesh at various concentrations.
Treated meshes were placed in a suspension of 1 Ã— 10(6) Staphylococcus aureus.
Antibacterial action was monitored by turbidimetric assay, fluorescent imaging,
and a colony counting method.
RESULTS: A very high rate of lysis of S aureus cells was observed in the
lysostaphin-treated group as measured by optical density; none survived as seen
on colony count assays. Optical density for mesh coated with lysozyme, HBD-3, and
LL-37 did not differ from untreated controls, with 100% survival rates by colony 
counts.
CONCLUSION: Lysostaphin had superior antibacterial activity following adsorption 
to mesh.
