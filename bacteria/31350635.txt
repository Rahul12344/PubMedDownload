The cobalamin-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme TsrM catalyzes 
the methylation of C2 of L-tryptophan to form 2-methyltryptophan during the
biosynthesis of thiostrepton A. Although TsrM is a member of the radical SAM
superfamily, unlike all other annotated members, it does not catalyze a reductive
cleavage of SAM to a 5'-deoxyadenosyl 5'-radical intermediate. In fact, it has
been proposed that TsrM catalyzes its reaction through two polar nucleophilic
displacements, with its cobalamin cofactor cycling directly between
methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and cob(I)alamin. Nevertheless, the enzyme has been
stated to require the action of a reductant, which can be satisfied by
dithiothreitol. By contrast, all other annotated RS enzymes require a reductant
that exhibits a much lower reduction potential, which is necessary for the
reductive cleavage of SAM. Herein, we show that TsrM can catalyze multiple
turnovers in the absence of any reducing agent, but only when it is pre-loaded
with MeCbl. When hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl) or cob(II)alamin is bound to TsrM, a
reductant is required to convert it to cob(I)alamin, which can acquire a methyl
group directly from SAM. Our studies suggest that TsrM uses an external reductant
to prime its reaction by converting bound OHCbl or cob(II)alamin to MeCbl, and to
regenerate the MeCbl form of the cofactor upon adventitious oxidation of the
cob(I)alamin intermediate to cob(II)alamin.
