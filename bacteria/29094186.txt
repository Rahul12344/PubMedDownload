Prion diseases are caused by a misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrP) to 
a pathogenic isoform named PrPSc. Prions exist as strains, which are
characterized by specific pathological and biochemical properties likely encoded 
in the three-dimensional structure of PrPSc. However, whether cofactors determine
these different PrPSc conformations and how this relates to their specific
biological properties is largely unknown. To understand how different cofactors
modulate prion strain generation and selection, Protein Misfolding Cyclic
Amplification was used to create a diversity of infectious recombinant prion
strains by propagation in the presence of brain homogenate. Brain homogenate is
known to contain these mentioned cofactors, whose identity is only partially
known, and which facilitate conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. We thus obtained a mix
of distinguishable infectious prion strains. Subsequently, we replaced brain
homogenate, by different polyanionic cofactors that were able to drive the
evolution of mixed prion populations toward specific strains. Thus, our results
show that a variety of infectious recombinant prions can be generated in vitro
and that their specific type of conformation, i.e., the strain, is dependent on
the cofactors available during the propagation process. These observations have
significant implications for understanding the pathogenesis of prion diseases and
their ability to replicate in different tissues and hosts. Importantly, these
considerations might apply to other neurodegenerative diseases for which
different conformations of misfolded proteins have been described.
