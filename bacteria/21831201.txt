MBL is a serum lectin that activates the lectin pathway of the complement system.
MBL forms complexes with three types of MASPs. Upon binding to Salmonella
serogroup C-specific oligosaccharide, MBL activates the alternative pathway via a
C2-bypass pathway without involving MASP-2, C2 or C4. We demonstrate that
mannan-bound MBL activates the alternative pathway via a C2-bypass pathway that
requires MASP-2 and C4. Thus, depending on the ligands to which MBL binds, there 
may be two distinct MBL-mediated C2-bypass pathways.
