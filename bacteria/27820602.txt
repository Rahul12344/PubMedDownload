Inflammation induced by innate immunity influences the development of T
cell-mediated autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis and its animal model,
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We found that strong activation 
of innate immunity induced Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)
inflammasome-independent and interferon-β (IFNβ)-resistant EAE (termed type B
EAE), whereas EAE induced by weak activation of innate immunity requires the
NLRP3 inflammasome and is sensitive to IFNβ treatment. Instead, an alternative
inflammatory mechanism, including membrane-bound lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR)
and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), is involved in type B EAE development, and 
type B EAE is ameliorated by antagonizing these receptors. Relative expression of
Ltbr and Cxcr2 genes was indeed enhanced in patients with IFNβ-resistant multiple
sclerosis. Remission was minimal in type B EAE due to neuronal damages induced by
semaphorin 6B upregulation on CD4+ T cells. Our data reveal a new inflammatory
mechanism by which an IFNβ-resistant EAE subtype develops.
