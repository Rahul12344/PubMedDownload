Neisseria meningitidis is a human pathogen that can cause fatal sepsis and
meningitis once it reaches the blood stream and the nervous system. Here we
demonstrate that a fragment, released upon proteolysis of the surface-exposed
protein Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), by the bacterial protease
NalP, alters the endothelial permeability by inducing the internalization of the 
adherens junction protein VE-cadherin. We found that C2 rapidly accumulates in
mitochondria where it induces the production of reactive oxygen species: the
latter are required for the phosphorylation of the junctional protein and for its
internalization that, in turn, is responsible for the endothelial leakage. Our
data support the notion that the NHBA-derived fragment C2 might contribute to the
extensive vascular leakage typically associated with meningococcal sepsis.
