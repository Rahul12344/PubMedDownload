Serotype-independent protein-based pneumococcal vaccines represent attractive
alternatives to capsular polysaccharide-based vaccines. The aim of this study was
to identify novel immunogenic proteins from Streptococcus pneumoniae that may be 
used in protein-based pneumococcal vaccine. An immunoproteomics approach and a
humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse model were used to identify S.
pneumoniae proteins that are immunogenic for the human immune system. Among the
several proteins identified, SP1683 was selected, recombinantly produced, and
infection and colonization murine models were used to evaluate the capacity of
SP1683 to elicit protective responses, in comparison to known pneumococcal
immunogenic proteins (PhtD and detoxified pneumolysin, dPly). Immunisation with
SP1683 elicited a weaker antibody response than immunisation with PhtD and did
not provide protection in the model of invasive disease. However, similar to
PhtD, it was able to significantly reduce colonization in the mouse model of
nasopharyngeal carriage. Treatment with anti-IL17A and anti-IL17F antibodies
abolished the protection against colonization elicited by SP1683 or PhtD + dPly, 
which indicated that the protection afforded in this model was Th17-dependent. In
conclusion, intranasal immunization with the pneumococcal protein SP1683
conferred IL17-dependent protection against nasopharyngeal carriage in mice, but 
systemic immunization did not protect against invasive disease. These results do 
not support the use of SP1683 as an isolated pneumococcal vaccine antigen.
Nevertheless, SP1683 could be used as a first line of defence in formulations
combining several proteins.
