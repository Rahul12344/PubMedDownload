The immune and reproductive functions of human NK cells are regulated by
interactions of the C1 and C2 epitopes of HLA-C with C1-specific and C2-specific 
lineage III killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR). This rapidly evolving and
diverse system of ligands and receptors is restricted to humans and great apes.
In this context, the orangutan has particular relevance because it represents an 
evolutionary intermediate, one having the C1 epitope and corresponding KIR but
lacking the C2 epitope. Through a combination of direct sequencing, KIR
genotyping, and data mining from the Great Ape Genome Project, we characterized
the KIR alleles and haplotypes for panels of 10 Bornean orangutans and 19
Sumatran orangutans. The orangutan KIR haplotypes have between 5 and 10 KIR
genes. The seven orangutan lineage III KIR genes all locate to the centromeric
region of the KIR locus, whereas their human counterparts also populate the
telomeric region. One lineage III KIR gene is Bornean specific, one is Sumatran
specific, and five are shared. Of 12 KIR gene-content haplotypes, 5 are Bornean
specific, 5 are Sumatran specific, and 2 are shared. The haplotypes have
different combinations of genes encoding activating and inhibitory C1 receptors
that can be of higher or lower affinity. All haplotypes encode an inhibitory C1
receptor, but only some haplotypes encode an activating C1 receptor. Of 130 KIR
alleles, 55 are Bornean specific, 65 are Sumatran specific, and 10 are shared.
