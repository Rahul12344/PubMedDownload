Type I natural killer T cells (NKT cells) are characterized by an invariant
variable region 14-joining region 18 (V(α)14-J(α)18) T cell antigen receptor
(TCR) α-chain and recognition of the glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)
restricted to the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d. Here we describe a population
of α-GalCer-reactive NKT cells that expressed a canonical V(α)10-J(α)50 TCR
α-chain, which showed a preference for α-glucosylceramide (α-GlcCer) and
bacterial α-glucuronic acid-containing glycolipid antigens. Structurally, despite
very limited TCRα sequence identity, the V(α)10 TCR-CD1d-α-GlcCer complex had a
docking mode similar to that of type I TCR-CD1d-α-GalCer complexes, although
differences at the antigen-binding interface accounted for the altered antigen
specificity. Our findings provide new insight into the structural basis and
evolution of glycolipid antigen recognition and have notable implications for the
scope and immunological role of glycolipid-specific T cell responses.
