As tumor PD-L1 provides signals to anti-tumor PD-1+ T cells that blunt their
functions, αPD-1 and αPD-L1 antibodies have been developed as anti-cancer
immunotherapies based on interrupting this signaling axis. However, tumor
cell-intrinsic PD-L1 signals also regulate immune-independent tumor cell
proliferation and mTOR signals, among other important effects. Tumor initiating
cells (TIC) generate carcinomas, resist treatments and promote relapse. We show
here that in murine B16 melanoma and ID8agg ovarian carcinoma cells, TIC express 
more PD-L1 versus non-TIC. Silencing PD-L1 in B16 and ID8agg cells by shRNA
("PD-L1lo") reduced TIC numbers, the canonical TIC genes nanog and pou5f1 (oct4),
and functions as assessed by tumorosphere development, immune-dependent and
immune-independent tumorigenesis, and serial transplantability in vivo.
Strikingly, tumor PD-L1 sensitized TIC to interferon-γ and rapamycin in vitro.
Cell-intrinsic PD-L1 similarly drove functional TIC generation, canonical TIC
gene expression, and sensitivity to interferon-γ and rapamycin in human ES2
ovarian cancer cells. Thus, tumor-intrinsic PD-L1 signals promote TIC generation 
and virulence, possibly by promoting canonical TIC gene expression, suggesting
that PD-L1 has novel signaling effects on cancer pathogenesis and treatment
responses.
