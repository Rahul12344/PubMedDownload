The HLA allelic frequency was determined in three groups of autoimmune
endocrinopathies: A) 30 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, B) 20 patients with
polyglandular activation of autoimmunity, and C) 10 patients with the autoimmune 
polyglandular syndrome type II. The groups were defined by the clinical state and
serological parameters. Healthy blood donors of Caucasian population from the US 
database of HLA frequencies served as the controls. In group A, a higher
occurrence of HLA-A24 (21.7 %) was found as compared to group B (5.0 %) and to
the controls (8.5 %), of HLA-B27 (15.0 %) and of HLA-DR-11 (20 %) as compared to 
the controls (4.2 % and 8.5 %). In group B, a higher occurrence of HLA-A3 (25.0
%) was found as compared to group A (10 %) and to the controls (11.8 %), and of
HLA-B8 (22.5 %) as compared to group A (8.3 %) and to the controls (8.6 %). In
this group the occurrence of HLA-DR3 (30.0 %) was higher as compared to group A
(10.0 %) and to the controls (9.8 %) and of HLA-B8 (30.0 %) as compared to group 
A (8.3 %) and to the controls (8.6 %). Genetic markers indicate a similarity of
groups B and C. Patients in these groups could be at different stages of the same
disease, however, some distinctions between them lead us to consider the
possibility whether different epigenetic factors could extend the difference
between these groups in the course of clinical development.
