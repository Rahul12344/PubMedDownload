Microcosms for enrichment of DDT degrading microorganisms were monitored using
culture-dependent and -independent methods. Culture dependent methods isolated
several strains with DDT degradation potential, Pseudomonas species being the
most frequent. One isolate, Streptomyces sp. strain D3, had a degradation rate of
77% with 20mgL-1 of DDT after 7days incubation, D3 also had degradation rates of 
75% and 30% for PCB77 (3,3',4,4'-tetrachloro biphenyl) and PCNB
(pentachloronitrobenzene) respectively. Culture-independent high-throughput
sequencing identified a different subset of the microbial community within the
enrichment microcosms to the culture dependent method. Pseudomonas, the most
frequently isolated strain, only represented the 12th most abundant operational
taxonomic unit in the sequencing dataset (relative abundance 0.9%). The most
frequently observed bacterial genus in the culture-independent analysis did not
correspond with those recovered by culture-dependent methods. These results
suggested that deep sequencing followed by a targeted isolation approach might
provide an advantageous route to bioremediation studies.
