BACKGROUND: T-cell infiltrates may persist in muscle tissue of polymyositis (PM) 
and dermatomyositis (DM) patients despite aggressive immunosuppressive treatment.
Here, we investigated to what extent persistent T cells in affected muscle were
FOXP3+, a marker for regulatory T cells (Tregs), or CD244+, a marker for CD28null
T cells, and whether their presence correlated to clinical outcome. The
sensitivity of CD28null T cells towards glucocorticoid and Treg-mediated
immunosuppression was also investigated.
METHODS: Muscle biopsies from 16 newly diagnosed or untreated patients with PM/DM
were investigated by immunohistochemistry for expression of CD3, FOXP3 and CD244 
before and after treatment with glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents. For
clinical evaluation, serum levels of creatine kinase, muscle performance (FI and 
MMT8), disease activity (MITAX) and disability (HAQ) were measured. In vitro
suppressive effects of glucocorticoids and Tregs on T-cell activation were
measured by CD69 upregulation.
RESULTS: Before treatment, CD244+ cells were present at higher proportions
compared to FOXP3+ cells in the inflamed muscle. Following treatment, FOXP3+ cell
numbers decreased while CD244+ cells persisted. Patients with impaired muscle
function (<75 % FI) post-treatment had higher levels of CD244+ cells in the
follow-up biopsy compared to those with FI >75 %. MITAX and HAQ correlated with
the number of CD244+ cells post-treatment. CD4+CD28null T cells displayed lower
sensitivity towards both glucocorticoid and Treg-mediated immunosuppression in
vitro compared to their CD28+ counterparts.
CONCLUSIONS: Poor outcome in patients with myositis following immunosuppressive
therapy was linked to persistence of CD244+ (CD28null) T cells in muscle tissue, 
suggesting their resistance against immunosuppression. A relative loss of
regulatory T cells could also contribute to poor clinical outcome given their
recently ascribed role in muscle tissue regeneration.
