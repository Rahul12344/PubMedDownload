Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia
characterized with a translocation between promyelocytic leukemia gene (PML) on
chromosome 15 and retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (RARα) on chromosome 17.
Transcription of this fusion gene results in PML/RARα fusion protein blocking
expression of critical genes involved in differentiation of myeloid cells through
interaction with RAR element. PML/RARα fusion protein prevents normal function of
PML and RARα as well as inhibiting apoptosis. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an
important agent for the treatment of relapsed and newly diagnosed APL. ATO
induces apoptosis, autophagy, and partial cellular differentiation as well as
inhibiting cell growth and angiogenesis. Recognition of signaling pathways and
molecular mechanisms induced by ATO can be effective for discovering novel
treatment strategies to target leukemia cells. Also, it can be developed for the 
treatment of a variety of cancer cells. This review provides a perspective on
anticancerous effects of ATO on APL and leukemia cells.
