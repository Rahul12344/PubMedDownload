Burkholderia pseudomallei is a potential bioterror agent and the causative agent 
of melioidosis, a severe disease that is endemic in areas of Southeast Asia and
Northern Australia. Infection is often associated with bacterial dissemination to
distant sites, and there are many possible disease manifestations, with
melioidosis septic shock being the most severe. Eradication of the organism
following infection is difficult, with a slow fever-clearance time, the need for 
prolonged antibiotic therapy and a high rate of relapse if therapy is not
completed. Mortality from melioidosis septic shock remains high despite
appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Prevention of disease and a reduction in
mortality and the rate of relapse are priority areas for future research efforts.
Studying how the disease is acquired and the host-pathogen interactions involved 
will underpin these efforts; this review presents an overview of current
knowledge in these areas, highlighting key topics for evaluation.
