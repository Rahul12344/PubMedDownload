We have studied how cholera toxin (CT) and its non-toxic cell-binding B-subunit
(CTB) affect the activation of pure human T cells in an anti-CD3-driven system.
CT, as opposed to CTB, strongly suppressed the proliferative responses as well as
cytokine production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CT however, had a differential
effect on naive and activated/memory T cell subsets. Costimulation through
exogenous IL-2 or through CD28 cross-linking rescued the proliferation of
CT-treated naive CD45RA+ T cells, but not of activated/memory CD45RO+ cells. IL-2
production and IL-2 receptor expression were markedly reduced by CT in all T cell
fractions, i.e. also in CD45RA+ cells which had maintained proliferative
responses. However, the proliferative responses of CT-treated CD45RA+ T cells
were IL-2-dependent, as shown by blocking experiments using anti-IL-2 antibodies.
These results indicate (i) that CTB has no cytostatic effect on human T cells,
(ii) that CT affects proliferation and cytokine production by two different
signal pathways, and (iii) that CT might interact with a signal pathway generated
through or influenced by CD45.
