Electrostatic force is investigated as one of the components of the adhesion
force between Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) spores and planar surfaces. The surface
potentials of a Bt spore and a mica surface are experimentally obtained using a
combined atomic force microscopy (AFM)-scanning surface potential microscopy
technique. On the basis of experimental information, the surface charge density
of the spores is estimated at 0.03 microC/cm(2) at 20% relative humidity and
decreases with increasing humidity. The Coulombic force is introduced for the
spore-mica system (both charged, nonconductive surfaces), and an electrostatic
image force is introduced to the spore-gold system because gold is electrically
conductive. The Coulombic force for spore-mica is repulsive because the
components are similarly charged, while the image force for the spore-gold system
is attractive. The magnitude of both forces decreases with increasing humidity.
The electrostatic forces are added to other force components, e.g., van der Waals
and capillary forces, to obtain the adhesion force for each system. The adhesion 
forces measured by AFM are compared to the estimated values. It is shown that the
electrostatic (Coulombic and image) forces play a significant role in the
adhesion force between spores and planar surfaces.
