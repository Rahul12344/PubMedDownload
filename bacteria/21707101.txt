An Escherichia coli strain was engineered to synthesize 1-hexanol from glucose by
extending the coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent 1-butanol synthesis reaction sequence
catalyzed by exogenous enzymes. The C4-acyl-CoA intermediates were first
synthesized via acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AtoB), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
dehydrogenase (Hbd), crotonase (Crt), and trans-enoyl-CoA reductase (Ter) from
various organisms. The butyryl-CoA synthesized was further extended to
hexanoyl-CoA via Î²-ketothiolase (BktB), Hbd, Crt, and Ter. Finally, hexanoyl-CoA 
was reduced to yield 1-hexanol by aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhE2). Enzyme 
activities for the C6 intermediates were confirmed by assays using HPLC and GC.
1-Hexanol was secreted to the fermentation medium under anaerobic conditions.
Furthermore, co-expressing formate dehydrogenase (Fdh) from Candida boidinii
increased the 1-hexanol titer. This demonstration of 1-hexanol production by
extending the 1-butanol pathway provides the possibility to produce other medium 
chain length alcohols using the same strategy.
