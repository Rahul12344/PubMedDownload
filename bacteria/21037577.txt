To investigate the role of the kinase Zap70 in T cells, we generated mice
expressing a Zap70 mutant whose catalytic activity can be selectively blocked by 
a small-molecule inhibitor. We found that conventional naive, effector and memory
T cells were dependent on the kinase activity of Zap70 for their activation,
which demonstrated a nonredundant role for Zap70 in signals induced by the T cell
antigen receptor (TCR). In contrast, the catalytic activity of Zap70 was not
required for activation of the GTPase Rap1 and inside-out signals that promote
integrin adhesion. This Zap70 kinase-independent pathway was sufficient for the
suppressive activity of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells), which was unperturbed 
by inhibition of the catalytic activity of Zap70. Our results indicate Zap70 is a
likely therapeutic target.
