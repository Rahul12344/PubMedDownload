Chronological aging and a variety of stressors are driving forces towards
immunosenescence. While much attention was paid to the main T cell component, α/β
T cells, few studies concentrate on the impact of age on γ/δ T cells'
characteristics. The latter are important players of adaptive immunity but also
have features associated with innate immunity. Vδ2+ are the main component of γ/δ
while Vδ1+ T cells expand upon Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and with age. The 
Vδ2+ T cells are not influenced by persistent infections but do contribute to
immunosurveillance against bacterial pathogens. Here, we focus on Vδ2+ T cells
and report that their composition and functionality is not altered in older
adults. We have performed a side-by-side comparison of α/β and Vδ2 cells by using
two robust markers of T cell replicative history and cell differentiation (CD28
and CD27), and cytokine secretion (IFN-γ and TNF-α). Significant differences in
Vδ2 versus α/β homeostasis, as well as phenotypic and functional changes emerged.
However, the data strongly suggest a sustained functionality of the Vδ2
population with age, independently of the challenge. This suggests differential
trajectories towards immunosenescence in α/β and Vδ2+ T cells, most likely
explained by their intrinsic functions.
