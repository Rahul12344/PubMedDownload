Hydrogen peroxide (HP) induced the phosphorylation of cAMP response element
binding protein (CREB) on Ser133 in Jurkat T lymphocytes via p38 and MSK1.
Although CREB Ser133 was phosphorylated, increases in HP-stimulated CREB-mediated
transcription were absent. T lymphocyte stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28
induced CREB Ser133 phosphorylation, as well as CREB-mediated transcriptional
activity. When CD3/CD28-stimulated lymphocytes were treated with HP, Ser133 was
phosphorylated, but TCR-induced CREB-mediated transcriptional activity was
reduced. These data provide insight into a potential mechanism by which oxidative
stress can alter T cell receptor-induced CREB activation and responsiveness.
