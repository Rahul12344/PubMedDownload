A method is described for the isolation of peroxisomes from mitochondria-enriched
fractions obtained from both species of nematodes. The distributions of these
organelles are characterized after density gradient centrifugation in sucrose or 
Percoll by urate oxidase and catalase activities. The possession of peroxisomes
may be part of an important defence mechanism in parasites.
