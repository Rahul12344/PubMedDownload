Immunotherapy is a promising treatment for liver cancer. Here, we tested the
ability of the attenuated hepatocellular carcinoma-specific Listeria vaccine
(Lmdd-MPFG) to treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a mouse model.
Immunization with the vaccine caused a strong anti-tumor response, especially in 
mice reinfused with dendritic cells (DCs). In mice that were also administered
DCs, tumor suppression was accompanied by the strongest cytotoxic T lymphocyte
response of all treatment groups and by induced differentiation of CD4+ T cells, 
especially Th17 cells. Additionally, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine caused maturation of
DCs in vitro. We demonstrated the synergistic effect of TLR4 and NLRP3 or NOD1
signaling pathways in LM-induced DC activation. These results suggest that the
Lmdd-MPFG vaccine is a feasible strategy for preventing HCC.
