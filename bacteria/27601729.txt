Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) function in most tissues but have cell
type-specific effects. Given the relatively small number of BMP receptors, this
exquisite signaling specificity requires additional molecules to regulate this
pathway's output. The receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) is
critical for neuromuscular junction formation and maintenance. Here, we show that
MuSK also promotes BMP signaling in muscle cells. MuSK bound to BMP4 and related 
BMPs with low nanomolar affinity in vitro and to the type I BMP receptors ALK3
and ALK6 in a ligand-independent manner both in vitro and in cultured myotubes.
High-affinity binding to BMPs required the third, alternatively spliced MuSK
immunoglobulin-like domain. In myoblasts, endogenous MuSK promoted BMP4-dependent
phosphorylation of SMADs and transcription of Id1, which encodes a transcription 
factor involved in muscle differentiation. Gene expression profiling showed that 
MuSK was required for the BMP4-induced expression of a subset of genes in
myoblasts, including regulator of G protein signaling 4 (Rgs4). In myotubes, MuSK
enhanced the BMP4-induced expression of a distinct set of genes, including
transcripts characteristic of slow muscle. MuSK-mediated stimulation of BMP
signaling required type I BMP receptor activity but was independent of MuSK
tyrosine kinase activity. MuSK-dependent expression of Rgs4 resulted in the
inhibition of Ca(2+) signaling induced by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor
in myoblasts. These findings establish that MuSK has dual roles in muscle cells, 
acting both as a tyrosine kinase-dependent synaptic organizing molecule and as a 
BMP co-receptor that shapes BMP transcriptional output and cholinergic signaling.
