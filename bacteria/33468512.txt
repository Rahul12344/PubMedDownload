We describe the case of Mycoplasma hominis septic arthritis in a 58-year-old
woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis on
immunosuppressive therapy with rituximab. Treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies
(eg, rituximab) leads to an immediate depletion of B cells and hence risk of
reductions in immunoglobulins and increased risk of infections. This effect may
last long after drug cessation. M. hominis is commensal to the genitourinary
tract in sexually active adults. Extragenital M. hominis infections including
septic arthritis are rare, but hypogammaglobulinaemia is a predisposing factor.
As M. hominis requires extended culture, special media or PCR analysis, it is not
tested routinely, which in many cases delays diagnosis and correct treatment. In 
our case, a diagnosis of M. hominis septic arthritis was made after 9 weeks by
PCR analysis and culture of joint fluid. The patient responded well to an 8-week 
treatment course of moxifloxacin and doxycycline.
