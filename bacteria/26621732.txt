In contrast with the common detection of T cells that recognize MHC, CD1a, CD1c, 
or CD1d proteins, CD1b autoreactive T cells have been difficult to isolate in
humans. Here we report the development of polyvalent complexes of CD1b proteins
and carbohydrate backbones (dextramers) and their use in identifying CD1b
autoreactive T cells from human donors. Activation is mediated by αβ T-cell
receptors (TCRs) binding to CD1b-phospholipid complexes, which is sufficient to
activate autoreactive responses to CD1b-expressing cells. Using mass spectrometry
and T-cell responses to scan through the major classes of phospholipids, we
identified phosphatidylglycerol (PG) as the immunodominant lipid antigen. T cells
did not discriminate the chemical differences that distinguish mammalian PG from 
bacterial PG. Whereas most models of T-cell recognition emphasize TCR
discrimination of differing self and foreign structures, CD1b autoreactive T
cells recognize lipids with dual self and foreign origin. PG is rare in the
cellular membranes that carry CD1b proteins. However, bacteria and mitochondria
are rich in PG, so these data point to a more general mechanism of immune
detection of infection- or stress-associated lipids.
