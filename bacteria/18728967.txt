The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether human umbilical cord 
blood (UCB) as well as bone marrow (BM) can generate hepatocyte lineage cells in 
a simple culture condition. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) separated from UCB and BM
were cultured in the presence of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1, FGF-2, stem
cell factor (SCF), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). The cultured cells were
analyzed for morphology and for the expression of mRNAs and/or proteins of
hepatocyte lineage markers. Both the UCB and BM MNCs grown in the given culture
condition yielded large, round cells that were adherent to the culture dishes.
RT-PCR analysis showed that mRNAs of albumin (ALB), cytokeratin (CK)-18, and
alpha-fetoprotein were expressed from day 7 in both the UCB- and BM-derived
cells. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the large, round cells expressed
not only ALB and CK-19 but also proliferating cell nuclear antigen, implying the 
proliferative potential of hepatocyte lineage cells. Therefore, UCB as well as BM
can give rise to hepatocyte lineage cells in the simple culture condition with
HGF, SCF, FGF-1, and FGF-2. These cells may be one of the potential candidates of
cell sources for the cytotherapy of hepatic disease, although it remains to be
determined if the hepatocyte lineage cells are derived from plastic hematopoietic
stem cells or from liver stem cells that reside in UCB or BM.
