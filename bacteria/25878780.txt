The diagnosis of IgA-dominant post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) may be
challenging, as it must be differentiated from that of active IgA nephropathy.
Predominant clinicopathologic features of IgA-dominant PIGN substantially overlap
with those of active IgA nephropathy. Here, we present a case of a 67-year-old
woman with rapidly rising serum creatinine, proteinuria and severe hypertension. 
The kidney biopsy findings included some features of IgA-dominant PIGN while
others were more consistent with classical IgA nephropathy. We describe this
patient's immune profile at the time of acute kidney injury and review the
literature regarding differentiation of the two entities.
