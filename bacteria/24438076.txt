Silkworm haemolymph induced both the cessation of growth and an increase in
triglyceride (triacylglycerol) storage in BmN4 cells. We purified the growth
inhibitory factor from the silkworm haemolymph and identified this protein as the
Bombyx mori PP (promoting protein), an orthologue of NPC2 (Niemann-Pick disease
type C2) protein. Recombinant silkworm NPC2 inhibited cellular proliferation and 
increased triglyceride accumulation in BmN4 cells. Injection of either the
recombinant protein or antiserum of NPC2 into living silkworms increased or
decreased respectively triglyceride levels in the fat body. A mutation that
depletes the cholesterol-binding capacity did not abolish the activity of NPC2.
We further revealed that NPC2 induced the phosphorylation of AMPK (AMP-activated 
protein kinase) and that an AMPK inhibitor suppressed NPC2-dependent triglyceride
accumulation. These findings suggest that NPC2 induces triglyceride accumulation 
via the activation of AMPK independently of its cholesterol-binding capacity in
the silkworm.
