Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT) catalyzes the penultimate step in
coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis: the reversible adenylation of
4'-phosphopantetheine yielding 3'-dephospho-CoA and pyrophosphate. Wild-type PPAT
from Escherichia coli was purified to homogeneity. N-terminal sequence analysis
revealed that the enzyme is encoded by a gene designated kdtB, purported to
encode a protein involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis. The gene, here
renamed coaD, is found in a wide range of microorganisms, indicating that it
plays a key role in the synthesis of 3'-dephospho-CoA. Overexpression of coaD
yielded highly purified recombinant PPAT, which is a homohexamer of 108 kDa. Not 
less than 50% of the purified enzyme was found to be associated with CoA, and a
method was developed for its removal. A steady state kinetic analysis of the
reverse reaction revealed that the mechanism of PPAT involves a ternary complex
of enzyme and substrates. Since purified PPAT lacks dephospho-CoA kinase
activity, the two final steps of CoA biosynthesis in E. coli must be catalyzed by
separate enzymes.
