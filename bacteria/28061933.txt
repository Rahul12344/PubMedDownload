â€ƒ Modeling and optimization tools play a key role in membrane fouling control in 
membrane bioreactor (MBR) systems by delineating the more important variables
involved. In this study, the influence of sludge retention time (SRT), aeration
rate and filtration mode on hollow fiber membrane fouling was investigated. Using
the response surface methodology (RSM) for modeling and central composite
rotatable design (CCRD) for design of experiments, mathematical models were
developed for fouling rate and protein (P1, P2) and carbohydrate (C1, C2)
concentrations in two layers of fouling. Results showed that sludge retention
time (SRT) was the most important variable in most models followed by aeration
rate. Aeration showed a more effective role on the models of the rinsed layer
(P1, C1) than backwashed layer (P2, C2). Backwashed layer had more influence on
total fouling rate than rinsed layer. The optimal point for MBR operation was:
SRT = 30 days, aeration = 10.7 L/min, relaxation interval = 8.8 minutes, and
relaxation duration = 41.8 seconds.
