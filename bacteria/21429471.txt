BACKGROUND: Colon preparation for elective colon resection to reduce surgical
site infection (SSI) remains controversial.
METHODS: A review of the published literature was undertaken to define
evidence-based practices for colon preparation for elective colon resection.
RESULTS: Seventy years of surgical literature has documented that mechanical
bowel preparation alone does not reduce SSI. A body of clinical trials has
documented the benefits of oral antibiotic bowel preparation compared with a
placebo in the reduction of SSI. Clinical trials show the addition of the oral
antibiotic bowel preparation to appropriate systemic preoperative preventive
antibiotics provide the lowest rates of SSI.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical bowel preparation alone does not reduce rates of SSI, but
oral antibiotic preparation and systemic preoperative antibiotics are superior
when compared with systemic antibiotics alone. Additional clinical trials are
necessary to define the best combined overall mechanical and oral antibiotic
regimen for elective colon surgery.
