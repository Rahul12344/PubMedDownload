Diarrhea-causing Escherichia coli strains are responsible for numerous cases of
gastrointestinal disease and constitute a serious health problem throughout the
world. The ability to recognize and attach to host intestinal surfaces is an
essential step in the pathogenesis of such strains. AIDA is a potent bacterial
adhesin associated with some diarrheagenic E. coli strains. AIDA mediates
bacterial attachment to a broad variety of human and other mammalian cells. It is
a surface-displayed autotransporter protein and belongs to the selected group of 
bacterial glycoproteins; only the glycosylated form binds to mammalian cells.
Here, we show that AIDA possesses self-association characteristics and can
mediate autoaggregation of E. coli cells. We demonstrate that intercellular
AIDA-AIDA interaction is responsible for bacterial autoaggregation.
Interestingly, AIDA-expressing cells can interact with antigen 43
(Ag43)-expressing cells, which is indicative of an intercellular AIDA-Ag43
interaction. Additionally, AIDA expression dramatically enhances biofilm
formation by E. coli on abiotic surfaces in flow chambers.
