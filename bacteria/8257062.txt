Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) A, B, C, DR, DQ and DP locus alleles in 35 Chinese 
patients with Graves' disease and 80 controls were typed for using serological
and DNA polymerase chain reaction/sequence specific oligonucleotide (PCR/SSO)
methods. B46 was found to be strongly associated with male patients (p = 0.0002; 
RR = 8.2, 95% confidence interval 2.1-32.2). In HLA class 1 alleles, besides B46,
the frequencies of A2 and Cw1 were increased and A24 and B63 decreased in
patients compared to controls. In HLA class 2 alleles, the frequencies of
DRB1*1602, *0301, *1405, DRB5*02, DQB1*0502 were increased and DRB1*1501,
DQB1*0301 decreased in patients.
