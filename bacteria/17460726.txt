Normal skin is often exposed to bacteria, including potent pathogens such as E.
coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sp., but these microbes usually do
not cause skin inflammation or infection in healthy individuals. Therefore, we
hypothesized that there must be a constitutive mechanism for rapid destruction
and elimination of small numbers of bacteria which penetrate the stratum corneum 
from everyday activities. This study found that exposure of keratinocytes
cultured from a number of individuals to S. aureus resulted in approximately 2-3 
log better killing than by HaCaT cells within 1 hour. Killing required contact
between the keratinocytes and the bacteria, but was not dependent on
internalization. Contact between the bacteria and the keratinocytes resulted in
rapid deposition of several antimicrobial peptides onto the bacteria, but only
human beta-defensin (HBD) 3 accumulated at levels sufficient to account for
killing when S. aureus were exposed to human skin explants. Blocking peptide
binding of HBD3 inhibited killing of the bacteria, indicating an essential role
for beta-defensin 3 in the constitutive killing of bacteria by normal
keratinocytes.
