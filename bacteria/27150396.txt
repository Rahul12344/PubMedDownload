OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to transfer the Salmonella genomic
islands (GIs) SGI1 and SGI1-V and the Proteus GI PGI1-PmESC to clinical isolates 
of Enterobacteriaceae harbouring an A/C2 plasmid.
METHODS: The entire genetic structures of SGI1 and PGI1-PmESC from Salmonella
Typhimurium and Proteus mirabilis, respectively, were characterized by PCR and
DNA sequencing. Ten enterobacterial isolates from different species carrying
blaTEM-24 on an A/C2 plasmid were used for the mobilization of SGI1: Escherichia 
coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,
Enterobacter aerogenes, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus
vulgaris, Providencia stuartii and Serratia marcescens. SGI1-V and PGI1-PmESC
were transferred to E. aerogenes. Conjugation attempts were also performed using 
the wild strain E. aerogenes BOL and E. coli K-12 with or without pA/C2.
Detection and location of the GI in the transconjugants were assessed by PCR
targeting their junctions.
RESULTS: The multidrug resistance region of PGI1-PmESC contained a class 1
integron (aadB and aadA2) and regions deriving from transposon Tn501 and a hybrid
Tn502/Tn5053 transposon, whereas SGI1 harboured the known determinants
responsible for the pentaresistance. The transfer of SGI1 occurred from
Salmonella Typhimurium to the 10 enterobacterial isolates, and transfer of SGI1-V
and PGI1-PmESC occurred from P. mirabilis to E. aerogenes. In all transconjugants
the GI was located at the 3'-end of trmE. SGI1 was also transferred to E.
aerogenes BOL (pA/C2) and E. coli K-12 (pA/C2), but not to E. aerogenes BOL and
E. coli K-12.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known description of SGI1 mobilization into a
broad range of enterobacterial species harbouring an A/C2 plasmid and the first
demonstration of PGI1 movement. The A/C2 plasmid is responsible for the GI
mobilization.
