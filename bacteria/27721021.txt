Inactivation of p53 occurs frequently in various cancers. RITA is a promising
anticancer small molecule that dissociates p53-MDM2 interaction, reactivates p53 
and induces exclusive apoptosis in cancer cells, but acquired RITA resistance
remains a major drawback. This study found that the site-differential
phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) RelA/p65 creates a barcode for RITA 
chemosensitivity in cancer cells. In naïve MCF7 and HCT116 cells where RITA
triggered vast apoptosis, phosphorylation of RelA/p65 increased at Ser536, but
decreased at Ser276 and Ser468; oppositely, in RITA-resistant cells, RelA/p65
phosphorylation decreased at Ser536, but increased at Ser276 and Ser468. A
phosphomimetic mutation at Ser536 (p65/S536D) or silencing of endogenous RelA/p65
resensitized the RITA-resistant cells to RITA while the phosphomimetic mutant at 
Ser276 (p65/S276D) led to RITA resistance of naïve cells. In mouse xenografts,
intratumoral delivery of the phosphomimetic p65/S536D mutant increased the
antitumor activity of RITA. Furthermore, in the RITA-resistant cells ATP-binding 
cassette transporter ABCC6 was upregulated, and silencing of ABCC6 expression in 
these cells restored RITA sensitivity. In the naïve cells, ABCC6 delivery led to 
RITA resistance and blockage of p65/S536D mutant-induced RITA sensitivity. Taken 
together, these data suggest that the site-differential phosphorylation of
RelA/p65 modulates RITA sensitivity in cancer cells, which may provide an avenue 
to manipulate RITA resistance.
