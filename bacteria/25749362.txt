Energy constraints have altered consumer practice regarding the use of household 
washing machines. Washing machines were developed that use lower washing
temperatures, smaller amounts of water and biodegradable detergents. These
conditions may favour the enrichment of opportunistic human pathogenic fungi. We 
focused on the isolation of fungi from two user-accessible parts of washing
machines that often contain microbial biofilms: drawers for detergents and rubber
door seals. Out of 70 residential washing machines sampled in Slovenia, 79% were 
positive for fungi. In total, 72 strains belonging to 12 genera and 26 species
were isolated. Among these, members of the Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani
species complexes, Candida parapsilosis and Exophiala phaeomuriformis represented
44% of fungi detected. These species are known as opportunistic human pathogens
and can cause skin, nail or eye infections also in healthy humans. A machine
learning analysis revealed that presence of detergents and softeners followed by 
washing temperature, represent most critical factors for fungal colonization.
Three washing machines with persisting malodour that resulted in bad smelling
laundry were analysed for the presence of fungi and bacteria. In these cases,
fungi were isolated in low numbers (7.5 %), while bacteria Micrococcus luteus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Sphingomonas species prevailed.
