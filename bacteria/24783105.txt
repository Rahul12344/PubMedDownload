Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare cutaneous malignant neoplasm
consisting of relatively monomorphous mononuclear spindle cells that show diffuse
CD34+ positivity. Management of this lesion poses problem because of its
infiltrative margins and high propensity for local recurrence and rare distant
metastasis. It is said that clear margins with minimal removal of normal tissues 
can be achieved by Mohs' micrographic surgery, which is particularly important in
head and neck locations where the presence of vital anatomical structures and
aesthetic considerations hinders a wide surgical excision. A case of DFSP, at a
very uncommon site of parotid region, which recurred within 9 months after
initial surgical treatment, is being reported.
