In this study, the effect of several organic nitrogen sources (namely peptone,
meat extract-ME, yeast extract-YE, and corn steep liquor-CSL) on D-lactic acid
production by Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. delbrueckii has been studied. While 
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are well-known for their complex nutritional
requirements, organic nitrogen source-related cost can be as high as 38% of total
operational costs (OPEX), being its nature and concentration critical factors in 
the growth and productivity of the selected strain. Corn steep liquor (CSL) has
been chosen for its adequacy, on the grounds of the D-lactic acid yield,
productivity, and its cost per kilogram of product. Finally, orange peel waste
hydrolysate supplemented with 37 g/l CSL has been employed for D-lactic acid
production, reaching a final yield of 88% and a productivity of 2.35 g/l h. CSL
cost has been estimated at 90.78$/ton of D-lactate.
