BACKGROUND: Epigenetic therapy using histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) has
shown promise in clinical trials for the treatment of human malignancies. In
addition to the immediate effects on the tumour cell growth, HDACi upregulates
the expression of MHC class I-related chain molecules A and B (MICA and MICB),
resulting in an enhanced susceptibility of tumour cells to natural killer
cell-mediated lysis. The molecular mechanism underlying is still unclear.
METHODS: The transcriptional regulation mechanism underlying suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid (SAHA)-mediated regulation of MICA and related miRNA expression
was investigated using promoter acetylation assays, bioinformatics analysis and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.
RESULTS: SAHA upregulates the transcription of MICA/B by promoting
MICA-associated histone acetylation while suppressing the MICA/B-targeting miRNAs
miR-20a, miR-93 and miR-106b. The mechanism by which SAHA repressed miRNAs
transcription involved repression of their host genes (miR-17-92 cluster and
MCM7). SAHA downregulated the miR-17-92 cluster by abolishing tyrosine
phosphorylation of STAT3 and decreased MCM7 transcription through localised
histone deacetylation.
CONCLUSIONS: The HDACi SAHA epigenetically upregulates MICA expression through
regulating the expression of miR-17-92 cluster and MCM7 in hepatoma, thus
enhancing the sensitivity of HCC to natural killer cell-mediated lysis. This
novel mechanism of action provides promise for HDACi in therapy of HCC.
