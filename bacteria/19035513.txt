OBJECTIVE: The immunologic events that lead to persistent joint inflammation in
certain patients with Lyme arthritis post-antibiotic treatment have been elusive 
so far. The prevalence of this condition is highest in individuals with
rheumatoid arthritis-associated HLA-DR alleles. This study was undertaken to
generate a murine model with persistent arthritis post-antibiotic treatment.
METHODS: We have previously shown that CD28(-/-) mice develop intermittent
monarticular Lyme arthritis that is responsive to antibiotics. Since there seems 
to be a link in humans between persistent arthritic manifestations
post-antibiotic treatment and the HLA-DR4 allele, we generated
DR4+/+CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, infected them with Borrelia burgdorferi, and
subsequently treated them with antibiotics.
RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent of the B burgdorferi-infected
DR4+/+CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, but none of the B burgdorferi-infected
CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, remained arthritic post-antibiotic treatment. A
significant fraction (36%) of these mice, but none of the mice in which arthritis
resolved, had serum antibodies to outer surface protein A of B burgdorferi. After
abrogation of active B burgdorferi infection, the inflammatory reaction in mice
with persistent joint inflammation was restricted to the joints, since their
draining lymph nodes were no longer enlarged. Increased CD20 and interferon-gamma
messenger RNA expression in the inflamed joints of these mice suggested a
possible role of B cells and inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of
persistent arthritis post-antibiotic treatment.
CONCLUSION: The establishment of this murine model allows, for the first time,
the elucidation of the immunologic events that lead to persistent Lyme arthritis 
post-antibiotic therapy in genetically susceptible individuals.
