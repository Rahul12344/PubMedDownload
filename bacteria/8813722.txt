Nuclear hormone receptors are the largest known family of eukaryotic
transcription factors and serve as critical effectors of vertebrate homeostasis, 
growth, and differentiation. The precise transcriptional response mediated by a
given nuclear hormone receptor is dictated by hormone, promoter, and cellular
context, and many nuclear hormone receptors function bimodally as both
transcriptional activators and repressors. We report here the identification of a
family of proteins, denoted TRACs (T3 receptor-associating cofactors), which
physically interact with nuclear hormone receptors and can modulate the
transcriptional properties of these receptors. TRACs associate with retinoic
acid, retinoid X, and thyroid hormone receptors, as well as the PML-RAR alpha and
v-Erb A oncoproteins. Certain TRAC forms attenuate target gene expression and may
serve as corepressors, whereas other TRAC family members appear to counteract
these effects. We suggest that TRACs and related cofactors may participate in
dictating the pleiotropic transcriptional capacities of the nuclear hormone
receptors.
