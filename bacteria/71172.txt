In experiments conducted on guinea pigs the sensitizing activity of Neisseria
perflava isolated from the mucous membranes of the bronchi of patients with
infectious asthma was studied. A possibility of reproducing active skin
anaphylaxis after Ovary and of the contraction-test of the tracheal-chain by the 
neisseria antigens was shown. Neisseria perflava was found to possess a greater
sensitizing activity than Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae
inhabiting the bronchi of patients with infectious asthma.
