Type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) are the condensing enzymes that catalyze the
formation of a myriad of aromatic polyketides in plant, bacteria, and fungi. Here
we report the cloning and characterization of a putative type III PKS from
Aspergillusniger, AnPKS. This enzyme catalyzes the synthesis of alkyl pyrones
from C2 to C18 starter CoA thioesters with malonyl-CoA as an extender CoA through
decaboxylative condensation and cyclization. It displays broad substrate
specificity toward fatty acyl-CoA starters to yield triketide and tetraketide
pyrones, with benzoyl-CoA as the most preferred starter. The optimal temperature 
and pH of AnPKS are 50°C and 8, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the
enzyme shows the highest catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of
7.4×10(5)s(-1)M(-1) toward benzoyl-CoA. Homology modeling and site-directed
mutagenesis were used to probe the molecular basis of its substrate specificity. 
This study should open doors for further engineering of AnPKS as a biocatalyst
for synthesis of value-added polyketides.
