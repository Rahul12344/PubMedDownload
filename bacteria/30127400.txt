Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) is a crucial transcription factor in the signal
transduction cascade of the inflammatory signaling. Activation of NF-κB depends
on the phosphorylation of IκBα by IκB kinase (IKKβ) followed by subsequent
ubiquitination and degradation. This leads to the nuclear translocation of the
p50- p65 subunits of NF-κB, and further triggers pro-inflammatory cytokine gene
expression. Thus, in the need of a more effective therapy for the treatment of
inflammatory diseases, specific inhibition of IKKβ represents a rational
alternative strategy to the current therapies. A computer-aided drug
identification protocol was followed to identify novel IKKβ inhibitors from a
database of over 1500 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drugs. The best scoring 
compounds were compared with the already known high-potency IKKβ inhibitors for
their ability to bind and inhibit IKKβ by evaluating their docking energy.
Finally, Thioridazinehydrochloride (TDZ), a potent antipsychotic drug against
Schizophrenia was selected and its efficiency in inhibiting IκBα protein
degradation and NF-κB activation was experimentally validated. Our study has
demonstrated that TDZ blocks IκBα protein degradation and subsequent NF-κB
activation to inhibit inflammation. Thus, it is a potential repurposed drug
against inflammation.
