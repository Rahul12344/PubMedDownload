Severe adverse drug reactions (ADR) of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic
epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) in some patients receiving strontium ranelate have
been reported, but the risk factors are unclear. We show that HLA-A*33:03 and
B*58:01 are significantly associated with patients who developed SJS/TEN; and
provide the first evidence that genetic risk factors are involved in strontium
ranelate-associated SJS/TEN.INTRODUCTION: In this study, HLA as a genetic risk
factor was assessed among osteoporotic patients prescribed with strontium
ranelate that developed severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) compared 
with those who were tolerant.
METHODS: Genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 
patients was HLA typed using sequencing-based typing method to determine their
HLA profiles.
RESULTS: Osteoporotic patients who are currently on strontium ranelate were
enrolled in the study (n = 76). Tolerant controls were defined as patients who
received strontium ranelate for a minimum of 3 months (range 3 months to 8 years)
with no reports of any cutaneous reactions as these reactions usually occur
within the first 12 weeks after starting treatment. Retrospective cases of
SJS/TEN were also identified (n = 5). The majority of the accrued samples were of
Han Chinese descent: controls (n = 72) and cases (n = 4). All cases and controls 
were genotyped at four HLA genes, namely HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. In
comparing the samples of Han Chinese descent (72 controls and 4 cases), we found 
significant associations with HLA-A*33:03 (p = 0.002) and HLA-B*58:01
(p = 0.023). There was no significant association with any HLA-C or HLA-DRB1
alleles.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that the occurrence of SJS/TEN in Han Chinese
patients receiving strontium ranelate is HLA associated. This has important
clinical implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms for this ADR as
well as evaluating the potential role of genetic pre-screening for osteoporotic
patients who may be prescribed strontium ranelate.
