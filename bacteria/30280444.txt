INTRODUCTION: Strigolactones (SLs) are the most representative germination
stimulants for seeds of root parasitic plants, and they show activity even at
concentrations below 10-10  M. The low amounts of stimulants produced by the host
and their rapid degradability make it crucial to develop analytical methods with 
very low limits of quantification.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a sensitive and validated analytical method for the
simultaneous quantification of seven SLs [7-oxoorobanchyl acetate (1), solanacol 
(2), orobanchol (4), strigol (5), fabacyl acetate (6), orobanchyl acetate (7),
and 5-deoxystrigol (8)].
METHODS: SLs were analysed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), with (±)-GR24 (3) employed as 
internal standard (IS). Validation was based on selectivity, linearity, precision
of the peak areas (repeatability and intermediate precision), detection and
quantification limits, and stability.
RESULTS: A simple, rapid and reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method has been validated for
the routine analysis of seven SLs and has been successfully applied to quantify
them in exudates and extracts from tomato roots (Solanum lycopersicum). The
limits of quantifications range from 0.05 μg/L for 5-deoxystrigol to 0.96 μg/L
for solanacol.
CONCLUSION: The method provides a useful tool for research in all the fields
related to SLs, both for studies related to their function as hormones, and
signalling molecules in the rhizosphere, without sample preparation required for 
extracts and root exudates in less than 11 minutes.
