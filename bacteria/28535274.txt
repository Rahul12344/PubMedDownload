Development of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is associated with
OprD polymorphisms, particularly the amino acid substitution at codon 170.

Objectives: Pan-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSPA) clinical isolates
carrying an OprD with loop 7 shortening (the group-1A allele) were found to
rapidly develop carbapenem resistance under continuous selection pressure. We
further studied whether OprD polymorphisms are associated with the potential to
develop carbapenem resistance.
Methods: OprD amino acid sequences of 126 PSPA clinical isolates were analysed to
determine their STs using P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 as the control strain.
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in PAO1 to generate polymorphisms of
interest. A disc diffusion method was used to select carbapenem-resistant
variants from the mutant strains. Expression levels of oprD were determined by
quantitative RT-PCR. MICs of carbapenems were determined by Etest.
Results: Forty-eight (38.1%) of the tested isolates carried the group-1A allele. 
Another two major STs, C1 and C2, both of which harboured an F170L polymorphism, 
were found in 21 (16.7%) and 39 (31.0%) isolates, respectively. The PAO1 type was
also found in 14 (11.1%) isolates. Under continuous selective pressure, isolates 
of most STs developed carbapenem resistance at different numbers of passaging
events; only those belonging to the PAO1 type remained susceptible. However, PAO1
mutants carrying either the oprD group-1A allele or the OprD-F170L polymorphism
were able to develop carbapenem resistance. Reduced oprD expression triggered by 
continuous imipenem challenge was found in PAO1 mutants, but not in the PAO1 WT
strain.
Conclusions: OprD polymorphisms, particularly the F170L substitution and the
specific shortening in loop 7, appear to determine the potential for P.
aeruginosa to develop carbapenem resistance.
