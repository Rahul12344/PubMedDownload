Solitary fibrous tumor is a mesenchymal tumor that was initially described as a
pleural-based lesion, but later was discovered in many other locations. The
light-microscopic appearance of solitary fibrous tumor may overlap with other
diagnostic entities; however, consistent tumor cell CD34 immunoreactivity is
useful in establishing the diagnosis. Limited data suggest that solitary fibrous 
tumors are karyotypically diverse, and no common or characteristic anomaly has
yet emerged for this entity. Cytogenetic analysis of two solitary fibrous tumors,
one peritoneal and the other arising in the liver, revealed predominantly
structural abnormalities in the former and numerical imbalances in the latter.
Clonal karyotypic abnormalities were lacking in three additional solitary fibrous
tumors.
