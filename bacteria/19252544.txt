CASE HISTORY: Two young, large-breed female dogs were presented with an acute
onset of sneezing and nasal discharge. One patient had concurrent epistaxis and
facial deformity.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: Decreased airflow was noted through the left nostril in Case
1, while Case 2 showed facial deformity. Nasal radiographs from Case 1 showed a
soft tissue opacity in the left nasal cavity and frontal sinus. Rhinoscopy
revealed roughened, erythematous nasal turbinates in both patients, and a mass in
the left caudal nasal cavity of Case 1. Cryptococcus spp. were demonstrated
histopathologically on a nasal biopsy. Tissue culture and serum antigen titres
were positive for Cryptococcus spp.
DIAGNOSIS: Chronic rhinitis secondary to Cryptococcus gattii infection in Case 1,
and Cryptococcus neoformans infection in Case 2.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These are the first reported cases of Cryptococcus spp.
rhinitis in dogs in New Zealand.
