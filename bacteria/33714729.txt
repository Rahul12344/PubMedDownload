Myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can be subset into monocytic (M-),
granulocytic (G-) or polymorphonuclear (PMN-), and immature (i-) or early MDSCs
and have a role in many disease states. In cancer patients, the frequencies of
MDSCs can positively correlate with stage, grade, and survival. Most clinical
studies into MDSCs have been undertaken with peripheral blood (PB); however, in
the present studies, we uniquely examined MDSCs in the spleens and PB from
patients with gastrointestinal cancers. In our studies, MDSCs were rigorously
subset using the following markers: Lineage (LIN) (CD3, CD19 and CD56), human
leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR, CD11b, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD45, and CD16. We
observed a significantly higher frequency of PMN- and M-MDSCs in the PB of cancer
patients as compared to their spleens. Expression of the T-cell suppressive
enzymes arginase (ARG1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) were higher
on all MDSC subsets for both cancer patients PB and spleen cells as compared to
MDSCs from the PB of normal donors. Similar findings for the activation markers
lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), program death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) and program cell death protein 1 (PD-1) were observed.
Interestingly, the total MDSC cell number exported to clustering analyses was
similar between all sample types; however, clustering analyses of these MDSCs,
using these markers, uniquely documented novel subsets of PMN-, M- and i-MDSCs.
In summary, we report a comparison of splenic MDSC frequency, subtypes, and
functionality in cancer patients to their PB by clustering and cytometric
analyses.
