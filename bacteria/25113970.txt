The bZIP transcription factor Nfil3 (also known as E4BP4) is required for the
development of natural killer (NK) cells and type 1 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC1s). We find that Nfil3 plays a critical role in the development of other
mucosal tissue-associated innate lymphocytes. Type 3 ILCs (ILC3s), including
lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi)-like cells, are severely diminished in both numbers
and function in Nfil3-deficient mice. Using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, we
demonstrate that Nfil3 is critical for normal development of gut-associated ILC3s
in a cell-intrinsic manner. Furthermore, Nfil3 deficiency severely compromises
intestinal innate immune defense against acute bacterial infection with
Citrobacter rodentium and Clostridium difficile. Nfil3 deficiency resulted in a
loss of the recently identified ILC precursor, yet conditional ablation of Nfil3 
in the NKp46(+) ILC3 subset did not perturb ILC3 numbers, suggesting that Nfil3
is required early during ILC3 development but not for lineage maintenance.
Lastly, a marked defect in type 2 ILCs (ILC2s) was also observed in the lungs and
visceral adipose tissue of Nfil3-deficient mice, revealing a general requirement 
for Nfil3 in the development of all ILC lineages.
