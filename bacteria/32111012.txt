The skin microbiota plays a prominent role in health and disease; however, its
contribution to skin tumorigenesis is not well understood. We comparatively
assessed the microbial community compositions from excision specimens of the main
human non-melanoma skin cancers, actinic keratosis (AK), squamous cell carcinoma 
(SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Keratinocyte skin tumors are characterized 
by significantly different microbial community compositions, wherein AK and SCC
are more similar to each other than to BCC. Notably, in SCC, which represents the
advanced tumor entity and frequently develops from AK, overabundance of
Staphylococcus aureus, a known skin pathogen, was noted. Moreover, S. aureus
overabundance was significantly associated with increased human β-defensin-2
(hBD-2) expression in SCC. By challenging human SCC cell lines with S. aureus, a 
specific induction of hBD-2 expression and increased tumor cell growth was seen. 
Increased proliferation was also induced by directly challenging SCC cells with
hBD-2. Together, our data indicate that a changed microbial community composition
in SCC, specified by S. aureus overabundance, might promote tumor cell growth via
modulation of hBD-2 expression.
