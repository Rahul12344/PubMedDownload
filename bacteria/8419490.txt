Ra-reactive factor (RaRF) is a C-dependent bactericidal factor that binds
specifically to LPS of Ra chemotype strains of Salmonella and kills the bacteria 
by triggering the C cascade. In the present study, we investigated the components
of mouse RaRF that activate C4 and C2. The RaRF bound to LPS-coated E, and
activated the C4 on the surface of E, causing the C4 to bind to the cells.
Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) bound to RaRF and inhibited its ability to
activate C4 and C2. Cleavage of the alpha-chain of C4 by RaRF generated a
polypeptide with a size similar to that of the alpha'-chain of C4b, which is
known to be a product of the cleavage of C4 by C1s subcomponent of C1. A fraction
with the ability to activate C4 and C2 was separated from RaRF by gel-permeation 
chromatography in the presence of EDTA and acetonitrile. This fraction contained 
a DFP-binding polypeptide with an apparent m.w. of 100,000. This polypeptide is
not the C1s in mouse C1 because the sizes of this polypeptide and of the
fragments produced by its reduction were different from those of DFP-binding
proteinases in mouse C1. These results indicate that mouse RaRF contains a
C1s-like serine proteinase that is capable of activating C4 and, probably, C2.
