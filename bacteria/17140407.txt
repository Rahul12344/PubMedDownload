The signalling pathway for the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, Met/HGF-R, is
hijacked by the bacterial surface protein InlB to induce Listeria monocytogenes
entry into non-phagocytic cells. We previously showed that Listeria invades host 
cells by interacting with specialized microdomains of the host plasma membrane
called lipid rafts. In this study, we analysed in living cells signalling events 
that are crucial for Listeria entry using a fluorescence resonance energy
transfer-based microscopic method. Phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase activity and
Rac1 signalling induced by Listeria interacting with epithelial cells were
monitored as well as signalling induced by soluble InlB and the Met natural
ligand HGF. We found that InlB and HGF induced similar kinetics of PI 3-kinase
and Rac1 activation. PI 3-kinase activation was upstream and independent of Rac1 
activation. Cholesterol-depletion experiments were performed to address the role 
of lipid rafts in Met signalling. The amount of 3'-phosphoinositides produced by 
PI 3-kinase was not affected by cholesterol depletion, while their membrane
dynamic was cholesterol-dependent. Rac1 activation, downstream from PI 3-kinase, 
was cholesterol-dependent suggesting that the spatial distribution of
3'-phosphoinositides within membrane microdomains is critical for Rac1 activation
and consequently for F-actin assembly at bacterial entry site.
