Lyme disease, or Lyme borreliosis, the most prevalent arthropod-borne disease in 
the Western world, is caused by spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi
sensu lato group and is predominantly transmitted through Ixodes ticks. There is 
currently no vaccine available to prevent Lyme borreliosis in humans. Borrelia
outer membrane proteins are reviewed which have been investigated as vaccine
candidates. In addition, several tick proteins are discussed, on which anti-tick 
vaccines have been based, or are interesting future candidates, to prevent
transmission of the spirochete from the tick vector to the mammalian host.
Finally, novel vaccination strategies to prevent Lyme borreliosis are proposed,
based on multiple Borrelia antigens, tick antigens or a combination of both
Borrelia as well as tick antigens.
