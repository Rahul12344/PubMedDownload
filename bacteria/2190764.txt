Enteric infections are a major cause of diarrhea in the United States. Pathogens 
can cause diarrhea by elaboration of toxins that affect the intestinal mucosa or 
by direct invasion of the intestinal wall. Clinical evaluation can provide
important clues to aid in establishing a correct diagnosis in most patients with 
infectious enteritis. Appropriate cultures are necessary to confirm the diagnosis
in most cases. Most types of infectious enteritis are self-limiting, but some
pathogens can cause serious disease, requiring accurate diagnosis and suitable
antibiotic therapy. Appropriate precautions are mandatory to prevent the spread
of infectious diarrhea from occurring in the hospital environment. Dietary
restrictions and appropriate hygiene should be observed during travel to foreign 
countries to reduce the chance of acquiring infectious enteritis.
