In this study, we designed and synthesized three N-terminal deletion analogs of
human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3), namely, hBD-3Δ4, hBD-3Δ7, and hBD-3Δ10, to
determine the effect of N-terminal residues on the antibacterial activity and
salt resistance of these peptides. The antibacterial activities and salt
resistance of hBD-3 and its analogs were tested against a broad range of standard
and clinically isolated strains. The deletion of nine N-terminal residues
significantly reduced the antibacterial activity of hBD-3 against most of tested 
strains, particularly Klebsiella pneumonia. Compared with hBD-3 and other
analogs, the analog with a deletion of three residues, hBD-3Δ4, exhibited
significantly higher antimicrobial activity against almost all the tested
strains, especially Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium, at high NaCl
concentrations. Given its broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and high salt 
resistance, hBD-3Δ4 could serve as a promising template for new therapeutic
antimicrobial agents.
