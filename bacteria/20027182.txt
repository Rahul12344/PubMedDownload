Reprogramming of somatic cell nuclei to yield induced pluripotent stem (iPS)
cells makes possible derivation of patient-specific stem cells for regenerative
medicine. However, iPS cell generation is asynchronous and slow (2-3 weeks), the 
frequency is low (<0.1%), and DNA demethylation constitutes a bottleneck. To
determine regulatory mechanisms involved in reprogramming, we generated
interspecies heterokaryons (fused mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and human
fibroblasts) that induce reprogramming synchronously, frequently and fast. Here
we show that reprogramming towards pluripotency in single heterokaryons is
initiated without cell division or DNA replication, rapidly (1 day) and
efficiently (70%). Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown showed that
activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID, also known as AICDA) is required for 
promoter demethylation and induction of OCT4 (also known as POU5F1) and NANOG
gene expression. AID protein bound silent methylated OCT4 and NANOG promoters in 
fibroblasts, but not active demethylated promoters in ES cells. These data
provide new evidence that mammalian AID is required for active DNA demethylation 
and initiation of nuclear reprogramming towards pluripotency in human somatic
cells.
