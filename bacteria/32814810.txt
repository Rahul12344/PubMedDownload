Antenna systems serve to absorb light and to transmit excitation energy to the
reaction center (RC) in photosynthetic organisms. As the emitted
(bacterio)chlorophyll fluorescence competes with the photochemical utilization of
the excitation, the measured fluorescence yield is informed by the migration of
the excitation in the antenna. In this work, the fluorescence yield concomitant
with the oxidized dimer (P+) of the RC were measured during light excitation
(induction) and relaxation (in the dark) for whole cells of photosynthetic
bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides lacking cytochrome c2 as natural electron donor
to P+ (mutant cycA). The relationship between the fluorescence yield and P+
(fraction of closed RC) showed deviations from the standard
Joliot-Lavergne-Trissl model: (1) the hyperbola is not symmetric and (2) exhibits
hysteresis. These phenomena originate from the difference between the delays of
fluorescence relative to P+ kinetics during induction and relaxation, and in
structural terms from the non-random distribution of the closed RCs during
induction. The experimental findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations and
by results from statistical physics based on random walk approximations of the
excitation in the antenna. The applied mathematical treatment demonstrates the
generalization of the standard theory and sets the stage for a more adequate
description of the long-debated kinetics of fluorescence and of the delicate
control and balance between efficient light harvest and photoprotection in
photosynthetic organisms.
