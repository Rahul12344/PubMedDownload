Ongoing clinical trials for treatment of beta-globinopathies by gene therapy
involve the transfer of the beta-globin gene, which requires integration of three
to four copies per genome in most target cells. This high proviral load may
increase genome toxicity, potentially limiting the safety of this therapy and
relegating its use to total body myeloablation. We hypothesized that introducing 
an additional hypersensitive site from the locus control region, the complete
sequence of the second intron of the beta-globin gene, and the ankyrin insulator 
may enhance beta-globin expression. We identified a construct, ALS20, that
synthesized significantly higher adult hemoglobin levels than those of other
constructs currently used in clinical trials. These findings were confirmed in
erythroblastic cell lines and in primary cells isolated from sickle cell disease 
patients. Bone marrow transplantation studies in beta-thalassemia mice revealed
that ALS20 was curative at less than one copy per genome. Injection of human
CD34+ cells transduced with ALS20 led to safe, long-term, and high polyclonal
engraftment in xenograft experiments. Successful treatment of beta-globinopathies
with ALS20 could potentially be achieved at less than two copies per genome,
minimizing the risk of cytotoxic events and lowering the intensity of
myeloablation.
