Induction of pneumonia in C57Bl/6 mice by intranasal inoculation with 10(6) cfu
of Streptococcus pneumoniae resulted in sustained expression of interleukin
(IL)-6 mRNA in lungs and increases in lung and plasma IL-6 concentrations. In
IL-6-deficient (IL-6-/-) mice, pneumonia was associated with higher lung levels
of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1beta, and
interferon-gamma and of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 than in wild type
(IL-6+/+) mice (all P < .05). Also, the plasma concentrations of soluble tumor
necrosis factor receptors were higher in IL-6-/- mice (P < .05), while the
acute-phase protein response was strongly attenuated (P < .01). Lungs harvested
from IL-6-/- mice 40 h after inoculation contained more S. pneumoniae colonies (P
< .05). IL-6-/- mice died significantly earlier from pneumococcal pneumonia than 
did IL-6+/+ mice (P < .05). During pneumococcal pneumonia, IL-6 down-regulates
the activation of the cytokine network in the lung and contributes to host
defense.
