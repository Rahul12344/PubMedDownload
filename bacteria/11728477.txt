We recently showed that FliC of Salmonella enteritidis increased human
beta-defensin-2 (hBD-2) expression, and now describe the signaling responsible
pathway. FliC increased the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](in)) in 
Caco-2 cells. The [Ca(2+)](in) increase induced by FliC was prevented by U73122
and heparin, but not by chelating extracellular Ca(2+) or pertussis toxin. The
FliC-induced increase in hBD-2 promoter activity via nuclear factor kappaB
(NF-kappaB) was also inhibited by chelation of intracellular Ca(2+) or by U73122.
We conclude that FliC increased [Ca(2+)](in) via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate,
which was followed by up-regulating hBD-2 mRNA expression via an
NF-kappaB-dependent pathway.
