Sequence type 131 (ST131) is a predominant lineage among extraintestinal
pathogenic Escherichia coli. It plays a major role in the worldwide dissemination
of E. coli producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). Here we describe the
long-term epidemiology of this clonal group in a French university hospital,
where the incidence of ESBL-producing E. coli has increased from 0.018 case per
1000 patient-days in the year 2000 to 0.50 case per 1000 patient-days in 2014.
The first of the 141 ST131 isolates was recovered in 2006, and the ST131 clonal
group accounted for 18.1% of total ESBL-producing E. coli over the whole period
(2000-2014). Subclonal typing showed that 75.9% (107/141) of ST131 isolates were 
H30, of which 81.3% (87/107) were H30-Rx. The large majority (137/141) of ESBLs
produced were of the CTX-M group, with 94 CTX-M-15, 19 CTX-M-1, 10 CTX-M-27, 8
CTX-M-14 and four other CTX-M types (n = 6). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) analysis showed high diversity, which increased during the course of the
study. The 141 ST131 isolates clustered in 53 pulsotypes (PTs), with 2 dominant
PTs (PT14 and PT13) with 36 and 17 isolates, respectively. These findings showed 
that ST131 was a predominant clone among ESBL-producing E. coli in our hospital, 
even though it only accounted for <20%. Moreover, ST131 should be regarded not as
a unified entity but as a cluster of distinct clonal subsets even if the increase
in resistance within ST131 has a strong clonal basis, being attributable mainly
to the spread of C1/H30-R and C2/H30-Rx clades.
