CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN) act as powerful adjuvant during in
vivo induction of T cell responses. While CpG-ODN directly activate
antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thus exert an extrinsic activity on T cells,
it is unclear whether they directly affect T cells (intrinsic activity). Here we 
analyze the effects of CpG-ODN on T cells in an APC-free cell culture. We report 
that CpG-ODN co-stimulate T cells provided they were triggered via their TCR.
CpG-ODN induced IL-2 production, IL-2 receptor expression and thus proliferation.
Proliferation was blocked by cyclosporin A or anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) but not by anti-IL-4 mAb. Moreover, CpG-co-stimulated T cells
differentiated into cytolytic T lymphocytes in vitro. Of note, IL-2-driven growth
of primed T cells was not affected by CpG-ODN. Co-stimulation was also operative 
in T cells from CD28-/- mice and in TCR-transgenic T cells stimulated with
peptide. CpG-ODN-mediated co-stimulation of T cells in vitro may thus explain
part of the potent adjuvant effects of CpG-ODN in vivo.
