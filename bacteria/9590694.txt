Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that was initially recognized as a regulator
of immune and inflammatory responses, but it also regulates the growth of many
tumour cells, including prostrate carcinoma. Overexpression of the growth-factor 
receptors ErbB2/neu and ErbB3 has been implicated in the neoplastic
transformation of prostate carcinoma. Here we show that treatment of the prostate
cancer cell line LNCaP with IL-6 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2 and
ErbB3, but not ErbB1/EGFR. We also show that ErbB2 forms a complex with the gp130
subunit of the IL-6 receptor in an IL-6-dependent manner. This association is
important because the inhibition of ErbB2 activity results in abrogation of
IL-6-induced MAPK activation. Thus ErbB2 is a critical component of IL-6
signalling through the MAP kinase pathway. These data show how a cytokine
receptor can diversify its signalling pathways by engaging with a growth-factor
receptor kinase.
