BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment in
multiple myeloma (MM). Blood grafts are usually collected after mobilization with
granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone or in a combination with
cyclophosphamide (CY). There is limited knowledge of the possible effects of
different mobilization regimens on blood graft characteristics and posttransplant
outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with MM were included in this
study. The patients were randomly assigned at registration to mobilization with
either low-dose CY plus G-CSF (Arm A) or G-CSF alone (Arm B) and received three
cycles of lenalidomide, bortetzomib, and dexamethasone induction. Flow cytometry 
analysis of lymphocyte subsets in the blood grafts after cryopreservation was
performed. Hematologic and immune recovery were evaluated up to 12 months
posttransplant.
RESULTS: The blood grafts in Arm A contained significantly more CD34+ cells but
in Arm B there was a greater proportion of CD34+CD38- cells and higher numbers of
T and B lymphocytes as well as natural killer (NK) cells. The engraftment was
comparable but lymphocyte count at 15 days posttransplant was higher in Arm B
(0.8 × 10(9) /L vs. 0.5 × 10(9) /L, p = 0.033). At 3 and 6 months posttransplant 
the total number of NK cells was also higher in G-CSF-mobilized patients. There
was no difference in progression-free survival between the study arms.
CONCLUSION: CY plus G-GSF yields more CD34+ cells but seems to diminish
lymphocyte and NK cell counts in the grafts and hampers immune recovery after
transplantation. Thus G-CSF alone might be a preferred mobilization method due to
more rapid immune recovery posttransplant.
