To define whether individual human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I allotypes are 
used preferentially in human cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific cytotoxic T
lymphocyte responses, CD8+ T cell responses restricted by up to six HLA class I
allotypes in an individual were measured in parallel using K562-based artificial 
antigen-presenting cells expressing both CMV pp65 antigen and one of 32 HLA class
I allotypes (7 HLA-A, 14 HLA-B, and 11 HLA-C) present in 50 healthy Korean
donors. The CD8+ T cell responses to pp65 in the HLA-C allotypes were lower than 
responses to those in HLA-A and -B allotypes and there was no difference between 
the HLA-A and HLA-B loci. HLA-A*02:01, -B*07:02, and -C*08:01 showed the highest 
magnitude and frequency of immune responses to pp65 at each HLA class I locus.
However, HLA-A*02:07, -B*59:01, -B*58:01, -B*15:11, -C*03:02, and -C*02:02 did
not show any immune responses. Although each individual has up to six different
HLA allotypes, 46% of the donors showed one allotype, 24% showed two allotypes,
and 2% showed three allotypes that responded to pp65. Interestingly, the
frequencies of HLA-A alleles were significantly correlated with the positivity of
specific allotypes. Our results demonstrate that specific HLA class I allotypes
are preferentially used in the CD8+ T cell immune response to pp65 and that a
hierarchy among HLA class I allotypes is present in an individual.
