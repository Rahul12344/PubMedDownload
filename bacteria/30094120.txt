It is well known that dietary lactic acid bacteria (LAB) stimulate cell-mediated 
immunity such as natural killer (NK) activity in mice. Here, we aimed to assay
the immunomodulatory effects of a cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis
strain KH-2 (CPEF). We further evaluated the possibility of antitumour activity
caused by CPEF administration, because NK cells actively participate in the
prevention of tumour formation. NK cell activity and gene expression of IFN-γ and
Perforin 1, which were induced most likely by a synergetic action of their
cytotoxic activity, were higher in splenocytes of CPEF-administered mice than
they were in control mice. Moreover, unlike those of control mice, the
splenocytes of CPEF-administered mice had significantly higher CD28+CD69+/CD4+
and CD28+CD69+/CD8+ ratios that resulted in a survival rate with a tendency
toward improvement after 47 days of CPEF administration (p=0.1) in Meth-A
fibrosarcoma-bearing mice. In conclusion, we showed that CPEF might be effective 
in treating Meth-A fibrosarcoma in mice, as it helped increase their survival
rate via stimulation of an immune response in splenocytes, which involved
systemic cellular immunity processes such as cytotoxic activity, and active T
cells.
