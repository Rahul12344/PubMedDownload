Gastric adenocarcinoma cells secrete sulfomucins, but their role in gastric
tumorigenesis remains unclear. To address that question, we generated A4gnt/Chst4
double-knockout (DKO) mice by crossing A4gnt knockout (KO) mice, which
spontaneously develop gastric adenocarcinoma, with Chst4 KO mice, which are
deficient in the sulfotransferase GlcNAc6ST-2. A4gnt/Chst4 DKO mice lack gastric 
sulfomucins but developed gastric adenocarcinoma. Unexpectedly, severe gastric
erosion occurred in A4gnt/Chst4 DKO mice at as early as 3 weeks of age, and with 
aging these lesions were accompanied by gastritis cystica profunda (GCP). Cxcl1, 
Cxcl5, Ccl2, and Cxcr2 transcripts in gastric mucosa of 5-week-old A4gnt/Chst4
DKO mice exhibiting both hyperplasia and severe erosion were significantly
upregulated relative to age-matched A4gnt KO mice, which showed hyperplasia
alone. However, upregulation of these genes disappeared in 50-week-old
A4gnt/Chst4 DKO mice exhibiting high-grade dysplasia/adenocarcinoma and GCP.
Moreover, Cxcl1 and Cxcr2 were downregulated in A4gnt/Chst4 DKO mice relative to 
age-matched A4gnt KO mice exhibiting adenocarcinoma alone. These combined results
indicate that the presence of sulfomucins prevents severe gastric erosion
followed by GCP in A4gnt KO mice by transiently regulating a set of
inflammation-related genes, Cxcl1, Cxcl5, Ccl2, and Cxcr2 at 5 weeks of age,
although sulfomucins were not directly associated with gastric cancer
development.
