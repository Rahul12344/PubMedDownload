We report a case of purple urine bag syndrome, associated to Streptococcus
agalactiae urinary tract infection, progressing to septic shock and death. We
present a review of the literature on the subject and take the opportunity to
attend readers about increasing incidence with population aging and its potential
bad outcome.
