Two clones of the K562 human leukemic cell line were isolated according to
hemoglobin (Hb) expression. One clone was expressed less than 5% (K562-L) and the
other more than 90% (K562-H). The two clones did not exhibit any difference in
cell growth or cell cycle. However, the Hb expression of K562-H cells was reduced
by succinylacetone (S.A.). The above results suggested that the difference in the
Hb production of K562-L and K562-H cells depended on the heme synthetic activity.
On the other hand, glycophorin A was expressed to a greater extent on K562-L
cells than on K562-H cells. These findings suggested that heme synthesis and the 
expression of glycophorin A on K562 cells were not always related. The CD11b and 
the CD61 were also expressed to a greater extent on K562-L cells than on K562-H
cells, but the CD34 was not expressed on these cells.
