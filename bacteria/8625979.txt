Evidence that induction of tolerance in vivo involves active signaling via a B7
ligand-dependent mechanism: CTLA4-Ig protects V beta 8+ T cells from tolerance
induction by the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B.

Co-stimulation through CD28 is thought to be necessary for the activation of
unprimed CD4+ T cells, which are otherwise rendered tolerant. However, we
previously found that CD4+ T cell priming was normal or augmented in mice which
overexpressed a soluble form of CTLA4 where co-stimulation through CD28 was
abrogated. To investigate this CD4+ T cell response, we exploited the capacity of
the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B to stimulate T lymphocytes bearing 
V beta 8+, which represent approximately 30% of all CD4+ T cells. In litter-mate 
controls of CTLA4-Ig transgenic mice, immunization with staphylococcal
enterotoxin B leads to expansion, followed by deletion of V beta 8+ T cells, and 
the remaining cells are tolerant when stimulated in vitro. Comparable expansion
and deletion of V beta 8 T cells occurs in CTLA4-Ig transgenic mice. However, in 
contrast to normal mice, the remaining V beta 8+ T cells from CTLA4-Ig transgenic
mice are not anergic and remain responsive to superantigen in vitro.
