We report the discovery of HD5-CD, an unprecedented C2-symmetric β-barrel-like
covalent dimer of the cysteine-rich host-defense peptide human defensin 5 (HD5). 
Dimerization results from intermonomer disulfide exchange between the canonical
α-defensin Cys(II)-Cys(IV) (Cys(5)-Cys(20)) bonds located at the hydrophobic
interface. This disulfide-locked dimeric assembly provides a new element of
structural diversity for cysteine-rich peptides as well as increased protease
resistance, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and enhanced potency against
the opportunistic human pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii.
