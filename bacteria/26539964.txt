BACKGROUND: To comparatively evaluate long-term prognostic values of fibrotic
biomarkers galectin-3, gremlin-1 and osteopontin in patients presenting to the
emergency department (ED) suspected of acute heart failure (AHF).
METHODS: Patients with acute dyspnea or peripheral edema were enrolled in the ED.
Biomarkers were measured and added to prognostic models including 11 conventional
risk factors plus NT-proBNP assessing state-of-the-art statistics of
discrimination, calibration, reclassification and Cox regression analyses.
Prognostic outcomes were long-term all-cause mortality (ACM) and AHF-related
rehospitalization (AHF-RH) at 1 and 5 years.
RESULTS: 401 patients including 122 AHF patients were enrolled (mean age 67
years, males 51%). During 5 years follow-up 129 patients (30%) died and 73 (18%) 
were re-hospitalized because of AHF. In multivariate analysis, galectin-3 (hazard
ratios (HR) range 1.4–1.9; p = 0.03) and osteopontin (HR range 1.2–1.4; p =
0.001) remained associated with ACM overall and in the AHF population at 5 years,
whereas gremlin-1 remained associated with AHF-RH at 1 year in AHF patients (HR
1.3; p = 0.002). ACM in whole cohort was best discriminated (AUC = 0.85, p =
0.0001), calibrated and re-classified (NRI + 0.50 to + 0.56, p = 0.0001) by
galectin-3, whereas in AHF patients ACM was best discriminated by osteopontin
(AUC range: 0.82–0.84, p = 0.0001; NRI + 0.34 to + 0.38, p < 0.1) and AHF-RH at 1
year by gremlin-1 (AUC range: 0.82–0.92, p = 0.0001; NRI + 0.59 to + 0.60, p =
0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: A panel of fibrotic biomarkers, including osteopontin, galectin-3
and gremlin-1, might be useful for long term risk-stratification of symptomatic
ED patients being suspected of AHF.
