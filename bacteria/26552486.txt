BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) modulates host immune
response, mainly T cell responses for its own survival leading to disease or
latent infection. The molecules and mechanisms utilized to accomplish immune
subversion by M. tuberculosis are not fully understood. Understanding the
molecular mechanism of T cell response to M. tuberculosis is important for
development of efficacious vaccine against TB.
METHODS: Here, we investigated effect of M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85A and
ESAT-6 on T cell signalling events in CD3/CD28 induced Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of PPD+ve healthy individuals and pulmonary TB
patients. We studied CD3 induced intracellular calcium mobilization in PBMCs of
healthy individuals and TB patients by spectrofluorimetry, CD3 and CD28 induced
activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in PBMCs of healthy
individuals and TB patients by western blotting and binding of transcription
factors NFAT and NFκB by Electrophorectic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
RESULTS: We observed CD3 triggered modulations in free intracellular calcium
concentrations in PPD+ve healthy individuals and pulmonary TB patients after the 
treatment of M. tuberculosis antigens. As regards the downstream signalling
events, phosphorylation of MAPKs, Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2
(ERK1/2) and p38 was curtailed by M. tuberculosis antigens in TB patients
whereas, in PPD+ve healthy individuals only ERK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited.
Besides, the terminal signalling events like binding of transcription factors
NFAT and NFκB was also altered by M. tuberculosis antigens. Altogether, our
results suggest that M. tuberculosis antigens, specifically ESAT-6, interfere
with TCR/CD28-induced upstream as well as downstream signalling events which
might be responsible for defective IL-2 production which further contributed in
T-cell unresponsiveness, implicated in the progression of disease.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate 
effect of Ag85A and ESAT-6 on TCR- and TCR/CD28- induced upstream and downstream 
signalling events of T-cell activation in TB patients. This study showed the
effect of secretory antigens of M. tuberculosis in the modulation of T cell
signalling pathways. This inflection is accomplished by altering the proximal and
distal events of signalling cascade which could be involved in T-cell
dysfunctioning during the progression of the disease.
