We characterized 54 adult index patients with reports of frequent or severe
bacterial respiratory tract infections at diagnosis of selective subnormal IgG1. 
Mean age was 50 ± 13 (SD) y; 87.0% were women. Associated disorders included the 
following: autoimmune conditions 50.0%; hypothyroidism 24.1%; atopy 38.9%; and
other allergy 31.5%. In 35.5%, proportions of protective S. pneumoniae
serotype-specific IgG levels did not increase after polyvalent pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccination (PPPV). Blood lymphocyte subset levels were within
reference limits in most patients. Regressions on IgG1 and IgG3 revealed no
significant association with age, sex, autoimmune conditions, hypothyroidism,
atopy, other allergy, corticosteroid therapy, or lymphocyte subsets. Regression
on IgG2 revealed significant associations with PPPV response (negative) and CD19+
lymphocytes (positive). Regression on IgG4 revealed significant positive
associations with episodic corticosteroid use and IgA. Regression on IgA revealed
positive associations with IgG2 and IgG4. Regression on IgM revealed negative
associations with CD56+/CD16+ lymphocytes. Regressions on categories of infection
revealed a negative association of urinary tract infections and IgG1. HLA-A(⁎)03,
HLA-B(⁎)55 and HLA-A(⁎)24, HLA-B(⁎)35 haplotype frequencies were greater in 38
patients than 751 controls. We conclude that nonprotective S. pneumoniae IgG
levels and atopy contribute to increased susceptibility to respiratory tract
infections in patients with selective subnormal IgG1.
