Plasmid pBR322 DNA (0.5 mg/mL) isolated from Escherichia coli HB101 was suspended
in Tris-HCI-EDTA (1 mol/L-0.1 mol/L, pH 8.5); then a drop of the above solution
was deposited on freshly cleaved mica substrate. After adsorption for about 1 mm,
the sample was stained with phosphotungstic acid. The residual solution was
removed with a piece of filter paper. Afterwards the sample was imaged with a
home-made atomic force microscope (AFM) in air. The AFM images of pBR322 DNA with
a molecular resolution have been obtained. These images show that pBR322 DNA
exists in several different topological structures: (i) relaxed circular DNA with
a different diameter; (ii) supercondensed DNA with different particle sizes;
(iii) dimeric catenane connected by one relaxed circular molecule and another
close-compacted molecule which might be either supercoiled or intramolecular
knotted form; (iv) oligomeric catenane with multiple irregular molecules in which
DNA is interlocked into a complex oligomer; (v) possibly-existing intermediates
formed from monomer to oligomer.
