In this work, the effects of granular activated carbon (GAC) supplementation on
hydrogen fermentation were investigated in Clostridium butyricum. Maximum
hydrogen production rate and ultimate hydrogen volume increased up to 1.7 and 1.9
fold, respectively, with 1 g/L GAC supplementation. Indicators of stable hydrogen
production, such as acetate and butyrate formation increased with increasing GAC 
concentration. To identify the factors for hydrogen production enhancement,
transcriptome analysis was conducted. Functional genes related to hydrogen
production increased by GAC supplementation (1.75 fold for pfor and 1.48 fold for
oxct). On the other hand, functional genes related to hydrogen consumption
decreased (1.78 fold for ldh, 0.67 fold for adh, 1.64 fold for hbd, 2.4 fold for 
crt, and 0.71 fold for buk). Considered together, these results suggested that
GAC supplementation increased biohydrogen production by changing the metabolic
flux associated with hydrogen production and consumption pathways.
