Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC14672 is remarkable for its production of
phosphoglycolipid compounds, moenomycins, which serve as a blueprint for the
development of a novel class of antibiotics based on inhibition of peptidoglycan 
glycosyltransferases. Here we employed mariner transposon (Tn) mutagenesis to
find new regulatory genes essential for moenomycin production. We generated a
library of 3000 mutants which were screened for altered antibiotic activity. Our 
focus centred on a single mutant, HIM5, which accumulated lower amounts of
moenomycin and was impaired in morphogenesis as compared to the parental strain. 
HIM5 carried the Tn insertion within gene ssfg_01967 for putative tRNA
(N6-isopentenyl adenosine(37)-C2)-methylthiotransferase, or MiaB, and led to a
reduced level of thiomethylation at position 37 in the anticodon of S. ghanaensis
transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). It is likely that the mutant phenotype of HIM5 
stems from the way in which ssfg_01967::Tn influences translation of the rare
leucine codon UUA in several genes for moenomycin production and life cycle
progression in S. ghanaensis. This is the first report showing that quantitative 
changes in tRNA modification status in Streptomyces have physiological
consequences.
