AIMS: We performed an association study to evaluate the contribution of 16 killer
cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genotype polymorphisms and the HLA-C1 and
-C2 ligands in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Saudi Arabian
patients.
METHODS: A total of 52 patients with different stages of malignant CRC as well as
70 healthy Saudi controls were enrolled at the King Khalid University Hospital.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the frequency of the activating mutations
KIR2DS1, 2DS2, 2DS3, 2DS5, and 3DS1 was significantly higher in CRC patients
compared to controls. The 3DS1 gene contributed to the highest risk of CRC (odds 
ratio [OR] = 16.25, p < 0.0001), followed by 2DS1 (OR = 8.6; p < 0.0001). The
distributions of HLA-C1 and -C2 ligands were not significantly different between 
patients and controls. Analyses of different combinations of KIR genes with their
HLA-C1 and -C2 ligands show that the frequency of 2DL3 in the presence of its
ligand, the allotype C1, was significantly more prevalent in patients compared to
controls. In addition, 2DL2 and 2DL3 that were aggregated in combination with the
ligand, HLA-C1, were found to be more highly associated mainly with the
homozygote HLA-C1/C1 (p = 0.03; OR = 2.6). The activating mutations 2DS1 and 2DS2
when combined with their respective ligands, HLA-C2 and -C1, showed highly
significant associations with CRC development.
CONCLUSION: This study supports a key role for KIR gene mutations in the
development of CRC, especially in association with their ligands.
