Heterotopic ossification (HO), or the pathologic formation of bone within soft
tissues, is a significant complication following severe injuries as it impairs
joint motion and function leading to loss of the ability to perform activities of
daily living and pain. While soft tissue injury is a prerequisite of developing
HO, the exact molecular pathology leading to trauma-induced HO remains unknown.
Through prior investigations aimed at identifying the causative factors of HO, it
has been suggested that additional predisposing factors that favor ossification
within the injured soft tissues environment are required. Considering that
chondrocytes and osteoblasts initiate physiologic bone formation by depositing
nanohydroxyapatite crystal into their extracellular environment, we investigated 
the hypothesis that deposition of nanohydroxyapatite within damaged skeletal
muscle is likewise sufficient to predispose skeletal muscle to HO. Using a murine
model genetically predisposed to nanohydroxyapatite deposition (ABCC6-deficient
mice), we observed that following a focal muscle injury, nanohydroxyapatite was
robustly deposited in a gene-dependent manner, yet resolved via
macrophage-mediated regression over 28 days post injury. However, if
macrophage-mediated regression was inhibited, we observed persistent
nanohydroxyapatite that was sufficient to drive the formation of HO in 4/5 mice
examined. Together, these results revealed a new paradigm by suggesting the
persistent nanohydroxyapatite, referred to clinically as dystrophic
calcification, and HO may be stages of a pathologic continuum, and not discrete
events. As such, if confirmed clinically, these findings support the use of early
therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing nanohydroxyapatite as a strategy to
evade HO formation.
