Bad breath typically originates in the mouth, often from the back of the tongue. 
Nasal problems also can cause bad breath; odor generated in this manner can be
easily distinguished from mouth odor by comparing the odor exiting the mouth and 
nose. In most cases, good professional oral care combined with a daily regimen of
oral hygiene--including interdental cleaning, deep tongue cleaning and optional
use of an efficacious mouthrinse---will lead to improvement. This article
discusses common causes of oral malodor as well as methods to assess the extent
of the problem.
