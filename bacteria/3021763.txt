Nucleotide sequence of the structural genes for an anion pump. The
plasmid-encoded arsenical resistance operon.

Chen CM, Misra TK, Silver S, Rosen BP.

The structural genes for the arsenical pump of the conjugative R-factor R773
contained on a HindIII fragment of 4.3 kilobase pairs were cloned into
bacteriophage M13. A series of ordered deletions was created using Bal31
digestion, and the nucleotide sequence of the operon determined. Three open
reading frames for genes arsA, arsB, and arsC were found. The arsA gene encodes a
hydrophilic protein of 63,169 Da with two potential adenylate-binding sites. The 
arsB gene encodes a potentially membrane protein of 45,577 Da. The arsC gene
encodes a 15,811-Da hydrophilic protein. The arsA and arsC gene products
correspond to cytosolic proteins previously identified from minicell experiments.
Isolated ArsA protein was shown to bind to dye-agarose columns which act as
affinity resins for nucleotide-binding proteins. A model is proposed in which
these gene products form an anion translocating ATPase for extrusion of arsenite 
and arsenate from resistant cells.
