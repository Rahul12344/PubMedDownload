Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to image circular DNA adsorbed on freshly 
cleaved mica and mica chemically modified with Mg(II), Co(II), La(III), and
Zr(IV). Images obtained on unmodified mica show coiling of DNA due to forces
involved during the drying process. The coiling or super twisting appeared to be 
right handed and the extent of super twisting could be controlled by the drying
conditions. Images of DNA observed on chemically modified surfaces show isolated 
open circular DNA that is free from super twisting, presumably due to strong
binding of DNA on chemically modified surfaces.
