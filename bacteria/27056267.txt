BACKGROUND: Guttate psoriasis (GP) is characterized by acute onset of small,
rounded psoriatic lesions. Although this particular phenotype of psoriasis is
usually associated with streptococcal throat infections and mainly occurs in
HLA-Cw6(+) patients, the specific immunologic response to this innate stimulus
that causes these skin lesions is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate how key cellular elements of patients
with GP respond to Streptococcus pyogenes and whether this initial immune
response is favored by the genetic and environmental background of these
patients.
METHODS: Circulating memory T cells and autologous epidermal cells from samples
from either patients with GP (n = 14) or healthy control subjects (n = 6) were
cocultured ex vivo in the presence of an S pyogenes extract. Levels of the
psoriasis-associated cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-8 were 
determined. The expression of several genes with increased (DEFB4, S100A7, LCN2, 
IL36G, IL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) or decreased (FLG and LOR) transcripts in 
psoriatic lesions was examined in keratinocytes treated with coculture
supernatants.
RESULTS: When skin-homing effector memory cutaneous lymphocyte antigen-positive
T cells were used in cocultures, a TH17-dominant response was observed, as
reflected by the higher amounts of IL-17A and IL-17F than IFN-γ. Moreover, a
higher TH17 response was observed in cells isolated from patients with flares
associated with a streptococcal tonsillitis and with the HLA-Cw6 allele (cohort
1). In addition, in normal keratinocytes the supernatants from these cocultures
induced an increase in IL-17-associated genes, such as DEFB4, S100A7, LCN2,
IL36G, and IL8 but a decrease in FLG and LOR, thereby confirming the role of
activated TH17 cells.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals a dominant TH17 response of cutaneous lymphocyte
antigen-positive T cells activated by epidermal cells and S pyogenes in patients 
with GP.
