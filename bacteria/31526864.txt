BACKGROUND: The role of CD19+CD24highCD38high B-regulatory cells in solid-organ
Transplant (Tx) in acceptance are still scarce. In previous studies on kidney
transplant recipients may suggest a protective role of this cell subtype in graft
tolerance and the existence of a cross talk between B-and T-regulatory clones. In
lung transplantation, the role of B-regulatory cells has never been investigated.
In a murine tracheal transplantation model, this subset seems able to prevent
tracheal obliteration when in combination with rapamycin. Aim of this study is to
analyze peripheral CD19+CD24highCD38high B-reg cells counts in a cohort of lung
recipients, their association with several clinical and pharmacological variables
and their possible association with T regulatory cell.
METHODS: From Jan 2009 to Dec 2014, 117 lung Tx recipients were submitted to an
immunological follow up I-FU(median: 108.7 months (6.7-310.5)). Immunological
follow up consisted of a complete blood peripheral immuno-phenotype, inclusive of
CD19+CD24highCD38high B-cells (globally 1106 determinations). We tested the
association between B-reg and relevant variables by linear or regression models
for repeated measures, adjusting for time from Tx.
RESULTS: Among all variables analyzed at multivariate analysis: chronic rejection
(OR - 0.19, p = .039), use of Mycophenolate (OR - 0.38, p < .001) and the
presence of a concomitant pulmonary infection of S. aureus (OR 0.66, p = .002)
and A. fumigatus (OR 0.50, p = .009) were significantly associated to B-reg cell.
No significant correlation between CD19+CD24highCD38high B-reg cells and T-reg
cells counts was found in our cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Our present data highlight, for the first time, that this cell
subset might participate in long-term lung graft acceptance mechanisms.
