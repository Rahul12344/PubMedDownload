Actinomycetes genome sequencing and bioinformatic analyses revealed a large
number of "cryptic" gene clusters coding for secondary metabolism. These gene
clusters have the potential to increase the chemical diversity of natural
products. Indeed, reexamination of well-characterized actinomycetes strains
revealed a variety of hidden treasures. Growing information about this metabolic 
diversity has promoted further development of strategies to discover novel
biologically active compounds produced by actinomycetes. This new task for
actinomycetes genetics requires the development and use of new approaches and
tools. Application of synthetic biology approaches led to the development of a
set of strategies and tools to satisfy these new requirements. In this review, we
discuss strategies and methods to discover small molecules produced by these
fascinating bacteria and also discuss a variety of genetic instruments and
regulatory elements used to activate secondary metabolism cryptic genes for the
overproduction of these metabolites.
