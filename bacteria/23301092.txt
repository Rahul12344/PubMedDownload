Large organic food falls to the deep sea--such as whale carcasses and wood
logs--are known to serve as stepping stones for the dispersal of highly adapted
chemosynthetic organisms inhabiting hot vents and cold seeps. Here we
investigated the biogeochemical and microbiological processes leading to the
development of sulfidic niches by deploying wood colonization experiments at a
depth of 1690 m in the Eastern Mediterranean for one year. Wood-boring bivalves
of the genus Xylophaga played a key role in the degradation of the wood logs,
facilitating the development of anoxic zones and anaerobic microbial processes
such as sulfate reduction. Fauna and bacteria associated with the wood included
types reported from other deep-sea habitats including chemosynthetic ecosystems, 
confirming the potential role of large organic food falls as biodiversity hot
spots and stepping stones for vent and seep communities. Specific bacterial
communities developed on and around the wood falls within one year and were
distinct from freshly submerged wood and background sediments. These included
sulfate-reducing and cellulolytic bacterial taxa, which are likely to play an
important role in the utilization of wood by chemosynthetic life and other
deep-sea animals.
