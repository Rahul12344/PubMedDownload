Microbiological results of 2,539 hams were analyzed (counts of mesophilic
aerobes, Salmonella sp. and S. aureus) at the National Public health Laboratory
from 1979 to 1987. In 58.7 percent of the cases the hams were not acceptable for 
human consumption, due to any of the above mentioned microbiological
determinations. The main cause was the finding of high levels of mesophilic
aerobes (57.5%), followed by Salmonella sp (4.4%) and S. aureus (0.43%). Raw,
cooked and smoked hams presented the highest counts of mesophilic aerobes.
Virginia, american style and blade hams presented the most elevated frequencies
of Salmonella sp. Baked ham was the one in better sanitary conditions. The
conclusion is that the quality of hams in Mexico City is bad.
