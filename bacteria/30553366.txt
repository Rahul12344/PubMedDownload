Inulin was introduced to the fructose permeates of Gluconacetobacter xylinus
(ATCC 10,245) bacterial strain to successfully synthesize empty cellulosic
pockets for possible drug storage. FTIR Spectroscopy analysis confirmed a slight 
variation in the hydrogen bonds at 2893 cm-1 due to CH and CH2 stretching whiles 
Conformational analysis revealed that inulobiose extending all-trans conformation
corresponded to φ = Ψ = ω  = 180°. Fructofuranose moiety, the anomeric carbon was
defined as C2. The definition of torsional angles φ = ϴ(C1-C2-0-CI'), Ψ = ϴ
(C2-0-C 1'-C2'), and ω = ϴ(0-C1'-C2'-0') followed the proposed convention.
Glycosidic angle C1'0 l'C2' was taken to be 114.0° and both O6 hydroxyl groups in
inulobiose were fixed in a trans position, compelling the hydroxyl group to
sterically favor comparison with the gauche orientation of sucrose structure. XRD
analysis results indicated a typical cellulose type I. DSC and TGA analysis
revealed a highly stable pocket until about 260°C.
