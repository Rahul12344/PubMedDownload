The Bcl-2-associated athanogene (BAG) family is an evolutionarily conserved,
multifunctional group of cytoprotective co-chaperones. Using structural
bioinformatic approaches we identified 7 homologs of the Arabidopsis BAG family. 
Evaluating knockouts in Arabidopsis of individual BAG family members, we noted
that Arabidopsis BAG6 (AtBAG6) knockout lines exhibited a pronounced enhancement 
of susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Moreover,
we identified a single predicted caspase-1 site that was cleaved by an aspartyl
protease (AtAPCB1). Finally, we showed AtBAG6 forms a complex with AtAPCB1 via
coupling to a C2 GRAM domain protein (AtBAGP1). This complex and its activation
is necessary for triggering pathogen mediated autophagic cell death and host
resistance.
