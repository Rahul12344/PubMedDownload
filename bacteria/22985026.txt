BACKGROUND: Advanced stages of leprosy show T cell unresponsiveness and lipids of
mycobacterial origin are speculated to modulate immune responses in these
patients. Present study elucidates the role of phenolicglycolipid (PGL-1) and
Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (Man-LAM) on TCR- and TCR/CD28- mediated
signalling.
RESULTS: We observed that lipid antigens significantly inhibit proximal early
signalling events like Zap-70 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization.
Interestingly, these antigens preferentially curtailed TCR-triggered early
downstream signalling events like p38 phosphorylation whereas potentiated that of
Erk1/2. Further, at later stages inhibition of NFAT binding, IL-2 message, CD25
expression and T-cell blastogenesis by PGL-1 and Man-LAM was noted.
CONCLUSION: Altogether, we report that Man-LAM and PGL-1 preferentially interfere
with TCR/CD28-triggered upstream cell signalling events, leading to reduced IL-2 
secretion and T-cell blastogenesis which potentially could lead to
immunosupression and thus, disease exacerbation, as noted in disease spectrum.
