BACKGROUND: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an infection caused by Leishmania
(L.) protozoa transmitted through the bite of infected sand fly. Previously,
invasive sampling of blood and skin along with low throughput methods were used
for determination of inflammatory response in CL patients.
AIMS/METHODOLOGY: We established a novel approach based on a non-invasive
adhesive tape-disc sampling combined with a powerful multiplexing technique
called proximity extension assay for profiling 92 inflammatory cytokines,
chemokines and surface molecules in the lesions of CL patients infected with L.
tropica. Sample collection was done non-invasively by using adhesive tape-discs
from lesion and normal skin of 33 L. tropica positive patients.
RESULTS: Out of 92 inflammatory proteins, the level of 34 proteins was
significantly increased in the lesions of CL patients compared to their normal
skin. This includes the chemokines CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL1, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 
and CXCL11, together with the interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, LIF and OSM. The
remaining significantly changed inflammatory proteins include 7 surface molecules
and receptors: CD5, CD40, CDCP1, 4E-BP1, TNFRSF9, IL-18R1 and OPG as well as 16
other cytokines and proteins: MMP-1, CSF-1, VEGFA, uPA, EN-RAGE, LAP TGF-β1, HGF,
MMP-10, CASP-8, TNFSF14, STAMPB, ADA, TRAIL and ST1A1. Further, 13 proteins
showed an increasing trend, albeit not statistically significant, in the CL
lesions, including TGF-α, CCL23, MCP-2, IL-12B, CXCL6, IL-24, FGF-19, TNFβ, CD6, 
TRANCE, IL10, SIR2 and CCL20.
CONCLUSION: We herein report a novel approach based on a non-invasive sampling
method combined with the high-throughput protein assay for profiling inflammatory
proteins in CL lesions. Using this approach, we could profile inflammatory
proteins in the lesions from CL patients. This new non-invasive approach may have
implications for studying skin inflammatory mediators in CL and other skin
disorders.
