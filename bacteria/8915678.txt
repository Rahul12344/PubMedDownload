Little has so far been known about the role of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in
the activation of T cells by superantigens. Recently several studies showed that 
superantigens could directly activate purified T cells in the presence of CD28
costimulation. Here we investigate V beta expression of T cells activated by the 
superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1), plus CD28 costimulation, in
the absence of APCs. The aim of this study was to ask if TSST-1 activated
purified T cells in the presence of CD28 costimulation with the same specificity 
as in the presence of APCs. We provide evidence that the specificity of TSST-1 to
human V beta, in the presence of CD28 costimulation, is identical to that in the 
presence of APCs, with V beta 2 being significantly expanded. The results
indicate that the main role of APCs in the superantigen-mediated T cell
activation may be to provide T cells with CD28 costimulation.
