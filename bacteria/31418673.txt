In Western Europe, the incidence of both respiratory and cutaneous diphtheria,
caused by toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Corynebacterium ulcerans
or Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, has been low over the past few decades
thanks to the use of an effective vaccine and a high level of vaccination
coverage. However, the disease has still not been eradicated and continues to
occur in all of Europe. In order to prevent sequelae or a fatal outcome,
diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) should be administered to suspected diphtheria
patients as soon as possible, but economic factors and issues concerning
regulations have led to poor availability of DAT in many countries. The European 
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organization have
called for European Union-wide solutions to this DAT-shortage. In order to
illustrate the importance of these efforts and underline the need for continued
diphtheria surveillance, we present data on all registered cases of toxigenic and
non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae, C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis in Belgium
during the past decade, up to and including 2017.
