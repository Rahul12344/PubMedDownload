FYVE and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 1 (FYCO1), a multidomain autophagy
adaptor protein, mediates microtubule plus-end-directed autophagosome transport
by interacting with kinesin motor proteins and with the autophagosomal membrane
components microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), Rab7 and
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). To establish the structural basis for
the recognition of FYCO1 by LC3, the crystal structure of mouse LC3B in complex
with the FYCO1 LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif peptide was determined.
Structural analysis showed that the flanking sequences N-terminal and C-terminal 
to the LIR core sequence of FYCO1, as well as the tetrapeptide core sequence,
were specifically recognized by LC3B and contributed to the binding. Moreover,
comparisons of related structures revealed a conserved mechanism of FYCO1
recognition by different LC3 isoforms among different species.
