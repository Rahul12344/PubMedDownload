BACKGROUND: The predominant X-linked form of dyskeratosis congenita results from 
mutations in dyskerin, a protein required for ribosomal RNA modification that is 
also a component of the telomerase complex. We have previously found that
expression of an internal fragment of dyskerin (GSE24.2) rescues telomerase
activity in X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (X-DC) patient cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we have generated F9 mouse cell lines expressing the
most frequent mutation found in X-DC patients, A353V and study the effect of
expressing the GSE24.2 cDNA or GSE24.2 peptide on telomerase activity by TRAP
assay, and mTERT and mTR expression by Q-PCR. Point mutation in GSE24.2 residues 
were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.
RESULTS: Expression of GSE24.2 increases mTR and to a lesser extent mTERT RNA
levels, and leads to recovery of telomerase activity. Point mutations in GSE24.2 
residues known to be highly conserved and crucial for the pseudouridine-synthase 
activity of dyskerin abolished the effect of the peptide. Recovery of telomerase 
activity and increase in mTERT levels were found when the GSE24.2 peptide
purified from bacteria was introduced into the cells. Moreover, mTR stability was
also rescued by transfection of the peptide GSE24.2.
DISCUSSION: These data indicate that supplying GSE24.2, either from a cDNA
vector, or as a peptide, can reduces the pathogenic effects of Dkc1 mutations and
could form the basis of a novel therapeutic approach.
