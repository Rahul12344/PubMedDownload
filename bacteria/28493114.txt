Contamination and infection with extensive drug resistant (XDR) bacteria are
increasing in urology with the exception of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus (MRSA) (stabilization). They often lead to logistic and therapeutical
problems. Only 30-50% of XDR cases are of exogenous origin. To slow this trend,
screening, hygiene programs, isolation, decontamination, targeted therapy of
symptomatic infections, education programs, and success controls should be
applied. Furthermore, all regulatory and legal instructions should be followed.
Local hygiene networks help to find apt measures for XDR control. It is important
to balance hygiene measures against hygiene hysteria. To prepare urological
instruments, a local instrument preparation plan that takes into consideration
all legal instructions should be followed. The efforts in health system general
prophylactic measures should be supported. Only with consistent implementation in
all areas of daily life (health care, local environment, animal husbandry, and
soil contaminated within the framework of animal husbandry) can a substantial
reduction of XDR bacteria be achieved in the long term.
