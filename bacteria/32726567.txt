Polysaccharides are major components of macroalgal and phytoplankton biomass and 
constitute a large fraction of the organic matter produced and degraded in the
ocean. Until recently, however, our knowledge of marine polysaccharides was
limited due to their great structural complexity, the correspondingly complicated
enzymatic machinery used by microbial communities to degrade them, and a lack of 
readily applied means to isolate andcharacterize polysaccharides in detail.
Advances in carbohydrate chemistry, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, and
microbiology have led to new insights into the structures of polysaccharides, the
means by which they are degraded by bacteria, and the ecology of polysaccharide
production and decomposition. Here, we survey current knowledge, discuss recent
advances, and present a new conceptual model linking polysaccharide structural
complexity and abundance to microbially driven mechanisms of polysaccharide
processing. We conclude by highlighting specific future research foci that will
shed light on this central but poorly characterized component of the marine
carbon cycle.
