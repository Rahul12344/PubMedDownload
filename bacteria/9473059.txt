GDP-L-fucose, the substrate for fucosyltransferases for addition of fucose to
polysaccharides or glycoproteins in both procaryotes and eucaryotes, is made from
GDP-D-mannose. L-Fucose is a component of bacterial surface antigens, including
the extracellular polysaccharide colanic acid produced by most Escherichia coli
strains. We previously sequenced the E. coli colanic acid gene cluster and
identified one of the GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic pathway genes, gmd. We report
here the identification of the gene (fcl), located downstream of gmd, encoding
the fucose synthetase.
