Two enzymes with phospholipase D activity were purified from Streptomyces strains
(PMF and PM43) by column chromatography on Fractogel TSK CM-650(S), Sephadex
G-100 and Fractogel EMD DEAE-650(M). The purified preparations were found to be
homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, capillary electrophoresis and analytical gel filtration.
The molecular masses, assessed by MALDI-MS spectrometry, were 53.864 kDa for PMF 
and 54.147 kDa for PM43. The isoelectric point was 9.1 for both enzymes. The
enzymes were most active at around 60 degrees C and stable between pH 4 and 9 and
below 50 degrees C. The pH optima were between 4 and 6 for PMF and between 6 and 
7 for PM43. Both phospholipases displayed high transphosphatidylation activity
but PMF was more selective than PM43.
