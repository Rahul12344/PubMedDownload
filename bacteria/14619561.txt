OBJECTIVE: To define the regulation mechanism of the enhancement expression of
human beta-defensin-1 (hBD-1) stimulated by bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) at
transcription level.
METHODS: A series of 5'-flanking deletions of hBD-1 gene were ligated into
pEGFP-1 and pCAT basic vector. pEGFP hBD-1 recombinants were transfected into
SPC-A-1 cells and the green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression was observed by
fluorescence microscopy. SPC-A-1 cells were co-transfected with pCAT hBD-1
constructs and pSV-beta-Galactosidase control vector and were stimulated with
effective BCG cell wall components. CAT and beta-Gal protein expressions were
determined by ELISA.
RESULTS: The promoting activity of the -69 region was lower than that of the
region -575 and -314. After being stimulated with the active fraction of BCG cell
wall proteins, the relative CAT expression of pCAT hBD-1/-69 still showed the
increasing tendency of -2161 construct. Computer consensus match analysis
indicated that the nucleotides between -63 bp to -50 bp was the potential binding
site for C/EBP beta.
CONCLUSION: The nucleotides from -69 to bp is essential to the enhancement of
hBD-1 gene transcription by BCG.
