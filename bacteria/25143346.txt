SLC26A3, or downregulated in adenoma (DRA), plays a major role in mediating Cl(-)
absorption in the mammalian intestine. Disturbances in DRA function and
expression have been implicated in intestinal disorders such as congenital Cl(-) 
diarrhea and gut inflammation. We previously showed that an increase in DRA
function and expression by Lactobacillus acidophilus and its culture supernatant 
(CS) might underlie antidiarrheal effects of this probiotic strain. However, the 
effects of Bifidobacterium species, important inhabitants of the human colon, on 
intestinal Cl(-)/HCO3 (-) exchange activity are not known. Our current results
demonstrate that CS derived from Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis,
and Bifidobacterium bifidum increased anion exchange activity in Caco-2 cells
(∼1.8- to 2.4-fold). Consistent with the increase in DRA function, CS also
increased the protein, as well as the mRNA, level of DRA (but not putative anion 
transporter 1). CS of all three Bifidobacterium sp. increased DRA promoter
activity (-1,183/+114 bp) in Caco-2 cells (1.5- to 1.8-fold). Furthermore, the
increase in DRA mRNA expression by CS of B. breve and B. infantis was blocked in 
the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (5 μM) and the ERK1/2
MAPK pathway inhibitor U0126 (10 μM). Administration of live B. breve, B.
infantis, and B. bifidum by oral gavage to mice for 24 h increased DRA mRNA and
protein levels in the colon. These data demonstrate an upregulation of DRA via
activation of the ERK1/2 pathway that may underlie potential antidiarrheal
effects of Bifidobacterium sp.
