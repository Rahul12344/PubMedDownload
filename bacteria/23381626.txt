Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) produces an ≈ 20 kDa B. fragilis
enterotoxin (BFT), which plays an essential role in mucosal inflammation.
Lipocalin (Lcn)-2, a siderophore-binding antimicrobial protein, is critical for
control of bacterial infection; however, expression of Lcn-2 in BFT-exposed
intestinal epithelial cells has not been elucidated. In the present study,
stimulation of human intestinal epithelial cells with BFT resulted in the
upregulation of Lcn-2 expression that was a relatively late response of
intestinal epithelial cells compared with human β-defensin (hBD)-2 expression.
The upregulation of Lcn-2 was dependent on AP-1 but not on NF-κB signaling. Lcn-2
induction via AP-1 was regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
including ERK and p38. Lcn-2 was secreted from the apical and basolateral
surfaces in BFT-treated cells. These results suggest that a signaling pathway
involving MAPKs and AP-1 is required for Lcn-2 induction in intestinal epithelial
cells exposed to BFT, after which the secreted Lcn-2 may facilitate antimicrobial
activity within ETBF-infected mucosa.
