OBJECTIVE: Most endometrial carcinomas appear to develop from precursors (e.g.,
endometrial hyperplasia) that progress for several years. Patients who are
ultimately diagnosed with carcinoma often present clinically with complaints of
abnormal vaginal bleeding years before diagnosis, which offers an opportunity for
early diagnosis and curative treatment. The analysis of DNA methylation may be
used as a method for detecting endometrial cancer (EC). To test the potential
clinical application of this method, we used quantitative methylation analysis of
five genes in a full spectrum of endometrial lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hospital-based, prospective, case-controlled study
was conducted on 68 patients, which included patients who had a normal
endometrium (n = 18), hyperplasia of the endometrium (n = 24), and EC (n = 26).
Methylation levels of the following genes were determined by using real-time
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification: zinc finger
protein 177 (ZNF177), collagen type XIV α1 (COL14A1), dihydropyrimidinase-like 4 
(DPYSL4), homeobox A9 (HOXA9), transmembrane protein with epidermal growth
factor-like and two follistatin-like domains 2 (TMEFF2). The methylation index
(MI) cutoff values for the different diagnoses were determined to test the
sensitivity and specificity of the method and to generate the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test
between-group differences in the MI.
RESULTS: The MI of the five genes was significantly higher in EC than the MIs in 
specimens of hyperplasia of endometrium and normal appearance (p < 0.001). The
ROC analysis demonstrated that the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for
detecting EC were 92.3%, 94.4%, and 95.1%, respectively, for ZNF177; 92.3%,
94.4%, and 95.7%, respectively, for COL14A1; 80.8%, 94.4%, and 81.4%,
respectively, for HOXA9; 65.4%, 94.4%, and 89.5%, respectively, for TMEFF2; and
61.5%, 94.4%, and 63.3%, respectively, for DPYSL4. The combined testing of ZNF177
and COL14A1 had the best specificity (100%), but compromised sensitivity (88.5%).
CONCLUSION: Promoter methylation of ZNF177, COL14A1, HOXA9, DPYSL4, and TMEFF2
genes is a frequent epigenetic event in EC. Furthermore, the epigenetic
hypermethylation of TMEFF2 may be a valuable marker for identifying undetected EC
within endometrial hyperplasia.
