Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella enterica has been deemed a high-priority
pathogen by the World Health Organization. Two hundred and sixty-four Salmonella 
enterica isolates recovered over a 16-year period (2000 to 2016) from the poultry
and swine production chains, in Brazil, were investigated by whole-genome
sequencing (WGS). Most international lineages belonging to 28 serovars,
including, S. enterica serovars S. Schwarzengrund ST96, S. Typhimurium ST19, S.
Minnesota ST548, S. Infantis ST32, S. Heidelberg ST15, S. Newport ST45, S.
Brandenburg ST65 and S. Kentucky ST198 displayed MDR and virulent genetic
backgrounds. In this regard, resistome analysis revealed presence of qnrE1
(identified for the first time in S. Typhimurium from food chain), qnrB19, qnrS1,
blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-2 and blaCMY-2 genes, as well as gyrA mutations; whereas
ColpVC, IncHI2A, IncHI2, IncFIA, Incl1, IncA/C2, IncR, IncX1 and po111 plasmids
were detected. In addition, phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple independent
lineages such as S. enterica serovars S. Infantis, S. Schwarzengrund, S.
Minnesota, S. Kentucky and S. Brandenburg. In brief, ocurrence and persistence of
international lineages of S. enterica serovars in food production chain is
supported by conserved genomes and wide virulome and resistome.
