BACKGROUND: Phocomelia, which is primarily due to a disruption in the
proximodistal axis, is found in virtually all mouse embryos exposed to high doses
of retinoic acid (RA) on 11 days post coitum (dpc).
METHODS: To identify genes that potentially mediate the effects of retinoic acid 
(RA) on limb development, we have examined the expression of 9,000 clones from
the IMAGE consortium by microarray analysis of RNA isolated from 11 dpc mouse
forelimbs exposed to RA or vehicle for 6 hr. Eight genes that demonstrated
altered expression were chosen for further study of their mRNA levels using
RT-PCR. Protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 9,000 genes examined in the microarray, approximately 111
demonstrated altered expression (33 known genes and 78 ESTs). Of the eight known 
genes chosen for further study using RT-PCR, four mRNAs (PBX1a, PBX1b, IGF-Ia,
and IGF-Ib) demonstrated consistent elevation ( approximately 3-fold) in their
levels after RA treatment in both the forelimbs and hindlimbs as early as 3 hr
after RA treatment. In addition to the two PBX1 isoforms, the mRNA level of the
other two subtypes (PBX2 and PBX3) and the level of PBX1/2/3 protein were also
found to be elevated in limb buds after RA treatment. Finally, we examined the
expression of MEIS1, MEIS2, and MEIS3 because these proteins are necessary for
PBX nuclear localization. The mRNA level of all three subtypes of MEIS were
elevated approximately three- to four-fold in both the forelimbs and hindlimbs
after RA treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Because both PBX and MEIS (and their orthologs) are believed to be
involved in the control of proximodistal axis formation in mouse and fly limbs
and IGFs in the development of limbs, we suggest that increases in PBX, MEIS and 
IGF-1 mRNA levels may contribute to proximodistal limb reduction defects caused
by teratogenic doses of RA.
