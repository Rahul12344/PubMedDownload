Lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) are critical for immune responses, yet how 
they develop from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells is poorly defined. In
humans and mice, it is possible to isolate phenotypically defined subsets of bone
marrow (BM) cells that represent intermediate progenitors without long-term
repopulating characteristics but with specific lineage differentiation
properties. For instance, murine BM CD34+ CD45RA+ cells are progenitors for B and
T lymphocytes with no in vivo repopulation activity. In human BM, a small subset 
(5%) of cells having the phenotype CD34+ Lin- CD10+ CD45RA+ CD38+ Thy-1- c-kit-
represents a new class of hematopoietic progenitor cells that gives rise to
lymphocytes [T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells] and to DCs but does not produce
myeloid or erythroid cells. The identification of such progenitor cells provides 
the opportunity to define the differentiation and growth requirements for the
production of lymphocytes and DCs. Genes involved in lineage specification can
also be studied. Altogether, these studies have fundamental implications for
understanding the biology of pivotal lineages of immune cells. This understanding
could be used to treat a variety of immunodeficiencies and to design novel
immunotherapies particularly in the context of hematopoietic cell
transplantation.
