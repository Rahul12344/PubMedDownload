Resolution of infection with attenuated Salmonella is an active process that
requires CD4(+) T cells. Here, we demonstrate that costimulation via the surface 
molecule CD28, but not antibody production by B cells, is required for clearance 
of attenuated aroA Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. In contrast, specific
antibody is critical for vaccine-induced protection against virulent bacteria.
Therefore, CD28(+) CD4(+) T cells are sufficient for clearance of avirulent
Salmonella in naive hosts, whereas CD4(+) T cells and specific antibodies are
required for protection from virulent Salmonella in immune hosts.
