A hallmark feature of several pathogenic microbes is the distinctive color of
their colonies when propagated in the clinical laboratory. Such pigmentation
comes in a variety of hues, and has often proven useful in presumptive clinical
diagnosis. Recent advances in microbial pigment biochemistry and the genetic
basis of pigment production have sometimes revealed a more sinister aspect to
these curious materials that change the color of reflected light by selective
light absorbance. In many cases, the microbial pigment contributes to disease
pathogenesis by interfering with host immune clearance mechanisms or by
exhibiting pro-inflammatory or cytotoxic properties. We review several examples
of pigments that promote microbial virulence, including the golden
staphyloxanthin of Staphylococcusaureus, the blue-green pyocyanin of Pseudomonas 
spp., and the dark brown or black melanin pigments of Cryptococcus neoformans and
Aspergillus spp. Targeted pigment neutralisation might represent a viable concept
to enhance treatment of certain difficult infectious disease conditions.
