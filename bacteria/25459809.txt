Mixed bacterial communities from the rumen ferment cellulosic biomass primarily
to C2-C4 volatile fatty acids, and perform only limited chain extension to
produce C5 (valeric) and C6 (caproic) acids. The aim of this study was to
increase production of caproate and valerate in short-term in vitro incubations. 
Co-culture of mixed ruminal microbes with a rumen-derived strain of the bacterium
Clostridium kluyveri converted cellulosic biomass (alfalfa stems or switchgrass
herbage) plus ethanol to VFA mixtures that include valeric and caproic acids as
the major fermentation products over a 48-72h run time. Concentrations of
caproate reached 6.1gL(-1), similar to or greater than those reported in most
conventional carboxylate fermentations that employ substantially longer run
times.
