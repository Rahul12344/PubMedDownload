Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA-mismatched unrelated donors can
cure life-threatening blood disorders, but its success is limited by
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). HLA-B leaders encode methionine (M) or
threonine (T) at position 2 and give rise to TT, MT, or MM genotypes. The
dimorphic HLA-B leader informs GVHD risk in HLA-B-mismatched HCT. If the leader
influences outcome in other HLA-mismatched transplant settings, the success of
HCT could be improved for future patients. We determined leader genotypes for
10 415 patients receiving a transplant between 1988 and 2016 from unrelated
donors with one HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, or HLA-DQB1 mismatch. Multivariate
regression methods were used to evaluate risks associated with patient leader
genotype according to the mismatched HLA locus and with HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C,
HLA-DRB1, or HLA-DQB1 mismatching according to patient leader genotype. The
impact of the patient leader genotype on acute GVHD and mortality varied across
different mismatched HLA loci. Nonrelapse mortality was higher among
HLA-DQB1-mismatched MM patients compared with HLA-DQB1-mismatched TT patients
(hazard ratio, 1.35; P = .01). Grades III to IV GVHD risk was higher among
HLA-DRB1-mismatched MM or MT patients compared with HLA-DRB1-mismatched TT
patients (odds ratio, 2.52 and 1.51, respectively). Patients tolerated a single
HLA-DQB1 mismatch better than mismatches at other loci. Outcome after
HLA-mismatched transplantation depends on the HLA-B leader dimorphism and the
mismatched HLA locus. The patient's leader variant provides new information on
the limits of HLA mismatching. The success of HLA-mismatched unrelated
transplantation might be enhanced through the judicious selection of mismatched
donors for a patient's leader genotype.
