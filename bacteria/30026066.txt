Interleukin (IL)-17 is a key member of the Th17 cytokines and has been reported
to be involved in the pathomechanisms underlying various diseases, including
infectious diseases. Infections with community-associated methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have garnered worldwide attention, and the
representative USA300 strain is known to cause pneumonia in healthy people, which
can be lethal. However, little is known about the role of IL-17 in CA-MRSA
pneumonia. In this study, we investigated the role of IL-17 in a CA-MRSA
pneumonia animal model. Mortality was higher and occurred at an earlier stage of 
infection in the IL-17A-knockout mice than in the wild-type (P < 0.01) and
IL-17A/F-knockout mice (P < 0.05); however, no significant difference in the
intrapulmonary bacterial counts was observed among the three groups of mice.
Moreover, the IL-17A-knockout group showed significantly higher levels of IL-17F 
and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and a significantly higher
neutrophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid than the other groups. These
results confirmed that G-CSF expression significantly increased, and significant 
neutrophilic inflammation occurred under conditions of IL-17A deficiency in the
murine CA-MRSA pneumonia model.
