A screen for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) mutants sensitive to reactive
nitrogen intermediates identified transposon insertions in the presumptive
proteasomal ATPase gene mpa (mycobacterium proteasome ATPase; Rv2115c). mpa
mutants are attenuated in both wild type and nitric oxide synthase 2 deficient
mice. In this work, we show that attenuation of mpa mutants is severe, and that
Mpa is an ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA) ATPase that
forms hexameric rings resembling the eukaryotic complex p97/valosin-containing
protein (VCP). Point mutations in the conserved Walker box ATPase motifs of Mpa
greatly reduced or abolished ATPase activity in vitro and abrogated protection of
Mtb against acidified nitrite. A mutant Mpa protein missing only its last two
amino acids retained ATPase activity, yet failed to protect Mtb against nitrite. 
The corresponding strain was attenuated in mice. Thus, Mpa is an ATPase whose
enzymatic activity is necessary but not sufficient to protect against reactive
nitrogen intermediates.
