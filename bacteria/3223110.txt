Colony counts and total coliforms of the investigated biological treatment plant 
were decreased by more than 90% on average. In activated sludge processes the
colony counts increased, whereas total coliforms did not show significant
differences between raw sewage and activated sludge processes. With regard to the
antibiotics tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin raw sewage
samples contained on average 10(3) antibiotic resistant coliforms/ml. From agar
plates supplemented with antibiotics a total of 896 strains were characterized.
Single resistant E. coli strains (29.3%) were isolated most frequently from agar 
plates supplemented with tetracycline. However, coliforms isolated from agar
plates which were supplemented with chloramphenicol, kanamycin and gentamicin
showed a prevalent resistance to 5 and 6 antibiotics tested. The variety of
resistance patterns of gentamicin-resistant coliforms was determined by few
plasmids encoding gentamicin resistance only.
