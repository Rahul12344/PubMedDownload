BACKGROUND: Pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is a chronic progressive autoimmune bullous
disease caused by the interaction of pathogenic factors, genetic, and
environmental factors. HLA alleles, which are considered as protective factors
against disease or predisposing factors, may be different in various populations 
and ethnic groups.
AIMS: The purpose of this study is to examine the HLA-A, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ
alleles in patients that are diagnosed with PV in and around eastern of Turkey
and to determine the alleles that create predisposition to disease or protect
against the disease.
PATIENTS/METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed as PV with clinical,
histopathological, and immunofluorescence findings and 30 healthy subjects were
included in this study. The HLA-A, HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ typology in the DNA samples
that were obtained from the blood samples of the groups was performed by using
the PCR-SSP low-resolution gene panels.
RESULTS: The HLA-A*03 allele was found to be significantly higher in patient
group than the control group (P-value: .020). HLA-DRB1*04 and HLA-DRB1*14 alleles
in PV patients were found to be significantly higher than the control group
(P-value = .000).
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the HLA-DRB1*03, HLADQB1*02, and HLA-DQB1*06
alleles in and around eastern of Turkey showed protective effects against
pemphigus vulgaris. It was also concluded that the HLA-A*03, HLA-DRB1*04,
HLA-DRB1*14, HLA-DRB4, HLA-DQB1*03, and HLA-DQB1*05 alleles could cause
predisposition to the disease.
