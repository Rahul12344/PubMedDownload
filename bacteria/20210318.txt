Acetic acid bacteria, fermentative microorganisms of traditional foods, have
unique alkali-stable lipids (ASL), such as dihydroceramide which is a precursor
of sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are important components of the brain tissue. We 
examined the effect of oral administration of ASL in a rat model of dementia
(7-week-old, male) with a basal forebrain lesion. In a water maze test, the
dementia model rats demonstrated poor spatial orientation. The administration of 
ASL (165 or 1650 mg/kg of body weight per day, for 14 days) produced a
significant improvement in learning ability in the dementia model rats. In vitro 
experiments showed ASL had the ability to promote neurite outgrowth in
pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Among the ASL components, dihydroceramide has the 
most potent effect on the differentiation of PC12 cells. It is highly possible
that oral administration of dihydroceramide-containing ASL reverses the decline
in cognitive function in dementia.
