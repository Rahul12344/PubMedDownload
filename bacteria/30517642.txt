CONTEXT: Unique features of local immunity in thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy
(TAO) may affect disease progression.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between the orbital immune
microenvironment and TAO development.
DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: TAO and control orbital connective tissues were
collected.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Single-cell sequencing examined orbital lymphocytic
infiltrates. Multicolor flow cytometry explored the phenotypes of different cell 
subsets and in vitro models for cell functional studies. Coculture experiment and
western blotting assay were used to determine underlying mechanism of the
enhanced T helper 17 (Th17) cell pathway.
RESULTS: The TAO orbital microenvironment was composed of natural killer cells,
dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, plasma cells, and CD34+ orbital
fibroblasts, but few B cells. Increases in CD3+CD8- IL-17A-producing and
RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)γt-expressing T cells and in CD3+CD8-
IL-13-producing and GATA3-expressing T cells suggested Th17 and Th2 cell
responses in TAO orbits. Increased interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-producing and RORγt+Tbet+
T cells indicated a Th1-like phenotype of orbital-infiltrating Th17 cells. Higher
IL-23R and IL-1R expression and lower IL-21R expression were also observed on
Th17 cells in TAO orbits. Multivariate analyses revealed that the Th17 pathway
[IL-17A (P = 0.001), IFN-γ (P = 0.009), RORγt (P = 0.003), IL-23R (P = 0.033),
IL-21R (P = 0.019)], and Th2 pathway [IL-13 (P = 0.015), GATA3 (P = 0.012)] were 
associated with TAO. IL-17A, IL-23R, and IL-1R correlated with clinical activity 
score and visual acuity. CD34+ orbital fibroblasts exhibited distinct cell
surface marker expression and promoted IL-23R and IL-1R expression on T cells to 
facilitate the Th17-cell phenotype through prostaglandin E2-EP2/EP4-cAMP
signaling.
CONCLUSION: Our study addresses the importance of retroorbital immunity and
suggests possible means of disrupting TAO pathogenesis.
