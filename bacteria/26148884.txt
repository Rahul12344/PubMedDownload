En1, Nr2f1, Gpc4, Sfrp2, Shox2, Tbx15 and Thbd are among the genes involved in
development process of an organism in a number of tissues, in particular adipose 
tissue. Considering the involvement of isobutyl-methyl-xanthine (IBMX),
indomethacin, dexamethasone (DEX), triiodothyronine (T3), and insulin in
adipocyte differentiation, we propose that these differentiation-inducing agents 
may regulate differentiation in brown adipose tissue through a developmental
process. Stromavascular cells isolated from interscapular brown fat of mice were 
cultured in DMEM-LG medium. Proliferating brown preadipocytes were differentiated
in the presence of IBMX, indomethacin, DEX, T3 and insulin. Pref1 (marker of
proliferation stage) and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1, marker for differentiation
stage) were upregulated during proliferation and differentiation, respectively.
Relative expression of Pref1, UCP1 and developmental genes was determined in
different stages of adipogenesis. En1, Gpc4, Nr2f1, Sfrp2 and Shox2 were
upregulated during differentiation. Differentiation of preadipocytes in the
absence of IBMX, indomethacin, and DEX resulted in drastic reduction in fat
accumulation in differentiated adipocytes with simultaneous decrease in En1,
Gpc4, Nr2f1, Sfrp2, Shox2 and Tbx15 gene expression. T3 upregulated the
expression of En1, Gpc4, Sfrp2 and Tbx15 genes during differentiation and
downregulated Shox2 expression as compared to proliferated state. Insulin
upregulated the expression of Shox2.
