Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA) are two phospholipids
involved in signal transduction and in lipid biosynthesis in cells. LPA
acyltransferase (LPAAT), also known as 1-acyl sn-glycerol-3-phosphate
acyltransferase (1-AGPAT) (EC 2.3.1.51), catalyzes the conversion of LPA to PA.
Two human isoforms of LPAAT, designated as LPAAT-alpha (AGPAT1) and LPAAT-beta
(AGPAT2), have been extensively characterized. These two proteins contain
extensive sequence similarities to microbial, plant and animal LPAAT sequences.
LPAAT-alpha mRNA is uniformly expressed throughout most tissues with the highest 
level found in skeletal muscle; whereas LPAAT-beta is differentially expressed,
with the highest level found in heart and liver, and negligible level in brain
and placenta. The LPAAT-alpha gene is located on chromosome 6p21.3, an area
within the class III region of the major hiscompatibility complex (MHC) and the
LPAAT-beta gene is mapped to chromosome 9q34.3. Enhanced transcription of
LPAAT-beta is suggested for neoplasm of the female genital tract. Additionally,
ectopic LPAAT expression in certain cytokine-responsive cell lines can effect
amplification of cellular signaling processes, such as those leading to
enhancement of synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 from
cells following stimulation with interleukin-1beta; this suggests that the LPAAT 
genes represent candidates for affecting the development of certain cancers or
inflammation-associated diseases.
