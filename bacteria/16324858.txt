During an unusually long period of bad weather, several outbreaks of caprine
contagious agalactia (CCA) were reported in a number of flocks on the island of
Lanzarote (Canary Islands, Spain). Clinical and subclinical mastitis in lactating
goats and some cases of arthritis and pneumonia in kids were observed in the
affected flocks. Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capricolum was isolated as the main
causal agent of the outbreaks, associated with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides "large
colony type" (Mmm LC) in two flocks. This is the first report of an isolation of 
M. capricolum subsp. capricolum on the island of Lanzarote. The finding is of
epidemiological importance and could complicate plans to control the disease. The
significance of this mycoplasma species in association with CCA must now be
studied in detail.
