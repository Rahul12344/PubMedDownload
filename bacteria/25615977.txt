NAD+-reducing [NiFe] hydrogenases catalyze the oxidoreduction of dihydrogen
concomitant with the interconversion of NAD+ and NADH. Here, the isolation,
purification and crystallization of the NAD+-reducing [NiFe] hydrogenase from
Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus TH-1 are reported. Crystals of the NAD+-reducing
[NiFe] hydrogenase were obtained within one week from a solution containing
polyethylene glycol using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method and
micro-seeding. The crystal diffracted to 2.58 Å resolution and belonged to space 
group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=131.43, b=189.71, c=124.59 Å, β=109.42°.
Assuming the presence of two NAD+-reducing [NiFe] hydrogenase molecules in the
asymmetric unit, VM was calculated to be 2.2 Å3 Da(-1), which corresponds to a
solvent content of 43%. Initial phases were determined by the single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion method using the anomalous signal from the Fe atoms.
