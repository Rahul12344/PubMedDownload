The receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is essential for TCR signal
transduction. Substrates of CD45 include the protein tyrosine kinases p56(lck)
and p59(fyn), both of which have been shown to be enriched in detergent-insoluble
microdomains. Here we find that there is a cholesterol-dependent association
between CD45 and the raft-associated protein linker for activation of T cells,
suggesting that CD45 and linker for activation of T cells may colocalize in lipid
rafts. Consistent with this observation, we find that approximately 5% of total
CD45 can be detected in Triton X-100-insoluble buoyant fractions of sucrose
gradients, demonstrating that CD45 is not excluded from lipid rafts. Upon
stimulation of T cells with anti-CD3, there is a reduction in the amount of CD45 
found associating with lipid rafts. Our data suggest that CD45 is present in
lipid rafts in T cells before activation, perhaps to activate raft-associated
p56(lck), allowing membrane-proximal signaling events to proceed. Furthermore,
the reduction in CD45 content of lipid rafts after CD3 stimulation may serve to
limit the amounts of activated p56(lck) in rafts and thus possibly the duration
of T cell responses.
