This study assessed the effects of photobiomodulation (PBM) to cells previously
exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) and
epithelial cells (HaCaT) were seeded in wells of 24-well plates containing
complete culture medium (DMEM). After 24 h, the DMEM was replaced by serum-free
DMEM, and cells were exposed to LPS of Escherichia coli (E. coli) (10 μg mL-1 )
for 24, 48, and 72 h. The cells were subjected to specific parameters of
phototherapy (PT) (LASERTable-InGaAsP-780 ± 3 nm, 25 mW, 3 J cm-2 ). Cell
proliferation (alamarBlue® ), viability (Trypan Blue) and synthesis of CCL2
(ELISA) were evaluated. Data were statistically analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney test (α = 5%). Proliferation and viability of both cell lines
decreased after LPS treatment at 48 and 72 h. Enhanced synthesis of CCL2 by
gingival fibroblasts occurred at 24 h, while epithelial cells increased synthesis
of this chemokine at 48 and 72 h. PBM enhanced cell proliferation and viability
in a time-dependent manner for both cell lines exposed or not to LPS, while
synthesis of CCL2 by cells exposed to PT decreased over time. PBM caused
biomodulatory effects on gingival fibroblasts and epithelial cells previously
treated with LPS. These effects may decrease tissue inflammatory response and
accelerate wound healing of oral mucosal tissue.
