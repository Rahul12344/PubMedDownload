The CD1d-binding glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-GC) is a potent adjuvant that
activates NKT cells and in turn enhances T-dependent humoral immunity. Very
little is known about how NKT cells and the NKT follicular helper (NKTfh) subset 
influence the immune response to T-independent polysaccharides. In this study, we
used a Cre-Lox approach to generate mice devoid of the Bcl6 master transcription 
factor in CD4 lineage cells and thus devoid of NKTfh cells but not total NKT
cells. It was observed that α-GC-driven IgG1 class switch against a
polysaccharide Ag was dependent on the NKTfh subset. However, α-GC was unable to 
stimulate a polysaccharide-specific Ab recall response. It was observed that
NKT-derived IL-21 was able to exert limited influence on the IgG1 response and
was therefore likely to work in concert with other factors. This work shows that 
α-GC-driven NKTfh cells can direct polysaccharide-specific B cell responses by
promoting IgG1 class switch but do not provide signals needed for generation of
polysaccharide-specific B cell memory.
