Cancer stem/progenitor cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells involved 
in tumor initiation, resistance to therapy and metastasis. Targeting CSCs has
been considered as the key for successful cancer therapy. Ovatodiolide (Ova) is a
macrocyclic diterpenoid compound isolated from Anisomeles indica (L.) Kuntze with
anti-cancer activity. Here we used two human breast cancer cell lines (AS-B145
and BT-474) to examine the effect of Ova on breast CSCs. We first discovered that
Ova displayed an anti-proliferation activity in these two breast cancer cells.
Ova also inhibited the self-renewal capability of breast CSCs (BCSCs) which was
determined by mammosphere assay. Ova dose-dependently downregulated the
expression of stemness genes, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) and
Nanog, as well as heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), but upregulated SMAD ubiquitin
regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) in mammosphere cells derived from AS-B145 or BT-474.
Overexpression of Hsp27 or knockdown of SMURF2 in AS-B145 cells diminished the
therapeutic effect of ovatodiolide in the suppression of mammosphere formation.
In summary, our data reveal that Ova displays an anti-CSC activity through
SMURF2-mediated downregulation of Hsp27. Ova could be further developed as an
anti-CSC agent in the treatment of breast cancer.
