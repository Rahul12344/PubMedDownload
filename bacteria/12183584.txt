Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) lipooligosaccharide htrB mutants
exhibited greater than 45-fold-increased sensitivity to human beta-defensin 2
(HBD-2) compared to the wild type. Complementation by htrB in trans to acylation 
competence reversed this increased sensitivity. In contrast, NTHI was more
susceptible to HBD-3 and showed no changes in sensitivity as a result of
lipooligosaccharide mutations in oligosaccharide and lipid A biosynthesis genes.
