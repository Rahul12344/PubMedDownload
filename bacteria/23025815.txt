While the vast majority of glycosidases catalyze glycoside hydrolysis via
oxocarbenium ion-like transition states and typically employ carboxylic acid
residues as acid/base or nucleophile catalysts, two subfamilies of these enzymes 
(GH4 and GH109 in the CAZY classification) conduct hydrolysis via a
redox-assisted mechanism involving anionic transition states. While good evidence
of this mechanism has been obtained, the identities of the catalytic residues
involved have not yet been confirmed. Mechanistic analyses of mutants of the
6-phospho-Î²-glucosidase from Thermotoga maritima (BglT), in which the active site
tyrosine residue (Tyr 241) has been replaced with Phe and Ala, provide support
for its role as a catalytic base. The pH dependence of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m),
particularly of the acidic limb corresponding to the base, is shifted relative to
that of the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic isotope effects for hydrolysis of
substrates deuterated at C1, C2, and C3 by the Tyr 241 mutants are strongly
pH-dependent, with essentially full primary kinetic isotope effects being
observed for the 2-deutero substrate at low pH with the Tyr241Ala mutant. This is
consistent with a slowing of the deprotonation step upon removal of the base.
