Phosphorylation regulates the function of ligand-gated ion channels such as the
N-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Here we report a mechanism for modulation
of the phosphorylation state and function of the NMDA receptor via an inhibitory 
scaffolding protein, RACK1. We found that RACK1 binds both the NR2B subunit of
the NMDA receptor and the nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, Fyn. RACK1
inhibits Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B and decreases NMDA receptor-mediated
currents in CA1 hippocampal slices. Peptides that disrupt the interactions
between RACK1, NR2B, and Fyn induce phosphorylation and potentiate NMDA
receptor-mediated currents. Therefore, RACK1 is a regulator of NMDA receptor
function and may play a role in synaptic plasticity, addiction, learning, and
memory.
