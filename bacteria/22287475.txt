BACKGROUND: The incidence of odontogenic maxillary sinusitis (OMS) is unknown.
Failure to address dental pathology causing sinusitis can lead to failure of
medical and surgical treatments. The purpose of this article is to present an OMS
patient series.
METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively accrued patients. Sinusitis
guidelines were reviewed for OMS incidence and management. The clinical aspects
of OMS in 21 patients diagnosed by sinus computed tomography (CT) scan over the
last 30 months were assessed.
RESULTS: In our series the mean age was 53 years (range, 21-70 years), mean
duration of symptoms was 2.6 years (range, 1 month to 15 years), rotten smell or 
bad taste was present in 10 of 21 (48%) patients, dental pain was present in 6 of
21 (29%) patients, and unilateral maxillary opacification was present in 12 of 23
(57%) patients. Dental pathology was not noted in 6 of 7 (86%) of pre-CT dental
films and 14 of 21 (67%) of initial sinus CT reports but reevaluation of CT scans
found dental pathology in all patients.
CONCLUSION: Dental pathology causing sinusitis was frequently missed on plain
dental X-rays and CT scan reports. Dental pain and foul-smelling nasal discharge 
are present in less than one-half of patients and symptoms commonly persist for
years. Otolaryngologists must have a high index of suspicion for an odontogenic
cause of refractory maxillary sinusitis.
