Focus on the good, the bad and the unknown: genomics-enabled discovery of
plant-associated microbial processes and diversity.

[No authors listed]

MPMI has played a leading role in disseminating new insights into plant-microbe
interactions and promoting new approaches. Articles in this Focus Issue highlight
the power of genomic studies in uncovering novel determinants of plant
interactions with microbial symbionts (good), pathogens (bad), and complex
microbial communities (unknown). Many articles also illustrate how genomics can
support translational research by quickly advancing our knowledge of important
microbes that have not been widely studied. Click on Next Article or Table of
