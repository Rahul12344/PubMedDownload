[Observation of a pulmonary histoplasmosis with Histoplasma capsulatum (author's 
transl)].

[Article in French]

Sauvaget J, Drouhet E, Gagnebien S, Gacouin JC, Bargat F.

From an observation of pulmonary histoplasmosis with Histoplasma capsulatum in a 
Haiti woman living in France for 2 years, the authors recall the mycological and 
epidemiological data of this fungus as well as the main clinical radiological and
biological signs of the disease. Because of its tendancy to dissemination,
histoplasmosis can have a bad prognosis. It is difficult to diagnose in our
countries and facing a chronic pulmonary form, a diagnosis of tuberculosis is
often thought of. But its possibility is to be envisaged in case of a journey in 
countries of endemia, and the disease should be confirmed by: -- several
samplings to trace the fungus, bringing the mycological prove of the disease; -- 
serum uses; -- modalities and difficulties of the treatment by Amphotericin B are
also recalled.
