While the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1
(S1PR1) axis is critically important for lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs, 
S1PR1-activation also occurs in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), including those
of the high-endothelial venules (HEVs) that mediate lymphocyte immigration into
lymph nodes (LNs). To understand the functional significance of the S1P/S1PR1-Gi 
axis in HEVs, we generated Lyve1;Spns2Δ/Δ conditional knockout mice for the
S1P-transporter Spinster-homologue-2 (SPNS2), as HEVs express LYVE1 during
development. In these mice HEVs appeared apoptotic and were severely impaired in 
function, morphology and size; leading to markedly hypotrophic peripheral LNs.
Dendritic cells (DCs) were unable to interact with HEVs, which was also observed 
in Cdh5CRE-ERT2;S1pr1Δ/Δ mice and wildtype mice treated with S1PR1-antagonists.
Wildtype HEVs treated with S1PR1-antagonists in vitro and Lyve1-deficient HEVs
show severely reduced release of the DC-chemoattractant CCL21 in vivo. Together, 
our results reveal that EC-derived S1P warrants HEV-integrity through autocrine
control of S1PR1-Gi signaling, and facilitates concomitant HEV-DC interactions.
