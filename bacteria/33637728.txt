The precise spatiotemporal control of cell proliferation is key to the
morphogenesis of epithelial tissues. Epithelial cell divisions lead to tissue
crowding and local changes in force distribution, which in turn suppress the rate
of cell divisions. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this mechanical
feedback are largely unclear. Here, we identify a critical requirement of
B-plexin transmembrane receptors in the response to crowding-induced mechanical
forces during embryonic skin development. Epidermal stem cells lacking B-plexins 
fail to sense mechanical compression, resulting in disinhibition of the
transcriptional coactivator YAP, hyperproliferation, and tissue overgrowth.
Mechanistically, we show that B-plexins mediate mechanoresponses to crowding
through stabilization of adhesive cell junctions and lowering of cortical
stiffness. Finally, we provide evidence that the B-plexin-dependent
mechanochemical feedback is also pathophysiologically relevant to limit tumor
growth in basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer. Our data
define a central role of B-plexins in mechanosensation to couple cell density and
cell division in development and disease.
