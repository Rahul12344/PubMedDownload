OBJECTIVE: Necrotizing fasciitis is a life threatening soft-tissue infection with
a high morbidity and mortality. Prompt treatment based on extensive surgical
debridement and antibiotic therapies are the therapeutic principles.
METHODS: The medical records of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (n = 26) from
1996 to 2005 were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: The localization of necrotizing fasciitis was most commonly the trunk
(42.3 %). Type I polymicrobial infection was the dominating infection. The
involvement of anaerobic bacteria was associated with an increase in the number
of surgical revisions (p = 0.005). Length of postoperative intensive care unit
stay, duration of postoperative ventilation and mortality were significantly
increased in the ASA IV-V group. Computed tomography displayed only a limited
significance as diagnostic tool for initial diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: In severe cases the combination of necrotic skin and soft tissue gas
facilitates the correct diagnosis, which should than be followed by immediate -
and most often - repeated debridement. If anaerobes are isolated an early and
aggressive second look is necessary.
