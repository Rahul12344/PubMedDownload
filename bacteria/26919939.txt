OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the roselle calyx extract (RCE) (Hibiscus
sabdariffa L.) on the in vitro viability and biofilm formation ability of oral
pathogenic bacteria.
METHODS: RCE was prepared by soaking roselle calyx powder with ethyl alcohol for 
24 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the extract was lyophilized.
Then, the extract was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, the pH was
adjusted, and the extract was aseptically filtered. We used Streptococcus mutans,
Streptococcus sanguinis, Lactobacillus casei, Actinomyces naeslundii,
Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas
gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia in this study. The antibacterial activity of
the RCE was determined by treating the cells of these bacteria with the extract
for 10 or 20 min at room temperature. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 
and minimum bactericidal concentration was determined using the microdilution
method, and the effect of the RCE on the ability to form biofilm was determined
using a polystyrene micro plate assay. In addition, we used the WST-1 assay to
determine the cytotoxicity of the RCE on HGF, Ca9-22 and KB cells.
RESULTS: The RCE had antibacterial activity against oral bacteria used in this
study. In particular, most significant antibacterial activity was observed
against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia and Porphyromonas
gingivalis. The MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration were
7.2 mg/mL-28.8 mg/mL and 14.4 to >57.6 mg/mL. The RCE had an inhibitory effect on
biofilm formation at the MIC and sub-MIC levels. In addition, the RCE had low
cytotoxic effects on HGF, Ca9-22 and KB cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, our results indicate that the RCE may be used for preventing
oral diseases.
