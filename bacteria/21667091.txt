BACKGROUND: The urea cycle defect argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency has a 
large spectrum of presentations from highly severe to asymptomatic. Enzyme
activity assays in red blood cells or fibroblasts, although diagnostic of the
deficiency, fail to discriminate between severe, mild or asymptomatic cases.
Mutation/phenotype correlation studies are needed to characterize the effects of 
individual mutations on the activity of the enzyme.
METHODS: Bacterial in-vitro expression studies allowed the enzyme analysis of
purified mutant ASL proteins p.I100T (c.299 T > C), p.V178M (c.532 G > A),
p.E189G (c.566A > G), p.Q286R (c.857A > G), p.K315E (c.943A > G), p.R379C
(c.1135 C > T) and p.R385C (c.1153 C > T) in comparison to the wildtype protein.
RESULTS: In the bacterial in-vitro expression system, ASL wild-type protein was
successfully expressed. The known classical p.Q286R, the novel classical p.K315E 
and the known mutations p.I100T, p.E189G and p.R385C, which all have been linked 
to a mild phenotype, showed no significant residual activity. There was some
enzyme activity detected with the p.V178M (5 % of wild-type) and p.R379C (10 % of
wild-type) mutations in which K(m) values for argininosuccinic acid differed
significantly from the wild-type ASL protein.
CONCLUSION: The bacterially expressed enzymes proved that the mutations found in 
patients and studied here indeed are detrimental. However, as in the case of red 
cell ASL activity assays, some mutations found in genetically homozygous patients
with mild presentations resulted in virtual loss of enzyme activity in the
bacterial system, suggesting a more protective environment for the mutant enzyme 
in the liver than in the heterologous expression system and/or in the highly
dilute assays utilized here.
