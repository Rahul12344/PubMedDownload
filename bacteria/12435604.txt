The unambiguous assignment of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals of the
alpha-substituents of the haems in the tetrahaem cytochrome isolated from
Shewanella frigidimarina NCIMB400, was made using a combination of homonuclear
and heteronuclear experiments. The paramagnetic (13)C shifts of the nuclei
directly bound to the porphyrin of each haem group were analysed in the framework
of a model for the haem electronic structure. The analysis yields g-tensors for
each haem, which allowed the assignment of some electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) signals to specific haems, and the orientation of the magnetic axes
relative to each haem to be established. The orientation of the axial ligands of 
the haems was determined semi-empirically from the NMR data, and the structural
results were compared with those of the homologous tetrahaem cytochrome from
Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 showing significant similarities between the two
proteins.
