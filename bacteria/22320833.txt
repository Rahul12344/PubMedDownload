The RNA ligase RtcB is conserved in all domains of life and is essential for tRNA
maturation in archaea and metazoa. Here we show that bacterial and archaeal RtcB 
catalyze the GTP-dependent ligation of RNA with 3'-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl
termini. Reactions with analogues of RNA and GTP suggest a mechanism in which
RtcB heals the 3'-phosphate terminus by forming a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate before
joining it to the 5'-hydroxyl group of a second RNA strand. Thus, RtcB can ligate
RNA cleaved by RNA endonucleases, which generate 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and then 
3'-phosphate termini on one strand, and a 5'-hydroxyl terminus on another strand.
