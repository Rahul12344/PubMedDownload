Solid media on a base of B-12 or CB medium with agarose or agarose of low melting
temperature were developed for the cultivation of Microcystis species. The media 
with 0.4% gel showed the highest number of CFU, and increasing the gel
concentration resulted in a reduction of the number of CFU. There was no
difference in the numbers of CFU between pour and spread plates made of the solid
media. By using the solid media, 31 clones of Microcystis species were isolated
from natural blooms in Lake Kasumigaura, and 5 axenic strains (1 of M.
wesenbergii and 4 of M. aeruginosa) were established from the clones.
