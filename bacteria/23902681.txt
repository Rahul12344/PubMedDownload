BACKGROUND: Inflammasomes are multi-protein intracellular signaling complexes
that have recently been hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of the
inflammation response. We studied associations between inflammasome-associated
cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with bacterial
meningitis and clinical outcome, and pneumococcal serotype. In a murine model of 
pneumococcal meningitis we examined the pathophysiological roles of two
inflammasome proteins, NLRP3 (Nod-like receptor protein-3) and adaptor protein
ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein).
METHODS: In a nationwide prospective cohort study, CSF cytokine levels were
measured and related to clinical outcome and pneumococcal serotype. In a murine
model of pneumococcal meningitis using Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 3, we
examined bacterial titers, cytokine profiles and brain histology at 6 and 30
hours after inoculation in wild-type (WT), Asc and Nlrp3 deficient mice.
RESULTS: In patients with bacterial meningitis, CSF levels of inflammasome
associated cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 were related to complications, and
unfavorable disease outcome. CSF levels of IL-1β were associated with
pneumococcal serotype (p<0.001). In our animal model, Asc and Nlrp3 deficient
mice had decreased systemic inflammatory responses and bacterial outgrowth as
compared to WT mice. Differences between Asc⁻/⁻ and WT mice appeared sooner after
bacterial inoculation and were more widespread (lower pro-inflammatory cytokine
levels in both blood and brain homogenate) than in Nlrp3⁻/⁻ mice. Nlrp3
deficiency was associated with an increase of cerebral neutrophil infiltration
and cerebral hemorrhages when compared to WT controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results implicate an important role for inflammasome proteins
NLRP3 and ASC in the regulation of the systemic inflammatory response and the
development of cerebral damage during pneumococcal meningitis, which may
dependent on the pneumococcal serotype.
