DNA coding for the 16S rRNA of an intracellular bacterium was directly amplified 
from lysed cells of a host amoebae using the polymerase chain reaction and
primers specific for eubacteria. The amoebae had been used to recover an
uncultured bacterium observed in the sputum of a patient with pneumonia. The
amplified DNA was sequenced directly and compared with published 16S rRNA
sequences. The analysis revealed that the intracellular bacterium is a member of 
the genus Legionella and that it is different from species, including L.
pneumophila, for which 16S ribosomal RNA sequence data are available.
