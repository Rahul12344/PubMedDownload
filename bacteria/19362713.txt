Islet specific CD4 cells expressing inhibitory receptors may be a useful
therapeutic tool for treating type 1 diabetes (T1D). Engagement of transgenic
Ly49A inhibits CD4 cell activation and delays onset of T1D in mice. However, in
vitro studies suggest the inhibitory effect of Ly49A is incomplete. Here we
report that following simultaneous TCR and Ly49A engagement, phosphorylation of
Zap70, Erk1/2 and c-Jun were significantly diminished. Kinetic studies indicated 
that Ly49A did not simply delay activation but had a long-lasting effect. In
contrast, when only costimulatory signals were provided through CD28, Ly49A
engagement did not block p38 MapK or Akt phosphorylation. Likewise, expression of
the downstream targets Bcl-xl and Baff were unaffected. Together these data
suggest that engagement of Ly49A selectively inhibits signals downstream of the
TCR but spares those unique to CD28. These results suggest that when considering 
its use as an immunotherapy, the potency of inhibitory receptors such as Ly49A
may be further improved by pairing them with costimulatory blockade.
