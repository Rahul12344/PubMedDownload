Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex
and serious illness1, affecting 0.9-4% of women and 0.3% of men2-4, with
twin-based heritability estimates of 50-60%5. Mortality rates are higher than
those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here 
we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the
Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED)
and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa
and 55,525 controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture
of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant
genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic
(including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects
of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further
encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric
disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future 
research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may
be key to improving outcomes.
