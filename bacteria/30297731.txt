Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in
Germany. In 9/16 states, notification of erythema migrans (EM), acute
neuroborreliosis (NB) and Lyme arthritis (LA) is mandatory. We describe incidence
measures, time trends, geographical distribution and frequencies of
manifestations to better understand LB epidemiology and target prevention
measures. We used cases notified in the 9 states and confirmed by local health
offices, 2013-2017, to calculate incidences by time, place and person.
Altogether, we observed 56,446 cases. Disease onset peaked yearly in July.
Incidence ranged from 26/100,000 (2015) to 41/100,000 (2013) with mean annual
incidences 2013-2017 on district level between 0.5/100,000 and 138/100,000.
Median age was 54 years with peaks in boys (5-9 years, mean incidence 36/100,000)
and women (50-69 years, mean incidence 57/100,000). 95% experienced EM only, 2.7%
NB and 2.1% LA. 54% were female, but more men had NB (56%) and LA (53%,
p < 0.001). Hospitalisation was recorded for 10% of LA and 71% of NB cases. LB
remains an important public health concern in Germany with marked regional
variation. To facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, health authorities should
raise awareness among physicians and promote prevention strategies among the
general population: tick-bite-protection, prompt tick removal and medical
consultation.
