OBJECTIVES: Periodontitis is a highly prevalent chronic inflammatory disease
caused by periodontopathogens, such as Filifactor alocis. This study sought to
examine the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 synthesis by monocytic and
fibroblastic cells in response to F. alocis and to unravel the underlying
cellular mechanisms.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gingival biopsies from periodontally healthy and
periodontitis individuals were analyzed for the presence of F. alocis and MMP-1
by RT-PCR. Human gingival fibroblastic (HGF-1) and monocytic (THP-1) cells were
stimulated with F. alocis in the presence and absence of a blocking toll-like
receptor (TLR)2 antibody or specific inhibitors against MAPKs. MMP-1 expression
and protein levels were studied by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.
RESULTS: F. alocis was highly prevalent in biopsies from periodontitis patients
but barely present in the healthy gingiva. Significantly higher MMP-1 expression 
levels were found in the inflamed gingiva as compared with healthy biopsies. F.
alocis caused a significant and dose-dependent MMP-1 upregulation in both cells. 
The stimulatory effect of F. alocis on MMP-1 was TLR2- and MAPK-dependent and
more pronounced on THP-1 cells as compared with HGF-1 cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that F. alocis and MMP-1 are more prevalent 
at periodontitis sites. Additionally, our study provides original evidence that
F. alocis can stimulate MMP-1 production by fibroblastic and monocytic cells,
suggesting that F. alocis may contribute to periodontal breakdown through MMP-1.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: F. alocis and MMP-1 are linked to each other and key players 
in periodontitis, which may have significant implications for future diagnostic
and treatment strategies.
