Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis continues at high rates among
Greenland-born persons in Greenland and Denmark, with 203 and 450 notified cases 
per 10(5) population, respectively, in the year 2010. Here, we document that the 
predominant M. tuberculosis outbreak strain C2/1112-15 of Danish origin has been 
transmitted to Greenland-born persons in Denmark and subsequently to Greenland,
where it is spreading at worrying rates and adding to the already heavy
tuberculosis burden in this population group. It is now clear that the C2/1112-15
strain is able to gain new territories using a new population group as the
"vehicle." Thus, it might have the ability to spread even further, considering
the potential clinical consequences of strain diversity such as that seen in the 
widely spread Beijing genotype. The introduction of the predominant M.
tuberculosis outbreak strain C2/1112-15 into the Arctic circumpolar region is a
worrying tendency which deserves attention. We need to monitor whether this
strain already has, or will, spread to other countries.
