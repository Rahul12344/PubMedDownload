The human NDR family kinases control diverse aspects of cell growth, and are
regulated through phosphorylation and association with scaffolds such as MOB1.
Here, we report the crystal structure of the human NDR1 kinase domain in its
non-phosphorylated state, revealing a fully resolved atypically long activation
segment that blocks substrate binding and stabilizes a non-productive position of
helix αC. Consistent with an auto-inhibitory function, mutations within the
activation segment of NDR1 dramatically enhance in vitro kinase activity.
Interestingly, NDR1 catalytic activity is further potentiated by MOB1 binding,
suggesting that regulation through modulation of the activation segment and by
MOB1 binding are mechanistically distinct. Lastly, deleting the auto-inhibitory
activation segment of NDR1 causes a marked increase in the association with
upstream Hippo pathway components and the Furry scaffold. These findings provide 
a point of departure for future efforts to explore the cellular functions and the
mechanism of NDR1.
