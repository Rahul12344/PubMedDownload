Infection, commencing across a wide age range, with a live, attenuated strain of 
Salmonella typhimurium, will halt the development of type 1 diabetes in the NOD
mouse. The protective mechanism appears to involve the regulation of autoreactive
T cells in a manner associated with long lasting changes in the innate immune
compartment of these mice. We show in this study that autoreactive T cell priming
and trafficking are altered in mice that have been infected previously by S.
typhimurium. These changes are associated with sustained alterations in patterns 
of chemokine expression. We find that small numbers of dendritic cells from mice 
that have been previously infected with, but cleared all trace of a S.
typhimurium infection are able to prevent the development of diabetes in the
highly synchronized and aggressive cyclophosphamide-induced model. The effects we
observe on autoreactive T cell trafficking are recapitulated by the
immunomodulatory dendritic cell transfers in the cyclophosphamide model.
