The highly mutagenic A:8-oxoguanine (oxoG) base pair is generated mainly by
misreplication of the C:oxoG base pair, the oxidation product of the C:G base
pair. The A:oxoG base pair is particularly insidious because neither base in it
carries faithful information to direct the repair of the other. The bacterial
MutY (MUTYH in humans) adenine DNA glycosylase is able to initiate the repair of 
A:oxoG by selectively cleaving the A base from the A:oxoG base pair. The
difference between faithful repair and wreaking mutagenic havoc on the genome
lies in the accurate discrimination between two structurally similar base pairs: 
A:oxoG and A:T. Here we present two crystal structures of the MutY N-terminal
domain in complex with either undamaged DNA or DNA containing an intrahelical
lesion. These structures have captured for the first time a DNA glycosylase
scanning the genome for a damaged base in the very first stage of lesion
recognition and the base extrusion pathway. The mode of interaction observed here
has suggested a common lesion-scanning mechanism across the entire
helix-hairpin-helix superfamily to which MutY belongs. In addition, small angle
X-ray scattering studies together with accompanying biochemical assays have
suggested a possible role played by the C-terminal oxoG-recognition domain of
MutY in lesion scanning.
