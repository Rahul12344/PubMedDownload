Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells recognize glycolipid antigens presented
by CD1d, an antigen presenting protein structurally similar to MHC class I.
Stimulation of iNKT cells by glycolipid antigens can induce strong immune
responses in vivo, with rapid production of a wide variety of cytokines including
those classically associated with either T helper type 1 (Th1) or type 2 (Th2)
responses. Alterations in the lipid tails or other portions of CD1d-presented
glycolipid ligands can bias the iNKT response towards production of predominantly
Th1 or Th2 associated cytokines. However, the mechanism accounting for this
structure-activity relationship remains controversial. The Th1-biasing
glycolipids have been found to consistently form complexes with CD1d that
preferentially localize to plasma membrane cholesterol rich microdomains (lipid
rafts), whereas CD1d complexes formed with Th2-biasing ligands are excluded from 
these microdomains. Here we show that neutralization of endosomal pH enhanced
localization of CD1d complexes containing Th2-biasing glycolipids to plasma
membrane lipid rafts of antigen presenting cells (APC). Transfer of APCs
presenting these "stabilized" CD1d/αGC complexes into mice resulted in immune
responses with a more prominent Th1-like bias, characterized by increased NK cell
transactivation and interferon-γ production. These findings support a model in
which low endosomal pH controls stability and lipid raft localization of
CD1d-glycolipid complexes to regulate the outcome of iNKT cell mediated
responses.
