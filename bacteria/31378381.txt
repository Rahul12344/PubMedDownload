BACKGROUND: 40% of cases of infective endocarditis (IE) are likely caused by oral
bacteria. IE prevalence after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is
comparable to IE following surgical prosthetic valve replacement (SVR). Current
guidelines recommend pre-operative dental screening for SVR, without specific
recommendations regarding TAVR. We aimed to compare oral dental findings in TAVR 
vs. surgical valve replacement (SVR) candidates and assess the need for routine
dental screening and treatment prior to TAVR similar to the SVR patients.
METHODS: 150 patients (58 TAVR candidates and 92 surgical candidates) were all
referred for screening and appropriate treatment before intervention to our Oral 
medicine team, blinded to the planned interventional type. All patients were
scored for oral hygiene and dental findings that required intervention. An oral
health score (OHS, general hygiene: 0-good, 1-bad, need for immediate treatment: 
0-no, 1-yes, need for future treatment: 0-no, 1-yes) was calculated and compared.
Patients were clinically followed for IE for 14 ± 5 months (rage 8-28) post
intervention.
RESULTS: While candidates for SVR were younger than TAVR (66 + 10 vs. 81 ± 6
respectively, P < 0.0001), oral-dental findings were similar. OHS was 1.6 for SVR
and 1.7 for TAVR candidates, p = 0.45). Half of patients in either group had
findings requiring pre-procedural dental treatment. There were two IE cases
during follow-up, one in each group.
CONCLUSION: Oral health and need for pre-procedural dental treatment were not
different among candidates for SVR and TAVR. IE preventive oral-dental care seems
to be justified in patients undergoing TAVR initially denied SVR due to
prohibitive operative risk.
