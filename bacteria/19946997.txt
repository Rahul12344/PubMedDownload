Acute bacterial parotitis (ABP) in elderly is clinically described with a sudden 
onset of painfull swelling over the cheek and angle of the mandible. The occur of
ABP is a factor of very bad prognosis, often an indicator of approaching death.
In this paper we discuss eight cases observed in our geriatric clinic. To reduce 
the frequency of ABP in old and frail people, we must be careful about their oral
hygiene and dentition, increase their hydration and reduce their use of
anticholinergic drugs.
