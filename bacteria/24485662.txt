Tumor-propagating cells in acute leukemia maintain a stem/progenitor-like
immature phenotype and proliferative capacity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) originate from different lineages through 
distinct oncogenic events such as MLL fusions and Notch signaling, respectively. 
We found that Zfx, a transcription factor that controls hematopoietic stem cell
self-renewal, controls the initiation and maintenance of AML caused by MLL-AF9
fusion and of T-ALL caused by Notch1 activation. In both leukemia types, Zfx
prevents differentiation and activates gene sets characteristic of immature cells
of the respective lineages. In addition, endogenous Zfx contributes to gene
induction and transformation by Myc overexpression in myeloid progenitors. Key
Zfx target genes include the mitochondrial enzymes Ptpmt1 and Idh2, whose
overexpression partially rescues the propagation of Zfx-deficient AML. These
results show that distinct leukemia types maintain their undifferentiated
phenotype and self-renewal by exploiting a common stem-cell-related genetic
regulator.
