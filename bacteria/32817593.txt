BACKGROUNDPatients with diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), including diffuse
intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), have dismal outcomes. We previously described
the H3.3K27M mutation as a shared neoantigen in HLA-A*02.01+, H3.3K27M+ DMGs.
Within the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, we assessed the safety
and efficacy of an H3.3K27M-targeted peptide vaccine.METHODSNewly diagnosed
patients, aged 3-21 years, with HLA-A*02.01+ and H3.3K27M+ status were enrolled
in stratum A (DIPG) or stratum B (nonpontine DMG). Vaccine was administered in
combination with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-poly-I-lysine
carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles, followed by once
every 6 weeks. Immunomonitoring and imaging were performed every 3 months.
Imaging was centrally reviewed. Immunological responses were assessed in PBMCs
using mass cytometry.RESULTSA total of 19 patients were enrolled in stratum A
(median age,11 years) and 10 in stratum B (median age, 13 years). There were no
grade-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Injection site reaction was the
most commonly reported TRAE. Overall survival (OS) at 12 months was 40% (95% CI, 
22%-73%) for patients in stratum A and 39% (95% CI, 16%-93%) for patients in
stratum B. The median OS was 16.1 months for patients who had an expansion of
H3.3K27M-reactive CD8+ T cells compared with 9.8 months for their counterparts (P
= 0.05). Patients with DIPG with below-median baseline levels of myeloid-derived 
suppressor cells had prolonged OS compared with their counterparts (P < 0.01).
Immediate pretreatment dexamethasone administration was inversely associated with
H3.3K27M-reactive CD8+ T cell responses.CONCLUSIONAdministration of the
H3.3K27M-specific vaccine was well tolerated. Patients with H3.3K27M-specific
CD8+ immunological responses demonstrated prolonged OS compared with
nonresponders.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT02960230.FUNDINGThe V
