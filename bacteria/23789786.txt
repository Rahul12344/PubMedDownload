AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate biosurfactant production by a novel
marine Rhodococcus sp., strain PML026 and characterize the chemical nature and
properties of the biosurfactant.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A novel marine bacterium (Rhodococcus species; strain
PML026) was shown to produce biosurfactant in the presence of hydrophobic
substrate (sunflower oil). Biosurfactant production (identified as a
trehalolipid) was monitored in whole-batch cultures (oil layer and aqueous
phase), aqueous phase (no oil layer) and filtered (0·2 μm) aqueous phase (no oil 
or cells; extracellular) and was shown to be closely associated with
growth/biomass production. Extracellular trehalolipid levels increased postonset 
of stationary growth phase. Purified trehalolipid was able to reduce the surface 
tension of water to 29 mN m(-1) at Critical Micellar Concentration (CMC) of c.
250 mg l(-1) and produced emulsions that were stable to a wide range of
conditions (pH 2-10, temperatures of 20-100°C and NaCl concentrations of 5-25%
w/v). Separate chemical analyses of the intact trehalolipid and its constituents 
demonstrated the compound was in fact a mixture of homologues (>1180 MW)
consisting of a trehalose moiety esterified to a series of straight chain and
hydroxylated fatty acids.
CONCLUSIONS: The trehalolipid biosurfactant produced by the novel marine strain
Rhodococcus sp. PML026 was characterized and exhibited high surfactant activity
under a wide range of conditions.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Strain PML026 of Rhodococcus sp. is a potential
candidate for bioremediation or biosurfactant production for various
applications.
