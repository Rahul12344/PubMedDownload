The Ly49E receptor is preferentially expressed on murine innate-like lymphocytes,
such as epidermal Vγ3 T cells, intestinal intraepithelial CD8αα+ T lymphocytes,
and CD49a+ liver natural killer (NK) cells. As the latter have recently been
shown to be distinct from conventional NK cells and have innate lymphoid cell
type 1 (ILC1) properties, we investigated Ly49E expression on intestinal ILC
populations. Here, we show that Ly49E expression is very low on known ILC
populations, but it can be used to define a previously unrecognized
intraepithelial innate lymphoid population. This Ly49E-positive population is
negative for NKp46 and CD8αα, expresses CD49a and CD103, and requires T-bet
expression and IL-15 signaling for differentiation and/or survival. Transcriptome
analysis reveals a group 1 ILC gene profile, different from NK cells, iCD8α
cells, and intraepithelial ILC1. Importantly, NKp46-CD8αα-Ly49E+ cells produce
interferon (IFN)-γ, suggesting that this previously unrecognized population may
contribute to Th1-mediated immunity.
