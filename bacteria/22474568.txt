Bacillus anthracis, the agent of anthrax, has gained virulence through its
exotoxins produced by vegetative bacilli and is composed of three components
forming lethal toxin (LT) and edema toxin (ET). So far, little is known about the
effects of these toxins on the eukaryotic cytoskeleton. Here, we provide an
overview on the general effects of toxin upon the cytoskeleton architecture.
Thus, we shall discuss how anthrax toxins interact with their receptors and may
disrupt the interface between extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. We then 
analyze what toxin molecular effects on cytoskeleton have been described, before 
discussing how the cytoskeleton may help the pathogen to corrupt general cell
processes such as phagocytosis or vascular integrity.
