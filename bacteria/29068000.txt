Dectin-1 (gene symbol: Clec7a) is a receptor for β-glucans that play an important
role for the host defense against fungi. Recently, we showed that Clec7a-/- mice 
are resistant against dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis because of
regulatory T-cell population expansion in the colon. The regulatory T-cell
expansion is caused by expansion of commensal Lactobacillus murinus whose growth 
is suppressed by an antimicrobial protein, calprotectin S100A8/A9. In this
report, we showed that S100A8 was mainly produced by mouse colonic epithelial
cells. S100A8 was not induced directly by Dectin-1 but by Dectin-1-induced
cytokines, especially interleukin-17F (IL-17F), that were produced by several
types of innate immune cells including CD11c+/CD11b+ myeloid cells in colonic
lamina propria. S100A8/A9 heterodimer preferentially suppressed the growth of L. 
murinus that was increased in both Clec7a-/- and Il17f-/- mice. Furthermore,
similar expansion of L. murinus and DSS-colitis resistance were observed in mice 
fed with β-glucan-free food. These observations suggest that food-derived
β-glucans control the specific commensal microbiota via the
Dectin-1-IL-17F-calprotectin axis to maintain the intestinal homeostasis.
