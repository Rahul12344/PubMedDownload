BACKGROUND: Melioidosis, caused by bioterror treat agent Burkholderia
pseudomallei, is an important cause of community-acquired Gram-negative sepsis in
Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. New insights into the pathogenesis of
melioidosis may help improve treatment and decrease mortality rates from this
dreadful disease. We hypothesized that changes in Von Willebrand factor (VWF)
function should occur in melioidosis, based on the presence of endothelial
stimulation by endotoxin, pro-inflammatory cytokines and thrombin in melioidosis,
and investigated whether this impacted on outcome.
METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recruited 52 controls and 34 culture-confirmed
melioidosis patients at Sappasithiprasong Hospital in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand.
All subjects were diabetic. Platelet counts in melioidosis patients were lower
compared to controls (p = 0.0001) and correlated with mortality (p = 0.02). VWF
antigen levels were higher in patients (geometric mean, 478 U/dl) compared to
controls (166 U/dL, p<0.0001). The high levels of VWF in melioidosis appeared to 
be due to increased endothelial stimulation (VWF propeptide levels were elevated,
p<0.0001) and reduced clearance (ADAMTS13 reduction, p<0.0001). However, VWF
antigen levels did not correlate with platelet counts implying that
thrombocytopenia in acute melioidosis has an alternative cause.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Thrombocytopenia is a key feature of melioidosis and is
correlated with mortality. Additionally, excess VWF and ADAMTS13 deficiency are
features of acute melioidosis, but are not the primary drivers of
thrombocytopenia in melioidosis. Further studies on the role of thrombocytopenia 
in B. pseudomallei infection are needed.
