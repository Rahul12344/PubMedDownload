Five water-soluble O-quaternary ammonium salt-chitosans (QAS-CS) bearing
N-methyl-N-R-N, N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ammonium bromides (R=-benzyl (chloride,
BNQAS-CS), -dodecyl (C12QAS-CS), -tetradecyl (C14QAS-CS), -hexadecyl (C16QAS-CS),
-octadecyl (C18QAS-CS)) were prepared, respectively. They were characterized by
FTIR, (1)H NMR and elemental analysis. Through chemical modification of
O-quaternized chitosans, the water solubility of all QAS-CS was improved
distinctly. Their antibacterial properties indicate good antibacterial abilities 
against gram-positive bacteria and bad against gram-negative bacteria, therein,
C12QAS-CS and C14QAS-CS are the best. More importantly, their cytotoxicity was
markedly lower than the corresponding QAS monomers by evaluating for AT2 cell
line using CCK-8 assay. The strategy provides a facile way to design and develop 
new types of antibacterial chitosan materials with better water solubility,
better antimicrobial ability and lower cytotoxicity for primary additive agent of
self-owned intellectual band-aids.
