RATIONALE: Myeloid-related protein-8 (MRP8) and MRP14 can form heterodimers that 
elicit a variety of inflammatory responses. We showed that MRP8/14 is a ligand
for Toll-like receptor-4, and that mice deficient in MRP8/14 are protected
against endotoxic shock-induced lethality.
OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) the extent of MRP8/14 release in patients with
sepsis and/or peritonitis and in healthy humans exposed to LPS and (2) the
contribution of MRP8/14 to the host response in murine abdominal sepsis.
METHODS: MRP8/14 was measured in 51 patients with severe sepsis, 8 subjects after
intravenous injection of LPS, and 17 patients with peritonitis. Host responses to
sepsis were compared in mrp14 gene-deficient (and thereby MRP8/14-deficient) and 
wild-type mice intraperitoneally injected with Escherichia coli.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with sepsis displayed elevated
circulating MRP8/14 concentrations on both Days 0 and 3, and LPS injection
resulted in systemic MRP8/14 release in healthy humans. In patients with
peritonitis, MRP8/14 levels in abdominal fluid were more than 15-fold higher than
in plasma. MRP14-deficient mice displayed improved defense against E. coli
abdominal sepsis in an early phase, as indicated by diminished dissemination of
the bacteria at 6 hours. In addition, MRP14-deficient mice demonstrated decreased
systemic inflammation, as reflected by lower cytokine plasma concentrations, and 
less severe liver damage.
CONCLUSIONS: Human sepsis and endotoxemia are associated with enhanced release of
MRP8/14. In abdominal sepsis, MRP8/14 likely occurs primarily at the site of the 
infection, facilitating bacterial dissemination at an early phase and liver
injury.
