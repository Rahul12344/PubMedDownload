R27, a large conjugative plasmid of the HI incompatibility group, was subjected
to a subcloning analysis which revealed the presence of a Poll-independent
replicon and determinants contributing to incompatibility within a 2.7 kb
SalI/XbaI fragment. The DNA sequence of the minimal replicon revealed the
presence of a large open reading frame (ORF) as well two sets of 19 bp repeated
oligonucleotides (iterons), in addition to characteristic Escherichia coli origin
elements. The protein encoded by the ORF possesses homology with replication
initiator proteins encoded by a number of plasmids from different incompatibility
groups. Deletion analysis suggested that the iterons are responsible for
incompatibility reactions. Dissection of the replicon confirmed this and defined 
a minimal origin of 230 bp. The putative replication initiator was expressed in
an in vitro transcription-translation system, and the 5' end of the mRNA encoding
its synthesis was identified. Transcriptional fusion of the repA promoter to lacZ
demonstrated an autoregulatory function of RepA. A series of iterons present
downstream of the RepA coding sequence are dispensable but are responsible for
copy-number control. The minimal replicon appears to be partition-defective.
