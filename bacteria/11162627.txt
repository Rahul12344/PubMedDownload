Using the reverse transcription PCR, we evaluated expression levels of various
antigen presentation-related genes, including LMP2, LMP7, MECL-1, PA28alpha,
PA28beta, TAP1, TAP2, and tapasin, in two oral squamous cell carcinoma cell
lines, HSC5 and HSC7. Expression levels of LMP2, MECL-1, TAP1, and TAP2
transcripts are reduced in both cell lines in comparison with a normal epithelial
cell line. Further, HSC5 and HSC7 show diminished expression of LMP7/tapasin, and
PA28alpha/beta, respectively. Surface expression of HLA-B alleles is
down-regulated in both lines presumably due to low expression of TAP1/2. However,
HLA-A2 surface expression is not significantly down-regulated in HSC5 cells,
suggesting an involvement of signal-sequence derived peptides in the
TAP-independent pathway. The current study would contribute to our understanding 
of significance of abnormalities in the antigen presentation machinery of oral
squamous cell carcinoma, and provide meaningful information in the design of
CTL-based tumor vaccines by intra-cellular delivery system.
