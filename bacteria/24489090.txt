Rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders are associated with altered
activity of the immunomodulatory enzyme IDO. However, the precise contributions
of IDO function to autoimmunity remain unclear. In this article, we examine the
effect of two different IDO enzymes, IDO1 and IDO2, on the development of
autoimmune arthritis in the KRN preclinical model of rheumatoid arthritis. We
find that IDO2, not IDO1, is critical for arthritis development, providing direct
evidence of separate in vivo functions for IDO1 and IDO2. Mice null for Ido2
display decreased joint inflammation relative to wild-type mice owing to a
reduction in pathogenic autoantibodies and Ab-secreting cells. Notably, IDO2
appears to specifically mediate autoreactive responses, but not normal B cell
responses, as total serum Ig levels are not altered and IDO2 knockout mice are
able to mount productive Ab responses to model Ags in vitro and in vivo.
Reciprocal adoptive transfer studies confirm that autoantibody production and
arthritis are modulated by IDO2 expression in a cell type extrinsic to the T
cell. Taken together, our results, provide important insights into IDO2 function 
by defining its pathogenic contributions to autoantibody-mediated autoimmunity.
