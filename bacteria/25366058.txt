BACKGROUND: During pneumonia, inflammation and coagulation are activated as part 
of anti-bacterial host defense. Activated protein C (APC) has anticoagulant and
anti-inflammatory properties and until recently was a registered drug for the
treatment of severe sepsis. Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae is the most common
causative pathogen in community-acquired pneumonia.
METHODS: We aimed to investigate the effect of high APC levels during
experimental pneumococcal pneumonia. Wild type (WT) and APC overexpressing
(APC(high))-mice were intranasally infected with S. pneumoniae and sacrificed
after 6, 24 or 48 hours, or followed in a survival study.
RESULTS: In comparison to WT mice, APC(high)-mice showed decreased bacterial
dissemination to liver and spleen, while no differences in bacterial loads were
detected at the primary site of infection. Although no differences in the extent 
of lung histopathology were seen, APC(high)-mice showed a significantly decreased
recruitment of neutrophils into lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Activation of coagulation was not altered in APC(high)-mice. No differences in
survival were observed between WT and APC(high)-mice (P =0.06).
CONCLUSION: APC overexpression improves host defense during experimental
pneumococcal pneumonia. This knowledge may add to a better understanding of the
regulation of the inflammatory and procoagulant responses during severe
Gram-positive pneumonia.
