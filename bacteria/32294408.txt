Mucociliary clearance through coordinated ciliary beating is a major innate
defense removing pathogens from the lower airways, but the pathogen sensing and
downstream signaling mechanisms remain unclear. We identified
virulence-associated formylated bacterial peptides that potently stimulated
ciliary-driven transport in the mouse trachea. This innate response was
independent of formyl peptide and taste receptors but depended on key taste
transduction genes. Tracheal cholinergic chemosensory cells expressed these
genes, and genetic ablation of these cells abrogated peptide-driven stimulation
of mucociliary clearance. Trpm5-deficient mice were more susceptible to infection
with a natural pathogen, and formylated bacterial peptides were detected in
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Optogenetics and peptide
stimulation revealed that ciliary beating was driven by paracrine cholinergic
signaling from chemosensory to ciliated cells operating through muscarinic M3
receptors independently of nerves. We provide a cellular and molecular framework 
that defines how tracheal chemosensory cells integrate chemosensation with innate
defense.
