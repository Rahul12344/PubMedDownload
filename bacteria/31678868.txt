Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in organizing the effective immune
response through inducing the pro-inflammatory cytokines for control of
tuberculosis infection and TLR polymorphisms are associated with altered cytokine
levels have been described. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to
confirm whether TLR2 (C2029T, G2258A) polymorphisms effects the cytokine
production in PTB patients and Household contacts (HHC), healthy controls (HC).
The polymorphisms were performed by amplification refractory mutation
system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS) & Restriction Fragment Length
Polymorphism (RFLP) in 336 subjects. Cytokine levels were estimated in Pam3CSK4, 
antigen ESAT-6 stimulated culture supernatants by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay. Under the over-dominant model GA genotype of G2258A SNP and CT genotype of
the co-dominant model in C2029T SNP showed a susceptible effect in patients,
whereas in HHC, CT genotype showed a protective effect. A significant decreased
TNF-α, IL-12 and increased IL-1β levels were observed after Pam3CSK4, antigen
ESAT-6stimulation; our results showed the following associations: TLR2 G2258A SNP
of GA with decreased TNF-α; TLR2 C2029T SNP of CT, TT with decreased IL-12 and
increased IL-1β levels. Regression analysis demonstrated that age, BCG, gender
and T allele were significantly associated with TB. Pre-mRNA secondary structure 
of the A, T alleles are more stable than G, C alleles. Altogether, we suggest
that cytokine levels, 2029T allele, TLR2 polymorphisms were considered as
predictive markers for identification of high-risk individuals in TB.
