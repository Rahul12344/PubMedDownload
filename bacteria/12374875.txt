BACKGROUND: The innate immune system of human skin contains antimicrobial
peptides known as cathelicidins (LL-37) and beta-defensins. In normal skin these 
peptides are negligible, but they accumulate in skin affected by inflammatory
diseases such as psoriasis. We compared the levels of expression of LL-37 and
human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in inflamed skin from patients with atopic
dermatitis and from those with psoriasis.
METHODS: The expression of LL-37 and HBD-2 protein in skin-biopsy specimens from 
patients with psoriasis, patients with atopic dermatitis, and normal subjects was
determined by immunohistochemical analysis. The amount of antimicrobial peptides 
in extracts of skin samples was also analyzed by immunodot blot analysis (for
LL-37) and Western blot analysis (for HBD-2). Quantitative, real-time
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays were used to
confirm the relative expression of HBD-2 and LL-37 messenger RNA (mRNA) in the
skin-biopsy specimens. These peptides were also tested for antimicrobial activity
against Staphylococcus aureus with the use of a colony-forming assay.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the presence of abundant LL-37
and HBD-2 in the superficial epidermis of all patients with psoriasis. In
comparison, immunostaining for these peptides was significantly decreased in
acute and chronic lesions from patients with atopic dermatitis (P=0.006 and
P=0.03, respectively). These results were confirmed by immunodot blot and Western
blot analyses. Real-time RT-PCR showed significantly lower expression of HBD-2
mRNA and LL-37 mRNA in atopic lesions than in psoriatic lesions (P=0.009 and
P=0.02, respectively). The combination of LL-37 and HBD-2 showed synergistic
antimicrobial activity by effectively killing S. aureus.
CONCLUSIONS: A deficiency in the expression of antimicrobial peptides may account
for the susceptibility of patients with atopic dermatitis to skin infection with 
S. aureus.
