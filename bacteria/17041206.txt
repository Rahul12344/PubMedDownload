Visceral involvement in absence of lymphadenopathy is a rare manifestation in cat
scratch disease; hepatic granulomas are rare, representing 0.3% of systemic
manifestations of cat scratch disease, and gallbladder extension is a singular
case. The present article refers to 2 rare cases of visceral cat scratch disease 
in immunocompetent adults with hepatic granulomatous inflammation, caused by
Bartonella henselae infection, with gallbladder involvement in 1 case and no
lymphadenopathy. Histological features demonstrated the presence of inflammatory 
necrotizing granulomatous nonneoplastic process. Molecular studies (polymerase
chain reaction) were performed to confirm the infectious etiology.
