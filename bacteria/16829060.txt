Using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique we prepared substrate supported
well-defined lipid/phospholipid (1-mono-palmitoyl-rac-glycerol
(MPG)/l,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DPPC)) bilayers in which the 
MPG lipid leaflet was exposed to the aqueous phase. Hydrolysis of MPG performed
by Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) on the upper MPG layer of these supported bilayers
on mica was imaged by real time atomic force microscope (AFM) using a liquid
cell, so that the area increase of the initial structural defects could be
followed over time. Our data strongly suggest that the edges of the initial
structural defects are the preferred activation sites for CRL once the enzyme is 
adsorbed onto these interfaces. When a 2.5nM bulk concentration of CRL was
assayed on this planar lipid substrate, we found a long lag phase before a sharp 
increase of catalytic activity. The lag-burst kinetic behaviour was related to
the interfacial activation phenomenon although we propose that it is also
dependent on the gel-phase state of this interface.
