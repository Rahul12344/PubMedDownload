PURPOSE: Human ocular surface epithelia express four antimicrobial peptides
(APs): beta -defensin (hBD) 1-3 and LL-37. Here the expression of additional APs 
(hBD 4-6, HE2beta 1; histatin-1, -3; liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-1, -2;
macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-3alpha, and thymosin (T)beta -4) was sought
and activity against common ocular pathogens studied.
METHODS: AP expression was determined in human corneal and conjunctival
epithelial cells (HCEC, HCjEC) by RT-PCR and in corneal sections by
immunostaining. Antimicrobial assays were performed to assess peptide (hBD 1-3,
LL-37, MIP-3alpha, and Tbeta 4) activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA),
Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) in the presence
of NaCl or tears.
RESULTS: HCEC and HCjEC expressed MIP-3alpha and Tbeta 4. hBD 1-3, MIP-3alpha,
and Tbeta 4 showed activity against PA. hBD-3 had potent activity against SA and 
SE, whereas hBD-2, MIP-3alpha and Tbeta 4 had moderate activity and hBD-1 had
none. NaCl markedly attenuated, and tears almost completely inhibited the
activity of hBD 1-2 and Tbeta 4, but not that of hBD-3.
CONCLUSIONS: The ocular surface epithelia additionally express MIP-3alpha and
Tbeta 4 which have moderate antimicrobial activity. The current data support a
role for hBD-3 as an antimicrobial peptide in vivo, but call in to question the
effectiveness of some other APs. However, further study is required to
conclusively elucidate the physiological role of each AP.
