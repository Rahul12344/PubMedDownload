BACKGROUND: An important agent of food intoxication is Staphylococcus aureus,
that is able to produce enterotoxins.
AIM: To detect Staphylococcus aureus contamination in cafeteria food handlers of 
a Chilean University.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Nose, throat, hands and nail samples from 87 food handlers 
were obtained for microbiological examination.
RESULTS: Fifty seven subjects (65.5%) were carriers of Staphylococcus aureus.
Enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus was found in 36 subjects (41%). The most
frequently found enterotoxin was type B (18 samples) followed by type D (12
samples). Men bad a higher frequency of contamination than women (83 and 57% of
positive samples respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus contamination among food
handlers is high and should prompt personal and environmental hygienic measures.
