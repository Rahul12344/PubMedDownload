Purulent pericarditis is a life-threatening disease that usually manifests
following bacteraemia or through spreading from an intrathoracic focus. Only a
few cases of this disease have been reported with Lancefield group C streptococci
as aetiological agents, and the primary focus in these infections remains
unknown. We report a case of purulent pericarditis with septic and cardiogenic
shock, caused by Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (group C) in a
51-year-old patient. The pathogen was possibly contracted through contact with
horses. Most probably, it caused initially pneumonia before spreading to the
pericardium, either directly or via the bloodstream. A combined therapeutic
approach, consisting of antibiotic therapy and repeated pericardial drainage, was
necessary to ensure a clinical cure. After discharge, long-term follow-up for
development of constrictive pericarditis is considered mandatory.
