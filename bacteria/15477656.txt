Natural killer T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes that share
receptor structures and properties with conventional T lymphocytes and natural
killer (NK) cells. NKT cells are specific for glycolipid antigens such as the
marine sponge-derived agent alpha-galactosylceramide (alpha-GalCer) presented by 
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like molecule CD1d. My
laboratory has evaluated the function of NKT cells by generating and analyzing
CD1d-deficient mice. These studies showed that CD1d expression is required for
NKT cell development, but not absolutely necessary for the generation of
polarized T helper (Th) cell responses. Further, we have studied the in vivo
response of NKT cells to alpha-GalCer stimulation and the capacity of
alpha-GalCer to modulate innate and adaptive immune responses. Our results
revealed that, quickly following administration of alpha-GalCer, NKT cells expand
and produce cytokines, trans-activate a variety of innate and adaptive immune
cells, and promote Th2 responses that are capable of suppressing Th1-dominant
autoimmunity. Our findings indicate that NKT cells play a regulatory role in the 
immune response and that specific activation of these cells may be exploited for 
therapeutic purposes.
