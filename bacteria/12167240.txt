The aim of this article is to review our current understanding of the role of
cytokines, chemokines, T cells, Langerhans cells, and neutrophils (PMN) and their
interactions in vivo in the host response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ocular
challenge. The cellular/cytokine network in vivo has begun to be unraveled, and
the data discussed provide substantive evidence for a regulatory role of CD4(+) T
cells (Th1 type) contributing directly to persistence of PMN in the cornea of
susceptible C57BL/6 (cornea perforates) versus resistant BALB/c (cornea heals)
mice. Additionally, in the susceptible mouse model, CD4(+) T cells interact with 
Langerhans cells and B7/CD28 ligation appears critical for antigen presentation
and the susceptibility response. Various cytokines and chemokines (e.g.,
MIP-1alpha, IL-1beta, MIP-2, IL-12, and IFN-gamma) and their pattern of sustained
upregulation after infection in susceptible versus resistant mice also will be
discussed in light of an in vivo cytokine network. T-cell-mediated pathogenic
mechanisms are of importance in development of the susceptible response to P.
aeruginosa ocular infection. In the absence of T-cell infiltration into the
cornea, PMN do not persist in the stroma, and cytokines and chemokines are better
balanced, resulting in decreased stromal destruction and the resistance response.
