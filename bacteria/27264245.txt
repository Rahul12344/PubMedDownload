Streptomyces albus J1074 is a well-known host for heterologous expression of
secondary metabolites. To further increase its potential and to study the
influence of cluster multiplication, additional φC31-attachment site was
integrated into its genome using a system for transposon mutagenesis. Four
secondary metabolite clusters were expressed in strains with different numbers of
attachment sites, ranging from one to three copies of the site. Secondary
metabolite production was examined and a new compound could be detected, purified
and its structure was elucidated.
