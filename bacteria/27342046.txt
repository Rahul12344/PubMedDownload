BACKGROUND: Preterm delivery is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and death. 
It often results from chorioamnionitis, which is a complication of bacterial
vaginosis. Probiotics are effective in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis in
women who were not pregnant; studies in pregnant woman are missing.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether an oral probiotic
food supplement supports the maintenance or restoration of a normal vaginal
microbiota during pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, triple-blind,
parallel group trial. Oral Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1and L reuteri RC-14 (109
colony-forming units) or placebo were administered for 8 weeks to women with <12 
completed weeks of pregnancy. Participants were enrolled at Tuebingen University 
Hospital and 10 recruiting gynecologic practices. Vaginal swabs were taken before
and after intervention and analyzed according to the Nugent scoring system.
Telephone interviews were performed before and after intervention and after
delivery. Primary outcome was the proportion of swabs with normal Nugent score
(<4) after intervention, compared by Fisher's exact test in an intention-to-treat
analysis.
RESULTS: Three hundred twenty pregnant women were enrolled. Vaginal swabs were
analyzed from 290 women before and 271 women after intervention. The proportion
of normal vaginal microbiota decreased from 82.6 to 77.8% in the treatment group 
and from 79.1 to 74.3% in the placebo group, with no significant difference
across groups after intervention (P=.297).
CONCLUSION: Oral probiotics may be suitable for implementation in antenatal care 
but, as administered here, had no effect on vaginal health during mid gestation. 
Other application routes or probiotic preparations may be more effective in
supporting vaginal microbiota during pregnancy.
