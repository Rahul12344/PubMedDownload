This study evaluated the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on
S. mutans using diacetylcurcumin (DAC) and verified DAC toxicity. In vitro, S.
mutans biofilms were exposed to curcumin (CUR) and DAC and were light-irradiated.
Biofilms were collected, plated and incubated for colony counts. DAC and CUR
toxicity assays were conducted with Human Gingival Fibroblast cells (HGF). In
vivo, G. mellonella larvae were injected with S. mutans and treated with DAC, CUR
and aPDT. The hemolymph was plated and incubated for colony counts. Significant
reductions were observed when DAC and CUR alone were used and when aPDT was
applied. HGF assays demonstrated no differences in cell viability for most
groups. DAC and CUR reduced the S. mutans load in G. mellonella larvae both alone
and with aPDT. Systematic toxicity assays on G. mellonella demonstrated no effect
of DAC and CUR or aPDT on the survival curve.
