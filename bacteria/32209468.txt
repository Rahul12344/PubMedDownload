Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is considered a global regulator of
cellular metabolism and innate immune cell functions. Intracellular pathogens
such as Leishmania have been reported to manipulate host cell metabolism. Herein,
we demonstrate that myeloid cells from myeloid-restricted HIF-1α-deficient mice
and individuals with loss-of-function HIF1A gene polymorphisms are more
susceptible to L. donovani infection through increased lipogenesis. Absence of
HIF-1α leads to a defect in BNIP3 expression, resulting in the activation of mTOR
and nuclear translocation of SREBP-1c. We observed the induction of lipogenic
gene transcripts, such as FASN, and lipid accumulation in infected HIF-1α-/-
macrophages. L. donovani-infected HIF-1α-deficient mice develop
hypertriglyceridemia and lipid accumulation in splenic and hepatic myeloid cells.
Most importantly, our data demonstrate that manipulating FASN or SREBP-1c using
pharmacological inhibitors significantly reduced parasite burden. As such,
genetic deficiency of HIF-1α is associated with increased lipid accumulation,
which results in impaired host-protective anti-leishmanial functions of myeloid
cells.
