Conglobatin is an unusual C2-symmetrical macrodiolide from the bacterium
Streptomyces conglobatus with promising antitumor activity. Insights into the
genes and enzymes that govern both the assembly-line production of the
conglobatin polyketide and its dimerization are essential to allow rational
alterations to be made to the conglobatin structure. We have used a rapid, direct
in vitro cloning method to obtain the entire cluster on a 41-kbp fragment,
encoding a modular polyketide synthase assembly line. The cloned cluster directs 
conglobatin biosynthesis in a heterologous host strain. Using a model substrate
to mimic the conglobatin monomer, we also show that the conglobatin
cyclase/thioesterase acts iteratively, ligating two monomers head-to-tail then
re-binding the dimer product and cyclizing it. Incubation of two different
monomers with the cyclase produces hybrid dimers and trimers, providing the first
evidence that conglobatin analogs may in future become accessible through
engineering of the polyketide synthase.
