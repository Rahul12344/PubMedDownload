Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are unique subpopulations of B cells with
immune-regulating or immune-suppressing properties and play a role in peripheral 
tolerance. Due to the current limitations of human Breg studies among periodontal
diseases, in the present study, we tried to analyze the change in circulating
Bregs, pro-inflammatory, and anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients with
periodontitis. Peripheral blood from 55 patients with stage 2 periodontitis and
20 healthy controls was analyzed using flow cytometry to evaluate the frequency
of CD19+CD24+CD38+ Breg cells. ELISA was used to assess the serum levels of the
pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and
anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-β. Increased
proportions of Breg cells were observed in patients with stage 2 periodontitis
compared to controls. Serum levels of cytokines were significantly higher in
patients with periodontitis compared to controls. A significant positive
correlation was observed between the frequencies of Breg cells and IL35 levels,
IL10 levels, and TGF-β. In conclusion, our results suggest that the increase in
peripheral Breg cells and serum cytokine levels among periodontitis patients
seems to be closely associated with disease progression, a possible link between 
periodontitis, and systemic inflammatory process.
