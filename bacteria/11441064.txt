HLA-DM catalyzes the exchange and selection of ligands for MHC class II molecules
within mature endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Here, evidence is provided that
DM edits peptides in early endosomes, thus influencing presentation via recycling
class II molecules. Maximal class II-restricted presentation of an
albumin-derived peptide, dependent on endocytosis and recycling class II
molecules, was observed in cells lacking HLA-DM. DM editing of this epitope was
observed in early endocytic compartments as shown using inhibitors of early to
late endosomal transport. Editing was tempered by coexpression of HLA-DO,
suggesting that DM:DO ratio may be important in guiding epitope editing in early 
endosomal compartments. Thus, HLA-DM appears to interact with, and edit epitopes 
displayed by, recycling class II molecules.
