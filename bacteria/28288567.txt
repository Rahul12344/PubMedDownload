BACKGROUND: Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) is a highly discriminatory typing
strategy; it is reproducible and scalable. There is a MLST scheme for Clostridium
difficile (CD), a gram positive bacillus causing different pathologies of the
gastrointestinal tract. This work was aimed at describing the frequency of
sequence types (STs) and Clades (C) reported and evalute the intra-taxa diversity
in the CD MLST database (CD-MLST-db) using an MLSA approach.
RESULTS: Analysis of 1778 available isolates showed that clade 1 (C1) was the
most frequent worldwide (57.7%), followed by C2 (29.1%). Regarding sequence types
(STs), it was found that ST-1, belonging to C2, was the most frequent. The
isolates analysed came from 17 countries, mostly from the United Kingdom (UK)
(1541 STs, 87.0%). The diversity of the seven housekeeping genes in the MLST
scheme was evaluated, and alleles from the profiles (STs), for identifying CD
population structure. It was found that adk and atpA are conserved genes allowing
a limited amount of clusters to be discriminated; however, different genes such
as drx, glyA and particularly sodA showed high diversity indexes and grouped CD
populations in many clusters, suggesting that these genes' contribution to CD
typing should be revised. It was identified that CD STs reported to date have a
mostly clonal population structure with foreseen events of recombination;
however, one group of STs was not assigned to a clade being highly different
containing at least nine well-supported clusters, suggesting a greater amount of 
clades for CD.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the usefulness of CD-MLST-db as a tool for studying
CD distribution and population structure, identifying the need for reviewing the 
usefulness of sodA as housekeeping gene within the MLST scheme and suggesting the
existence of a greater amount of CD clades. The study also shows the plausible
exchange of genetic material between STs, contributing towards intra-taxa genetic
diversity.
