The c-sea proto-oncogene is a member of the Met/hepatocyte growth factor/scatter 
factor family of receptor protein tyrosine kinases. A distinguishing feature of
this family, whose other member is the Ron/Stk receptor, is a novel heterodimeric
structure. We have previously described cDNA clones encoding the avian Sea
receptor. In this report we show that a full length c-sea cDNA directed the
synthesis of a single 155 kDa polypeptide chain in vitro, while in vivo two
polypeptides of 160 and 180 kDa were observed. We analysed the structure of the
Sea receptor using a soluble chimeric protein consisting of the Sea extracellular
domain linked to the hinge and constant regions of human IgG gamma 1. These
studies indicated that the receptor undergoes proteolytic processing in the
extracellular domain yielding an approximate 35 kDa alpha and a 160 kDa beta
chain, and thus the Sea receptor appears to display a structure similar to that
of the Met and Ron proteins. An examination of embryonic avian tissues using Sea 
extracellular domain-specific monoclonal antibodies revealed low levels of Sea
receptor in a variety of tissues including kidney, intestine, liver, stomach,
white blood cells and allantochorion. Elevated levels of expression were observed
upon transformation of chicken embyro cells by the Src oncoprotein.
