We have analyzed the effect of partially agonistic peptides on the activation and
survival of CTL clones specific for a highly immunogenic HLA A11-restricted
peptide epitope derived from the EBV nuclear Ag-4. Several analogues with
substitutions of TCR contact residues were able to trigger cytotoxic activity
without induction of IL-2 mRNA and protein or T cell proliferation. Triggering
with these partial agonists in the absence of exogenous IL-2 resulted in
down-regulation of the cytotoxic potential of the specific CTLs. One analogue
selectively triggered apoptosis as efficiently as the original epitope,
subdividing the partial agonists into apoptosis-inducing and noninducing ligands.
Analysis of early T cell activation events, induction of Ca2+ influx, and acid
release did not reveal significant differences between the two types of analogue 
peptides. These results demonstrate that some partial agonists can dissociate the
induction of CTL death from CTL activation. Peptides with such properties may
serve as useful tools to study signal transduction pathways in CD8+ lymphocytes
and as therapeutic agents modulating natural immune responses.
