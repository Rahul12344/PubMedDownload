Mal II, a 19-residue peptide derived from the second type 1 properdin-like repeat
of the antiangiogenic protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), was inactive in
angiogenesis assays. Yet the substitution of any one of three L-amino acids by
their D-enantiomers conferred on this peptide a potent antiangiogenic activity
approaching that of the intact 450-kDa TSP-1. Substituted peptides inhibited the 
migration of capillary endothelial cells with an ED50 of 8.5 nM for the D-Ile-15 
substitution, 10 nM for the D-Ser-4 substitution, and 0.75 nM for the D-Ser-5
substitution. A peptide with D-Ile at position 15 could be shortened to its last 
seven amino acids with little loss in activity. Like whole TSP-1, the Mal II
D-Ile derivative inhibited a broad range of angiogenic inducers, was selective
for endothelial cells, and required CD36 receptor binding for activity. A variety
of end modifications further improved peptide potency. An ethylamide-capped
heptapeptide was also active systemically in that when injected i.p. it rendered 
mice unable to mount a corneal angiogenic response, suggesting the potential
usefulness of such peptides as antiangiogenic therapeutics.
