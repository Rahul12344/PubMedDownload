Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent the subpopulation of cancer cells with the
ability to differentiate into other cell phenotypes and initiated tumorigenesis. 
Previously, we reported generating CSCs from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells
(miPSCs). Here, we investigated the ability of the CSCs to differentiate into
hematopoietic cells. First, the primary cells were isolated from malignant tumors
that were formed by the CSCs. Non-adherent cells (NACs) that arose from adherent 
cells were collected and their viability, as well as the morphology and
expression of hematopoietic cell markers, were analyzed. Moreover, NACs were
injected into the tail vein of busulfan conditioned Balb/c nude mice. Finally,
CSCs were induced to differentiate to macrophages while using IL3 and SCF. The
round nucleated NACs were found to be viable, positive for hematopoietic lineage 
markers and CD34, and expressed hematopoietic markers, just like homing to the
bone marrow. When NACs were injected into mice, Wright-Giemsa staining showed
that the number of white blood cells got higher than those in the control mice
after four weeks. CSCs also showed the ability to differentiate toward
macrophages. CSCs were demonstrated to have the potential to provide progenies
with hematopoietic markers, morphology, and homing ability to the bone marrow,
which could give new insight into the tumor microenvironment according to the
plasticity of CSCs.
