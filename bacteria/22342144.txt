Four core structures capable of providing sub-nanomolar inhibitors of anthrax
lethal factor (LF) were evaluated by comparing the potential for toxicity,
physicochemical properties, in vitro ADME profiles, and relative efficacy in a
rat lethal toxin (LT) model of LF intoxication. Poor efficacy in the rat LT model
exhibited by the phenoxyacetic acid series (3) correlated with low rat microsome 
and plasma stability. Specific molecular interactions contributing to the high
affinity of inhibitors with a secondary amine in the C2-side chain were revealed 
by X-ray crystallography.
