Numerous evidences indicated that angiogenesis was a crucial step in the
development of tumor, thus the immunotherapy of antiangiogenesis has been
involved as potentially relevant candidate targets of cancer immunotherapy.
Recently, tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) was discovered to be dominantly
expressed in tumor endothelium, which presented a new strategy to
antiangiogenesis therapy. However, up to date, the related study of TEM8 on
antiangiogenesis is very few. In this study, we constructed a xenogenic DNA
vaccine encoding human TEM8 carried by attenuated Salmonella typhimurium. The
results demonstrated that oral administration of this xenogenic vaccine overcame 
peripheral immune tolerance and generated TEM8-specific CD8 cytotoxic T-cell
response. Moreover, this vaccine effectively protected mice from lethal
challenges against tumor cells, reducing tumor growth, and increasing the mice
life span. In addition, angiogenesis in the tumors was suppressed without obvious
side effect. These results indicated that DNA vaccine encoding xenogenic TEM8
might act as a potential strategy for antiangiogenesis immunotherapy of tumors.
