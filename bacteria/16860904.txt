The antibacterial activities of synthetic human beta-defensin analogs,
constrained by a single disulfide bridge and in the reduced form, have been
investigated. The peptides span the carboxy-terminal region of human
beta-defensins (HBD-1-3), which have a majority of cationic residues present in
the native defensins. The disulfide constrained peptides exhibited activity
against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus whereas the reduced forms were
active only against E. coli. The antibacterial activities were attenuated in the 
presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl and divalent cations such as Ca(2+)
and Mg(2+). The site of action was the bacterial membrane. Peptides spanning the 
carboxy-terminal region of human beta-defensins could be of help in understanding
facets of antimicrobial activity of beta-defensins such as salt sensitivity and
mechanisms of bacterial membrane damage.
