Tenascin C (TNC) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that recently emerged as
an immunomodulator. TNC-deficient (TNC-/-) mice were reported to have a reduced
inflammatory response upon systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide, the
toxic component of gram-negative bacteria. Here, we investigated the role of TNC 
during gram-negative pneumonia derived sepsis. TNC+/+ and TNC-/- mice were
infected with Klebsiella pneumoniae via the airways and sacrificed 24 and 42 h
thereafter for further analysis. Pulmonary TNC protein levels were elevated 42 h 
after infection in TNC+/+ mice and remained undetectable in TNC-/- mice. TNC-/-
mice showed modestly lower bacterial loads in lungs and blood, and a somewhat
reduced local-but not systemic-inflammatory response. Moreover, TNC-/- and TNC+/+
mice did not differ with regard to neutrophil recruitment, lung pathology or
plasma markers of distal organ injury. These results suggest that while TNC
shapes the immune response during lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, this
role may be superseded during pneumosepsis caused by a common gram-negative
pathogen.
