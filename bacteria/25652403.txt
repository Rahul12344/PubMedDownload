Heritable mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 and other genes in the DNA
double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway disrupt binding of the encoded proteins,
transport into the nucleus and initiation of homologous recombination, thereby
increasing cancer risk [Scully, R., Chen, J., Plug, A., Xiao, Y., Weaver, D.,
Feunteun, J., Ashley, T. and Livingston, D.M. (1997) Association of BRCA1 with
Rad51 in mitotic and meiotic cells. Cell, 88, 265-275, Chen, J., Silver, D.P.,
Walpita, D., Cantor, S.B., Gazdar, A.F., Tomlinson, G., Couch, F.J., Weber, B.L.,
Ashley, T., Livingston, D.M. et al. (1998) Stable interaction between the
products of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes in mitotic and meiotic
cells. Mol. Cell, 2, 317-328]. To meet the challenge of correct classification,
flow cytometry-based functional variant analyses (FVAs) were developed to
determine whether variants in DSB repair genes disrupted the binding of BRCA1 to 
BARD1, PALB2, BRCA2 and FANCD2, phosphorylation of p53 or BRCA1 nuclear
localization in response to DNA damage caused by diepoxybutane, mitomycin C and
bleomycin. Lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with BRCA1 pathogenic mutations,
benign variants, and variants of uncertain significance or with known BRCA2,
FANCC or NBN mutations were tested. Mutations in BRCA1 decreased nuclear
localization of BRCA1 in response to individual or combination drug treatment.
Mutations in BRCA1 reduced binding to co-factors, PALB2 and FANCD2 and decreased 
phosphorylation of p53. Mutations in BRCA2, FANCC and NBN decreased nuclear
localization of BRCA1 in response to drug treatment, cofactors binding and p53
phosphorylation. Unsupervised cluster analysis of all and as few as two assays
demonstrated two apparent clusters, high-risk BRCA1 mutations and phenocopies and
low-risk, fully sequenced controls and variants of uncertain significance (VUS). 
Thus, two FVA assays distinguish BRCA1 mutations and phenocopies from benign
variants and categorize most VUS as benign. Mutations in other DSB repair pathway
genes produce molecular phenocopies. FVA assays may represent an adjunct to
sequencing for categorizing VUS or may represent a stand-alone measure for
assessing breast cancer risk.
