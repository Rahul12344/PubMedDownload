The inclusion of organic compounds in freshly emitted sea spray aerosol (SSA) has
been shown to be size-dependent, with an increasing organic fraction in smaller
particles. Here we have used electrospray ionization-high resolution mass
spectrometry in negative ion mode to identify organic compounds in nascent sea
spray collected throughout a 25 day mesocosm experiment. Over 280 organic
compounds from ten major homologous series were tentatively identified, including
saturated (C8-C24) and unsaturated (C12-C22) fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives 
(including saturated oxo-fatty acids (C5-C18) and saturated hydroxy-fatty acids
(C5-C18), organosulfates (C2-C7, C12-C17) and sulfonates (C16-C22). During the
mesocosm, the distributions of molecules within some homologous series responded 
to variations among the levels of phytoplankton and bacteria in the seawater. The
average molecular weight and carbon preference index of saturated fatty acids
significantly decreased within fine SSA during the progression of the mesocosm,
which was not observed in coarse SSA, sea-surface microlayer or in fresh
seawater. This study helps to define the molecular composition of nascent SSA and
biological processes in the ocean relate to SSA composition.
