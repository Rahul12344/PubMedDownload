Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to bacterial infection. The
therapeutic options for treating sepsis are limited. Impaired neutrophil
recruitment into the infection site is directly associated with severe sepsis,
but the precise mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that Mincle plays a key role 
in neutrophil migration and resistance during polymicrobial sepsis.
Mincle-deficient mice exhibited lower survival rates in experimental sepsis from 
cecal ligation and puncture and Escherichia coli-induced peritonitis. Mincle
deficiency led to higher serum inflammatory cytokine levels and reduced bacterial
clearance and neutrophil recruitment. Transcriptome analyses revealed that
trehalose dimycolate, a Mincle ligand, reduced the expression of G
protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in neutrophils. Indeed, GRK2 expression 
was upregulated, but surface expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 was
downregulated in blood neutrophils from Mincle-deficient mice with septic injury.
Moreover, CXCL2-mediated adhesion, chemotactic responses, and F-actin
polymerization were reduced in Mincle-deficient neutrophils. Finally, we found
that fewer Mincle-deficient neutrophils infiltrated from the blood circulation
into the peritoneal fluid in bacterial septic peritonitis compared with wild-type
cells. Thus, our results indicate that Mincle plays an important role in
neutrophil infiltration and suggest that Mincle signaling may provide a
therapeutic target for treating sepsis.
