Lupus nephritis (LN) often results in progressive renal dysfunction. The inactive
rhomboid 2 (iRhom2) is a newly identified key regulator of A disintegrin and
metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), whose substrates, such as TNF-α and heparin-binding 
EGF (HB-EGF), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney
diseases. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of iRhom2 protects the lupus-prone
Fcgr2b-/- mice from developing severe kidney damage without altering
anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) Ab production by simultaneously blocking
HB-EGF/EGFR and TNF-α signaling in the kidney tissues. Unbiased transcriptome
profiling of kidneys and kidney macrophages revealed that TNF-α and HB-EGF/EGFR
signaling pathways are highly upregulated in Fcgr2b-/- mice, alterations that
were diminished in the absence of iRhom2. Pharmacological blockade of either
TNF-α or EGFR signaling protected Fcgr2b-/- mice from severe renal damage.
Finally, kidneys from LN patients showed increased iRhom2 and HB-EGF expression, 
with interstitial HB-EGF expression significantly associated with chronicity
indices. Our data suggest that activation of iRhom2/ADAM17-dependent TNF-α and
EGFR signaling plays a crucial role in mediating irreversible kidney damage in
LN, thereby uncovering a target for selective and simultaneous dual inhibition of
2 major pathological pathways in the effector arm of the disease.
