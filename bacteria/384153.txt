Regulation of the L-arabinose operon in strains of Escherichia coli containing
ColE1-ara hybrid plasmids.

Wallace LJ, Wilcox G.

Hybrid plasmids were constructed from fragments of F'ara episomes formed by the
restriction endonuclease EcoRI and a linear form of the plasmid ColE1 created by 
cleavage with EcoRI. Hybrid plasmids were constructed containing the entire ara
region or the ara region with various parts deleted. E. coli K12 host strains
were constructed which contained different deletions of the ara region. The
hybrid plasmids were transferred to those strains whose ara deletion complemented
that of the plasmid. The initial differential rates of synthesis of L-arabinose
isomerase, the product of the araA gene, were determined for the Ara+, plasmid
containing strains. These studies demonstrated that strains containing
delta(araOIBA)718 produce elevated levels of araC protein, suggesting the araC
promoter has been altered by this deletion. Evidence is also presented which
suggests that araC protein activates the ara-BAD operon to higher levels when it 
is present in cis rather than trans. Amplification of the products of the cloned 
genes is observed when compared to haploid levels in some cases.
