BACKGROUND: The relative nucleated cell count of umbilical cord blood (CB)
correlates with improved engraftment and survival. This study compares two
collection methods to assess CB content, including cell numbers.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Massachusetts CB bank used trained obstetricians
and midwives to collect CB in utero before the delivery of the placenta. The
banks in California, Ohio, Oregon, and Minnesota used trained American Red Cross 
(ARC) personnel who collected CB ex utero after the delivery of the placenta. All
banks processed CB by RBC sedimentation and volume reduction.
RESULTS: The volume and total nucleated cell count of collected CB before
processing, as well as after processing CFU-GM and CD34+ cells, showed no
advantage of either method. In utero collections resulted in more rejections of
collected units (due to labeling problems, bacterial contamination, clotting, and
delay between collection and processing) than ex utero collections. There were
fewer medical exclusions after in utero collection.
CONCLUSION: CB can be collected successfully using either the in utero or ex
utero methods; both methods produce comparable nucleated cell, MNC, CD34+, and
CFU-GM numbers. Bacterial contamination, low volume, clotting, and delay until
processing are generally higher with in utero collection.
