CD4+ T cells require two signals to produce maximal amounts of IL-2, i.e., TCR
occupancy and an unidentified APC-derived costimulus. Here we show that this
costimulatory signal can be delivered by the T cell molecule CD28. An agonistic
anti-CD28 mAb, but not IL-1 and/or IL-6, stimulated T cell proliferation by
tetanus toxoid-specific T cells cultured with Ag-pulsed, costimulation-deficient 
APC. Furthermore, the ability of B cell tumor lines to provide costimulatory
signals to purified T cells correlated well with expression of the CD28 ligand
B7/BB-1. Finally, like anti-CD28 mAb, autologous human APC appeared to stimulate 
a cyclosporine A-resistant pathway of T cell activation. Together, these results 
suggest that the two signals required for IL-2 production by CD4+ T cells can be 
transduced by the TCR and CD28.
