Host-pathogen interactions of Pasteurella multocida isolates of different origin 
were studied in a mouse model, focusing on pathology, bacterial load and
expression of the metalloproteinase MMP9 and its inhibitor TIMP1. Intranasal
inoculation with one of three doses (10(6), 10(4), 10(2)CFU) of an isolate from
porcine pneumonia or fowl cholera showed marked differences between the two
isolates. The avian isolate was highly pathogenic with severe signs of
necrotizing pneumonia, liver necrosis and high bacterial load in lung and liver. 
Clinical signs and pathology related to the porcine isolate were dose dependent
and consisted of exudative bronchopneumonia, abscess formation in liver and a
lower bacterial load in lung and liver. Both isolates caused increased expression
of MMP9 and TIMP1. In conclusion, evaluation and comparison of pathogenicity and 
host-pathogen interaction of P. multocida isolates from different hosts is
possible in the intranasal murine model.
