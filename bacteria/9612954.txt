The hrpC and hrpN operons of Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16 are flanked by plcA and
homologs of hemolysin/adhesin genes and accompanying activator/transporter genes.

The hrpC operon of Erwinia chrysanthemi EC16 encodes five genes conserved in
Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae. Mutagenesis indicated that hrcC is
required for elicitation of the hypersensitive reaction in tobacco leaves. The
unexpected presence of plcA and homologs of hemolysin/activator genes in the
regions flanking the hrcC and hrpN operons is reported.
