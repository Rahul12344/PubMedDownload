Hybrid rotors in F1F(o) ATP synthases: subunit composition, distribution, and
physiological significance.

Brandt K, MÃ¼ller V.

The c ring of the Na+ F1F(o) ATP synthase from the anaerobic acetogenic bacterium
Acetobacterium woodii is encoded by three different genes: atpE1, atpE2 and
atpE3. Subunit c1 is similar to typical V-type c subunits and has four
transmembrane helices with one ion binding site. Subunit c2 and c3 are identical 
at the amino acid level and are typical F-type c subunits with one ion binding
site in two transmembrane helices. All three constitute a hybrid F(o)V(o) c ring,
the first found in nature. To analyze whether other species may have similar
hybrid rotors, we searched every genome sequence publicly available as of 23
February 2015 for F1F(o) ATPase operons that have more than one gene encoding the
c subunit. This revealed no other species that has three different c subunit
encoding genes but twelve species that encode one F(o)- and one V(o)-type c
subunit in one operon. Their c subunits have the conserved binding motif for Na+.
The organisms are all anaerobic. The advantage of hybrid c rings for the
organisms in their environments is discussed.
