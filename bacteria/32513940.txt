Complex polyketides are typically associated with microbial metabolism. Here, we 
report that animals also make complex, microbe-like polyketides. We show there is
a widespread branch of fatty acid synthase- (FAS)-like polyketide synthase (PKS) 
proteins, which sacoglossan animals use to synthesize complex products. The
purified sacogolassan protein EcPKS1 uses only methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate, 
otherwise unknown in animal lipid metabolism. Sacoglossans are sea slugs, some of
which eat algae, digesting the cells but maintaining functional chloroplasts.
Here, we provide evidence that polyketides support this unusual photosynthetic
partnership. The FAS-like PKS family represents an uncharacterized branch of
polyketide and fatty acid metabolism, encoding a large diversity of biomedically 
relevant animal enzymes and chemicals awaiting discovery. The biochemical
characterization of an intact animal polyketide biosynthetic enzyme opens the
door to understanding the immense untapped metabolic potential of metazoans.
