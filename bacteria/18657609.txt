The Escherichia coli adhesin involved in diffuse adherence (AIDA-I) is an outer
membrane autotransporter protein and one of the few glycosylated proteins found
in Escherichia coli. O-glycosylation is mediated by the product of the aah gene, 
which codes for a heptosyltransferase that uses ADP-glycero-manno-heptose
precursors from the LPS biosynthesis pathway. Little else is known about Aah and 
mechanisms involved in modification of AIDA-I. We observed that Aah is mainly
found in an insoluble fraction and, by deletion of the AIDA-I signal sequence or 
by blocking sec-translocation machinery with sodium azide, we showed that
glycosylation occurs in the cytoplasm of bacteria independently of secretion.
Since AIDA-I harbors an N-terminal extension in its signal sequence, we wondered 
whether glycosylation requires this unusual sequence. We observed that, while
deletion of the N-terminal extension affected the expression level of AIDA-I, the
protein was still exported to the outer membrane and glycosylated. Modification
of a secreted protein in the cytoplasm raises several mechanistic questions.
