The effect of pure preparation of ordram, fosalon, DDT, methoxychlorine, hydrel, 
dihydrel, 2,4-D, 2M-4C and of technical preparations of saturn, linuron, ronstar 
and keltan on the membrane functions (respiration and motility) of Azospirillum
brasilense and Chromatium minutissimum cells and on malate and NADH oxidation by 
the isolated membranes of Micrococcus lysodeikticus was investigated. The effect 
varied from irreversible impairment to undetectable impairment of the measured
activities depending on the type of bacteria and on the chemical used. The ordram
induced permeability of the A. brasilense membranes without inhibition of the
respiratory chain activity and selective inhibition of malate oxidase accompanied
by stimulation of NADH oxidation in the M. lysodeikticus membranes indicates a
possibility of ordram application as a regulator of bacterial metabolism.
