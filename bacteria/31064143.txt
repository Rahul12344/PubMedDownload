Polyketides are a large group of secondary metabolites that have notable variety 
in their structure and function. Polyketides exhibit a wide range of
bioactivities such as antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, antiviral,
immune-suppressing, anti-cholesterol, and anti-inflammatory activity. Naturally, 
they are found in bacteria, fungi, plants, protists, insects, mollusks, and
sponges. Streptomyces is a genus of Gram-positive bacteria that has a filamentous
form like fungi. This genus is best known as one of the polyketides producers.
Some examples of polyketides produced by Streptomyces are rapamycin,
oleandomycin, actinorhodin, daunorubicin, and caprazamycin. Biosynthesis of
polyketides involves a group of enzyme activities called polyketide synthases
(PKSs). There are three types of PKSs (type I, type II, and type III) in
Streptomyces responsible for producing polyketides. This paper focuses on the
biosynthesis of polyketides in Streptomyces with three structurally-different
types of PKSs.
