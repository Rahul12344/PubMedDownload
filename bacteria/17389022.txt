We investigated the polymorphism of the transmembrane region of the MICA gene
(major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A) in relation to
susceptibility to human brucellosis. We typed 114 patients with brucellosis and
121 healthy controls for MICA transmembrane polymorphism with polymerase chain
reaction methods combined with fluorescent technology. We found a significant
decrease in the frequency of the MICA-A4 allele in the patients with brucellosis 
compared with the controls (4.4% vs 10.3%, Pc = 0.03). The frequency of the
MICA-A5 allele was increased in the group of patients with focal complications
(15% vs 38%, Pc = 0.004). Our data suggest the MICA-A4 allele shows a tendency to
be protective against infection by Brucella melitensis. Furthermore, the MICA-A5 
allele appears to confer susceptibility to focal forms in patients with
brucellosis.
