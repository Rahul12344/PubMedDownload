The prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis has declined rapidly in Western
Europe during the last century, although a slight increase is being seen due to
immigration from countries where tuberculosis is still a common disease. We
present a very rare case of primary ankle tuberculosis in a 51-year-old native
German male without any risk factors or prior lung manifestation. A delay in
diagnosis and treatment when a patient presents with ankle arthritis caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis should make one aware of the possibility of primary
joint tuberculosis, which is extremely unusual and it can mimic various other
joint diseases. If the diagnosis is in doubt, early biopsy should be mandatory.
