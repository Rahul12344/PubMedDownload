BACKGROUND: Recurrent invasive pneumococcal disease (rIPD) occurs mostly in
children with an underlying disease, but some cases remain unexplained.
Immunodeficiency has been described in children with rIPD, but the prevalence is 
unknown. We used a nationwide registry of all laboratory-confirmed cases of rIPD 
to identify cases of unexplained rIPD and examine them for immunodeficiency.
METHODS: Cases of rIPD in children 0-15 years of age from 1980 to 2008 were
identified. Children without an obvious underlying disease were screened for
complement function, T-cell, B-cell, natural killer--cell counts and
concentration of immunoglobulins. B-cell function was evaluated by measuring
antibody response to polysaccharide-based pneumococcal vaccination and the extent
of fraction of somatic hypermutation. Toll-Like receptor (TLR) signaling function
and mutations in key TLR-signaling molecules were examined.
RESULTS: In total, rIPD were observed in 54 children (68 cases of rIPD of 2192
IPD cases). Children with classical risk factors for IPD were excluded, and among
the remaining 22 children, 15 were eligible for analysis. Of these 6 (40%) were
complement C2-deficient. Impaired vaccination response was found in 6 children of
whom 3 were C2 deficient. One patient had a severe TLR signaling dysfunction. No 
mutations in IRAK4, IKBKG or MYD88 were found.
CONCLUSION: Of an unselected cohort of children with rIPD at least 11% were C2
deficient. Data suggest that screening for complement deficiencies and deficient 
antibody response to pneumococcal vaccines in patients with more than 1 episode
of IPD is warranted.
