We investigated two model systems to study anergy in a human T cell line. OKT3 or
calcium ionophore stimulation of Jurkat cells, in the absence of costimulation,
resulted in a steep reduction in the transcription and secretion of IL-2 in
response to subsequent stimulation via CD3 and CD28. Treatment of anergic Jurkat 
cells with the combination of the phorbol ester, PMA, and ionomycin restored IL-2
production in cells rendered anergic by both mechanisms. However, hydrogen
peroxide, which also stimulates kinases downstream of the proposed block that
occurs in anergic murine cells, did not reverse the anergic state of these cells 
induced by either stimulus. The cause of unresponsiveness in these two models was
found to differ. OKT3-induced anergy resulted in a substantial down-regulation of
the CD3 on these cells. In contrast, anergy induced by treatment with a calcium
ionophore did not result in CD3 down-regulation. These data indicate that the
Jurkat cell line may serve as a suitable model for studying anergy in human T
cells; however, the mechanism by which anergy is induced may vary dramatically in
response to these two commonly used anergy-inducing strategies. Understanding the
similarities and differences between these two models of anergy may lead to a
better overall understanding of the anergic state of the T cell.
