Bone homeostasis requires a delicate balance between the activities of
bone-resorbing osteoclasts and bone-forming osteoblasts. Various molecules
coordinate osteoclast function with that of osteoblasts; however, molecules that 
mediate osteoclast-osteoblast interactions by simultaneous signal transduction in
both cell types have not yet been identified. Here we show that osteoclasts
express the NFATc1 target gene Efnb2 (encoding ephrinB2), while osteoblasts
express the receptor EphB4, along with other ephrin-Eph family members. Using
gain- and loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that reverse signaling
through ephrinB2 into osteoclast precursors suppresses osteoclast differentiation
by inhibiting the osteoclastogenic c-Fos-NFATc1 cascade. In addition, forward
signaling through EphB4 into osteoblasts enhances osteogenic differentiation, and
overexpression of EphB4 in osteoblasts increases bone mass in transgenic mice.
These data demonstrate that ephrin-Eph bidirectional signaling links two major
molecular mechanisms for cell differentiation--one in osteoclasts and the other
in osteoblasts--thereby maintaining bone homeostasis.
