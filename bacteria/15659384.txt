The effect of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) in regulating the synthesis of the
pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in T lymphocytes is not yet
defined, even though it may reduce or enhance IL-8 synthesis in other cell types.
Here, we demonstrate that, in human T cells, PGE(2) induced IL-8 mRNA
transcription through prostaglandin E(2) receptors 1- and 4-dependent signal
transduction pathways leading to the activation of the transcription factor C/EBP
homologous protein (CHOP), never before implicated in IL-8 transcription. Several
kinases, including protein kinase C, Src family tyrosine kinases,
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and p38 MAPK, were involved in PGE(2)-induced CHOP
activation and IL-8 production. The transactivation of the IL-8 promoter by CHOP 
was NF-kappaB-independent. Our data suggest that PGE(2) acts as a potent
pro-inflammatory mediator by inducing IL-8 gene transcription in activated T
cells through different signal transduction pathways leading to CHOP activation. 
These findings show the complexity with which PGE(2) regulates IL-8 synthesis by 
inhibiting or enhancing its production depending on the cell types and
environmental conditions.
