Stromal cells (SCs) establish the compartmentalization of lymphoid tissues
critical to the immune response. However, the full diversity of lymph node (LN)
SCs remains undefined. Using droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing, we
identified nine peripheral LN non-endothelial SC clusters. Included are the
established subsets, Ccl19hi T-zone reticular cells (TRCs), marginal reticular
cells, follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and perivascular cells. We also
identified Ccl19lo TRCs, likely including cholesterol-25-hydroxylase+ cells
located at the T-zone perimeter, Cxcl9+ TRCs in the T-zone and interfollicular
region, CD34+ SCs in the capsule and medullary vessel adventitia, indolethylamine
N-methyltransferase+ SCs in the medullary cords, and Nr4a1+ SCs in several
niches. These data help define how transcriptionally distinct LN SCs support
niche-restricted immune functions and provide evidence that many SCs are in an
activated state.
