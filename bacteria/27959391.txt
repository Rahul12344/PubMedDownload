Tuberculosis (TB) is an important infectious disease of humans and other animals.
Conventional diagnostic methods, including the tuberculin skin test, chest X‑rays
and bacterial culture, have certain innate disadvantages for the early, rapid and
specific diagnosis of tuberculosis. The present study aimed to identify a novel
diagnostic biomarker to overcome these disadvantages. The potential target
identified in the present study was tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1
(TIMP‑1), which has previously been demonstrated to be critical in the immune
response to TB. The concentration of TIMP‑1 in the blood was determined using a
commercial ELISA kit, and the relative mRNA expression levels following bacterial
infection were detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain
reaction. Based on a clinical and microbiological diagnosis, the ELISA for plasma
TIMP‑1 had a sensitivity of 91.80% [95% confidence interval (CI): 85.44, 96.00]
and a specificity of 91.41% (95% CI: 85.14, 95.63). In a THP‑1 cell model,
Bacillus Calmette‑Guérin and Mycobacterium bovis significantly upregulated the
mRNA expression levels of TIMP‑1 post infection in a time‑dependent manner
(P=0.006 for BCG 24 h PI, P=3.2x10‑7 for M. bovis 24 PI). The results of the
present study indicate that plasma TIMP‑1 may be a potential biomarker for the
diagnosis of TB.
