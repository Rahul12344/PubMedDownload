A novel TnMERI1-like transposon designated as TnMARS1 was identified from mercury
resistant Bacilli isolated from Minamata Bay sediment. Two adjacent ars
operon-like gene clusters, ars1 and ars2, flanked by a pair of 78-bp inverted
repeat sequences, which resulted in a 13.8-kbp transposon-like fragment, were
found to be sandwiched between two transposable genes of the TnMERI1-like
transposon of a mercury resistant bacterium, Bacillus sp. MB24. The presence of a
single transcription start site in each cluster determined by 5'-RACE suggested
that both are operons. Quantitative real time RT-PCR showed that the
transcription of the arsR genes contained in each operon was induced by arsenite,
while arsR2 responded to arsenite more sensitively and strikingly than arsR1 did.
Further, arsenic resistance complementary experiments showed that the ars2 operon
conferred arsenate and arsenite resistance to an arsB-knocked out Bacillus host, 
while the ars1 operon only raised arsenite resistance slightly. This transposon
nested in TnMARS1 was designated as TnARS1. Multi-gene cluster blast against
bacteria and Bacilli whole genome sequence databases suggested that TnMARS1 is
the first case of a TnMERI1-like transposon combined with an arsenic resistance
transposon. The findings of this study suggested that TnMERI1-like transposons
could recruit other mobile elements into its genetic structure, and subsequently 
cause horizontal dissemination of both mercury and arsenic resistances among
Bacilli in Minamata Bay.
