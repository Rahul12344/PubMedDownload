T cell anergy is characterized by alterations in TCR signaling that may play a
role in controlling the unresponsiveness of the anergic cell. We have addressed
questions regarding the importance of the Src kinase p59(fyn) (Fyn) in this
process by using Fyn null mice. We demonstrate that a mature population of
CD4(-)CD8(-) alphabeta TCR(+) anergic T cells lacking Fyn have a substantial
recovery of their proliferation defect in response to Ag stimulation. This
recovery cannot be explained by ameliorated production of IL-2, and the improved 
proliferation correlates with an enhanced ability of the Fyn(-/-) anergic T cells
to up-regulate the high affinity IL-2 receptor. We also observe that anergic
CD4(-)CD8(-) alphabeta TCR(+) T cells have a heightened survival ability that is 
partially dependent on the elevated levels of Fyn and IL-2 receptor beta-chain
expressed by these cells. The enhanced survival correlates with an increased
capacity of the anergic cells to respond to IL-15. We conclude that Fyn plays an 
important role in aspects of T cell anergy pertaining to TCR signaling and to
cell survival.
