BACKGROUND/AIMS: MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule that
functions in regulation of gene expression by targeting mRNA to affect its
stability and/or translation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the miRNAs
involvement in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a well known risk factor for 
fetal overgrowth.
METHODS: Differential microRNA expression in placental tissues of normal controls
and women with GDM were identified by miRNA micorarray analysis and further
confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on an independent set of normal
and GDM placental tissues. Target genes of microRNAs were bioinformatically
predicted and verified in vitro by Western blotting.
RESULTS: Our results uncovered 9 miRNAs that were significantly deregulated in
GDM samples: miR-508-3p was up-regulated and miR-27a, miR-9, miR-137, miR-92a,
miR-33a, miR-30d, miR-362-5p and miR-502-5p were down-regulated. Bioinformatic
approaches revealed that the microRNAs signature identifies gene targets involved
in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor)-PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-Kinase)-Akt
(also known as protein kinase B) pathway, a signal cascade which plays important 
roles in placental development and fetal growth. We found that the protein levels
of EGFR, PI3K and phospho-Akt were up-regulated and PIKfyve (a FYVE
finger-containing phosphoinositide kinase), a negative regulator of EGFR
signaling, was down-regulated significantly in GDM tissues. We also confirmed
PIKfyve was a direct target of miR-508-3p.
CONCLUSION: Our data identified a miRNA signature involvement in GDM which may
contribute to macrosomia through enhancing EGFR signaling.
