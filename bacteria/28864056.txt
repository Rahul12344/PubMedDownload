BACKGROUND: Host responses during sepsis are highly heterogeneous, which hampers 
the identification of patients at high risk of mortality and their selection for 
targeted therapies. In this study, we aimed to identify biologically relevant
molecular endotypes in patients with sepsis.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study that included
consecutive patients admitted for sepsis to two intensive care units (ICUs) in
the Netherlands between Jan 1, 2011, and July 20, 2012 (discovery and first
validation cohorts) and patients admitted with sepsis due to community-acquired
pneumonia to 29 ICUs in the UK (second validation cohort). We generated
genome-wide blood gene expression profiles from admission samples and analysed
them by unsupervised consensus clustering and machine learning. The primary
objective of this study was to establish endotypes for patients with sepsis, and 
assess the association of these endotypes with clinical traits and survival
outcomes. We also established candidate biomarkers for the endotypes to allow
identification of patient endotypes in clinical practice.
FINDINGS: The discovery cohort had 306 patients, the first validation cohort had 
216, and the second validation cohort had 265 patients. Four molecular endotypes 
for sepsis, designated Mars1-4, were identified in the discovery cohort, and were
associated with 28-day mortality (log-rank p=0·022). In the discovery cohort, the
worst outcome was found for patients classified as having a Mars1 endotype, and
at 28 days, 35 (39%) of 90 people with a Mars1 endotype had died (hazard ratio
[HR] vs all other endotypes 1·86 [95% CI 1·21-2·86]; p=0·0045), compared with 23 
(22%) of 105 people with a Mars2 endotype (HR 0·64 [0·40-1·04]; p=0·061), 16
(23%) of 71 people with a Mars3 endotype (HR 0·71 [0·41-1·22]; p=0·19), and 13
(33%) of 40 patients with a Mars4 endotype (HR 1·13 [0·63-2·04]; p=0·69).
Analysis of the net reclassification improvement using a combined clinical and
endotype model significantly improved risk prediction to 0·33 (0·09-0·58;
p=0·008). A 140-gene expression signature reliably stratified patients with
sepsis to the four endotypes in both the first and second validation cohorts.
Only Mars1 was consistently significantly associated with 28-day mortality across
the cohorts. To facilitate possible clinical use, a biomarker was derived for
each endotype; BPGM and TAP2 reliably identified patients with a Mars1 endotype.
INTERPRETATION: This study provides a method for the molecular classification of 
patients with sepsis to four different endotypes upon ICU admission. Detection of
sepsis endotypes might assist in providing personalised patient management and in
selection for trials.
