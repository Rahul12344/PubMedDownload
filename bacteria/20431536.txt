Genetic and diet-induced rodent obesity models provide outstanding opportunities 
to study the role of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in modulation of
adipogenesis and obesity. In this study, we describe methods to quantitatively
study adipose angiogenesis and vascular remodeling on the basis of
immunohistochemical analyses. Fresh white adipose tissue or brown adipose tissue 
are prepared for whole mount, cryosectioned and paraffin-embedded samples,
followed by staining with specific markers such as platelet endothelial cell
adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1)/CD31, CD34, isolectin B4 or alpha-smooth muscle
actin. Adipocytes are visualized by staining lipid droplets with
4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid (BODIPY) 558/568
C(12). This protocol may take 2-5 d to obtain results. In the view of the crucial
roles of vasculature in modulation of adipogenesis and obesity, this protocol is 
valuable for studying the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in obese adipose
tissues and for assessing the anti-obesity activity of angiogenesis modulators.
