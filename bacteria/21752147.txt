In vitro secretion profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and 
of human beta-defensins (HBD)-1, HBD-2, and HBD-3 from human chorioamniotic
membranes after selective stimulation with Gardnerella vaginalis.

PROBLEM: Preterm labor associated with infection is a major clinical condition;
in this work, we analyze the response of human chorioamniotic membranes
stimulated with Gardnerella vaginalis.
METHOD OF STUDY: Using a two-compartment experimental model, 1 × 10(6) CFU/mL of 
G. vaginalis were added to either the amnion or choriodecidua face or to both.
Concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, as well as human beta defensins (HBD)
1-3 were quantified by ELISA.
RESULTS: In comparison with control conditions and regardless of the stimulation 
modality, IL-1β and IL-6 increased 4-fold and 28-fold, respectively, in the
choriodecidual compartment. HBD-1 increased 2-fold mainly in the amniotic
compartment when the stimulus was applied directly to this region. HBD-2 and
HBD-3 increased an average of 2- and 8-fold, respectively, in the choriodecidual 
region.
CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation with G. vaginalis induced a tissue-specific secretion
profile of 1L-1β, IL-6, and HBD 1-3 in the chorioamniotic membranes.
