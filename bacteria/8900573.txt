Arsenic compounds, often present as environmental pollutants, are highly toxic
for most microorganisms. Some microbial strains possess genetic determinants
conferring resistance to arsenic derivatives. In bacteria, these determinants are
usually located on plasmids, which has facilitated their analysis with molecular 
detail. Bacterial plasmids conferring arsenic resistance encode specific pumps
that extrude arsenite (AsIII). In Gram-negative bacteria, the efflux pump
consists of a complex formed by an ATPase (ArsA) associated with a membrane anion
channel (ArsB). Arsenate (AsV) is converted to arsenite by a soluble reductase
(ArsC). Proteins ArsB and ArsC, but not the ATPase, are also found in
Gram-positive bacteria. Besides the widely spread plasmid arsenic resistance
determinants, some bacteria possess the ability to enzimatically oxidize arsenite
to less toxic arsenate.
