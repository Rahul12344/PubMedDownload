Halococcus salifodinae BIpT DSM 8989T, an extremely halophilic archaeal isolate
from an Austrian salt deposit (Bad Ischl), whose origin was dated to the Permian 
period, was described in 1994. Subsequently, several strains of the species have 
been isolated, some from similar but geographically separated salt deposits. Hcc.
salifodinae may be regarded as one of the most ancient culturable species which
existed already about 250 million years ago. Since its habitat probably did not
change during this long period, its properties were presumably not subjected to
the needs of mutational adaptation. Hcc. salifodinae and other isolates from
ancient deposits would be suitable candidates for testing hypotheses on
prokaryotic evolution, such as the molecular clock concept, or the net-like
history of genome evolution. A comparison of available taxonomic characteristics 
from strains of Hcc. salifodinae and other Halococcus species, most of them
originating from surface waters, is presented. The cell wall polymer of Hcc.
salifodinae was examined and found to be a heteropolysaccharide, similar to that 
of Hcc. morrhuae. Polyhydroxyalkanoate granules were present in Hcc. salifodinae,
suggesting a possible lateral gene transfer before Permian times.
