Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen in
pneumonia, associated with severe lung damage. Tissue injury causes release of
Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), which may perpetuate inflammation. 
DNA has been implicated as a DAMP that activates inflammation through Toll-like
receptor (TLR)9. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of TLR9 in MRSA
pneumonia. Wild-type (Wt) and TLR9 knockout (tlr9-/-) mice were infected
intranasally with MRSA USA300 (BK 11540) (5E7CFU) and euthanized at 6,24,48 or 72
hours for analyses. MRSA pneumonia was associated with profound release of
cell-free host DNA in the airways, as reflected by increases in nucleosome and
DNA levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), accompanied by transient
detection of pathogen DNA in MRSA-free BALF supernatants. In BALF, as compared to
Wt -mice tlr9-/- mice showed reduced TNFÎ± and IL-6 levels at 6 hours and reduced 
bacterial clearance at 6 and 24 hours post infection. Furthermore, tlr9-/- mice
exhibited a greater influx of neutrophils in BALF and increased lung
consolidation at 24 and 48 hours. This study demonstrates the release of host-
and pathogen-derived TLR9 ligands (DNA) into the alveolar space after infection
with MRSA via the airways and suggests that TLR9 has pro-inflammatory effects
during MRSA pneumonia associated with enhanced bacterial clearance and limitation
of lung consolidation.
