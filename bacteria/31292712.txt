Dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi via animals and the importance for the interacting
partners' life history as well as for ecosystems is an understudied topic. In
this review, we describe the available evidence and the most important knowledge 
gaps and finally suggest ways to gain the missing information. So far, 33
articles have been published proving a successful transfer of mycorrhizal
propagules by animals. The vast majority of research on invertebrates was focused
on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, whereas papers on vertebrates (mainly
rodents and artiodactyls) equally addressed ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and AM fungi.
Effective dispersal has been mostly shown by the successful inoculation of bait
plants and less commonly by spore staining or germination tests. Based on the
available data and general knowledge on animal lifestyles, collembolans and
oribatid mites may be important in transporting ECM fungal propagules by
ectozoochory, whereas earthworms, isopods, and millipedes could mainly transfer
AM fungal spores in their gut systems. ECM fungal distribution may be affected by
mycophagous dipterans and their hymenopteran parasitoids, while slugs, snails,
and beetles could transport both mycorrhizal groups. Vertebrates feeding on fruit
bodies were shown to disperse mainly ECM fungi, while AM fungi are transported
mostly accidentally by herbivores. The important knowledge gaps include
insufficient information on dispersal of fungal propagules other than spores, the
role of invertebrates in the dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi, the way in which
propagules pass through food webs, and the spatial distances reached by different
dispersal mechanisms both horizontally and vertically.
