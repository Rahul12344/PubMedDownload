Up-Regulated Gene 7 (URG7) is a host gene up-regulated in HBV infected
hepatocytes that has been suggested to have an anti-apoptotic activity mediated
by caspases 3 and 8 and an endoplasmic reticulum localization. Here we report the
structural characterization of the encoded protein URG7 by circular dichroism and
fluorescence spectroscopy in different solvent media: phosphate buffer and two
membrane-mimetic solvents, i.e. 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) and SDS micelles. In
all solvents URG7 contains substantial amounts of secondary structures. To obtain
information about the structural organization and stability of URG7, its thermal 
denaturation in a membrane environment was studied and intermediate states of
thermal unfolding were observed. Furthermore, fluorescence results in SDS
micelles could be compatible with different environments for the four tryptophan 
residues in URG7. Preliminary NMR data indicate that URG7 in TFE solution is
quite flexible and not well folded. These data are the first structural
information on URG7 and might provide an insight into its structure-function
relationships.
