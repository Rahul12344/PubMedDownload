Klebsiella pneumoniae is among the most common Gram-negative bacteria that cause 
pneumonia. Gp96 is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone that is essential for the
trafficking and function of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and integrins. To
determine the role of gp96 in myeloid cells in host defence during Klebsiella
pneumonia, mice homozygous for the conditional Hsp90b1 allele encoding gp96 were 
crossed with mice expressing Cre-recombinase under control of the LysM promoter
to generate LysMcre-Hsp90b1-flox mice. LysMcre-Hsp90b1-flox mice showed absence
of gp96 protein in macrophages and partial depletion in monocytes and
granulocytes. This was accompanied by almost complete absence of TLR2 and TLR4 on
macrophages. Likewise, integrin subunits CD11b and CD18 were not detectable on
macrophages, while being only slightly reduced on monocytes and granulocytes.
Gp96-deficient macrophages did not release pro-inflammatory cytokines in response
to Klebsiella and displayed reduced phagocytic capacity independent of CD18.
LysMcre-Hsp90b1-flox mice were highly vulnerable to lower airway infection
induced by K. pneumoniae, as reflected by enhanced bacterial growth and a higher 
mortality rate. The early inflammatory response in Hsp90b1-flox mice was
characterized by strongly impaired recruitment of granulocytes into the lungs,
accompanied by attenuated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the
inflammatory response during late-stage pneumonia was not dependent on the
presence of gp96. Blocking CD18 did not reproduce the impaired host defence of
LysMcre-Hsp90b1-flox mice during Klebsiella pneumonia. These data indicate that
macrophage gp96 is essential for protective immunity during Gram-negative
pneumonia by regulating TLR expression.
