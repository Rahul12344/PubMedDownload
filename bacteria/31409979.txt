Objectives: To answer to the following questions: is there any relationship
between oral hygiene and the growth of yeast in patients without mucosal
inflammation; and is there a need for mycological examination patients without
mucosal inflammation?
Background: Patients with candidiasis may report varied symptoms, but such
infections are most often asymptomatic. In addition to its high incidence in
denture users (60%-100%), there is a concern that Candida species from the oral
cavity may colonize the upper gastrointestinal tract and lead to septicemia,
which has a 40%-79% mortality rate and can require a prolonged hospital stay. It 
is thus important for all physicians to be aware of the risk factors, diagnosis, 
and treatment of oral candidiasis in older patients.
Methods: A retrospective study was carried out on a group of patients who had
undergone mycological examination and assessment of the intensity of yeast
growth, and oral hygiene.
Results: Ninety-one denture wearers who lacked signs of clinical inflammation
were included in the study. The growth of Candida albicans was as follows: 14
patients had up to 20 colonies; 19 patients had over 20 colonies. Ten percent of 
patients with good oral hygiene proved to have more than 20 yeast colonies. 5% of
patients with bad oral hygiene had more than 20 colonies.
Conclusions: There was no relationship found between hygiene and the growth rate 
of fungal microorganisms. In patients without clinical symptoms of stomatitis,
mycological examination should be considered.
