Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important animal and zoonotic disease, which
causes severe economic losses. The main focus of this study was to assess the
predictive power of previously identified biomarkers of bTB in infected animals
that were negative to the tuberculin skin test (TST). We studied 16 animals with 
bTB, in which the disease was confirmed by necropsy, and 16 healthy animals. The 
level of expression of ten biomarkers (CXCL9, THBS1, MMP9, IL-22, CXCL10, IFNγ,
IL-17, FYVE, CD14, IL-1R) was evaluated by RT-qPCR upon stimulation or not of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells with PPDb (purified protein derivative of
bovine tuberculin). In this assay, CXCL9, THBS1, MMP9, IL-22 and IFNγ changed
their expression level depending on the bTB status. In addition, we evaluated
different biomarker candidates simultaneously to infer the animal condition. By
performing an analysis with classification trees, we found that the sturdiest
combination was IL-22, IFNγ and IL-1R. On the other hand, CXCL10, IFNγ and
IL-22's expression distinguished between bTB positive animals that were negative 
to TST (TST false negative animals) and the bTB negative groups. Thus, these
biomarkers are promising candidates to be tested as an ancillary diagnostic
assay. In addition, the expression of CXCL10 and IL-22 exhibited also significant
differences between the bTB positive animals that were undetectable by IFNγ
release assay (IGRA) and TST tests (TST and IGRA false negative animals) and the 
bTB negative groups. Therefore, CXCL10 and IL-22 constitute candidate biomarkers 
that could complement the two most widely used diagnostic tests.
