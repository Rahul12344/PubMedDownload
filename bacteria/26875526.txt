Crucial to Natural Killer T (NKT) cell function is the interaction between their 
T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD1d-antigen complex. However, the diversity of the NKT
cell repertoire and the ensuing interactions with CD1d-antigen remain unclear. We
describe an atypical population of CD1d-α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)-reactive 
human NKT cells that differ markedly from the prototypical
TRAV10-TRAJ18-TRBV25-1(+) type I NKT cell repertoire. These cells express a range
of TCR α- and β-chains that show differential recognition of glycolipid antigens.
Two atypical NKT TCRs (TRAV21-TRAJ8-TRBV7-8 and TRAV12-3-TRAJ27-TRBV6-5) bind
orthogonally over the A'-pocket of CD1d, adopting distinct docking modes that
contrast with the docking mode of all type I NKT TCR-CD1d-antigen complexes.
Moreover, the interactions with α-GalCer differ between the type I and these
atypical NKT TCRs. Accordingly, diverse NKT TCR repertoire usage manifests in
varied docking strategies and specificities towards CD1d-α-GalCer and related
antigens, thus providing far greater scope for diverse glycolipid antigen
recognition.
