Pathogenic Yersinia species can evade phagocytosis by injecting virulence
effectors that interfere with the phagocytic machinery of host cells. One of
these virulence effectors is the protein tyrosine phosphatase YopH. Through its
enzymatic activity, YopH interferes with the initial phagocytic process by
affecting signalling for cytoskeletal rearrangements. Fyb (Fyn-binding protein), 
which is an immune cell-specific adaptor protein, has been identified as a
substrate of YopH in macrophages. In this study, the interaction between YopH and
Fyb is studied. We show that YopH binds to Fyb via different regions in both
phosphotyrosine-dependent and phosphotyrosine-independent ways. The
phosphotyrosine substrate binding N-terminal part (1-130) of YopH as well as the 
C-terminal catalytic region binds to Fyb in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner.
We also show that a central part of YopH (130-260) interacts with the Fyb
C-terminus (548-783) in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner. Further, we
demonstrate that the N-terminal binding region of YopH is important for
YopH-mediated functions on macrophages such as dephosphorylation of Fyb, blockage
of phagocytosis, and cytotoxic effects.
