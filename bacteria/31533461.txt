Cyclin E and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) have been observed as a multifaceted 
factor in many cancers, and the assessment of microvascular density (MVD) and
micro-lymphatic vessel density (MLVD) has been used to quantify tumor
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the
association between expression of cyclin E, HGF, MVD, and MLVD, and
clinicopathologic parameters in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The
expression of cyclin E, HGF, MVD, and MLVD were detected using
immunohistochemically anticyclin E, HGF, CD34, and lymphatic vessel endothelial
hyaluronan receptor 1 in 168 surgically resected ESCC cases and 30 normal
esophageal mucosal samples. The expression levels of cyclin E, HGF, MVD, and MLVD
were higher compared to controls. High cyclin E and HGF expression was found more
frequently in the tumors larger than 5 cm (P < .001), with poorer differentiation
(P = .034) and higher tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging (P = .009) compared to 
their counterparts. Both MVD and MLVD values were found to be higher in the
tumors larger than 5 cm (P < .001), with poorer differentiation (P < .001) and
higher TNM staging (P < .001) compared to their counterparts. Furthermore, the
expression of MVD and MLVD in both the high cyclin E and high HGF expression
groups was significantly higher compared to the low cyclin E and HGF expression
groups (P < .001). This study demonstrated that high cyclin E and HGF expression 
is closely correlated with tumor size, tumor differentiation degree, and TNM
stage in patients with ESCC. These findings proposed that cyclin E and HGF could 
serve as novel molecular markers for preoperational evaluation of ESCC.
