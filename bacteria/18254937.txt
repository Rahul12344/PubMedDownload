The receptor of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor
that upon activation causes sustained activation of multiple inflammatory
pathways. Recent evidence, summarized in a review by Bopp and colleagues in this 
issue of Critical Care, has implicated RAGE as a potential therapeutic target in 
sepsis. Here, we discuss several open issues that need to be addressed before
anti-RAGE strategies can enter the sepsis clinical trial arena.
