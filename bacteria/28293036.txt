Seventeen new compounds, naphthacemycins A1-A11, B1-B4 and C1-C2, were isolated
from a cultured broth of Streptomyces sp. KB-3346-5 during screening for
circumventors of β-lactam resistance in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic studies, including NMR 
and X-ray crystallographic analysis. The naphthacemycin A series has a new
skeleton displaying a 7-phenylnaphthacene-5,6,11(12H)-trione. In contrast, the
quinone moiety of the A series is changed to dehydroxyquinol in the B series and 
to a semiquinone-like structure in the C series.
