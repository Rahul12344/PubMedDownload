Metatranscriptomics has been developed to help understand how communities respond
to changes in their environment. Metagenomic studies provided a snapshot of the
genetic composition of the community at any given time. However, short-timescale 
studies investigating the response of communities to rapid environmental changes 
(e.g. pollution events or diurnal light availability) require analysis of changes
in the abundance and composition of the active fraction of the community.
Metatranscriptomics enables researchers to investigate the actively transcribed
ribosomal and messenger RNA from a community. It has been applied to environments
as diverse as soil and seawater. This chapter outlines sampling protocols and RNA
extraction techniques from these two ecosystems, as well as details a method to
enrich mRNA in the extracted nucleic acid. Also, a section is dedicated for
outlining a bioinformatic procedure for the analysis of metatranscriptomic
datasets.
