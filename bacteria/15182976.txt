Phytoremediation of creosote-contaminated soil was monitored in the presence of
Tall fescue, Kentucky blue grass, or Wild rye. For all three grass species, plant
growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were evaluated for plant growth promotion
and protection of plants from contaminant toxicity. A number of parameters were
monitored including plant tissue water content, root growth, plant chlorophyll
content and the chlorophyll a/b ratio. The observed physiological data indicate
that some plants mitigated the toxic effects of contaminants. In addition, in
agreement with our previous experiments reported in the accompanying paper
(Huang, X.-D., El-Alawi, Y., Penrose, D.M., Glick, B.R., Greenberg, B.M., 2004. A
multi-process phytoremediation system for removal of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons from contaminated soil. Environ. Poll. doi:
10.1016/j.envpol.2003.09.031), PGPR were able to greatly enhance
phytoremediation. PGPR accelerated plant growth, especially roots, in heavily
contaminated soils, diminishing the toxic effects of contaminants to plants.
Thus, the increased root biomass in PGPR-treated plants led to more effective
remediation.
