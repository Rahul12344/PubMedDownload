In mice, two restricted dendritic cell (DC) progenitors, macrophage/dendritic
progenitors (MDPs) and common dendritic progenitors (CDPs), demonstrate
increasing commitment to the DC lineage, as they sequentially lose granulocyte
and monocyte potential, respectively. Identifying these progenitors has enabled
us to understand the role of DCs and monocytes in immunity and tolerance in mice.
In humans, however, restricted monocyte and DC progenitors remain unknown.
Progress in studying human DC development has been hampered by lack of an in
vitro culture system that recapitulates in vivo DC hematopoiesis. Here we report 
a culture system that supports development of CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cell
progenitors into the three major human DC subsets, monocytes, granulocytes, and
NK and B cells. Using this culture system, we defined the pathway for human DC
development and revealed the sequential origin of human DCs from increasingly
restricted progenitors: a human granulocyte-monocyte-DC progenitor (hGMDP) that
develops into a human monocyte-dendritic progenitor (hMDP), which in turn
develops into monocytes, and a human CDP (hCDP) that is restricted to produce the
three major DC subsets. The phenotype of the DC progenitors partially overlaps
with granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs). These progenitors reside in human
cord blood and bone marrow but not in the blood or lymphoid tissues.
