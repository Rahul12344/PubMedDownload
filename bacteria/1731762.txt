It has been shown previously that the thioredoxin system (thioredoxin +
thioredoxin reductase + NADPH) may replace dithiothreitol (DTT) as a cofactor for
vitamin KO and K reductase in salt-washed detergent-solubilized bovine liver
microsomes. Here we demonstrate that the system can be improved further by adding
protein disulphide-isomerase (PDI) to the components mentioned above. Moreover,
NADPH may be replaced by reduced RNAase as a hydrogen donor. In our in vitro
system the various protein cofactors were required at concentrations 2-5 orders
of magnitude lower than that of DDT, whereas the maximal reaction rate was about 
3-fold higher. PDI stimulated the thioredoxin-driven reaction about 10-fold, with
an apparent Km value of 8 microM. These data suggest that in the vitro system the
formation of disulphide bonds is somehow linked to the vitamin K-dependent
carboxylation of glutamate residues. In vivo, both disulphide formation and
vitamin K-dependent carboxylation are post-translational modifications taking
place at the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum of mammalian secretory
cells. The possibility that the reactions are also coupled in vivo is discussed.
