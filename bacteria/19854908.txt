Attachment of microorganisms to surfaces is a prerequisite for colonization and
biofilm formation. The hyperthermophilic crenarchaeote Sulfolobus solfataricus
was able to attach to a variety of surfaces, such as glass, mica, pyrite, and
carbon-coated gold grids. Deletion mutant analysis showed that for initial
attachment the presence of flagella and pili is essential. Attached cells
produced extracellular polysaccharides containing mannose, galactose, and
N-acetylglucosamine. Genes possibly involved in the production of the
extracellular polysaccharides were identified.
