Catabolism of L-rhamnose in A. nidulans proceeds via the non-phosphorylated
pathway and is glucose repressed by a CreA-independent mechanism.

L-rhamnose (6-deoxy-mannose) occurs in nature mainly as a component of certain
plant structural polysaccharides and bioactive metabolites but has also been
found in some microorganisms and animals. The release of L-rhamnose from these
substrates is catalysed by extracellular enzymes including α-L-rhamnosidases, the
production of which is induced in its presence. The free sugar enters cells via
specific uptake systems where it can be metabolized. Of two L-rhamnose catabolic 
pathways currently known in microorganisms a non-phosphorylated pathway has been 
identified in fungi and some bacteria but little is known of the regulatory
mechanisms governing it in fungi. In this study two genes (lraA and lraB) are
predicted to be involved in the catabolism of L-rhamnose, along with lraC, in the
filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Transcription of all three is
co-regulated with that of the genes encoding α-L-rhamnosidases, i.e. induction
mediated by the L-rhamnose-responsive transcription factor RhaR and repression of
induction in the presence of glucose via a CreA-independent mechanism. The
participation of lraA/AN4186 (encoding L-rhamnose dehydrogenase) in L-rhamnose
catabolism was revealed by the phenotypes of knock-out mutants and their
complemented strains. lraA deletion negatively affects both growth on L-rhamnose 
and the synthesis of α-L-rhamnosidases, indicating not only the indispensability 
of this pathway for L-rhamnose utilization but also that a metabolite derived
from this sugar is the true physiological inducer.
