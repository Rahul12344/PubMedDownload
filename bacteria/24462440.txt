A 12-year-old Japanese girl developed infective endocarditis and central nervous 
system disease. The previously healthy girl showed altered consciousness and
abnormal behaviors along with the classical signs of septic emboli.
Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from peripheral blood, but not, the
pleocytotic cerebrospinal fluid. Diagnostic imaging studies revealed a vegetative
structure in the morphologically normal heart, and multiple thromboembolisms in
the brain and spleen. Low plasma activity of protein S (12%) and thrombophilic
family history allowed the genetic study, demonstrating that she carried a
heterozygous mutation of PROS1 (exon 13; 1689C > T, p.R474C). Surgical
intervention of the thrombotic fibrous organization and subsequent anticoagulant 
therapy successfully managed the disease. There are no reports of infective
endocarditis in childhood occurring as the first presentation of heritable
thrombophilia. Protein S deficiency might be a risk factor for the development or
exacerbation of infective endocarditis in children having no pre-existing heart
disease.
