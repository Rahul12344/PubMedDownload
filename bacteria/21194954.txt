Compounds inhibiting LpxC in the lipid A biosynthetic pathway are promising leads
for novel antibiotics against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. We
report the syntheses and structural and biochemical characterizations of LpxC
inhibitors based on a diphenyl-diacetylene (1,4-diphenyl-1,3-butadiyne)
threonyl-hydroxamate scaffold. These studies provide a molecular interpretation
for the differential antibiotic activities of compounds with a substituted distal
phenyl ring as well as the absolute stereochemical requirement at the C2, but not
C3, position of the threonyl group.
