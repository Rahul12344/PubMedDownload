A yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig from the C57BL/6 (H2(b)) mouse was
created from the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc, H2 in mouse) class Ib
subregion, H2-M. It spans approximately 1.2 megabase (Mb) pairs and unites the
previous >1.5-Mb YAC contigs (Jones et al. 1995) into a single contig, which
includes 21 Mhc class I genes distal to H2-T1. A bacterial artificial chromosome 
(BAC) contig from the 129 (H2(bc)) mouse, spanning approximately 600 kilobases,
was also built from Znf173 (Afp, a gene for acid finger protein), through Tctex5 
(t-complex testis expressed-5) and Mog (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein), to 
H2-M2. Twenty-four sequence-tagged site (STS) markers were newly developed, and
35 markers were mapped in the YAC/BAC contigs, which define the marker order as
Cen - Znf173 - Tctex5 - Mog - D17Tu42 - D17Mit232 - H2-M3 - D17Leh525 - H2-M2 -
Tel. The gene order of Znf173 - Tctex5 - Mog - D17Tu42 is conserved between mouse
and human, showing that the middle H2-M region corresponds to the subregion of
the human Mhc surrounding HLA-A.
