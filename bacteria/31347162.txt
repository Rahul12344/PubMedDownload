BACKGROUND: During inflammation, stressed or infected cells can release adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) to the extracellular medium, which can be hydrolyzed to
adenosine by ectonucleotidases such as ectonucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase 1 (CD39) and 5'-nucleotidase (CD73). The role of CD73 in the
modulation of cytokine release by human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) remains
underexplored. Here, we investigated whether CD73-mediated hydrolysis of
extracellular ATP (eATP) could affect interleukin (IL)-1β-induced CXCL8
secretion.
METHODS: The levels of mRNA expression of adenosine receptors, CD39 and CD73 of
periodontitis samples were retrieved from a public database. Moreover, HGF mRNA
levels were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-qPCR) after 3, 6, or 24 hours of IL-1β stimulation. IL-1β-induced
CXCL8 protein levels were measured after pretreatment with 100-µM eATP in the
presence or absence of CD73 inhibitor. The effect of eATP degradation to
adenosine on CXCL8 levels was investigated using agonist and antagonist of
adenosine receptors.
RESULTS: Levels of CD39, CD73, and adenosine receptor mRNA were differentially
modulated by IL-1β. ATP pretreatment impaired IL-1β-induced CXCL8 secretion and
required activation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and phosphorylated adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase (pAMPK). The inhibition of CD73 or the
inhibition of adenosine receptors abrogated the ATP effect on CXCL8 secretion.
CONCLUSIONS: CD73-generated adenosine dampens IL-1β-induced CXCL8 in HGFs and
involves HO-1 and pAMPK signaling. These results imply that CD73 is a negative
regulator of the inflammatory microenvironment, suggesting that this ectoenzyme
could be involved in the generation of deficient CXCL8 gradient in chronic
inflammation.
