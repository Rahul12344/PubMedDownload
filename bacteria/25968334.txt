The presence of lymph node (LN)-like vasculature in tumours, characterized by
expression of peripheral node addressin and chemokine CCL21, is correlated with
T-cell infiltration and positive prognosis in breast cancer and melanoma
patients. However, mechanisms controlling the development of LN-like vasculature 
and how it might contribute to a beneficial outcome for cancer patients are
unknown. Here we demonstrate that LN-like vasculature is present in murine models
of melanoma and lung carcinoma. It enables infiltration by naive T cells that
significantly delay tumour outgrowth after intratumoral activation. Development
of this vasculature is controlled by a mechanism involving effector CD8 T cells
and NK cells that secrete LTα3 and IFNγ. LN-like vasculature is also associated
with organized aggregates of B lymphocytes and gp38(+) fibroblasts, which
resemble tertiary lymphoid organs that develop in models of chronic inflammation.
These results establish LN-like vasculature as both a consequence of and key
contributor to anti-tumour immunity.
