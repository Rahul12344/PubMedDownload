A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the colonization of
alfalfa roots by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus etunicatum and
application of the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 on DDT uptake by alfalfa and
depletion in soil. Mycorrhizal colonization led to an increase in the
accumulation of DDT in roots but a decrease in shoots. The combination of AM
inoculation and Triton X-100 application enhanced DDT uptake by both the roots
and shoots. Application of Triton X-100 gave much lower residual concentrations
of DDT in the bulk soil than in the rhizosphere soil or in the bulk soil without 
Triton X-100. AM colonization significantly increased bacterial and fungal counts
and dehydrogenase activity in the rhizosphere soil. The combined AM inoculation
of plants and soil application of surfactant may have potential as a
biotechnological approach for the decontamination of soil polluted with DDT.
