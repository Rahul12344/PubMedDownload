The cytokine/chemokine expression signature of a 60-year-old African American
male with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) was analyzed using
patient blood samples obtained from two separate visits to the clinic. Thirty-six
different cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were detected in the plasma
of the RRMS patient using a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay. Results indicated
that at least ten of these factors with a concentration of > 100 pg/mL are
identified as pro-inflammatory. Calpain inhibition led to an anti-inflammatory
effect, as indicated by a decrease in expression of pro-inflammatory
cytokines/chemokines such as GM-CSF, IFNγ, and IL-17A, and a relative increase in
two of the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-13 and IL-4) in the peripheral blood
mononuclear cells activated with anti-CD3/CD28. Overall, these results suggest
that the unique cytokine/chemokine pattern observed in the plasma of the RRMS
patient can be used as a prognostic marker and calpain inhibition may be used as 
a novel therapeutic strategy for treating excessive inflammatory response
specific to RRMS patients.
