OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether secretion of human β-defensin 2 (HBD-2) is
induced by bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and to determine whether HBD-2 affects 
BCG internalisation in bladder cancer cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis
was used to determine whether HBD-2 mRNA increases after incubation with BCG.
HBD-2 proteins in 5637 and T24 human bladder cancer cell lines were assayed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The internalisation rate was evaluated by
double immunofluorescence assay and confocal microscopy to test the optimal dose 
of HBD-2 for BCG internalisation. We also investigated the difference in
internalisation rates and cell viability between recombinant HBD-2 protein,
anti-HBD-2 antibody, and HBD-2 plus anti-HBD-2 antibody pretreatments.
RESULTS: BCG induced HBD-2 mRNA expression and HBD-2 production dose and
time-dependently in bladder cancer cells and affected BCG internalisation.
Pretreatment with recombinant HBD-2 protein lowered internalisation of BCG
dose-dependently. Moreover, anti-HBD-2 antibody prevented the effect of HBD-2 on 
BCG internalisation in bladder cancer cells. The internalisation rate of BCG
pretreated with anti-HBD-2 antibody was higher than that in the control in 5637
(P < 0.01) and T24 cells (P < 0.05). The BCG internalisation rate in cells
pretreated with anti-HBD-2 antibody plus recombinant HBD-2 protein was higher
than that in the control in 5637 (P < 0.01) and T24 cells (P < 0.05).
Mycobacterium bovis BCG decreased bladder cancer cell viability, and anti-HBD-2
antibody prevented the inhibitory role of HBD-2 on the anti-proliferative effects
of M. bovis BCG in bladder cancer cells
CONCLUSION: Bladder cancer cells produce HBD-2 when they are infected by BCG to
defend themselves against BCG internalisation, which plays an important role
during the initiation and propagation of the immunotherapeutic response in
bladder cancer cells.
