During the spring of 1996 and autumn of 1997 unusual mortality outbreaks among
rainbow trout fry and yearlings occurred at two different trout farms, resulting 
in mortality of 20 and 10 per cent, respectively. Generally, the affected fish,
swimming at the water surface, were reluctant to eat and were dark pigmented with
visible haemorrhages around and within the oral cavity. Bacterial isolates from
moribund fish from both cases were identified as Yersinia ruckeri by standard
biochemical tests and API 20E. The isolated strains were found to be sensitive to
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, nalidixic acid, flumequine,
enrofloxacin, carbenicillin and gentamicin. Microplate agglutination assay
confirmed that both isolates belonged to serotype O1. The pathogenicity of the
isolated bacteria was confirmed by challenge experiment. Titres of specific
antibodies were determined in the sera of survivors. The titre was highest on the
21st day postchallenge and was detectable until the 81st day.
