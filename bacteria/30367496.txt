BACKGROUND: In Argentina, peanuts are stored for 3-6 months. It is important to
avoid proliferation of fungi and insect pests during this period. In this study, 
the potential of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) microcapsules to conserve peanut 
kernels was evaluated in microcosms and on a pilot scale.
RESULTS: In microcosm assays, microcapsules containing BHA at a dose of
1802 µg g-1 reduced 37% of total fungal count. Higher reductions (77-100%) were
obtained with a combined treatment with BHA formulation (1802 µg g-1 )
plus fungicide (methyl thiophanate 0.0100 g L-1  and metalaxyl 0.0133 g L-1 ).
However, germination levels of peanut seeds treated with the BHA formulation were
less than 6% throughout the incubation time. In pilot-scale trials, the storage
conditions allowed the control of fungal development and insect proliferation.
Quantifiable levels of BHA were also detected throughout the entire storage
period. The combined treatment significantly reduced fungal contamination at
2 months of storage (C1-2015: 37.41%; C1-2016: 28.48%; C2-2016: 45.02%). Seed
germination of unshelled stored peanuts was not affected by the formulation.
CONCLUSION: The application of the BHA formulation during storage combined with
pre-seeding treatment could be an appropriate strategy to maintain the quality of
the peanut kernels destined for seed. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.
