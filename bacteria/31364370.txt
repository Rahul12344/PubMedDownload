Pulmonary hypertension complicates the care of many patients with chronic lung
diseases (defined as Group 3 pulmonary hypertension), yet the mechanisms that
mediate the development of pulmonary vascular disease are not clearly defined.
Despite being the most prevalent form of pulmonary hypertension, to date there is
no approved treatment for patients with disease. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) and endothelial cells in the lung express the chemokine receptor CXCR2,
implicated in the evolution of both neoplastic and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
However, precise cellular contribution to lung disease is unknown. Therefore, we 
used mice with tissue-specific deletion of CXCR2 to investigate the role of this 
receptor in Group 3 pulmonary hypertension. Deletion of CXCR2 in myeloid cells
attenuated the recruitment of polymorphonuclear MDSCs to the lungs, inhibited
vascular remodeling, and protected against pulmonary hypertension. Conversely,
loss of CXCR2 in endothelial cells resulted in worsened vascular remodeling,
associated with increased MDSC migratory capacity attributable to increased
ligand availability, consistent with analyzed patient sample data. Taken
together, these data suggest that CXCR2 regulates MDSC activation, informing
potential therapeutic application of MDSC-targeted treatments.
