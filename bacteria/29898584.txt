BACKGROUND: Studies analyzing risk factors of weaning failure in neurological and
neurosurgical early rehabilitation (NNER) patients are rare.
AIM: The aim of this study was to identify clinical factors influencing the
weaning of NNER patients.
DESIGN: An observational, retrospective data analysis of a German multicenter
study was performed.
SETTING: German neurological early rehabilitation centers.
POPULATION: Inpatient ventilated NNER patients (N.=192) were enrolled in the
study.
METHODS: Demographical data, main diagnosis, medical devices, special medical
care and assessment instruments of functional abilities, consciousness and
independence in activities of daily living were accrued and compared between
patients with and without successful weaning. The prognostic power of factors
associated with weaning success/failure was analyzed using binary logistic
regression.
RESULTS: In total, 75% of the patients were successfully weaned. Colonization
with multi-drug resistant bacteria and the need for dialysis were independent
predictors of weaning failure. Successfully weaned patients had a shorter length 
of stay, better functional outcome, and lower mortality than non-successfully
weaned patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Successfully weaned patients differ from patients with weaning
failure in several clinical variables. All these variables are associated with
the morbidity of the patient, indicating that the weaning process is strongly
influenced by disease burden.
CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Functional abilities, level of consciousness,
independence in activities of daily living, colonization with multi-drug
resistant bacteria, need for dialysis and disease duration might help to predict 
the weaning process of NNER.
