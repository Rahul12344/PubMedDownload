Diet and the gut microbiota may underpin numerous human diseases. A major
metabolic product of commensal bacteria are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that 
derive from fermentation of dietary fibre. Here we show that diets deficient or
low in fibre exacerbate colitis development, while very high intake of dietary
fibre or the SCFA acetate protects against colitis. SCFAs binding to the
'metabolite-sensing' receptors GPR43 and GPR109A in non-haematopoietic cells
mediate these protective effects. The inflammasome pathway has hitherto been
reported as a principal pathway promoting gut epithelial integrity. SCFAs binding
to GPR43 on colonic epithelial cells stimulates K(+) efflux and
hyperpolarization, which lead to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Dietary fibre
also shapes gut bacterial ecology, resulting in bacterial species that are more
effective for inflammasome activation. SCFAs and metabolite receptors thus
explain health benefits of dietary fibre, and how metabolite signals feed through
to a major pathway for gut homeostasis.
