Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a pluripotent growth factor
that exerts mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic effects. To elucidate the
cellular mechanisms underlying the pluripotent function of this growth factor,
T47D human breast cancer cells were transfected with human hgf/sf. The
hgf/sf-positive clones exhibited different levels of biologically functional
HGF/SF expression and up-regulation of endogenous Met (HGF/SF receptor)
expression. In addition, a constitutive phosphorylation of the receptor on
tyrosine residues was detected, establishing a Met-HGF/SF autocrine loop. The
autocrine activation of Met caused marked inhibition in cell growth accompanied
by cell accumulation at G0/G1. These cells underwent terminal cell
differentiation as determined by morphological changes, synthesis of milk
proteins such as beta-casein and alpha-lactalbumin, and production of lipid
vesicles. Our results demonstrate that Met-HGF/SF, an oncogenic signal
transduction pathway, is capable of inducing growth arrest and differentiation in
certain breast cancer cells and, thus, may have potential as therapeutic and/or
prognostic tools in breast cancer treatment.
