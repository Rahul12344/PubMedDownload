Polysaccharides could be used as biodegradable and biocompatible polymers for
scaffolds and carriers matrix. Numerous algal, fungi and herbal polysaccharides
can attenuate degradation of skin matrix by the inhibition of elastase,
collagenase and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In this study, we investigate
anti-elastase and anti-collagenase potential of Lactobacilli exopolysaccharides
(LEPS) on normal human fibroblast. Among 60 Lactobacilli isolated from herbal
plants and dairy products, selected LEPS showed high anti-collagenase (up to
100%), anti-elastase (up to 87%) and antioxidant activity (up to 60%). Most of
them had no cytotoxicity effect on fibroblast, and some of them promote cell
proliferation (up to 10%). In scratch assay, all the investigated EPSs stimulated
wound healing process in fibroblast (up to 99%). MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP10
were down-regulated significantly and TIMP1 and TIMP2 were up-regulated slightly 
in LEPS of B9-1 from L. casei with high anti-collagenase and anti-elastase
activity; however, no meaningful alteration was observed in MMPs expression level
for LEPS of P35 from L. plantarum with low anti-collagenase and anti-elastase
activity. By consideration of high anti-collagenase, anti-elastase, antioxidant
activity and wound healing of LEPS, they could be considered as good candidate of
skin anti-aging agents for tissue engineering and skin regeneration scaffolds.
