BACKGROUND: Patients with atopic eczema (AE) regularly experience colonization
with Staphylococcus aureus that is directly correlated with the severity of
eczema. Recent studies show that an impaired IL-17 immune response results in
diseases associated with chronic skin infections.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to elucidate the effect of IL-17 on antimicrobial immune
responses in AE skin.
METHODS: T cells infiltrating atopy patch test (APT) reactions were characterized
for IL-17 secretion to varying stimuli. IL-17-dependent induction of the
antimicrobial peptide human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in keratinocytes was
investigated.
RESULTS: Approximately 10% of APT-infiltrating T cells secreted IL-17 after
phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin stimulation. Among these, 33%
belonged to the newly characterized subtype T(H)2/IL-17. Despite the capacity to 
secrete IL-17, specific T-cell clones released only low amounts of IL-17 on
cognate allergen stimulation, whereas IL-4, IFN-gamma, or both were efficiently
induced. IL-17 secretion was not enhanced by IL-23, IL-1 beta, or IL-6 but was
enhanced by the S aureus-derived superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B. Both 
healthy and AE keratinocytes upregulated HBD-2 in response to IL-17, but
coexpressed IL-4/IL-13 partially inhibited this effect. In vivo, additional
application of staphylococcal enterotoxin B induced IL-17 in APT reactions,
whereas IL-4, IFN-gamma, and IL-10 were marginally regulated. Induced IL-17
upregulated HBD-2 in human keratinocytes in vivo.
CONCLUSION: IL-17-capable T cells, in particular T(H)2/IL-17 cells, infiltrate
acute AE reactions. Although IL-17 secretion by specific T cells is tightly
regulated, it can be triggered by bacteria-derived superantigens. The ineffective
IL-17-dependent upregulation of HBD-2 in patients with AE is due to a partial
inhibition by the type 2 microenvironment, which could partially explain why
patients with AE do not clear S aureus.
