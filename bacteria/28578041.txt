Human gut flora-mediated non-digestible fraction of spent coffee grounds
(hgf-NDSCG) was evaluated for its chemopreventive effect and molecular mechanisms
involved on human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cell survival using two different
microbiota source [lean (L) and overweight (OW)]. The source of human gut flora
(hgf) (L or OW) affected the pH of hgf-NDSCG only minimally, but linearly reduced
those of hgf-inulin. The variability between lean and overweight microbiota was
characterized by the metabolism and/or bioaccessibility of different phenolic
metabolites, their intermediate and end products as well as by variable time
courses. Apoptosis of colon cancer HT-29 cells depended on the microbiota source 
with the lean microbiota expressing a low lethal concentration 50
(LC50/L-hgf-NDSCG=13.5%). We demonstrate that NDSCG and its colonic metabolite
from lean microbiota induced HT-29 cell apoptosis by reducing catalase and
8-iso-prostaglandin F2α as biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress as the primary 
mechanism underlying its overall chemoprotection against colon cancer.
