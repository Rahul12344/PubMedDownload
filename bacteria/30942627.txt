The objective of this study was to assess the antibacterial activity of
Rifampicin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles on Brucella abortus 544.
Rifampicin-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles were prepared by a modified
microemulsion/sonication method and characterized. The results showed the average
size about 319.7 nm, PI about 0.20 and zeta potential about 18.4 mv,
encapsulation efficacy and drug-loading were equal to 95.78 and 34.2%,
respectively, with a spherical shape. Drug release lasted for 5 days. The
antibacterial activity was statistically significant with p < .05 in bacterial
and cell culture media compared to free Rifampicin. It can be concluded that
solid lipid nanoparticles can be considered as a promising delivery system for
improving the antibacterial activity of Rifampicin against Brucella abortus.
