Hydrostatic pressure and ionic strength effects on the kinetics of lysozyme.

Neville WM, Eyring H.

The kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by egg-white lysozyme from hen eggs (EC
3.2.1.17) was investigated by measurement of the decrease in turbidity of
suspensions of dried Micrococcus luteus cells. The substrate and NaCl
concentration were varied, as well as the hydrostatic pressure (1-476 atm). A
plot of the initial velocity against the reciprocal of the substrate
concentration gave straight lines. From these plots values for the maximum
velocity, V, and the apparent Michaelis constant, K(m), as well as the effect of 
NaCl concentration were determined. The maximum velocity showed a pronounced
maximum when plotted over a range of NaCl concentration from 0-0.208 M. The
volume change of activation, DeltaV([unk]), calculated from V, was negative, and 
decreased in absolute value from -8 to about 0 cm(3)/mol as the NaCl molarity was
increased over the above range. This effect is explained as due to a different
number of salt molecules being built into activated complexes with each of these 
activated complexes reacting at its own characteristic rate. Strong
pressure-dependence of enzyme catalysis indicates appreciable conformational
changes of the enzyme as it is incorporated into the activated complex. The
volume change causing the pressure effect arises principally from changes in the 
number of ionized species with the accompanying electrostriction.
