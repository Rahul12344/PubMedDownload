Developing thymocytes migrate from the cortex to the medulla of the thymus as a
consequence of positive selection. This migration is likely to be essential for
tolerance because it allows the developing cells to move into an environment that
is optimal for negative selection. Guidance mechanisms that draw positively
selected thymocytes into the medulla have not been clarified, but several studies
have implicated chemokines in the process. CCR7, the receptor for the medullary
chemokines CCL19 and CCL21, is induced on thymocytes during their positive
selection. In this study we show that premature expression of CCR7 repositions
CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive cells into the medulla of transgenic mice. This
repositioning of the thymocytes is accompanied by impairment of their
development. The data show the involvement of CCR7 in medullary migration and
emphasize the importance of proper thymocyte positioning for efficient T cell
development.
