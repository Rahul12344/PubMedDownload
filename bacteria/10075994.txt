Major histocompatibility complex class II genes contain a common complex enhancer
that allows for their coordinate regulation. The X box element of the enhancer
cooperatively binds the multisubunit transcription factors RFX and X2BP. RFX is
an essential class II transcription factor and contains three distinct proteins: 
RFX5, RFX-B/Ank and RFXAP. X2BP, a CREB/ATF family transcription factor, most
likely binds as a homodimer. A site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking assay 
was used to investigate the interactions of the subunits of RFX and X2BP with X
box DNA. Two of the RFX subunits, RFX5 and RFX-B/Ank, were found to bind defined 
sites within the X1 half of the X box. The third RFX subunit, RFXAP, made
extensive X1 box contacts. The subunits of X2BP made contacts with the edges of
the X2 half of the X box in a manner consistent with other bZIP transcription
factor contact patterns. The resulting map provides specific base pair contacts
and subunit orientation with respect to the DNA sequence of the RFX-X2BP-X box
complex. Our results suggest possible stoichiometry of the RFX subunits and
potential interaction between RFX-B/Ank and RFXAP with one of the subunits of
X2BP.
