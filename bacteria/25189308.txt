INTRODUCTION: Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) is a distinct clinical and
biological subtype of acute myeloid leukaemia. APL is notorious for causing early
death during induction therapy, resulting in induction failure. The aim of our
study was to report the clinical characteristics, outcome and early induction
deaths with regard to patients with APL seen at our hospital.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study carried out at Aga Khan University
Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. Patients aged > 15 years diagnosed with APL within
the period September 2007-September 2012 were included in the study.
RESULTS: Within the study period, 26 patients were diagnosed with APL based on
morphology and the detection of t(15;17)(q24.1;q21.1) and promyelocytic
leukaemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA). The male to female ratio was
1:1. The median age of the patients was 41 (range 16-72) years. In all, there
were 13 (50.0%) high-risk patients, and early induction death rate was 61.5%.
Causes of early induction deaths (n = 16) included haemorrhage in 7 (43.8%)
patients, differentiation (ATRA) syndrome in 7 (43.8%) and infection in 2
(12.5%). The survival rate among patients who survived the early period was 70%
at 42 months. The relapse rate was 30%.
CONCLUSION: Early induction death rate was very high in patients with APL. The
most common cause of early induction death in our study was haemorrhage. Outcome 
among patients with APL was found to be better among those who survived the
initial period.
