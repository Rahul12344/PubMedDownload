Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), produced as by-products of dietary fiber
metabolism by gut bacteria, have anti-inflammatory properties and could
potentially be used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including asthma.
The direct effects of SCFAs on inflammatory responses in primary human lung
mesenchymal cells have not been assessed. We investigated whether SCFAs can
protect against tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-induced inflammation in primary
human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells in vitro. HLFs
and ASM cells were exposed to SCFAs, acetate (C2:0), propionate (C3:0), and
butyrate (C4:0) (0.01-25 mM) with or without TNFα, and the release of
proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, and CXCL8 was measured using ELISA. We found
that none of the SCFAs suppressed TNFα-induced cytokine release. On the contrary,
challenge with supraphysiological concentrations (10-25 mM), as might be used
therapeutically, of propionate or butyrate in combination with TNFα resulted in
substantially greater IL-6 and CXCL8 release from HLFs and ASM cells than
challenge with TNFα alone, demonstrating synergistic effects. In ASM cells,
challenge with acetate also enhanced TNFα-induced IL-6, but not CXCL8 release.
Synergistic upregulation of IL-6 and CXCL8 was mediated through the activation of
free fatty acid receptor (FFAR)3, but not FFAR2. The signaling pathways involved 
were further examined using specific inhibitors and immunoblotting, and responses
were found to be mediated through p38 MAPK signaling. This study demonstrates
that proinflammatory, rather than anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs are evident 
in lung mesenchymal cells.
