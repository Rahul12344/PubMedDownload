RATIONALE: Preclinical studies suggest that hospitalized patients are susceptible
to infections caused by nosocomial respiratory pathogens at least in part because
of immune suppression caused by the condition for which they were admitted.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize the systemic host response in
hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) when compared with community-acquired pneumonia
(CAP).
METHODS: We performed a prospective study in two intensive care units (ICUs) in
453 patients with HAP (n = 222) or CAP (n = 231). Immune responses were
determined on ICU admission by measuring 19 plasma biomarkers reflecting organ
systems implicated in infection pathogenesis (in 192 patients with HAP and 183
patients with CAP) and by applying genome-wide blood gene expression profiling
(in 111 patients with HAP and 110 patients with CAP).
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with HAP and CAP presented with similar
disease severities and mortality rates did not differ up to 1 year after
admission. Plasma proteome analysis revealed largely similar responses, including
systemic inflammatory and cytokine responses, and activation of coagulation and
the vascular endothelium. The blood leukocyte genomic response was greater than
75% common in patients with HAP and CAP, comprising proinflammatory,
antiinflammatory, T-cell signaling, and metabolic pathway gene sets. Patients
with HAP showed overexpression of genes involved in cell-cell junction
remodeling, adhesion, and diapedesis, which corresponded with lower plasma levels
of matrix metalloproteinase-8 and soluble E-selectin. In addition, patients with 
HAP demonstrated underexpression of a type-I interferon signaling gene signature.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HAP and CAP present with a largely similar host
response at ICU admission.
