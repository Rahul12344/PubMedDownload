The transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) mediates the
metabolic adaptation of cells to hypoxia and T-helper cell fate. However, HIF-1α 
regulation in CD4(+) T cells (T cells) remains elusive. Here we observed that
depletion of oxygen (O2⩽2%) alone was not sufficient to induce HIF-1α expression 
in T cells. However, when hypoxic T cells were stimulated, HIF-1α was expressed
and this was dependent on nuclear factor-κB- and nuclear factor of activated T
cell (NFAT)-mediated transcriptional upregulation of Hif-1α mRNA. HIF-1α
upregulation could be blocked by drugs inhibiting NF-κB, NFAT or mammalian target
of rapamycin precluding CD4(+) T-cell stimulation or translation in T cells, as
well as by blocking transcription. CD3, CD28, phorbol-12-myristat-13-acetat (PMA)
or ionomycin-stimulated T cells did not express HIF-1α under normoxic conditions.
In conclusion, regulation of HIF-1α expression in CD4(+) T cells in hypoxia
gravely relies on its transcriptional upregulation and subsequent enhanced
protein stabilization.
