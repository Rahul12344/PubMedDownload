Ustilago maydis is a biotrophic fungus causing corn smut disease in maize. The
secreted effector protein Pit2 is an inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases 
(PLCPs) essential for virulence. Pit2 inhibitory function relies on a conserved
14 amino acids motif (PID14). Here we show that synthetic PID14 peptides act more
efficiently as PLCP inhibitors than the full-length Pit2 effector. Mass
spectrometry shows processing of Pit2 by maize PLCPs, which releases an
inhibitory core motif from the PID14 sequence. Mutational analysis demonstrates
that two conserved residues are essential for Pit2 function. We propose that the 
Pit2 effector functions as a substrate mimicking molecule: Pit2 is a suitable
substrate for apoplastic PLCPs and its processing releases the embedded inhibitor
peptide, which in turn blocks PLCPs to modulate host immunity. Remarkably, the
PID14 core motif is present in several plant associated fungi and bacteria,
indicating the existence of a conserved microbial inhibitor of proteases (cMIP).
