There has been much interest recently in the antimicrobial properties of cationic
peptides called beta-defensins from epithelial cells. Human beta-defensin (hBD)-1
and -2 have been particularly implicated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where 
their inhibition by high salt concentrations may explain in part the
susceptibility of the CF lung to bacterial infection. In this work, we have
employed a simple co-culture system using the 16-HBE human bronchial epithelial
cell line to assess growth inhibitory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Burkholderia cepacia. In medium alone, P. aeruginosa proliferated more than
100,000-fold, whereas in the presence of 16-HBE cells or 16-HBE-conditioned
medium, bacterial proliferation was less than 100-fold. Raising the salt
concentration of cell-free 16-HBE conditioned medium to approximately 200 mM
significantly reduced this growth inhibitory activity. In contrast, there was no 
evidence of epithelial-derived growth inhibitory activity against two strains of 
B. cepacia. RT-PCR analysis indicated expression of the hBD-2 mRNA in 16-HBE
cells, but not hBD-1. These data demonstrate for the first time that B. cepacia
is resistant to epithelial-derived antimicrobial substances and argue against
them being important in the defense against this organism in the lung.
