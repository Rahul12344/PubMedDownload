The functional heterogeneity of T cell responses to diverse antigens expressed at
different stages of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, in particular
early secreted versus dormancy related latency antigens expressed later, that
distinguish subjects with latent (LTBI), pulmonary (PTB) or extrapulmonary (EPTB)
tuberculosis remains unclear. Here we show blood central memory CD4 T-cell
responses specific to Mtb dormancy related (DosR) latency, but not classical
immunodominant secretory antigens, to clearly differentiate LTBI from EPTB and
PTB. The polyfunctionality score integrating up to 31 DosR-specific CD4 T-cell
functional profiles was significantly higher in LTBI than EPTB or PTB subjects.
Further analysis of 256 DosR-specific T-cell functional profiles identified
regulatory IL10 + Th17 cells (IL10+IL17A+IL17F+IL22+) to be significantly
enriched in LTBI; in contrast to pro-inflammatory Th17 cells (IFNγ+IL17A+/IL10-) 
in the blood and lung of EPTB and PTB subjects respectively. A blood
polyfunctional, Mtb DosR latency antigen specific, regulatory, central memory
response is therefore a novel functional component of T-cell immunity in latent
TB and potential correlate of protection.
