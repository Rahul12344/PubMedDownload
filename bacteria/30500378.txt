Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are macromolecular glyco-conjugates
expressed ubiquitously on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix where 
they interact with a wide range of ligands to regulate many aspects of cellular
function. The capacity of the side glycosaminoglycan chain heparan sulfate (HS)
being able to interact with diverse protein ligands relies on its complex
structure that is generated by a controlled biosynthesis process, involving the
actions of glycosyl-transferases, sulfotransferases and the glucuronyl
C5-epimerase. It is believed that activities of the modification enzymes control 
the HS structures that are designed to serve the biological functions in a given 
cell or biological status. In this review, we briefly discuss recent
understandings on the roles of HSPG in cytokine stimulated cellular signaling,
focusing on FGF, TGF-β, Wnt, Hh, HGF and VEGF.
