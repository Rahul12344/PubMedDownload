The co-production of MCR and carbapenemase in Enterobacteriaceae has been
previously reported. Here, we describe a clinical strain of Escherichia coli from
Vietnam carrying both mcr-1 and bla NDM-1. Whole-genome sequencing showed that
the genome of this strain consists of a 4,975,832-bp chromosome and four
plasmids. The mcr-1 and bla NDM-1 genes are located on IncI2 and IncA/C2-type
plasmids, respectively. Genetic analysis revealed the presence of a
multidrug-resistant region with the structure of a novel complex class 1 integron
including a class 1 integron region bearing two 5' conserved segments and one 3' 
conserved segment and two complete structures of ISCR1. The complex integron
contains aminoglycoside resistance genes aadA2, aadB, strA, strB, and aphA6,
quinolone resistance gene qnrA1, extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene bla OXA- 4,
and a Tn125-like transposon bearing bla NDM-1. In addition, the
dfrA12-gcuF-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1-qacH gene cassette array belonging to the sul3-type
integron was also identified, but the region found downstream of the gene
cassette array is the IS440-tet(M)-IS26 element instead of the sul3 gene. The
results further support that Enterobacteriaceae isolates co-harboring mcr and bla
NDM are widely being distributed. The structural characteristics of the complex
integron reveal that ISCR1 elements play an important role in the mobilization of
bla NDM-1 and the development of multidrug-resistant regions.
