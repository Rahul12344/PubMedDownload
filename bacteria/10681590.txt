Translocation of the SOS and Vav GDP/GTP exchange factors proximal to Ras and Rac
GTPases localized in the plasma membrane glycolipid-enriched microdomains is a
pivotal step required for T cell antigen receptor-induced T cell activation. Here
we demonstrate that the T cell antigen receptor zeta-chain-associated ZAP-70
kinase and T cell antigen receptor zeta-chain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
activation motifs are essential for the membrane recruitment of SOS and Vav.
Plasma membrane targeting of SOS or Vav begins with the assembly of ZAP-70 with
Grb-2 and SOS. The subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT (linker for
activation of T cell) by ZAP-70 leads to a shift in equilibrium from the
ZAP-70.Grb-2.SOS(Vav) complex to the (Vav)SOS.Grb-2.LAT complex. This shift
results in the targeting of SOS and Vav into glycolipid-enriched microdomains and
initiation of the Ras and Rac signaling cascades involved in T cell activation,
proliferation, and cytokine production.
