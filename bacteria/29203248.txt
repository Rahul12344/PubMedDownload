In eukaryotes, a cytosolic ribosome quality control complex recycles erroneously 
stalled ribosomes and modifies faulty nascent chains by ubiquitination and by
C-terminal Ala- and Thr-extension (CAT-tailing). Reported recently in Cell, Izawa
et al. identify cytosolic Vms1 (VCP/Cdc48-associated mitochondrial
stress-responsive 1) as an inhibitor of CAT-tailing, which prevents mitochondrial
dysfunction caused by imported CAT-tailed polypeptides.
