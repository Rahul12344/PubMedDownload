Tumors induce tolerance toward their antigens by producing the chemokine CCL21,
leading to the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs). Ins2-CCL21
transgenic, nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice express CCL21 in pancreatic β-cells and 
do not develop autoimmune diabetes. We investigated by which mechanisms CCL21
expression prevented diabetes. Ins2-CCL21 mice develop TLOs by 4 weeks of age,
consisting of naive CD4+ T cells compartmentalized within networks of
CD45-gp38+CD31- fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC)-like cells. Importantly,
12-week-old Ins2-CCL21 TLOs contained FRC-like cells with higher contractility,
regulatory, and anti-inflammatory properties and enhanced expression of β-cell
autoantigens compared with nontransgenic NOD TLOs found in inflamed islets.
Consistently, transgenic mice harbored fewer autoreactive T cells and a higher
proportion of regulatory T cells in the islets. Using adoptive transfer and islet
transplantation models, we demonstrate that TLO formation in Ins2-CCL21
transgenic islets is critical for the regulation of autoimmunity, and although
the effect is systemic, the induction is mediated locally likely by lymphocyte
trafficking through TLOs. Overall, our findings suggest that CCL21 promotes TLOs 
that differ from inflammatory TLOs found in type 1 diabetic islets in that they
resemble lymph nodes, contain FRC-like cells expressing β-cell autoantigens, and 
are able to induce systemic and antigen-specific tolerance leading to diabetes
prevention.
