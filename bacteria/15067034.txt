T cell receptor (TCR) internalization by clathrin-coated vesicles after encounter
with antigen has been implicated in the regulation of T cell responses. We
demonstrate that TCR internalization after receptor engagement and TCR signaling 
involves inducible phosphorylation of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) in both CD4+ and
CD8+ human T cells. Studies with mutant Jurkat T cells implicate the Src family
kinase Lck as the responsible enzyme and its activity in this process is
influenced by the functional integrity of the downstream signaling molecule
ZAP-70. CHC phosphorylation positively correlates with ligand-induced TCR
internalization in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CHC phosphorylation as a
result of basal Lck activity is also implicated in constitutive TCR endocytosis
by CD4+ T cells. Remarkably, irreversible CHC phosphorylation in the presence of 
pervanadate reduced both constitutive and ligand-induced TCR internalization in
CD4+ T cells, and immunofluorescence studies revealed that this inhibition
affected the early stages of TCR endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Thus, we
propose that CHC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are involved in TCR
internalization and that this is a regulatory mechanism linking TCR signaling to 
endocytosis.
