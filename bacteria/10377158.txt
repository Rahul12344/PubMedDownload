Nitric oxide (NO) has a central role in host defense against intracellular
microbes. HLA-B27 has been shown to directly modulate host-microbe interaction in
vitro, leading to the impaired elimination of Salmonella in human monocytic U937 
cells. Here, we studied whether impaired elimination of Salmonella would result
from differences in NO production between HLA-B27- and HLA-A2-transfected U937
cells. Both human monocytic transfectants produced NO equally well and killed
Salmonella via NO-independent mechanisms.
