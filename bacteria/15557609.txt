Infection of C57BL/6 mice with Mycobacterium avium leads to the activation of
both CD4+ and CD8+ gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing T cells, although the
CD8+ cells play no role in protection against infection. Using transfer of
different lines of transgenic T cells with T-cell receptors (TCRs) which
recognize irrelevant antigens, we show here that transferred CD8+ T cells from
two of the three lines were activated to the same degree as the host cells,
suggesting that the majority of the IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells of the host 
represented bystander activation. The third line, specific for the male HY
antigen, showed no activation. Activation required the participation of the CD28 
coreceptor on T cells and was unaffected by the removal of CD44(hi) (memory
phenotype) T cells. The transferred CD8+ T cells proliferated in vivo, although
this was not essential for IFN-gamma production. Taken together, these data are
highly reminiscent of homeostatic proliferation of TCR transgenic T cells upon
transfer to lymphopenic hosts, and suggest low-affinity stimulation through the
TCR, possibly by self peptides. The findings are discussed in relation to
homeostatic proliferation and their significance in the possible induction of
autoimmune disease.
