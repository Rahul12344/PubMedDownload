BACKGROUND: OXA-2 is a class D β-lactamase that confers resistance to
penicillins, as well as narrow-spectrum cephalosporins. OXA-2 was recently
reported to also possess carbapenem-hydrolysing activity. Here, we describe a
KPC-2-encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate that demonstrated reduced
susceptibility to ceftazidime and ertapenem due to production of OXA-2.
OBJECTIVES: To elucidate the role of OXA-2 production in reduced ceftazidime and 
ertapenem susceptibility in a K. pneumoniae ST258 clinical isolate.
METHODS: MICs were determined by the agar dilution method. WGS was conducted to
identify and compare resistance genes between isolates. Expression of KPC-2 was
quantified by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. OXA-2 was expressed in
Escherichia coli TOP10, as well as in K. pneumoniae ATCC 13883, to define the
relative contribution of OXA-2 in β-lactam resistance. Kinetic studies were
conducted using purified OXA-2 enzyme.
RESULTS: K. pneumoniae 1761 belonged to ST258 and carried both blaKPC-2 and
blaOXA-2. However, expression of blaKPC-2 was substantially reduced due to an
IS1294 insertion in the promoter region. K. pneumoniae 1761, K. pneumoniae ATCC
13883 and E. coli TOP10 carrying blaOXA-2-harbouring plasmids showed reduced
susceptibility to ertapenem and ceftazidime, but meropenem, imipenem and cefepime
were unaffected. blaOXA-2 was carried on a 2910 bp partial class 1 integron
containing aacA4-blaOXA-2-qacEΔ1-sul1 on an IncA/C2 plasmid, which was not
present in the earlier ST258 isolates possessing blaKPC-2 with intact promoters. 
Hydrolysis of ertapenem by OXA-2 was confirmed using purified enzyme.
CONCLUSIONS: Production of OXA-2 was associated with reduced ceftazidime and
ertapenem susceptibility in a K. pneumoniae ST258 isolate.
