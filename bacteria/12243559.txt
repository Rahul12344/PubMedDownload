Shewanella alga is a gram-negative bacillus found in all types of water as well
as in a variety of tainted food. It has rarely been associated with human
disease, either in healthy or in immunocompromised patients. We report a
66-year-old man with a multiple myeloma who developed a cellulitis in both
forearms in the course of a Shewanella bacteremia. He had a renal insufficiency
and was moderately neutropenic after chemotherapy (vincristine, adriamycin,
dexamethasone). Outcome was good after treatment with ceftazidime-amikacin
despite all the risk factors. Shewanella isolation may be clinically significant.
Haematological patients constitute a group of risk as increasingly aggressive
chemotherapy regimens are used. Clinical outcome is not necessarily bad.
