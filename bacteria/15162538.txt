AIM: To observe competitive inhibition of adherence of enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Clostridium
difficile (C. difficile) to intestinal epithelial cell line Lovo by purified
adhesin of Bifidobacterium adolescentis 1027 (B. ado 1027).
METHODS: The binding of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cell line Lovo was
counted by adhesion assay. The inhibition of adherence of ETEC, EPEC and C.
difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line Lovo by purified adhesin of B. ado
1027 was evaluated quantitatively by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: The purified adhesin at the concentration of 10 microg/mL, 20 microg/mL 
and 30 microg/mL except at 1 microg/mL and 5 microg/mL could inhibit
significantly the adhesion of ETEC, EPEC and C. difficile to intestinal
epithelial cell line Lovo. Moreover, we observed that a reduction in bacterial
adhesion was occurred with increase in the concentration of adhesin, and MFI
(Mean fluorescent intensity) was decreased with increase in the concentration of 
adhesin.
CONCLUSION: The purified adhesin of B. ado 1027 can inhibit the adhesion of ETEC,
EPEC and C. difficile to intestinal epithelial cell line Lovo in a dose-dependent
manner.
