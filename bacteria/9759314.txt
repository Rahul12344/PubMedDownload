Urine collection study is one of the most common means of bacteriological
diagnosis in the laboratory. However, numerous interpretation problems exist. The
aim of this paper is to specify these problems and to indicate the place of rapid
tests in the screening for urinary tract infection. Direct examination must be
performed on rapidly collected and transported urine. In such conditions, absence
or presence of both leukocytes or germs presents a good negative or positive
predictive value. However, false positive leukocyturia is frequent. False
positive bacteriuria is mostly due to bad collection or transport. In some cases 
the threshold of bacteriuria > or = 10(5) cfu/mL can be reduced. Rapid tests
include leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests. In our study, recording 289 tests, 
we observed negative and positive predictive values of respectively, 92% and 100%
when the two tests were used together. Dipsticks can be used to exclude a urinary
tract infection when clinical symptoms are absent, but only if they are used
correctly. When both tests are positive, a urinary tract infection is likely.
Study on urine collection is difficult in children. Collaboration between
clinician and bacteriologist is essential.
