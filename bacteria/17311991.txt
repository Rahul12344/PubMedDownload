Although interactions with bone marrow stromal cells are essential for multiple
myeloma (MM) cell survival, the specific molecular and cellular elements involved
are largely unknown, due in large part to the complexity of the bone marrow
microenvironment itself. The T-cell costimulatory receptor CD28 is also expressed
on normal and malignant plasma cells, and CD28 expression in MM correlates
significantly with poor prognosis and disease progression. In contrast to T
cells, activation and function of CD28 in myeloma cells is largely undefined. We 
have found that direct activation of myeloma cell CD28 by anti-CD28 mAb alone
induces activation of PI3K and NFkappaB, suppresses MM cell proliferation, and
protects against serum starvation and dexamethasone (dex)-induced cell death.
Coculture with dendritic cells (DCs) expressing the CD28 ligands CD80 and CD86
also elicits CD28-mediated effects on MM survival and proliferation, and DCs
appear to preferentially localize within myeloma infiltrates in primary patient
samples. Our findings suggest a previously undescribed myeloma/DC cell-cell
interaction involving CD28 that may play an important role in myeloma cell
survival within the bone marrow stroma. These data also point to CD28 as a
potential therapeutic target in the treatment of MM.
