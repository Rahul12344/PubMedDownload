Normal pregnancy has been considered as a controlled state of inflammation at an 
early stage of blastocyst implantation that subsequently develops systemically.
Till recent past most popular hypotheses regarding status of immune system in
pregnancy were dominated by the Th1 and Th2 hypothesis, in which the fetus avoids
maternal rejection through a bias towards T-helper (Th2) cytokine production.
Recent findings have shown that predominant immune interactions in the human
deciduas are between the placental trophoblast and maternal uterine natural
killer (uNK) cells rather than the T cells. Thus NK cells are emerging as
important players in the uterine immune response to invasive forms of placenta,
as in cases of hemochorial placenta. In humans there is a lack of evidence for
T-cell responses to trophoblast cells; therefore it was thought that uterine NK
cells are the key factors by which the maternal immune system recognizes
trophoblast cells. In this review we are trying to summarize the role of uNK
cells in the maintenance of normal pregnancy in humans.
