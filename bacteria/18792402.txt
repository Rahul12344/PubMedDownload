Regulatory T cells (Treg) play critical roles in maintaining tolerance and
preventing autoimmunity. It is not fully clear how these cells are generated and 
maintained. Here, we show that resting B cells are able to expand Treg. This
expansion requires TGF-beta3 and signaling through the TCR and CD28. Upon
activation, B cells express less TGF-beta3, which reduces their capacity to
expand Treg and which also results in increased Treg death. This may ensure that 
B cells can function as potent professional antigen presenting cells during
infections. However, in the absence of any infection, we find that
B-cell-deficient microMT mice have decreased percentages of Treg in the
periphery. Our data suggest that resting B cells, which may be presenting
self-antigens to T cells, can expand and maintain specific Treg and thus might be
involved in the prevention of autoimmunity.
