The plasmid DNA was purified using the Fractogel EMD TMAE (M) anion exchange
media. The dynamic loading capacity of this media for plasmid DNA was 0.62 mg/mL.
It was found that when the lysate of bacteria was incubated with either Triton
X-114 or Triton X-100 before purification, the average content of endotoxin left 
in the purified plasmid DNA was 6.42 EU/mg or 9.50 EU/mg, respectively. These
results were much lower than that without pre-incubation (67.82 EU/mg). The
purification of plasmid DNA and the removal of endotoxin were achieved in one
step using anion-exchange chromatography. This method is simple, fast and of low 
cost.
