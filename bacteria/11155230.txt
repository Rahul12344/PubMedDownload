Atomic force microscopy was used to visualize the cruciform structure in
supercoiled plasmid pUC8 DNA immobilized on aminomodified mica. The cruciform
hairpin was 14 base pairs in size, as determined from atomic force microscopy
images of pUC8 DNA in air. Molecular modeling confirmed that the cruciform
structure is formed by hairpins with self-complementary homopyrimidine-homopurine
sequences (dT)8(dA)6 and a loop 4 nucleotides long.
