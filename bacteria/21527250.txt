Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that causes chronic active gastritis and
peptic ulcers. Drugs targeting H. pylori phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase
(HpPPAT), which is involved in CoA biosynthesis, may be useful. Herein, we report
the expression in Escherichia coli and purification of recombinant HpPPAT and
describe a crystal structure for an HpPPAT/CoA complex. As is the case for E.
coli PPAT (EcPPAT), HpPPAT is hexameric in solution and as a crystal. Each
protomer has a well-packed dinucleotide-binding fold in which CoA binds.
Structural characterisation demonstrated that CoA derived from the E. coli
expression system bound tightly to HpPPAT, presumably to initiate feedback
inhibition. However, the interactions between the active-site residues of HpPPAT 
and CoA are not identical to those of other PPATs. Finally, CoA binding affects
HpPPAT thermal denaturation.
