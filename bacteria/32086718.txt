Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease that
can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It includes two main
disorders: Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). CD and UC often
share a similar clinical presentation; however, they affect distinct parts of the
GI Tract with a different gut wall inflammatory extent. Ultimately, IBD seems to 
emanate from an uncontrollably continuous inflammatory process arising against
the intestinal microbiome in a genetically susceptible individual. It is a
multifactorial disease stemming from the impact of both environmental and genetic
components on the intestinal microbiome. Furthermore, IBD genetics has gained a
lot of attention. Around 200 loci were identified as imparting an increased risk 
for IBD. Few of them were heavily investigated and determined as highly linked to
IBD. These genes, as discussed below, include NOD2, ATG16L1, IRGM, LRRK2, PTPN2, 
IL23R, Il10, Il10RA, Il10RB, CDH1 and HNF4Î± among others. Consequently, the
incorporation of a genetic panel covering these key genes would markedly enhance 
the diagnosis and evaluation of IBD.
