366 juniors, seniors, and graduate students from seven departments at The Ohio
State University were administered the 10-item Edinburgh Handedness Inventory and
asked questions concerning familial handedness and personal incidence of
allergies or asthma. The rate of left-handedness was 15.6% among the male
students and 12.9% among the females. Maternal handedness was significantly
related to female offspring handedness and to the incidence of allergies and
asthma in both males and females. Departmental incidence of left-handedness
ranged from a low of 7.5% (Microbiology) to a high of 21.7% (Law).
