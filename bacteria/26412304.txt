Endogenous formaldehyde is produced by numerous biochemical pathways fundamental 
to life, and it can crosslink both DNA and proteins. However, the consequences of
its accumulation are unclear. Here we show that endogenous formaldehyde is
removed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5/GSNOR), and Adh5(-/-) mice
therefore accumulate formaldehyde adducts in DNA. The repair of this damage is
mediated by FANCD2, a DNA crosslink repair protein. Adh5(-/-)Fancd2(-/-) mice
reveal an essential requirement for these protection mechanisms in hematopoietic 
stem cells (HSCs), leading to their depletion and precipitating bone marrow
failure. More widespread formaldehyde-induced DNA damage also causes karyomegaly 
and dysfunction of hepatocytes and nephrons. Bone marrow transplantation not only
rescued hematopoiesis but, surprisingly, also preserved nephron function.
Nevertheless, all of these animals eventually developed fatal malignancies.
Formaldehyde is therefore an important source of endogenous DNA damage that is
counteracted in mammals by a conserved protection mechanism.
