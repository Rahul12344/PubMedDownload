Behcet's disease is a chronic multisystemic disease with remissions and relapses.
Several studies have shown that immune mechanisms play an important role in the
development of the disease. In order to assess the association of disease
activity with IL-17A/F, IL-23, IL-12/23 (p40) and IL-35 expression, we aimed to
investigate production of these cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from Behcet's patients and normal controls. Furthermore, we included
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) as disease control to evaluate the specificity
of our data for immunopathogenesis of BD. Totally 15 active, 15 inactive Behcet's
patients, 12 active and 12 inactive SLE patients and 12 healthy volunteers were
enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated,
lymphocyte cultures were performed and IL-17A/F, IL-12/23 p(40), IL-23, IL-35
cytokine levels were measured by ELISA in culture supernatants in the presence or
absence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) on time-dependent manner. IL-17 A/F levels
increased parallel to IL-23 levels in Behcet's and SLE patients. Compared to
healthy controls, IL-17 A/F levels were higher in active Behcet's and SLE
patients; on the contrary, levels of IL-35 were lower. IL-17A/F, IL-12/23 (p40)
and IL-23 levels were detectable most frequently in active Behcet's patients
followed by active SLE patients. Our results indicate that IL-17 A/F, IL-23 and
IL-12/23 (p40) may play role in the immunopathogenesis of BD so as Th17 and Th1
cell responses. Since IL-35 levels were lower in active Behcet's patients
compared to inactive patients and healthy controls, there may be a plasticity
between Th17 and Treg cells according to the state of disease activity.
