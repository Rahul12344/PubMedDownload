Paratuberculosis (PTB) is caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis
(MAP) and is one of the most widespread and economically important diseases in
cattle. After birth, calves are raised with natural breast feeding without
separation from their mothers in most Korean native cattle (Hanwoo breed) farms. 
Vertical transmission of PTB has been reported, but the exact PTB infection route
has not been revealed in Hanwoo farms. Calves of MAP seropositive dams were
tested for MAP presence and MAP antibodies in feces and tissues. MAP was detected
in calf tissues by using polymerase chain reaction. Expressions of genes reported
to be prognostic biomarkers of MAP infection changed in both calves and cows (p ＜
0.05). Expression of two genes (HGF and SERPINE1) were significantly decreased in
MAP-infected cattle and their offspring (p ＜ 0.01). The results suggest that
biomarker gene expression profiles can be useful in detecting early stage MAP
infection. Based on the results, complete eradication of MAP may be possible if
accurate diagnostic methods to detect infected calves are added to the current
PTB eradication strategy, which, because infected individuals are likely to
develop into fecal MAP shedders at any time, includes isolation of new born
calves and feeding sterilized colostrum.
