An obstacle to the development of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells is the 
limited understanding of CAR T-cell biology and the mechanisms behind their
antitumor activity. We and others have shown that CARs with a CD28 costimulatory 
domain drive high T-cell activation, which leads to exhaustion and shortened
persistence. This work led us to hypothesize that by incorporating null mutations
of CD28 subdomains (YMNM, PRRP, or PYAP), we could optimize CAR T-cell
costimulation and enhance function. In vivo, we found that mice given CAR T cells
with only a PYAP CD28 endodomain had a significant survival advantage, with 100% 
of mice alive after 62 days compared with 50% for mice with an unmutated
endodomain. We observed that mutant CAR T cells remained more sensitive to
antigen after ex vivo antigen and PD-L1 stimulation, as demonstrated by increased
cytokine production. The mutant CAR T cells also had a reduction of
exhaustion-related transcription factors and genes such as Nfatc1, Nr42a, and
Pdcd1 Our results demonstrated that CAR T cells with a mutant CD28 endodomain
have better survival and function. This work allows for the development of
enhanced CAR T-cell therapies by optimizing CAR T-cell costimulation.
