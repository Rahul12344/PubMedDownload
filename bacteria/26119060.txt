The mechanisms and organisms involved in the natural formation of volatile
organohalogen compounds (VOX) are largely unknown. We provide evidence that the
common and widespread soil bacterium Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021 is
capable of producing up to 3338·6 ± 327·8 ng l(-1) headspace volume of chloroform
(CHCl3 ) and 807·8 ± 13·5 ng l(-1)  headspace volume of tetrachloroethene (C2 Cl4
) within 1 h when grown in soil extract medium. Biotic VOX formation has been
suggested to be linked to the activity of halogenating enzymes such as
haloperoxidases. We tested if the observed VOX formation by S. meliloti can be
attributed to one of its chloroperoxidases (Smc01944) that is highly expressed in
the presence of H2 O2. However, addition of 10 mmol l(-1) H2 O2 to the
S. meliloti cultures decreased VOX formation by 52% for chloroform and 25% for
tetrachloroethene, while viable cell numbers decreased by 23%. Interestingly,
smc01944 gene expression increased 450-fold. The quantification of extracellular 
chlorination activity in cell suspension experiments did not provide evidence for
a role of S. meliloti chloroperoxidases in the observed VOX formation. This
suggests that a momentarily unknown mechanism which requires no H2 O2 might be
responsible for the VOX formation by S. meliloti. Regardless of the underlying
mechanism our results suggest that the soil bacterium S. meliloti might be an
important source of VOX in soils.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Volatile
organohalogen compounds (VOX) strongly influence atmospheric chemistry and
Earth's climate. Besides anthropogenic emissions they are naturally produced by
either abiotic or biotic pathways in various environments. Particularly in soils,
microbial processes drive the natural halogen cycle but the direct link to
microbial VOX formation has not been studied in detail yet. In this study we
provide evidence that the common and widespread soil bacterium Sinorhizobium
meliloti strain 1021 forms chloroform and tetrachloroethene. The potential
contribution of S. meliloti to soil VOX release could significantly influence
soil and atmospheric chemistry.
