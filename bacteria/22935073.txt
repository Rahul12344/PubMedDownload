BACKGROUND: Allergy to peanuts results in severe anaphylactic responses in
affected individuals, and has dramatic effects on society and public policy.
Despite the health impacts of peanut-induced anaphylaxis (PIA), relatively little
is known about immune mechanisms underlying the disease. Using a mouse model of
PIA, we evaluated mice with deletions in four distinct immune molecules (IL7Rα,
L-selectin, CD34, CD103), for perturbed responses.
METHODS: PIA was induced by intragastric sensitization with peanut antigen and
cholera toxin adjuvant, followed by intraperitoneal challenge with crude peanut
extract (CPE). Disease outcome was assessed by monitoring body temperature,
clinical symptoms, and serum histamine levels. Resistant mice were evaluated for 
total and antigen specific serum IgE, as well as susceptibility to passive
systemic anaphylaxis.
RESULTS: PIA responses were dramatically reduced in IL7Rα-/- and L-selectin-/-
mice, despite normal peanut-specific IgE production and susceptibility to passive
systemic anaphylaxis. In contrast, CD34-/- and CD103-/- mice exhibited robust PIA
responses, indistinguishable from wild type controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Loss of L-selectin or IL7Rα function is sufficient to impair PIA,
while CD34 or CD103 ablation has no effect on disease severity. More broadly, our
findings suggest that future food allergy interventions should focus on
disrupting sensitization to food allergens and limiting antigen-specific
late-phase responses. Conversely, therapies targeting immune cell migration
following antigen challenge are unlikely to have significant benefits,
particularly considering the rapid kinetics of PIA.
