The protease activity of the paracaspase mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1) plays an important role in antigen
receptor-mediated lymphocyte activation by controlling the activity of the
transcription factor nuclear factor-κB and is thus essential for the expression
of inflammatory target genes. MALT1 is not only present in cells of the
hematopoietic lineage, but is ubiquitously expressed. Here we report that
stimulation with zymosan or Staphylococcus aureus induced MALT1 protease activity
in human primary keratinocytes. Inhibition of the Src family of kinases or novel 
protein kinase C isoforms as well as silencing of CARMA2 or BCL10 interfered with
activation of MALT1 protease. Silencing or inhibition of MALT1 protease strongly 
decreased the expression of important inflammatory genes such as TNFα, IL-17C,
CXCL8 and HBD-2. MALT1-inhibited cells were unable to mount an antimicrobial
response upon zymosan stimulation or phorbolester/ionomycin treatment,
demonstrating a central role of MALT1 protease activity in keratinocyte immunity 
and suggesting MALT1 as a potential target in inflammatory skin diseases.
