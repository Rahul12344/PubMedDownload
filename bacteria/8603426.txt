CD4+ T cells from mice with murine AIDS (MAIDS) have been shown to be unable to
respond to TCR stimulation as measured by proliferation, IL-2 production, or
IL-2R upregulation, although responsiveness was restored with PMA and ionomycin. 
In this report we have demonstrated that the inability of MAIDS CD4+ T cells to
respond to CD3 stimulation was not associated with reduced surface expression of 
CD3, CD4, or CD28 and could not be overcome by costimulation with anti-CD28
antibody. However, MAIDS CD4+ T cells failed to activate the PIP2 hydrolysis
pathway efficiently, resulting in diminished IP3 production and reduced Ca2+
mobilization compared to normal controls. Additionally, TCR signaling in MAIDS
resulted in a reduction in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of some proteins
including deficient tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma 1, compared to normal
CD4+ T cells. These studies suggest that stimulation through the TCR in CD4+ T
cells from MAIDS-infected mice is uncoupled from the phosphotidylinositol
hydrolysis pathway due to deficient activation of PLC-gamma 1.
