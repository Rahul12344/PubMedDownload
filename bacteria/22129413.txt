Culex quinquefasciatus, an arboviral and filarial vector, is present in high
numbers throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and insecticide-resistant populations have
been reported worldwide. In order to determine the insecticide resistance status 
of Cx. quinquefasciatus in Macha, Zambia, adult mosquitoes reared from eggs
collected from oviposition traps were tested by bioassay. High levels of
resistance to DDT, pyrethroids, malathion, and deltamethrin-treated net material 
were detected, and molecular assays revealed that the knockdown resistance (kdr) 
allele was frequent in the Cx. quinquefasciatus population, with 7.0% homozygous 
for the kdr L1014 allele and 38.5% heterozygous (0.263 kdr frequency). The kdr
frequency was significantly higher in mosquitoes that had successfully fed on
human hosts, and screening archived specimens revealed that kdr was present at
lower frequency prior to the introduction of ITNs, indicating that ITNs might be 
a selective force in this population. Additionally, metabolic detoxification
enzyme activity assays showed upregulated glutathione S-transferases,
α-esterases, and β-esterases. Continued monitoring and assessment of the Cx.
quinquefasciatus population is necessary to determine levels of resistance.
