Antibodies (Abs) have been engineered into small antigen-binding fragments and
rebuilt into multivalent high-avidity molecules for improving in vivo
pharmacokinetics and efficacy in clinical use. To increase the avidity of a
T-cell receptor-like single-domain Ab (sdAb) specific for HLA-A2 complex, we
fused the sdAb to a coiled-coil peptide derived from human cartilage oligomeric
matrix protein (COMP48) to make an sdAb multimer, termed combody. The combody
improved the binding avidity of sdAb significantly, whereas the specificity for
the targeted cells was retained. The strategy was also expanded to create a
bispecific combody by fusing an sdAb to the N-terminal and an anti-CD3
single-chain variable fragment to the C-terminal of COMP48. The dual-specific
combody was able to efficiently mediate cytotoxicity against the target cells in 
vitro. Taken together, the strategy to make combody could be widely adopted to
increase the avidity of Ab fragment for further application.
