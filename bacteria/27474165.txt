Macrophages are key regulators of fibrosis development and resolution.
Elucidating the mechanisms by which they mediate this process is crucial for
establishing their therapeutic potential. Here, we use experimental models of
liver fibrosis to show that deficiency of the scavenger receptor, stabilin-1,
exacerbates fibrosis and delays resolution during the recovery phase. We detected
a subset of stabilin-1(+) macrophages that were induced at sites of cellular
injury close to the hepatic scar in mouse models of liver fibrosis and in human
liver disease. Stabilin-1 deficiency abrogated malondialdehyde-LDL (MDA-LDL)
uptake by hepatic macrophages and was associated with excess collagen III
deposition. Mechanistically, the lack of stabilin-1 led to elevated intrahepatic 
levels of the profibrogenic chemokine CCL3 and an increase in GFAP(+) fibrogenic 
cells. Stabilin-1(-/-) macrophages demonstrated a proinflammatory phenotype
during liver injury and the normal induction of Ly6C(lo) monocytes during
resolution was absent in stabilin-1 knockouts leading to persistence of fibrosis.
Human stabilin-1(+) monocytes efficiently internalized MDA-LDL and this
suppressed their ability to secrete CCL3, suggesting that loss of stabilin-1
removes a brake to CCL3 secretion. Experiments with cell-lineage-specific
knockouts revealed that stabilin-1 expression in myeloid cells is required for
the induction of this subset of macrophages and that increased fibrosis occurs in
their absence. This study demonstrates a previously unidentified regulatory
pathway in fibrogenesis in which a macrophage scavenger receptor protects against
organ fibrosis by removing fibrogenic products of lipid peroxidation. Thus,
stabilin-1(+) macrophages shape the tissue microenvironment during liver injury
and healing.
