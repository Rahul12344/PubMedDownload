OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of orally administered Bifidobacterium animalis
subsp. lactis BB-12 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on the salivary levels of
Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-8, MMP-9 and of Tissue Inhibitor of
Metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 in healthy adults. Furthermore, the correlations
between MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and plaque and gingival indices, salivary mutans 
streptococci and lactobacilli counts, and stimulated saliva secretion rate were
analysed.
DESIGN: The salivary samples originated from a randomized controlled trial where 
healthy student volunteers consumed probiotic or placebo lozenges twice a day for
four weeks. The saliva samples were collected and clinical parameters measured at
the baseline and at the end of the original study. For this study, the salivary
levels of MMP-8, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were analysed with immunofluorometric assay
(IFMA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: In the probiotic group (n=29), salivary MMP-9 levels increased (p<0.01) 
and TIMP-1 levels decreased (p<0.01) significantly during the intervention.
Furthermore, MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio differed significantly from the baseline level
(p<0.01). These changes were not observed in the control group (n=31). In the
whole data, salivary MMP-9 and gingival index correlated (r=0.260, p<0.05 at
baseline and r=0.354, p<0.01 at the end of the study). Intergroup differences or 
correlations with other clinical parameters were not found. Probiotic consumption
did not affect the saliva flow rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased MMP-9 and decreased TIMP-1 levels in saliva may indicate
that probiotics have immunomodulatory effects in the oral cavity. Furthermore,
increased salivary MMP-9 levels may be an indication of the defensive potential
of matrix metalloproteinases.
