[Significance of plaques for the etiology of caries and marginal
periodontopathies (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

BÃ¶ssmann K.

The genesis of dental caries and marginal periodontopathies has a conclusive
connection with dento-gingival plaque. Plaque is a constantly regenerating
accumulation of salivary constituents and especially of various oral
micoorganisms. Microbial decomposition of sugars from the food produces acids
from fermentation which lead to local demineralization of the teeth and carious
destruction. Antigenic plaque substances cause immunological reactions. With
persistent bad oral hygiene, a gingivitis may develop into a progressive
periodontitis with deepened gingival pockets.
