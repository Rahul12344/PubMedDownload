Heart disease is associated with the accumulation of resident cardiac fibroblasts
(CFs) that secrete extracellular matrix (ECM), leading to the development of
pathological fibrosis and heart failure. However, the mechanisms underlying
resident CF proliferation remain poorly defined. Here, we report that small
proline-rich protein 2b (Sprr2b) is among the most up-regulated genes in CFs
during heart disease. We demonstrate that SPRR2B is a regulatory subunit of the
USP7/MDM2-containing ubiquitination complex. SPRR2B stimulates the accumulation
of MDM2 and the degradation of p53, thus facilitating the proliferation of
pathological CFs. Furthermore, SPRR2B phosphorylation by nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases in response to TGF-Î²1 signaling and free-radical production potentiates
SPRR2B activity and cell cycle progression. Knockdown of the Sprr2b gene or
inhibition of SPRR2B phosphorylation attenuates USP7/MDM2 binding and p53
degradation, leading to CF cell cycle arrest. Importantly, SPRR2B expression is
elevated in cardiac tissue from human heart failure patients and correlates with 
the proliferative state of patient-derived CFs in a process that is reversed by
insulin growth factor-1 signaling. These data establish SPRR2B as a unique
component of the USP7/MDM2 ubiquitination complex that drives p53 degradation, CF
accumulation, and the development of pathological cardiac fibrosis.
