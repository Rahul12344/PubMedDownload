Optimal T-cell activation requires both an antigen-specific signal delivered
through the T-cell receptor and a costimulatory signal which can be delivered
through the CD28 molecule. CD28 costimulation induces the expression of multiple 
lymphokines, including interleukin 2 (IL-2). Because the c-Rel transcription
factor bound to and activated the CD28 response element within the IL-2 promoter,
we focused our study on the mechanism of CD28-mediated regulation of c-Rel in
human peripheral blood T cells. We showed that CD28 costimulation accelerated the
kinetics of nuclear translocation of c-Rel (and its phosphorylated form), p50
(NFKB1), and p65 (RelA). The enhanced nuclear translocation of c-Rel correlated
with the stimulation of Il-2 production and T-cell proliferation by several
distinct anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. This is explained at least in part by
the long-term downregulation of I kappa B alpha following CD28 signalling as
opposed to phorbol myristate acetate alone. Furthermore, we showed that the
c-Rel-containing CD28-responsive complex is enhanced by, but not specific to,
CD28 costimulation. Our results indicate that c-Rel is one of the transcription
factors targeted by CD28 signalling.
