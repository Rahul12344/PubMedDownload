Currently there are no curative therapies available for patients with metastatic 
prostate cancer. Thus, novel therapies are needed to treat this patient
population. Immunotherapy represents one promising approach for the elimination
of occult metastatic tumors. However, the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME)
represents a hostile environment capable of suppressing anti-tumor immunity and
effector cell function. In view of this immunosuppressive activity, we engineered
murine prostate cancer cells with regulated expression (tet-on) of CCL21.
Prostate tumor cells implanted orthotopically produced primary prostate tumors
with predictable metastatic disease in draining lymph nodes and distant organs.
Expression of CCL21 in the prostate TME enhanced survival, inhibited tumor growth
and decreased the frequency of local (draining lymph node) and distant
metastasis. Therefore, these studies provide a strong rationale for further
evaluation of CCL21 in tumor immunity and its use in cancer immunotherapy.
