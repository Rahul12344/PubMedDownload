The hallmark of Salmonella Typhimurium infection is an acute intestinal
inflammatory response, which is mediated through the action of secreted bacterial
effector proteins. The pro-inflammatory Salmonella effector SopA is a HECT-like
E3 ligase, which was previously proposed to activate host RING ligases TRIM56 and
TRIM65. Here we elucidate an inhibitory mechanism of TRIM56 and TRIM65 targeting 
by SopA. We present the crystal structure of SopA in complex with the RING domain
of human TRIM56, revealing the atomic details of their interaction and the basis 
for SopA selectivity towards TRIM56 and TRIM65. Structure-guided biochemical
analysis shows that SopA inhibits TRIM56 E3 ligase activity by occluding the
E2-interacting surface of TRIM56. We further demonstrate that SopA ubiquitinates 
TRIM56 and TRIM65, resulting in their proteasomal degradation during infection.
Our results provide the basis for how a bacterial HECT ligase blocks host RING
ligases and exemplifies the multivalent power of bacterial effectors during
infection.
