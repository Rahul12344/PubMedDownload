Thioesterase superfamily member 2 (THEM2) is essential for cell proliferation of 
mammalian cells. It belongs to the hotdog-fold thioesterase superfamily and
catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thioester bonds of acyl-CoA in vitro. In this
study, THEM2 protein from zebrafish (fTHEM2) was expressed in Escherichia coli
and purified by Ni-affinity and gel-filtration chromatography. fTHEM2 crystals
were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method with PEG 10 000 as
precipitant. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.80 Å resolution using a
synchrotron-radiation source. The crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group
C2, with unit-cell parameters a=77.1, b=74.4, c=96.6 Å, β=93.7°.
