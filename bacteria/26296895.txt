The cholesterol storage disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is caused by
defects in either of two late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, NPC1 and NPC2. NPC2
is a 16-kDa soluble protein that binds cholesterol in a 1:1 stoichiometry and can
transfer cholesterol between membranes by a mechanism that involves
protein-membrane interactions. To examine the structural basis of NPC2 function
in cholesterol trafficking, a series of point mutations were generated across the
surface of the protein. Several NPC2 mutants exhibited deficient sterol transport
properties in a set of fluorescence-based assays. Notably, these mutants were
also unable to promote egress of accumulated intracellular cholesterol from
npc2(-/-) fibroblasts. The mutations mapped to several regions on the protein
surface, suggesting that NPC2 can bind to more than one membrane simultaneously. 
Indeed, we have previously demonstrated that WT NPC2 promotes vesicle-vesicle
interactions. These interactions were abrogated, however, by mutations causing
defective sterol transfer properties. Molecular modeling shows that NPC2 is
highly plastic, with several intense positively charged regions across the
surface that could interact favorably with negatively charged membrane
phospholipids. The point mutations generated in this study caused changes in NPC2
surface charge distribution with minimal conformational changes. The plasticity, 
coupled with membrane flexibility, probably allows for multiple cholesterol
transfer routes. Thus, we hypothesize that, in part, NPC2 rapidly traffics
cholesterol between closely appositioned membranes within the multilamellar
interior of late endosomal/lysosomal proteins, ultimately effecting cholesterol
egress from this compartment.
