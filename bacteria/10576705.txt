An extraction method was developed to recover organochlorine pesticides (OCPs)
associated with live and mercuric chloride-treated fungal mycelia. A Cladosporium
sp. was inoculated into potato dextrose broth, DDT (90 mg/l) added and incubated 
for seven days. The combination of a microextraction procedure for
aqueous-phase-associated DDT and a sonication extraction for mycelia-bound DDT,
using dichloromethane as the extracting solvent, resulted in the recovery of
31-51% of added DDT. DDT recovery was increased to 62-65% by grinding the fungal 
mycelia before sonication. Alkali and nitric acid pretreatments were tested to
increase the recovery of DDT associated with fungal mycelia, however, these
treatments resulted in the production of unidentified DDT transformation
products. Pretreating mycelia containing DDT in concentrated hydrochloric acid at
60 degrees C for 2, 4 and 6 h resulted in DDT recoveries of 90-91%, 99% and
101-102% respectively without the production of transformation products. When an 
OCP mixture (DDT, DDD and DDE) was added to fungal mycelia, between 89% and 96%
of DDT, DDD and DDE were recovered from live cultures compared to 85-91% in
mercuric chloride-treated cultures using the microextraction/hydrochloric acid
pretreatment (60 degrees C/6 h) sonication extraction method.
