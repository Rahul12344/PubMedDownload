Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that are essential for innate
and adaptive immunity. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is critical for NK 
cell development; however, the independent roles of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in
regulating this process remain unknown. Ncr1iCre-mediated deletion of Rptor or
Rictor in mice results in altered homeostatic NK cellularity and impaired
development at distinct stages. The transition from the CD27+CD11b- to the
CD27+CD11b+ stage is impaired in Rptor cKO mice, while, the terminal maturation
from the CD27+CD11b+ to the CD27-CD11b+ stage is compromised in Rictor cKO mice. 
Mechanistically, Raptor-deficiency renders substantial alteration of the gene
expression profile including transcription factors governing early NK cell
development. Comparatively, loss of Rictor causes more restricted transcriptome
changes. The reduced expression of T-bet correlates with the terminal maturation 
defects and results from impaired mTORC2-AktS473-FoxO1 signaling. Collectively,
our results reveal the divergent roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in NK cell
development.
