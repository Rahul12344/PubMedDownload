The dysregulated, unbalanced immune response of sepsis results in a mortality
exceeding 20%, yet recent findings by our group indicate that patients with
allergic, type 2-mediated immune diseases are protected from developing sepsis.
We evaluated CD4+ Th cell polarization among patients with Staphylococcus aureus 
bacteremia and confirmed that survivors had a higher percentage of circulating
Th2 cells but lower frequencies of Th17 cells and neutrophils early in the course
of infection. To establish the mechanism of this protection, we used a mouse
model of lethal S. aureus bacteremia and found that intratracheal pretreatment
with the type 2-initiating cytokine IL-33 activated pulmonary type 2 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC2s) and promoted eosinophilia. In addition, stimulation of
type 2 immunity before lethal infection suppressed the pulmonary neutrophilic
response to S. aureus. Mice lacking functional ILC2s did not respond to IL-33 and
were not protected from lethal bacteremia, but treatment of these mice with the
type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 rescued them from death. Depletion of eosinophils
abrogated IL-33-mediated protection, indicating that eosinophilia is also
necessary for the survival benefit. Thus, we have identified a potentially novel 
mechanism by which type 2 immunity can balance dysregulated septic inflammatory
responses, thereby clarifying the protective benefit of type 2 immune diseases on
sepsis mortality.
