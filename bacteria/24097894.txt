BACKGROUND: By using proteomics and bioinformatics, we have previously identified
a group of highly pancreas-specific proteins as candidate pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) biomarkers. With the use of commercially available ELISAs, 
the performance of some of these candidates was initially evaluated in a
relatively small serum cohort (n = 100 samples). This phase revealed that CUB and
zona pellucida-like domains protein 1 (CUZD1) may represent a new, promising PDAC
biomarker.
METHODS: We performed detailed experiments to investigate the specificity of the 
commercial CUZD1 ELISA assay. CUZD1 was expressed in house in both bacteria and
yeast expression systems. Recombinant CUZD1 and biological samples containing
CUZD1, as well as commercial CUZD1 ELISA standards, were analyzed by Western
blot, size exclusion HPLC, and mass spectrometry (LC-MS Orbitrap).
RESULTS: We confirmed that instead of CUZD1, the commercial assay is recognizing 
a nonhomologous, known cancer antigen [cancer antigen 125 (CA125)].
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that poor characterization of commercial ELISA assays is
a factor that could lead to false biomarker discovery. To our knowledge, this is 
the first report documenting that a commercial ELISA marketed for one analyte
(CUZD1) may, in fact, recognize a different, nonhomologous antigen (CA125).
