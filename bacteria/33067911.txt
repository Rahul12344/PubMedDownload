BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial therapy is recommended to eradicate Helicobacter (H.)
pylori in infected individuals. As first-line treatments are empiric, knowledge
of antimicrobial resistance is key to successful eradication.
AIMS: We investigated primary resistance in an eastern German region to derive
recommendations for eradication treatment.
METHODS: We used molecular genetic methods to examine Helicobacter rapid urease
test (RUT) positive gastric specimens of 533 patients from Berlin and the federal
state of Brandenburg with allegedly no prior eradication treatment. Tissue
samples were removed from RUT and screened by real-time PCR for mutations
conferring resistance to clarithromycin. In addition, 182 samples out of 533 were
tested for resistance to levofloxacin and tetracycline.
RESULTS: Primary resistances were 10.9% (58 out of 533) to clarithromycin; 13.7% 
(25/182) to levofloxacin; and 2.2% to tetracycline (4/182). Combined resistance
to clarithromycin/levofloxacin was low (2.2%, 4/182). Female sex was
significantly associated with clarithromycin resistance.
CONCLUSION: Clarithromycin may be a suitable first-line antibiotic for about 90% 
of outpatients. A simple molecular test may help physicians avoid prescription of
an ineffective first-line regimen.
