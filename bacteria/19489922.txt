Relapsing fever, caused by spirochaetes belonging to the genus Borrelia, was once
the cause of worldwide epidemic disease. This was largely through infection with 
the louse-borne form of the disease, caused by Borrelia recurrentis (louse-borne 
relapsing fever (LBRF)). During the last century, we have witnessed the demise of
this infection, largely owing to improved standards of living and the
introduction of the insecticide DDT, resulting in a reduction in the incidence of
the body louse, the vector for relapsing fever. In areas of extreme poverty this 
disease persists, causing a significant burden of disease. It is now looking
probable that this infection is caused by a louse-adapted variant of Borrelia
duttonii, transmitted by Ornithodoros moubata 'soft' ticks in East Africa. Like
LBRF, infection still causes impact, particularly affecting young children and
pregnant women. Over recent years, the true burden of relapsing fever caused by
infection with the closely related Borrelia crocidurae, transmitted by
Ornithodoros sonrai ticks, has only just begun to emerge. Here, the current state
of knowledge concerning relapsing fever in Africa is reviewed.
