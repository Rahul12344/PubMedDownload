Flavobacterium psychrophilum is the causative agent of the fish diseases called
bacterial cold-water disease and rainbow trout fry syndrome. It has been reported
that some isolates of F. psychrophilum are resistant to quinolones; however, the 
mechanism of this quinolone resistance has been unexplained. In this study, we
examined the quinolone susceptibility patterns of 27 F. psychrophilum strains
isolated in Japan and the United States. Out of 27 isolates, 14 were resistant to
both nalidixic acid (NA) and oxolinic acid (OXA), and the others were susceptible
to NA and OXA. When amino acid sequences deduced from gyrA nucleotide sequences
of all isolates tested were analyzed, two amino acid substitutions (a threonine
residue replaced by an alanine or isoleucine residue in position 83 of GyrA
[Escherichia coli numbering] and an aspartic acid residue replaced by a tyrosine 
residue in position 87) were observed in the 14 quinolone-resistant isolates.
These results strongly suggest that, as in other gram-negative bacteria, DNA
gyrase is an important target for quinolones in F. psychrophilum.
