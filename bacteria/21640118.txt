BACKGROUND & AIMS: Some cancer cells have activities that are similar to those of
stem cells from normal tissues, and cell dedifferentiation correlates with poor
prognosis. Little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the stem cell-like 
features of cancer cells; we investigated genes associated with stem cell-like
features of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells.
METHODS: We isolated colonospheres from primary CRC tissues and cell lines and
characterized their gene expression patterns by microarray analysis. We also
investigated the biological features of the colonosphere cells.
RESULTS: Expanded CRC colonospheres contained cells that expressed high levels of
CD44 and CD166, which are markers of colon cancer stem cells, and had many
features of cancer stem cells, including chemoresistance and radioresistance, the
ability to initiate tumor formation, and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). SNAIL, an activator of EMT, was expressed at high levels by CRC
colonospheres. Overexpression of Snail in CRC cells induced most properties of
colonospheres, including cell dedifferentiation. Two hundred twenty-seven
SNAIL-activated genes were up-regulated in colonospheres; gene regulatory
networks centered around interleukin (IL)-8 and JUN. Blocking IL-8 expression or 
activity disrupted SNAIL-induced stem cell-like features of colonospheres. We
observed that SNAIL activated the expression of IL8 by direct binding to its
E3/E4 E-boxes. In CRC tissues, SNAIL and IL-8 were coexpressed with the stem cell
marker CD44 but not with CD133 or CD24.
CONCLUSIONS: In human CRC tissues, SNAIL regulates expression of IL-8 and other
genes to induce cancer stem cell activities. Strategies that disrupt this pathway
might be developed to block tumor formation by cancer stem cells.
