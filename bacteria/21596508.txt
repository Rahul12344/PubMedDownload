In this study two actinomycete strains were isolated in Cape Town (South Africa),
one from a compost heap (strain 202GMO(T)) and the other from within the
fynbos-rich area surrounded by the horseracing track at Kenilworth Racecourse
(strain C2). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence BLAST analysis, the strains were
identified as members of the genus Nocardia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that
the strains clustered together and are most closely related to Nocardia
flavorosea NRRL B-16176(T), Nocardia testacea JCM 12235(T), Nocardia sienata IFM 
10088(T) and Nocardia carnea DSM 43397(T). This association was also supported by
gyrB based phylogenetic analysis. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization and
physiological tests allowed genotypic and phenotypic differentiation of both
strains 202GMO(T) and C2 from related species. However, their high DNA
relatedness showed that they belong to the same species. Strain 202GMO(T) was
selected as the type strain to represent this novel species, for which the name
Nocardia rhamnosiphila is proposed (=DSM 45147(T)=NRRL B-24637(T)).
