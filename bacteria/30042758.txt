The aim of the present study was to characterize sporadic cases and an outbreak
of NDM-like-producing Enterobacteriaceae recovered from hospital settings, in
Czechia. During 2016, 18 Entrobacteriaceae isolates including 10 Enterobacter
cloacae complex (9 E. xiangfangensis and 1 E. asburiae), 4 Escherichia coli, 1
Kluyvera intermedia, 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, and 1
Raoultella ornithinolytica that produced NDM-like carbapenemases were isolated
from 15 patients. Three of the patients were colonized or infected by two
different NDM-like producers. Moreover, an NDM-4-producing isolate of E. cloacae 
complex, isolated in 2012, was studied for comparative purposes. All isolates of 
E. cloacae complex, except the E. asburiae, recovered from the same hospital,
were assigned to ST182. Additionally, two E. coli belonged to ST167, while the
remaining isolates were not clonally related. Thirteen isolates carried blaNDM-4,
while six isolates carried blaNDM-1 (n = 3) or blaNDM-5 (n = 3). Almost all
isolates carried blaNDM-like-carrying plasmids being positive for the IncX3
allele, except ST58 E. coli and ST14 K. pneumoniae isolates producing NDM-1.
Analysis of plasmid sequences revealed that all IncX3 blaNDM-like-carrying
plasmids exhibited a high similarity to each other and to previously described
plasmids, like pNDM-QD28, reported from worldwide. However, NDM-4-encoding
plasmids differed from other IncX3 plasmids by the insertion of a Tn3-like
transposon. On the other hand, the ST58 E. coli and ST14 K. pneumoniae isolates
carried two novel NDM-1-encoding plasmids, pKpn-35963cz, and pEsco-36073cz.
Plasmid pKpn-35963cz that was an IncFIB(K) molecule contained an acquired
sequence, encoding NDM-1 metallo-β-lactamase (MβL), which exhibited high
similarity to the mosaic region of pS-3002cz from an ST11 K. pneumoniae from
Czechia. Finally, pEsco-36073cz was a multireplicon A/C2+R NDM-1-encoding
plasmid. Similar to other type 1 A/C2 plasmids, the blaNDM-1 gene was located
within the ARI-A resistance island. These findings underlined that IncX3 plasmids
have played a major role in the dissemination of blaNDM-like genes in Czech
hospitals. In combination with further evolvement of NDM-like-encoding MDR
plasmids through reshuffling, NDM-like producers pose an important public threat.
