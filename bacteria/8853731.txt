OBJECTIVE: In HIV-infected patients there is an increased frequency of fungal
infections. Dysregulation of the response of phagocytic cells to fungal pathogens
may be involved.
DESIGN: Phagocytosis of Candida spp., consecutive intracellular production of
reactive oxygen species, and candicidal activity were analysed in
polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PML) from HIV-1-infected patients, who were at
stage C3 of the 1993 revised Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
classification system, by means of flow cytometry.
METHODS: Phagocytic ability was assessed by measuring uptake of fluorescein
isothiocyanate-labelled Candida albicans, C. krusei and C. glabrata. Reactive
oxygen intermediate production was estimated by the quantity of
dihydrorhodamine-123 converted to rhodamine-123 intracellularly. The candicidal
effect was assessed by the propidium iodide uptake of killed yeast cells.
RESULTS: As compared to PML of healthy, HIV-negative controls, PML of AIDS
patients exhibited an increased phagocytic activity and a similar ability to
generate reactive oxygen products. In contrast, PML of AIDS patients displayed a 
decreased candicidal activity (P < 0.05 compared to controls).
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in patients with advanced HIV-1 infection 
the impairment of non-oxidative killing mechanisms of phagocytic cells may
contribute to the high incidence of fungal infections.
