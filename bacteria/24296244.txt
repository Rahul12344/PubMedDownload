The detailed mechanisms of prion-induced neurotoxicity are largely unknown. Here,
we have studied the role of DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species in a
mouse scrapie model by characterizing prion disease in the ogg1(-/-)mutyh(-/-)
double knockout, which is compromised in oxidative DNA base excision repair. Ogg1
initiates removal of the major oxidation product 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) in DNA,
and Mutyh initiates removal of adenine that has been misincorporated opposite
8-oxoG. Our data show that the onset of clinical signs appeared unaffected by
Mutyh and Ogg1 expression. However, the ogg1(-/-)mutyh(-/-) mice displayed a
significantly shorter clinical phase of the disease. Thus, accumulation of
oxidative DNA damage might be of particular importance in the terminal clinical
phase of prion disease. The prion-induced pathology and lesion profile were
similar between knockout mice and controls. The fragmentation pattern of
protease-resistant PrP as revealed in Western blots was also identical between
the groups. Our data show that the fundamentals of prion propagation and
pathological manifestation are not influenced by the oxidative DNA damage repair 
mechanisms studied here, but that progressive accumulation of oxidative lesions
may accelerate the final toxic phase of prion disease.
