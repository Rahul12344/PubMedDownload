BACKGROUND: Outcome prediction in patients with acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) greatly improves when patients are reclassified based on
predefined arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen ratios 
(PaO2/FiO2) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) cutoffs 24 h after the
initial ARDS diagnosis. The aim of this study was to test whether outcome
prediction improves when patients are reclassified based on predefined PaO2/FiO2 
and PEEP cutoffs 24 h after development of mild hypoxemia while not having ARDS.
METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a large prospective, multicenter, observational
study that ran in the ICUs of two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between
January 2011 and December 2013. Patients were classified into four groups using
predefined cutoffs for PaO2/FiO2 (250 mmHg) and PEEP (5 cm H2O), both at onset of
hypoxemia and after 24 h: PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 250 mmHg and PEEP < 6 cm H2O (group I),
PaO2/FiO2 ≥ 250 mmHg and PEEP ≥ 6 cm H2O (group II), PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mmHg and
PEEP < 6 cm H2O (group III), and PaO2/FiO2 < 250 mmHg and PEEP ≥ 6 cm H2O (group 
IV), to look for trend association with all-cause in-hospital mortality, the
primary outcome. Secondary outcome were ICU- and 90-day mortality, and the number
of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days and alive at day 28.
RESULTS: The analysis included 689 consecutive patients. All-cause in-hospital
mortality was 35%. There was minimal variation in mortality between the four
groups at onset of hypoxemia (33, 36, 38, and 34% in groups I to IV,
respectively; P = 0.65). Reclassification after 24 h resulted in a strong trend
with increasing mortality from group I to group IV (31, 31, 37, and 48% in groups
I to IV, respectively; P < 0.01). Similar trends were found for the secondary
endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Reclassification using PaO2/FiO2 and PEEP cutoffs after 24 h
improved classification for outcome in invasively ventilated ICU patients with
hypoxemia not explained by ARDS, compared to classification at onset of
hypoxemia.
