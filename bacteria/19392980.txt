PROBLEM: Chlamydia trachomatis causes sexually transmitted infection and
reproductive dysfunction worldwide. Identifying a population of endocervical
T-cells to target in vaccine development is likely to enhance efficacy of a
vaccine and reduce reproductive tract dysfunction.
METHOD OF STUDY: Endocervical samples were obtained from young women and flow
cytometric analysis was used to identify lymphocytes that appeared in the genital
tract in response to sexually transmitted bacterial infections caused by C.
trachomatis.
RESULTS: Increased numbers of α4β7+CLA+ memory T-cells, a unique T-cell
phenotype, were found in the endocervix of human female subjects infected with C.
trachomatis.
CONCLUSION: A unique population of memory T lymphocytes expressing both α4β7 and 
CLA gain access to reproductive tract tissues during a sexually transmitted
infection with C. trachomatis and should be considered in development of vaccines
against sexually transmitted infections.
