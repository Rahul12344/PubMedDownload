Sequence and copy number variations in the human CFHR-Factor H gene cluster
comprising the complement genes CFHR1, CFHR2, CFHR3, CFHR4, CFHR5, and Factor H
are linked to the human kidney diseases atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS)
and C3 glomerulopathy. Distinct genetic and chromosomal alterations, deletions,
or duplications generate hybrid or mutant CFHR genes, as well as hybrid
CFHR-Factor H genes, and alter the FHR and Factor H plasma repertoire. A clear
association between the genetic modifications and the pathologic outcome is
emerging: CFHR1, CFHR3, and Factor H gene alterations combined with intact CFHR2,
CFHR4, and CFHR5 genes are reported in atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. But
alterations in each of the five CFHR genes in the context of an intact Factor H
gene are described in C3 glomerulopathy. These genetic modifications influence
complement function and the interplay of the five FHR proteins with each other
and with Factor H. Understanding how mutant or hybrid FHR proteins, Factor H::FHR
hybrid proteins, and altered Factor H, FHR plasma profiles cause pathology is of 
high interest for diagnosis and therapy.
