OBJECTIVE: This is to investigate the implication of fluoroquinolone usage in
veterinary practice and the food chain system.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Five hundred isolates of commensal E coli were recovered
from the faeces of apparently healthy cattle in Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. The
susceptibility of the bacteria was tested using standard laboratory procedures.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to detect the presence of qnrA
and qnrB genes, which were selected on the basis of their
fluoroquinolone-resistant patterns.
RESULTS: The agar disc diffusion technique revealed that the representative
isolates showed multiple fluoroquinolone-resistance and this formed the basis for
their selection for PCR amplification. The PCR revealed that ten of the 17
quinolone-resistant representative isolates showed distinct bands which are
specific for the qnrB gene; in addition, only one strain of the 20 representative
isolates of commensal E coli carried plasmids on which the qnrA gene was
detected.
CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance
is a possible mechanism among the fluoroquinolone-resistant commensal E coli
isolated from faeces of apparently healthy cattle in the study location.
