OBJECTIVE: P. gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium and a major
periodontal pathogen. LPS produced by P. gingivalis promotes osteoclast
formation. TECK is a CC chemokine whose expression is increased in gingival
epithelial cells exposed to P. gingivalis LPS. In this study, we investigated the
effect of TECK in osteoclastogenesis induced by P. gingivalis LPS.
DESIGNS: Real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR)
analysis and western blotting were performed to confirm TECK in MG63, human
osteoblast cell line and primary murine osteoblasts and CCR9 in RAW 264.7 cells
and murine bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) as osteoclast precursors. P. gingivalis
LPS-treated BMMs and Raw 264.7 cells were cultured with or without TECK or TECK
antibody to examine the effect of TECK on osteoclast formation. Cocultures with
murine osteoblasts and bone marrow cells were also treated with or without TECK
or TECK antibody. Luciferase assay and western blotting were used to determine
whether TECK-CCR9 induced osteoclastogenesis was mediated through NFATc1 or NF-kB
signaling.
RESULTS: TECK was shown to be expressed by osteoblasts, and its receptor, CCR9,
by osteoclast precursors. TECK increased P. gingivalis LPS-induced osteoclast
numbers in an in vitro osteoclast formation assay using osteoclast precursors.
The enhanced osteoclast formation by TECK was mediated by NFATc1, but not by
NF-kB signaling.
CONCLUSION: TECK may be a novel regulator of osteoclast formation induced by P.
gingivalis LPS in periodontitis.
