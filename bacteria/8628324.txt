Water samples were collected from the river Ganga at Narora (U.P.). High
performance liquid chromatography analysis of water samples by the liquid
extraction procedure indicated the presence of several pesticides such as DDT,
alpha-BHC, aldrin, endrin and dieldrin at concentrations of 1.36, 1.38, 0.95,
0.61 and 0.41 ppb, respectively. The organophosphorus pesticides such as
dimethoate and methyl parathion also appear to be present at concentrations of
0.20 and 0.41 ppb, respectively. The XAD water concentrates and liquid-liquid
extracted water samples were assayed for mutagenic potential by the Ames
Salmonella/microsome test. The test samples exhibited a significant degree of
mutagenicity with TA102, TA100 and TA98 strains both in the presence and absence 
of DNA repair defective mutants, recA, lexA and polA of E. coli was observed as
compared to their wild-type counterpart in the presence of XAD water
concentrates.
