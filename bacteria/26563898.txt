Osteomyelitis is a serious infection predominantly caused by Gram-positive
bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
Orthopaedic device-related infections are complex and require a careful
combination of surgical intervention and antimicrobial therapy. Daptomycin, a
cyclic lipopeptide, effectively penetrates soft tissue and bone and demonstrates 
rapid concentration-dependent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive
pathogens. This retrospective, non-interventional study evaluated clinical
outcomes in patients with osteomyelitis or orthopaedic device infections treated 
with daptomycin from the European CubicinÂ® Outcomes Registry and Experience
(EU-CORE(SM)) study. Patients were treated between January 2006 and April 2012,
with follow-up to 2014. Clinical outcomes were assessed as success (cured or
improved), failure or non-evaluable. Of 6,075 patients enrolled, 638 (median age,
63.5 years) had primary infections of osteomyelitis or orthopaedic device
infections, 224 had non-prosthetic osteomyelitis, 208 had osteomyelitis related
to a permanent or temporary prosthetic device, and 206 had orthopaedic device
infections. The most commonly isolated pathogen was S. aureus (214 [49.1 %]; 24.8
% were MRSA). Overall, 455 (71.3 %) patients had received previous antibiotic
therapy. Patients underwent surgical interventions, including tissue (225 [35.3
%]) and bone (196 [30.7 %]) debridement, as part of their treatment. Clinical
success rates were 82.7 % and 81.7 % in S. aureus and coagulase-negative
staphylococcal infections. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs assessed as
possibly related to daptomycin were observed in 6.7 % and 1.9 % of patients,
respectively. Daptomycin was discontinued by 5.5 % of patients due to AEs and 10 
(1.6 %) deaths were reported. In conclusion, daptomycin was effective and safe in
patients with osteomyelitis or orthopaedic device infections.
