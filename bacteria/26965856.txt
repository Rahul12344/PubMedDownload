DNA-dependent RNA primase is essential for de novo primer synthesis during DNA
replication in all living organisms. Bacterial DnaG primase is an attractive
target for inhibition because it is essential, low in copy number and
structurally distinct from eukaryotic and archaeal primases. DnaG primase is
sensitive to known inhibitors including suramin and doxorubicin. Recently,
tilorone was discovered by high throughput screening to be an inhibitor of
Bacillus anthracis primase DnaG but it failed to reduce the growth of B.
anthracis in vitro. In this study we determined that tilorone also inhibited DnaG
primase from Staphylococcus aureus. C2-Symmetric fluorenone-based compounds,
similar to tilorone chemical structure were synthesized and tested to identify
potential lead compounds that inhibit bacterial growth in B. anthracis, MRSA and 
Burkholderia thailandensis. These compounds were evaluated by determining the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against several different bacterial
species which demonstrated 17.5 and 16 μg/ml MIC profiles. Importantly, some of
the fluorenone-based compounds with a long carbon chain showed a relatively low
MIC against B. anthracis, S. aureus, MRSA, Francisella tularensis, and B.
thailandensis, suggesting it may be a promising lead compound.
