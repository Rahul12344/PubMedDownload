BACKGROUND: A growing number of severe Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP)
cases have been reported recently. However, the pathogenesis of severe MPP is not
clear. In the current study, transcriptome sequencing was used to identify gene
expression and alternative splicing profiles to provide insights into the
pathogenesis of severe MPP.
METHODS: RNAs of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from three severe
MPP children and three mild MPP children were analyzed respectively by deep
sequencing followed by computational annotation and quantification.
RESULTS: The gene expression analysis revealed 14 up-regulated and 34
down-regulated genes in severe MPP children comparing to mild MPP children. The
top 10 most up-regulated genes were IGHV1-69, CH17-472G23.1, ATP1B2, FCER2,
MUC21, IL13, FCRLB, CLEC5A, FAM124A, and INHBA. The top 10 most down-regulated
genes were OSTN-AS1, IL22RA2, COL3A1, C1orf141, IGKV2-29, RP11-731F5.2, IGHV4-4, 
KIRREL, DNASE1L3, and COL6A2. Clustering analysis revealed similar expression
pattern of CLEC5A, IL13, FCER2, and FLT1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses revealed changes related to primary
immunodeficiency in severe MPP children comparing to mild MPP children; the
pathway involves CD19, TNFRSF13C, CD79A, and AICDA genes. Among the
differentially expressed genes, significant alternative splicing events were
found in FCER2 and FCRLA.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study on RNA sequencing provides novel insights into the
pathogenesis of severe MPP in terms of gene expression and alternative splicing. 
The up-regulation of IL13, FCER2, FLT1, and CLEC5A and the down-regulation of
CD79A, AICDA, CD19, and TNFRSF13C may contribute to the pathogenesis of severe
MPP. The differential expressions of FCER2 and FCRLA could be due to their
alternative splicing.
