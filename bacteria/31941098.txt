Lysozymes are key antimicrobial peptides in the host innate immune system that
protect against pathogen infection. In this study, the full-length cDNAs of two
c-type lysozymes (gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2) were cloned from goldfish (Carassius
auratus). The structural domains, three-dimensional structures, and amino acid
sequences of gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2 were highly comparable, as the two proteins
shared 89.7% sequence identity. The gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2 recombinant proteins
were generated in the insoluble fractions of an Escherichia coli system. Based on
the results of lysoplate and turbidimetric assays, gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2 showed
broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties with high levels of activity against
Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Vibrio parahemolyticus, and Edwardsiella tarda, and
relatively low activity against E. coli. Both gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2 mRNAs were
mainly expressed in the trunk kidney and head kidney, and gfLyz-C1 was expressed 
at much higher levels than gfLyz-C2 in the corresponding tissues. The expression 
of the gfLyz-C1 and gfLyz-C2 transcripts in the trunk kidney and head kidney was 
induced in these tissues by challenge with heat-inactivated E. coli and
lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and the transcriptional responses of gfLyz-C1 were
more intense. In goldfish primary trunk kidney cells, the levels of the gfLyz-C1 
and gfLyz-C2 transcripts were upregulated by heat-inactivated E. coli, V.
parahemolyticus, and E. tarda, as well as LPS, and downregulated by treatment
with dexamethasone and leptins. Overall, this study may provide new insights that
will improve our understanding of the roles of c-type lysozymes in the innate
immunity of cyprinid fish, including the structural and phylogenetic
characteristics, antimicrobial effects, and regulatory mechanism.
