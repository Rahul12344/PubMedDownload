The mammalian 70K protein, a component of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
involved in pre-mRNA splicing, interacts with a number of proteins important for 
regulating constitutive and alternative splicing. Similar proteins that interact 
with the yeast homolog of the 70K protein, Snp1p, have yet to be identified. We
used the two-hybrid system to find four U1-Snp1 associating (Usa) proteins. Two
of these proteins physically associate with Snp1p as assayed by
coimmunoprecipitation. One is Prp8p, a known, essential spliceosomal component.
This interaction suggests some novel functions for Snp1p and the U1 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein late in spliceosome development. The other, Exo84p, is a
conserved subunit of the exocyst, an eight-protein complex functioning in
secretion. We show here that Exo84p is also involved in pre-mRNA splicing. A
temperature-sensitive exo84 mutation caused increased ratios of pre-mRNA to mRNA 
for the Rpl30 and actin transcripts in cells incubated at the non-permissive
temperature. The mutation also led to a defect in splicing and prespliceosome
formation in vitro; an indication that Exo84p has a direct role in splicing. The 
results elucidate a surprising link between splicing and secretion.
