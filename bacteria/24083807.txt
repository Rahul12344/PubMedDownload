The present work deals with the optimization of an inhibitor of PqsD, an enzyme
essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing apparatus. Molecular docking 
studies, supported by biophysical methods (surface plasmon resonance, isothermal 
titration calorimetry, saturation transfer difference NMR), were used to
illuminate the binding mode of the 5-aryl-ureidothiophene-2-carboxylic acids.
Enabled to make profound predictions, structure-based optimization led to
increased inhibitory potency. Finally a covalent inhibitor was obtained. Binding 
to the active site was confirmed by LC-ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF-MS experiments.
Following this rational approach, potent PqsD inhibitors were efficiently
developed within a short period of time. This example shows that a combination
and careful application of in silico and biophysical methods represents a
powerful complement to cocrystallography.
