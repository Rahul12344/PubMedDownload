In cAMP-Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling, A-kinase anchoring protein scaffolds
assemble PKA in close proximity to phosphodiesterases (PDE), kinase-substrates to
form signaling islands or 'signalosomes'. In its basal state, inactive PKA
holoenzyme (R2:C2) is activated by binding of cAMP to regulatory (R)-subunits
leading to dissociation of active catalytic (C)-subunits. PDEs hydrolyze
cAMP-bound to the R-subunits to generate 5'-AMP for termination and resetting the
cAMP signaling. Mechanistic basis for cAMP signaling has been derived primarily
by focusing on the proteins in isolation. Here, we set out to simulate cAMP
signaling activation-termination cycles in a signalosome-like environment with
PDEs and PKA subunits in close proximity to each other. Using a combination of
fluorescence polarization and amide hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry with
regulatory (RIα), C-subunit (Cα) and PDE8 catalytic domain, we have tracked
movement of cAMP through activation-termination cycles. cAMP signaling operates
as a continuum of four phases: (1) Activation and dissociation of PKA into R- and
C-subunits by cAMP and facilitated by substrate (2) PDE recruitment to R-subunits
(3) Hydrolysis of cAMP to 5'-AMP (4) Reassociation of C-subunit to
5'-AMP-bound-RIα in the presence of excess ATP to reset cAMP signaling to form
the inactive PKA holoenzyme. Our results demonstrate that 5'-AMP is not merely a 
passive hydrolysis end-product of PDE action. A 'ligand-free' state R subunit
does not exist in signalosomes as previously assumed. Instead the R-subunit
toggles between cAMP- or 5'-AMP bound forms. This highlights, for the first time,
the importance of 5'-AMP in promoting adaptation and uncovers adenylate control
in cAMP signaling.
