The nonclassical class I molecule, thymic leukemia (TL), has been shown to be
expressed on intestinal epithelial cells and to interact with CD8(+)
intraepithelial T lymphocytes. We generated recombinant soluble TL (T18(d)) H
chains in bacteria as inclusion bodies and refolded them with
beta(2)-microglobulin in the presence or absence of a random peptide library.
Using a mAb, HD168, that recognizes a conformational epitope on native TL
molecules, we observed that protein folds efficiently in the absence of peptide. 
Circular dichroism analysis demonstrated that TL molecules have structural
features similar to classical class I molecules. Moreover, thermal denaturation
experiments indicated that the melting temperature for peptide-free TL is similar
to values reported previously for conventional class I-peptide complexes. Our
results also show that CD8alphaalpha binding is not dependent on either
TL-associated peptide or TL glycosylation.
