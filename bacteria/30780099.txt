Clostridium carboxidivorans produces alcohols from C1 gases (CO, CO2), converting
them first into fatty acids, and subsequently into alcohols. This research
identified conditions that allow to selectively produce either fatty acids or
alcohols. The conversion of gases into acids and then into alcohols is catalysed 
by metalloenzymes, stimulated by specific trace metals. Therefore, different
bioreactors were set-up, either with or without addition of tungsten (W) or
selenium (Se) and at different pHs. Combining the presence of those trace metals 
with a low pH (5.0) allowed to accumulate high amounts of alcohols as major end
products (8038 mg/L total alcohols; 3027 mg/L total acids). Instead, maintaining 
a higher pH (6.2), in the absence of those trace metals, allowed to selectively
produce organic acids (9577 mg/L) and almost no alcohols (676 mg/L). Omitting W, 
but not Se, at high pH (6.2), led to a still higher concentration of acids
(11303 mg/L).
