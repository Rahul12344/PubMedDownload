Bacterial shock responses.

Bacteria, very early in their history, developed protective 'shock responses',
triggered when the organism was exposed to some acute environmental stress. At
the heart of each response was the accelerated synthesis of both general and
stimulus-specified intracellular proteins. So successful was this strategy that
its basic mechanism and several of its components were highly conserved
throughout the course of evolution. This was particularly true of heat shock
proteins whose universal distribution has both good and bad consequences for man.
