To evaluated the feasibility of preventing infection after high dose chemotherapy
and radiotherapy using the granulocytes derived from differentiated from
hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo, human CD34-positive cells were
isolated from umbilical cord blood by using a high-gradient magnetic cell sorting
system (MACS), and the cells committedly differentiated with hematopoietic
cytokines (SCF + IL-3 + IL-6 + G-CSF) in a liquid culture system. The expanded
cell number, ratio of the viable cells, chromosome and phenotype of the
differentiated cells and safety analysis of expanded cells were detected by using
cell count, trypan blue exclusion test, karyotype analysis, flow cytometry and
tumorigenic model of nude mice, respectively. The results showed that the
combination of cytokines increased cell number by (1006.4 +/- 103.2) folds and
flow cytometric analysis showed myeloid marker CD11b expressed in the about 60%
cells. The growth peak of differentiated cells was at 14 days of culture and
decreased at about 33 days. No abnormality was found in the karyotype analysis of
expanded cells. No tumor was found in the nude mice injected with expanded cells 
after 35 days and the expanded cells had the ability of phagocytizing bacteria.
It is concluded that the cells, differentiated from CD34(+) cells, expanded ex
vivo possess the function of granulocyte and it was safe for clinical trial.
