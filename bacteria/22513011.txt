AtMAPR5/MSBP1 and its homologs can be ubiquitinated in the absence of E3 ligase
in in vitro ubiquitination assays. Ubiquitinated AtMAPR3, AtMAPR5/MSBP1, and
AtMAPR2 were identified using LC-MS/MS. Analysis of trypsin-released signature
peptides showed that this E3-independent ubiquitination of AtMAPR3,
AtMAPR5/MSBP1, and AtMAPR2 was dominated by mono-ubiquitination at multiple
sites. Unlike AtUBC8-type E2s, AtUBC36 was not able to transfer ubiquitin to
AtMAPR2. The truncated mutants AtMAPR2Δ1-10, AtMAPR2Δ1-30, and AtMAPR2_1-73 could
also be ubiquitinated. The presence of a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBD) allows
proteins to be ubiquitinated independently of E3 ligases. However, AtMAPRs do not
contain any known UBD. In vitro ubiquitination of AtMAPR2 observed in this study 
will be further studied in biochemical and physiological aspects.
