Relapsing fever, caused by spirochaetes belonging to the genus Borrelia, was once
the cause of worldwide epidemic zoonotic disease. This was largely through
infection with the louse-borne form of the disease, caused by Borrelia
recurrentis [(louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF)]. Another form of replasing
fever is caused by Borrelia duttonii [(tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF)]. The
introduction and the wide use of DDT in the last century, which is forbidden now,
the incidence and prevalence of both LBRF and TBRF markedly decreased. However,
with the increase of rapid transportation, crowdedness and poverty, as well as
abundance of lice and ticks, replasing fever is still endemic to some countries. 
Besides, with the appearance of others closely related Borrelia species that
begins to emerge, the threat or the burden of these arthropod-borne zoonotic may 
be unpredicted or underestimated.
