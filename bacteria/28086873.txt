BACKGROUND: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) is a food-borne pathogen
and of great threat to human health through consuming the contaminated poultry
products. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in different biological
activities and have been shown to regulate the innate immunity in the bacterial
infection. The objective of this study is to identify miRNAs associated with SE
infection in laying chicken cecum.
RESULTS: Average number of reads of three libraries constructed from infected and
non-infected chickens was 12,476,156 and 10,866,976, respectively. There were 598
miRNAs including 194 potential novel miRNAs identified in which 37 miRNAs were
significantly differentially expressed between infected and non-infected
chickens. In total, 2897 unique target genes regulated by differentially
expressed miRNAs were predicted, in which, 841 genes were uniquely regulated by
up-regulated miRNAs (G1), 636 genes were uniquely regulated by down-regulated
miRNAs (G2), and 1420 were co-regulated by both up and down- regulated miRNAs
(G3). There were 118, 73 and 178 GO (Gene ontology) BP (Biological process) terms
significantly enriched in G1, G2 and G3 groups, respectively. More immune-related
GO BP terms than metabolism-related terms were found in G1. Expression of 12
immune-related genes of four differentially expressed miRNAs was detected through
qRT-PCR. The regulatory direction of gga-miR-1416-5p, gga-miR-1662, and
gga-miR-34a-5p were opposite with the target genes of TLR21, BCL10, TLR1LA,
NOTCH2 and THBS1, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The miRNAs contribute to the response to SE infection at the onset of
egg laying through regulating the homeostasis between metabolism and immunity.
The gga-miR-125b-5p, gga-miR-34a-5p, gga-miR-1416-5p and gga-miR-1662 could play 
an important role in SE infection through regulating their target genes. The
finding herein will pave the foundation for the studies of microRNA regulation in
SE infection in laying hens.
