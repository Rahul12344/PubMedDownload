After specific activation, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) enter a refractory
state termed activation-induced nonresponsiveness (AINR) that is characterized by
the inability of T cells to respond to a secondary stimulus. Here, we show that T
cell receptor triggering results in rapid degradation of the src-family protein
kinase lck through a mechanism that is proteasome- and lysosome-independent,
sensitive to cysteine protease inhibitors, and distinct from the pathways
involved in degradation of ZAP-70 kinase or zeta-chain of the CD3 complex.
Pharmacologic blockade of lck degradation, as well as transfection of refractory 
cells with an lck expression vector, increased responsiveness of CTLs to repeated
antigenic challenge. The development or maintenance of AINR was not affected by
exogenously added IL-2, whereas IL-15 or IFN-alpha restored both lck expression
and responsiveness of preactivated CTLs. Our results suggest that lck degradation
plays an important role in the development of AINR in human CTLs and that this
condition can be reverted by pharmacologic agents or lymphokines that prevent lck
degradation or induce its expression.
