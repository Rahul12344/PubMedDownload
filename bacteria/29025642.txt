Titanium (Ti) implants have been commonly used in oral medicine. However, despite
their widespread clinical application, these implants are susceptible to failure 
induced by microbial infection due to bacterial biofilm formation. Immobilization
of chimeric peptides with antibacterial properties on the Ti surface may be a
promising antimicrobial approach to inhibit biofilm formation. Here, chimeric
peptides were designed by connecting three sequences (hBD-3-1/2/3) derived from
human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) with Ti-binding peptide-l (TBP-l: RKLPDAGPMHTW) via a 
triple glycine (G) linker to modify Ti surfaces. Using X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), the properties of individual domains of the chimeric peptides
were evaluated for their binding activity toward the Ti surface. The
antimicrobial and anti-biofilm efficacy of the peptides against initial settlers,
Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii) and
Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis), was evaluated with confocal laser
scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to
study cell membrane changes and the underlying antimicrobial mechanism. Compared 
with the other two peptides, TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3 presented stronger antibacterial
activity and remained stable in saliva and serum. Therefore, it was chosen as the
best candidate to modify Ti surfaces in this study. This peptide inhibited the
growth of initial streptococci and biofilm formation on Ti surfaces with no
cytotoxicity to MC3T3-E1 cells. Disruption of the integrity of bacterial
membranes and decreased expression of adhesion protein genes from S. gordonii
revealed aspects of the antibacterial mechanism of TBP-1-GGG-hBD3-3. We conclude 
that engineered chimeric peptides with antimicrobial activity provide a potential
solution for inhibiting biofilm formation on Ti surfaces to reduce or prevent the
occurrence of peri-implant diseases.
