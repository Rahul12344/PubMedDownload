BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate peripheral blood CD4+ T-helper (Th)
and CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to combination treatment with
interferon (IFN) alpha and ribavirin in 59 patients with chronic hepatitis C, and
to correlate the results with the therapy outcome.
METHODS: The expression of activation molecules on the surface of CD8+ T cells
and cytokine production by in-vitro activated CTLs and Th lymphocytes were
examined before and at the end of the therapy, using flow cytometry.
RESULTS: There were 36 complete responders to the treatment and 23 transient
responders who relapsed after withdrawal of the therapy. A significant increase
in the production of Th1-type cytokines [IFNgamma, interleukin 2 (IL2), and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)] was found at the end of the treatment in
complete responders compared with baseline values (P < 0.001). In contrast,
transient responders had a marked decrease in the percentage of activated CD8+ T 
cells expressing CD28 or HLA-DR costimulatory molecules in peripheral blood, and 
a lower production of TNFalpha by CTLs and Th cells at the end of the therapy
with respect to pretreatment values (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of IFNalpha and ribavirin combination therapy for
chronic hepatitis C is associated with a vigorous response of peripheral blood
Th1 cells, whereas weak CTL responses at the end of the therapy might predict a
further relapse of the disease.
