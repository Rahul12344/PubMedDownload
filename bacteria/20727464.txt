Stool culture for enteric pathogens is one of the most labor-intensive clinical
microbiology procedures. Direct plating of stool to BBL CHROMagar Salmonella
(CHROMSal) (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD) versus subculture after selenite broth
enrichment (Sel) to CHROMSal (Sel-CHROMSal) and Hektoen enteric agar (Sel-Hek)
(PML Microbiologicals, Eugene, OR) to detect Salmonella were compared. The number
of colony picks and biochemical/serotyping tests per plate was recorded. A cost
comparison was done. Fifty-one of 2999 (1.7%) stools yielded Salmonella sp., and 
80% of isolates grew on CHROMSal by 24 h. CHROMSal demonstrated much less
false-positive growth compared to Sel-Hek (P < 0.0001), which reduced biochemical
and serotyping tests by 85% and 20%, respectively. Sel-CHROMSal and CHROMSal
versus Sel-Hek improved enteric Salmonella detection when compared to a true
positive "gold standard" (i.e., recovery by any culture method) with a
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
value of 100% and 94.12%, 100% and 99.97%, 100% and 97.96%, and 100% and 99.90%, 
respectively. CHROMSal use would result in substantial cost and labor savings.
