Some new five coordinated ZnLX2 complexes, where L is N3-Schiff base ligand
obtained by condensation reaction between diethylenetriamine and
(E)-3-(2-nitrophenyl)acrylaldehyde and X (Cl(-), Br(-), I(-), N3(-) and NCS(-)), 
were synthesized and characterized by FT-IR, (1)H and (13)CNMR, UV-visible,
ESI-mass spectra and molar conductivity measurements. The structures of zinc
iodide and thiocyanate complexes were determined by X-ray crystallographic
analysis. The X-ray results showed that the Zn (II) center in these complexes is 
five-coordinated in a distorted trigonal-bipyramidal configuration. Zinc iodide
and thiocyanate complexes crystallize in the monoclinic and triclinic systems
with space groups of C2/c and P1- with eight and two molecules per unit cell
respectively. The crystal packing of the complexes consists of intermolecular
interactions such as C-H(…)O and C-H(…)I, C-H(···)S, N(…)O, together with π-π
stacking and some other unexpected interactions. The mentioned interactions cause
three-dimensional supramolecular structure in the solid state. Zinc complexes
were also prepared in nano-structure by sonochemical method confirmed by XRD, SEM
and TEM analyses. Moreover, ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized by direct
thermolysis of zinc iodide complex. Furthermore, antimicrobial and thermal
properties of the compounds were completely investigated.
