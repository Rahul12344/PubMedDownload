Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induces hyperproliferation of the gastric mucosa.
This study was designed to clarify whether H. pylori infection is involved in the
gene expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a potent stimulator of cell
proliferation in gastric mucosa. Levels of HGF mRNA were determined by a reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction in endoscopic gastric biopsy specimens
from 9 control subjects and 9 patients with H. pylori infection. In patients with
H. pylori infection, levels of HGF mRNA in gastric mucosa were significantly
higher than those in control subjects. HGF mRNA levels in patients with H. pylori
infection were correlated with the severity of gastric mucosal inflammation. Our 
observations indicate that H. pylori infection increases the expression of HGF
gene in gastric mucosa probably through the mucosal inflammation.
