Temporal changes in the distribution of exogenous HCB and DDT among different
soil organic matter fractions were studied under sterile and non-sterile
conditions, different soil water contents, and different concentrations of added 
Cu(2+). The residence time was 311days. Soil organic matter was fractionated into
fulvic acid (FA), humic acid (HA), bound-humic acid (BHA), lipid, and insoluble
residue (IR) fractions by a methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) method. Results
revealed that there is a mass transfer tendency of DDT and HCB from FA, HA and
BHA to IR and lipid fractions with increasing residence time. Microbial activity 
accelerated the mass transfer, while the addition of Cu(2+) slowed it down. The
HCB and DDT transfer rate decreased as the soil moisture increased from 1.9% to
60%, but increased when soil moisture increased further to 90%. A two-compartment
first order kinetic model was used to describe the mass transfer from FA, HA and 
BHA.
