The worldwide spread of beta-lactamases with hydrolytic activity extended to last
resort carbapenems is aggravating the antibiotic resistance problem and endangers
the successful antimicrobial treatment of clinically relevant pathogens. As
recently highlighted by the World Health Organization, new strategies to contain 
antimicrobial resistance are urgently needed. Class A carbapenemases include
members of the KPC, GES and SFC families. These enzymes have the ability to
hydrolyse penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, while also being less
susceptible to available beta-lactam inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. The KPC
family is the most prevalent. It is mostly found on plasmids in Klebsiella
pneumoniae, meaning that great amounts of attention, in terms of inhibitor design
and structural biology, have been dedicated to it, whereas no efforts have yet
been dedicated to GES-type enzymes, despite their ability to rapidly and
horizontally disseminate. We herein report the first in silico screening against 
GES-5, which is the most dangerous GES-type beta-lactamase, using a library of
800K commercially available candidates that all share drug-like properties, such 
as their MW, logP, rotatable bonds and HBA/HBD atoms. The best screening results 
were filtered to enrich the number of different chemotypes, and then submitted to
molecular docking. The 34 most promising candidates were selected for in vitro
validation in biochemical assays against recombinant GES-5. Six hits acted as
inhibitors, in the high micromolar range, towards GES-5 and led to the
identification of the first, novel chemotypes with inhibitory activity against
this clinically relevant carbapenemase.
