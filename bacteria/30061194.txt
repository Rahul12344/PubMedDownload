BACKGROUND: The impact of antimicrobial resistance on clinical outcomes in
patients with lower respiratory tract infection in primary care is largely
unknown.
AIM: To determine the illness course of infections with resistant bacteria in
adults presenting to primary care with acute cough.
DESIGN AND SETTING: Secondary analysis of a multicentre European trial in primary
care.
METHOD: A total of 2061 adults with acute cough (lasting ≤28 days) were recruited
from primary care and randomised to amoxicillin or placebo. To reflect the
natural course of disease, only patients in the placebo group (n = 1021) were
eligible. Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs and/or sputa (when available) were
analysed at baseline and Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae
isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Patients recorded their symptoms in a 
diary every day for 4 weeks. Patients with and without resistant bacterial
infection were compared with regards to symptom severity, duration of symptoms,
worsening of illness, and duration of interference with normal activities or
work.
RESULTS: Of the 834 patients with diary records, 104 showed S. pneumoniae and/or 
H. influenzae infection. Of this number, 54 (52%) were resistant to antibiotics, 
while seven (7%) were resistant to penicillin. For the duration of symptoms rated
'moderately bad or worse' (hazard ratio 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67
to 2.44), mean symptom severity (difference -0.48, 95% CI = -1.17 to 0.21), and
worsening of illness (odds ratio 0.31, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.41), there was no
statistically significant difference between the antibiotic-resistant and
antibiotic-sensitive groups.
CONCLUSION: The illness course of antibiotic-resistant lower respiratory tract
infection does not differ from that caused by antibiotic-sensitive bacteria.
