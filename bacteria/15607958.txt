A subset of human cancer syndromes result from inherited defects in genes
responsible for DNA repair. During the past few years, discoveries concerning the
intersection of certain DNA repair processes have increased our understanding of 
how the disruption of specific DNA repair mechanisms leads to genomic instability
and tumorigenesis. This review focuses on the human genes MUTYH, BRCA2/FANCD1,
and BLM.
