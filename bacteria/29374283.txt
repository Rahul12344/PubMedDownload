Decreased levels of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) have 
previously been reported and have been linked to the increased susceptibility to 
skin infections found in AD patients. This study intents to identify AMPs: hBD-2,
hBD-3, RNase7, psoriasin and LL-37 in AD patients and healthy controls, and
determine concentrations in consecutive depths of the outer most skin layers.
Tape stripping was used on lesional and non-lesional skin. From each skin site,
35 consecutive tape strips were collected and pooled in groups of 5. Commercially
available ELISA kits were used to determine AMP concentration in stratum corneum 
samples. hBD-2, hBD-3, RNase7 and psoriasin were identified in stratum corneum
samples. hBD-3-level was markedly higher in AD non-lesional skin compared to
healthy controls, and a similar trend was observed for RNase7. Most AMPs were
distributed evenly through 35 tape strips, implying a homogeneous distribution of
antimicrobial defense in the outer most skin layers. The findings indicate that
AD patients may not suffer from a general baseline deficiency in AMPs, and that
the innate immune defense is present throughout the stratum corneum, both
insights of importance for understanding the role of AMPs in AD.
