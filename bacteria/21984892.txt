BACKGROUND: In addition to its complement-regulating activity, CD55 is a ligand
of the adhesion class G protein-coupled receptor CD97; however, the relevance of 
this interaction has remained elusive. We previously showed that mice lacking a
functional CD97 gene have increased numbers of granulocytes.
METHODOLOGY/RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate that CD55-deficient mice display a
comparable phenotype with about two-fold more circulating granulocytes in the
blood stream, the marginated pool, and the spleen. This granulocytosis was
independent of increased complement activity. Augmented numbers of Gr-1-positive 
cells in cell cycle in the bone marrow indicated a higher granulopoietic activity
in mice lacking either CD55 or CD97. Concomitant with the increase in blood
granulocyte numbers, Cd55⁻/⁻ mice challenged with the respiratory pathogen
Streptococcus pneumoniae developed less bacteremia and died later after
infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that complement-independent
interaction of CD55 with CD97 is functionally relevant and involved in
granulocyte homeostasis and host defense.
