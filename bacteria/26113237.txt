PURPOSE: The aim of this work was to develop clarithromycin microparticles
(CLARI-MP) and evaluate their aerodynamic behavior, safety in bronchial cells and
anti-bacterial efficacy.
METHODS: Microparticles containing clarithromycin were prepared as dry powder
carrier for inhalation, using leucine and chitosan. CLARI-MP were deposited on
Calu-3 grown at air-interface condition, using the pharmaceutical aerosol
deposition device on cell cultures (PADDOCC). Deposition efficacy, transport
across the cells and cytotoxicity were determined. Anti-antibacterial effect was 
evaluated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus
aureus.
RESULTS: Microparticles were of spherical shape, smooth surface and size of about
765 nm. Aerosolization performance showed a fine particle fraction (FPF) of
73.3%, and a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.8 μm. Deposition on
Calu-3 cells using the PADDOCC showed that 8.7 μg/cm(2) of deposited powder were 
transported to the basolateral compartment after 24 h. The safety of this
formulation is supported by the integrity of the cellular epithelial barrier and 
absence of toxicity, and the antimicrobial activity demonstrated for Gram
positive and Gram negative bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate aerodynamic properties and the excellent deposition 
on Calu-3 cells indicate that clarithromycin microparticles are suitable for
administration via pulmonary route and are efficient to inhibit bacteria
proliferation.
