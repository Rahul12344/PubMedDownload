[Residues of chlorinated hydrocarbons in milk and milk products - situation and
evaluation (author's transl)].

[Article in German]

Heeschen W, Bl√ºthgen A, Tolle A.

Residues of the most varied chemical substances can be found in milk and in milk 
products. For the transfer into milk such factors as fat solubility, persistance 
with respect to metabolic processes and accumulation capacity in certain organic 
systems are of particular importance. For the description of the situation with
respect to residues of chlorinated insectides the results of analyses obtained in
20 supply areas of the German Federal Republic are presented and interpreted. In 
1974 the following mean values were found (fat basis): alpha-HCH 0.04, gamma-HCH 
0.072, heptachloro-epoxide 0.024, dieldrin 0.021 and DDT 0.20 ppm. These mean
values are far below the max. quantities legally permissible and in no way
constitute a toxicological risk (referred to ADI). In the German Federal Republic
the concentrations of hexachlorobenzene in some cases reach the permissible max. 
quantity of 0.5 ppm on a fat basis. There is reason to assume that this substance
finds its way into the milk not only via its application as a fungicide but
probably also via a number of other, in part unknown, sources of contamination in
or on vegetable products. With PCB (polychlorinated biphenyls) average
concentrations from 0.2 to 0.3 ppm must be expected to be present in milk and
milk products (fat basis). At present a toxicological interpretation of the
values found is hardly possible.
