The traditional Chinese medicine Chan-Su is widely used for treatment of cancer
and cardiovascular diseases, but also as a remedy for infections such as
furunculosis, tonsillitis and acute pharyngitis. The clinical use of Chan-Su
suggests that it has anti-infective effects, however, the mechanism of action is 
incompletely understood. In particular, the effect on the human immune system is 
poorly defined. Here, we describe previously unrecognized immunomodulatory
activities of cinobufagin (CBG), a major bioactive component of Chan-Su. Using
human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), we show that LPS-induced maturation
and production of a number of cytokines was potently inhibited by CBG, which also
had a pro-apoptotic effect, associated with activation of caspase-3.
Interestingly, CBG triggered caspase-1 activation and significantly enhanced
IL-1β production in LPS-stimulated cells. Finally, we demonstrate that CBG
upregulates gene expression of the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hBD-2 and hBD-3 
in DCs, and induces secretion of HNP1-3 and hCAP-18/LL-37 from neutrophils,
potentiating neutrophil antibacterial activity. Taken together, our data indicate
that CBG modulates the inflammatory phenotype of DCs in response to LPS, and
triggers an antibacterial innate immune response, thus proposing possible
mechanisms for the clinical effects of Chan-Su in anti-infective therapy.
