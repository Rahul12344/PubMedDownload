Infection of human urethral epithelium with Neisseria gonorrhoeae elicits an
upregulation of host anti-apoptotic factors and protects cells from
staurosporine-induced apoptosis.

In order to better understand the host response to an infection with Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, microarray technology was used to analyse the gene expression
profile between uninfected and infected human urethral epithelium. The
anti-apoptotic genes bfl-1, cox-2 and c-IAP-2 were identified to be upregulated
approximately eight-, four- or twofold, respectively, following infection.
Subsequent assays including RT-PCR, real time RT-PCR and RNase protection
confirmed the increased expression of these apoptotic regulators, and identified 
that a fourth anti-apoptotic factor, mcl-1, is also upregulated. RT-PCR and RNase
protection also showed that key pro-apoptotic factors including bax, bad and bak 
do not change in expression. Furthermore, our studies demonstrated that infection
with the gonococcus partially protects urethral epithelium from apoptosis induced
by the protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine (STS). This work shows that
following infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, several host anti-apoptotic
factors are upregulated. In addition, a gonococcal infection protects host cells 
from subsequent STS-induced death. The regulation of host cell death by the
gonococcus may represent a mechanism employed by this pathogen to survive and
proliferate in host epithelium.
