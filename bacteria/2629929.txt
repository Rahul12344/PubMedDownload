Mucormycosis is unusual in ORL pathology. We present a case of a 53-year-old
patient in the dialysis program for the past 6 years for renal insufficiency.
Starting with some trouble in the left lacrimal region, he was diagnosed by his
ophthalmologist as having deep dacryocystitis, appearing as an ulcero-necrotic
lesion on the same side of the nasal dorsum. In the presumption of clinical
mucormycosis, a microbiological and histological study was done to confirm the
diagnosis, starting treatment with amphotericin B. Because of the rapid extension
of the lesion, surgical debridement of the zone was done but his evolution was
bad, lapsing into a coma and requiring a neurosurgical operation for intracranial
complications. The patient died 12 days after admission. For that reason we did
an evaluation of the problem and also a review of the literature.
