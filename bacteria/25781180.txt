Mitochondrial inner membrane folds into cristae, which significantly increase its
surface and are important for mitochondrial function. The stability of cristae
depends on the mitochondrial contact site (MICOS) complex. In human mitochondria,
the inner membrane MICOS complex interacts with the outer membrane sorting and
assembly machinery (SAM) complex, to form the mitochondrial intermembrane space
bridging complex (MIB). We have created knockdown cell lines of most of the MICOS
and MIB components and have used them to study the importance of the individual
subunits for the cristae formation and complex stability. We show that the most
important subunits of the MIB complex in human mitochondria are Mic60/Mitofilin, 
Mic19/CHCHD3 and an outer membrane component Sam50. We provide additional proof
that ApoO indeed is a subunit of the MICOS and MIB complexes and propose the name
Mic23 for this protein. According to our results, Mic25/CHCHD6, Mic27/ApoOL and
Mic23/ApoO appear to be periphery subunits of the MICOS complex, because their
depletion does not affect cristae morphology or stability of other components.
