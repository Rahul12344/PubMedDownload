The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum causes a spectrum of disease, ranging 
from local pulmonary infection to disseminated disease. The organism seeks
residence in macrophages, which are permissive for its survival.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), a principal regulator of innate immunity to
pathogens, is necessary for macrophage-mediated immunity to H. capsulatum in
mice. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of HIF-1α in human macrophages
infected with this fungus. HIF-1α stabilization was detected in peripheral blood 
monocyte-derived macrophages at 2 to 24 h after infection with viable yeast
cells. Further, host mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were enhanced. In
contrast, heat-killed yeasts induced early, but not later, stabilization of
HIF-1α. Since the absence of HIF-1α is detrimental to host control of infection, 
we asked if large amounts of HIF-1α protein, exceeding those induced by H.
capsulatum, altered macrophage responses to this pathogen. Exposure of infected
macrophages to an HIF-1α stabilizer significantly reduced recovery of H.
capsulatum from macrophages and produced a decrement in mitochondrial respiration
and glycolysis compared to those of controls. We observed recruitment of the
autophagy-related protein LC3-II to the phagosome, whereas enhancing HIF-1α
reduced phagosomal decoration. This finding suggested that H. capsulatum
exploited an autophagic process to survive. In support of this assertion,
inhibition of autophagy activated macrophages to limit intracellular growth of H.
capsulatum Thus, enhancement of HIF-1α creates a hostile environment for yeast
cells in human macrophages by interrupting the ability of the pathogen to provoke
host cell autophagy.
