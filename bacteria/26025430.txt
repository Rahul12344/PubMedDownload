The objective of the study was to elucidate the biotic and abiotic processes
under dissimilatory iron reducing conditions involved in reductive dechlorination
and iron reduction. DDT transformation was investigated in cultures of Shewanella
putrefaciens 200 with/without α-FeOOH. A modified first-order kinetics model was 
developed and described DDT transformation well. Both the α-FeOOH reduction rate 
and the dechlorination rate of DDT were positively correlated to the biomass.
Addition of α-FeOOH enhanced reductive dechlorination of DDT by favoring the cell
survival and generating Fe(II) which was absorbed on the surface of bacteria and 
iron oxide. 92% of the absorbed Fe(II) was Na-acetate (1M) extractable. However, 
α-FeOOH also played a negative role of competing for electrons as reflected by
the dechlorination rate of DDT was inhibited when increasing the α-FeOOH from 1 g
L(-1) to 5 g L(-1). DDT was measured to be toxic to S. putrefaciens 200. The
metabolites DDD, DDE and DDMU were recalcitrant to S. putrefaciens 200. The
results suggested that iron oxide was not the key factor to promote the
dissipation of DDX (DDT and the metabolites), whereas the one-electron reduction 
potential (E1) of certain organochlorines is the main factor and that the E1
higher than the threshold of the reductive driving forces of DIRB probably
ensures the occur of reductive dechlorination.
