INTRODUCTION: There is some controversy about the effect of enamel matrix
derivative (EMD) on inflammation and resorption. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of EMD on the inflammatory response of monocytes and their
phagocytic activity in vitro.
METHODS: Human monocytes were incubated in complete medium (CM) and exposed to
50, 100, and 200 microg/mL EMD for different time points (12, 24, 48, and 72
hours). Untreated monocytes were considered as controls. Cellular viability was
evaluated through a 3-(4, 5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2, 5-diphenyl-2 tetrazolium
bromide assay. For cytokine measurements, the cells were treated simultaneously
with 50, 100, or 200 microg/mL EMD and 10 microg/mL Escherichia coli
lipopolysaccharide. Cell-free supernatants were collected after 12, 24, 48, and
72 hours of incubation. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and
interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) concentrations were measured by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kit. Phagocytic activity of the cells was assayed using the
PHAGOTEST kit (Glycotope Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
RESULTS: The viability of cells exposed to 50, 100, and 200 microg/mL EMD for 12,
24, 48, and 72 hours were similar to the controls. There was no significant
differences in the production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta among samples with
various concentrations (50, 100, and 200 microg/mL) of EMD and control (EMD = 0) 
at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Phagocytic activity of monocytic cells increased
significantly after 72 hours compared with 12 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, EMD does not promote releasing
of the two studied proinflammatory and resorbing cytokines, TNF-alpha and
IL-1beta. By increasing the phagocytic activity of monocytic cells, EMD might
accelerate wound healing.
