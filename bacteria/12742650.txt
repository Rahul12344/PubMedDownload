To determine the role of endogenous interleukin-18 (IL-18) in pneumococcal
meningitis, meningitis was induced in IL-18 gene-deficient (IL-18(-/-)) and
wild-type (WT) mice by intranasal inoculation of Streptococcus pneumoniae with
hyaluronidase. Induction of meningitis resulted in an upregulation of both pro-
and mature IL-18 in brain tissue in WT mice. IL-18(-/-) and WT mice were equally 
susceptible to develop meningitis after intranasal infection, yet IL-18(-/-) mice
showed a prolonged survival and a suppressed inflammatory response, as reflected 
by a less profound inflammatory infiltrate around the meninges and lower
concentrations of cytokines and chemokines in brain tissue. These findings
suggest that endogenous IL-18 contributes to a detrimental inflammatory response 
during pneumococcal meningitis and that elimination of IL-18 may improve the
outcome of this disease.
