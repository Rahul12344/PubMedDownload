This range-finding study determined the optimum concentration of copper sulfate
(CuSO4) for fungus control on eggs of channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus. The
study consisted of five CuSO4 concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg/L) and an
untreated control in a flow-through system. A single spawn was used for each
replication (N=4). Eggs were treated daily until the embryos reached the eyed
stage. When hatching was complete for all viable eggs, fry were counted to
determine the percent survival in each treatment. Fungal growth was severe in the
untreated controls; survival of hatched fry in the control group was
approximately 2%. The optimum CuSO4 treatment, as determined by percent survival 
of hatched fry, was 10 mg/L daily (69% survival); survival for this treatment
group was significantly different from that for the controls. Very little fungus 
was present in treatments receiving 10-mg/L CuSO4 or higher except in one
replication that had approximately 40% unfertilized eggs. The average survival
rates in the 0-, 2.5-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 40-mg/L CuSO4 treatments were 2, 34, 50,
69, 59, and 51%, respectively.
