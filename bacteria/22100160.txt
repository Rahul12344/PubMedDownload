iNKT cells are innate T lymphocytes recognizing endogenous and foreign lipid
antigens presented in the MHC-like molecule CD1d. The semi-invariant iNKT cell
TCR can detect certain bacterial and parasitic lipids and drive iNKT cell
responses. How iNKT cells respond to fungi, however, is unknown. We found that
CD1d-deficient mice, which lack iNKT cells, poorly control infection with the
fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, A. fumigatus rapidly
activates iNKT cells in vivo and in vitro in the presence of APCs. Surprisingly, 
despite a requirement for CD1d recognition, the antifungal iNKT cell response
does not require fungal lipids. Instead, Dectin-1- and MyD88-mediated responses
to β-1,3 glucans, major fungal cell-wall polysaccharides, trigger IL-12
production by APCs that drives self-reactive iNKT cells to secrete IFN-γ. Innate 
recognition of β-1,3 glucans also drives iNKT cell responses against Candida,
Histoplasma, and Alternaria, suggesting that this mechanism may broadly define
the basis for antifungal iNKT cell responses.
