Lymphomas cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. A substantial
number of patients ultimately relapse after standard treatment. However, the
efficacy of these therapies can be counteracted by the patients' immune system,
more specifically by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). MDSC are a
heterogeneous group of immature myeloid cells that suppress the innate and
adaptive immune system via different mechanisms and accumulate under pathological
conditions, such as cancer. MDSC play a role in the induction and progression of 
cancer and immune evasion. Increased numbers of MDSC have been reported in
different lymphoma subtypes and are associated with a poor clinical outcome. This
review aims to clarify the role of MDSC and their working mechanism in different 
lymphoma subtypes. Furthermore, the effect of MDSC on immunotherapies will be
discussed.
