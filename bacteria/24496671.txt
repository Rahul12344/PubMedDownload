Oval cells have a potential to differentiate into a variety of cell lineages
including hepatocytes and biliary epithelia. Several models have been established
to activate the oval cells by incorporating a variety of toxins and carcinogens, 
alone or combined with surgical treatment. Those models are obviously not
suitable for the study on human hepatic oval cells. It is necessary to establish 
a new and efficient model to study the human hepatic oval cells. In this study,
the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were used to
induce differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into hepatic oval
cells. We first confirmed that hepatic oval cells derived from ES cells, which
are bipotential, do exist during the course of mouse ES cells' differentiation
into hepatic parenchymal cells. RT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy were 
applied in this study. The ratio of Sca-1+/CD34+ cells sorted by FACS in the
induction group was increased from day 4 and reached the maximum on the day 8,
whereas that in the control group remained at a low level. The differentiation
ratio of Sca-1+/CD34+ cells in the induction group was significantly higher than 
that in the control group. About 92.48% of the sorted Sca-1+/CD34+ cells on the
day 8 were A6 positive. Highly purified A6+/Sca-1+/CD34+ hepatic oval cells
derived from ES cells could be obtained by FACS. The differentiation ratio of
hepatic oval cells in the induction group (up to 4.46%) was significantly higher 
than that in the control group. The number of hepatic oval cells could be
increased significantly by HGF and EGF. The study also examined the
ultrastructures of ES-derived hepatic oval cells' membrane surface by atomic
force microscopy. The ES-derived hepatic oval cells cultured and sorted by our
protocols may be available for the future clinical application.
