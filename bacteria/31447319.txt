Human CD141+ dendritic cells (DCs), specialized for cross-presentation, have been
extensively studied in the development of DC-based therapy against cancer. A
series of attempts was made to generate CD141+ DCs from cord blood CD34+
hematopoietic progenitors to overcome the practical limitation of in vivo
rareness. In the present study, we identified a culture system that generates
high CD141+ DCs. After culture of CD14+ monocytes in the presence of granulocyte 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin (IL)-4 for 8 days, 
CD141 was detected on cells that adhered to the bottom of the culture plate. The 
attached cells exhibited typical features of immature monocyte-derived DCs
(moDCs), except for higher CD86 expression, more dendrites and higher granularity
compared with those that did not attach. With 3 additional days of culture,
increased CD141 expression on the cells was retained along with adhesion ability 
and partial expression of CLEC9A, a c-type lectin receptor. Furthermore, the
cells exhibited effective uptake of dead cells. Interestingly, the attached moDCs
differently responded to polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) stimulation
as well as a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Collectively, our findings show that
human CD141+ DCs can be sufficiently generated from peripheral blood CD14+
monocytes, potentiating further investigation into generation of higher yields of
cross-priming human DCs in vitro.
