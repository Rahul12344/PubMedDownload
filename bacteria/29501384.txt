Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare genetic condition primarily caused by
hepatic ABCC6 transporter dysfunction. Most clinical manifestations of PXE are
due to premature calcification of elastic fibers. However, the vascular impact of
PXE is pleiotropic and remains ill defined. ABCC6 expression has recently been
associated with cellular nucleotide export. We studied the impact of ABCC6
deficiency on blood levels of adenosine triphosphate and related metabolites and 
on soluble nucleotidase activities in PXE patients and Abcc6-/- mice. In
addition, we investigated the expression of genes encoding ectocellular
purinergic signaling proteins in mouse liver and aorta. Plasma adenosine
triphosphate and pyrophosphate levels were significantly reduced in PXE patients 
and in Abcc6-/- mice, whereas adenosine concentration was not modified. Moreover,
5'-nucleotidase/CD73 activity was increased in the serum of PXE patients and
Abcc6-/- mice. Consistent with alterations of purinergic signaling, the
expression of genes involved in purine and phosphate transport/metabolism was
dramatically modified in Abcc6-/- mouse aorta, with much less impact on the
liver. ABCC6 deficiency causes impaired vascular homeostasis and tissue
perfusion. Our findings suggest that these alterations are linked to changes in
extracellular nucleotide metabolism that are remote from the liver. This opens
new perspectives for the understanding of PXE pathophysiology.
