Isolation of 57Co-cobalamin coenzymes at high specific activity from Streptomyces
griseus.

Quadros EV, Hamilton A, Matthews DM, Linnell JC.

The distribution of radio-labelled cobalamins in Streptomyces griseus grown in
medium containing 57Co-cobalt chloride has been estimated by two-dimensional
thin-layer chromatography and bioautography. 57Co-Methylocobalamin (Me[57Co]Cbl) 
was the major form in the mycelium together with smaller amounts of
57Co-adenosylcobalamin (Ado[57Co]Cbl) and 57Co-hydroxocobalamin (OH[57Co]Cbl).
The OH[57Co]Cbl was detected in three forms having, respectively, anionic,
cationic and neutral properties. A simple technique has been developed to isolate
and purify Me[57Co]Cbl and Ado[57Co]Cbl from the mycelium using column
chromatography on ion-exchange celluloses. Small quantities of each cobalamin
coenzyme have been obtained at 90--96% purity and specific activities of 190--230
muCi/microgram.
