Preclinical research shows that stress-induced activation of the sympathetic
nervous system can promote hematopoietic malignancies via
β-adrenoreceptor-mediated molecular pathways. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)
recipients exposed to conditions of chronic stress show activation of a conserved
transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA) gene expression profile, which in
turn is associated with increased relapse and decreased disease-free survival. We
conducted a randomized controlled phase 2 biomarker trial testing the impact of
the nonselective β-antagonist propranolol on CTRA-related gene expression of 25
individuals receiving an autologous HCT for multiple myeloma. Propranolol was
administered for 1 week prior to and 4 weeks following HCT. Blood was collected
at baseline, day -2, and day +28. Intention-to-treat analyses controlling for
demographic characteristics, high-risk disease (International Myeloma Working
Group risk score), and tumor stage tested effects on a 53-gene CTRA indicator
profile and measures of CTRA-related cellular processes in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells. Twelve participants were randomized to the intervention and 13
to the control. Relative to the control group, propranolol-treated patients
showed greater decreases from baseline to HCT day -2 and day +28 for both CTRA
gene expression (P = .017) and bioinformatic measures of CD16- classical monocyte
activation (P = .005). Propranolol-treated patients also showed relative
upregulation of CD34+ cell-associated gene transcripts (P = .011) and relative
downregulation of myeloid progenitor-containing CD33+ cell-associated gene
transcripts (P = .001). Ancillary analyses identified nonsignificant trends
toward accelerated engraftment and reduced posttransplant infections in
propranolol-treated patients. Peri-HCT propranolol inhibits cellular and
molecular pathways associated with adverse outcomes. Changes in these pathways
make propranolol a potential candidate for adjunctive therapy in cancer-related
HCT.
