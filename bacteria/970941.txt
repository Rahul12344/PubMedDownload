Metabolism of DDT analogues by a Pseudomonas sp.

Francis AJ, Spanggord RJ, Ouchi GI, Bramhall R, Bohonos N.

A Pseudomonas sp. rapidly metabolized several nonchlorinated analogues of DDT,
with the exception of 2,2-diphenylethanol, as the sole carbon source. Several of 
the mono-p-chloro-substituted diphenyl analogues were also metabolized as the
sole carbon source by the bacterium. The resulting chlorinated aromatic acid
metabolites were not further metabolized. The isolate was unable to metabolize
p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl analogues as the sole carbon source.
