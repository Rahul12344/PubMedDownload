Terpenoids have an essential function in present-day cellular membranes, either
as membrane reinforcers in Eucarya and Bacteria or as principal membrane
constituents in Archaea. We have shown that some terpenoids, such as cholesterol 
and α, ω-dipolar carotenoids reinforce lipid membranes by measuring the water
permeability of unilamellar vesicles. It was possible to arrange the known
membrane terpenoids in a 'phylogenetic' sequence, and a retrograde analysis led
us to conceive that single-chain polyprenyl phosphates might have been
'primitive' membrane constituents. By using an optical microscopy, we have
observed that polyprenyl phosphates containing 15 to 30 C-atoms form giant
vesicles in water in a wide pH range. The addition of 10 % molar of some
polyprenols to polyprenyl phosphate vesicles have been shown to reduce the water 
permeability of membranes even more efficiently than the equimolecular addition
of cholesterol. A 'prebiotic' synthesis of C10 and C15 prenols from C5
monoprenols was achieved in the presence of a montmorillonite clay. Hypothetical 
pathway from C1 or C2 units to 'primitive' membranes and that from 'primitive'
membranes to archaeal lipids are presented.
