Among members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily, 4-1BB,
CD27, and glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor family-related
gene (GITR) share a striking homology in the cytoplasmic domain. Here we report
the identification of a new member, activation-inducible TNFR family member
(AITR), which belongs to this subfamily, and its ligand. The receptor is
expressed in lymph node and peripheral blood leukocytes, and its expression is
up-regulated in human peripheral mononuclear cells mainly after stimulation with 
anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin.
AITR associates with TRAF1 (TNF receptor-associated factor 1), TRAF2, and TRAF3, 
and induces nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation via TRAF2. The ligand for AITR 
(AITRL) was found to be an undescribed member of the TNF family, which is
expressed in endothelial cells. Thus, AITR and AITRL seem to be important for
interactions between activated T lymphocytes and endothelial cells.
