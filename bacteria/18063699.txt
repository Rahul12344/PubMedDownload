Macrophage function depends on their in situ location. To test this hypothesis,
we examined functional changes of the C2D macrophage cell line after adoptive
transfer. In vitro, C2D macrophages reside early in the macrophage lineage and
show little functional activity. After in vivo i.p. culture, C2D macrophage cells
switch their cytokine/chemokine profile from primarily Th2 cytokines produced in 
vitro to a Th1 profile including MIP-1alpha, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. The in vivo
environment also caused C2D macrophage cells to become more phagocytic than their
in vitro counterparts. These data indicate that C2D macrophage cells exhibit
distinct functions because of in vivo signals that are absent during in vitro
culture.
