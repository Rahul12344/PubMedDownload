BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Airway bacterial infections pose a significant
challenge to the management of COPD, a disease mainly caused by cigarette
smoking. However, the mechanisms of impaired airway mucosal innate immunity
against bacteria in COPD remain unclear. We examined the effect of cigarette
smoke on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) and downstream epithelial host defence
mechanisms including the antimicrobial substance human β-defensin-2 (hBD-2).
METHODS: Brushed bronchial epithelial cells were obtained from healthy smokers
and individuals with COPD, and cultured under air-liquid interface conditions
with or without exposure to whole cigarette smoke (WCS) or Moraxella catarrhalis 
(Mc) infection. Bacterial load, hBD-2 (a molecule known to kill Mc) and PGE(2)
were measured.
RESULTS: WCS decreased Mc-induced hBD-2 expression and increased Mc load on
bronchial epithelial cells from healthy smokers and COPD patients. Moreover, WCS 
inhibited PGE(2) induction following Mc. PGE(2) was shown to increase hBD-2
production in bronchial epithelial cells from healthy smokers, but not from COPD 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that in well-differentiated human bronchial
epithelial cells, WCS may impair host defence against Mc in part through
inhibiting PGE(2) production.
