As an experimental model, most studies rely on established human cancer cell
lines; however, some genetical or phenotypical differences exist between these
cells and their original tumor. Therefore, primary cells isolated directly from
tissue are believed to be more biologically relevant tools for studying human and
animal biology. Here, we aimed to isolate primary epithelial cancer and normal
cells from breast tumors of Iranian women, for the first time. Thus, we isolated 
the epithelial and fibroblast cells from biopsy samples of patients with breast
cancer based on differential centrifugation followed by culture in selective
media. Normal epithelial cells obtained from the tissue biopsy away from the core
of the tumor, based on the pathological diagnosis. Flow cytometry analysis
indicated the positive immunoreactivity of the isolated epithelial cells against 
CD24 and Epithelial Specific Antigen (ESA/EpCAM), while they displayed a
concomitant low expression of CD44 and CD49f. In contrat to fibroblasts, the qPCR
data indicated the expression of luminal intracellular cytokeratin (Ck18) in both
normal and cancer epithelial cells, but there was no expression of
myoepithelial/basal markers, CK5 and vimentin. The epithelial cancer cells were
reactive to cytokeratin 19 (CK19) antibody, whereas the normal epithelial cells
were not. The expression of calmodulin-like protein (CLP) was also lower in the
cancer epithelial cells than in the normal ones. In conclusion, primary
epithelial normal and cancer cells, in addition to the fibroblasts were isolated 
and characterized from breast tumor of Iranian patients; and CLP expression is
suggested as a susceptibility marker for breast cancer screening.
