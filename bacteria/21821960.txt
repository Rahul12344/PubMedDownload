The utilization of natural mica as a biocatalyst support in kinetic
investigations is first described in this study. The formation of lactose caprate
from lactose sugar and capric acid, using free lipase (free-CRL) and lipase
immobilized on nanoporous mica (NER-CRL) as a biocatalyst, was evaluated through 
a kinetic study. The apparent kinetic parameters, K(m) and V(max), were
determined by means of the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. The Ping-Pong Bi-Bi
mechanism with single substrate inhibition was adopted as it best explains the
experimental findings. The kinetic results show lower K(m) values with NER-CRL
than with free-CRL, indicating the higher affinity of NER-CRL towards both
substrates at the maximum reaction velocity (V(max,app)>V(max)). The kinetic
parameters deduced from this model were used to simulate reaction rate data which
were in close agreement with the experimental values.
