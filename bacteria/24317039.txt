Signaling via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) is initiated by Src-family
kinases (SFKs). To understand how the kinase Csk, a negative regulator of SFKs,
controls the basal state and the initiation of TCR signaling, we generated mice
that express a Csk variant sensitive to an analog of the common kinase inhibitor 
PP1 (Csk(AS)). Inhibition of Csk(AS) in thymocytes, without engagement of the
TCR, induced potent activation of SFKs and proximal TCR signaling up to
phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1). Unexpectedly, increases in inositol phosphates,
intracellular calcium and phosphorylation of the kinase Erk were impaired.
Altering the actin cytoskeleton pharmacologically or providing costimulation via 
CD28 'rescued' those defects. Thus, Csk has a critical role in preventing TCR
signaling. However, our studies also revealed a requirement for actin remodeling,
initiated by costimulation, for full TCR signaling.
