UBASH3/STS/TULA is a novel two-member family, which exerts several key regulatory
effects in multiple cell types. UBASH3B/STS-1/TULA-2 is a highly active protein
tyrosine phosphatase; its major target appears to be a specific regulatory site
of protein tyrosine kinases of the Syk family, dephosphorylation of which
inhibits Syk and Zap-70 kinases and suppresses receptor signaling mediated by
these kinases. UBASH3A/STS-2/TULA exhibits substantial homology to
UBASH3B/STS-1/TULA-2, but possesses only a small fraction of phosphatase activity
of UBASH3B/STS-1/TULA-2, and thus, its regulatory effect may be based also on the
phosphatase-independent mechanisms. Critical physiologic effects of these
proteins have been demonstrated in T lymphocytes, platelets, stem cells, and
other important cell types. These proteins have also been shown to play a key
role in such pathologic conditions as autoimmunity, cancer, and thrombosis. The
review focuses on the recent studies of this important family of cellular
regulators.
