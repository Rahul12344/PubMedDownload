Corpus-dominant lymphocytic gastritis (LyG) is characterized by CD8+ T-cell
infiltration of the stomach epithelium by a so far uncharacterized mechanism.
Although Helicobacter pylori is typically undetectable in LyG, patients respond
to H. pylori antibiotic eradication therapy, suggesting a non-H. pylori microbial
trigger for the disease. Comparative microbiota analysis of specimens from LyG,
H. pylori gastritis and healthy controls precluded involvement of H. pylori in
LyG but identified Propionibacterium acnes as a possible disease trigger. In
addition, the natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) system and the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-15 are significantly upregulated in the
gastric mucosa of LyG patients, and gastric epithelial cells respond to
microbe-derived stimuli, including live P. acnes and the microbial products
short-chain fatty acids, with induction of NKG2D ligands. In contrast, H. pylori 
infection does not activate or even repress NKG2D ligands. Together, our findings
identify P. acnes as a possible causative agent for LyG, which is dependent on
the NKG2D system and IL-15 activation. © 2016 The Authors. The Journal of
