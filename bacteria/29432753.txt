Bacterial dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) 7 liberates a dipeptide with a preference
for aliphatic and aromatic penultimate residues from the N-terminus. Although
synthetic substrates are useful for activity measurements, those currently used
are problematic, because they are more efficiently degraded by DPP5. We here
aimed to develop a potent and specific substrate and found that the kcat/Km value
for Phe-Met-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (MCA) (41.40 ± 0.83 μM-1 s-1) was highest
compared to Met-Leu-, Leu-Leu-, and Phe-Leu-MCA (1.06-3.77 μM-1 s-1). Its
hydrolyzing activity was abrogated in a Porphyromonas gingivalis dpp7-knockout
strain. Conclusively, we propose Phe-Met-MCA as an ideal synthetic substrate for 
DPP7.
