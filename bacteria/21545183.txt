In this study, we identified and quantitated a tetrachlorinated compound found at
high concentrations in some samples of the meat of free-ranging wild boar (Sus
scrofa) from Southern Germany. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the
compound was a tetrachloromethoxyphenol isomer, and the subsequently synthesized 
tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol was identical with the unknown compound in wild boar.
Tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol is a known secondary metabolite of basidiomycetous
fungi, which in turn are regular feed items of the wild boar. It is extremely
likely that the wild boar have accumulated tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol by
exploiting basidiomycetes. The highest concentration in the samples (n = 22) was 
~1 mg/kg lipids tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol. This concentration was higher than
that of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT) in any of the samples. Some samples did not contain
tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol, which indicates varied preferences in fungi by wild 
boars. Our data suggest that during their entire evolution, humans have been in
contact with the natural product tetrachloro-p-methoxyphenol by consuming wild
boars.
