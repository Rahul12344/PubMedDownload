Differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) can be influenced by different
stimuli, including cytotoxic agents, certain cytokines, and contact with
pathogens. Infection may result in dysregulation of these important progenitor
cells and therefore interfere with the availability of blood cells. In this study
we analyzed the effect of bacterial infection on HSCs concerning surface marker
expression and cytokine release. Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia
enterocolitica accelerated maturation of hematopoietic progenitor cells along the
myeloid lineage, as demonstrated by the upregulation of CD13, CD14, and
costimulatory signals. By screening cytokine secretion, granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and tumor
necrosis factor-alpha were found to be induced by bacterial infection. These data
indicate that infection of HSCs with L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica
affects the differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors in vitro and may
lead to secretion of cytokines that can influence the HSC differentiation
capacity and immune response.
