OBJECTIVES: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is increasingly recognized for its
role in a variety of hepatic and systemic diseases. Its relationship to gastritis
has not been studied. We aimed at measuring gastric mucosal HGF levels in the
presence or absence of Helicobacter pylori gastritis, in peptic ulcers, and in
response to H. pylori eradication.
METHODS: Fifty one patients were studied. Patients were not entered if they had
liver disease, malignancy, or any systemic illness. HGF was measured in gastric
antral incubates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Assessments were
repeated 6 wk after a 2-wk course of anti-H. pylori triple therapy in 12
patients. Code numbers were used for blinding.
RESULTS: The median gastric mucosal HGF level was 36 ng/gm/tissue in patients
with H. pylori gastritis (n = 33) compared with 19 ng/gm in 18 negative controls 
(p = 0.0024), 18 ng/gm after the eradication of H. pylori (p = 0.021), 23 ng/gm
in all patients with ulcers (n = 10), and 26 ng/gm/tissue in H. pylori-positive
ulcers (n = 7).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric mucosal HGF levels were elevated in H. pylori gastritis and 
reduced by its eradication. These results are relevant to our understanding of
the increased gastric cell proliferation in patients with H. pylori-related
gastritis.
