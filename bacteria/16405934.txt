A mouse containing an IL-4 promoter linked to the yellow fluorescent protein
(YFP) reporter transgene was created to follow aspects of lymphocyte development 
and function. Following stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and
ionomycin, anti-CD3/CD28, antigen-specific peptide, or allogeneic cells, both CD4
and CD8 T cells expressed the transgene within 24h in a manner that was
consistent with cellular activation markers. Transgene induction was inhibited by
cyclosporine and FK506, suggesting that its activation occurs in an
NFAT-dependent manner. B lymphocytes were also able to express the transgene when
stimulated with LPS. This induction was inhibited in part by rapamycin. The
results suggest that this transgene can function as an indicator of lymphocyte
activation. Because YFP is not toxic and requires no preparation of the cells to 
view the reporter gene, this system provides a unique tool to follow lymphocyte
activation in a number of model systems, such as those involving transplantation,
allergy, and vaccine development.
