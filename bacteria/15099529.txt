Calicheamicin gamma1 (Cal gamma1) is a hydrophobic enediyne antibiotic known to
cleave the DNA and lead to apoptosis in a variety of cells. Herein, we show that 
Cal gamma1 exhibits a 1000-times stronger suppressogenic effect on
antigen-specific (diabetogenic), and na√Øve CD4 T cells than Doxorubicin (Dox),
another strong apoptotic drug. The thymic precursors and mature T cells incubated
with Cal gamma1 for only 30 min showed a drastic decrease or loss of cytokine
production and proliferation following stimulation with the immunogenic peptide, 
or with CD3 and CD28 antibodies. The suppressogenicity of Cal gamma1 correlated
with a rapid and non-selective degradation of RNA, whereas the DNA cleavage
occurred at a later time point and at higher doses. Cal gamma1 may represent a
potential therapeutic agent to eliminate self-reactive T cells in autoimmune
diseases, providing that is delivered by antigen-specific T-cell ligands.
Targeting of highly suppressogenic drugs such as Cal gamma1 to autoreactive T
cells may reduce considerable the therapeutic dose and the drug-related side
effects.
