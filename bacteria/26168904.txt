Glycerol is a by-product in the biodiesel production process and considered as
one of the prospective carbon sources for microbial fermentation including lactic
acid fermentation, which has received considerable interest due to its potential 
application. Enterococcus faecalis isolated in our laboratory produced optically 
pure L-lactic acid from glycerol in the presence of acetic acid. Gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis using [1, 2-(13)C2] acetic acid proved 
that the E. faecalis strain QU 11 was capable of converting acetic acid to
ethanol during lactic acid fermentation of glycerol. This indicated that strain
QU 11 restored the redox balance by oxidizing excess NADH though acetic acid
metabolism, during ethanol production, which resulted in lactic acid production
from glycerol. The effects of pH control and substrate concentration on lactic
acid fermentation were also investigated. Glycerol and acetic acid concentrations
of 30 g/L and 10 g/L, respectively, were expected to be appropriate for lactic
acid fermentation of glycerol by strain QU 11 at a pH of 6.5. Furthermore,
fed-batch fermentation with 30 g/L glycerol and 10 g/L acetic acid wholly
exhibited the best performance including lactic acid production (55.3 g/L),
lactic acid yield (0.991 mol-lactic acid/mol-glycerol), total yield [1.08
mol-(lactic acid and ethanol)]/mol-(glycerol and acetic acid)], and total carbon 
yield [1.06 C-mol-(lactic acid and ethanol)/C-mol-(glycerol and acetic acid)] of 
lactic acid and ethanol. In summary, the strain QU 11 successfully produced
lactic acid from glycerol with acetic acid metabolism, and an efficient
fermentation system was established without carbon loss.
