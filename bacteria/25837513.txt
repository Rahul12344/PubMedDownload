T cell immunity directed against tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions occurs in
some melanoma patients. This implicates missense mutations as a source of
patient-specific neoantigens. However, a systematic evaluation of these putative 
neoantigens as targets of antitumor immunity is lacking. Moreover, it remains
unknown whether vaccination can augment such responses. We found that a dendritic
cell vaccine led to an increase in naturally occurring neoantigen-specific
immunity and revealed previously undetected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class
I-restricted neoantigens in patients with advanced melanoma. The presentation of 
neoantigens by HLA-A*02:01 in human melanoma was confirmed by mass spectrometry. 
Vaccination promoted a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR)
repertoire in terms of both TCR-β usage and clonal composition. Our results
demonstrate that vaccination directed at tumor-encoded amino acid substitutions
broadens the antigenic breadth and clonal diversity of antitumor immunity.
