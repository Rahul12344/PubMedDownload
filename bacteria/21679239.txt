Plasmid DNA for biopharmaceutical applications is produced easily in Escherichia 
coli bacteria. The cell lysis is the most crucial step for purification of
plasmid DNA. In this paper, we describe a continuous cell alkaline lysis,
neutralization, and clarification combination process for production of plasmid
pUDK-HGF using hollow fiber ultrafiltration column as a lysis chamber and compare
the plasmid DNA yield and homogeneity with the T-connector and manual processes, 
respectively. The results show that the plasmid pUDK-HGF yield of the combination
process is 13% higher than manual lysis, twice higher than using T-connector.
When the proportion of lysed cells and neutralization solution is 3:1, the
plasmid pUDK-HGF yield can improve by 70%. This process could be easily scaled up
to meet the industrial scale for cell lysis.
