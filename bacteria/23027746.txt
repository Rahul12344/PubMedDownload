TarI is a ribitol-5-phosphate cytidylyltransferase that catalyzes the formation
of CDP-ribitol, which is involved in the biosynthesis of wall teichoic acids,
from CTP and ribitol 5-phosphate. TarI from Bacillus subtilis (BsTarI) was
purified and crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method. The
crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.78 Å and belonged to the monoclinic
space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 103.74, b = 60.97, c = 91.80 Å,
β = 113.48°. The initial structural model indicated that the crystals of BsTarI
contained a dimer in the asymmetric unit.
