Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-known cause of infections especially in
compromised patients. To neutralize this pathogen, the expression of
antimicrobial factors in epithelial cells is crucial. In particular the human
beta-defensin hBD-2 is especially active against P. aeruginosa. In this study, we
identified rhamnolipids in P. aeruginosa culture supernatants that are able to
prevent the pathogen-induced hBD-2 response in keratinocytes. The presence of
rhamnolipids within the host cells and inhibition assays suggest that
calcium-regulated pathways and protein kinase C activation are impaired by
rhamnolipids. In consequence, the induction of hBD-2 in keratinocytes by P.
aeruginosa-derived flagellin as well as the host's own hBD-2 mediator interleukin
IL-1β is inhibited. Strikingly, rhamnolipids did not affect the release of the
proinflammatory mediator interleukin IL-8 by flagellin. Thus, in addition to
their function in establishment and persistence of P. aeruginosa infections,
rhamnolipids can be engaged by P. aeruginosa for a targeted attenuation of the
innate immunity to manage its survival and colonization on compromised epithelia.
