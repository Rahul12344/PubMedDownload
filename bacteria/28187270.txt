Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia. Previous studies have
documented an important role for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed by myeloid 
cells in the recognition of K. pneumoniae and the initiation of a protective
immune response. Lung epithelial cells also express TLRs and can participate in
innate immune defense. The aim of this study was to examine the role of the
common TLR adaptor protein myeloid-differentiation factor (MyD) 88 in lung
epithelium during host defense against K. pneumoniae-induced pneumonia. To this
end, we first crossed mice expressing cre recombinase under the control of the
surfactant protein C (SftpCcre) or the club cell 10 kD (CC10cre) promoter with
reporter mice to show that SftpCcre mice mainly express cre in type II alveolar
cells, whereas CC10cre mice express cre almost exclusively in bronchiolar
epithelial cells. We then generated mice with cell-targeted deletion of MyD88 in 
type II alveolar (SftpCcre-MyD88-lox) and bronchiolar epithelial
(CC10cre-MyD88-lox) cells, and infected them with K. pneumoniae via the airways. 
Bacterial growth and dissemination were not affected by the loss of MyD88 in
SftpCcre-MyD88-lox or CC10cre-MyD88-lox mice compared with control littermates.
Furthermore, inflammatory responses induced by K. pneumoniae in the lung were not
dependent on MyD88 expression in type II alveolar or bronchiolar epithelial
cells. These results indicate that MyD88 expression in two distinct lung
epithelial cell types does not contribute to host defense during pneumonia caused
by a common human gram-negative pathogen.
