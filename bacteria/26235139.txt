The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway belonging to the Transforming Growth
Factor beta (TGFβ) family of secreted cytokines/growth factors is an important
regulator of cancer. BMP ligands have been shown to play both tumor suppressive
and promoting roles in human cancers. We have found that BMP ligands are
amplified in human ovarian cancers and that BMP receptor expression correlates
with poor progression-free-survival (PFS). Furthermore, active BMP signaling has 
been observed in human ovarian cancer tissue. We also determined that ovarian
cancer cell lines have active BMP signaling in a cell autonomous fashion.
Inhibition of BMP signaling with a small molecule receptor kinase antagonist is
effective at reducing ovarian tumor sphere growth. Furthermore, BMP inhibition
can enhance sensitivity to Cisplatin treatment and regulates gene expression
involved in platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Overall, these studies suggest
targeting the BMP pathway as a novel source to enhance chemo-sensitivity in
ovarian cancer.
