Adenosine (ADO) is an immunosuppressive molecule, which suppresses the immune
responses by interacting with specific receptors expressed by immune effector
cells. ADO is produced from ATP through the enzymatic activities of CD39 and
CD73. Alternatively, ADO can be generated starting from NAD+, which is
metabolized by the concerted action of CD38, CD203a/PC-1, and CD73. The role of
ADO in immunity has been characterized in the last years in physiology and in
pathological settings. This review examines a panel of reports focused on the
functions of ADO in the context of human autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and the
selected animal models. The final aim is to consider the role of adenosinergic
ectoenzymes and ADO receptors as novel therapeutic targets for selected diseases.
