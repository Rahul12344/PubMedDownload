BACKGROUND: Coffee production in Africa represents a significant share of the
total export revenues and influences the lives of millions of people, yet severe 
socio-economic repercussions are annually felt in result of the overall losses
caused by the coffee berry disease (CBD). This quarantine disease is caused by
the fungus Colletotrichum kahawae Waller and Bridge, which remains one of the
most devastating threats to Coffea arabica production in Africa at high altitude,
and its dispersal to Latin America and Asia represents a serious concern.
Understanding the molecular genetic basis of coffee resistance to this disease is
of high priority to support breeding strategies. Selection and validation of
suitable reference genes presenting stable expression in the system studied is
the first step to engage studies of gene expression profiling.
RESULTS: In this study, a set of ten genes (S24, 14-3-3, RPL7, GAPDH, UBQ9,
VATP16, SAND, UQCC, IDE and β-Tub9) was evaluated to identify reference genes
during the first hours of interaction (12, 48 and 72 hpi) between resistant and
susceptible coffee genotypes and C. kahawae. Three analyses were done for the
selection of these genes considering the entire dataset and the two genotypes
(resistant and susceptible), separately. The three statistical methods applied
GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, allowed identifying IDE as one of the most
stable genes for all datasets analysed, and in contrast GADPH and UBQ9 as the
least stable ones. In addition, the expression of two defense-related
transcripts, encoding for a receptor like kinase and a pathogenesis related
protein 10, were used to validate the reference genes selected.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results provide guidelines for reference gene(s) 
selection towards a more accurate and widespread use of qPCR to study the
interaction between Coffea spp. and C. kahawae.
