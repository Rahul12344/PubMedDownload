Dynamic regulation of TCR expression levels plays important roles in modulating
T-cell responses during T-cell development and in mature T cells. TCR expression 
levels are determined by the rate constants for synthesis, endocytosis,
recycling, and degradation. This review examines the rate constants, the
molecular mechanisms, and the proposed physiological roles of TCR trafficking in 
resting and stimulated T cells. In resting T cells, the TCR slowly and
constitutively cycles between the plasma membrane and the intracellular
compartment. Constitutive TCR cycling is dependent on the di-leucine-based (diL) 
receptor-sorting motif in the TCR subunit CD3g and might play a role in quality
control of the TCR. TCR triggering induces an enhancement in the endocytic rate
constant leading to TCR down-regulation. At least two pathways exist for
endocytosis of triggered TCR. One is dependent on protein tyrosine kinase
activity leading to ubiquitination of the TCR, whereas the other is dependent on 
protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of the diL motif. In addition,
nontriggered TCR are endocytosed (co-modulated) by the PKC/CD3g-dependent
pathway. TCR down-regulation might attenuate signaling and/or might ensure an
internal store of TCR that can be rerouted to the immunological synapse during
the encounter with an antigen-presenting cell.
