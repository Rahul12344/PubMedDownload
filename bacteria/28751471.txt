Reaction centers are pigment-protein complexes that drive photosynthesis by
converting light into chemical energy. It is believed that they arose once from a
homodimeric protein. The symmetry of a homodimer is broken in heterodimeric
reaction-center structures, such as those reported previously. The 2.2-angstrom
resolution x-ray structure of the homodimeric reaction center-photosystem from
the phototroph Heliobacterium modesticaldum exhibits perfect C2 symmetry. The
core polypeptide dimer and two small subunits coordinate 54 bacteriochlorophylls 
and 2 carotenoids that capture and transfer energy to the electron transfer chain
at the center, which performs charge separation and consists of 6
(bacterio)chlorophylls and an iron-sulfur cluster; unlike other reaction centers,
it lacks a bound quinone. This structure preserves characteristics of the
ancestral reaction center, providing insight into the evolution of
photosynthesis.
