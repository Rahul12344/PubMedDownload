CD28 costimulatory signals are required for T-cell proliferation and lymphokine
production. In this work, the functional conservation of CD28 was studied in
avian gammadelta T cells. The avian CD28 molecule is expressed on all alphabeta T
cells and is capable of giving a costimulatory signal. Most peripheral gammadelta
T cells are CD28 negative; however, we identified a CD28-positive gammadelta
T-cell subset from peripheral blood comprising about 12% of gammadelta T cells.
The peripheral CD28+ gammadelta T-cell subset included all CD8+ gammadelta T
cells known to be a responding subset during activation. After polyclonal
activation, the frequency of CD28+ gammadelta T cells was increased and the
activation also up-regulated CD5, CD25 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class II molecules. These changes were detected after both polyclonal and
antigen-specific T-cell activation. In addition, we also showed that CD28 can
give a costimulatory signal to gammadelta T cells and that this signal leads to
up-regulation of IL-2 and bcl-x transcripts. These results indicate that the
function of CD28 is evolutionarily conserved and can already be detected in avian
gammadelta T cells.
