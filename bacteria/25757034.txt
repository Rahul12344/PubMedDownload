Myxopyronin is a natural α-pyrone antibiotic from the soil bacterium Myxococcus
fulvus Mx f50. Myxopyronin inhibits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) by binding to
a part of the enzyme not targeted by the clinically used rifamycins. This mode of
action makes myxopyronins promising molecules for the development of novel
broad-spectrum antibacterials. We describe the derivatization of myxopyronins by 
an advanced mutasynthesis approach as a first step towards this goal.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the biosynthetic machinery was used to block
myxopyronin biosynthesis at different stages. The resulting mutants were fed with
diverse precursors that mimic the biosynthetic intermediates to restore
production. Mutasynthon incorporation and production of novel myxopyronin
derivatives were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS. This work sets the stage for accessing
numerous myxopyronin derivatives, thus significantly expanding the chemical space
of f α-pyrone antibiotics.
