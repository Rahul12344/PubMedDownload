OBJECTIVE: Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) is one of the
cornerstones for the understanding of immune responses prevailing in the tumor
microenvironment. We studied TILs from squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix ex
vivo without proliferating them in vitro before analysis.
METHODS: Whereas TILs were magnetic activated cell separation enriched and flow
sorted into CD4 CD25 (regulatory T cells [Tregs]), CD4 CD25 (effector T cells
[Teffs]) were directly purified by flow cytometry, and both these subsets were
characterized phenotypically and functionally. Tissue sections were probed for
interleukin 4 (IL-4) and interferon γ.
RESULTS: Effector T cells constitutively expressed both interferon γ and IL-4
prototypical cytokines of TH1 and TH2, respectively, and were able to proliferate
and secrete higher quantities of both cytokines in response to anti-CD3/anti-CD28
and autologous tumor lysates. Only 53% of cervical cancer Tregs were FOXP3,
elaborated transforming growth factor β1, and IL-10 and were able to inhibit both
T helper subsets.
CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral Teffs represented functionally active subsets of both
TH1 and TH2 that were not anergic but were suppressed by multiple Treg subsets,
which comprised FOXP3 + Tregs and Tregs secreting transforming growth factor β1
and IL-10. These results imply that the microenvironment of cervical carcinomas
harbored both TH1 and TH2 subsets of CD4 Teffs that were functionally active but 
were perhaps unable to perform because of the overpowering effect of Tregs.
