OBJECTIVES: The aim was to analyse the population pharmacokinetics of colistin
and to explore the relationship between colistin exposure and time to death.
METHODS: Patients included in the AIDA randomized controlled trial were treated
with colistin for severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative 
bacteria. All subjects received a 9 million units (MU) loading dose, followed by 
a 4.5 MU twice daily maintenance dose, with dose reduction if creatinine
clearance (CrCL) < 50 mL/min. Individual colistin exposures were estimated from
the developed population pharmacokinetic model and an optimized two-sample per
patient sampling design. Time to death was evaluated in a parametric survival
analysis.
RESULTS: Out of 406 randomized patients, 349 contributed pharmacokinetic data.
The median (90% range) colistin plasma concentration was 0.44 (0.14-1.59) mg/L at
15 minutes after the end of first infusion. In samples drawn 10 hr after a
maintenance dose, concentrations were >2 mg/L in 94% (195/208) and 44% (38/87) of
patients with CrCL ≤120 mL/min, and >120 mL/min, respectively. Colistin
methanesulfonate sodium (CMS) and colistin clearances were strongly dependent on 
CrCL. High colistin exposure to MIC ratio was associated with increased hazard of
death in the multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI): 1.07
(1.03-1.12)). Other significant predictors included SOFA score at baseline (HR
1.24 (1.19-1.30) per score increase), age and Acinetobacter or Pseudomonas as
index pathogen.
DISCUSSION: The population pharmacokinetic model predicted that >90% of the
patients had colistin concentrations >2 mg/L at steady state, but only 66% at
4 hr after start of treatment. High colistin exposure was associated with poor
kidney function, and was not related to a prolonged survival.
