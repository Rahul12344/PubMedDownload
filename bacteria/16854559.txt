Two anthrax toxin receptors have been identified, tumor endothelial marker 8
(TEM8) and capillary morphogenesis protein 2 (CMG2). Both receptors have been
shown to be capable of facilitating the entry of Bacillus anthracis exotoxins
into the cytosol of susceptible cells. The levels of TEM8 and CMG2 RNA
transcripts present in human primary macrophages derived from multiple unrelated 
donors and primary mouse macrophages have not been well described. In this
communication, we examined the expression of mRNA transcripts of TEM8 and CMG2 in
primary human and mouse macrophages and mouse tissues by standard and
quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Our results indicate that CMG2 transcripts are
preferentially expressed over TEM8 transcripts in primary human and mouse
macrophages as compared to immortalized cell lines.
