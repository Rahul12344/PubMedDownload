Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), the specialized strains of E
coli that cause most extraintestinal E coli infections, represent a major but
little-appreciated health threat. Although the reasons for their evolution remain
mysterious, by virtue of their numerous virulence traits ExPEC clearly possess a 
unique ability to cause disease outside the host intestinal tract. Broader
appreciation of the existence and importance of ExPEC and better understandings
of their distinctive virulence mechanisms, reservoirs, and transmission pathways 
may lead to effective preventive interventions against the morbid and costly
infections ExPEC cause.
