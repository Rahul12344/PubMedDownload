HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for 25% of all cases and has a poor
prognosis. Although progress has been made in understanding signal transduction, 
little is known of how HER2 achieves gene regulation. We performed whole genome
expression analysis on a HER2⁺ and HER2⁻ breast cancer cell lines and compared
these results to expression in 812 primary tumors stratified by their HER2
expression level. Chip-on-chip with anti-RNA polymerase II was compared among
breast cancer cell lines to identify genes that are potentially activated by
HER2. The expression levels of these HER2-dependent POL II binding genes were
determined for the 812 HER2+/- breast cancer tissues. Genes differentially
expressed between HER2+/- cell lines were generally regulated in the same
direction as in breast cancer tissues. We identified genes that had POLII binding
in HER2⁺ cell lines, but without significant gene expression. Of 737 such genes
"poised" for expression in cell lines, 113 genes were significantly
differentially expressed in breast tumors in a HER2-dependent manner. Pathway
analysis of these 113 genes revealed that a large group of genes were associated 
with stem cell and progenitor cell control as indicated by networks centered on
NANOG, SOX2, OCT3/4. HER2 directs POL II binding to a large number of genes in
breast cancer cells. A "poised" class of genes in HER2⁺ cell lines with POLII
binding and low RNA expression but is differentially expressed in primary tumors,
strongly suggests a role of the microenvironment and further suggests a role for 
stem cells proliferation in HER2-regulated breast cancer tissue.
