Induction of human beta defensin-2 (HBD-2) by mycobacteria has been reported.
However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which mycobacteria up-regulates HBD-2 gene
expression in epithelial cells remains poorly understood. In this work, we
provide evidence that the induction of HBD-2 mRNA in response to Mycobacterium
bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 
pretreatment with a cell-permeable BAPTA-AM, which chelates intracellular
calcium. Our data also demonstrate that HBD-2 mRNA induction by M. bovis in A549 
lung epithelial cells requires activation of calmodulin. Interestingly, HBD-2
mRNA expression in response to M. bovis BCG was attenuated by pretreatment with
SB203580 (an inhibitor of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]), but not
by an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK): PD98059.
Furthermore, we found that a second p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB202190) significantly
blocked M. bovis BCG-mediated HBD-2 induction in A549 lung epithelial cells.
Together, these data suggest that M. bovis BCG induces HBD-2 mRNA expression in
A549 lung epithelial cells at least in part mediated through intracellular
calcium flux as well as activation of signaling protein of p38MAPK, but not ERK.
