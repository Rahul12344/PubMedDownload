The primary trigger of polymorphic light eruption (PLE) remains to be uncovered. 
We hypothesize that PLE may be initiated by elements resulting from UV-induced
damage to microbial communities of the skin, leading to a cascade of events
eventually resulting in the skin rash of the disease. One mechanism by which
epidermal injury by UV radiation could trigger PLE are danger signals such as
damage or pathogen associated molecular patterns DAMP/PAMPs or
commensal-associated molecular patterns (CAMPs). Such triggers could be produced 
due to UV-induced stress on microbial communities of the skin and exacerbate
inflammatory responses by inducing the innate immune system through antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) such as psoriasin, RNase7, HBD-2 and LL-37. These AMPs also
actively take part in initiating adaptive immunity. That signals derived from
microbial rather than human elements may initiate PLE is supported by series of
observations, including the PLE-protective effect of topically applied
microbial-derived DNA repair enzymes.
